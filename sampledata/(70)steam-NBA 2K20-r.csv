11,"What kind of dogshit company design an ""offline"" gamemode that you can't access after 2 years when they shutdown the online server. A complete scam"
12,Do not waste your money on a scam like this.
13,2k online is no longer avail
14,They shut the servers down you can't even play mycareer. Lame.
15,too buggy
16,same as every other game really
17,the servers are down so u can even play the career mode. 2k are absolute clowns
18,Unplayable without a controller
19,"I mean the fact that they took it off Steam tells you all you need to know right? 
"
20,"__DO NOT BUY__
- I completely agreed, I just reinstalled this pile of garbage, that's what it is now, that I can not access my career and my team. Uninstalling now. If this is going to happen with each of NBA 2K iteration, I don't want it. Servers down = losing my career mode. Wtf man, the whole point of the game for some players.

__DO NOT BUY__

YOU CANNOT ACCESS MOST OF THE GAMES ADVERTISED FEATURES BECAUSE THEY SHUT THE SERVERS DOWN.
THE GAME IS FUN BUT MYCAREER AND MYTEAM ARE NONFUNCTIONAL NOW BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE ONLINE AND THE SERVERS ARE DOWN AND WONT BE BACK.

CHANGE THE GAME DESCRIPTION AND REMOVE THE FEATURES BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER INCLUDED"

24,"I'll never buy another 2k game. The only reason I bought this was because they put it on sale (for the first time ever) And why did they do that? Because they were going to shut down the servers at the end of 2021 (yes, the very next year after the title of the game) Why are they going to shut down the servers after only 2 years? So you can't play My Career or My Team (the two most popular modes) Why don't they want you to play those? Because they want to FORCE you to spend another $60-$70 buying the same game with a new year on it."
25,Make 2k fun again!
26,very good game but alot cheaters
27,...
28,"This is a really fun game. Gameplay is great and runs flawlessly on the Steam Deck. 

The issue is that the MyCareer mode is online only. Which is a stupid anti piracy tactic which punishes paying players. The real problem is they shut down the servers on a 3 year old game that still plays and looks great. Meaning you can't even play MyCareer mode at all anymore. This is just a shitty tactic to force people to buy a newer entry in the franchise. 

That's enough for me to never purchase another 2K game again. Have been a fan of 2K dating all the way back to the early 2000's, but these shady practices should be illegal and they've lost me and probably countless others as a result of their greed."
29,to many errors
30,гавно
31,very nice when u dunke on lebruun jahames
32,buggy
33,it used to be good but now the servers ar shut down

36,Fuck 12
37,9
38,Make an anticheat
39,"You know I'm ballin', usual like Kobe"
40,"why the heck my career mode is unavailable. I don't give a damn about online part about career mode let me play offline which is so fucking simple to configure , you guys are suck"
41,"THSI GAME IS DOGSHIT 
"
42,very grape
43,"You got me at 2020, clearly."
44,"Because the servers were shut down in late 2021 and the only offline game mode is ""play now"", myCareer and myTeam are unplayable. It used to be that even after the servers were no longer online, players could enjoy offline play. Paying full price for a game that comes with an expiry date is incredibly unfair."
45,good game
46,2K closed down multiplayer services which affects more than half the games content. Don't buy now just buy 2k22 for 10 bucks.
47,"2K releases the same game every year and forces you to be online to use its main features so that they can force obsolescence. I bought the game for $10, and I can't see myself paying for NBA 2K again."
48,You pay for a game that becomes completely unplayable due to them taking the servers down 2 years after its release. What garbage.
49,"very fun game. try online mode
"
50,Dookie

"
52,I played this game to relive the time when the Lakers were good. I got this game from a bundle. Don't buy this dead game.
53,It's a predatory business practice. The game push you to spend real money on virtual items which will be lost forever in 2 years when they shut down the server and turn this game into a complete junk. Won't buy any 2K games anymore.
54,Good
55,NBA 2k20 shut down their servers on 31st Dec 2021. They removed all features related to online modes and made it unplayable. Paying for a game that only enables you to play for 2 years is nonsense. Will not support NBA 2K anymore.
56,"So you buy this game, only they can shut down the server any time they want, and you have no option to play the content offline. OK. lucky i bought this game at discount and not any in-game currency."
57,i got it when 2k21 was already out because it was cheaper and of course the servers are shut down so now i cant play mycareer anymore because you need to be able to connect to their online servers which you can no longer do

absolute sh!tties... online is like playing a tumbleweed that wont buffer or better yet a hood tumble weed aka the plastic bag can do nothing but dunk, the next two copies are the same trash online (and off they actually just did the rosters and said SCREW US ON PC WE AT EAT B 00TY GAMES DONT GIVE A FRENCHMANS F ABOUT YA!)

playing on horizon with a friend on streams just to jostle E As jimmies smore and will be sure that it plays better than their f ing geriatric servers.

ciao loves"
59,"Please don't buy this game. 2k decided to shutdown servers for this after 2.5 years of release and you can't play even mycareer anymore, the game mode that most people plays. Yes, it is singleplayer and offline gamemode but you can't play it because it needs connection for some reason. Yeap, you read it right."
60,"The game was actually pretty terrible since the first time I started playing. But let's say I kept playing due to my love for the sport and the fact I like to play My Carrer mode. Honestly I play 99% of time My Carrer so I can't really tell if the rest sucks or not, what I can say is that I didn't dislike My Carrer too much, I even liked various choices you had and some things you go trought your Carrer. What is not good at all in this game are the animations, not so various and way not done so well considering it's 2K20, the player movements, the fact that 90% of the time if you have to lose, get a point or not it's all so scrypted and bad done. And most importantly, I don't have to be forced to buy the game every year to play. Because yes, servers closed only one year after the release and you can do nearly NOTHING offline, as good as trashing a game and never use it anymore. Couldn't play My Carrer anymore, just like I couldn't play any other modes apart from ""Play Now"". Really terrible, they didn't even tell in advance they were closing servers, they didn't keep anything playable offline and while all this was going on, they kept spamming ""BUY VC"" in your face. No.
There are way too many things to say on this game, sadly most are bad things."
61,"They've shut down servers after 2 years, making 99% of game modes unplayable. Don't buy another nba 2k produt every again. Pathetic decisions. We should all be given refunds for this ripoff."
62,Shut down the servers. Greediest move of all time lmao fuck off 2k
63,no server no game
64,"They shut down the servers now I cant play career mode. I have all my hours into one career mode that I cant even access anymore, pretty much the game is useless except for quick play which is only used when you have a irl guest. Who shuts down servers after 1 year of play?? Halo lasted more than 10 ffs

FUCK YOU 2K"
65,as
66,"I recommend this game for any NBA fan, there are times that the game is crashing and minor lags during game"
67,"cannot connect to the game server
"
68,"So 2k can decide to take your money, brick your game after 2 years by removing 99% of the functionality and preventing you from playing the mode most people buy the game for and you have no recourse and are ineligible for a refund even though you haven't received the product you paid for and wouldn't have bought it if you knew they would brick it after 2 years. Great company, great game, definitely buy the new ones"
69,"The vast majority of the game is no longer available despite achievements still showing as if they are obtainable :/ 
Piss-scummy business practices from the AAA game world as usual."
70,"Servers offline = NO CAREER MODE. 

I expected the servers being offline to impact certain things but not to completely make the career mode unplayable among other modes. 


I waited to play 2k20 because the servers going offline in 2k17 deleted my career player and created team in that game but at least career is still playable in offline if I created a new character.

  Not so in 2k20. 

 You just cant even access career mode which could easily be done in offline but nope rather then offer an offline career they just shut it down completely meaning no created player story and many of the achievements being unavailable as well as the game mode unplayable."
71,Thank you 2k for making MyCareer online only and then discontinuing online connection for 2k20. 300 hours gone because of this scum f***k company.
72,It actually has a good shot meter
73,Game was fun up until I downloaded it to play MyCareer and found out that you need online to play and the servers don't exist.....Big L for 2K and the reviews on the rest of their games
74,this game makes me throw up all over my setup
75,"You can't play MyCareer since servers are offline?!?! But you can play 2k16 for example?!

What a disaster this game turned out to be.

Used to be best basketball game ever. Best game ever.

Really shame."
76,trash game trash servers
77,Completely useless after the servers are shutdown. Cant even play the offline modes bc of 2ks greed. I got this shit for free and I still got ripped off lmao.
78,Shut the servers down so you can't even play 90% of the game. Not even an offline MyCareer is available. F
79,"FUCK THIS GAME. havent played a while then tried to get on and basically cant even play cuz the servers are shut down. not even a 5 year old game. FUCK EM
"
80,"can't play mycareer offline and they shut down the servers, I can't even play the game I paid for, how is this shit legal"
81,"This game is shitty.
You can't even play your created player."
82,"This game is NOT IT. 
2K need to do better 

2 / 10 pumpkins"
83,VERY NICE
84,"yarrrrrak gibi 
"
85,When I only purchase the game for chill single player career mode it's disappointing for them to make that require an online connection then shut down the server so I can't continue to enjoy the game experience I already bought and started playing
86,"I will never buy another title from 2K again.  I went back in to resume MyCareer mode and found out the servers were taken offline and can no longer play this game.  This is unacceptable and should not be accepted from purchasing a game.  Fool me once, but you will never fool me again."
87,"spurgt
"
88,Can't play after 2 years ?!?!?! because servers are taken down. Whats the point of buying another one?
89,easy to grind VC than 2k22
90,I enjoy playing the game it's fun to play MyGM & make the playoffs.
91,Just tried to play NBA2k20 and learned that my career mode doesn't work. This game was $60. I'm NEVER buying another 2k game again. Looks like I'm going to visit my ol'friends at the bay to play 2k games.
92,racist game
93,never buy any game from 2gay games they have been shut down all the servers so everything you had all gone XD mfers
94,"They probably feel nice about not forcing you to buy it every year, but every other year..."
95,"lots of black dudes, i like it :)"
96,w
97,sdwq
98,Switched servers off....
99,Recommended it prior to server shut downs...I enjoyed playing Mycareer but obviously since servers are gone...Now I can no longer do that.
100,"give me 2k22
"
101,"2k shut down the servers so half the game is not playable anymore. Thank god I'm not dumb enough to buy VC or I'd be even more pis*ed off than I already am. I won't be buying another 2k game for a LONG time. Hopefully others do the same like they did with the garbage 2k WWE games and 2K will finally stop pulling this greedy BS. Side note, for all the well deserved flak EA gets for Madden being trash, at least the game is still playable 2 years after release. F U 2K."
102,"game sucks
"
103,booo tomatoes tomatoes
104,I spent way too much time and money on it. This is garbo
105,"No mycareer due to server shutdown, only reason I got this game"
106,awsome
107,You really couldnt keep mycareer accessible after the servers were shutdown? Eat thy derriere 2k. Insert your tongue into my sphincter.  Take a lick of my lower intestine you fuckers.
108,OK
109,after server shutdown cant even play mycareer. All the builds that i took quite some time to build juz left there no longer accessible
110,NOT WORTH IT THEY SHUT DOWN SERVERS 2K CAN SUCK MY BALLS !
111,a little wierd but its a god game
112,Can't play all offline game modes since the new game came out essentially making this a subscription and not a game.
113,"Playing singleplayer MyCareer can be fun (though I haven't played a basketball game outside of nba action 98 and nba live 2004 in the past 2 decades)

But the two year support cycle means that you can't play 2k20 anymore. basically forcing you to upgrade or downgrade to another nba 2k game. I don't want the newest 2k and don't need updated rosters, etc. I just wanted to continue playing with old rosters and myplayer but it's not possible.

Basically it's fun while it lasts but because the modes that use VC get disabled after 2 years, the part of the game i wanted to play(which is singleplayer) stops working. The amount I grind out as a byproduct from playing the game is okay with me but I'd never buy VC with real money."
114,yessir  W game
115,Best NBA ever
116,<3
117,jkdtyj
118,I can no longer play my Career in offline mode.
119,200 hours and actual money invested into VC for single player career mode. I wanted to go back and re-live my career but apparently I was only leasing the single player game for 2 years. Servers shut down and ended the fun. This should be illegal.
120,"If you're like most EA/2K players that keep accounts around forever to keep going back and player where you left off. Look at another basketball game... 2 yr and the servers get taking offline.. hours of game-play wasted and not to mention $$$$.

Its sad because they clearly have bad reviews but somehow they continue to put out roster updates and charge $63.99.
Do not buy EA or 2K product... throw your money into something that wont erase itself in 2yr."
121,"its good
"
122,Only after 2 years EA shuts off the online servers and makes the game unplayable. Whenever I go into an actual game the FPS drops to 4 (not computer issues) and there seems to not be a fix online so its probably just EA forcing you to buy the new one. Get the new one instead of this one.
123,removed my career and shut down the servers.
124,good game to play!
125,Burn your money instead of buying this game. We cannot support these monsters!
126,nice game to play
127,草泥马的给我关服了 之前刷的东西白忙活
128,Rip single player
129,You can only play the games during 2 years. Then it's shutted down. 2k is a Scam
130,"Way too many hours played in this. MyTeam was somewhat fun and addicting but waaaaaaayyyyyyy too grindy, annoyingly so. Then to shut the servers off after two years is ridiculous. If 2k cares so much about money, do the smart thing that would bring way more players into the game. Make a F2P NBA2k where you don't need a new game every year and have your in-game purchases. 

Love to know that all the player's hours of effort will be gone after only two years, with no way to access it offline. Borderline monkey IQ thinking. Every 2k player should know this a realize the grind and effort isn't even close to worth it. Then people will stop buying these cash grab games."
131,Better than 2k25
132,"Soooooooo, 2K decided to close the server down and now I am unable to play MyCareer offline? thats some major BS........"
133,So I bought a game for 30$ to play it for 6 months? thanks for robbing me and teaching me this lesson
134,Delete my saves 1 more time and I'll destroy your booty with a meat cleaver.
135,Disabling MyCareer after 2 years is outrageous. I wasn't aware that a large portion of the game I bought was just a rental.
136,Servers have shut down so career mode doesn't even work
137,i got it for $5 and it was barely worth it i guess
138,how to refund this sh1t....
139,problem with connecting server. already linked my 2k acc witrh steam and no luck. stilol going through same shite. can not play mycareer myteam myshite
140,"Screw you 2k Sports.  Shutting down servers for a game in less than 2 years.  All my effort in career mode, gone.  Never again will you get my money.  I'll play wii sports basketball before I play another 2k game."
141,scam.
142,ok.
143,this crap wont allow me to update and log in to their server saying it doesnt recognize me.
144,"I play MyCareer, and nothing else. I want my money back when they shut off the one thing they advertise the most."
145,:d :d :d :d :d :d :d :d :d :d :d :d :d :d :d
146,Great game
147,"Servers shut down after 2 years, and now the game cannot be played (even single player modes like MyCareer).  I didn't buy this, turns out I rented it.  Worst corporate greed in an industry filled with it.  Never buy another 2K Games game."
148,Bad game
149,i like the game
150,Servers off
151,"Please do not buy this game if you want to play MyCareer, since the servers were shut down it is not playable.
Save your money and time."
152,"I just cannot believe they closed down the servers after only 2 years!
You gotta realize that without the servers, 90% of the game is gone! It stops working... All your saves, settings, gone! MyCareer mode gone which is the best part for people who want a great single player experience ignoring the online part. 
Such a jerk move by the management..."
153,"cant play online
"
154,"Turning off single-player experiences on a $60 title because servers are shut down is just ridiculous. NBA 2K has just become a waste of money, dont bother."

156,Removing My Career mode along side with shutting down the server is almost a scam to me
157,The reviews speak for themselves. Just another classic instance of EA acting as money hungry hacks
158,none
159,"Really? Fucking Story mode is available only if you're online? What kind of bullshit is this, they turned off the servers wtf fuck u 2k"
160,Trash company. My career unplayable offline.
161,ez game
162,Can't play mycareer because 2k are greedy fucks and make it so you have to be online but the servers shut down last year. Fuck 2k
163,it's good on heavy discount.
164,"Came back to the game after a year hoping to play some MyCareer after all this time, 2K being 2K they obviously had to find another way to steal players from their money so of course after the expensive VC packs that gives up barely enough to make a few interesting upgrades you now have to be online to play MyCareer, a gamemode that at its root is supposed to be singleplayer only, so of course when they shut down the servers you can't play any gamemode including MyCareer, don't think of buying this game even if it's on sale, you have literally 0 playable options after the servers are shut down. it's amazing how they can keep getting away with that."
165,jit fine for a game that's 2 years old now
166,trash ass game you cant even play my career or any mode as a matter waste of money
167,"Just want to play My career in peace, but they just shut down the servers and now the mode is unplayable which doesnt make sense to need online services in the first place. 2K hands down is the best."
168,"Single-player was a fun experience... if you ever had the time to play the game as much as you could before the server were shut down forever.

I understand the logistics behind terms and conditions to use a product I buy but to permanently shut down my career and other single-player-related game modes is ridiculous.

NBA 2K is the only video game franchise to permanently shut down single-player servers as well as multiplayer servers.

The reason why they do this every 2 years is most likely due to money (in-game currency).

I never bought in-game currency in any 2K game to boost my character's stats, but I instead put in my time and effort into this game while having as much fun as I could playing it.

I can remember the days of grinding 2K finally paying off in single-player when I first started to drop 30 points in every game like MJ, and now it's all down the drain.

NBA 2K is the same concept every year.

This was my second NBA 2K purchase on PC. NBA 2K16 being my first and NBA 2K21 being my last when I got it.

The story behind NBA 2K16 was memorable. Vic Van Lier was a long-time, best friend of Frequency Vibrations (Freq) and he was with you almost every basketball game sitting court-side until he started getting himself into more trouble time and time again.

Now with NBA 2K20 things are a little more basic as Che stands up for his teammate who was injured and eventually lost his scholarship. After speaking out against the coach, the college, and the system, Che drops out with one semester left, jeopardizing his path to the NBA.

Nowadays with NBA 2K21, we have a regular guy with the name of ""OG"" with no direction or backstory to the NBA.

NBA 2K is losing its roots as a single-player arcade recreational game that was all about basketball.

All that's left of NBA 2K and the future of it in my eyes is in-game currency.

I never paid to have a better advantage, but 2 years is too short for a proper length to be able to enjoy the story of NBA 2K and to finally be one of the greatest of all time."
169,"-Too many Microtransactions!
-Too many bugs on initial release
-Unrealistic balance of defense vs offense
-Copy & paste parks from previous NBA2K games
-Online server inconsistency (LAG)
-Incomplete rosters
-Inaccurate player ratings"
170,I want a refund.
171,"Game no longer works with any mode most players would be interested in, outside of myGm and Play Now. Would not support any 2k products if their lifespan is this short for a full priced game."
172,"Sure, it's a 2 year old game and sure I have over 600 played, but modes locked behind the internet (unless they are strictly Multiplayer or Co-Op modes) is stupid.  Wanted to get back to my career, which I play solo, but can't even access it due to it being locked behind online connectivity and what do you know, 2K shut the servers down a couple of months ago and provide no way to play the mode offline.  Because of stuff like this, and others, I could never recommend a NBA2K game to anyone on gp."
173,I don't remember 2 minutes of the 1000 hours I played
174,Awesome
175,"Server shutdown in 2021, cant even log into mycarrer. Not worth getting, broken game shame on 2k"
176,good game
177,Online not connecting
178,I played all of an hour and boom. gone.
179,Servers were closed. R.I.P. myCareer 2K20.
180,Well... shutting down the servers after a couple years is just plain stupid and it shows how much they're all about money and nothing but money. I was about to jump in and play a little bit (I don't play much) and realised they had shut the servers down. But what really bothers me is MyCareer is single player and you still cant play it. There's no excuse as to why you shouldn't. Disgusting business tactics =/
181,Rest in peace NBA2k20
182,last time i will ever buy a 2k basketball game. i put so many hours in myteam and career mode and now i cant play them even if the server is shutdown.
183,"NBA without Mycarrer. 
Im speechless................................"
184,I thought it was fun.
185,its good
186,"The my career mode was removed when the servers were shut down. Its single player orientated, and i have no idea why they would make it unavailable. Comes off as a scum way to make players buy the new years. As someone who only played the my career mode, i have no reason to play this game anymore."
187,"Same reason everyone else is yelling about, never buying a 2k title again when at any point they can just stop you from playing the game offline."
188,have great game and with controller

198,will not let me load into mycareer and says i need to connect online. screw this game
199,"The servers were shut down on December 31st, 2021 without a warning on Steam. The last news post was an advertisement for 2K21. The server shutdown makes effectively all of the game modes inaccessible, including single-player modes. I purchased this game months before the release of 2K21, so it was still the latest version to have been released at that time. And I had about one and half years before single-player modes are not longer accessible. I would warn all others to not purchase any 2K products, at least until such extreme practices are addressed."
200,"I loved this game until they took down the server. All i really enjoyed playing was the MyCareer Mode, not that is not possible despite purchasing the game or any additional Virtual Currency. This was disappointing and will keep my from purchasing future versions of this game."
201,"For the most part, this is a pretty standard NBA 2K game, if you've played one you've played them all, and this particular installation doesn't really seem to be an exception to that rule."
202,"seriously fuck you 2k.

how can these fucks get away with bullshit like this?"
203,When the servers were taken offline they took down mycareer. You can still play playerlock myleague but its not the same experience.
204,good
205,nc
206,Worse purchase ive ever made
207,Fuck 2k. I'll never buy another one of their dogshit games. MyTeam is so blatantly pay to win and they shut down the servers every 2 years so all the money and time you spent gets flushed down the toilet. RIP to the band I dropped on this game when I was 16 and retarded.
208,"Came back to play the My Career game mode and come to find out that the servers were killed at the end of 2021... and renders almost all aspects of the game unplayable.

If this is the way the company handles their products I can not recommend to purchase anything made by 2k now or in the future. You clearly do not own any level of the game and purely only rent it at a premium price until they decide to cut the cord and move on to the new title for you to rent again at a premium."
209,super e kak
210,"RIP, servers. RIP, NBA2K."
211,They deleted my profile after hours upon hours of trying to finish the myteam part just for buying the same game on nintendo switch. They deleted both accounts the next day making myteam unplayable on either my pc or switch. Same happened to my nba2k21 accounts just for having 1 account on epic and the other on nintendo.
212,funy
213,cant play my career

216,"I guess this game could only be played for a year, they shut the servers down."
217,"Servers were shut down, game is unplayable"
218,bad game
219,"They took down the servers which also MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY MYCAREER MODE, THAT IS ENTIRELY OFFLINE

This is obviously done to try to force players to buy newer games, that have brought absolutely no changes for the last 2 games. Absolutely shameful behaviour from 2k"
220,Shit game
221,No offline mycareer!!!
222,Can't play mycareer anymore after grinding for hours. Closed the servers so people will buy newer 2k games. FUCK YOU 2K!!!
223,"File size is way too fucking big considering the ""content"" (or lack, thereof) within the game. 83.1 GB would be fine if the game were as big and open-ended as something like RDR2, but a file size that big on a fucking sports game? Unacceptable. This game is far too abysmal to be worth even half that size.

NBA 2K20 is yet another trash sports game made by a trash company who has been pumping out the same shit, and it has been that way ever since 2K16. Nothing innovative. Nothing groundbreaking. Nothing even remotely worth mentioning. 

It's not quite as bad as Madden and certainly not as horrendous as FIFA but still very bad on its own. As long as this annual format of releasing shit ass games continues, products (or should I say cash grabs) like this will continue to be released, and the brainless fans, of which are still somehow abundant, will continue to buy the game at full price and give 2K their well-undeserved money. 

This game isn't even worth anything over $20. And it's debatably not worth getting for free considering its unnecessarily humongous file size."
224,"Shutting down their server.
No way to access MC MT mode.
Forcing PPL to buy their new 2k22.
NICE MOVE 2K!"
225,cant play anymore bc they shut down servers
226,Dang son dis be good
227,"The servers were shut down on December 31st without a warning on Steam. The last news post is from August 7th, 2020 and it's an advertisement for 2K21. The server shutdown makes many of the game modes inaccessible, including single-player mode MyCareer. I'm not purchasing anymore 2K products until this is addressed and based on their history I doubt it will be."

Googles 2k20 server status ""EA has decided to shut down all 2k20 servers effective 12/31/21""

The game was available for LESS THAN TWO YEARS and is now unplayable. But don't worry, you can still purchase it :)"
242,fuck this dogshit game got rid of offline mycareer
243,"suck balls tbh, wasted 200 bucks - like 2 years ago :("
244,Too bad it shut down. Anyway go follow my instagram.
245,This game is a waste of time.  You have to spend a LOT OF MONEY to have a chance.
246,at least mycareer have something to do compare with 2k21
247,its a scam
248,"im back
"
249,Servers are closed now so no point buying this game as you can barely do anything. Basically only quick play mode works. Shame they didn't even let you backup your player into personal computer or anything to continue playing. Would have kept a lot people from getting so angry. Horrible business conduct. Definitely last NBA 2k game I'll ever purchase. Leaves such a poor after taste being treated in such a manner. Wish there would be another company that could create quality NBA games.
250,still better than 2k21 and 2k22
251,"i love 2k 

"
252,"Absolute scam. Online servers shut down after the game has only been out for 2 years, making majority of the game unplayable."
253,nice
254,Very good game
255,meh i just love the game
256,"Money grabbing devs , don't recommend any game from them if you don't want to change it every 1 or 2 years"
257,"TL,DR: ***DO NOT BUY - AT ALL*** Severs shut down.

Classic 2K Money grab... The games barely 2 years old and 2K closed the servers down, meaning you've lost access to anything that required an online connection which is 80% of the game... MyCareer it is locked behind needing to be online.

2K At the very respectable expletive least... Removed the requirement for online only play, let us play MyCareer offline.
Unless I see a commitment to do this with future games once you think they are no longer financially viable, I along with thousands of others just won't be duped into supporting such disdain towards your player base. 

2K You should be ashamed of this practice. Cease the servers, stop updates, remove the requirement to be online.
-Prior to this, it was pretty good game... just developed by money hungry grubs. #Outraged"
258,was fun until everything was stripped from the game when the servers shut down. now it's just local play and the fucking barebones myleague it has. and it's still full price lmao. do not buy.
259,s
260,They killed the servers and the solo mode is not accessible anymore
261,Servers are dead my career is no longer playable way to go 2k you further prove you are all degenerates
262,"The game is still full price despite  the fact you cant use half the services. I cant access my player or my team because the servers are shut down. I have zero wish to play online but I cant no longer play my player because they shut the servers down. 
They want you to pay $60 plus dollars for a game where you can only quick play and run a league. Not only is this a horrible business practice it should be illegal and theft because once again the people that already got the game lost access to half of the game. I will be reporting 2K sports to the BBB. Do not buy any title from them its not worth it. They change nothing and ask full price years after the fact."
263,bad game
264,"
good game they took the servers down last year
"
265,GRAAAAAPPEE!!!!!!!
266,cant connect to nba2k
267,"Dont bother, servers closed. Nothing left to play. A pretty dick move by 2K."
268,this game is sht playing 10 mins per quarter then on the 4th in the last minute it will force close bitch game 2k
269,tough can't play
270,"It's dumb that mycareer is online and requires the servers that were just shut down. I've never engaged with a single online feature, I actively avoided everyone in the neighborhood and preferred to stay in the menus when I could, but my 175.5 hour long mycareer saves are still lost forever now that the server is down.

This franchise and company make a lot of bad, greedy, downright terrible decisions, but every 6 years or so they make a decent basketball sim. This was the first game since 2k14 that was decent. With the way 2k21 and 2k22 are it looks like the next decent game will be 2k26, but I'm not putting up with this crap again. I'm just glad I didn't pay full price for it.

So don't buy this game. Don't buy this franchise unless you want to buy every single year. I guess it is still better than EAnything."
271,"They turned off the Online Service so now you are not able to play most of the modes anymore! bunch of money leeching bastards at 2K. I honestly wouldnt buy either this game nor any of the games that are about to come out. 
In my opinion this specific game wasnt all that good either. The gameplay itself works and is definetly playable, but the animations, graphics and ""off court"" features (especially in myCareer) are unorganised, confusing and items are stupidly high priced. if you want to buy a shirt, cause you got sick of the regular stuff, you might have to play like 20 games to get there. Its stupid, they just want your actual money and they dont give a damn about their loyal fanbase. 
Disgusting in my eyes!"
272,idk why
273,"Yeah that's right I have 915 hours in the game. But I have no plan on getting 2k21 for the fact that we don't get the next gen treatment. Now that they shut down the servers I cant even play my career. All in all I rented this game, I do not own it. Thanks 2K!"
274,"A lot of people are hating on this game, but I've my fun with it. Now that they shut down the servers, I'm done playing it.
Definitely worth the 5 euros I spent on it."
275,WHERE'S My CAREER??????
276,"Its basically you rent this, its become unplayable when the server is down"
277,Game works when it wants to. Resetting the game doesn't help at all.
278,I receive error code 4B538E50 i cant find any solution on internet
279,Reinstalled this game thinking my files were corrupted. Turns out online mode is turned off and my character is no longer accessible.
280,"You can't play MyTeam or MyCareer anymore, only MyLeague or the Exhibition modes... Basically barely a game anymore unless you pay the yearly $60 subscription to the newest model. It's not that hard or expensive to keep the old servers up beyond 2 years, but EA is greedy and manipulative, forcing you to buy the latest and greatest version only. Classic EA"
281,2K are filth and intentionally broke their only decent gamemodes by switching off servers. Now the game is useless and your money is gone
282,har har
283,Fuck 2k and fuck this game. Mother fuckers nuked the game I paid for without notice killing the only game mode that I actually enjoyed. Fuck 2k. At least allow me to play my fucking game I paid for...even if you shut down your servers. Fuck You 2k. Fuck you in the ass till you die.
284,"I do not recommend this (if you want to buy the key outside steam) & any future 2K products
Shutting down online server after some period is okay, but disabling offline game mode is not

Now you can only play ""PlayNow"" modes which kinda like exhibition"
285,"Its 2K. It has tons of problems as everyone knows, but I still liked this game. I am just now reviewing it negatively because these guys are the most horrendous company I've ever fucking seen. They shut down 2K20 servers permanently which means no more access to the majority of the game. Enjoy the 5v5 Play Now for the rest of your lives folks :)

I will never buy another product by 2K again"
286,Good game if you catch it on sale. Full price is way to high.
287,the   s   h     i    t     2k
288,"Fun game

289,"3 years, they killed the game in 3 years. Locked every player out of most content of the game. Completely rubbish marketing scam"

291,f。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。k  垃圾
292,"Paid for a game which I can not play due to 2k shutting down the servers, no access to my career. It's actual theft as I can't play the full game anymore which I paid for."

294,f*ck
295,"This game is literally unplayable 
-Corrupted game saves
-Horrible microtransactions
-Nonworking online mode
-Offline Carrer mode isn't possible

This is trash on a stick resold with a new label"
296,2K GOBLOK
297,Can't play my career because of the server shutdown. Nobody understands why the f do we need the servers in order to keep playing some matches with our players. 2K keeps on disappointing
298,"they shut down the servers and pretty much every game mode is now unavailable. they could've at least made the single player modes offline but no, that would mean you wouldn't buy the new games so screw you and your game modes. do not buy this game or any other 2k game for that matter, the greedy bastards will just shut down the servers and you get nothing"
299,Doesn't allow to play My Career and My Team offline
300,so bad and not connected the internet
301,cant even play single player this is the worst thing ea has ever done.
302,"I am leaving a late review on this game to note to anyone who might see it still on sale that almost all relevant modes have been disabled. MyCareer, MyTeam and online modes no longer exist as of January 1, 2022. There is not enough remaining in this game to pay any amount of money for. Online play ceasing support at a certain point is understandable, but sabotaging multiple single player modes when the servers go down is a pretty heartless business practice. It is not currently for sale and probably won't be, but if they ever do ask money for this game in the future, do not buy, it is *NOT* a bargain because it doesn't work anymore."
303,👍
304,i keep having error code everytime i play
305,wish it had guns and was a little more like skyrim
306,"Got this as a gift that's why I moved on from 2K14. Guess what, that is a bad decision on my end. They mostly update things in-game and a simple note regarding shutting down the servers would be best for loyal gamers. But no, I just fired up the game and I can no longer access MyCareer mode which they tie up with needing to be online always. I'm done, will not get any more of their yearly CTRL C, CTRL V basketball game."
307,All the 2k games suck really bad. No point in spending money on trash.
308,fulfilled my dream of becoming a 7'3 center
309,"Really enjoyed this installment of the franchise, as I only play MyCareer. Sad to see today that I can no longer player it as it requires online support. This wasn't always the case with NBA 2K. Sucks."
310,"They just took the servers down, I had lost the ability to play my built, this is trash from now on"
311,"if you like basketball, then this is the game for you"
312,"1/5 of a game without servers, money leeching company..."
313,"These guys shut down the servers so I can never play MyCareer, MyTeam, onlined in any way.  Why you need to be online for MyCareer mode I have no idea.  At least let us play our existing characters offline.  Real scum.

DO NOT BUY."
314,If you don't play online there's not much new
315,this shits ass ngl but i still got 500 hours
316,always can't connect account
317,"what a nice game, goodbye 2k20"
318,cant play MC after server shutdown?? WTF
319,"Trash game from a trash company.  

They take the game away after a couple years so you will buy the new steaming pile of cow dung.  Do not fall for this.  It is a worse product that they will also take away.  

None of these clowns have every played basketball or ever care to.  

And stop trying to make Ronnie2k happen, it's not going to happen.  

If you absolutely have to have a basketball fix this game is at most $10 right after the NBA finals and usually $5 but beware they will absolutely take your product away after 2 years"
320,"Shut down Online play, even single player no longer works. Hello NBA Live"
321,if you only wanna play wit friends or mystory other than that its poopoopissfart
322,good
323,Fxxk U 2k!!! They fxxking shut down the sever
324,i cant to play online
325,"i was trying to figure out why i cant connect - i lost my online player - i usually like to play to de stress - but NOW THE SERVER IS CUT OFF. Dont buy -- I never knew they could do this

I logged just about 895 Hours of game play. I worked so hard making VC, creating my player and developing it - gathering myTeam rosters and auction house purchases  - NOW ALL GONE (TIME INVESTED IS GONE) -  if this is something they do to future nba 2k games then I have to boycott any sport games purchase from 2k.

This isnt a great look for its fan base."
326,What a trash company.  Just let me play my mycareer offline.  I spent 2 1/2 seasons slowly enjoying the game and it's just all gone now.
327,"i played just a little and servers cut off. What kind of a rip off this is? Even my career is unplayable. What is a point of buying a game that you can play just for some time? EA, next time show for how long the game you sell will be playable online, because i want my money back and im sure im not getting it back. I cant even imagine people that had put alot of money in to this game and it just shuts down just like that. Its just unfair"
328,"Eventually, 2K will cease access to their servers, without warning, and without creating any proper offline modes to continue to play the full product you purchased at full price. This actually amounts to fraud and theft of product (which you purchased), and 2K has gotten away with this over a long time. Just because you ""agreed"" to a EULA, does NOT make this behavior legal on their part-and only a judge in court can actually make that decision. So, Save your money for the lawyer you should hire with other 2K purchasers and bring a class action suit against 2K."
329,"Monopoly monkey business. Destroyed my single bit of respect to NBA. Good luck, see you when you will launch a single platform, but that will happen only when all the people will stop buying like me. STOP SUPPORTING"
330,Servers have been shut down. So no more point playing the game since game modes like Career Mode can't be played offline.
331,fix the server
332,"Just, fuck 2k!"
333,"The first NBA2k I have played. Came across an youtuber playing it. Started watching the sport because of it. Started following NBA closely because of it. Had a ton of fun playing offline mycareer, ignoring the bullshit throw your handup moments. As I write this review today, I cant play the mycareer mode anymore. The one mode that I played 1072 hours of. The game becomes utterly useless for me without my career. Basically, any 2k game has become like a 2 year rental game. It infuriates me on why the fuck the my career is even online. Have not bought 2k21 or 2k22 after 2K showed the middle finger to PC, that is not releasing next-gen for PC.   Now that my rant is over. The kicker was I had bought VC for a new build (first time as a post scorer) not realising the servers would be shutdown."
334,They Shut OFF online play..  CANT PLAY MY PLAYER!! DO NOT BUY!!

400,"Better than 2K21 for sure as the controls still make sense.
Good graphics, and player controls work well with an Xbox controller paired to the PC.

I will play this for another season as the trades still have a good even balance. 
In the new season (2022) basically every good player was traded to LA - not fun."
401,"Can only recommend this game at a steep discount (I bought it for $5). I only play MyCareer and finally got frustrated enough at the anti consumer practices + insanely long slow-mo bug that I uninstalled the game for good.

If you're looking to play any NBA2k game, it's literally a waste of your money unless it's $5-10"
402,w
403,"very good very fun
"
404,"Either too hard or too easy. 2k18 had a better balance. Set difficulty to Hall Of Fame makes it too hard but then tweeking the sliders to make it more balance does not work because this will make it too easy for some reason. Even adjusting by just 1 in player slider causes cpu players to play like rookies. The shooting is just awful, 99 3pt stat with multiple HOF outside shooting badges would make 3 out of 10 open shots. Ive only found 2 bugs, after challenging a foul and overturning it the camera will focus on the bench when it should focus on the jump ball causing a loss possession. The other is when passing in the inbound the ref would bug and just hold the ball, only way to get around this is to save and quit or call a time out. 2k has not fixed issues but they have been adding ridiculous feature which doesn't make the game fun at all."
405,"yes

"
441,"While NBA 2K games on PC are often looked seen as being pretty bad and poorly optimised, I did not mind this one. not only was this one of the better 2K's recently as long as you play with a controller it feels exactly like console. I would give it a 6/10, just fine not good but not bad either."
442,ok
443,Can't connect online most of the time
444,Dont buy NBA from 2K they always take my cerrear out of the game and it has oly bin about 2 years dont buy this games its a rip off

453,"Same game as the one I purchased 7 years ago. They never change, which is a gift and a curse. As I used to like these kinds of games. This brought me back to that time."
454,this game is very good to play
455,"Perfect Game. My only issue there are no roster updates for the current season.
You have yo buy the newest 2K version just to experience that.
The roster update in the Normal play should include all the later roster updates on the current season.


*****NOTE: All multiplayer servers for NBA 2K20 will be shutdown as of 12/31/2021. After that time, all game functions requiring online servers will no longer function.????????"
456,"enjoy
"
457,Seems Good game but When Reinstalled windows My Mycareer was completely gone. That makes me sad
458,noice
459,Very realistic game. If you play offline you can play a lot of different sets of offensive or defensive game.
460,"Don't shill for 2K by buying this game. They don't care about PC 2k, and they probably won't for a while.



It was only worth the $5 I spent."
461,ive never been into basketball but thanks to this game ive started watching
462,"good game
"
463,"This game is like playing the lottery. A lot of the moves don't work properly, controls are sloppy, animations glitch, shot calculations are basically a heavy sided coin flip against you. If you're just looking to try to have some fun and play a basketball game, don't do it. This is trash."
464,Thank you for the very nice experienced.
465,"Always the best NBA game but...
★★★★★★★★★☆

This opus is quite good, as usual with the NBA 2K series. But I can't hardly find any difference with NBA 2K19 or NBA 2K21. Graphics are quite excellent, sound effects nice and gameplay enjoyable - except there's quite a difference from a level of difficulty to another.

An effort has been made so that the career mode is more interesting and it is in my opinion.

I'd say if you're new to the NBA games, go for an NBA 2K game.
If you already own 2K19 avoid 2K20 and wait for... 2K22 ? Since 2K21 is roughly the same."
466,Good game
467,"best 2k
"
468,never been a good game
469,"I'd recommend this game to basketball fans with a couple caveats. One, it's not *that* different from previous years, in particular I don't think this is worth getting if you have 2k19 or maybe even 2k18. Two, I'd only ever play this solo against the AI, the online stuff is all kind of a mess with in-game purchases"
470,bad
471,Good game!
472,trashhhh
473,liked
474,game is great not that bad compared to the newer versions.
475,sussy obama amogus balls
476,"Para jugar solo esta buenisimo, incluso para jugar con otro jugador en local. 

El online, (en pc) esta bug, no funciona. Por lo cual, pierde la gracia comprar el juego"
477,-
478,very good gamee
479,w
480,Great game. Graphics are superb and life-like. Gameplay is smooth and realistic. Terrific all round.
481,"Entertaining! Does get grindy, but it gets kinda generous near end game when you can easily get GOAT level players in MyTeam."
482,This game is trash the developers have never played basketball as they are too morbidly obese. It's the only logical explanation as to how the game doesn't play like actual basketball.
483,Its better then 19.
484,"Meh, borring game"
485,"Your SINGLE PLAYER MyCareer game mode is forced to be online only. Guess what? When they shut down the 2k20 servers, this means you can no longer play your SINGLE PLAYER, STORY game mode. They haven't made any official announcement but it seems like they have started to. Tons of people commenting that they can't connect to the servers anymore."
486,trash
487,trash
488,bad
489,same as the rest
490,"It was a great game, played for the MyCareer and MyLeague. Never did any of the online gamemodes cuz of cheaters, but the singleplayer was the most fun I've had in a sports game."
491,ass
492,Very nice game! Love gameplay!
493,A learning curve at the start but put in the time and you'll soon be challenging the best
494,Game runs plays like shit with the characters moving like they are drunk. Even if you do everything right on defense the game finds a way to bring your score down. On offence a ball handler always loses the ball.
495,da baby
496,shit basketball the gaming and i hate it why i buy dont buy please
497,"First to say, NBA 2K20 was a major step down from the series. As a person who's first 2K game was 2K19, this game really nerfed shooting and limited the potential of the builds. Even if they created a new system for making your character, everyone always searches up on YouTube for the best builds for 2K20, so it doesn't even matter if you can now customize your build more since they're all mediocre at best except for the overpowered ones.

Second, they haven't fixed the FPS issues for Full screen and Full screen Windowed. When playing the game on MyCareer, I kept having my game go in slow motion during timeouts or simulations, and after browsing Reddit and seeing multiple people complain, there is no solution besides alt-tabbing your game which becomes an inconvenience. This game is not optimized for PC and without cross play, the population instantly dies when the new 2K comes out. 

Third, they made shooting a lot harder in 2K20. Without greening my shots, my full whites and ""Slightly Late"" never seem to go in despite my 95 Three and multiple HOF Shooting Badges. As a result, there's an influx of slashers and players who are either becoming finishers or big men. It was so bad they had to release patches that helped people make more shots in for shooters. In addition, the stretch build is basically non-existent because they reduced it so bad that it's not viable against other builds. I use to run a stretch in 2K19 and that build was able to shoot, grab rebounds, and become a perfect role as a rebounder and shooter. 

Fourth, you have to use the Quickdraw Badge to speedup your jumpshot which is the dumbest idea ever. Before in the previous games, you could customize your jumpshot speed to whatever you want, but now you have to spend 2-3 Shooting Badges to shoot reasonably fast. With shooters already being nerfed to if you don't green, you miss, this makes being a shooter build really terrible. Every time you miss with a full white, you feel so shit as a shooter and question if it's even worth making a build designed for shooting.

Here is some good things about the game. They have a whole new menu and make going to the Neighborhood much easier now. Also, you share your clothes you buy with all your builds, so you don't have to waste VC on buying clothes again and again. Lastly, the graphics look pretty good and they allow you to change your badges to what you want. Overall, don't waste money on this game if the next 2K game is already out. The only solution to saving this game and players is to add crossplay so you can at least play someone in park."
498,same game new year.
499,
500,Frustrated!
501,NIce Game to play some offline Career
502,I have a lot of hour but trust I only play this game because cause its the only realish basketball game on steam id rather play nba live
503,Would take my money and my 500 hours back if possible this game wack asf 🤣
504,"Game runs fine for 1 game then freezes and I cant alt tab anything, until I was able to pull task manager up on 2nd monitor and kill the program and I verified the integrity of the files and they're all there and fine. so Idk my PC is well above the requirements."

506,Absolute cancer. especially 2k customer service.
507,"GOOD GAMES GREATER MEMORIES :)))))))))))))))

510,"
Easy to play and easy to update rosters. Realistic."
511,better than 2k21
512,"It is cool if u are bored although online is not that good and idk why my comp made it super laggy 
"
513,good
514,"This game saved my life.

I am 31.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you!"
515,"great game
"
516,A bit of learning curve on shooting. Repition is the key to success on this one. Ball out players
517,I wasted way to much time on this game
518,i don't even play basketball
519,better than 21.
520,amazing game on pc
521,:)
522,"Everything in this game is designed in a way to tempt the player into buying VC. Which means if you don’t buy VC, you can expect to grind, grind, grind & grind some more if you want to improve your player. After playing this game, I’m pretty sure that 2K means that you either spend 2 grand to level up your player, or you spend 2 thousand hours leveling up your player. Uh… yeah… no thanks, not gonna happen. God 2K is a horrible, greedy, joke of a company. You’re better off going outside to play real basketball or even buying a nerf hoop, to hoop. I bought this game for around 5 bucks when it was on sale and I still feel ripped off. 0/10"
523,trash
524,I hate myself for playing this
525,its to laggy
526,"Bought it on sale. Please don't buy it full price, its not worth it."
527,good game
528,First nba game that i played. pretty good but not recommending this
529,2k19 was better
530,"No need to discuss the game or their distributor. It's not worth the breath. Just had to add here that in 2021 on my RTX 3060, this is the ONLY game that can't switch to the GPU. Not surprised but definitely validates all the neg comments. How's it possible that the entire team fell asleep at once?
"
531,This game is trash.
532,This game being $59.99 3 weeks before the launch of NBA2K22 is an insult to all gamers.

540,The Apple Arcade version of NBA 2K is the glaring example that you can have a fully functioning NBA 2K game without the f u c k i n g  obnoxious microtransactions.
541,"Realistic game, the best!"
542,"Bad Game.

Developer cares more about players wallets than the player. 
All games are the same and I don't think 2K care because it still sells.

The PC platform is also the worst way to play the game, because the developers don't care about the PC platform (because it sells less than console)"

546,ok
547,lebron flops = accurate to real life
548,"I can honestly say I cant recommend this. First the teammate grade is full of crap, and no matter where you shoot, if you miss, it’s penalizing you over “bad shot selection”. Teammates are stupid and almost never gave me the ball, and why am I paying 10,000 VC for custom shoes? This feels more like a cash grab anyways, because you have to spend VC to improve your overall. And why is my last name inappropriate?! That’s the stupidest thing I’ve seen all day, it makes me want to delete the game alone. I still prefer this over 2k21, because at least it still has more life than that game."

553,"I just hate this game.
the fact that when i installed this bigass game, it needed a download when i launched it like its some kind of mobile game.
And it probably took as long as the download. The menu is just the buggiest thing i have ever touched, no new keybinds i put get saved and i am forced to use the default garbage ones. This game deserves to be 10 bucks max"
554,The game was very well put together and had excellent game play. It also had a nice home page and great game features as well!

574,"If you're looking for a game to simulate playing in the NBA, this game is great. If you're looking for an online competitive game to grind, this game is not it. The MyCareer in this game is great. From the character creation to simulating NBA milestones, this game does that perfectly, and I love how fun it is. Getting to play for your favorite franchise alongside your favorite players is incredible to me, even if it's virtual. If you're looking to play this game as an NBA player simulator, this game is perfect."
575,Nice nice...
576,"Extremely broken, won't be buying any 2k games until they make a working version for PC."
577,Your server like shit ;)
578,How do you guys manage to make the games worse every year? Better than 2k21 but thats not saying much
579,"Although the game is ranked quite low on the all-time NBA 2K games rank, I quite like this one."
580,it suk
581,"""I use Linux as my operating system,"" I state proudly to the unkempt, bearded man. He swivels around in his desk chair with a devilish gleam in his eyes, ready to mansplain with extreme precision. ""Actually"", he says with a grin, ""Linux is just the kernel. You use GNU+Linux!' I don't miss a beat and reply with a smirk, ""I use Alpine, a distro that doesn't include the GNU Coreutils, or any other GNU code. It's Linux, but it's not GNU+Linux."" The smile quickly drops from the man's face. His body begins convulsing and he foams at the mouth and drops to the floor with a sickly thud. As he writhes around he screams ""I-IT WAS COMPILED WITH GCC! THAT MEANS IT'S STILL GNU!"" Coolly, I reply ""If windows were compiled with GCC, would that make it GNU?"" I interrupt his response with ""-and work is being made on the kernel to make it more compiler-agnostic. Even if you were correct, you won't be for long."" With a sickly wheeze, the last of the man's life is ejected from his body. He lies on the floor, cold and limp. I've womansplained him to death."
582,trash
583,"The pace of basketball is more thrilling than football as a video game. I am not very good at this game, but I do enjoy getting lost in it. The announcer soundbites do get on your nerves after hearing the same thing for 75 games, and the cost of player cards is insane as everyone went on to the next version. Fun is hard to find in video games these days, this game has just that! I still get excited when I get a great steal, rebound, block, slam-dunk, 3 point shot or pass each and every time. Go Bucks!"
584,It's better than nba 2k19
585,this game is just trash
586,on pc with mods this game is amazing

588,More better than 2k21 !!!!
589,awful
590,Baskemtball
591,"It's fun to me, the only bad thing I can say about it is the shooting is a bit too difficult and trying to find a match in the neighborhood is almost impossible."
592,"They charge $59.99 for a year old 2k and all other 2ks, but run a sale on 2k21 all year. 

Like 2k17, 2k18 and 2k19 servers are shut off and they charge $59.99 for all 3! 

2K is just a greedy company! 
"
593,"i like it
"
594,yes
595,"Game sucks. I only play this game because I'm a basketball fan and enjoy the NBA. I think the only good thing about this game is ""My League"" because this mode doesn't demand money to be slightly fun. Basically, I hope a new basketball game drops to compete with the insufferable developers that made this garbage."

610,greedy manipulative devs and they're making money off Kobe's death
611,I don't understand how they could make an NBA game feel like a game made by people that have only been told the rules of basketball and have never seen people move. 2K have put so many small breaks in the game play in MyCareer to force you to see more advertisements and to wast your time to try and get you to spend real money to try and improve your player at a speed that might be reasonable.
612,"I.... 
..I lost so much of my life... 
..Why?!?!...
..Why did I start a MyTeam?!?!... 
*sobs heavily and curls into the fetal position*"
613,You paid for the game and yet they limit you with what you can do to MyCareer. They only give you a one sided player. Either you are good with offense but bad with defense or the other way around. You really can't grind your player to be good at both. And yet they still wonder why there are so many cheaters out there. What a bunch of retards.

622,Honestly fun until the end. Was addicted to MyTeam for a long time.
623,"Sucks... Thought it will be better than 2k16 but its not... waste of money since the badge has its limit so u can't unlocked all of them to the gold one... poor game, the stat on myplayer is also sucks,"
624,bad game
625,"Game is decent enough if you can get past the initial grind of badges and VC. You dont need to be a diehard basketball fan to enjoy this game but it certainly helps.

100% recommend this game only when it goes on a big sale. 

Wish we had 2k21 next-gen but 2k apparently hates us lol"

627,Like
628,nice fun game and all some bugs but higly recomended!!!
629,"i'm someone who don't play online and I would like a MYCAREER where you could create the perfect player and have fun and more difficult MYGM/MYLEAGUE but of course 2K don't care about that.
And it's same game as last year of course.
"
630,"I don't have much to say as I'm not a massive basketball fan and haven't played enough bb games for comparison. Graphics are good, UI is good, game-play seems pretty solid. The My Career mode is a nice little cinematic story, but drags on a wee bit much.

If you're a fan of the sport, its good to go. Maybe on sale. If you're not a fan, it's a hard sell."

655,"Ok, the ""playability"" its decent. Lack of depth hurts my buttocks. But seriously, 100giga+ of storage for this crap? Should be less then 30 percent of that, when they make a ""lite"" version I will be interested again. I can watch commercials for free on youtube."
656,game is actually fun
657,"This game is easy to learn, hard to master. also free kobe is nice....

Hi 2k please pretty please bring me back to 4th quarter in the playoffs game 3, 171 Pelicans, 104 Rockets, and i have 111 points, 7 rebounds, 10 assists, 1 block, 6 steals, FGM 50/FGA 63, FTM 11/ FTA 13, 3PM 0/ 3PA 0, 35 min, 2 turnovers, 3 fouls and there was 3:50 left on the clock. Also Favors be going crazy while Zion is injuired.


(edit) bring back the servers i need to finish my career or please let us play my career offline, do the same for 21 and the rest of ur games."
658,ball is life but 2k isnt
659,daddy
660,"If you got this game for free, its fine. If you got this game hoping for an improvement over previous titles, I feel very bad for you. 
The 2k series is a wasteful cash grab. Do not support these devs releasing game after game with no real new features that players want. Hard pass.
Unless you got it free."
661,
662,"is worth 60$? no way. is buggy? yes. Is solid basketball game? yes
unfortunately its the only real bball game like it but its still decent but yeah only get if on sale"
663,yes
664,"A cash grab. Never saves my progress in MyLeague. Every time i try to manually save when i relaunch the game the save is gone? Even when it ""auto saves"" it doesn't save."
665,nice
666,"I've played virtually all the NBA2k games, my hours played speaks for itself... clearly I enjoy playing it. I typically only play My Player as a PG and try to just pick n roll/assist

As far as 2K games go, this is the best of the series. Haven't tried 2k21 and wont until a 20$ deal hits. The story in this game is a bit long, a lot of times i just skip through it as to me this is more like a sports rpg where you build your stats by playing/practicing.

The only major bug I've encountered was due to increasing frame rate past 60hz, as long as you leave it there game plays smoothly

If you're looking to jump into any NBA2k game for the first time I would definitely recommend this game."
667,I played this game for my career and it's been good compare to 2k21 without cutscenes LOL
668,good
669,Better than 2k21
670,its alr
671,This game sucks!
672,Hahaha. Go suck my dick with this shitty game. Don't buy this shit
673,theres no way the people who developed this game brag about it
674,"One of the worst games I've ever played tbh. The AI is completely worthless, your team mates will consistently make the most brain dead decision I have ever seen in my entire life, the opponent AI will just torch you no matter what. Star players just do whatever the hell they want whenever they feel like with no chance of stopping them. 
VC rates per game are stupid low, the grind is absolutely real and absolutely horrible if you don't want to pay for VC.
Controls are sluggish, at least in my career which is the game mode I'm most interested in, it feels like your character is running through water. Lateral movements are a joke, you move about as fast as a 2nd grade child with 2 broken legs.
The graphics are ok, if you only look at the players. The fans in the stands, the coaches, the security guys standing in the tunnel, Ernie, Kenny, and Shaq, they all look fucking horrible.
This game is shit, don't waste your money even if its on sale. I'd rather play 400 hours of fucking garfield kart"
675,"One of the best & my favorite 2k version of all time - the shot meter and mechanics on this version is extremely fun and well-made. One of the best versions in recent years, in a great time in NBA history.

689,"the amount of hours that have been put into this game is an embarrassment. its the same feeling as watching too much tv but the tv show is only bobs burgers. this game is an absolute disaster. if i had a penny for every bug ive experienced in this game, i still wouldnt buy this game even if its on sale for 100% off. big time waster. constructively, the bugs make the game unplayable unless restarted or waited out for 5 minutes. 

the only good things about this game come from the little splash of dopamine that you get when you score a basket or win a game. I cant lie, those moments where theres a minute left and every possession matters are unbeatable. however, the rest of this game is absolutely disgusting. would not recommend this game"
690,Crashed twice in a row just now. This is not irregular. I only bought this because it was on sale a while ago

728,"got for $5, same as the others"
729,"I'm uninstalling this one for my own sanity. If you are playing against friends, then you can disregard this review, but the AI sucks all of the fun out the experience. At times it feels like a switch has been flipped and the game has just decided that the AI will start making every shot and the player will start missing every shot. It wasn't a one time , now I'm salty experience either. I'd start to improve my skills, level out the score, and all of sudden the other team becomes supernatural. Coverage doesn't matter. Distance doesn't matter. They hit. You miss. An even game goes on a 12-2 swing. For the older crowd, it's like playing hard AI in old fighting games. It isn't 'good' ; it's just cheap."

740,It was well worth the $5 I paid for it. But most sports games are not worth paying full price for because they are usually just copy+paste versions of the previous year's game.
741,"Horrible game. Bugs and glitches galore, and not a realistic sports game, even by 2k standards. I recently encountered a bug which prevented me from moving my player, which gives you an idea of how trash the game is. If you're looking for a 2k game, I recommend 2k16, but whatever you do, don't buy this one."
742,"What's everyone complaining about? Could things be better? Sure. But that doesn't really discount that it's a great game, with controls that are functional. Just wish people would stop posting porn on the custom features submission bit."
743,"I had intended to play this for quite a while longer before deciding on a review, but my single player offline game just ""Expired"" for not being online. I was uncomfortable enough when I needed to give them an email... and still they deleted my offline content? We'll see if I care enough to start over after putting this up.

Now for judging on the content itself. Up front, I'm not a sports-baller and I only check in on a series every few years. So all of my opinions come from that of a filthy casual.

- - -
Core Gameplay:
The basketball itself is well implemented so long as you understand this is a basketball simulation, not arcade. When I started it was ""Foul Simulator 2020"" because I tried to do stuff, but this is a passive game. Stealing, sprinting, defending all have a high chance of fouling and it's often safe to just stay close to reduce the opponents shot%. 

Technically, you have alot of options ranging from different shot types to waving your arms around but as a casual it's an overwhelming experience. The training I played was basically useless as it lists a move and the button combo but doesn't even tell me if I did it right or how it was meant to be used. I was surprised that there weren't options to reduce the complexity.

But when I got the hang of it, the game does feel really good. Alot of the game is hidden random rolls, but your actions can modify the percentages. Once you get a feel for the situations that aid or hurt your chances you start feeling a real sense of control over the court. 

- - -
Metagaming:
There are 3 distinct modes that all play and feel different. These are worth breaking up
- - -
Player mode:
Most of my play was focused on the ""MyCareer"" story mode where you focus on playing a single college player trying to get drafted. I managed to complete the main storyline before the delete.

It's a fairly interesting story that tries to ask the questions of ""Play ball or be politically active"" and ""Play ball or get the movie deals"" but ultimately... its all just talk. The only interesting poltical move is in the first five minute of play and the rest of the story keeps promising bigger things but it just didn't. 

(It was actually a pretty funny story if you're a crap baller like me and maybe even politically relevant.  ""Don't let it get you down. We know they didn't hire you because of politics!"" after I just pulled off a C- player rating. No dudes, this ain't politics, I just suck!)

The focus in this mode is on a ""Teamwork"" rating which represents how selfishly you play the game and how well you shift the blame onto your teammates. This isn't a joke: 
- Winning and losing the games in the story doesn't actually matter.
- If you score or assist you get points... but if you run interference so a teammate scores you get nothing. 
- If the guy you are assigned to defend scores, you lose points. If you let him pass the ball so that someone else scores, no penalty for you!

The concept of focusing on your job is great, but its a system you need to game. When it works, you feel like you're part of a team but too little gain comes from any group success. You're best bet is to play selfish.

Despite the silliness of the system this entire mode feels pretty good to play. As a mediocre player I felt the struggles of trying of get noticed and I was pretty invested. You get to live out a underdog story and overall I had a blast with it.

There is one thematic disconnect I'll talk about later with the microtransactions and character growth.

- - -
GM Mode:
The GM mode is the other point I spent decent time with and it allows you to focus on running a team from a business and relationship standpoint. It's a surprisingly character focused though I don't know if I'd say this as a good thing.

Characters will offer you objectives and you gain respect for succeeding at them. This can be making money, filling seats regardless of profit, building team synergy, winning games, raising stats etc. It's a good variety of interesting goals. Do good and people like you more, do bad and you'll make enemies.

But actually playing the mode felt pretty awkward at times. 

If I ""Chit Chat"" with a player to boost his morale I need to watch through random conversations. I'm talking movie reviews, decorating tips, inviting myself on their private trips.  It both wasted alot of my time and made me feel very uncomfortable at the same time. 

GM me is really cringey!

Alot of the time I spent here, I honestly wished for static menus and less polish. But overall, it seems like there is plenty of interesting aspects to this mode and I'm curious to play more.

- - -
Team Mode:
Finally there is a team mode. I know nothing about this mode because they, you know, expired my single player game before I got into it.

- - -
DLC / Progression:
It's a really weird experience overall because the story mode narrative all tries to say ""It's bigger than the game. Your morals and your voice matter."" but mechanically this is a game all-in for capitalism. The dialog that talks about the importance of a bigger TV is more meaningful to the virtual world you live in.

To grow as a player you need money. Money buys success. Both in game, and microtransaction-y.  

As a gameplay loop it mostly works but it makes the rest of the narrative feel wrong. They made a political statement while actively proving their own words wrong. 

Combine this with video cutscenes like where they're 2K hosts tell me ""You're about to use the character and it's really good. I had so much fun with this part of the game."" and it feels really corporate. This entire experience just feels wrong.

- - -
Final Thoughts: 
Outside the screw you delete, I have mixed feelings for this game. It is 100% micro-transaction focused and overall a fairly shallow experience. 

But I bought it on a pretty deep sale and don't regret the purchase. There's fun to be had and the basketball is well done."
744,Filled with micro transactions. Not worth it unless you get it for free or MAYBE under 5 dollars.
745,"Horrible optimization, they took the worst stuff from 2k19 that every player complained about and made them worse. Overall a disgraceful effort to put out a game just because they have to do it every year. Horrible."
746,pretty fun
747,"terrible optimization. didn't even get to play the game, even main menu wasn't working smoothly"
748,same game for the last 10 years. Still cant skip like 90% of the trash cutscenes. why would you consider buying this for more that 5 dollars.
749,too many hackers in MyPark
750,Garbage. I was playing MyPlayer and got him all the way to 88 when I logged in 1 day to find that 2K just deleted my account even though it was verified or whatever it was that they were looking for. I lost 10 hours of progress for no reason.
751,"NBA 2KXX are the best  NBA-basketball games out there.
Controls are easy and work well with both a controller and a keyboard, but if you want to play better and feel more control I would rather pick a controller. Graphics are great and surpass my expectations. The only problem with them is that the models often go through eachother and look fairly confusing.
Other than MyCareer and ""pickup"" games there is a multiplayer, MyLeague - in my opinion this mode is made the best of all of these that 2K20 contains. The game is highly compatible with both new and old computers and even simulating does not limit the computer very much.
If only there were any other up-to-date/new NBA-basketball games we could have a comparison, but right now 2K20 and 2K21 are the best basketball games made so far.
Enjoy!"
752,"       pc端的2k我只玩过这一款，以前只玩过手机版的，所以就我个人而言还是挺不错的游戏（至少比21好），虽然有偶尔的闪退.掉线.公园卡顿，但也不得不承认，是一款很不错的游戏，除了这个机制比较... ...刷vc会封号，但是公园里的长臂猿完全没人管，各种肉眼可见的‘天赋’，使用自己也比较倾向于辉煌生涯，看着一如既往的总冠军感言，玩多了就少了很多的激情，不过通过修改器更改面补.数值以后重现各个巨星曾经的辉煌王朝，也是一个非常不错的选择，在多人联机方面有一点也是非常方便的，只需要有一个游戏手柄，就能一个手柄一个键盘，和小伙伴一起愉快的玩耍。
       现在我也只是一个才刚快要玩到两百小时的玩家，很多都没有去尝试过，所以喜欢的小伙伴欢迎到某宝看看，毕竟便宜一些，而且最近e宝的21免费送，没有的朋友可以先去尝试一下。"
753,This joint bussin
754,buy this game trust me
755,i dont play online. just hof cpu. fun
756,"I'd venture to say I've put in more MyLeague time than most.  It's the only mode I play, so understand the review reflects such.  While there are a few head-scratching bugs that should have never made release, I've yet to find any that are game breaking.  It'd be nice if the mentor system actually worked, but you can edit your way around it.  It's a game that has years of refinement and a system that has been quite polished at this point.  I wish there was a way to separate the game from the developer, as 2k has turned into little more than a EA clone when it comes to their sports games.  Repackage last years, include a billion ways to monetize it via microtransaction, and ignore even basic bug fixes.   I really hate the bullshit monopolies these companies hold over us in the sporting game genre."

Also as expected now the servers for 2k20 are down and one can not start a new my carreer mode online and have all the features that online mycarreer mode has offered. i never cared about mypark and stuff since there are tons of cheaters but only reason i played this game was MyCarreer mode and for that reason i will never buy another NBA 2k game."

This port is basically for people who pretty much only play my league and are tired and annoyed of how long it takes to sim a season on any of the consoles. (my experience is from old gen.) Additionally if you want to make this game look better (again for my league and such offline activities) this game could be fine.
Any NBA2K game should only be bought in a severe discount, and thats my two cents.

TL;DR- dont buy, only buy for my league content, modding is decent. only buy discounted severely."

846,"It's a fun game -- when it works -- but is basically unplayable because of the same daggum ""error"" I get whenever I go to use the ""practice facility."" While it will load once in a while (the game on MyCareer) once in a while, it will consistently crash when I try to go to the Practice Facility...it'll let me go 2-3 times, but then sometime whenever the game decides it doesn't feel like starting up under ""MyCareer"" mode, I'll have to sometimes wait WEEKS for it to load again.

I've spent too much time on a build for me not to be able to PLAY it for weeks on end. I've been back and forth with 2k customer support and they want me to go rooting around inside MY machine, digging into the OS, doing this, doing that, none of it ever working...the problem is QUITE obviously on the DEVELOPERS end, as they can't created a consistent interface with the Practice Facility that doesn't keep crashing the game and keeping it crashed for long swaths of time in a row. 

After MONTHS (starting last October continuing until yesterday, when they told me they can't refund VC to try on another build to see if it's the build itself that has some error or not, and I see 2k21's reviews are even worse, so I cannot recommend this game at all. It's VERY frustrating to invest so much time into it not knowing if it's gonna crash, and knowing when it does, it's often weeks before it'll decide to load again.

It is the ONLY game I have such issues with, so I know the trouble isn't on my end, despite what customer service would have me believe. I've spent more time troubleshooting than I have playing! 

So...I'll have to just ignore 2ksports over this franchise at least until such point where others have played a while and aren't getting all these error codes to deal with. It's not fair to us players who put up money in good faith only to be told we wasted it along with our time since they won't transfer what represents a lot of time and effort put into a build that crashes all the time.

Great game concept -- LOUSY execution.

Scoring is atrocious! A seven foot center in the NBA with a 90+ rating doesn't miss a five foot uncontested lay-up. The lack of team mate defense is laughable. I'd ask for a refund, but I would be embarrassed to admit I bought this junk. I admit  the game is pretty, but the game play sucks! Buy something else!"

1 lagging/losing frames 

2 seeing players in the park competing with relatively savvier mods and cheats, thought i saw a lot of green players team up to beat em but you have to join a community to do so or chances are you loses most of the games and hv Ls on record and ppl don't play with you (the logic is lost cuz 2K don't split up the elites and noobs by levels, only has fame and park levels that put all of the players in one cage)

3 2K doesn't give a shit about your gaming experience as you have to buy VCs to get a MC player built up to a basic level and then you are just getting started at 85 ability and see if your build is a good or bad (If you try it out yourself you will find a great chance to see greater builds on court and there's little room for you experimenting with the builds since you already paid to get this build to 85) (then you have to watch Youtube vids to compare builds cuz that way you won't risk it)

One thing I dislike is that legend is locked behind online play. With how badges work in this game, online seems kind of... not fun. Then you have me as a more casual player not wanting to play against sweaties. I think attributes should be boosted and badges completely negated in online to be fair. Online should give increased rep and progression, but nothing should be locked behind online. Hopefully they change this and make online not only better for online players, but also for offline players."

As soon as nba live comes back ill uninstall 2k20, not wasting money on 2k21 for the same game only worse..  Every part of the 2k20 is terrible, from the modder infested parks,  the horrific shot meter that pretty much plays no role in whether you make or miss a shot nor does shot selection matter. The pre determined outcomes in the game are just stupid along with computer pre determined made shots over triple teams (the computer scoring runs are out of this world) And I REALLY WISH theyd bring back playing online vs other players in an actual nba arena with real teams and a ranking system, and full control of all 5 players on the court not just the created player your forced to play with. I miss having control of the entire team and roster in dynasty.. On this game once you pass the ball you computer does there own thing.. Like i said im just waiting for any other somewhat realistic nba game to drop and bye bye 2k..  Crazy how 2k continuously ignores their customers year after year! At this point they should just release a nba 2k11ish game play with updated rosters and then build from there in the future... People would buy it and be so much more satisfied with the game. JUST MAKE A DESCENT PACED BASKETBALL GAME WITH A REALISTIC SHOT SELECTION! Stop with the unnecessary changes that are killing this franchise! BRING IT BACK TO THE 2k10 2k11 days!"

1036,MyCareer is way too grindy especially in the rookie season. After your rookie season you get paid much more per-game but by this point a lot of the game loses interest when you have spent over 200 hours in a rookie season of mycareer. All the other game modes are recycled trash from previous versions of NBA2K. Every year 2k descends down the microtransaction rabbithole and it's very apparent the game is designed for profit rather than enjoyment of the player. Wouldn't recommend unless on sale and your willing to drop some dollars.

1059,"The MyCareer story is laughable hot garbage, its a tiny poorly written movie, where you're geared up to be this big college name. Guess what? You're not, you're hot rhino shit mixed in with a bag of old stale Pringles, yea taste that. How is a player rated 60-63 TEAM CAPTAIN of what I presume is a D1 college basketball program, HOW?! And how is it possible for someone who sucks as much as our starting players able to get drafted? How are you suppose to make any headway at becoming good? Here's how:

BUY VC

That's it. Trade that oh so valuable medium of exchange that can buy you food or ACTUAL entertainment. Now maybe you're asking, if I poured so many hours into this game playing MyCareer, I have to be one of these morons that wasted their money. NOPE, to effectively enjoy myself, I hacked the FUCK out this game. I stay away from multiplayer because that isn't fair, but to have any semblance of fun in NBA2k20, just find a trainer, seriously. 

2k has pushed the fact that they have monopolized the basketball video game industry to this point. You want you're player to play like a competent NBA basketball player? Pay us. You want to customize your suits, and playground gear? Pay us. You want to get some sneakers that maybe individualizes you? Pay us. You want to max out your attributes, set within a category you cannot break free from? Hey, fuck you, you're asking to much. You want to play in the Rec center? Oh did you change your mind, because no one's showing up? Fuck you, you're stuck here until you alt-tab out and quit the window. You want to scan your face into the game? Eh we barely worked on the functionality of it, so good luck trying to get it to work and when you do, don't be surprised when you look like an even more fucked up version of Quasimodo.

Play with NBA players who ALL look like their souls were stolen. Dead eyes and dead faces grimace, scream and smile horrifically. They look nowhere and at the same time look deep within your soul to somehow try and steal yours, I am not kidding here. As good as the players look, every single one of their faces remind me of what a body would look like in a casket on display with their eyes open. Now add to the fact these things move. 

The animations lock you in, there is no finesse in your player. If basketball was ever played like this, you might as well call it American football. You try to run a motion, or a screen you'll find yourself STICKING to players, screaming to remove yourself from their gravitational pull. Every single one of them. The AI can pull off crossovers effortlessly, try to have your 63 rated NBA (NBA is big league if you don't know) player do the same thing, go ahead and try. Loose ball.

Visual Concepts failed completely on the side of function and mechanics in this game. Why aren't our players rated at least 65 in college? How is a NBA draft contender playing worse than a 15 year old? How is it, with a 93 overall rating, my player (without any hacks or cheats enabled) is NOT able to sink an open 3 pointer? 

I'm rambling sorry.

Why is Idris Elba not my coach in the regular season? Where is Rosario Dawson throughout my career, what about Porter, dude never texts me or calls me or hits me up on 2kTwitter. This game tries to build the experience and illusion of you being a NBA player, but fuck me does it fail. You think you're at an oasis ready to drink water and BOOM the mirage disappears and your hand deep in camel shit about to bring it to your mouth to drink. And the voice actor for Che, God have mercy, I see after hiring Idris and Rosario, ya'll hit the bottom on funding and had to pull whoever this dude is. 

Why did I meet Lebron James when I got drafted? I was drafted to the bum ass Knicks and Lebron greets me into the league? What?!

I'm rambling again.

I don't have many days where I can go out and hoop around anymore, wish I could, I thought this would give some sort of semblance of hooping and maybe a taste of what NBA players may go through in their careers. Nah, what we are essentially given is (from the standpoint of playing MyCareer) is a fucking terrible movie and realization you spent money on this.

THERE'S A WNBA MODE?! WHY?!"

THIS FRANCHISE IS A JOKE!

besides the fact its garbage as fuck on pc 

pros
- great graphics 
- amazing nba player model detail
- good mygm 
- good myleague
-------------------------------------------------------
Cons
-Bad dribbling
- Bad defense
- awful balance of offense and shooting
- pay2win myteam
- awfully boring grind if you do NOT want to pay
- SHIT mycareer story along with a garbage  park/hood/playground, w.e
- horrible AI, the  artificial intelligence is high tier garbage and has been the same since 2k8
- Animations we still see from 2011
- bugs we still see from 2k11
- half-assed dunk contest that has not been updated since 2k13
- absolute trash laggy 3 point contest since 2k13
- scripted animations where you are forced to get dunked on or unable to defend it
- pick n roll cheese that is  abused
- over-done advertisement in mycareer or any game mode
- working out in a gym to get boosts? they are BAD and you should feel bad for putting that unfun shit in the game
- glitchy basketball that goes through players, so you cant steal the ball
- pro-am buggy lag always kicked out
- multiplayer is laggy as hell(THATS SAD FOR A BILLIONAIRE COMPANY)

This game is  humiliating and is worst then fifa, madden, nba live, nhl, baseball, theres nothing i can say thats worst then this triple AAA game its  laughable.

1140,"I mean, not much to complain about. Sometimes gameplay feels rigged and scripted, other times its really good. I read a lot of complaints about this game especially on PC, but I honestly didnt experience many bugs or glitches or freezing. Optimization is really meh for PC but nothing a few tweaks you do yourself  cant handle and you'll be grand. Apart from that, same game as the last year, and the next year. Cant complain."
1141,"Very bad game. Graphic is worse than a 2010 game from ps2 and its much worse on the game play part as the movements of players are very limited and so much bugs.

The passing is so bad that there are no common sense involved. I scored 45 points a game and only got A- whereas a mistake will cost you to downgrade. You dont get grades if you block/rebound as a center, and if you score from the post you dont get any grades too, only vc, which is like 2 coins, I mean if you score, meh, useless, its not important to score, its much more important to fucking do something else but scoring. Absolutely unable to double team or guard the rim without losing points from ""leaving assignment"", I mean seriously, defending the rim is also an assignment and not only guarding your man 1v1. Oh also, post moves takes forever. 

The pre match shows and animations for free throws takes FUCKING 10 MINUTES. So much errors and illogical nonsense. This game has to be voted one of the worse game ever made ever, absolutely no thought process and effort whatsoever. 

I FUCKING SWEAR THIS GAME IS FUCKING SHIT, UNBELIEVABLE DONT BUY!!"
1142,basketball
1143,why is it every time I select the difficulty level of Superstar or Hall of fame opposing team hits a two pointer will be scored as 3?????? And why is it that I can't use a intentional foul during crucial possessions????????????????
1144,if you just dont touch the park with the super overpowered 95 overalls with 800 foot wingspans that catch every rebound and shoot everything than its a great game
1145,Dont buy it its shit
1146,"I've always, always played 2K on console. It has changed me since playing it on PC. Mods take this game to a different level just in terms of realism and customisation.

It's a shame to say though that even mods cannot affect how the game feels and although sliders can help fix the stickyness of players, shooting tendencies, defensive help etc. it still doesn't help change the fundamental BASKETBALL flaws with this game. Spacing is bad, passing is horrendous in certain situations, defense is very much undervalued by developers. All things that 2K never seem to address even when it's been staring them in the face. Still a decent game and scratches the itch."

1229,"The player attributes do not correspond with their playing ability. It almost seems the games forces results by arbitrarily changing players ratios. Its a very frustrating experience to develop your game, read guides, work in 2KU and realize that your success playing the game depends mostly on luck and not skill. Its still fun to see and do some of the moves on the game against a friend but I don't understand how can their be a legit competition in such a flawed game."
1230,Good game.

1234,If you're looking to find a fun singleplayer experience you have that in MyLeague and MyGM. Both game modes have tons of stuff to offer. You will not find it in MyPlayer though as that game mode is some pay to win garbage with a terrible story line. MyTeam is also nothing that i myself have dabbled with. I will recommend the singleplayer but stay away from the multiplayer

1252,"Really fun game but ruined by monetization. I pity the fool who paid more than $10 on this. I also pity the devs for their hardwork and legacy being ruined by the suits who demanded monetization level to this degree.

Without the monetization, easy recommend 10/10. The amount of work/effort put in here to recreate the atmosphere and feel of the court is astounding.

The way it is though, 3/10. You got to pay again and again to truly enjoy the game. This is no longer a game, its a money spending software application psychologically designed to manipulate and make you feel good while spending your hard earned dollars in ""Game"".

If you've already owned past entry to this franchise, please don't buy it. It's just a copy and paste renaming of the game."

1265,"Pay To Win Everything just about money ,first this game is so expensive ,second PayToWin ,Third there's no different with 2k19 just,only only a small part has changed in terms of the game there is no change, the difference is only from, the players and the stadium, the story in MC mode and the new dunk action, so far as long as I play this game it's open I'm happy but instead it's boring if in the next nba 2k 21,22,23,24 and so on like this, 2k there is one message that I want to convey, it is missing the concept of pay to win and create a new event in it because if you have put a high price on this game, isn't it the same thing that we got but a revolutionary thing:)"
1266,"great game, I love how the leagues don't freeze randomly. Thanks Ronnie :) <3."
1267,"Since I couldn't play actual basketball due to the pandemic, this shiz keeping me company."

1269,"It is beyond me, how a game in 2020 can have graphics from 2015, AI from 2012 and the only thing they added since 2010 is micro transactions and crap cutscenes. Just the concept alone of not making this game for the glorious PC master race in the first place is a crime against humanity

"
1270,"NBA 2k was one of those games where you have to play if you like watching basketball in general. I got the game on a discount right after 2k21 was dropped. I wouldn't recommend paying full price for any 2k games because the prices seems overprice. As a new player I was expecting a semi-realistic experience to the NBA but I was wrong, the game is difficult to get a grasp on. And when playing mycareer it takes ages to level your character's OVR unless you go the route where some players go, which is pay for VC. The prices seems overprice and the game feels incomplete. You'd imagine NBA 2k to be a great game based on its prices but you guess wrong. And the game are sold separately which feels like a scam, and only a couple of new things to the new NBA 2k games. I feel like 2k focuses more on how things looks rather than prioritizing the gameplay. I don't understand why they don't just give the game its own client and just update the game rather than making and selling a new one. Financially, I have no clue but based on its prices I expect the games to at least have good reviews but currently NBA 2k21 got negative ratings especially from the PC community."

1272,Trash filled with hackers but I'm addicted
1273,"Please stop buying NBA2K games. I'm 100% confident this review will apply to the next 10 NBA2K games, because they're the same regurgitated garbage. Got more ""ka-ching"" sounds than a Las Vegas casino jackpot. The reason I write this review so late is because 2K21 is on sale for $20 right now. I checked out gameplay and couldn't believe that I was looking at the same game I have owned for over a year. Anyone who's giving this positive reviews are family/friends of the devs (assuming they have friends), consuming glue, or they'll doing some serious trolling."

1281,"It's no different from any of the other NBA2K games you've played. Very little has changed, you're going to be grinding in MyCareer, MyTeam, etc unless you're willing to shell out extra bucks for microtransactions, which is obviously the goal. If you've got 2K18 or 2K19, don't bother with 2K20 or 2K21. Just download the updated rosters and enjoy your life."

After the story ended I was not able to play my first 2 pro games and I was not able to skip through it without losing credit for the game. The 3rd game failed to Sim to next appearance as well so I quit the game and now I am writing this review. I already wasted 40 minutes watching 2 games that I was unable to play for some reason and i'm not wasting another 20 minutes to see if i'm able to play the 3rd game. I would not recommend this game to anybody and I wish I can get my money back. Just wasted my time..

EDIT: I played 11 hours more because i really wanted to play this game. Some games doesnt let you Sim through to next appearance and if you do sim through it you might lose. I still wont recommend this game. ill give it a solid 5\10."

Not playing, or trading or building a team, but go through the same redundant 10-15 conversations over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over, next week, and over and over and over, next week, and over and over. . . No big ill just go back to 2k19. . . OH YEAH THATS RIGHT you cant cause 2k are a bunch of greedy POS's. Every year I bitch about how much of a rigged pay to still get cheated shitfest this game is, and still i buy it to get the newest rosters and player animations/modles. But if I cant control the only enjoyable part of the game without enduring hours apon hours of endless dialog im done"

1366,This game sucks ass
1367,"Often just doesn't work. Ok basketball sim when it does, but you will need to put in 20ish bucks into the Virtual Currency just to make the career mode viable. Get the game on sale for ~5 bucks and put 20 into it and it's reasonable, so long as it actually works."
1368,It's a basketball game and if you don't already have one and wanted one then it's great!  Always better to wait till these games are on special though.
1369,Game doesn't even work. I've tried reinstalling and verifying the game files. When you launch the game it's just stuck at 0% while trying to download game updates.
1370,very
1371,"Honestly not worth buying! All the effort has been put into 2KTV instead of the actual game-play. I wouldn't mind if they allowed you to play the MyCareer mode offline but that is not an option as you have to watch the 2KTV episodes and spend money to actually get anything you would actually like. Also along with the only mods or patches being the addition of new Packs in the MYTeam mode there has been absolutely nothing done by the developers to improve the gameplay and fix bugs within the system. Also having nerffed the MyPlayer creation to not allow for the creation of the next MJ, Wilt, LBJ or Magic removes the entire point of having bought this game."
1372,game
1373,"This game is so fucking trash I don't recommend anyone buy this shit. Mycareer is pretty decent as well as playing with your friends in a private match, but the online park is probably the worst shit I've ever seen in any game and I don't understand how the fuck the developers looked at and said ""yeah send it out"". It's not about timing or ""skill"", It's about who has better cheats and to top it all off the servers make me wanna kill myself. Don't buy this game. Go play basketball outside or some shit."

1384,"It's crazy to me that 2K manages to get worse and less playable on an annual basis. At the very least, you would think they'd just re-skin the exact same game to keep it mediocre. Nearly all changes made from 2K19 to 2K20 were negative, and that has seemed to be the trend for the past 4 or 5 years."

There's so much fluff, I want to blow my brains out. There are no tutorials, no dictionary, no easy way in. What little technical knowledge and curiosity I had about b-ball, has been replaced by unwieldy resentment and an association with suffering. Y'all are masochists playing this shit."
1411,its aight but teammates are DUMB AS HELL
1412,It is enjoyable
1413,"Actually exactly the same as NBA 2K19 but if you are in the market of such games, this is nothing new..."
1414,"NBA2k has always been an interesting title in terms of comments and reviews are concerned, Every year, the new title is definitely a replicate of the previous titles with some minor tweaks and tunings. It would seem therefore that NBA2k20 is a total failure. However, in comparison with NBA2k21 and NBA2k19, NBA2k20 is reasonably acceptable. Not impressive but acceptable. 20 animations and flow of game is comfortable, it is not really realistic but the accurate passes and alleyops make some good gaming experience. This is different from NBA2k16 where team play is very very important. In NBA2k20, individual prowess is easy to be OPed."

Game play sucks in both mytream and mycareer, my team is pay to win or u will need to play like thousand hours in order to great card and excellent release timing. On my career,  u will always have to face up against players that have a higher ovr rating, unless u top up and buy vc if not u won't be able to get good team grade and endorsement. Bottom line is if u r looking for some nice game play excitement, u will need to top up and buy vc in order to increase ur player's stats and rating.  Highly not  recommended, Luckily I bought this game with a discount of 90% off."

I might say that this game is at least the closest replication of real basketball.

However, sometimes I found some players (Computer AI) are really unfair, the rating is just dragged."
1445,"i love messi and christiano ronaldo, especially when they play in the same team"
1446,"This game saved my life.

I am 25.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline broken. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you

1470,"It is a good game as long as you play it in a single-player mode. If you care about basketball and are interested in creating your player in MyCareer, you will enjoy it.

In-game VC is not as bad as people make it look like. It is tough when you are starting, but earning VCs gets easier with time once you get more endorsements and keep unlocking accolades. You definitely do not have to spend a dime on it.

Playing multiplayer is a different story. Technical difficulties like lag spikes or disconnects from the server happen from time to time, but it is not too often.
All of the comments you see about cheaters here, though? Yeah, it is correct. It is not just people complaining because they lost a game or two. Mostly you will encounter two different types of cheaters:
[list]
[*]people who did not want to grind their player offline to get to the respectable overall to hit the park
[*]toxic players with fake REP, impossible to create in-game builds like All-Around Threat and with boosted physicals.
[/list]
The main problem with cheaters on PC is that 2K does absolutely nothing to ban them. You can't even report them, so they do not even have to try being subtle about it. That is one of the reasons why people avoid playing NBA2k multiplayer on PC.

Unfortunately, 2K has no competition in this field. As of right now, no other company is making a basketball video game. So if you want to play some hoops on PC, it is either 2K way or no way."

And yet the beta update totally failed on all fronts, no remap of the elite paddles and still doesn't have rumble triggers working, so if you have an xbox one controller and plan on playing nba20k with it, try to find on microsofts store.

Besides, there's a bug when skipping to next appearance. The skipping UI might not appear and you will get stuck, both the ESC key & NUM 3 key are not responsing."

This game is probably the last 2K game I'll be playing of the series and I will most likely go back to NBA Live on Console. 
 All and all, is it a fun, I play MyCareer, MyLeague, and online. 8/10. BUY on Sale."
1611,OUI
1612,Best $5 I've ever spent this year with friends
1613,awesome
1614,"I only play this game to waste time. Many issues with playing MyCareer if not playing at 1080p 60FPS .
"
1615,"this game fucking sucks dickhole waste of money fuck 2k ruins basketball 
"
1616,"Very fun gameplay and easy to use. Aside from its huge size, I don't see a weakness to this game."
1617,"nothing much, same like other nbas just players switched teams lmao"
1618,FRESH PLAY
1619,"Career mode progression is really slow. The game tries to force you into buying upgrades. If you choose not to, you'll just be sitting on the bench and making short appearances for a couple of seasons.
The online mode kinda works, but the game is too focusded on being flashy with an emphasis on clothes, shoes etc. 

Positives: Gameplay, Graphics
Negatives: Geared towards Microtransactions"
1620,"the game crashes on startup ever since the new came out, to frustrate the user into getting the latest game."
1621,Don't waste your money please.
1622,"The game itself is enjoyable to play with however as most players mentioned and noticed is that there are a lot of microtransaction within the game which I think hinders most players to enjoy the features of the game to the fullest. Also, I've noticed how hard it is to level up your reputation in the mycareer neighborhood not that I don't like challenges but it is usually takes a lot of time to play online with others, the queue time is so long, especially on The Rec. Maybe in the next series 2K could add more ways to level up your reputation. I know that 2K21 is much like this one with few to none improvements so I'am looking forward for this one on the 2K22 and future releases if ever. Also, I like to add that maybe 2K could focus on little things like for example adding the new championship banner above a team arena because I noticed that doesn't add up whenever you win a championship, it is just a small feature but adding it to the game would it make much more interesting and fun, besides it is the little things that counts right? Anyway, I like the other game mode, MyLeague, which I played besides MyCareer and I like the whole GM Mode in the previous series however I noticed that some features of it are now part of the MyLeague that is why I played the latter more. Other than the MyLeague and MyCareer are basically just the same with previous series and I don't play much MyTeam as well in case you're wondering. But, overall I still recommend the game, if and only if, you don't mind playing basically the same game from the previous series and just enjoy playing basketball generally."
1623,LAME
1624,"i never spent a dime on the virtual currency and had a good career-style game. It got a little too easy on the second season, but the AI can be turned up.
So, by acknowleging the critics and also ignoring all the card-game, online playground and pay-to-win stuff, you can still enjoy THAT ONE, long running game mode.
Additionally there is still the option to play with friends locally.
But despite having the WNBA and a player creator, it still is not possible to create a female character nor start a carreer with it. This WNBA integration just looks like ""green-washing"" the game franchise."
1625,"This is what happens, when a field has no real competition. The microtransactions are outrageous. Online is unplayable (input lag is crazy). Career mode is not rewarding at all. All of this probably applies to 2k21 as well, since it's the same game."
1626,Great game. Solid all around. Love the graphics

1633,ok
1634,"I really love this game and would like to see more players online, playing the 3X3 and other game modes. 
I  think  that MyTeam is a great game mode - as a matter of fact, this is the only mode I played so far.
So why thumbs down?
Because I hate the developer - 2K. They don't care about the players. I spotted many bugs a few months ago (including crashing, server problems, etc) and they didn't do anything about it. Nothing changed. I can't play MyCareer because there's a bug they don't know how to fix that brings the game to a complete halt.
I opened 3 or 4 tickets already, they always promise the dev  team will take care of that - they didn't do S*#t.
My friend bought 2K21 and told me he has the same problems.
After EA left the NBA scene, 2K  is a monopoly, and as such, they don't care. They really, really don't care.
One more problem with NBA2K games - hackers are ravishing the game: they hack the pause menu (make you wait until it expires, and if you choose to leave - you lose, even if the game says otherwise), and the worst of all, the MyTeam card market is totally dominated by some losers bots. They show fake prices, they raise prices in increments of 50 MTs, and they even bid for they own cards if the sale price is lower than they expected.  I wrote to EA about it - they didn't do anything. The forums are full of people complaining about cheating.
I'm not buying these games until they respect our money!

This is my last 2Ksupport ticket request:

The game crashes again and again, today  each time I play. 
I wrote you so many times before, first time in Sep 20'.
You said your experts will fix the game - but they will not!!! They will never do it! the last patch was on  Apr 7, 2020, the one before than on January 20, before that on Nov 19, so why should I believe any major fix or patch will take place.
You never meant what you say, I can't believe you anymore. 
You should consider a compensation for that level of  a bugged product.

1637,nice servers!!!!
1638,I play mostly alone. MyCareer is fun . Online players are insane but still good game.
1639,yes
1640,its a fun game to play with your friends
1641,"good for offline modes but in online this game it's not very good
"
1642,"damn

1643,"I bought this game despite the reviews and gave it a chance. Truth to be told, all of the negative reviews are 100%."
1644,I am not able to enjoy fully where myLeague save file keep missing or corrupted hence unable to retrieve my past data or league performance. it is really frustrating to keep restart and restart again. Hope NBA2k20 can help to provide update patch to solve this issue.
1645,"I like the game i like the shooting i like the grinding i have never played myteam so dont ask me

But the thing that lets this game down heavily is the community
They beg for next gen but most people in this game are cheating 
Then the people who play the game without cheating see it
So then they join in with the dumb argument of ""If they are cheating I'm going to cheat
It is not hard to get vc when you start nor is it hard to even learn how to play the game but if you are using a cheat so that you dont have to do any of it, there is no point in buying the game or playing it does beating people unfairly just not get boring like is there a point if there is no challenge.
but it dosnt matter because they think that there is no problem with it because if they cheat they know that 2k dosnt give a shit but it just makes the game not worth it cause i do find the online fun when im playing against people that arent cheating but at this point in 2k dont bother with and sort of nba on pc they will always find a way to cheat even if they had the next gen myplayer builder.



89 hours later: Still shit"
1646,its just nba 2k19 with more sweat on the players
1647,"This is a pretty fun game if you want to play with your friends on my team. I would get it on sale though.
"
1648,good game
1649,i had to spend 150 hours to be able to get a three pointer to fall. if you want to have fun in carrer mode go get an other. if you want to play with a friend on LAN its alright.
1650,i wish that controls were a bit better but overall 7/10
1651,"Got this [i]NBA 2K20[/i] in a bundle, didn't expect anything from it (I knew nothing about basketball) but I'd say I was quite happy overall with my experience.

I play mainly casually (only playing offline, or against friends) and I appreciate the gameplay of the game, with easy-to-learn-hard-to-master design: you can basically played with a simple set of moves (passes, running, simple dribble, shots) or go a little deeper and practice harder dribbles, different ways of shooting, and so on. The game looks good graphically speaking and, although I've never watched NBA in my entire life, I can imagine that the sound design (with the comments from the casters in particular) make the matches feel just like real NBA.

The career mode features a nice little story (although cutscenes could be shortened at times) and, even though the first few hours are a little painful, there's a real feeling of progression beyond that. However, there are inexplicable framerate drops during some pre or post-match cutscenes, although they seemlingly feature less NPCs than the matches themselves.
The ""My Team"" mode is a traditional card collection mode as you have in plenty of sports games these days. I haven't played it much, but I can imagine that it feels like a cash grab for many players.

Gameplay-wise I would only point out two little flaws:
- Succeeding a pass, a shot or a dribble is merely the result of how high your player's characteristic is in this domain, times (for the shots) how well you can time the pressure on the ""shoot"" key. No big deal there but it feels a little bit random at times.
- In career mode, there are numerous ""defensive breakdowns"" (i.e., event where you lose experience because you left an opposing player unattended although it was your task to defend on him) that feel unjustified. Sometimes simply because you seem to be defending properly; and sometimes because the defensive assignments are suddenly swapped between players of your team, and you're suddenly assigned to the guy who is about to score although you're several metres away from him. This is quite infuriating.

I also have to mention several bugs (straight-up freeze + crash, or the fact that some in-game ""necessary updates"" just won't operate because your hard drive is full, but the game won't tell you), the fact that you need a third-party account to access some features (...) or the weight of the game (nearly 100 Gb, really guys ?) so my experience was far from perfect. But for casual players like me, I think there is enough material there for quite some fun."

1664,This game is absolute garbage
1665,i like to shoot the basketball
1666,Same issues that have plagued the series for almost 10 years and poor performance on PC with the microtransactions galore.. Unbalanced and poor online play. I only play this as its the only option to get my basketball fix. Only buy this on extreme sale!
1667,More difficult to shoot when there is defender near your player.

1675,"I understand that people don't like the state of NBA 2K since VC got introduced, but as someone who plays for the GM mode and MyCareer (offline), is is probably my favorite 2K since 2K14. It's not the BEST but the GM mode is addicting and it's a lot of fun to build up teams like the Knicks and Kings into repeat title winners. 

I'm honestly fine just sticking with this one until they upgrade their engine for PC. It's not worth full price at all (I got it for like $5), but it's better than 2K21."

1677,Bad game. Still gonna play it tho

1713,This game sucks. I got it for $5 and even then it was a waste of money. The game will not allow your my player to score points at all which makes it impossible to get good at the game unless you spend virtual credits to make your player good. It is EA so you get what you expect.

1750,this is better than 2k21 (in my opinion)
1751,"This game only looks good on my 4k tv for some reason, on my laptop it looks like a potato, straight from the bin."
1752,"Basically a REMASTERED VERSION of NBA2K19; I expect nothing less from NBA2K21 on PC. Almost the same commentaries, and images of some players were not even updated. Some stars are still wearing jerseys of their former team 2 years ago. Some visual presentation has changed, but not much has changed, really. There are still some bugs here-and-there, in which some are also present in the previous version. Buy only during sales, unless you just want to waste your money on something that's worth less than its price tag. Might as well just update your roster on your previous 2k."
1753,it's ok. Not good at all
1754,I hope theres an update on the roster.
1755,"Update 10/2/2021. After a lot of emails exchanged and followed all of their troubleshooting instructions, the problem was resolved, and i also got compensated for the inconveniance (but only because i asked). So from now on, since the game runs smoothly without any problems for more than a month, i recommend this game. I'm happy that the support team adressed and solved my problem.

Update 27/12/2020. After contacting the 2k support and doing ALL the things that they asked me to do (and still the game not working) they replied that this is as far as their troubleshooting goes, and that i should contact a microsoft support technician!!!! After telling them that i have played 100+ different games (more like 200+) and this is the only one that causes me problems they told me to do some things that you can find in google search and forums about the games bugs and crashes!!! THIS IS JUST HILARIOUS!!!! Nice support 2K!!!!

I really enjoy this game, especially with friends! My carreer is also fun!
The bad things about this game are the non existant matchmaking especially in the neighbourhood, and most of all the crashes. I read that a lot of people also have constant crashes, from the game not starting, to crashing during gameplay. For me the game doesnt start from time to time, i only see a black screen when i click ''play''. I have tried everything i read on the internet but still the same thing happens. Due to the constant crashes i can't recommend this game. I hope it gets fixed."

1757,"You'll be in the middle of a playoff game, or better yet, just finish the game and BAM! Game crashes and you have to either start the game over or go back to half time. Absolutely trash game and the developers can suck a huge dick!"
1758,didnt get to play it much so i wouldnt know
1759,"I'm having fun playing the single player game. I saw a lot of the bad reviews seem to be focused on the online game, but so far the single player game is great. The NBA Combine mini-games in Career Mode were frustrating, but the actual games are fun as heck. I haven't played NBA 2K games since the 2016 one with the Spike Lee Joint, but I do like this single player story mode a lot better because I hated everyone calling my character Freq because it sounded like they were saying ""freak,"" though I *did* like having to pretend that I was adopted into a black family in that game! 

I'm more of a hockey fan than a basketball fan, but I will always appreciate a sports game that immerses you in the experience, no matter the sport, and this game does it really well. Again, I haven't really messed with the online community gaming mode yet, and after the bad reviews that I've been reading about it, I'm not in any hurry to start any time soon. Mostly, I give this excellent game a great review because I bought it during the $4.00 sale!"
1760,"My Career is pretty good. That's all I really play, so cant speak for online. Overall though I'm enjoying it."

1774,cool
1775,Single player is good I recommend this over 21 cause yea both are bad but at least this one goes on sale for dirt cheap sometimes
1776,"Finally, a game that is not pay to win, there are terrific ways to earn AMAZING guys, absolutely recommend MYTEAM for players who don't want to have to spend money, but want a challenging way to get a team."
1777,"great game
"
1778,Best 2k game
1779,
1780,"Biggest piece of trash ever made, until 2k21 comes out.

Its unbelievable that this series would get worse and worse year after year. This is literally 2k's biggest project every year and I see no work being put in, except for new ways to steal your cash with new microtransaction methods. 

Some people would say that its only fun if you put in money, but I don't think its fun no matter how much you put in. Because the gameplay is just unplayable, layups never go in once its on all-star or above difficulty, full white bars never goes in while half bars does, dunks would also miss at an exceptional rate. Teammates can never catch your pass properly and players always goes out of bounds for no reason.

The entire game is so animation based, it is so clear that 2k only has a few animations. Every player feels the same, because there are so many common animations for all players, Shaq would have the same finishing animation as Lebron or Kobe although they are complete different players. Its always the same animations. Every player plays the same, it gets so repetitive. You would know every animation after 10 games played and be tired of it already. 

The difficulty setting is nonsense. In stead of making the opponents smarter and better, they just changes the sliders, so tough shots would go in more often and the opponent would always get the rebounds. While your team would miss every open shot unless its green. 

AI is even worse than previous titles, nobody would play basketball like the players in 2k20/2k21 (cuz its the same game). When they were wide open at the 3 point line, they would cut inside to where the defender stands. Centers' IQ goes to 0 after they set a pick because they don't know where to go. Your teammates always runs to bad positions and everyone just moves so slow no play can be called. I called a simple play and it took 24 seconds to develop it. 

To sum up the gameplay, shots that shouldn't go in always goes in while shots that should never goes in.

The game modes is just like previous 2ks but each of them got worse. In MyCareer the system would trick you with your ""overall"", one of my build was considered ""86"" overall but none of his stats is above C+. I saw some of my teammates who are 79 or 76 have higher total attributes and badges than my ""86"" overall player. While MyGM/MyLeague was the exact same as 2k19, (and is still not changed in 2k21), nothing new was added, I felt so sorry for people playing MyGM/MyLeague because they spend so much just to get a roster update. Myteam is the biggest cash grabber, the pack odds are insane, even if you invested 200,000 VC to buy boxes containing 10/20 card packs. You still wouldn't get any useful cards.  

The server is also garbage, I once thought my internet was just bad, until my friends with insanely fast connections also suffers with online play/even connecting to the servers. 

NBA 2k series used to be great, now its the biggest joke in the gaming industry."
1781,"yes people with IQ
"
1782,Good game
1783,ass
1784,"This is just a re-skin from 2K19 so anything less than 90% off is wasted money. That said, I did have some fun with the MyCareer mode

Features:

MyCareer
Story is meh like pretty much every year. 

So let just go to my rookie season with the Lakers

* Best record in the league (68-14)
* League Assist Leader
* League Steals Leader
* Rookie of the year
* Defensive 1st team
* Broke the record for most steals in a game

Shirt sales: 137th.

What? I did all that and there are 13 complete NBA teams still in front of me with regards to shirt sales?

Other weird things in my team: 
* for some reason my teammates like alley-oops so much that missing one or two each game is acceptable
* players on a fast break suddenly stopping or refusing to run into open space
* players going out of bounds or making 3 second violations in every single game
* my 3-point specialist receives a pass when he's wide open, turns to wave to his girlfriend in the skybox, pump fakes a non-existent defender and instead of making a shot, drives up to the rim to get blocked. This happened a lot.
* defenders, instead of blocking the lane, rolling out the red carpet, a welcome mat and a cold drink so the opposing team can score in complete comfort
* I hate Kuzma (ok that might not be weird)

Weird things with opponents:
* Ridiculous numbers of blocked shots vs fouls
* Ridiculous numbers of steals vs fouls
* Players going unbelievably hot. I don't mind them shooting really well but if in a quarter they start hitting 50/60% green shots even with the defence all over them it becomes a joke. 

Weird things in general
* Poked balls bouncing around like we're playing with a giant bouncy ball
* Shooting meter doesn't make any sense. 
* Training is boring as hell and there's no explanation on how the star system works. I had a defence training where I stopped 8 out 10 attempts and had 1 star out of 3.
* Sponsor awards are not tailored to your player at all. It's always nice to be able to choose extra money for the number of blocks I make with my 6'3 point guard

MyTeam is a complete grind where even the number of contracts you can have is limited and player upgrades requirements are just stupid, having to make a dunk with Dwayne Wade while his dunking is set to something like 52 is just meant to be annoying. It has nothing to do with it being challenging. The online part is unplayable due to the high amount of people using hacks.

MyLeague is fun for a while but that's about it. Having Maravich score a 101 points was funny as hell.

I have played MyGM for a little while but not enough to form an opinion on it
"
1785,starting a second career mode game and I am asked to pay coins to proceed????????? you must be kidding.  not even option to cancel and go back to previous screen..
1786,money grinding simulation
1787,!
1788,black lives matter
1789,Don't buy.
1790,Better than 2k21
1791,Nice
1792,Good game play!
1793,Good ole 2K
1794,Chill game with chill songs
1795,Got the game as part of a Humble Bundle. I regret wasting my time. The face scan did not work. The my career story was a bunch of crap when all I wanted to do was play my player. The gameplay was messed up in the little bit of game action I had. I'm going back to NBA2k17 on PS3. So much better than this game.
1796,good game. too many sweats tho
1797,Good release..very stable and nice gameplay..9/10
1798,"shittiest game of all fucking time game is so shitty and unrealistic i dont even have to jump to get my hand above the rim and i cant finish a fucking 0.69% contested layup bro literally do not buy this game unless you want to rage and then want to kill yourself and then be forced to play this shitty game in hell. Literally pay to do anything you could be 10 feet tall and would get boxed out by a 4'11 little girl. U literally just get sucked in like a black hole. And thats only if ur a big man. If you are a guard and pass to a big man in the paint or they get a rebound in the paint. NO MATTER WHAT they will ALWAYS shoot a 100% contested layup ALWAYS. And if u wanna shoot do not get the steady shooter badge it says it boosts your chances of shooting contested shots and open shots, BUT YOU CANNOT MAKE AN OPEN SHOT unless u green it. Unless u wanna lose all your hair to grind out this piece of shit game u have to spend money fuck 2k and fuck u reading this for even thinking about getting this game"
1799,"I like NBA2K20 because it is very fun to play. The best thing about this game i would say is being able to play in the WNBA. Right now i don't really have a dislike of anything but, keep in mind that i haven't played it much"

However I like basketball and It's a lot of fun for like 10 hours maybe. But most of the ""fun"" is unavaliable untill you grind your balls out."

I'll just say, the game is $#!T

It's not worth the aggravation, even if it were free to play. I am a mad BB fan and this is just trash. It barely resembles the feel of the sport. Just bad."

4-game for grabing ur money then closes the server when the next 2k game releases
5=you pay  you  win game
6- highly negative and still 2k dont give  a shit

buy if it equal  0 USD  dont waste ur money  and 2k still dont give a shit"
1896,"This is a great game. 

Does EA recycle 2K titles? Yes. Should you purchase each 2K title each year? Ehh .. probably not, its the same game. It's like buying the new iPhone each year: Slight upgrade, different number version, same(BIG)price tag. 

With that said, this is a great freaking game!

Don't be afraid of the negative feedback. Check it out for yourself. Pick your NBA 2K flavor and have a blast playing.

See you on the court."
1897,It's a very nice game
1898,"i will like to say that i really enjoyed this game, carrer mode and also playing online with friends"

1906,boring
1907,the whole game is nothing buck hackers if you have the hacks its fun
1908,waste of $5. terrible buggy piece of s*** game.
1909,"im not gonna be an apologist for 2K horrible practices when it comes to many of it's titles - not to mention the NBA 2k franchise, arguably the franchise 2K handles the worst. its full of really bad microtransactions, game boosters, and various other pay to win mechanics. However, if you're not going to engage with the online elements, you just wanna make a character and simulate their career or you just want a game to sit down and match up your favorite teams, then you'll likely enjoy this game. The actual games of basketball are fun, the mechanics deep, and the simulation aspect rides the line between too easy and hard very well. the character creator is robust and expands on the previous NBA and WWE creators, and the photo sharing feature is great. it may take an hour or two  to take all the pictures in good lighting but the result is kinda astounding in its quality. My biggest issues as a single player is the fact that 2K reworked its virtual currency so if you want to get better animations and rituals for your player, you actually have to engage with other players and for the most part, get your ass crushed becuase everyone uses those microtransactions to be way better than you. I can't in good conscience say this is a good game, but if you can look past its commercialism and 2K terrible business, it can be fun."
1910,"good game, love destroying noobs."
1911,Nbaaaaa
1912,good
1913,"Why we are not getting next gen version
basically the same game with 2k20 beside the shooting  mechanics 
no cut scene wtf? what am I play basketball simulator 2021?"
1914,yessir
1915,"Great game, enjoyable but 2K fix the gameplay 😄"
1916,NBA 2K20 is good enough for any fan of the previous games to notice a big improvement. ... The final verdict deems it a worthy game to play in 2020.
1917,its good for pc hackers if you like that
1918,nice game

"
1929,The game is pretty fun if you play singleplayer however when you start to play online you may experience lag due to their awful servers along with bad fps as it poorly caps your fps. However the fps part is fixable but you'll have to search that up. Otherwise I think the game is pretty okay.

Play now and league and career all play fine but my team crashes and costs my whole team contracts. 5 games in a row i have crashed before the load screen finished. Days apart on each try because I get so mad at the damn crash i wont restart the game. 2k21 Demo showed me how trash next year is with the new shooting mechanic, guess i have to stick with console version of the game. If you play career and stuff its a good game but my team is beyond crap with the crashes.

2108,"As someone who was looking to get into more traditional Sport games and understanding why they are so popular; this is probably the 2nd worst place to start, with the newest NBA2K game sitting at number one. A lot of the game feels like it is trying to suck the cash out of your wallet and then some more. 

The 'higher quality visuals' that they constantly promote as an upgrade from the previous title is a lie, some of the characters in the game look nothing like their IRL counterparts, and I imagine there are way more complaints to be made from people who are more well versed in the genre. As a newcomer to Sports Games in general, I can only say that this didn't personally sell me on this series nor did it make me a fan of the genre.

The only saving grace that I can give it is the modding community, which have taken this game and messed with it to absurd levels. They're probably the only reason I have 3 hours in game, so shoutouts to those people.

Anyways, don't get this. Spend your money on something else or buy some of the titles that people like when they go on sale."

Maybe the other modes are more fun, but I felt like I was watching a movie and not playing. Once I started skipping the boring and overly dramatic cutscenes, I was greeted with mini-games that were just plain boring.

Heads up, you can get it for about 11 bucks on G2A. That is closer to a fair price point for what I saw on this game."
2132,Not even worth $5
2133,"cool
"
2134,"Let me just start by saying, I've played ALL of the NBA 2k franchise, so I know all of the gripes from the fans. I just bought a PC this year, so this is my first year experiencing the game from the PC side of things. 

I've also gotta say that even though there aren't nearly as many people playing on PC, I've found the community to be pretty toxic overall tbh, so that doesn't really bother me that much. 

Playing on pc gives me the capability to add mods for improved textures, face scans, etc. which makes the MyCareer gameplay actually pretty awesome! So that is personally where I spend most of my time. In that aspect, this is the best basketball sim on the market right now, and has been for quite a few years now.

The only other mode worth messing with, is the MyTeam mode, which is a great way to complete fun challenges, to unlock different cards/card packs, which contain different tiers of players/boosts for your Ultimate Team. The customization options for your MyTeam are ok, but definitely nothing revolutionary or game-changing. But I find it pretty fun overall, I mostly just do the offline challenges.

Now for my whole reason to writing this review, I KNOW that the community has a lot of hate, but I must say that 2k support is actually amazing! I accidentally deleted character with 200K+ VC invested into the build, and the support team was able to pull up that character and ""clone"" the character back to my account, all with a little help from their chat support! Whew! What a lifesaver!!! 

TL;DR- The game gets a lot of deserved criticism, but playing on PC allows for mods that can improve the game in a number of ways, and the 2k Support team is actually really helpful! 

But to be completely fair, if you're new to the franchise, or a returning player, 2k20 is a pretty good game, but definitely not worth full price. With mods, I'd give it a solid 7.5/10."

So this game is well known for its MyCareer mode where you can scan your own face into the game or make a custom character to hone your skills at becoming a baller and then play against other players characters and compete to make the best character builds. Now this would be just fine if this game did not release yearly. Because of the yearly release schedule, you will almost never reach max level on ANY 2K MyCareer character without spending upwards of 20$ on microtransactions for each character. (if you did it without spending money then good for you your either extremely good at the game or wasted an ungodly amount of time) Let me explain, the grind is absolutely horrendous. I eventually got my character to almost max level just before the release of 2K21, but that sort of defeated the entire purpose of leveling up my character because i wanted to use him in online play in the game (which is now outdated) and if i dont get 2K21 immediately and start working on it now i will face the same issue in that game as well. Many sports games are plagued by this sort of scam where it is virtually impossible to have a competitively viable character or team without spending money on it (Pay to Win)

Take the FIFA series for instance each year they release ultimate team with impossible odds on attaining the best athletes. For example, in fifa ultimate team you must pay over 1 million in game coins to buy Lionel Messi. In older fifa games at least (havent played new ones) if you do the math you find out you would need over a year of playtime to grind enough and get the amount of coins needed buy him (by this time the next game is already released and your old team has no part in this new game) unless you are extremely lucky and pull him in a pack which is also a scam (they are overpriced and yield little to no results for the amount of coin investment which causes you to nearly always lose coins) As i explained a version of this scam is being used in 2K.

I hope you guys can understand what im trying to get across. Do not buy 2K Sports basketball games or they will continue fucking over the playerbase and milking them for every cent. I love games and this kind of bs makes me sick. Games aren't only for the wealthy and its time games give players who are unable to shell out every last dollar a fair chance

2206,"I got this game for myself and for my friend so I could play online with them. When it worked, it was great.  But then, the game required an update and it simply would not download. After months of trying to get it to work, uninstalling and trying out various fixed from online forums, nothing gets it to work. I've tried contacting 2k numerous times and I never get a response. Its pretty ridiculous that I bought this game for myself and my friend and I can't even play with him. It's downright disrespectful for the developers to not offer any assistance to get their faulty game to work. I can guarantee you that I'm never going to buy another 2k game if this is the kind of customer support they're touting. It's disgusting that I spent more than 100 dollars on this game and I can't even play it. If you're thinking of purchasing this game or any other 2k game for that matter, don't. This publisher is going to keep spitting in the faces of their customers if you keep purchasing their subpar product. They won't bother offering any assistance until they get hit where it hurts. As long as people keep buying the same recycled garbage every year, then they are perfectly content with screwing over their customers because they know they'll just come crawling back each year."
2207,"     Game don't work.  Download update is stuck at 0%.  It appears to be a recurring issue that can only be solved via reinstall, and that's only sometimes.  The game just chooses to not work.  I've tried numerous fixes and the game just doesn't want to start.  My friend is having the same issue and welp, honestly, just save your money unless the game is $5 or less.  2k21 appears to have the same issues on PC as well so be wary.  Either way, it's a big issue ,from what I've researched, and 2k has done nothing to remedy it.  I know 2k doesn't care, but they've definitely lost a customer in me and I hope those of you reading this take the issues the game has into consideration before giving 2k your money."

2365,"Fun to play ... but mainly because i got it on sale.  The graphics are awesome and actual on court gameplay is fun. It remains the best basketball PC experience you can get , but 2K shoot themselves in the foot with constantly asking for more money (despite the astronomical price tag to begin with - if you paid full price). A lot of the game was cut and paste of previous years' editions. Park and neighbourhood modes are disappointing. MyGM was also confusing and came up a bit short. With myCareer , it starts well  , but the game play becomes grind-y and the commentary is extremely repetitive. 

Micro-transactions abound (as usual over the last few years' instalments) - it's not even worth arguing the point anymore. The profits outweigh any player concerns so the companies will never listen anyway. 

I especially found the ""2kTV mini-episodes"" unbelievably annoying - it's basically an ad for 2k21 before EVERY game you play with two over-enthusiastic hosts , against whom your rage meter will slowly but surely build up. Saying asinine things like ""2020 had its challenges but thank god for 2k"" .... really? 

After a while (unless you're a purist 2k fan)  you will put the controller down out of sheer annoyance - usually an hour or two in.  However , it is a testament to the quality of offline game play that you go back for second and third servings , knowing that annoyance will return. It 's a form of masochism. All in all the game is fun 

So yes , recommended....kinda.... as long as you play offline and buy it on sale. 
Definitely not worth USD $60 or 50 euros they're charging. I was able to look past many of the flaws because I got the game for $5 on sale. I'm sure if I had paid full price I would have been fuming."

2430,"I love basketball, and played when was younger. So decided to buy this game to enjoy and remember those times.
The gaming itself is not too bad, enjoyed playing on the beginning, but several things are pretty bad and the game rapidly becomes frustrated to play. 
Several annoying things.
I am 3 seconds on the paint, I get the fault. Some of the AI stays there camping more than 5 seconds without happen anything. 
Other, the game the opponents transport themselves in front of us. They are at least 2 meters apart next second in front of you or passing into you like you are a ghost. Almost is not worthy block them. Also, sometimes you are far in front of them and seems you hit a wall!
The game crashes a bit on transition on the menus. Also, lags on several occasions, like in the when you go to the bench or in the Gym. This last one not showing sometimes the bars or the help we need to finish the exercises. Needed to restart it several times.
If you decide not making the Draft and go directly to the NBA, you will struggle a lot to improve your player. I like to play on different positions and need to spend more than 2 hours making the draft for each build. Unacceptable.
One of the worst things of the game is the music. Terrible. Some nice songs in the middle but not playing often. Unfortunately, didn't found a way to cancel the music totally like I can do on the FIFA brand. One way is putting the headphones with zero volume when you walk through the Neighbourhood and go trough the menus. Unfortunately need to listen on other sites.
Annoying 2KTV transitions making a lot of noise about the new NBA2K21. Really annoying.
Other thing I noticed are the subliminal messages on the background and the politicised way of the game. Career story is full of them.Can accept a lot of things but not politics in a sports simulator game. Any kind of political influence.  Noticed this happens on some new games lately. This becoming a bit like braining wash for all king of political sides. It's really shames this happens.
So, even I like a lot basketball side and the gameplay itself is not bad, not buying new versions of this game. Unfortunately, there is no other Basketball option for PC."

2432,"While definitely not worth it's full price tag value, if you can pick it up for cheap you can have some fun with this until you come up against the end boss - the Lakers. Watch as your team mates fail to convert the easiest of free looks, or inexplicably decide to drive to the basket only to get blocked repeatedly by any of the Lakers in the same half of the court as them. Davis is basically the shot stopping equivalent of Mr Tickle. At the other end, things aren't much better, if they aren't launching a barrage of undefendable Oops, they're throwing up contested, off balance shots that seem to defy gravity to hang on the rim before eventually dropping in.

Against other teams, you'll probably have some fun. Giannis is basically a demigod but at least the rest of the team have some weaknesses. A bit more of a tutorial would be nice, they teach you how to shoot and pass but most of the other controls seem hidden until you delve into it. It's the best basketball game out there by default and enjoyable to make your own player and train him up through his Rookie years, just whatever you do, sim the games against the Lakers."

2478,"Got this along with other games as a bundle (did not buy the bundle for this game). I'll say this once. I don't know why people buy these games yearly for a roster update knowing already it's the same every year. People say it's bad, it's the same! Obviously, just don't buy it. You play one sport game they're all the same, you can't change basketball. However, you can change Call of Duty because there is some difference every year, at least. 2K and EA have ruined sport gaming for me any many people. Even though I don't like sports, I would rather play them in person. Trying to simulate throwing a ball by the press of a button isn't realistic. But hey, at least you can waste $100 on the same thing every year! So that's pretty cool."
2479,"Buggy mess! Apparently you can never start the game on full screen, the kind of camera that you prefer during the game gets reset every time you get subbed back in and the controller stops working out of nowhere. It's really sad to see what this franchise has become"

2502,"Haven't played since 2k17, decent gameplay upgrade from that one but still clunky and the shooting is all over the place especially in ''Park"". Other game modes like ''The Cage"" are dead. 
Decent MyCareer story, the options you have to take during interviews/dialogues are either corky or team praising oriented. 

I have mixed feelings about MyCareer mode, it could've been so much better, I'm not asking for a Witcher 3 dialogue menu, but still... the options you're taking doesn't affect your story at all. It's an unrealistic linear story and that's it. 

Also, there is no option to play as a female character in MyCareer mode. They could at least add the option (even without a story) to play as a female. 

Overall it's a decent game and since I paid only 2 euros for it, I had and I'm still having fun.

2510,"If you want just play with friends, the game is ok.
If you want to play MyCarrer don't do it!!! Don't buy it!!! Go for that money with the friends to a restaurant/party/concert. You have more fun. Or donate that money.

- Computer is cheating sometimes in MyCarrer (most of the players are sometimes gods, they do what they want, shot a lot of time from the 3 pt range -60 to 75% are success-, run through the defense to make a shot, worse player playing like a superstar, etc.). If you try the same things, you loose. I hate it and that is the biggest reason why I don't play so often any more
- VC (the money in MyCarrer) is gone. If I got some VCs after a match and check on the next day, sometimes the money is not there. Luckily it is rare. A small bug.
- Connection problems, sometimes you can not play MyCarrer cause you have to be online. If there is some problem with the connection/server/etc., thats your problem. The support told me that I have to go in some menu and wait for several hours for a sync. Is a sync problem. Yes, my life is just for the sync of NBA 2k. Better is to uninstall that game and enjoy your life instead to wait several hours for the sync. Instead to find solutions or make so update the gave me some kind of ""tipp"". NBA 2k can sync themselves...
Luckily if you try it again and again, maybe after 4th or 5th try it's working. But sometimes you can not play.
Sometimes the game kicks you from the neighborhood because your/some connection is broken again (Exception Message with some numbers)
- Referee doesn't want to give the ball. He stays and waiting for something. After 10 min. you can switch off the game, is not working. Instead to restart the game, go out of the house or some other stuff. Don't play the great game. Ok, that bug was just ONE time. But still it is better to go out of the house and enjoy to be outside.
- In MyCarrer the Shortname ""Che"" is in some parts still there. You can change your Shortname it in the settings but unfortunately in some parts is still ""Che"". I can live with that, small bug

Ah, there are so many other problem. At the beginning it was fun but now I could go crazy with the xxx game. I wish I could try NBA Live 19 on the PC but the game doesn't exist."

2539,"To be honest, I personally love this game. I mean, it's another NBA game. I know what I was doing when I bought it, and a knew it'd be practically the same game as 2k19. If that fact bothers you, I don't recommend this game, but I have dumped 102 hours into it (Mostly MyCareer) and I regret none of it. I will say, however, that MyCareer is  ALMOST pay to win. I've grinded to 85 OV but it did take around 90 hours of play because the higher your OV the longer it takes to get to the next level. It also doesn't help that skills also rise MAJORLY in price after a while (Like OV 70). I don't really play much other than MyCareer but I do play MyGM which is a whole 'nother thing entirely, but it's practically the same as 2k19 and 2k18. I hope this review helped you decide whether or not you'd like to buy the game, have a nice day."

Please, If you have any sense of reason DO NOT GET THIS GAME. It is a nightmare. It almost literally doesn't change from year to year. It has a TERRIBLE simulation ""basletball simulation"" my a$$. It is beyond garbage, THE ONLY Reason this is a basketball game is because you play the game of basketball. In no way does it accurately recreate a thing. Literally the worst game i have ever played. It is the most money hungry franchise I've ever seen in gaming. It's a god damn shame that NBA Live was canceled because NBA 2K is TRASH.

2560,How do they keep consistently making these games worse. It blows my mind that they could spend decades working on the same game over and over and not improve on a single aspect other then graphics. Everyone at the studio should find a different career path and never make games again.
2561,shit game
2562,"I have stopped playing the game (due to everyone flocking to 2k21). Despite what everyone else says, I definitely enjoyed 2k20 over 2k19 and felt the improvements were good enough. However, I do not think that 2k21 is worth the price if you own 2k20. The same can be said if you don't own 2k20 because of the major problems in 2k21 regarding draft classes, free agency etc. Though this is a 2k20 review, I do NOT recommend buying 2k21 on PC because 2k doesn't give a shit about the PC community. If you ordered the PS5, do as you please because they actually update the game on console!"

The game does not recommend playing in anything besides 60hz with vsync on which is annoying (otherwise bugs appear) which is just laziness in the PC port. I enjoy playing MyPlayer enough to where I get my $5 worth, but anything above $10 is paying too much for this game."

2611,"There is sooooo much BS surrounding this game, at every turn there seems to be something to remind you that there are some terrible things in this game. I use it for Season Mode, Casual games and bit of My Player. Its fine for that, thats about it. Buy on Sale, not worth full price."

2623,"I shifted from NBA2K14 to this, and that I feel is the only way you should go about buying these games. It's fun for me, I don't have any issues running the game, it's enjoyable, the cutscenes are kinda useless tbh but oh well, still fun.
Oh yeah I also bought it when it was on sale for ~ $4, so I only recommend for similar conditions."
2624,I'm just purely casual when playing NBA2K20 just to spend time with the kids & bought this game at a GREAT 85% SALE.  The low reviews are understandable but buying this at a very big discount is a steal.  Overall it's still fun.
2625,"To make it worth buying, I only recommend to buy this game on discount"
2626,mantaaap
2627,My first NBA 2K game and I am very happy. I did buy it on a 90% of sale so would probably not have bought it for much more than that :)
2628,Wonderful game!
2629,"Great game, been playing 2k for a long time and just started playing it on PC and on a high-end PC the game looks and plays great.  I also have it for PS4 Pro and would say it plays better on PC due to the fact my PC is better than the PS4."

2686,"NBA 2K continues its tradition of upping already tremendous gameplay, emulating the real-life sport in ways that didn’t seem possible just years ago. The inclusion of the WNBA may be this year’s biggest step forward, especially because it does an excellent job showcasing the many gameplay improvements from last year. MyCareer also continues to improve in small and noticeable ways, setting a new standard for story modes in sports games. Still, NBA 2K20 would have been better off by focusing on its complex modes like MyLeague and cleaning up MyTeam to be less dependent on microtransactions. In spite of that, NBA 2K20 remains the best at what it does. It just might be time to ask for better."

It could also be that I had no idea what I was doing so I wasn't taking it seriously.  The only basketball game I've played prior to this is NBA Jam.  So maybe this game is just better if you don't take it seriously, but then it's not worth the $60 it still is for some reason, is it?"
2711,it fun
2712,"Nope, does not worth even the 3 pounds I paid on sale."

2714,"Look, I wouldn't ever recommend this game to anyone. But if you have the money to blow on the game and time to get over how shit it is then it can actually be pretty fun"
2715,"Got it for only about $5 and still am disappointed. It's honestly just not that much fun.

Mechanics and Graphics are there, and why shouldn't they be when they've been decent for ages. MyCareer feels like an absolute chore, starting out is not fun, barely any actual playing of basketball.

I just want game that tastes like real game. This game does not taste like real game and is way more than 2% fat (microtransactions).

2730,Great game
2731,"this is my very first time playing NBA2k. and unlike EA, they at least know how to put the little things in their MyGM and MyLeague modes. the game looks wonderful, is easy to pick up....but, can be a bit frustrating navigating the menus to find what you want. once you really get to learn the mechanics of the game for new players, it becomes really fun. I don't play MyTeam so I wouldn't know what to say about that because I'm not paying one cent to any company that will turn into gambling. Nevertheless, NBA2k20 is a nice jumping off point for this who haven't played a NBA game or haven't played since NBA Live from EA (hate that company). So enjoy."

2737,"i have cheated on this game for 350 hours and ive finally been banned. i cheated to get my mycareer player to a point in the game where its fun and didnt just cheat for ego. myteam i cheated the evos so i could just play the game and not force players to get a certain stat. games dogshit, cheated to have a better experience.  i never cheated online to ruin someone elses experience. if only 2k17 servers were still up."
2738,"Ok, this is the first time I'm writing a review in steam. I'm a big fan of NBA 2k, last game I had before this was NBA 2k14(Sorry, I don't always buy the next game that comes out.) So anyways here Are my takes
1) The Story in MyPlayer was good, really enjoyed the the character progression and occasional cut scenes when you start playing in the league. No issue on the FaceScan.
2) Shoes in the game really got me like changing all the players in my team so that's win.
3) The Rebounding here is very hard. AI occasionally does like 3-5 Offensive rebound consecutively when they miss and I can't get my team to have a rebounding dominant stats.
4) Shooting in HOF is very hard. Rarely goes in.
5) My team mates who I'm not controlling are dumb. When a opponent cuts through the basket my AI team sometimes take a step in the opposite direction as if they intentionally letting the AI enemy score.
6) The Difficulty level makes no sense, I'm able to outscore a opponent like 30+ points in Superstar(Which makes it boring) but when I go to HOF they outscore me like 30. I was assuming that by going to HOF opponents will be able to play smart(Make Plays more often) but they're still dumb. the only reason they are winning is they can hit the basket even while I'm defending right in front of them and my Shot aren't even though I executed a perfectly good play just to have my 3 pointer get open.
Sorry but this is a step back from the 2k14 that I played."

"
2744,it's a great game for those who loves basketball
2745,its ass but when your good it gets good
2746,My Career is lots of fun and a worthy grind to get better!
2747,"What else is new?  Instead of improving the game, the barely update the roster, and try to sell you VC.  I'm done with this game and 2K sports."
2748,Spending money on a game is okay. But spending too much money is not okay.
2749,"I really love NBA 2K ever since I was a kid. I can't say negative words since the game's graphics is almost perfect. I experience playing in PS1 and compare to today's 2k, oh man, people nowadays are very lucky!!!"
2750,Was really getting into the game and suddenly all my files are gone and game can't save new files. After three tickets opened at 2k support finally one agent is actually listening and trying to help. These games have had game breaking bugs for ages so this is definitely the last one for me

2759,sometimes crashes constantly on the same match in career mode - once I had to play the same match 4 times to finish it...  A lot of commercials and other shit you have to skip every quarter.
2760,"As someone who plays mostly strategy games I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I can't compare it to other sports games as I have not played them, I do not know what other basketball games are like. I can say that I loved seeing basketball turned into an mmo. With complex builds and theory crafting and public meeting centers for casual and competitive play."
2761,"Hm, Interesting case.

Not the best, but definitely above average (I am not talking about casinos and gambling, yes it is a problem).

Controls are good, not always though(there are some hiccups sometimes of losing control or being unresponsive)

Mycarreer has went downhill (imo from 2017 we didnt have a proper career mode)

Online is fine with the guys, playing alone is wack.

I literally scored a record number of points for the playoffs (75) plus dished out 15 assists, but still the had the Bucks take the game.  Second game, I came out fast and put up my team by over 20 points.  I get subbed out for a 4 minute or so break, and come back in to a losing game.  The ""scripted"" games are just ridiculously stupid.  DO NOT BUY.  The developers show the same bias as the real life commentators and crowned certain teams as destined."

2787,"I see people not recommending this game, I would and I do.
Here is a review for 2K's NBA 2K20 developed by Visual Concepts

I've been playing this game for 2 weeks. It was a good career experience, enjoyed my time but to be honest it gets boring after about 60 hours. The reason is you are always listening to the same commentary while playing games, it takes a lot of time to start every single game and you aren't able to skip some animations. Also, everything is identical, you see this after your first 20 hours. It's hard to earn VC and you really need it. VC is in-game money by the way and you need it to upgrade your player's overall rating. I've played a few different nba games than this one and 2k20 is definitely harder than others, it is really hard to green release at the beginning, don't rage when you can't hit threes just get badges and check youtube for some tips. 
There are plenty of game modes to play such as MyTEAM, MyLEAGUE, MyGM, MyCAREER.
I suggest you to play offline, there are always cheaters and legends in MyPARK. And you can't win games.
Don't give 60 dollars or 50 euros whatever your currency is just wait for sale it's not worth for that much price.
These are what you have to know before the main review, here it comes:

First of all, I want to point out the graphics. They are truly realistic. This doesn't mean good, the game just looks real at all.
I will not be talking about the other game modes but MyCAREER. You start as a college basketball player, then few things happen (i am not going to spoil) and you go to nba drafts. Everything goes step by step. You even choose the song to play when you hit a three if you come that level. A good story goes slowly, it always continues. I had my own designed shoes too. You basically will enjoy it. But the worst part is the gameplay. Don't expect to hit all of your shots or layups or free-throws. This game takes time to improve your build. You will not be able to get an A+ teammate grade every game. About bugs; there are minor bugs that won't annoy you while playing, you won't feel them. You need a pretty good pc to play without lags. 
These are all I can say, a good sports game. Wait for sale as I said before. A tip, get quick draw and range extender badges for shooting. Now I will link some screenshots and a bug from our game. Thanks for reading.

An example of bug, I had 10 points but there's 8 below

2789,Was a great game. They turned off ability to play MyCareer on December 31st 2021. That means you only get 2 years to play an NBA 2K game before you can't play it anymore. Basically no better than renting a game for 2 years. Pathetic.
2790,w0w
2791,"It's ridiculous how much advertising is in this game. In the MyCareer mode, your agent and company representatives will feed you lines about different products that exist in real life, and you actually have to advertise those products on fake TV shows and in press conferences to get in game points. It's some Black Mirror type dystopia when video games are not only advertising to you, but they're making you memorize features of products to advertise to fake people. Trash."

I JUST WASTED MY MONEY. 17HRS OF GAMING MY A$$, MAY 17HRS OF WASTING MY TIME."
2826,good
2827,dope!!
2828,"DISGUSTING METHODS

I came back to the series after more than a decade, picking it up while it was on sale. I realy wanted to like this game, but there is a huge downside to wich I will refer later. The game mechanics are fantatsic and once you get the hang of it, the game is realy fun to play. The graphics and player animations are pretty good as well. The possibility to scan your own face via your phone and seeing yourself alongside actors like Idris Alba is kinda weird and utterly mind blowing at the same time! Although the story mode was way to short and did fail on using its full potential, I would not have much to complain, if this game would not turn out to be an outrageous money milking machine. The progression system is so unbelievably slow, that you just notice how the developers have planned to get you to pump more money into the game in order to be able to upgrade your player properly so that the fun doesn't let up. These methods seem almost criminal to me and destroy the gaming experience in the long term. I am downright disgusted by the tenacity of the developers. If I had bought this game at full price, i would have been pissed to the fullest extend. 2K should be ashamed of ripping their customers off in this way!

CONCLUSION

NBA 2K2020 is a fantastic basketball simulation infected with a disgusting and treacherous pay to win system, implemented by greedy companies which give the whole experience a bitter aftertaste."
2829,"This game is fun only when playing offline with friends. Online is a nightmare and servers are trash, especially in Asia. Single-player experience is practically non-existent. A lot of grinding is involved if you want to create multiple builds. VC is shoved into your face at every corner. Would recommend only if you can enjoy the game with friends over at your house."
2830,Recommended game but don't buy it at the brand new price.
2831,Got it for $5 and totally worth that.
2832,probably the worst in years
2833,"ALRIGHTY, THIS GAME IS VERY MUCH VERY FUN! THESE N WORDS PLAY THIS GAME AND STILL FUCKING MISS, BUT IT'S GUCCI CUZ I PUT IT BACK IN THEIR MOM!"

The first thing I have to say is that the soundtrack is just ""amazing"" (goat talk)
This game really captures what it means to join the nba, your a terrible player unless you spend you vbucks and I really don't want to spend my vbucks on this when I could spend it on some flowers to ask out my coach! AND THIS PISSING ME OFF NINJA FORTNITE NIGG-"
2853,"GAME IS CRASHING
"
2854,Great
2855,waiting for 2k33 Special Edition hahahaha
2856,"The game ran smoothly on my 1080ti, Mick Gordon's soundtrack was absolutely phenomenal, gave me an adrenaline rush during intense firefights, glory kills were satisfying, and the game encouraged you to change your style of play whenever certain enemies appeared or if you run out of ammo (which happens frequently). If you're a fan of Doom or a fan of fps games (casual or not) I would highly recommend it."
2857,game is shit
2858,I want to k**l myself. This game get's me in the worst mood. Like holy s**t! How could you mess up so much. The worst thing in the game is grinding. They just want you to spend alot of money on vc. I swear i spend 150+ hours on one player just to get him on 93 ovr. I also hate how litlle people there are in one nieghborhood. And then there comes a legend or what ever who can kick you off. Just so you know everybody are legends cus they hack. #fixyourgame

2873,"Good game, fun to play solo or online."
2874,all the game
2875,It was fun and I really enjoyed the myteam section but holy fuck this game needs an anticheat. It is insane what cheaters can do on this game and because its so easy i can confidently say well over 90% of this game is filled with cheaters in any gamemode. Dont buy any 2k on pc unless you want to play online because you will not have fun playing these 99 speed sharpshooting 7 footers on park.
2876,shieeety gaeme
2877,"as an exclusively MyLeague player, this is still the best sports franchise game on the market. Madden, NHL, FIFA, nothing else even comes close. can't comment on everything else.

also, I got it for 5 bucks."
2878,"DON'T BUY THESE GAMES UNLESS YOU'RE FOUR YEARS BEHIND. WAIT THREE OR FOUR, BUY ONE. FUCK 2K THEY DON'T CARE THEY WANT YOUR MONEY AND THATS IT."

2885,"It's fun time with your mates or in MyCareer. That's about it, but I can't post a positive review because the game has too many issues and bugs. Most of them were there in the last games and they just won't fix them."
2886,"I think my biggest problem with NBA 2K20 is the CPU cheating.  I am playing MyLeague offline, and there are just dozens of plays in the game where my center is playing up at the free throw line while the man he's supposed to be covering is wide open under the basket.  I can't very well visually monitor 4 players to see who is out of position AND play defense on the ball, so it's just endless garbage points that don't feel like authentic.  It feels like the CPU player decides ""Ok, I need to catch up, so I'll just have the opposing team center out of position for 5 consecutive plays"".  Then if I try playing center and get him in position, the guy covering the ball handler just lets him blow right around him.  I know this is cheating, because it NEVER happens to my benefit.  It's just garbage lazy programming.  They needed a way for the CPU team to ""go on a run"", so the easy solution is just to have it cheat.  When you've played an entire 48 minute game, and the computer resorts to these cheap cheating tactics, it's infuriating.  1/10."
2887,"g

"
2888,"Microtransactions galore.

Also crashes randomly.  Especially fun when I'm up 11 points with a minute left, and when I go back into the game, nothing saves, so I have to play the entire game over.  What a blast!"

2893,"this is a good game, too bad it costs a lot to be fun to play."
2894,this game is so fucking shit its insane
2895,"Great game, really feel like the developers listened to the community. Next Gen graphics with unreal AI. I mean man, 60$ for that alone is worth it. Now let me tell you, the detail in this game is so good they reused most of the assets from NBA2K20 in NBA2K21. If that doesn't tell you how far ahead of their time this game is graphics wise, I'm not sure what will open your communist minds."

2915,BEST 2k GAME!
2916,lol
2917,"It was really good! I don't understand the bashing of this game, the graphics were good, MyTeam was fun and Park was enjoyable. I also love MyLeague and it did not disappoint. The only thing I didn't enjoy was MyGM, but it isn't too popular anyways. Definitely recommend it! Just make sure to use Big Picture Mode when plugging in controllers and no glitches beyond that."

2927,"This installment of NBA on 2k was very enjoyable. It brought some key features as well as put in a fresh badge system. The game plays smoothly and is incredibly interactive in some gamemodes. However, I believe it also affects it's downfalls because it can be tedious or boring running to an area for one thing. 
Still a great game. 

8/10"
2928,trash game
2929,"Generally a fun game. I'm not a fan of the ""NBA2K TV"" thing, or that the My Team feature requires your players to have contracts - at least they're available to purchase using the most easily earned in-game currency. Although I still think incorporating premium currency into a $60 game is a crappy way to treat your players."
2930,"Eh bem completo e tem uma historia legal, recomendo p krl
"
2931,"I bought this game for 5$ , bought it for the fam as gift. Its totally worth it on sale."
2932,"This game is terrible.
For 30 mins I tried to change awful default keyboard controls to more comfortable ones, but I just can't.
Because there is no ""apply/save settings"" button, so after changing the settings I tried pressing every key there is randomly in an attempt to save the settings, but I couldn't. So I exited the menu and the settings returned to the default trash ones.
Also, why the hell can't I remap other keys? Why is ""confirm/ok"" not an ""enter"" key, but ""2"" key instead?? 

So what's the point making this great, good looking game that takes 100gb of storage, when you can't even get the basics right?? 
And I didn't even get this game for the full price, but for like $5 and it's still not worth it!!"
2933,"The level of greed from EA is on full display here with their micro transactions and blatant gambling systems aimed at the lowest and most unintelligent form of life, sports gamers. Plus the game just flat out sucks. It's a copy/paste of last year's game, and basketball is one of the most boring sleep-inducing things I can think of watching besides baseball. I'm glad Kobe Bryant is dead. Hopefully EA is next."

2961,"This game is really fun, it is grindy and after 2 days of playing (60 Hours) i'm an 81 overall. you do need a alright graphics card to play if you have an integrated graphics card the TVs and starting screens of games turn green. The game will stutter a bit but is playable, overall i give this a 8.5/10. I recommend GTX 1050 because its affordable and can run pretty high end games at high with around 50-60 FPS."

''This game will not be counted'' diyor ne sen win alıyorsun ne karşı taraf lose alıyor. Böyle işin içinden sıyrılıyorlar.Bu tarz sikim sonik, boktan işleri var oyunun. Daha ne olsun diceksiniz de işte 2K harici bu tarz başka oyun yok. Delire delire oynuyoruz."
2966,.
2967,"I got this game on sale, for all of those that bought this at full price my heart goes out to you. I have a GTX 1060 and even at medium settings I'm noticing a framerate drop every time I try to play local multiplayer. I bought this game specifically to play with my friends and I can't even do that. Would I say it was a complete waste of money? No probably not, it's always a great laugh to see I can play the WNBA league. 2k as always seems to disappoint, expect to get some coal this year, and if you pay an extra $10.99 there might even be some other things in your stocking too. What can I say though, you know what to expect when you're buying 2K stuff, I just didn't expect it to be this terrible. 2/10"
2968,"MAKE A FUCKING ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEM ALREADY. It's got to the point where park is just unplayable anymore cause its only filled with cheaters. EVERY gameE, like literally EVERY game there is at least 1 or even 2 OBVIOUS cheatrs and 2k just doesn't give a fuck. At least make a report button and view those players - you don't need much - their number of played matches doesn't match their rank - you can't be a legend with 20 games played. It makes me furious just looking at 2k aint doing shit about it."

2973,"It's worth playing if you like intense defensive plays. Unlike the previous version, it is more difficult for someone who has never played before to have a good experience on it because it's too difficult to score, even the rookie and pro level difficulty can be challenging for someone who played before."
2974,Levels above 2k21
2975,somehow my career mode got deleted this is annoying as shit ive spent money ingame and got so far im beyond pissed thanks 2k u fucks
2976,"Good game for the $5 I spent on it, although they could improve the AI because they make Kawhi a bum in this game (I expect it from Pandemic P, but not Kawhi). Honestly, Lou Will hits more shots than Kawhi.I'd only recommend if it is $10 or less and you don't already have 2k19."
2977,fun game lots to do and easy to play
2978,it's aight
2979,"This game is definitely a must have. IF you don't have a copy of 2k19, that is. If you do. Then dont buy this game. Its just like 2k19 but they changed the ""19"" in 2k19 to 2k20.  Pretty dope story on mycareer. I hate to play online tho. Can't  have a good internet connection. Fuck you globe. The game's pretty decent, unlike 2k18 and 2k21 (rn)."

2996,"It's money trap game! if you have a lot of money then you can win this game easily, if not then you will always be a loser or better be a toxic to your own friends. 
Cons- P2W, microtransaction, bug glitch. 

Edit: Dear 2K, please improve the game, don't just care about content for the sake of greed for money, wake up! Did you not learn from previous games that failed full of glitches and bugs like the WWE series / Mafia III series. 

Please remove the microtransaction system that's a bad thing!

They shove ads in an already 80$ game, on top of the VC that, if you've gotten far, probably had to buy at some point. Please do do not make the same mistake I did, do not give these people any money. Even the 5$ I got this game for isn't even worth it."
3008,"Wasted 6$ worth of my dignity and hours of my godforsaken life.

3010,"horrible scripted, bug ridden mess, online barely works, feels the same as 2k15 the last one i played, paid 5$ and its still too much."
3011,"I would only recommend this game for single player experience. The multiplayer is a very bad experience, with crappy servers, input delay and general lag that plagues the game. For the single player, there's way too many long-winded cut-scenes. The game mechanics are also much more sluggish than previous titles and the AI is weaker. There's honestly a lot of worthless crap surrounding what is otherwise the best basketball simulation in the market. The MyPlayer mode has a solid foundation for a decent RPG (there's literal stats and levels!) but the company decides to clutter it for the sake of clout chasing (e.g. long cut-scenes with famous actors, stupid nicknames for my player when ITS MY OWN PLAYER, edgy and cringy narrative and dialogue.) Other than that the core game is still engaging enough to play mutiple times. -- [5/10]"

The shadows that I stated earlier? yeah covers everything hahaha. Also in buying clothes and stuff, there's an option to try it on but because the shadows or whatever that black shitt is it coves everything and you can't see $hitt hahaha.) most cutscenes are broken too same with the neighborhood that black shadow covers everything. Felt like an unfinished game, definitely 101% pay to win stuff. Fun to play with friends tho who have the same humor as you and if you bought it at $3 or less? Worth to try. My sincere condolences and utmost respects to the people who bought this game at full price or anything more than $6. You are in my thoughts and prayers. This game is just so goofy and I find it funny xD"

3028,"I haven't played a NBA 2k game since 2010, and I'm shocked how little some of the irritations have been fixed. Not only that, but the transaction side of things have taken a huge forefront in the game (which i expected but still disheartening). I was never interested in online, just some quick play games or running a season, maybe MyPlayer but even the menus have become cluttered and a catalogue of messiness. The timeouts and halftime performances and halftime shows and yadayadayada all just slow down the game and you can't disable most of it. If you could skip these scenes immediately it might be forgiven but you have to watch at least a few seconds of every once of these scenes and it gets so frustrating when you just want a quick bball game without all the interruptions. Think rocket league how you can jump in play a game and get out just as fast. A NBA 2k game is so bloated with all the simulation extras that it hurts the final product and even when I feel like playing a quick game, I don't since the bloat turns me off from trying. 

I bought it because it was on sale for $5 and that's the only reason. At that price I don't feel bad picking it up just to play a quick game every once in a while, but by the end of a game, even if I had fun there is ALWAYS some things that frustrate me with how this game is currently presented. The game has essentially become a tool to rip-off NBA fans as much as possible and the gaming has taken the backseat to those dolla dolla bills. Not unexpected, but still such a shame."

3057,"As usual, all NBA games are trash. Just buy one once it's on super sale for casual gaming but not worth more than 3 USD"
3058,"Best NBA2K since NBA2K14, Originally had it on PS4 but for $5 for this game on steam you can't go wrong. NBA2K21 is not worth buying so might just stick with this for $5 and download next years roster when it comes out."
3059,bad
3060,fuck u ronnie
3061,"awful game. i have no clue why tf i spent my money on this video game. i was actually so excited to play this game with my friends but nope, dog. Played 2 games n got off, never played this bullshit again. DONT buy this game."
3062,Get it for 5$ otherwise stay  away also has some microtransactions
3063,Well worth the $5 I paid for it.

3071,"Bu kadar scripted bir oyun olamaz. 17 liraya mı ne aldım hayatımda ilk defa verdiğim paraya üzüldüm sanırım. bilgisayara karşı oynarken aynı adamlarla hemen hemen eşit oynuyorsunuz mesela. Ama online olunca rakip iyi oynamasa bile karakterleri iyi ise sizin adamlarınız şut atamaz oluyor. Bariz script var ve sizin hatanız değil. Böyle saçma iş yapılmaz. Rakip sizden iyi oynayabilir okey, siz rezilsinizdir okey. Ama aynı adam aynı yerden 10 tane 2lik atamayıp pcye karşı olunca kaçırmıyorsa orda bir bokluk vardır ve kafanı sikeyim 2k."
3072,"Awesome game that i bought for 3€. I have played this game now in 4 days and i just loved it, haven't played any other games than this cause its really fun.I tried out the Multiplayer with my friend and i won 2 games with 78-68 & 67-45 was really fun. Playing My Team was really fun especially when you can create your own team. My Career was fun to play."

3077,"As a first-time player of NBA2K, I was a bit curious as to why the game had so many bad reviews. The normal argument I saw was that the game hadn't added anything new, and obviously I wouldn't know about that. However, I can confidently say that this game was very enjoyable for me, the controls were easy to learn but somewhat difficult to master and I felt really immersed.

Bad things included: Sometimes characters would clip through each other, the game only crashed once and that's it for the bad things I've experienced."

3101,"I recommend this game if you want to learn the game of basketball and having only watched drunkenly with friends, cheering for slam dunks and celebrities courtside.
Been playing the game for awhile and I'm not having issues with ""crashing"" and I bought my pc at Costco.
I am having issues with the ball bouncing off invisible walls when the cpu gets near the court edges, instead of being called for 'out of bounds'.
I am having issues with players passing through my player on defense as if he was some sort of ghastly apparition.
The CPU tends to ""balance"" out gameplay with these outstanding moves born of supernatural origins.
The inconsistent controls are frustrating.  Especially when you think you are about to make a sweet dunk on the fast break only to bust out with the ever-so-flaccid lay up. 
Overall, My ignorance toward the fundamentals has created a fun learning experience for me....The Post, Lanes, Point Forwards!!!  
Idris Elbow is a weird addition to the game, as I only recall him from a movie where he played a pedophile African rebel warlord.  Why not put Marv Albert in the game attacking female fans in the background?
I do enjoy their take on Hawaii Leonard's disposition and Shaq's incoherent screeds.
Worth the $8, I suppose.
NBA action....It's fantastic.

3122,I enjoyed the game. I'd hold off on buying 2K21 though.

I bought it for 3.5€ and for that amount of money, I would say it's definitely worth it. MyCareer is great, Neighbourhood is a lot of fun too if you have someone to play it with. The only downside is that the servers for Neighbourhood are very very bad."

I don't know why (I just probably suck at it). Is it just me or the was the shot timing intentionally made difficult / frustrating? Even though I bought this with a huge discount, I don't think it was worth 100GB of storage coupled with all the rage inducing game play."
3141,its a good game if you only play offline mode :)
3142,nice
3143,"Games pretty good. Put a lot of time into it recently and really been enjoying myplayer. I didn't pay full price for it which makes the game better, but overall the game is pretty fun; I recommend if it goes on sale again."

This just helps my never-happening dream of playing bball with da bigboys."

3148,it's shite

3180,"   My first NBA title I have ever put time into. Thoroughly enjoying its deep ball mechanics and great graphics and animations. Got it for $7 on Humble Bundle and is well worth the price even if it will be outdated in due time. There are some freezing and technical issues I have encountered but not too annoying or game breaking to discourage me from playing.

   Micro-transactions don't seem too intrusive so far and I enjoy the grind for VC and upgraded skills for my character. I definitely recommend the NBA 2K titles for a first time player, the vast majority of criticism for these games are the lack of changes and additions each year, but if you've never played them before, there is a plethora of content and skills to master."

3189,GOOD
3190,fun
3191,I got this game for $5 and it was the biggest waste of money ever. So many graphical issues its not even funny. Couldn't get through an hour of it.
3192,"I can't really in good conscience recommend this game. There are some good points, like the graphics are good, the core gameplay is still good and it has updated rosters. But there are a lot of things that really detracts from my experience.

When you're shooting free throws as the away team, the camera shakes. This is a bug that's been in every NBA 2K game I've played since 2K13. I don't why it hasn't been fixed yet.

About every 10 games in MyCareer, the game records all the VC you earn, but don't give them to you. I had  fewer than 100 VC before my most recent MyCareer game, supposedly earned about 1000 VC in MyCareer and went to the progression tab, I hadn't received any VC. I've only played about 30 games on PC, but this also happened to me on PS4.

All the Gatorade gym training mini-games are horrible. Absolutely awful and poorly implemented. I don't like the neighborhood feature in general, but the rest of it is at least tolerable. I do like the new story. I think it's good that they highlight how student athletes are exploited by colleges. I also really like the player creator now, because you can make a really specialized player with a unique set of skills.

Almost all the improvements seem geared toward MyTeam and MyCareer. I don't particularly like MyTeam because it's like a free to play Mobile game stapled onto a trading card game and the only purpose is to drain your wallet. Game modes like MyLeague sees little improvement, which is a shame because I really like MyLeague.

In addition to this, there are a lot of loading screens and a number of bugs. The game crashed on my a couple of times and during the draft combine, I was spawned into a gym with free movement and other NPCs were standing in position waiting for the cut scene(that didn't trigger) to start. This also happened during a NBA game. This is also the first time the MyCareer mode is forced online.

In the last few years NBA 2K has become gradually more focused on MyTeam and the online components of MyCareer (Pro-Am). This isn't something I necessarily have a problem with, but it comes at the detriment of the older features like MyLeague and the some components of MyCareer. I think this product has become gradually more anti-consumer and cynical. The gambling aspect of MyTeam alone is odious, it's basically just loot crates again."
3193,yes

3208,"Maybe the worst NBA2K game ever. NBA2K games getting worse since 2015. 

There are skipless animations and visuals, make you stare your screen for nearly 20-30 sec for every foul, timeout, end of period, end of quarter, opening and ending. I just want to play the game. Why do i care rebound leader when im a point guard? Why should i look at James Harden's dropping assist numbers in every Rocket's matchup? I dont care about NBA2K21's demo. Im not interested in Dorris Burke and her speech. I just want to skip them. Ah i forgot the honorable mention, referee. When you get fouled and go to freethrow line for the first time, referee just tells some shit to players for 10 seconds. In total when you play 6 minutes long quarters, you wait about 6-7 minutes to play 18 minutes of real time. 

The AI works at least ""proper enough"" on older games. But in this game, even the simplest screen call breaks the game which causes defender to leave a gap for dodgin screen. That leaves you nearly wide-open or maximum of %10 contested statwise. Instead you dodge defender by just waiting and pressing left bumper and calling screen. Then rain 3s. Even AI abuse this. I see often that Curry call screen, wait for 3 seconds without moving and just take 3s. If you call a simplest gameplan, opposing team struggle to adapt it, causes easy points. Gameplay is really horrible in MyCarrer single player mode. 

There are issues with body colliders. You can use all your stamina to bump some1s leg and cant move an inch.

Difficulty settings are not boosting opposing teams AI but boost their stats, also lower your teams IQ to 0. The most irritating part is in HOF when i miss only 1 shot, my character going cold. Cant hit shots from close range, wide open with 85 close shot rating when i get full white bars. 

Also some animations are better than others (offers better frame windows for making perfect timing for scoring) but it is hidden so you need to constantly search for dataminer pages to get good one, cuz devs constantly patch them.

There are missing shot types and animations when i compare to older versions. There is a dropstep layup and dunk in game (i guess. there is a badge about it lol.) even i tried 2 hours to get a dropstep layup. i cant seem to find. also there is no knowledge about how to dropstep in controls menu. Only you can do is floater and eurostep. Dropstep and runnershots are missing. Fadeaway shots only available in post. There are no fancy dribbling moves. A lot of dunk styles are missing.

i did not play myteam. i dont have word for that.
There is a grind part in this game but i wont b*tch about it, it seems very easy when you can abuse AI.
Multiplayer part is laggy af.
Commentary is very limited opposed to older versions.
Curry special: Can make 3s from halfcourt.

0/10 i wont play again and not recommend
Also sorry for bed Englando xD

3231,"Disclaimer: I bought this game recently for under $5.

Anybody who's a fan of the series is well aware how 2K has turned the game into a ""Casino Simulator."" With that in mind if you can avoid the online and the VC mess and just play My Career, My League or Exhibition then the game isn't so bad. I got the game for a bargain so for me, just having a decent sim basketball is nice, but I would not pay anymore than $15 for the mess that is most of the game. 

So if you're like me and only play offline and can get the game for a bargain I say go for it."

3234,"eh, never played a game where hacking is this much of an issue, it'd be a million times better with anticheat, unfortunately 2k has made it clear that ""we will never bring anticheat to 2k on PC"" so i wouldnt get your hopes up"

It feels like you are dribbling through mud.

Bought this for 2$ and still regret it. I would have gotten more enjoyment our of my 2$ if I would have rolled them up and shoved them up my ass. Fuck 2k and fuck anyone who still pays full price for this trash."

3238,"Graphic's are stellar. The soundtrack is top notch. Game-play is enjoyable and it takes some time to get a hang of all the controls for both offense & defense. If you decide to play MyLeague, most likely you will need to adjust the cpu/user slider setting's. They are rather uncommon. It just makes no sense to miss every other shot."

3256,"Glad I only paid $5 for this. This was the first 2K I've played since 2K14, when I finally gave up on this series. It hasn't gotten much better since then. Questionable game mechanics, cheesy unskippable cut scenes, terrible AI... Why is my 7"" center switching on defense with the point guard 5 feet behind the 3 point line? Get sent to the bench after building an early 10 point lead, then come back in just minutes later down 15... Miss wide open shots that are timed right, but fling a mistimed shot and it randomly goes in? How many full court buzzer beating heaves go in nothing but net IRL? Why is the coach putting me (a starter) in the game with 20 seconds left in the 4th quarter when we're up by 20 points? So many things make absolutely no sense - and they're not new to 2K20 at all. What a miserable franchise this has been for nearly an entire decade."

3260,"The last game in this series that I bought was 2K12. I put over 1,000 hours into it; it is still to this day the third most-played game all-time on my Steam account behind Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4.

I'd avoided the series since then because they ruined MyCareer with the gross nickel-and-diming microtransactions, and the mode itself, if you didn't want to pay-to-win, would take 100 hours or more just to get to ""mediocre, legit rotation bench player on a franchise-mode team"" level of player.

But 2K12 started to feel like a relic after awhile; that was Kobe Bryant's NBA and Dirk Nowitzki's NBA, not Giannis Antetokounmpo's NBA; 2K20 cover athlete Anthony Davis played his one and only college season in 2011-12 and isn't in the old game.

For five bucks, I bought 2K20...and my gods, what an absolute atrocity, a disappointment at any price, a just plain terrible game.

Leave aside the gross pay-to-win multiplayer that combines a full-price retail product (or even one you get for 92% off) with one of the most exploitative microtransaction models in all of AAA gaming. You don't need me to tell you how awful that is.

What really jumps out at me is how genuinely terrible the actual basketball is, even in single-player MyLeague mode where you're not asked to participate in the MyCareer grind or to even look at the VC store.

The AI is straight out of 2K12, but the players' skillset is built for a modern league. The ""pace and space"" offense? Get real. Players with open looks from 3 will dribble into traffic and pull up for a contested midrange jump shot. The switching on defense is so bad that the player will frequently be forced onto a terrible matchup (player-lock yourself to the point guard and see how often you're switched onto the center every time there's a high screen and then bullied at the rim by a much bigger player. Take off the player lock and you can partially fix this but the AI will then just lose track of the guard for an open shot instead.)

Move the sliders to try and force the AI to favor the 3-point shot? Sure, they won't drive into traffic anymore, but then you're exposed to a different problem, namely that nobody short of Dame Lillard can make an open 3, and you'll add in a problem where players with a defender right in their face will shoot a contested shot with no chance of going in.

I have over a thousand hours in 2K12. The AI in 2K20 hasn't changed in eight years as the league has evolved underneath it. So it's not like I don't know how to play video game basketball.

And one other thing worth mentioning? Too often, I'd be guarding the opposing point guard, me just below the arc, the opponent out 30 feet from the basket.

In today's game, if you do that, point guards can drain a 3 from out there and make a defender pay for leaving them wide-open. It's changed the entire way that NBA defense is played and opened up floor spacing in a way that's wildly entertaining.

In NBA 2K20? The point guard will dribble down to 8 seconds on the shot clock, initiate an isolation, and then make one pass or try to drive the lane so predictably that you can take away the lane and force a 16-foot floater that goes in far more often than it ever has in real life...including during the early aughts, when NBA 2K was on the PlayStation 2 and that kind of offense was still common in pro basketball.

Terrible AI, a complete failure on the developers to understand how to simulate the game in 2020, and disgusting pay-to-win multiplayer and even singleplayer modes.

All of this adds up to 98 GB of hard drive space I'm going to use for something else, because this game's getting uninstalled for good after just 17 hours, unthinkable for a sports title.

Don't buy this game at any price. Don't buy any game in this series at any price until 2K fixes this, because right now they're clearly making too much money to care."
3261,This game is not even worth the $4 sale price. I have played THOUSANDS of hours of NBA2k in my life since 2k5 or earlier. They just get worse and worse every single year. This time I can even paly my palyer with so many glitches that wont let me sim to next appearance. Absolute waste of money trash. I will NEVER buy another NBA2k game. Waiting on that NBA Live comeback.

3269,fuck 2k but 5 euros tho .
3270,"This game is trash. You cannot pass the ball the open guy, they will let you pass right on opponent's hand or face. The turnover is real. Your rating means nothing. You cannot dribble cause they can steal from you easily. Your jump shot rating means nothing, you cannot make a wipe open jump shot and there is always cover from others, even you see the replay there is no one near you. Also, someone walking by you, you will get contested shot, even that dude just try to run to the paint and you just in their way. Stupid Game."
3271,Great fun.
3272,this game is actually really poorly made. The animations are horrible. It's almost like they made it just to make it. It looks as if there was zero to little effort or motivation to make it stand out from it's other games. Not even worth the 4 dollars I picked it up for. If that tells you anything. :)

3331,i had alot of fun playing this game on console but 2k20 is just full of bugs and just isnt worth it
3332,"DISCLAIMER: I've played every NBA 2K game since 2K13, so I consider my opinion valid.

Pros:
NBA 2K20 is a slight upgrade from 2K19, as the graphics, movement and animation selection all seem to be better than before. Also, the story in MyCareer is pretty engaging, but it's still quite similar to those from past games.

Cons:
As a regular 2K player, I was pretty disappointed with NBA 2K20. The improvements were rather limited in my opinion, and the game itself was a disaster after its launch. Endless bugs and glitches plagued every game mode and feature, which actually made me uninstall until the 2K team patched some things up. Even now, though, I notice plenty of issues with game play and scene transitions.

TLDR: Don't buy this game if you're expecting something new/better from 2K. Just like Madden, this is pretty much the same game as it's always been. I'd only recommend buying it if it's on sale for at least 50% off."
3333,good game but it dont need a new one every year especially when its exactly the same
3334,"gud

Every time I try to play the update screen stays stuck at 0%. I've looked online for all sorts of ""solutions"" but none work. It's so dumb that 2k forces you to be online to play mycareer. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME."
3337,"The worst game ive ever played. seriously! All the stupid cutscenes wich cant be skipped, i just want to play a game of basketball."
3338,just because
3339,"This may actually be the worst gaming franchise of all time. The single-player and multi-player team basketball game is pretty much exactly the same as it was in 2010, and the new additions have been things like MyCareer. MyCareer is a pay to win MMO basketball lifestyle RPG. The idea of building your own character and having him play for NBA teams is actually a cool idea. It's also cool to have him play online with other player's own characters in park or organized team games. But they have completely polluted it by allowing you to spend in game currency on power, and they have added more pointless shit to spend in game currency on like 300 different types of shoes, temporary consumable bonuses, and an in game casino... It is really disgraceful. If you wanted to play games and team practice to reach a competitive stat level to play against good players online, it would take hundreds of hours... Or you could simply spend $100 on in game currency and shorten that time massively. 

I can say with 100% certainty that the 2016 and 2017 version of this game was much better than all the subsequent games. I feel like the NBA is slapping basketball fans in the face by allowing this awful game studio to make games with their players and teams. Everyone complains about how awful EA is, but compared to this game, FIFA and Madden are incredible. As a big basketball fan, it really sucks that these are the only basketball games available to us in recent years."

3350,"A lot of advertisements... and sooo many cut scenes (some of them pretty good), but okk... it's the top of the top in basketball games! the only one you would enjoy!"
3351,"I can not recommend this game.  Crashes 10 to 20 minutes into the game, half the time I play it.  Another 1 in 10 times the game just locks up and freezes my system for a minute or two, then the game crashes out.  Given that I'm running a 9600k, 2070 super, and 32 gb of memory, this is unacceptable.  As far as game play, there is input lag with a wireless controller which I do not experience in other games.  The game was on sale and was in search of a decent sports title for pc.  This was not it, as it was an overall a disappointing experience.  And don't forget the emphasis on micro transactions, those sweet sweet micro-transactions."
3352,this thing is ridiculous. made with full disrespect to basketball and human movement physique. lets start how realistic it looks when ball flies 10 cm from the player u intentionally were passing and in the replay u can see how his eyes are following the ball but  does not grab it(looks spastic TBH). and the more you increase the difficulty level the more absurd it gets. yes thats right not that the enemy ai gets better in witch this game they dont its just they make more ridiculous shot attemts and makes them. instead they decrease game flow speed and makes it more stagnatic and unrealistic witch it makes frustrating to play by just what ridiculous things gonna happen in the game. its like the ai is directing how the game is gonna play out not you. sometimes you cant do nothing. they will turn the ball over xDD you want it or not. and the final point would be why in the hell name of the devil would you buy a game for 50 buck when any other game devs actually puts some effort ir repairing bugs increasing stability and whatsoever. in here you dont get nothing you get the same game every year with same issues no matter what comunity says or anybody that have sense of basketball and the love for the game. its really sad that nobody makes a decent basketball game. ps  i beat the game dificulty levels at full game time thats how i play and play all dificulties. 2k u are disgrace for basketball and sports if u dare to sell this. expect the 2k21 the same not gonna spend money on that garbage. the game itself makes me not want to play it no matter how stupid that sounds. i genuinely wish that people stop buying this and somebody with the sense of love gonna start creating some basketball beast game that you would not need to replace at least for couple of years because thats how good it would be its just a dream.

3413,Fun but has way too many bugs and 2K doesn't care enough about its customers to fix them. There has been a lasting and an unresolved problem with playing online and with the card tiles in MyTeam mode. Some including myself have experienced the problem where the controller and keyboard and mouse stop working once you have joined an online game. This means you cannot control your players or any others. Since this has no fix and 2K doesn't care i and many others cannot play online with anyone including close friends. This is a serious cause of irritation and i'm frankly surprised with how good 2K sales are when there customer service is so terrible. They make the same game every year and everyone still buys it. The only reason i got it is because of my friends and because it was 5$. I like MyCareer in most sports games but i still play with my friends and this game doesn't allow me and other dissatisfied customers to do so. Fix your game 2K or start making them correctly the first time.

The only other game I've played where cheating is nearly as bad as on this game is gta 5 and rdr2 and both of those games share a parent company with this game in take two interactive. It's extremely buggy with the graphics settings on pc when you turn down some settings there is a bug where the entire neighborhood has the same pitch black texture except for signs and players. The game is just packed full of bugs, such as in mycareer when you are subbed out and there is supposed to be a button to sim until the next appearance which will fail to appear for extreme lengths of time if your game is not capped at 60fps and sometimes crashes due to it making you lose what you've done for that game. The game is capped at 60fps for the online modes which on top of horrendous servers makes the online gameplay run like a handicapped geriatric when compared to the single player and I haven't even mentioned how often you will be disconnected for no reason at all. Another very fun bug is how in online games you sometimes just randomly deal with framerate stutters of dropping from 60 to <10fps which will persist throughout the entire game you play. I really want to recommend this game to friends because I genuinely have a great time playing this game when everything is working. It has so much more potential on pc however, there is no support for voice chat on pc, we don't get the demo for the next game. We get the next gen releases a year late, and despite that we are subject to the same predatory pricing and monetization as the consoles which are supported so much more. The basketball gameplay usually improves year after year but I am disappointed every year due to the utter neglect and silence that 2k treats the PC platform to making version of the game with the most potential into the version of the game with the most headaches and I do not see that ever changing in the foreseeable future."
3451,better than 2k19
3452,"The game feels much more sluggish than previous titles. Some call it realistic, I call it unfun. Animations are too long and carry you too far away in my opinion. Realistic, maybe. But not fun.

The presentation is quite impressive, until you realize you need to press the A button 4+ times to skip the halftime show. Too much of the game is spent waiting for it to let you play again, or waiting for animations to finish.

The presentation also funnels you to the modes that you can spend money on. Modes such as MyTeam (the play weird challenges to get card packs for better players mode) don't allow any customization. You play these specific games with 5 minute quarters, with the predetermined sliders and whatnot. Essentially 2k decides how you play, so that they can push you to frustration and spend real money. It could be fun, but it just feels gross.

If you have an old 2k game (2k16 or before) I recommend sticking to that, as the games haven't really gotten more FUN over the years, even if animations are ""better"" and the game looks shiny."

3460,"It is not often that a game could still not be worth it even for $5, but 2K finds a way to make it happen. Severe and numerous gameplay issues favoring the cpu opponent continue to plague this franchise, which has grown complacent in the absence of competition. 
Additionally, this game is around 100gb install, most of which is filler substance that, admittedly, does add a bit of flair and realism to the game, but is unable to be turned off for those who do not care about it. 

I feel sorry for those who paid full price for this game."

I don't understand why so many websites laud the MyGM mode. Most of your time will be spent ""chit chatting"" with players, staff, etc. It's also riddled with glitches/bugs. I was looking for another franchise mode to play besides MLB The Show, but this isn't it."

3530,"Cash grab career mode.

I like sports games for the career mode building your player from a rookie to a big name. Admittedly I haven't had an nba game in some time, but the mechanic for career mode in this game is ludicrous you get ""vc"" which you use to upgrade your stats, but with the starter stats your player can't hit an open look midrange shot as a point guard if your shot timing is even one iota off of perfect. Luckily you can pay extra money to buy VC to upgrade your player or grind through four or five NBA seasons to get the needed coin to make career mode playable. At $80 this is a farce."

3540,"[h1]Great game[/h1]
[b]NBA 2K20 is a great game for those who has a controller[/b]

Personally, I play on keyboard and can't bother to buy a controller just to play this game.
The game is really fun, however, I feel like the developers should've paid more attention to people playing on keyboard.

Using controller is easy, however, playing on keyboard is probably one of the hardest things you'll do in your life.
Either way, great game.

This game is complete and utter garbage for $60 and has been a copy and paste for the past 5 Years... $2 is more of this games true value since they dont put in much work for it a year anyway. Also by the looks of it 2K21 on Steam will not be the next gen version so id highly recommend you get this when it does go on sale. Sad how they are now planning on jumping the price to $70 when they dont do shit.
3547,"The best basketball game you can buy. Much similar to every 2k game. Had it on console and loaded it up with over 60+ hours, bought it on PC for $6 and I have already hit another 25hrs on PC! 10/10"

The shot meter always changes 2k12 was probably the best. I never been so pissed with a games mechanics. Super glad I got a copy for 4 bucks because I would be so pissed if it was full price. This game sucks big ones. The pay to win bs has truly ruined games and the sports gaming industry is ass."

3612,"Purchased this game for $4 on sale.  Not $40, $4.  Thinking to myself ""for $4 it can't really suck""...well it did. The shooting mechanics are awful.  Like AI hitting 80% overall and you missing 50% of your layups...after maybe 7 or 8 hours of play there is no indication whatsoever of how to shoot the ball in terms of timing. If you go to the tutorial you get the timing down easy..then into the game and seemingly the same shots you were sinking one after the next in practice are all rim outs.  Every once in a while you get the green shooting bar, indicating a ""perfect"" shot, but no way of telling whatsoever how you did it.  On offense literally nobody is open ever.  Pass the ball around to your heart's content but you'll never find an open man."
3613,"MyCareer is really fun and the game runs really well! It's got its fair share of issues for sure, but it's really fun and if you don't play console this is the best way to play NBA.

3631,This game is complete garbage bin material. My career is a joke. You have to be online for it which is stupid. I don't care about online play at all in the slightest. I play this game to kill time by myself not to play against other players. It is just a money grab. 2k14 was the last year the game was decent. Even if this game is free I would say no thanks. They make it brick city so you spend money for VC which I will NEVER do. So your only choice is to grind a stupid amount or spend money. If you don't spend money enjoy riding the pine in games a lot since in this version you barely play. In 2k14 I could start within 6 to 10 games and score 15 to 20 from the first game.

3654,"READ BEFORE YOU BUY!!! 

I went through Hell and back, but I was finally able to get this game installed with the multiplayer features in tact. I wrote a rather nasty review, but instead of leaving it, I wanted to put this warning out there and offer a more constructive posting rather than just saying to not buy the game. Given my experience with this one, I am not planning on buying from this developer again.

NOW THE HELP PORTION:

IF you decide to buy this game and install it, when the game launches for the first time, it is going to ask for your date of birth. There is a minimum age requirement to access online game play, HOWEVER, you would think it should be easy to put in your correct birthday. IT IS NOT. The menu has Month, Day, and Year top to bottom. There are hash marks in the fields where the birthday goes and arrows on each side. You can cycle through the months and days with the arrows just fine, BUT BE CAREFUL WITH THE YEAR! If you click the right arrow, the game will stop you right there and give you a message that says you are too young to play online and the online features will be LOCKED!!! USE THE LEFT ARROW TO SELECT THE YEAR OF YOUR BIRTHDAY!!!!!

I've read the game is full of pay to win micro-transactions that give people an advantage with programming mechanics of the game I do not even know of yet, but I don't really care about any of that. Rubbish purchases are just that and are designed to accommodate plebs. People who want shortcuts in life are the problem and they are the reason game companies get by with doing what they do. If you don't enjoy playing with those types of people, I would suggest only playing with friends who you know view games the same as you. Let the rest of the riffraff battle with their wallets.

I ultimately had to make a return to steam and re-purchase the game in order to enter my correct birthday. I spent a lot of time reading forums and trying various other methods in order to remedy the problem, and I even requested help from the Dev, but in the end the return and re-buying seemed my only timely solution. I did manage to pick the game up cheap, but considering how much money I make per hour when I am working, I definitely overpaid.

Buy the game or don't. I just hope this helps at least one person to not make the same mistake. Good luck!"
3655,"I got this game for free and still got robbed. Shit animation, shit cut scenes, clunky game play. Even 2k16 was better than this game in terms of gameplay.

Loading from an SSD and it can still take up to 2-3 minutes every time it loads. Definitely not helped by the fact that it loads twice pre and post game, for player arrival and pre-game show, as well as the walk to the locker room and interviews. 90% of which are very unsubtle adverts. 
It's a fun game when you are playing but it's just not worth having to wait around for so long, especially considering much larger games load in a fraction of the time."

3683,Not even worth the 5 dollars when I bought it on sale.
3684,Too many bugs when it comes to my players
3685,No UX in this game. Incredibly complicated to configure everything without a joystick
3686,Good game
3687,Good game. It is hard to play with keyboard but its worth scraping 60 bucks for a xbox gamepad so the game feels more enjoyable.
3688,its cool
3689,POO POO GAME BUT FUN WITH FREINDS
3690,"yeah, nice"
3691,Ball go swish
3692,trash game and any money 2k 21 is gonna be just as trash if not more.
3693,Very good game
3694,love it
3695,PS4 Has better parks
3696,why do i buy this game every year
3697,"First NBA 2K game i brought since NBA 2K14 , 92% off is too good to not even consider, Overall Good for Mygm mode , too complicated at times though , performance wise so far didn't notice any glitches , runs on high-ultra settings at smooth 60fps on my 1060 card and i7 8750h processor."
3698,its like skyrim with guns
3699,"The game is only good playing by yourself, all the servers are filled with modder's  making it difficult to have fun playing neighborhood. It wouldn't be that bad if the devs actually cared about the game and actually punished modders but they don't."
3700,"The game is not meant to be played well on PC. Don't download it because its glitches and is very slow. I have a 6gb videocard and an i5 9th gen, still the game runs slow on low detail levels, windowed mode, lowered resolution. Battlifield 5 runs on ultra with no glitches, this game does"
3701,i think 2K server is the worst i have ever seen in my life. Even for console
3702,I love this game.
3703,dont buy if u dont have controller
3704,"i never heard of basketball before thsi game, only after i polay i hear of lakers and lebron now im no1 fan"
3705,i cant play my carrer im always on bech what is this i paid money plz do something
3706,trash game

3712,"Nice graphics. Multiple game modes. Variety of moves available. Just one small change required. If we get outbid on an auction, can you make it possible to get our mt back immediately? Otherwise no issues at all."
3713,"Really nice game, I recommend it!!!"
3714,"I got this game on sale for $4.80. I will say, it is what I would expect out of a 5 dollar game. Is it worth the 5 bucks, sure, I'd say so. HOWEVER, it is in no way worth the 100+ GB download space. I could download Skyrim 5 times but instead I have this shit. The game crashes at LEAST 3 times a day and sometime crashes on startup twice in a row before I can finally play.

1. MyCareer
Good god. The story itself is quite good in some spots, but it's ruined by many things, the constant cutscenes which are just needless in some spots. You go from cutscene to cutscene, play 2 mins worth of game and another cutscene. Some parts seem like they were written by a 5 year old, needless cringe jokes and bad puns between characters leave you feeling just plain awkward. When it comes to player improvement, it has never been slower. I saw some post where you have to play for about 120-130 HOURS before you MyPlayer reaches max attributes. It's just one giant push to make you spend more money. 
2. MyTeam
 Yawn, It's still just the same old gamemode that 2k has had for years. I'm not much of a PvP kind of person so I was hoping for at least a little bit of fun against the CPU. Nope, there are hundreds of single-player challenges to choose from, allow me to walk you through them. Step 1. Try and beat team. Step 2. Beat team because the game puts it on Rookie difficulty. Step 3. Repeat Step 1 except the difficulty is one level higher. Oh no, my 30 point win is now only a 25 point win. So much harder. Step 4. Log off after 2 games because you get bored of playing the CPU on Rookie difficulty. That's MyTeam in a nutshell. 
3. MyGM
Eh, It's a GM mode, I like it.

Overall, 2.5/10. Wait till it's 5 bucks."
3715,"SUMMARY:

FULL OF BUGS AND CHEATERS"

3720,"Game is trash. Runs like crap, has game breaking cheese moves & players like every year. Single player has been 100% turned into at cash grab grind/pay to win just like the online has been for years now. I HATE how this is the only basketball game on the market. DON'T BUY THIS POS EVEN FOR $6! I've already wasted my money, don't waste yours. Fuck 2k, all my friends hate 2k."
3721,"Good game overall not the best out of the series but certainly better 2k19 game keeps crashing which is annoying overall the game is shit its like playstation home with basketball but im still going to play it 
"
3722,"waste of $4.80, could have had more enjoyment throwing that cash out the window. Now they'll use these funds to prop up WNBA"
3723,"Terrible port, basically P2W and why tf do i need to cap my fps and switch on vsync for it to run properly
"
3724,yes many hackers
3725,i liek it ah lot mehehe
3726,Dont Waste your time or money. The download is very glitchy. If you dont verify your email in 48 hours you my player account will be deleted.
3727,great games
3728,this one got more players and it fun if you like the park only thing i dont like is noone play any where just the park i like to get pro or rc game going
3729,It's 2K. same game people come to expect from this franchise. Looks great on PC.
3730,it´s really not that bad tbh. maybe people hate it for server issues but I´ve only played MyLeague and it´s pretty nice.
3731,ANOTHER YEAR OF 2K I GUESS
3732,7$
3733,Same as others its frustrating having to grind all the way in my career feels almost mandatory  to buy that a bunch of vc just to get through the game.
3734,A scam cleverly disguised as a basketball game
3735,Banned me for no reason shit game
3736,"I'm a casual player with this franchise.  Last version I owned was 2k13 for PS3.  Read a lot of negative comments about this game and I was iffy on whether or not to get it even at under $7CDN.
It looks good on my computer.  Gameplay wise I can't complain for the price.
There is a weird sound issue as in there's no sound at all from the game when using HDMI as my out audio source.  There's fixes online and stuff but if I just use my wired headphones and plug them into the computer as mu output sound source then the game has sound again.
All in all Ive been plaing sports games for a looooooooooooooooooooooooooong time and this game offers what I would expect to get out of it as an OG gamer."
3737,"I haven't played a basketball game since NBA Live 2004. I actually like this game, the career mode is pretty legit and you really have to work to make your player good. I haven't tried online yet, but I'm sure it's fun. Give this game a go if you like story based sports games."
3738,"Mycareer games are scripted. You can absolutely carry your team, and you will manage to lose. Your team can be ahead with 3 seconds left, and you can (and will) be subbed out to lose by 1. I'm not sure if this is a new feature as I haven't played any releases since 2k17, but this game is god-awful."
3739,"Worth every penny, if you love basketball you gotta have this.

The neighborhood online option is amazing, you get to play others in 1v1, 3v3, 2v2, whatever, teams, etc. The MyPark option is great, you train with other people and hit some 3s in their face if they talk shit. 10/10 recommend."
3740,This game sucks!!
3741,"Just go the game as a GIFT for 4€ And you know what ? This game is trash as fuck !! I can't even fucking sprint when i don't have the ball !! How am I suppose to defend a block or anything else when the player is sprinting ?
Just don't buy it, save money and time."

3744,"Graphics: 2 / 5

3749,no
3750,"Do yourself a favor:

Dont buy this game unless its 90% off."
3751,Its good!
3752,"In this game you don't pass, as bots on your team can catch and drop a ball to grant you turnover... or they just simply don't bother catching the ball and getting hit in some parts of their body making funny faces.
To win games, just take the most thug-like guy and get physical, as the game tends to move players in a way when you, or some of the bots, just simply charge into 4 guys under a basket to score a Moses-like dividing all character models like a red see bucket."
3753,Good
3754,incredibly buggy
3755,"I'm not sure what was happening here but the game was unplayable even on the lowest graphic settings. I tried resetting and using recommended settings but still no luck. 

I'm using a 2020 Razer Blade 15"" advanced model with a 2080 Super Max-Q, i7-10875H and 16GB RAM. If I'm not able to get above 10-15 FPS... who is? 

I requested a refund after  about 45 minutes of trying to toggle video settings to get it working."
3756,Best
3757,"the game sucks ass.

let me tell you why:
- unskippable cutscenes
- game capped at 60 fps
- ads during loading screens
- the grinding is painstakingly bland
- MyCareer is boring to play and grind
- lots of modders ruining online
- MP players play with 7' ungodly creatures with wingspans longer than their lifespan, making them unguardable even by God
- both of my parents were ashamed of me after figuring out that I bought this game with their money
- my father especially hated me for taking his money to buy THIS GAME out of any other steam games
- my mother figured out that I also bought a 2019 Kia Stinger GT alongside the game
- the point above doesn't correlate with this game's review
- they kicked me out of the house so I had to play this game on my PC at the gas station
- I forgot to install any other game besides NBA 2K20 in this PC
- there's no wifi so I couldn't even play MyCareer
- 2020 sucks ass

buy this game if you hate yourself too."

or maybe you want to buy nba2k21 games right away? Hopefully is better."
3770,it has a ball
3771,"While I have enjoyed the gameplay, over half the time I try to play single player myplayer I am unable to connect to the server and receive an error code. If your game requires internet to play single player mode so you can milk players for microtransactions, fine, but at least ensure it works. Very frustrating to buy a game and then fail to connect when I want to play."

Just get the prior year's 2K and download a user-created roster update for the exact same game at a fraction of the price. 2K has consistently chosen not to improve their gameplay, MyGM mode, MyLeague mode, or thier AI logic. The only reason I bought this was due to the fact that it was $5 on steam. It is LITERALLY THE EXACT SAME GAME AS NBA 2K19, 18, 17 and so on."

3794,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVEN ON SALE!
This game is terrible and should never have been sold. the servers are bad, good luck ever finding one without lag. so you are basically forced to play single player, thats something i was okay with after buying it on discount however even single player is unplayable due to the large number of bugs. some include your registration at the beginning meaning nothing as i had to register my myplayer about 10-15 times. then the game refused to update even after a fresh install leaving me unable to access the myplayer i had been grinding in singleplayer story mode all my time wasted, i find this unnacceptable for a AAA title in 2020 where they care so little about the game its been a known problem and there been no updates to fix it. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVEN ON SALE"

3805,"This game is not bad, but the amount of time-wasting and grinding in this game just too much to bear.

If you really really love basketball, maybe getting it at a heavy discount would be alright, you can have some fun playing it. But if you are not a die-hard fan of basketball, don't waste your time or money on this.

3813,"This game is actually fun, some people say that the cutscenes are unskippable, while there are what feels like hundreds of them to skip through, you can skip through if you hold A (or X for PS4), and i personally have never had to load for more than 5 seconds playing this game, i do have it on an SSD though. Basically it does have it bugs that feel like they could easily be patched, like the weird slow mo glitches that happen when you run past 60hz, really the only one ive encountered in my 32 hours playing this game so far. I would recommend it if you understand that franchises pumped out on a yearly basis are not perfect, and you like playing basketball games"

I cannot stress how horrible the servers are in the neighborhood and rec, If you attempt to get into a pick up game with a bunch of randoms, they're either ball hoggers shooting at every chance they can get, or have a defunct character that green lights every shot. If you're looking for a good online basketball multiplayer experience, don't buy this game"

3834,"Cinematic garbage!
I want to play a video game not watch it.  This game has endless amounts of cinematic cutscenes that are so unnecessary.  You sometimes can skip the cinematics only to go to another cutscene.

3835,"Man Like ♛MOZ♛ Short review!

A very Broken game made by a very greedy company. No changes since NBA2K17. My Career is fun but grindy as usual. Exhibition is always fun but your game can break. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"

3837,Cant play properly without a controller... don't even try my career if you can only use a keyboard. if yr like me without a controller lying around and want to fully enjoy the game(specially my career) well sad news because you cant.  but for 4 bucks? i still think its worth it.. just use the money you save from buying this game on a controller so you can play it properly. Personally i used to play nba 2k games before and was able to fully enjoy the game with a corresponding keyboard keys equivalent to an analog but now i feel like they didn't even bothered.
3838,Its fun. Im bad at the game. Right click to save changes to controls.
3839,ok

It really is as bad as they say - I only play MyCareer, but it doesn't matter. The best athletes in the world are apparently afflicted with Honey Legs, a trademarked affliction that means they move like toddlers in molasses. The cut and paste from the last iteration, which shock horror was also rubbish, is obvious. These guys used to be good, but that was a long time ago - MONOPOLIES ARE BAD.

Just for kicks - the AI isn't, it's just a cheat machine. If you are playing well and ahead but the AI decides you shouldn't be, the opposition will score 20 points in the two minutes you are off. 

Garbage game that I occasionally come back to, only to realise the depths of its inferior, faeces-encrusted degradation."

3881,"First time playing an NBA 2K game since 2K13 on the PS3. I hear people say the modern 2K games are bad, but I always thought that was a bit of an exaggeration. After playing 2K20, I can say that I can see where they are coming from. I feel like the core gameplay is flawed on some key areas. 
I have to say graphically and presentation wise the looks fantastic. But gameplay wise I feel like the game's need to feel realistic takes away a lot of fun. Team AI is atrocious, I feel like you can't rely on your AI teammates to play good defense especially in the paint. Players are too slow to simulate ""realistic"" fatigue, it ends up feeling like your trapped into what 2K wants instead of relying on skill. It makes fast breaks and help defense feel lethargic.
Which bring me to the main point about the core gameplay. I often times felt like I was trapped in animations to ""simulate"" momentum. This makes the game feel kinda like the movement in a GTA game. So like your player is still moving a bit after you've moved the analog stick, which can make for some frustrating defensive one-on-one sequences.
I also need to mention the gambling/microtransactions in the game, which is a whole other issue. I was under the assumption that once you got an player's card for MyTeam, that he was yours to keep. But nope, you have to constantly sign them to 1 or 5 game contracts to play with them. This gets in the way of fun and just another design choice to nudge gamers towards buying the microtransaction currency. 
It's a shame because I really wanted to like this game. I feel like 2K has all the money and talent to make stellar basketball games again. For now I guess I'll stick with the flawed but more fun NBA 2K11 until NBA 2K improves their core gameplay mechanics."

3902,"Game play is good, the rest of the game is complete trash.  MyPlayer takes 2 freaking hours just to get to play an NBA game and you are forced to watch literally 100+ cut scenes.  You can skip them, but my God it's the most annoying thing I have ever seen in a game.  And the story is just horrible, boring and flat out stupid."
3903,"Too many animations make the game feel so slow and clunky, like i'm fighting against my controller to move my guy. Bought for $5 after waiting for a couple months to see if i want 2k21 and glad i did before i paid full price. MyCareer had so many cut scenes where i sat for about 5-10 mins after every game to watch some terrible scripted story before i can play again. Would not recommend especially from all the other comments regarding the online game play."

3913,"In every single game I spend at least the same amount of minutes trying to skip useless cut scenes of players walking of the field, cheerleaders, coaches and stupid replays as actually playing the game.

Please insert a fast mode. This is ridiculous. I only care about gameplay so it annoys the crap out of me that the game keeps getting interrupted with useless cinematics."
3914,its ok
3915,"Absolutely destroyed the game I use to love playing. Seriously why would you ruin such a great game with lame ass unskippable stories and dialogues. When I put the difficulty in Hall of Fame my teammates are absolute trash while the opponent are almost all excellent when shooting. Seriously bruv scoring 30-40 points is so useless with trash teammates like that. Not to mention the coach keeps subbing me out in the most clutch moments. Reduce the lead to 2 points, coach subs me out, I skip hoping to go in immediately but wtf its 4th quarter and we are down by 20. Not to mention the super inconsistent shooting indicator, seriously, wtf is this bullshit indicator for, you get the same reading but so fucking inconsistent as fuck even with high progress points already.  I'm so disappointed at this game. I'm not even looking forward for the 2k21 that they keep advertising."

If you were to literally eat the money instead of buying this thrash can, believe me you would be much better of it and i am dead serious. Don't you even dare to touch it or think about it. It is THE worst NBA game that ever existed, a shame to basketball in general. I don't even know how they managed to make 2K19 look like a real life basketball simulator but here we are. You are WAY better with playing NBA2K14 (yes FOURTEEN!) and etc with updated rosters than this hot garbage. This code bunch is maybe even the worst SOFTWARE the Silicon Valley has ever made.

3991,no fun
3992,I thinks its a good game just a bit of bugs here and there not too many though maybe 1 or 2 things the only thing I didn't like about the game is the WNBA wasn't fully developed like the main game where you have full control like a multiple seasons and draft classes and created/edited female players fully and along with everything else like the male counterpart my daughter bought this game as well she likes it but was highly disappointed that the WNBA wasn't fully complete so I hope that NBA 2K21 will have a fully functional WNBA that is fully completed .

3999,"This game is highly controversial, and for good reasons. However, I believe this game is actually good and fun for the single player stuff such as MyLeague and MyCareer. I have found it a lot of fun and quite worth the $5. I havent tried the online stuff, I have seen enough bad reports to know not to get close to it."
4000,lol its 5$ fuck it
4001,MyCareer mode is great and the game overall is good but not worth €60.
4002,"The mycareer is so full of bugs its insane, im absolutely speechless on how poor this game was made. No wonder it is on sale for 95% off. I kept getting this bug in mycareer where i could not sim to next appearance what so ever, no matter how many times i quit and restarted or reinstalled the game I am not able to actually play the game. It would make me sit there and watch the full game in slow motion. fix your shit 2k"
4003,"2K sucks even worse then EA Sports does, and that's saying something.

- INgame updater that's slow and uninformative as hell without any prior notice of it being present? Check
- Character creator doesn't allow to change things once you selected them? Check
- Graphics look like they're from 1990 even with Ultra settings?  Check.

After I noticed the character and graphics issues after the absurdly long ingame update, I quitted and uninstalled and asked for a refund. FIFA football series of EA sucks. NBA 2K series of 2K Games sucks even worse (impressive considering how lazy the FIFA devs are). That even an 4 Euro game disappoints me is an achievement."

4015,can not update but myleague fun!
4016,2k20 is such a frustrating game. like it was addicting at first and the controls are super fun. but other than that its so frustrating. everytime you try to pull off a move some random crap happens and run into some stupid animation. the game is filled with slow clunky animations. it feel like the game is running in slow motion. the last time i bought 2k was 2k13 and it feels so much the same.
4017,My Career's fun tho
4018,skrt away

It constantly glitches and all the moves are controlled by a number pad, which I don't have, but I can't change the controls, because when I do, the change is not permanent.

I bought this for 5 god dam dollars and I still paid too much. 90gbs of downloads only to get a server error and discovering there is a secondary internal download of even more data which took 10mins to get to 0%. Then went to play the single player story mode and get told I need to go online to play....... long story short get it for free or don't waste your money,"
4032,"I've just had my career high in points and after a tough game I managed to get a win and my game crashes with connection error like it usually does, now it just has some bigger weigh to it. 
Such a big company like 2K doesn't care about fixing issues like this one, luckily I've bought it on discount so I don't care that much, but with this state it's not worth it no matter how low the price is."

4035,Good

4037,Trash as fuck game freezes when tryna open mycareer saves
4038,"I play these games for MyCareer, saw it on special, and even though the last one was disappointed decided to give it a shot. At first I was impressed. I loved the story, and the storytelling through the camera. The animations had improved drastically. The actual game looks pretty good too. 

Everything through that point feels great. The games themselves feel okay, the shooting isn't awful, and you can find yourself doing quite well in the NBA Summer League to finish things off. I think the story is short but sweet. Not worth it on its own, but a really big step up from 2K16 which was the last game I played.

Then you hit the NBA, and the game shows its true colours. It feels just as bad as it did before, except maybe worse. Shot timing in this game specifically is the worst I have experienced. In other games, being slightly late or slightly early meant that an open shot would almost always go in. In this game, anything but an excellent shot will almost always miss. I understand wanting to make controls precise, but this is awful. 

Next, dribbling feels super clumsy for My Player. He isn't decked out on the stats, but as a shooting guard who was a big star through your college years, you should at least expect him to be able to cross over without losing control of the ball, or do a spin dribble with some speed. But the problem is, everything you think you should be able to do, you can't.

I don't want to grind for 100+ hours to deck out my stats just so I can maybe have a little fun with the career games. I don't care for any other aspect of the game, so this was yet again, not worth it. There are minor improvements, and some major setbacks from the last entry I played. With this, and the fact that 2K is as greedy as they are with microtransactions, I don't recommend this game. It's utterly infuriating, and not in a good way. 

This game looks fantastic for a sports game, manages to create a good atmosphere for basketball fans, and has a wide variety of tasks and activities to do, but the core gameplay lacks a lot of the fundamentals of a good video game. This game is not fun unless you really want to dedicate your full time into it or pay into the microtransactions this game is riddled with."

4067,"To make this review effective I would like to say I am a poor gamer(a good friend even said playing with me on there team makes the game the 'hard mode 'hehe.I am a casual gamer.Please take that into account in reading my review and weather it can effectively  help you make a decision on this game.On to the review.
positives:I +like the addition of the WNBA (my main reason for buying this game)
                   +edit and create expansion teams and uniforms,arenas
                  +I like my career mode.(but want to play in the WNBA as well) 
                   + I like my league(but WNBA needs to be fleshed out more)
                   +I like  create a player (but again they need to add WNBA players to it) 
                    + I like the music and presentaition and other audio effects.
 And the negatives -limited WNBA features.
                               -my team seems to be mainly a cash grab.
                              - you do not seem to be able to lock on players in some important modes(practice) and it is hard to learn the game when you can lock players in some modes and not others.
                              -no game manual or in game glossary to help you learn the game 
  ---------Final thoughts--------------------------------------------------------------
This game has a lot of potential and if the make NBA2k21 add full features to the WNBA that are in NBA (create a player ,my league,my carrier ,edit uniforms,hairstyles ,faces ,(voices ?)
able to make expansion teams that you can edit arenas,uniforms ect.
I would buy it (even for 100$!  )"

-86% free throw and still bricks
-your teammate AIs can't execute a play properly
-your opponent AIs executes play beautifully
-your getting 100% smothered all the time!
-Teammate AI driving layup? Yeah right, they'll miss it anyway

4103,"First off, you have to be online constantly even to play MYCAREER which is a single player story mode. Even then, your player starts off at the worst possible stats and can barely shoot or dribble and somehow makes it in the NBA. Then, for you to level up your character, you have to grind vc coins which is made to be  as slow as possible so you get sick and tired and buy vc points to upgrade YOUR STORY MODE CHARACTER. It doesn't make any sense! What makes it worse, is the clumsy physics and character models. It feels like you have no control of your character and doing any type of drunks leaves you with little to no satisfaction. literally a 2/10 game. No care has been put into this, feels more like a beta, another ruined 2k to just trick kids into spending money on coins."

It is a frustrating game and experience. I only wanted this game for MY CAREER... and that is the most buggy experience you can get. Had to scan my face 1 million times, it crashed the game 1 million times and it still does not resemble me.

This game seems a simulator with 9k different possible action that don't work if you don't have the right stats or badges, a lot more complicated than it needs to be for no reason.

My career is unplayable offline, again, for no reason, you play 3 minutes and you listen to 3 hours of dumb speeches that seem to be straight out of a trashcan anime.

Just to justify a shop into the game they ruin your experience completely.

The game is dog****, bought it for 4 euros and I wish I didn't, you want to cheat to avoid dealing with the in game transaction bulls***? you can't in my career, you can of course in multiplayer XD

instead of making a good game we used all our resources to stop you from doing that.

You go in my career ready to play, in some games you are forced to sit on the bench for all the game, ye you can skip but its usually a 2 minutes waste of your time LOL

Teammate AI is by far the single worst part of this game."

4131,Cant even load into a game without it crashing. Not even worth the $5 I spent on it.
4132,good
4133,Yes
4134,unless if u have a good computer dont even waste your money
4135,This game is great! I got it for 92% off and it was worth it!
4136,Game kontol susah banget
4137,$5 is $5
4138,Game keeps crashing on PC port and cannot even run higher than 60fps
4139,I got this game for free and I still think its the worst 2k game in history.
4140,Good game
4141,im been playing it for a bit its pretty fun except for the error code i keep getting where im not able to start a new my career
4142,"game is booty way too big no one wants wnba stuff, rosters arent fully up to date graphics suck, optimization sucks for pc, paul george cant hit a jumper to save his life, too much vc and adds and pay to win crap, impossible to actually earn vc to get good."
4143,"This game is just bad... So bad! My Team mode is a cheap cash grab, my career mode is no more than a 15min p*rn intro with bad cutscene and nonsense-story. The gameplay is even more horrific with quacky movement animation and poor AI teamate that it looks like a huge stepback from the previous games. To be honest, I thought it's a steal when I bought this for $4 but oh no my dude, NBA 2K20 is not even worth that price.

4149,"Unfortunately this is the best up to date basketball game that's out there... but I wish it wasn't. You have to tweak the sliders tremendously to get anywhere close to an accurate basketball sim, and even then the 2K cheese is inevitable. Buy it on a sale for a few bucks, but if I were you I wouldn't give 2K any more money for another cope/paste game"
4150,"Bought for 5$.

Do not buy this craphole of a game. Wanna have a great rookie season in myplayer? Spend 50$+ so u can upgrade ur stats..

"
4151,Terrible game. Advertises it as co-op but the amount of hoops you have to jump through to play with a friend on the same time and play as your custom character is insane. Do not buy.
4152,"Iv'e only played a few hours of the game in my Career mode, but when it comes to adding attribute points, the price for VC is absolutely insane. I have not bought a NBA2k game since 2016 because nothing has really gotten any better since then. And the micro-transactions have just gotten worse. I almost feel bad at whoever paid full price for this and has to grind like crazy or pay an  exorbitant price for VC. It honestly makes no sense that you even have the option to pay for VC for a single player mode, but to have the VC drip fed to people that actually want to earn it the way that you should in a game is almost extortion considering 
 early attributes can effect your entire first season. This is beyond GTA online levels of bad."

4154,"Good NBA SIM Game

4155,"Everything is changed at the game; drills blocks and the most of the animations... but you can still have fun while playing at career mode, its worth it"
4156,"The gameplay and presentation is excellent, but most of the modes are pay to win or grind garbage. The My League mode is the lone great mode. I really enjoy being able to build and compete with my favorite team but even that's hampered by the fact that 2k20 KEEPS CRASHING TO DESKTOP FOR NO REASON!!! I'm writing this review right now after trying to play for the last hour and failing. The game has crashed 11 times in this last hour. I can't imagine how shitty this feels for people who bought this game full or half price. I got it on sale for $5 and that's pretty much what its worth. Ridiculous for a AAA title."
4157,good game
4158,"Only 7 hours in, but running into bugs stopping me from launching, from playing games, and from editing rosters without the game crashing. 

Not really fun enough to warrant continuing to trouble-shoot so I uninstalled."

4184,Worth every penny (€5 actually)
4185,I never in my life played a nba 2k game but 2k20 was on sale so I got it and tried it out and the game is good. The game is fun and with family or friends that game is better. Im thinking about getting 2k21 but people say it is ass so I might not get it. If you want to get this game get it. At the time when making this review 2k20 was 5.50 dollars.
4186,"nice game for 5 dollars
enjoying career mode"
4187,The graphics is literally same but dunno why it's seems way more demanding. the gameplay ? it's same like all the way back to 2K17 just like changing the roster and thats it. just bought this because of sale but if you will to buy this on full price when you already have 2K19 or 2K18 please just dont. totally not worth the money.
4188,"I can't play MyCareer because I have to be online, I have to be signed in to be online. I made a 2k account, linked my steam and it then the website says I don't have an account in their system. What a joke. That 92% sale was actually a bait, cos 92% of the content is gone."
4189,You have to pay to upgrade your character or try and play through an painful career/pro-am scripting against you until you give in and pay up. Their whole system is designed to shake you down.
4190,Yeah its worth for 5 bucks
4191,Love the career mode
4192,"Fun game with way too many pay walls. Luckily for me my favorite mode is myleague so it doesn't bother me as much, but the fact we can't add tattoos to a created player is pretty obvious of how they are putting  everything in  myplayer  to make us pay for it which to me is really pathetic on their part, but I do like playing the game."
4193,Paid $5 for this on sale. Not worth it.
4194,Its fun to play with yourself or with your friends.
4195,really good for 5$

4207,The graphics is way better that NBA 2k19 and its on SALE! The main reason why i bought it is I'm a big Lakers fan and AD is there coverboy for NBA 2K20.

You just get a connection error and back to menu screen :) so not even worth the $5.
4213,SO GOOD
4214,i like the overall of the game 2k never frustrates its buyer but sometimes theres a bug about the camera angle when inbounding the ball but thats the only thing i doesnt like about the game other than that nothing else

Don't bother buying this in full price, wait for discount if you really want it.

4235,"WORTH ONLY IF you are into franchise modes in sports game, because this game has an amazing Franchise/MyLeague mode, especially coming from someone who previously only played madden. This is the ultimate sports simulation game where you get to control a team, make all their decisions, and even play as the commissioner where you can change rules and add expansion teams. All 400+ of my playtime are from MyLeague, that's how good it is. I bought this game on a whim for $5 and didn't think at the time I would invest that much time in it. Well, look at how that turned out.  Now I know pretty much nothing about the other gamemodes,so you're gonna have to read another review to see how those are, but for the madden players who crave for an actual good franchise mode, BUY THIS GAME EVEN IF IT'S $60, you won't regret it. Once you buy one of these, you won't have to buy another for a couple of years cause like madden, they don't update the franchise mode that often."

4246,"The game feels sluggish in a way that whatever you are trying to do there will always be an input lag. It doesnt matter if your player has 90+ lateral quickness and defense your opponent whoever they are and no matter how slow they are will just go past by you by moving around a little bit because your character is still doing whatever input you did on your controller around 0.5 to 1 sec ago.

You can't post dunk the ball most of the time even if your opponent is about 5meters away because once your character is already done with all the delays and not important animation, the defender is already at your face.

the pace of the game is really sluggish because of all the extra animation and input lag delays. and I'm not even talking about online gameplay"

4292,"OK this is my first time writing the review for NBA 2K series.  I have played NBA 2K franchise since 2K13. So  I will give you the review from me.

Pros :
1. Updated Roster : Well this is must be the advantage of buying the original version of game than the pirate. The update well i can say that the update is often when the real NBA roster make an Update. For example, when the Player in real NBA was traded, shortly after the trade, the player will be in the new team. For me this is very useful when you playing Quick Play.

2. Easier shot meter. I don't know how the people maybe against this, but for me NBA 2K20 is easier than the NBA 2K series before. Well, I'm mostly played this game for Quick Match and I can say this point is in my pros because I almost used all of the team available (include the WNBA) 

3. The Story in MyCarrer. So in MyCarrer we played as ""Che"" who was a Captain in the Bay City Team. Somehow I love the story. 

4. MyCarrer Stat : OK maybe this is kinda weird BUT you will never increase the meter in Team Takeover while you score the most point. For me, this is very good. You just cannot make point as much as you want but if you get the point from assists or from offensive rebound the takeover meter will increase. The summary is a lot of point is not to important for takeover the team. Team Takeover for me is when you useful for the team not just be the STAT PADDER

5. Updated Team Play : Well lets make a comparison between NBA 2K20 and NBA 2K18 (i dont buy NBA 2K19 because in that time my hardware was not support). I am using Dallas Mavericks NBA roster and have very significantly different in play style (or Team Play or Run Play or whatever it is called). In NBA 2K18 you will run the play mostly in first Option is the PF position. in NBA 2K20, you will run the play more equally (equally in this meaning of all player in the court will have the same proportion of play). 

Cons (Here comes)
1. MICROTRANSACTION : well this is mostly every player will know this game as the HIGH MICROTRANSACTION. You will be know when you go to Park in MyCarrer. Almost every player has 90++ overall rating and I don't know how the hell they can be fast in increasing the overall. Well I played the MyCarrer at least 50 hour and i got 83 rating for PF.

2. NETWORK CONNECTION : oh come on, 2K fix the connection in online session. I never played so smooth in every online session (MyTeam, Park, and anything who need connection with another player). Well in my case is the connection is when I make a Shot. The Shot Meter always delay and i dont know why.

SO LETS  GO TO THE CONCLUSION :
Why you must buy this :
1. Frequent Update Roster
2. Story of MyCarrer will be different every year
3. Gameplay will be different Every Year

Why you not buy this :
1. Played mostly for online play and want to increase the overall fast by MICROTRANSACTION
2. Don't have a stable connection for Online (or at least have bad connection)

Advice
*when you play the MyCarrer, just follow the team play. If you want to be star of the team just follow it at first. Don't be hurry for be a star. Increase the minute playing by obey the team play. The easier is you must turn on the run play setting (I forgot the name) and just follow that. If you follow that, it will be a good play.
"
4293,"See all those negative reviews? Well, here's one more to add to that list.
Bought it at 90 something % discount. Still not recommended to purchase. The game is worse than every iteration of the game since my previous purchase (2k17) and that version has been worse that the version before it. 2k is literally the only developer who manages to release a new game every year that is WORSE than the previous year and still manage to sell. 

So what's worse?
-AI is even worse now, half the fucking time when you're driving your moronic AI teamates will.... run up into you, blocking you and bringing a double team. Doesnt matter if you have a full 5-out team, they will INSIST on running into you. Call a pick and they will HEDGE for the opposing team and prevent you from driving. 
-Reverse is true on defense. When opponents do a pick, good luck running through two picks, one of which might be an illegal screen done by your own teammate.
-Everything is worse. Everything is tuned to be more VC focused, and no way to earn VC easily. And even if you earn the VC well enough with enough gameplay, the gameplay itself is still shittier than previous iterations. Mycareer mode limitations prevent you from even creating NBA star level players even if you max everything out. Wont be able to recreate AD, KD, Lebron, or whatever guy you wanna play as in mycareer because ""competitive play"" which doesnt really exist because cheaters/hackers galore. 

TL;DR: bad game even at 9x% discount. Dont even bother spending 5 bucks to buy this game. I spent 5 bucks and 29 hours just so you dont have to and can instead spent it on ice cream, popcorn, or bacon. And you will definitely enjoy any of those stuff more. 
"
4294,"your players get deleted
"
4295,"Haven't really played many current gen sports games, but this does not inspire confidence in the genre. About as cashgrabby as the sims, only with the sims, at least you aren't forced into a horrible online mode, and the cashgrabbing isn't as pervasive. 

Single player mode is forced online, and everything costs VC which you can buy for real money, or spend several hours of your life trying to earn in order to come close to having a competitive chance. Everything from your character's attributes to the clothes they wear costs this currency and the kicker is they've hidden a lot of the customisation behind the online gameplay, forcing you to grind not only VD but also 'rep' points to unlock things like animations and rides and customisation options for your court. 

Basically all the fun is taken out of Single player mode, and stashed behind a paywall. Want to ride a skateboard around the neighborhood? Not only do you have to unlock it by playing online games until you grind enough rep levels, but you also have to grind about sixty to seventy thousand VC points to buy one. And the VC you get for doing things is abysmal. If you skip the story part you get placed into a team of your choosing but only make 500VC per game, without factoring in any bonuses. Otherwise you might start with something like 750VC per game. Even if you get a thousand per game that's still sixty games worth of VC you're trading in for one skateboard. Clothes cost anywhere between a few hundred to several thousands of VC, and you can't find shoes for less than a few thou. It's done this way to encourage people to pay real $$ of course, but it's infuriating nevertheless. They dangle special events and lottery spinner things in front of you, to keep you thinking and hoping you could get a big pay-out, but the most I ever won was a few hundred VC.

Then there's the team mode, and if you thought the moneygrabbing bull stopped in the career mode, you thought wrong. Instead of just letting you make a team and maybe go through a season, train the players and stuff and sort of play this sports sim, it's basically a card game where you can buy cards with (you guessed it) real money (if you want of course. You can always grind for hours and hours instead). 

There's another mode where you take control of as many teams as you want, in a league, and play up to the championship. This is like the only mode that has no online and nothing you can really buy, It's also the least polished and most time-consuming. Though it's the one that gives you the most freedom, basically. You get to edit players and their attributes and stuff, and teams, from their names to their stadiums. it's really closer to team mode than team mode is. Team mode you draw cards and pick your best ones and hope you get enough contract extensions to cover another game (because each game is a whole contract year basically, and you have each player card for a limited # of games, unless you put an unlimited contract on them, which are rare and expensive af, as you can probably imagine). 

It's not all cons, there's a few pros. The voice acting is great from most of the actors (the basketball players are about as good as you can expect, I suppose). Some characters are better than others (Isa is great. The agent is barf) though. The graphics are good and the visuals are pretty nice for the most part. The story is decent but there's a lot of cringe. Music is meh. Not my type, really, but not really bad either, apart from the odd artist I dislike. 

Overall, it's not a horrible game but it's nowhere near 'good'. The single player mode being online was a huge mistake. The VC system is ridiculous too. Lag is a big issue. But the main problem with the game is that it's just not fun. So much boring, time-consuming grinding. So much is locked away to push the VC-buying through the online stuff, which is dead anyway because of just how horrible it's implemented in the first place. 

You've barely got anybody to play with in my country and those you do find, wont touch you unless you have spent dozens of hours grinding your overall first. So before you can grind online you need to grind offline in other modes unless you want to tank your player's chances in the league for good with your terrible starting stats. It's just ridiculous.

I can't rec this game to anybody. Not even masochists.
Update: they took the servers out. That's over 9 thousand hours of grinding down the drain for me. MyCareer and MyTeam are completely unplayable."
4296,the gameplay and effects are all a level higher than the previous NBA 2K versions. also not to mention the eye-candy graphics you'll enjoy.

There's some pretty cool modes and the graphics are pretty amazing as well.  I don't even like the NBA anymore (still disgruntled Seattle Sonics fan) and I still like this game.  Especially for $5."

4312,Nice game
4313,"It's actually good, just because there is a bug / something that interferes with my career gameplay"
4314,"It's a good game if you want to play with friend or play some single player. If you want to play park on pc, don't. It's full of modders and hackers and it's not worth your time."
4315,I just a fanboy of 2k.
4316,cool!!
4317,nahh
4318,4/10 worth 5 buckeroos
4319,Honestly only get it if this is your first 2k game and if it's on sale because the next 3 games or so is just gonna be same game different rosters.
4320,was having fun with the game but started crashing on launch after maybe a weeks worth of play time
4321,"These games may be very similar every year but when this game went on sale for 5 dollars there was no pint in not grabbing it. First 2k game I have played on pc that actually had people on park too. Only bad thing is that it seems like people are glitching in the park to get characters that aren't achievable in the normal game. Other than that, right now (august 2020) is a great time to get the game since the myteam market is really cheap to get a good team without endless hours of grinding which makes it very fun to be able to hold your own without a pay wall."
4322,"game interface is very bad and its 80 gigs and the premium deluxe version is worth like 130 dollars canadian and theres in app purchases. honestly you would be happier buying an awp dragon lore cause fucks sake if you are buying an 80 dollar game or 130 for some bullshit premium version and the interface itself is already hard to control you know somethings up. goddamn ladies and gentleman this is my first 2k game and i can already tell for 3 minutes that this game is shit and the person that came up with these ideas are literal scum.

2K having a taste for money, they had the ""excellent idea"" to necessarily cross a poor online feature called ""The Neighborhood"" with the player career mode with the sole purpose of adding micro-transactions.

4377,"Even with the sale this game managed to disappoint me. I spent all my time in the game playing MyPlayer. I thought the MyPlayer story was pretty good, really enjoyed it but problems started coming once you're on an NBA team. I had a bug where the game would not simulate to your next appearance so you're forced to watch the game from the bench in real time. Apparently this problem has existed since release and a year later and they still have not fixed it. Another problem I had with MyPlayer mode is that you can only improve physical stats once per week, and it's not in-game weeks but REAL TIME weeks. Bruh 2K22 would come out by the time my player becomes serviceable.

EDIT: All the glitches were gone and the game became playable so for the sale price I got it for, it was worth it. MyPlayer's physical stats are still a weekly grind but overall, would recommend the game if it's on sale"

4400,nothing really changed an EA Classic for sport games
4401,"I bought it 92% off, kinda hard to win in the hood, if you're not at least 85 ovr, i liked the ""MyCareer"", story. ( that's what i said having 12.9 hrs in this game). Now i have ~150hrs, and i just gotta say , this game is TRASHHH, if you ever think of buying it, just don't , don't waste your money now that i think of it, i won't play this „GAME” even free. I had a pg (84 ovr), finishing at the rim was kinda fun at the beggining , scoring 90 pts per game, then it became boring, so I created a SG, scoring is hard AF , my mid range shot was full , (84), I am shooting wide open slightly late, or early, but keep missing, same thing with the 3's , finishing the match with 29% FG ain't that funny, (I had like 12 shooting badges.)"
4402,this game is one of the best sport game
4403,Frequent crashes and unbearable unskippable animations. Have to sit through every end of every half even if it's a blowout and they are just going to dribble to the end. It's actually impressive the amount of ways they found to waste your time. Paid less than 4 bucks for this game but even at this price I'm not sure it was worth it.
4404,super fun game

We finally fixed that and attempted to play each other online only to get 10 seconds into tipoff and it to tell us a problem occurred that keeps the gameplay from continuing. We both have great internet and don't have issues on any other game. I thought 2k20 was $5 because of 21 coming out but now I really see why. Sure, I'll play the single player career mode but these kind of problems really damper my thoughts on 2K. Do NOT buy unless you only want to play offline."

4426,"This game is terrible, six dollars is honestly too much for this game. 2k used to be fun and awesome however they have turned it into a fully priced pay to win triple A title that isn't even fun. There are so many issues with this game that I am shocked it even got released, for example the amount of wide open layups that are missed in this game is staggering. I honestly don't think 2k  will ever return to it's previous glory. Their priorities seem to be placed in sucking as much money they can out of you rater than making a fun and engaging video game it's a -2/10 from me"
4427,gameplay is just horrible. animations are dominating this game. defense is non existant in this game. just drive to the basket and you'll score every single time. there's no skill in this game at all. feels like you get cheated a lot by animations. just not a fun game. at least I only spent 5 bucks on this game which should be 0 dollars because it's just not as fun as 2k11
4428,good
4429,I went to play the game and every time it crashed within 1 minute. From what I've seen online they have stopped supporting updates for Nvidia drivers. I have played this on PS4 and really enjoyed it (one of my favorite sports games). For that reason and it being an amazing deal I'm keeping it. I hope one day I will be able to play it by either having the needed updates or a new graphics card. By the way my graphics card can handle this game. This is just a heads up for others out there before they buy for PC.
4430,"I once thought 2k19 was the bottom line, well, I guess 2k never stops surprising me."
4431,good
4432,All online modes are bumcheeks
4433,"fun game but its pay to win
"
4434,It's NBA2K. What more can I say? Great game with a lot of really fun mechanics. As a person who hasn't picked up 2K in a while it was extremely refreshing to see all the new features they added as well as the revamped myCareer. I can't speak for those who have loyally been buying each new instalment but I do think this is a great basketball game as a standalone title.
4435,"So I am gonna review the park aspect of the game since that's all I played.

So if you're gonna try to play park legit you are gonna have a bad time. I would say 99% of the players on park cheat and modify their stats, badges and rep. Although people do cheat to have max attributes and badges most keep their height and wingspan legit as long as you are a PG, SG, SF and PF. Centers are always 7'3 with speed and handles and if you do not have a center you will lose 95% of the time. You will run into people who modify their wingspan beyond what is possible but it doesn't happen so often and most people get off when they see one of those cheaters.

Now like I mentioned everyone modifies their rep to Legend because it gives you VIP spot if you're not in a squad. That means if you do not modify your rep you will get kicked out of your spot A LOT so be patient in finding a game or get a squad going.

Now the player base. The player is base is freaking garbage 9/10 times the people you play against are just terrible. Squad or no squad. Makes the console noobs look like they are actually decent. Because of all the cheating these trash players think they can play Park like MyCareer and just try to go through you and dunk or just spam dribbles just to miss while you never get the ball. I know it sounds the same like consoles but just imagine it ten times worse.

If your overall is not at least 90 you will get in the way and that's the honest truth maybe if your 3 is high enough to hit consistently you'll be a spot up shooter. Anything else if you don't cheat you better just give up.

If you're gonna play Park legit do yourself a favor and buy the  console version instead if you have one, if not you're not gonna have fun. Also you're gonna hear constant helicopter if you find a game which is also not fun.

Other than that the park runs smooth at 60 FPS and is way superior to consoles obviously even the gameplay.

5/10 because most online players in 2k are so bad that even with cheating they are worse would not recommend. PEOPLE CANNOT AND DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PLAY DEFENSE IN THIS GAME. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LEARN HOW TO PLAY DEFENSE. SOME PEOPLE ARE SO DUMB THEY LEAVE THESE CHEATERS OPEN ALL DAY AND THEY DRAIN 3's NON STOP SO IF YOU LIKE LOSING GET THIS GAME."
4436,"A few days after paying $130 for this game, it goes on sale for $6. Upon signing up and trying a sports game for the first time on PC i entered age incorrectly due to barbaric keyboard commands and unfriendly user interface for PC users without controllers. This seemingly minor mistake cost me the ability to play or experience the game online without sending in a ticket to 2k directly which was so frustrating i gave up on. It was much easier to refund the game and uninstall than to continue wasting time trying to contact support. I didn't even have the opportunity to experience this game because of how flawed it is on the PC. I mean hitting escape doesn't even bring up a single menu. I don't understand how a PC game made on a PC with a PC can be so choppy and hard to navigate with a PC. Save your money for a company who isn't purely interested in emptying your wallet."
4437,Not even worth the 3 bucks I paid for it during sale. Feel so bad for the people who paid full price for this pile of trash.

4460,the Game is alright but i believe that they strayed from a genuinely fun game that you can pull off ridiculous things in to a hardcore simulation where everyone airballs a shot if they are even a tad bit contested. why does putting the difficulty up drag your shot chances down they should just make the cpu get better progressively instead of making your team trash. Anyway the game is on super sale so just buy the 5 dollar game.
4461,"Yes
"
4462,I actually had fun playing this game. But closing the servers without warning and effectively crippled all game modes is infuriating. I would never recommend 2k games to anyone. You invest money and time playing it only to be ghosted. An absolute waste of money. I regret buying this game.
4463,"Nice Game , Give You A feel that you are a real player."
4464,Nice  gameplay!!

4466,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVER FOR $4.80.... slowest player reactions of all time even when playing the top teams. shooting is dumb. ball moves or skill moves  are so damn slow. crazy the old games were so much better and i used to play like 2k05 and shit. they do a good job of showing 0 gameplay

In myCareer simulate until your subbed in is broken, which means that you either have to watch the ENTIRE game from the bench until you're subbed in or you have to Alt+Ent/Alt+Tab multiple times to trick the game into simulating the game... FFS this is a multi-year franchise with a huge budget yet it's broken..."
4488,gud game
4489,Worst NBA game to date. I hope they stop the microtransactions before they destroy the entire franchise. Won't be picking up 2k21 on principal.
4490,"- My carreer mode is still bugged in august 2020 (rly??), every game press ALT+TAB multiples times if you want to play (watch the game in slow motion if not...), player get stucked after a possession, etc etc etc... 
- If you don't pay for VC, the game becomes Farming NBA simulator (in my carreer at least)

i played a lot of 2k since 2k14 on consoles, this one is the last i ll buy

if it's your first basketball game go for it, you will not find a better one (simulation), if you played a lot of 2k years before, worth 3€, not really more"
4491,"this game is so bad for a pc
"
4492,If you have lags in this game and you have a powerful laptop it is not because the game is not optimize for your laptop it is because for default this game use wrong graphics card and you must change it to the must powerful one for example this game start with Intel graphics card that is weak and it is not for running high graphic games. i choose Nvidia graphics card for my default graphic card to run this game and game is now runs smoothly
4493,it good
4494,"The worst NBA game ever, a ridiculous money grab, if i did spend the full money on it I would be crying now. Your player is so slow at the beginning and practically running into a wall when there is an opposing player around. They want you to buy VC to upgrade, is ridiculous. Don't buy it people, it is the only way to show 2K they are bad developers and delivered a crappy product."

If you answer no to any of the above then this game is not for you, tbh this game is not even worth the $5 i pay for it during sale

More cons:
- graphic not an update
- when playing my career and trying to SIM the game until your controlled player get on the court, it takes too long to get to the SIM screen
- in order to access your own court to practice shots in my career mode you have to go to the online session to do so
- the shooting is still unpolished, stopped moving to hold the button to shoot sometimes doesn't register"

4507,"The my player creator is really nice and a big improvement from last year. The new in game UI and VFX are much better, on court gameplay improvements with more realistic boundaries where you cant just keep running and expect to be blocked in by the boundaries. Shooting is pretty much the same but pullup jumpers are noticeably smoother, the transition between running and pulling up for a shot isn't as mechanical/blocky and noticeable as it was last year. Would have been nice if they used Dwade in game somewhere"
4508,Great game.  Much more difficult than previous years but worth the challenge
4509,"For 3£, yes, it is worth it, for anything else, the game just isn't good. 
It is the same thing that was released 4 years ago. rebounding is still an issue, passing is an issue.
so many things wrong with this game. glitches and delays. 
If you are a fan, buy it on sale like I did, otherwise leave it and hope another company get the NBA license."

Sports are never going to get better until people stop handing money over hand and fist. I bought this as a key for a very low price, but its still not worth what I paid."

4522,I bought this game for $4.80. Im not even going to give it another chance and just refund it. Its terrible and i do not enjoy it.
4523,Game hasn't evolved in years.  Shooting is still trash and players move like they are in mud.  Not fluid at all.  Having to get a perfect release anytime to hit a shot is stupid.  I am glad that I paid less than $5 for this piece of shit.

4560,"ya know, I bought this game for $4 and was really enjoying it. I mostly bought it for myCareer, and got about 3-4 hours into my playthrough and was getting decently immersed. and then, all of a sudden, I get drafted by a team and get into the NBA, and the game won't let me simulate when my player isn't on the court. if I want to be able to simulate the game to the point that I can ACTUALLY PLAY IT, I have to tab out of the game 5-6 times and then it will suddenly give me the option. when you start the game, you are just a shitty scrub that sits on the bench because you have like 60 overall rating. so essentially, I spent $4 on a brick because anytime I want to play the myCareer mode, I get to play for about 1-2 minutes before I'm subbed out and have to start trying to force the game to actually work like it should. 

I've tried all of the fixes I've seen online. none of them work, in fact they just tank the game down to about 10 fps.

the devs over at 2K games are actually genius, because I have to spend about 4 hours going through pointless dramatics just to be drafted and actually start getting subbed out. so this issue is not even apparent until after you cannot refund the game. fuck this game, fuck the devs for allowing this to still go unpatched for over a year, and fuck the Lakers. this is what will cause people to start pirating your shitty games."
4561,"Glad I only paid 6$ for this pile o' crap. Game play feels like you are swimming through mud and your team runs  just about as fast. The whole experience is frustrating due mainly to the sluggish, sloth like speed of even the fastest my player. Overall I would give it a 2/10"
4562,ok
4563,vary vad
4564,"This game is one of the worst games i have played this year, if not ever. MyPlayer can't hit wide open slightly late/early shots with a 70 overall, but another player with a 60 overall can hit 70% contested shots. I really want to know where is the logic in this game because so far after many attempts i have failed to find it. Every team plays with the ball very selfishly not willing to pass to me while im open in paint. Every time i ask a player to pass the ball to me, i get ignored with no obvious reason behind it. As an examle, Trae Young can hold the ball for 8 seconds with nothing happening and he causes no violation, but if i hold it for 8 seconds, i get 6 different violations and my score goes from C to F+. Hitting a green shot is rarer than your parents buying you a Bugatti for your 16th birthday. Defense of the AI is non-existent. If i go for a layup i get guarded by the whole team like im a national threat with a bomb in my hand meanwhile a SF from the opposite team can score a 3 while being wide open because why not. The AI teammates block you while you are trying to get to the player you are guarding while he is moving at 300 miles per hour and then its your fault and you get a defensive breakdown. Upgrading your player does as much good as drinking acid. The movement is garbage, the animations are trash, and i could very well see why Ronny 2K would sell the game for 4 euros. I am honestly surprised at why would new players buy it. Even 4 euros is expensive for a game thats about as good as a game developed by a rookie programmer. I mean hey there must be a few positives right? Sike you thought. If this game is ""good"" then im also 8 foot 9 irl. I dont know why i thought that it would be a good idea to purchase this game. I am still in disbelief because of my poor decisions. I could have bought 2 large chocolates and it would have been a better investment. At least i wouldve enjoyed the chocolate. Fuck this game and everything it stands for. Suck the right side of my left nut 2K."

So if a few years later, the servers are brought down due to its age or lack of players, it will make this game unplayable.

This would've been my very first 2K purchase ever since Dreamcast era. Keyword ""would've"" since I'm getting a refund even with the 92% sale!!!

4581,"Got it for like 4$ and i still regret it. My Career is just plain boring. Loadings, unskippable cutscenes, unskippable animations (f.e during draft combine) , ADVERTS  during loading screens (NOT ONLY THEY MADE IT ALMOST MANDATORY TO BUY VC TO SKIP THE GRIND THEY ALSO PUT F****** ADs IN A GAME WHICH COSTS $60 AT THE PREMIERE) and i can go on but i just don't wanna waste my time anymore on that ""game"". It's just not fun. I won't even talk about microtransactions because this year they just went beyond themselves. Listen... i have like 4k hours in Black Desert Online MMO and most of it was grind... but grind in NBA 2k is just so boring, and oh so unrewarding. No one should buy it."
4582,good game
4583,tall brown man throw thing at other thing and white people like it.
4584,"I wasn't going to get this, but, at 92% discount, it was cheaper than a slice of pizza. 

It's 2K19 with small changes, some for the better. What I liked the most is that now we have a visual clue when the ball is less protected and we can steal it without fouling. Also, in MyCareer you can choose what badges you'd like to unlock after you've gathered enough points to earn one. 

And there's the addition of the WNBA _ but since I only play MyCareer and MyGM, I probably won't play with/against those teams, so for me it's a useless change, although a welcome one. 

The worst is the lack of good stories in the offline modes. The prelude to MyCareer is short and bland, despite a good performance by Idris Elba; in 2K19, there were more characters and way more drama _ now, we've barely any journey. Also, in 2K19 MyGM had a long and also dramatic story, and now there's none! And we could create a team from scratch (I'll miss the Bronx Hard Ones, with Pickle Rick as logo); now you have to choose from one of the real-world franchises. Boring.  

It's also weird that we get accolades notifications during the games, but they're nowhere to be seen afterwards. 

I only recommend this during this deep sale, if, like me, you don't care about playing online, you're sick of 2K19 and you're not interested in 2K21 (maybe I'll get it a year from now, if it costs the same as a subway round trip; otherwise, I'll have pizza).

[i]Edit:[/i] One month after launch, 2K21 was already at 35% discount, something unheard of. It's almost December 2020 and the Neighborhood in 2K20 is still pretty populated, not that hard to play online matches (it wasn't the case for 2K19 after its sucessor came out). Maybe 2K will have to shake things around for 2K22 _ I hope so. No point in buying almost the same game every year...

[i]Edit 2:[/i] 2K21 was given away by another store and it's not worth it if you already have this one or 2k19 _ it's almost the same game, with less things (this time the Pre-Game Show was dumped) instead of additions (the new Neighborhood is the old one with things moved around, just to make it more confusing)."

You are yet again a hot talent. 
Still you start in the game with a 64 rating or something. Speed like a snail.
I picked a PF. He dunks almost no times. Even when being all open.
Other talents that start in the game get rating 75. Why always the same crap ? 
To make us grind. I hope there will come a nba live gameplay game with good carreer.

And then there is the unbreakable defense wall. When the defense can touch you with their hand it is like you can't go past them. Seems there is a invisible arc around them. When in that zone, you can't got past or push trough. 
Same crap as 2 years ago.

Doesn't seem like the devs or 2K actually care about getting these issues fixed, so if you are okay with playing a game that is still broken, do so!

Sure this 2020 game should have amazing photo realistic graphics and real life-like animations, and that's already something. And we could play it with my mates when they're hanging out at my place"".
Boy was I wrong.
Firstly, it's ugly. I mean it's real ugly, I cannot comprehend how a game which only needs to render one room can be this bad visually.
Secondly, animations are not that good either. Movement does not feel fluent, player models going through each other, movements skipping frames, player faces resembling dead fish etc.
And all that could be fine for such a price, but
Thirdly, there is no way I can just boot up the game on my pc and play it with a friend on a couch. Why would I need a sports game that won't allow me that? It's insane that somebody paid full price for this pile of ."

Been an on and off fan of the 2k series for years and know that you start of not the best player, so I bought $10 VC so i could max out my shooting to earn more VC and still continued to miss shot after shot, when I wasn't being guarded at the logo. I know badges play a role in game but at a 90+ shooting in all three ranges i should not be missing wide open shots. 6 games in and I'm over it. 2K should take the $10 I spent and give it to the devs to pay them to actually play this game and fix their flaws.

4654,"Where to begin,

This game is so bad.  The AI teammates on MyCareer are so bad that it is impossible to get any assists and they don't play any defense.  The opposing team is insane on defense.  Not balanced at all and ruins the experience.  F  this game"
4655,How bad do you have to be as programmers to not even make a game which can update without being on? Is it just to get closer to that two hour mark so people don't ask for a refund once they notice how incomplete the game is by being loaded with micro transactions. I loved played 2K games as a kid but this is just pitiful. Everyone associated with this game should be fired then have an entire new dev team hired. Also is this any different from NBA2k19 except having more micro transactions???

4664,"easy to navigate interface and awesome story line, love the customisation options and being able to fine tune your myplayer to be exactly the way you want."
4665,"the core basketball gameplay in nba2k20 is phenomenal (even though it doesn't seem to have been updated in the last 3-4 years), but the player experience is trash.

nba2k20 does a great job at the core gameplay- the controls are tight, simple, and easy to learn but hard to master. the in-game presentation is done well. the graphics are a bit dated for 2020, but still passable.

however, my not recommended comes from virtual currency and multiplayer. single player is a huge grind to get anywhere decent- you'll get absolutely schooled by the cpu for 20ish hours if you don't want to spend money. and of course there is the myteam mode which is literally gambling/pay to win unless you want to grind 20-30hrs to pick up usable cards. the multiplayer modes on pc are fairly dead and roughly half cheaters, not even worth attempting.

if you love the nba and don't mind a huge grind or paying extra, check this game out. if you just want a fun sports game, skip this and check out something like pyre or rocket league."

4680,"good game i am the best

4681,"Really not accessible to new players. As someone who knows a bit about basketball, picking up a 2k game was infuriating... Difficult control scheme makes no sense to me... I haven't played 2k in a few years, and it doesn't seem that different. Just disappointing really."
4682,"I bought this at the 90% off sale time but do not let that fool you this game will cost you quite a bit more and it will all be in vain.

Graphics - It is a one year old game which looks okay at ultra. As a PC player expect Console quality graphics.

Music - I am not a fan of these tracks but some of them are decent and none of them are too bad.

Controls - The controls may not be the worst part about this game but they are horrible. I use a wireless Xbox One controller but I've tried wired as well and it will always feel like your playing truck simulator rather than in the NBA. I could understand the tilting and skidding and floating if it was at least realistic. The AI defense simply floats around blocking your every attempt to get in. They have some kind of speed boost making your defending trash against them.

Fun - No this is a nice game that becomes tedious when you realize there is a business model to why your character is so trash.  I recognized it because I've played a lot of MMORPGs so it's familiar. Your character has semi hidden stats that level up over time. You also have the obvious stats that you can pay real money to increase. 

I spent $30 on this game total and got through the my career portion of the game despite some of the retarded work out mini-games.  When you get to the NBA those hidden stats become so damn pronounced with every even Centers running circles around you. What's more the hidden attributes of the AI forces you to miss shots even if they are 6ft away from you because they have intimidater. 

Breaking the AI ankles even with 75 handling, 50 lateral movement and 80 post movement is impossible with the hidden stats being considered. It isn't that the AI is that good, it's just that your character rolls like they had hip replacement surgery this morning.  Couple that with that everyone simply goes faster than you and you have people who are past the half court catching up to you on the paint before you can complete a half roll to lay up.

These hidden stats makes for the experience as a player totally new to NBA 2k completely unfun and more frustrating than anything else. It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the obvious buy gold coins options to make your character stronger option at the upgrade screen.

Conclusion - If you are new to 2k like I am I cannot recommend this game even at the 90% off rate. This is not the sport game for you - there is no tutorial mode or any hand holding even on rookie difficulty. If that's your jam then good luck - the reward of winning a game isn't even there because I gain 5% or less xp per game as I can't make 3's, can't make inside shots, can't dribble, can't pass correctly 5v5 (Whole other issue here), can't defend, and can't have fun. 

Perspective - I am coming at this game for the experience of playing a NBA game and being a player - it's more like an RPG for me, what I got is something that takes itself FAR too seriously as a tournament game and is built assuming you mean to play it competitively.  I have no intention of playing online or going against other people. Because of that this game is not for me."
4683,Very Nice!
4684,good
4685,"same game as 2k14 tbh
Worse servers, 95% of the time they aren't working(i'm on fiber)
Pay2Win 
same bugs as 2k14,15,16,17,18,19
2k wants the money but doesn't put any effort into the game.
I'm sorry for the devs that 2k doesn't give a flying fuck about the game"
4686,ngl gei game but for 4€ why not
4687,Game full of ballhogs and quitters @ park. pretty sad and not enjyoing the gameplay
4688,love this game always
4689,bad game
4690,"It's cool. Liked it a lot. Don't understand the reason people are complaining on myCareer mode. Yes, you need VC to upgrade. You can buy it, but if not, you can grind for it. Be good, play better, get your grades up, and you'll get a lot of them in no time."
4691,"At first, i didn't like the game (My Career). I was playing NBA Live before....not the same...and finally after 15-20 games i was able to play and score and understand the game mechanics! I have fun everytime i play. The My Career story is very nice and all the stuffs with the players is nice. It's a 10 / 10 for me. Can't wait to play NBA 2K21 . Hope it's gonna be awesome like that one."
4692,Trash game. Bring back the early 2000's 2k please. Ads ads ads and more ads. Cheerleading timeout breaks are a waste of time that you can't skip it. Game freezes in my career when loading games or practice. MyCareer players growth is a waste of grinding time. MyTeam is a poor man's version of Madden's MUT which EA should sue 2k Games stealing their idea.
4693,One of the worst games I have ever played.
4694,I like the My League features. Nice simulation but the stats get a little messed up.
4695,it has to many hackers and at first its funny but then you literally can't get a game and when you do they are either totally trash or crazy at the game either way you lose because they have every badger in the game 0/10 not fun at all
4696,ed

4702,"This is my first ever NBA 2k game and from a first experience it is horrible.  The online is extremely laggy, buggy, and full of hackers.  Animations are inconsistent and unrealistic (dunks from super far, buggy animations, etc.).  Also, if you're not at least a 90 overall or above, don't expect to even be able to play neighborhood games (assuming you don't get into a game with hackers).  Also, I pray for your ears every time a legend joins your neighborhood session, just saying.  Overall, a laggy, buggy, inconsistent pay-to-win sorry excuse for a NBA 2k game, let alone a 2019 title.  Better luck on 2k21 hopefully."

4710,many errors
4711,"best game ever
"
4712,nice
4713,"This has to be the least enjoyable sports game I've ever played. What's more, I wanted to play a sports game, not a frigging online casino, because that's really what this turd of a game is really all about. If you genuinely want to get anywhere playing MyCareer, that's right, you need to buy VC. In fact, everything in this game literally revolves around microtransactions. Never again, they can kiss the crack of my beautiful behind, because I won't be buying another 2K product."
4714,Pay respect for those who bought this game 1 day before 92% discount
4715,"The game is only worth when you buy it at 90% discount.

Otherwise, don't bother. Really, don't bother."
4716,垃圾游戏 进游戏更新不了叫我们怎么玩！！
4717,i mean i got for like 5 dollars still worse then 2k19 and that game was trash
4718,"bad
"
4719,GREAT
4720,"I've only played the myplayer campaign so far, and a little bit of mypark but i think its an improvement from 2k19's. I haven't played the Team mode or anything else yet, so i won't be reviewing it.

Pros
-It controls very similarly to 2k19(atleast with a controller)
-The customization has increased with the new mybuild system
-It feels like you get more VC in the story( i was on pro and was getting 600-700 vc per story mission)

Neutral
-The myplayer story is very short.(beat it in less than 9 hours)
-The achievements can only be unlocked after beating the story(which isn't so bad i guess due to it being short).

Cons
-The cutscenes so far can be very long(one of the first ones was 12 minutes).
-The potential system or whatever it's called makes it so if you didn't set your potential for certain attributes, then you can't increase them at all
-The graphics really didn't improve much
-It took a while to actually get a decent FPS, i had to switch graphics cards and change my computers mode to high performance to get 60 FPS on ultra(which i dont usually have to do).
-Hacking is very easy to do it seems. I've ran into several people that were hacking(some had stretched bodies which was funny), only experienced this in mypark though.



I'd say the game is worth it for $4.80, considering 2k19 is going to be dead soon. I'll update the review with more once i play the online and league."
4721,for 5 bucks... worth!
4722,F in chat for those who payed 50 euros
4723,really loved the story line with the gameplay graphics are perfect no complaints difficulty should be a lil easier havnt found any training mode yet but not too hard to learn got it for 5 bucks cant wait till the next ones this cheap
4724,Bought it on discount for 2 euro.  F for the boys that bought it for the full price.
4725,i can feel the homosexuality entering my body after buying this game
4726,"Trash fucking game, no point in having ranks when you get matched with legendary cucks and you have no chance playing against same skilled players."
4727,Nice Game
4728,most bugged game ever player
4729,"Pre-determind games, glitchy myTeam moves that are toxic. IO love basketball so it wasnt terrible.. but a frustrating exp all round,"
4730,this game is unplayable unless you have a controller. First you make controls for your keyboard and the game resets it. In the menus you cant use anything. neither team picking nor other things
4731,this game is trash on pc get it on concole
4732,its shit

4742,Fun
4743,God im an idiot if i waited another month or two i coulda had this garbage game for only 5 bucks
4744,"these games could be so good if they stopped wasting 90% of their budget on bullshit cinematics and narratives for the mycareer THAT NO ONE WANTS and spent it on shit that would actually make the game better. dumb as fuck teammate AI allowing wide open shots in the paint because they don't know how to guard. bricking wide open shots because you were ""slightly early/late"" on the release. dropping the ball for no reason because clunky and unresponsive character movement animations. I could go on for hours with everything wrong with these games. this garbage isn't worth a $5 sale."
4745,"Pros: 
 + Worth 5$ 
 + Has NBA players
 + a lot of mode 
 + MMO 
 + Shoes customize
Cons:
 + Floppy ass offline plays
 + Floppy ass online plays
 + P2W, hackers
 + Cheap ass 99 players all over the market 

It's will be fun if this is your 1st nba 2k game"
4746,"Regret that i bought it 95k, now its just 50k"
4747,"It is very optimised, but if you want to play Park, good luck with that if you're in Asian servers as they are dead af. Otherwise, I play it on PS4 and have more than 1000 hours on it because servers are full on console. Also, if you don't have a controller you can play with, dont get it."
4748,"For 92% off, heck yeah! Who cares about my team? Split-screen is where it's at! $4.80 baby!"
4749,not too bad
4750,Amazing game worth its money!
4751,it's okay
4752,"The game could be really awesome.. it had a lot of potential.. but it's not... The MyPlayer mode is very good but the games in the park are really really really terrible... Either there are too many cheaters or there are too many bugs (if it is something else please tell me). I'm not a pro player but it's not remotely possible that in 9 out of 10 games AT LEAST one of the following happens

- a 6""2 PG dunks over a 7footer with 90+ Inside defence and Blocking 
 -a 7footer paint beast/glass cleaner or a slasher with less than 40 in 3P shooting scores from long range (and I don't mean a..fluke one! Sometimes they have consecutive green releases). 
- a 6""11 paint beast with 90+ inside scoring and 98 standing dunk misses from underneath the basket because somebody is...standing nearby and perhaps (not always) has the ""Intimidator"" badge. Sometimes the paint beast gets rejected by the...aforementioned 6""2 PG. 


I know it's a video game in which everyone has the opportunity to...become like their favourite NBA player and some...creativity is more than welcome, but this is..science fiction. 

Of course playing skill should play a big role in the game, but ratings and..logic should also. Otherwise, maybe just take out ratings  and let everyone play depending on their skill"
4753,"Game is OK, but the NBA2K online system is the worst, error after error and my connection keeps on breaking up.

4761,"No wonder this game was on sale. It's soooooo bad. So many bugs, and this so called ""revolutionary character creation system"" is actually a waste of time."
4762,"This games Input lag in of itself is about half a second with a dropped input on menus every 30 or so inputs, then it makes the players slow as absolute balls and need a whole second and a half animation just to start to move. Its so clunky and hard to control in any intended way as far as i can tell. it was barely worth 5 dollars. im going back to nba2k14 when you could play defense."
4763,Lebron James is the cause of all the world's problem
4764,"nice game, very real"
4765,"NBA2K IS THE ONLY basketball game out there!!! I don't  care what anyone says, every year it gets better. STILL GLITCHY here and there but most games are. I cannot wait for 2K21...i hope the grind is different though!!!!"
4766,i like nba so.
4767,Fun game. I like the MyCareer. Way to many microtransactions though
4768,"Boring, boring aaaaand boring."
4769,This game has an insane amount of gamebreaking and punishing bugs. The grind is real and focused on milking you for microtransactions. I would probably only buy this if its under $5.

4785,Cool game
4786,"I want to preface this noting that I bought this game on sale. I gave this game a positive review only because I'm not someone who tends to rage about the Park experience or multiplayer modes. Most of my time spent in game is in singleplayer MyTeam or the MyCareer storyline. I can understand the community's frustration with the lack of attention us PC players get, as well as the problems with the multiplayer experience and cheating issues. 

Overall, I enjoyed this game more than 2k19 and I'm hoping to enjoy 2k21 better than 2k20."
4787,not worth £3.. pay to win shite
4788,bad game
4789,trash.
4790,"Just play it for myleague and playerlock myleague instead of mycarreer's money grubby tactics. it's fine for that, but don't bother with online or mycarreer in this game unless you want to spend 100's of $$$"
4791,"For 5 dollars, why not?"
4792,"I  bought the game for nothing just cause it has nike jerseys (played 2k15 before). The only mode I'm interested in is My Career. I spent more 100hrs playing two different characters. Recently 2K disable the server which is necessary to access MC, so my bois are just gone. Absolutely disgusting. [strike]Sosite[/strike] <3

(Career in the 2k15 still working)"
4793,Great game for the solo player. If you are looking for a good co-op/multiplayer experience look elsewhere. The online experience is absolutely terrible. I am unable to play this game online with friends because they just straight up disconnect before every online match. My friends and I spend more time on trying to figure out how to not disconnect than actually trying to play the game. It feels bad when the developers designed a game with awesome gameplay but failed implement the multiplayer experience properly.

I'm so pissed."
4799,"As a huge fan of the League who's never played a quarter of real basketball in my life, 2K20 is as real as it gets. The learning curve is pretty steep for players new to the franchise like me, but there are more than enough resources to get your feet under you only a Google away. The in-game currency VC is fairly easy to come by, but the prevalence of micro-transactions is obnoxious and a definite stain on the game. 

Would recommend for anyone new to the franchise, basketball fans, and players alike."
4800,"Who bought the game for a 92% discount?
Press F who bought it at full price."

4806,"With no ability to have mycareer storymode offline the game is ruined.
Its just like FIFA, 1 year and a new edition come out then all your purchases are obsolete. You mycareer is obsolete.
Then 2 years from your purchase they will take down there support for your online server and you lose everything. No offline play and 50% of the game not accessible.
NBA 2K is way too expensive if its a 1 year full game and a 50% game offline. 2 Years on when the server is not supports its worth nothing.
When server support ends they should unlock offline mode and support there community.

4824,I wash shocked an appalled at how pay to win every single game mode was. Even MyPlayer is full of it now. I hate that your MyPlayer is paid with tokens that are used for upgrades (that you can buy more of in the store) instead of player payment and  upgrade points being separate.
4825,"Terrible game, I played 6 hours then the game wouldnt even let me play Career mode because of an update glitch and there is no fix that anyone is aware of, what a waste of money."
4826,"What a trash can of a game. These games get progressively worse every year. They use their entire budget for this cheap ""story"" experience that the actual game plays like a potato. 92% off the price is still not enough of a discount. Maybe focus on a better gameplay experience rather then this soap opera called my career, and then maybe the reviews wouldn't be so dogshit"

4828,I picked this up for $5 and I still feel ripped off. 2K12 was the last greatest 2k game
4829,"It's 2020 and you need to run this game capped at 60fps with vsync on to be able to play the game without random crashes, unskippable bench times and weird slow mo bugs. If you're willing to get your wallet out, you can deck out your character in MyCareer instantly. Haven't played online and wasn't looking to anyways. Sadly, this is the best basketball ""sim"" out there.

This is why monopolies are bad, kids.

Edit: I've been running it at 60fps capped and with vsync and I'm still getting crashes. I bought the game for $3 and I'm still complaining -- I can only imagine how people who paid full price might feel.

Pressing the biggest F to pay respect for them."
4830,"Only playing MyCareer , it's the best story they've managed thus far. looks good plays ok."

NBA 2k 10 to NBA 2k12 were probably the primes years of NBA 2k.. RIP to NBA 2k"
4852,2k just keeps getting worse every year. All they care about is making more money
4853,"Well, I grabbed the game on sale for $4.  I never thought I could feel ripped off buying a brand new game for only $4 but here we are.

I've been playing 2K on PC for a while now, any anyone who has played this game on PC before knows...that MyCareer and any other online modes are basically non existent on 2k.  As I said on my review of 2k19, you're basically buying half of the game as you can only play MyGM and MyLeague.  MyCareer on PC is either empty, or filled with hackers.  

Anyway, I'm really only a MyLeague player so that's where my review is coming from.

It's a roster update.  A complete copy and paste from 2k19.  Literally the only three differences I can see are 

1) The homescreen looks different
2) A new animation under the player when you green a shot
3) some new transitions and animations 

Anyway, the game itself plays fine and if you love basketball sims it's the best (and really the only).  But the fact that they thought they could sell this copy and pasted version of 2k19 for $60 is beyond me lol.

All in all, it's a terrible excuse of an installment in a franchise, but a good game for MyLeague/MyGM gamemodes. With 2k21 dropping soon, it's basically a roster update and a 1 year extension of server life. 


"
4854,Very fun if you like Basketball. It has many different things you can do in it.
4855,go celtics
4856,"This is a terrible game. I wanted and tried to like it but it is just bad and it does nothing really well. The menus/plays often reset so you have to set everything back up over and over. I uninstalled it and would not be willing to pay $10 for the game as I will never reinstall it or ever play it again so actually I guess, it is not even worth it if the game went on sale for $1. It is that bad!"
4857,I like it but files get corrupted and the game crashes without any error pop-up afterwards.
4858,This game is ass
4859,"Just to get the obvious out of the way: 2K is a greedy, scummy company and micro-transactions are trash. But I got this game for $4 and since the game is EOL, all the good MyTeam players are quite cheap and 2K is literally throwing other good players at you. I haven't spent a penny more than what I paid for the game and I already have a handful of 95+ players and a lot of 90+ as well. If you are interested, check out the locker codes currently available for the game. I got 750 tokens which translated to about 12 Ruby players, a few Amethyst players, and a couple diamond ones as well. 

Mechanically. this game is good. Good defenders actually feel like proper stoppers and blow-bys are much harder to achieve than previous games. Athletic players show their colors in ease of getting to the hoop. There are still janky animations and players still get locked into animations with some frequency but overall it's a solid basketball game. Hopefully the new NBA Live games come to PC so 2K has some actual competition."
4860,An interactive MyTeam mode with an active community proved to really keep my interest. A great party game that anyone can enjoy! Would recommend.
4861,The most garbage sports game I have ever played. In game Audi advertisements were the final straw. Absolute trash.
4862,"Worst thing I have ever played.
Lets put all the gameplay aside for a second and talk about the constant crashing of this piece of shit game, if you want to play any kind of online game mode, get ready to crash every 3 mins. Latency still a thing on PC and its not even much better, not to mention 2k is just an overall unfinished and trash game with lots of cheese mechanics. 
I got this game for $5 and I want my money back so I can buy a burger.

4863,Best game to play with the homies
4864,"I got it for $5 and I still feel kinda ripped off. Completely ignoring the microtranactions, it is just a poorly made game. The graphics, stability, and gameplay are all below average. I love basketball but not enough to put hours into this game."

4879,"Only bought on pc to mess around with modded rosters, wouldn't really reccomend to anyone personally, game itself is very stale and in need of a revamp with predatory gambling systems embedded into almost every facet of the core gameplay experience, as well as not working on much more than polish in terms of gameplay innovation in almost a decade."
4880,"I spend 4$ on this game and it pains me i could spend them on something else. I thought ""hey, it's only 4$, they can't fuck this up to the point game will not be worth this price"". I forgot 2K is chasing EA to be the worst publisher, because they made me regret this purchase. The only people i can recommend this game to are probably gambling addicts because of MyTeam.

Edit: So i played a bit more, this time in MyCareer so gambling is reduced to 0. I will admit, I had fun playing this mode, until 1 hour ago when error 04d8c39c that exists since the launch and multiple people have issue with made my game unable to load. I could send a ticket to support but apparently it takes around 3 weeks for them to reply assuming you are lucky and they will reply at all. Summarizing, one game mode is just a tool to drive kids into gambling addiction and second mode is pretty fun but is not working. At this point i don't know if I want to check MyLeague."

I like to Create teams like make a kansas city team and fantasy draft and go do stuff like that so if you are like me , buy it on sale and enjoy because really i feel like 2k20 is the game with the least amount of bs during gameplay , it flows good , i havent seen glitches like the others real bad and honestly i feel its the best one so far ,  ASIDE from the Online stuff here on pc ,  other than that its awesome!"

This game does a good job of making you feel like an nba star and honestly i havent felt this way since 2k5. man did i love that game. 8/10. grinding is necessary but waaaaaay less than you'd expect. 25 hours in and you'd have a decent 80 overall character. soft max is 85."

The amount of glitches I can run into a game is crazy for 20+ years if 2K sports. A worse copy/paste version of NBA 2k19.

I understand wanting updated rosters, but there's no need to buy one every year. I played park maybe twice this year but between the lag outs and the hackers, it was fairly alright, mostly only went to the park for new clothes to use against friends in the MyCourt. The game performed fairly well never had any issues except not being able to play blacktop online a few times. MyTeam is still the same as every year, MyCareer is okay, MyLeague and MyGM continue to be the same. It's just as I said, its an updated roster with minor tweaks here and there."
4946,"Look, I get that I might be new to the game and not great at the controls. However, there's no reason that I should be missing as many shots, wide open, as I did with the MyPlayer thing.

4950,You don't have a choice in NBA games so it's as good as it gets unfortunately. Little bugs with inaccurate stats seem kind of odd for such an established game.

4960,"Utter trash and money grab.

My previous review was about how good this game is with only major flaw being sheer difficulty. You either pay to win or you grind for hours (like 100+ hours) and then you win.

But now I finally got relatively good at it and started wining, and found out the flaw I can't forgive. It is scripted AF. 

I'm playing with Bucks, season is going well, 52-9. Only now I realize that those 9 loses came from teams that are considered strong stat-wise - Lakers, Clippers, GSW etc. meaning those loses were scripted. I've come to realize it after a loss we just had from Lakers.

We were playing hard and I was working my arse off, but we lost.

I'm having 32 points, 9 assists season on average. 
This game I had A+ rating 61 points and 12 assists. 61-12... I even had 8 rebounds which I simply never do

And we lost 126-159...
Danny Green hit 4 threes in a row only in first quarter
Dwight Howard had 19 point game and he hit ALL his free throws
Antetokounmpo had 20 points... while he averaged 34 in season

And most importantly I'm a 3 point sharpshooter with 99 points in 3-pt stat (I've got 48% 3PT% on average), I have won 3 point contest and this game I hit 9-25 threes and realized that game just won't give them to me, as my team is scripted to lose...

126-159!"

4965,"Wheres my 10000 FREE vc, I buy 35000 vc wheres my bonus"
4966,"This games single-player, mainly franchise (MyGM/MyLeague) is so entirely broken its laughable. It's obvious 2K has switched their focus to the neighborhood and the gamemodes that are riddled with microtranscations. 

Even with sliders the MyGM mode is as barren as the Sahara desert. No narratives, practice is useless, mentoring is useless. And no matter what every player wants to leave even if you are first seeded and win the championship. And even if a person wants to come back in FA guess what? Its impossible to sign them for a long term contract because of the bug with qualifying offers. Complete bullshit.

And don't get me started on the gameplay (with the help of online ""realistic"" sliders). Players sliding on defense to make way for the offense is very apparent. Rebounds are totally scripted from the time the ball leaves a players hand. Mid game adjustments make absolutely no sense. Offense is overpowered by the badge system.

Realtime physics is very needed in this game. 

Got this game for dirt cheap and I still feel cheated. Fuck."
4967,"IF THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE THIS FUCKING EXPENSIVE, AT LEAST MAKE IT FUCKING GOOD. I AM WIDE OPEN AND I DO A SLIGHTLY EARLY RELEASE WITH GOAT MICHAEL JORDAN AND THEN THE SAME CARD MAKES A 100% SMOTHERED FROM THE LOGO SHOT. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME, OR 2K21"

But only if you are lucky enough to even load your career as most of the time when you try to load you get error 04d8c39c.

So sudden no error no nothing. Cheaters, mod.ers toxicity at its best as well. It's hard to find normal people indeed but when you do it's ridiculous not being able to play and very frustrating. I believe there is an audio driver issue in the game. I'm using a wireless headset and every time I see voice chat icon without any voice on chat I know something's messed up, (tried everything plausible) but apparently other people have the same issues and  PC is the unwanted child of all of those platforms for 2K.

5004,"First time playing a 2K game since the 17 release and honestly, it's pretty bad

It's sad to see that the graphics are the only improvements I see that they have made over the past years. Buying an annual sports game release and only seeing better lighting and a roster update is a slap in the face for the fans. 

Gameplay is horrendous. At moments shooting is smooth but then at other times shooting almost a perfect shot would miss no matter how close you are, whether or not you are being covered by an opponent. Passing the ball as well can be confusing at times as well. I'll try to pass to my teammates and it'll either pass to someone that i don't want to have the ball, or they just straight up don't pass. Defense although just as terrible, I don't have much of a problem with because it's at the very least somewhat consistent. 

Besides exhibition games and occasional multiplayer against friends, the only other mode I tried getting into was MyCareer. 

MyCareer in my eyes is a failed attempt at trying to be something they aren't. I get that they want to make it seem more personal, and although I haven't seen or played past MyCareer modes, they have to trash the story aspect. It's so awkward to make a player that looks like you, give them a name, then be thrown into some god awful story plot that came from High School Musical with the dude that physically looks like the player you made, but now they gave him a voice that makes me sound like I'm 20 skin tones darker (I'm a vary pale man), the announcers don't even say the name I gave my player and default to the story name, and now the personality your ""new"" player has doesn't even match what you were going for. And if they want to stay on this route, can the voice actor playing us not be awful? In fact, a lot of the voice actors are pretty bad. It would be so much tolerable to play if they had a good story and better actors and writers.

I have done my best to avoid multiplayer (MyTeam) due to all of the push back it got from fans and critics. If you want to see what multiplayer is like then just search it up.

2K use to be a well respected company and people are willing to give them a chance to regain that respect but their greed is what moves the company now. The fact that they still are selling 2K17 for $60 tells you enough about what they care for more. I only bought this game for $8 on sale and I'm still unsure of whether I made the right choice to buy this. In conclusion, look for alternatives before you consider buying another 2K game."

 Extreme Microtransactions. [/b]

[i]2K[/i] has always been my go-to NBA Sim. I’ve always and only bought [i]2K[/i] for casual exhibition games and [i]MyGM[/i] playthroughs and never really dug into [i]MyCareer[/i]. I decided to go and really do it this year. I didn’t really hate the grind that much because I personally enjoy doing so and I thought it was fast enough to at least get to 85~90 without spending a single dime plus getting your badges up and running early is fairly manageable to me. But for most people who can’t spend 100+ hours in games, I can definitely see why it still feels like a legit grind. What I find ridiculous is that it has the greediest microtransaction system in any online game I’ve messed around with and it has been a horrible cycle of deliberate money-grabbing each year! I haven’t even touched [i]MyTeam[/i]. The fact that they always price 2K games at a full AAA tag like they are actual new games, which clearly are not, and still has this much ‘Casino’ inside is just straight up BS. Everything that makes any game enjoyable deserves praise, but this has been a blatant cash grab for multiple years now. I won’t talk about the good stuff and I’m giving it a negative feedback just to be on the player-base’s side who are clearly being milked for a long time already, with zero regard towards its loyalty. 

Easily one of the hungriest publishers of the last few years. This could be my last 2K game if they continue to push this predatory business model."

5016,"Fucking autistic game with full of cheaters i will find everyone and kill every one of 2k developers

update : still sucks"
5017,"Thank you 2K for turning a game that basketball fans have counted on for entertainment and pleasure into a pile of s***. I dont understand how you people can sleep at night knowing that you are preying on fans young and old with your microtransactions. You already charge 65 dollars for an unfinished, copy and paste game, yet you still force us to pay at least 100 dollar more just to make our character playable. Add another 100 if we want to wear something else besides that s****y brown shirt. For alot of people in this world, making video games is a dream come true. When I think about 2K after what you guys did to Bioshock and NBA, you should be ashamed what you have done to this industry. i know you guys will never read this comment or care, but you better pray there isnt a god, because the s*itstorm that is coming for you cant be ignored. DONT BUY NBA 2K21 DONT SUPPORT THEM ANYMORE!"
5018,The game is so buggy and has many glitches.
5019,"This game is completely UNPLAYABLE without a controller. It is still 2k and I still play, but it is beyond just relearning controls as button prompts can be different depending on event and menu. There are THREE different ways to back out of things and sometimes all will work but many times you have to click all three to figure out which works. I do enjoy it but it is incredibly difficult unless you already have a controller or are going to get one for this game."

5022,"I've had a good experience so far, online play has been fair or acceptable. Be prepared for a major grind on MyPlayer, but that should be expected since theyve merged that with the same character you play against other people with. i wish they would create a separate offline mode thats more forgiving or more favorable with XP and badges. I dont understand the hate for it, my experience has been fine, but I dont buy every NBA 2k and expect something different. Last NBA 2k i bought was 2K16, and this was majorly different and overhauled. These kinda games are like cars, they have a run thats the same with a few tweaks for about 3-4 years and then they refresh it. Decent game overall, but i bought it on sale for 14 bucks lol."

In MyPlayer you watch the last 10 seconds of the half and the game no matter what the game situation is; you can be down by 40 and have to watch them dribble it out for 10 seconds or you can be down by 6 and be fouling followed by a timeout which you have to sit through the first 5 seconds of. During the NBA workouts my player was tripping over his feet while backpedaling; do the devs not realize that everyone at that workout is an athlete? What kind of idiot programmed that into the workouts, no college basketball player-no matter what skill level-will be tripping over there feet when back pedaling. I guess MyLeague has gotten better from 19 with a few more options to change but that's about it. Once again this game is just 2k's attempt at a money grabbing game (even more than 2k19)"

5040,crashes

5049,"It crashes. The MyTeam mode will take a contract away from my players for starting a game, yet the game crashes before the game begins. When I come back to it, the contracts are gone. So, basically, I've given away 3 games per player just trying to play a game."
5050,"Essentially the same game from last year, yea there are more animations but thats like a patch amount of new content. Hopefully 2k21 is better but so far looking like the same game again"

5052,"The 2K Games keep getting worse by the year SMH.

I can't even play a Normal MyCareer game without crashing, when I attempt to sim when I get on the court it literally freezes and crashes.

If you plan to stay offline, the game is great.

Ronnie2K should be sentenced with a death penalty and so should Mike Wang. Voice chat doesn't work on PC, but does on consoles. You can't play this game without seeing at least 20 hackers or modders. On top of all that, there is no report a player option. So all these hackers don't care at all because they know they will never get banned, because in order to get banned 2k would actually have to care about their game and not be the money grabbing bitches that they are. Don't buy this game or any of the others 2k unless you are on console. This game is ass."

It's annoying and I'm deleting the game after only 6 hours of playing."

5149,"Visual Concepts are by-far the worst game developers out there. 2K exploits addiction through lootboxes and pay-to-win stat boosts. You cannot be effective in multiplayer without spending money. The NBA needs to re-evaluate their partnership and licensing with these two grifter companies. They make EA look ethical. 
Oh yeah, and the PC version of the game is not supported by the company. There is no anticheat, so most online matches will have cheaters in them. 

With the next generation of consoles coming later this year, these problems will be magnified with NBA 2K21's PC version being excluded from the overhaul. Instead, 2K will be charging their customers $60 for a roster update and no gameplay improvements. Avoid this publisher until they ""get it."""
5150,ok
5151,It's ok
5152,Flawed
5153,"Game crashes roughly ~20 mins, completely unplayable.  Besides that its good"
5154,"2K is known to be money grabbers, and that's no exception with NBA 2K20. MyCareer and MyTeam are littered with microtransactions that make the game pay to win, so it's no wonder people hack to make their guys have slenderman arms and 1 inch tall. Advertisements are plastered all over the game, whether it's in MyCareer or even in the loading screens. MyTeam by around January and Feburary becomes stale when they start pumping out Galaxy Opal players like it's candy. 

HOWEVER, there's something to be said about the presentation and the best game mode in the NBA 2K series, MyLeague. When 2K tries, it can produce amazing results. There are locker room cutscenes, interviews with players and coaches and our favorite broadcasters Shaq, Kenny and Ernie. MyCareer has hours of brilliantly animated cutscenes and voice acting, which is definitely an improvement from the atrocious voice lines from NBA 2K15 that sounded like they were reading a book out loud in English class. The cyberfaces, while not the best on some players like 2010's Kobe and rookie LeBron, are very accurate and detailed. There's tons of replayability in MyLeague. Take someone from the 90's and see how they would play in the modern NBA, remove everyone who makes the All-NBA each season and see how terrible the league gets, put in your 99 overall created player and watch him break all of the records, whatever. There's so many possibilities in MyLeague and tons of outcomes for you to observe. Plus the simulation speed is way faster than on console. Player and team's stats are in-depth and advanced, which is a refresher from most sports games like modern Madden games who have basic stats. You have to think about what kind of impact each move makes, from releasing a player to signing a team owner.

NBA 2K20 isn't really a game for your casual NBA fan and more suited to hardcore NBA fans (or kids who wanna flex on the park with the VC they bought from their mom's credit card)"
5155,it is fun to play
5156,Cross platform play please!!!!
5157,good
5158,MyPark is a joke. Stupid input lag online. Most people are cheating. Trash.
5159,"This game is good, not as great as the previous games such as 2K15, 2K16, 2K17. I don't suggest buying them now as the servers for those games shut down. The park has a lot of hackers, you could hack yourself too, everyone is basically a hacker. I'm ok with the hacker because the hacks only include attribute hacks, clothing hacks, takeover hacks. But the hackers you need to look out for are the wingspan hackers, they are no fun and are annoying to play with. Yes, you can compete with them, if your good enough. Single Player is the same thing since 2K18 except no offline mycareer."

5163,"This doesn't play like a port, which is a great thing.  An Xbox or similar quality controller is a must, as you expect.  My 5 yr old computer is able to play the game capably.  The ""put your face on your player"" feature on the associated app is wonky as all-get-out, but I am chalking that up to the fact that I have a beard that makes detection a problem.  

What story line there is in the beginning through college and g-league is fun, and better than not having it at all.  

There are plenty of guides that show a novice like me how to build a dynasty player.

I buy sports games sparingly nowadays, so I can't speak to the upgrade of 2k20 vs its predecessor."

5170,This game sucks major ass!  DO NOT BUY!
5171,Scripted as all get out. Not worth the grind there are to many hackers in park. I scored 50 points in one game and the very next game air balled 90% of my shots even though I have 90s on all my shooting stats. I averaged 30 points per game and couldn't buy a bucket to save my life and struggled to scored 20 after I got my average to 30. This game is very heavy on the pay to win and it doesn't care if you are a 99 overall you will still play like a trash can who doesn't belong in the NBA. I would rather play FIFA than this dumpster of a game.
5172,dogshit game filled with chinese cunts cheaters
5173,its 2k what do you expect?
5174,This game is an absolute pile of shit. It is full of modders and people that are too fucking pathetic to play the game regularly because they suck.  There is a long list of things that is wrong with this game in general.  Take fucking VIP out of the game.  We win a game and my buddy gets kicked off of the court by a modded legend and ball hogs the ENTIRE game.  There is people walking around with 7' arms in park and are physically unguardable.  If you would just show the PC version the same attention as console the game could be playable.  2k has been and always will be all about the money and not about the fucking people that are about playing the game for fun and its ridiculous.  I will never buy another 2k game until they get their shit together. fuck this piece of shit game and all the faggot modders that get a hard on from being good at the game because of cheat engine.
5175,"FIRST OFF I WANNA KNOW, WHAT THE F""CK IS THIS GAME ABOUT!  ABSOLUTE TRASH MULTIPLAYER, EVERY LOBBY IS FULL OF DEGENERATES WITH 12FT LONG CANOES FOR ARMS... YEAH SOUNDS EXCITING RIGHT? GET THIS TRASH GAME OFF MY PC NOW! NEVER AGAIN WILL I SUPPORT IT

5179,"Amazing animations. An enjoyable, almost thrilling MyCareer story, which feels more progressive than the earlier approaches to MyPlayer. Some games will make you actually watch the AI and skip hitting the skip button -- if you're into it.

But it feels clunky. Animations are long and will prevent you from performing your ideas on court. At the beginning of your career, your Turnover PG will be an abomination to look at and you won't understand why your character is not jumping to block the shots, properly. That's supposed to be the sense of progression. So, you're an NBA player with no know-how to block a shot or steal a ball, but your stat increases will magically grant you that intuition. Rebounds... oh, that's a long topic, but let's say if you want a challenge and you choose Hall of Fame difficulty, and you also play anything else than a 4 or a 5, you will have games with 0 rebounds with maximum effort.

You find your character committing court violation, while you were pulling the analog ""away"" from the line. You see your teammate leading the fast break, followed by your lob, only to see the ball flying through his hands, into an innocent bystanders head (which aren't very animate anyway). You see your 7'1"" #5 not being able to box out the opposing #1 or protect the rim, while if he's a star player he'll usually grab ORBDs and dunk it.

I got drafted by Bulls in my first MyCareer attempt and thought it was the team. So, I traded. Still the same issues. The problem is, as you raise the AI difficulty, that doesn't affect your teammates. And it creates some disgusting scenes. They will still fail to find the open man, or grab boards, sometimes even nail open shots.

The progression system feels like an endless grind and you do not dare start a new career, unless you're a vivid NBA 2K player. The badge system sounds amazing but you find yourself spending copper badges on half of them, because they sound like the stuff to make a solid NBA player, but it poorly reflects the game and feels very algorithmy.

I hope to see the KB24 covered NBA 2K21 to be better than this, as I've been playing this series for many years now and would be thrilled to see it flourish and improve. After watching ""The Last Dance"", the game felt even more clunky, and it was a ""tearing up"" moment."
5180,"its good okay
"
5181,"Stick with 2K19. The way these game mechanics work goes nothing like real life, with players failing bail out passes, missing easy layups, and each player's success rate hinging entirely on team momentum.

5183,dammmm
5184,"Only worth playing for 20$ maximum and their can't be any actual basketball going on to compensate for its shittiness,"
5185,"Well, nothing new here. Typical 2K stuff... whole game revolves around making players spend money.... ""Don't like grind? no problem, give us some money and you can skip grind...."". But honestly, who the hell buy this games which are about building character in career mode and then pay with real money for a whole progress instead of earning it?
I played previously 2k17 and at the middle of a season in career mode game got bugged during all star game...so.. I stopped playing. Here very similar, after around 40+ games in career after finishing unusually good game for me I received error message saying there is a problem with connection...(Connection problem in SINGLE PLAYER GAME!!!) that's good one :) considering that my connection was working fine and no problems with any other apps I consider that error message as a fake... worse part was that game throw me out to main menu and when I came back to my career mode my worse thoughts became reality, my last game has been completely ignored and had to play it again... of course , what normal person does in situation like that? Turn off game and stops playing because what's the point to play broken game which can reverse your last game due to some random bug?  I got it on sale , but still feel a bit cheated...

5190,Game deserves the majority of shit it gets but I listened to threads and reddit for years and disregarded this game completely. The MyCareer mode is pretty fun and the grind is way more reasonable than people make it out to be. I guess if you were sweating against other players online you would care but 2k is about as competitive as cod ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
5191,yes it is crazy good
5192,"Great if you want to make a single player team or player to level up and play a career.  But if you like multiplayer, despite it having many cool modes to play MP in, is nothing but hackers and latency issues."
5193,"quite good
"
5194,"Too many error. Don't buy, just use crack"
5195,nice
5196,"i'm really enjoy this game on my carrier. but when i will play with other people i must waiting for a long time for waiting opponents.  But not really bad, i'm enjoy it"
5197,Annoying shooting system.
5198,"This game is designed to make you grind for hours, then get frustrated, then look to purchase VC (in-game currency) in order to facilitate faster stat accumulation. On top of that, the multiplayer on the PC is packed to the brim with cheaters. You'll see cheaters (""modders"") every hour of every day running around the neighborhood with arms longer than their bodies, maxed stats and badges (with a 95 Overall rating), etc. Or they'll be 7' tall Centers with the speed and 3-point shooting of the best point guards in the history of the game. So you want to be able to compete in multiplayer? You can't really, consistently, unless you're also cheating.

But what about the story mode? Well first of all, it sucks. The story is stupid. It's predictable. It's boring. It's uninspiring. And it's patronizing. Characters are introduced early on into the story (like Rosario Dawson's character), as though she's a huge part of your life, and then she disappears entirely. Your character mentions that his mom received death threats online, but then neither she nor the death threats are mentioned again. You get a ""woke awareness"" pep talk from LeBron James aboard his plane, about how it's more than the game, that it's about improving the world. Don't look now, but LeBron James is silent on the massive human rights abuses of the Chinese Communist Party, and doesn't seem to give a damn at all about Chinese Uyighurs being used as slave labor in basketball shoe factories. But I'm sure he feels great that this game *sells* digital Black Lives Matter apparel. As if LeBron James, EA Sports, or anyone else involved with this game actually gives a damn about police brutality, cycles of poverty in the black community, or (let's just say it plainly) black lives.

(Note: The main character's nickname, which cannot be changed, is ""Che."" A reference to the violent communist revolutionary, ""Che"" Guevara, who openly hated homosexuals and believed that business owners -- even if they owned a mom and pop store -- should be executed if they refused to support the cause. It almost sounds like BLM/Antifa rioting tactics, albeit in nascent form.)

But back to the game:

See, when you first create your character, his stats suck across the board. With the exception of important story mode games (like the Summer League finals game), your ability to shoot, dribble, steal, and rebound is basically garbage. And make no mistake about it -- the game will manipulate your character and your team's ability to play the game and the opposing team's AI in order to make you perform much better or much worse depending on where you are at in the story.

Once you're into the NBA and you're playing in the regular season, you'll end up finally starting to learn how to do crossover moves, how to setup efficient pick-and-rolls, and actually start being able to time jumpers from different areas on the court. But then the game decides that you've won a couple of games in a row, or your character was getting too much positive press too early (conflicting with the story line pacing), so then suddenly you'll end up losing to teams that are 7-18 or 11-12. And not just losing, mind you, but losing big. And the game is committed to the frustration.

Another example: You'll often run into situations where you're up by a couple of points at the end of the 1st quarter, then half time, then the end of the third quarter... it'll be 57-57. So your coach pulls you out of the game at the start of the 4th, even though your stamina is fine and you're ripping steals and scoring points. Then you'll get put back in the game with 1 minute, 55 seconds left in the game -- only to find out that you're now down 16 points.

There is a reason why people still talk about Michael Jordan scoring 10 points in the last minute of a game or Kobe Bryant scoring 12 in the last 90 seconds of a game to come back and send it into overtime. It's because it doesn't happen often. It's rare. Only the greats pull this sort of thing off. But the game insists that a 7-18 team has the capability of going on a 15-0 run halfway through the 4th quarter. And somehow you're supposed to pretend that your 77 Overall rating rookie Forward is going to pull off 16 points in just under two minutes, while holding your opponent to 0? It's just not happening.

That is, unless you were wise enough to spend $50 on VC in order to get an 85 Overall rating on your character to start his rookie season. And even then, some games he *must* lose.

Next point:

The game mechanics require a complex system of ""badges"" that increase or decrease certain behaviors or success rates in the game. These things are often checked on the fly, depending on player stats, sizes, locations, etc. But the game very clumsily forces weird animation glitches (or defies physics!) in order to update the simulation to meet with a new calculation result.

So for example, you'll find yourself mid layup with no one jumping to block you, only to suddenly have your character back down to the start of the layup, and a player blocking your shot. Why? The player had the right badges, so the game decided at the last second that the shot doesn't go in your favor. Blocked. It doesn't matter that you were already releasing the ball, and there quite literally isn't a way for anyone to physically block you at that point.

Or a related example: any of a number of times when your character will pause or slow down, and an opposing player will suddenly move much faster than they would normally, because the game calculated that they pulled off some great move, and your character failed the check. So you'll suddenly go from being a professional athlete, to someone moving in mud. And the animation(s) will grind to a halt as the characters catch up to their suddenly changed fates.

It's very frustrating.

Last point:

Depending on which version of the game you purchase, you can get up to 100,000 VC for upgrading your character. You get 100k with the Legend edition, which I purchased a key for on GamerGate. If you're not sure what you're doing and you setup a poorly sized and statted out character the first time, use your VC, and then decide to restart your character with a new build.... you don't get any of that VC back. It's a one time thing. No matter what. Even if you delete and recreate the same character.

Want that starting VC to make the story mode a bit less painful? Drop $50-$75 to get that 100,000 VC back. Or just buy another copy of the game when it's on sale. It's quite literally cheaper than buying VC. Legend edition goes for $25 on GamerGate regularly. Again, that's 100k VC. This feels like when you buy a printer and it comes with ink that lasts a while. But new ink cartridges cost more than buying a new printer, so you just buy a new printer every time you run out of ink. If you're going to commit yourself to playing this game because it's the only major NBA basketball title on the market, just buy a new edition of the game on GamerGate for $25 instead of buying more VC whenever you create a new character. It'll save you time and money.

TLDR? This game sucks. It's designed to frustrate you and make you purchase in-game currency with real-world money in order to keep up. The animations and game mechanics often force you into physics-breaking scenarios. And the multiplayer is overflowing with cheaters.

Rating: 5/10

Last Words: Michael Jordan is the GOAT. LeBron James is a garbage human being. Don't buy this game."

5210,"I'm someone who has never played a basketball game before and I won't spend a cent on ingame content. For now I never played against human players and only against the AI.

The game feels fun, after some hours you get the ropes of it, how to attack, how to defend and how to get better at those things. It feels less bulshitty compared to FIFA (RNG for throws seems realistic)."

5213,If you're planing on getting 2k only get it if you're a die hard basketball fan. The only appeal of the game is that it is basketball. It takes way too long grind myplayer if you don't spend money.Also the Gameplay for the other modes is not the best. Myleague needs a major update. The only mode that is somewhat fun is myteam.

5220,"TL;DR: Game is worth buying on sale (which won't happen anymore since 2k21 is out). Some problems are annoying but overall it's a good game.

If you brought 2k19 expect it to be almost the same game but with a roster change. That's mostly why this game has bad reviews but if you're a newcomer you're going to find this game fun.

There are 4 modes that you can choose from: Play Now, MyTeam, MyCareer and MyLeague/MyGM.

Play Now is an underrated game mode and often gets overlooked. It's as simple as choosing a team and playing with the AI/online. Inviting a friend to play was honestly the most fun i've had in a long time. There's also blacktop which is also a fun mode to play but people find it boring because it's against the AI.

MyTeam gets the most hate out of all the gamemodes. You start with a bunch of basic cards and grind (or pay) your way up. Many think it's a dumpster fire because they heard that you HAVE to buy vc with real money in order to progress but that's only half true. Grinding on MyTeam was actually fun and not slow at all. I got galaxy opals from just playing Triple Threat offline and redeeming tokens in the shop. Surely paying does give you an advantage but it's not necessary. 

MyCareer is one of the most played gamemode in this game. You create your own character and play in the NBA. The problem with this is if you want to have a good player you need to play hundreds of hours just to get to a good overall. You can pay your way up too but it only goes up to an 85 overall. You have to play NBA games in order to unlock more space to upgrade your attributes. This would be ok if the progression system wasn't so slow and tedious, especially if you want to play in park (which you don't because there's too many hackers). If you just want to play this mode to have a good time trying to be the best player in the NBA and nothing else then this is for you.

MyLeague is greatly the most fun gamemode but it's abandoned by 2k. You pick a team or teams and do whatever you want with them. You can change the NBA's rules, rebuild a team, simulate a players career or simply play with your favorite team and try to win a championship. Put created players in your team or draft them by putting them in a draft class, edit player's stats, make everyone a 5'4'' or 7'7'', change teams uniforms and courts or make your own expansion team. It truly is a sandbox for the basketball world but too bad it's been abandoned.

MyGM this year turned into a complicated turned based decision game. 2k19's MyGM was very welcoming for beginners and easy to learn but this year it will make you lost if you just brought the game. You customize your character and take place as the GM of a team. I haven't played this mode too much but it's worth checking out at least once.

The only reason why I wouldn't recommend this game is because it has so many issues. I can't play online because I have to contact my ISP and tell them to refresh my signal which really doesn't make much sense since I can play every other game just fine. I also ran into a problem where the game just would not load into a game. This was easily fixed by restarting the game but now not even that works. Online play is full of kids with free hacks trying to look cool and ruin everyone's experience. Buying the game on console is way better if you are looking to play online. The mods are very limited in this game. It's either changing the player's face scans or the rosters. There are some other mods that are pretty good that allow you to change crated character's body types (something that 2k themselves should've implemented) or change the court in blacktop but that's pretty much it.

Overall it is a good game but it sure has its ups and downs."
5221,"i like the game, i like my career player mode, but i dont like the micro trans, so if you want to game up your character, spend some money... pfft.."

I'm finally done with the 2K series after years of saying ""it feels like I'm playing a simulation every time...not free flowing basketball based off what you're doing"".  And i've played 2k since the very beginning days. I've seen it turn into a trash game because of everything else they focus on to get your money, besides the actual basketball gameplay. Stop supporting this money-sucking franchise."
5240,This game is dope. i bought it when it was on sale for $9 and got more than my moneys worth already
5241,good game
5242,"without a doubt one of the worst sports games, or games in general i've ever *tried* to play, navigating the menus alone is a nightmare. and year after year they take customization away so they can dump more resources into their shitty MYCAREER stories. thats the only game mode they care about and it fucking shows in this years edition."

5246,"Pretty much the only review I'll ever write up here. My game started crashing (in any mode), out of nowhere... Steam can't help it (which is understandable) and 2k simply won't do a thing about it (which is expected, given the shitty company they are). I can't get a refund (since I have the game since mid May... oh, the game worked back then)...

2k will never see a single dime of my hard earned money again."

5258," ur basically paying for a roster update again, refund the game and buy 2k11"
5259,"It was the best 2k game for pc yet compared to 14 and 17, but as I got to around game 50 of mycareer or myplayer (whatever they are calling it this year). Whenever I am subbed out I can't skip until I am back in the game and the game goes into slow motion where 1 second of game time takes 3-5 seconds of real time and eventually lets me back in the game. I can't really say much about the other modes because I don't play them but I had hoped the worst thing about the game was the terrible camera angle during several practice drills. 

Update, the game slowing down is a graphics glitch that goes away if you change to borderless windowed mode. I don't know why this issue hasn't been fixed since it appears to have existed since launch. The practice camera angles are still trash though"

5266,really trash
5267,No game chat or any chat
5268,I don't play online. The offline gameplay is the best of any 2K. With some slider tweaks it's the best basketball game out there.

5275,I honestly wish 2k took over madden 2k has made MASSIVE improvements this is the best nba so far i have played and i wish their was 2k football because this company really goes in depth in how you control your character its really neat also create a team has always been my favorite thing so again 2K PLEASE BUY OUT MADDEN

5281,Most disappointing 2K beside 2k18.
5282,Dont buy this game got the legend edition and after i bought it  and spent the vc you pay extra for my 2k account they make you maker got deleted and i lost everything. Ronnie 2k is litterally jugging us all
5283,great game always has and will be
5284,Fps is very low for this game for some reason.Although my setup is way above the recommended requirements.
5285,basketball go bounce bounce
5286,"There are some things that needs to be improved on MyCareer

- I'm the only starter playing in garbage time along with my team's 3rd string. Currently, I'm playing more than teammates and I'm the star player of my team. So it does not make sense that coach keep me in the game at garbage time.
- My stamina is drained, I'm exhausted and I can barely walk in the game but coach still does not sub me out. I'm like ""Dude I'm dying here"", but coach does not care eventhough we have 20 point lead.
- After subbing out, ""quick simulation"" is not that quick. Everyone moves with slowmotion, time speed goes slower and slower, after that simulation is completed.
- MyNeighbourhood is full of cheaters. Some players builds characters that has arms longer than their body. Their elbows are touching the ground and it is stupid as hell.
- Story was really good and I liked it so much. Making decisions, writhing to get drafted... It ended really quick and it really bothered me. I expected a story that keeps going on my NBA season too. For NBA 2K21, please write longer story.
"
5287,"Game is absolutely fucking trash

Failure to connect at the end of a completed game! All game data is lost. I guess this series is now best of 8 because this game can't save data without a flawless internet connection. I'm not even playing online. This is against bots. Ridiculous. 

Better than previous years. Still VERY BUGGY.
People like me would pay for a premium version of this game if it included cutscene and useless camera pan skipping.
Loud audio for no reason is killer. I'm looking at you PA announcer and helicopter in the neighborhood.
Game crashes during certain games in my apartment with friends and bots.

All of these annoyances aside, it is a game I play... only because there is no NBA competition."

5305,"This game is great if you love the NBA. Unfortunately this PC port is horrible. The Park is riddled with hackers. I would probably say that atleast 60% of people who play park are cheaters. But before you even get into a game, your game will have probably crashed multiple times, disconnected you for no reason, or have introduced you to the ""walk in circle"" bug, prompting a restart. All in all I would not recommend."
5306,"This game.... damn... it's the WORST nba 2k I have ever played so far. Full of glitches (clipping - once I got my ball stolen from me through my player's body -literally defender's arm went through middle of my chest... ridiculous, or crashes), it forces You to buy VC on ever step (omg You are a star now, You need to dress up - this is said during MyPlayer career mode), Your player is shit until 85+ (which requires grind or - what a suprise, buy VC!), You can't even bump physical stats this year from the start, so Your 6.3 PG will be the slowest player on court, until game 50-ish.
The best thing for me is that I paid 8$ for this crap. I am more than happy to uninstall this garbage after 100+ hrs of playtime, full of cursing, laughing and shaking head with huuuge disapproval."

{mini rant}
Its a very fun game and I buy it almost every year. The game isn't without its faults, however innovation wise NBA2k and visual concepts used to be at the forefront of sports based games but due to the current change with in the industry regarding the growing needs to further extort the players for even more money, they have been rather lacklustre in their attempts to keep doing so . To finish this rant, if you want to pick up this game at a sale, go for it but just try and avoid picking it up at full price. Also be warned, the game does and will do after the future release hound you with aggressive micro-transactions and slight limitations with gameplay that can affect the way you play."
5318,Nice ball game

5329,This is by far the worst game I have played. The online servers are unbelievably terrible and stuttery. The game is set up so you either grind 1000 miserable hours or spend 1000 dollars. Ronnie2k made a lot of late development promises that were not kept. It has the exact same park as last year and the movement of the players is way more jittery but you get used to it. I can not believe this is the final production game. The desktop logo when this game first came out was the 2k19 logo which is hilarious because this is just that game but worse.
5330,This game sucks. Got it on sale for $9 and I overpaid for it. Campaign is beyond boring. TBH I would rather play some weeb simulator over this pile of ****
5331,"I ain't really gonna say anything, I just want to give thumbs down to this ""game"" because, well, because fk this scriptfest manipulative bs so called ""NBA 2K20"" designed to milk you outta your every single penny. As somebody said, 2K might be even worse than EA. And that's something.

[b]Few months later:[/b] This game is a joke. I'm just so glad that this 'review' got such a reach and I very much hope that at least few people didn't buy this garbage because of it.

[b]26.10.2020:[/b] After playing Madden NFL 2020 for some time, I stand corrected. I've never been dissapointed so much with a game. I wasn't sure if I'm sad, angry, disgusted, or just wanted to vomit. 2K certainly did tremendous job in comparision what is EA doing with Madden. I really have to admit it."
5332,9/10 players are hackers... don't expect to ever win any games if you don't have hacks.

5341,"Fired up mycareer and realized how long it would take me to grind to make myplayer to god tier (unless I want to spend a ridiculous amount of money on VC, which I'm on not going to cause 2k can fuck themselves), so I used mods to do so for free. I don't know if I'm the minority here, but I don't want to grind a ridiculous amount of hours to pull my player out of the depths of mediocrity. 

I then play through the entire playoffs and carried the Blazers to a title while averaging 50+ points through the playoffs (my highest scoring game being an 88 point tripple double). Did I get any extra VC for this at any time? Lol naahhhhhh. Instead I got a sound bug that made it so I couldn't even half enjoy the awkward ass cut scenes after winning the finals. Oh that reminds me, I L O V E all of awkward silences in every cut scene, not to mention the post game show interviews are cringey as fuck. 

At the end of all this I just wanted to do what I've always done: go to the past champions page and see my team named as the champions for the 2019-2020 season and my name for the finals MVP next to it...but of course they...removed it???? Honestly it seems like the devs are so out of touch. Everything feels so half assed and they've actually removed a ton of single player features from previous games. Of course, it seems like they are more focused on the furthering the competitive multiplayer scene, which I can understand at this point. But at the same time they seem to have no problem with blatantly neglecting the players who only want a single player experience out of this game. 

This will be the last 2k I purchase. Time to go back to the good ol days of 2k10 when I could make my player a 7'10 freak of nature through hex edit and just have fun without being spammed by 2k2v and ads every other step I reluctantly take through the neighborhood that I'm forced to be in.

Goodbye 2k, and don't forget to shove it up your greedy asses."
5342,"Don't buy this game if you value your sanity, the PVP is set up so anyone under a 95 ovr gets screwed over, against the NPC's they put in the neighborhood as well.  Basically if you expect to have fun in the neighborhood don't bother."

5359,"It's a decent game if you're just playing MyCareer. Still very grindy and dependent on VC to improve your attributes without spending a lot of your free time. I constantly run into problems with the frame rate dropping or not holding beyond console fps, which is disappointing considering this is a ""PC game."" Also, half the time I can't even get the actual game to start without running into the ""NBA2K20.exe stopped working"" error message which is entirely ridiculous for a game that's been out for awhile. In addition to this I get a bug in MyCareer where the ""sim to next appearance"" either doesn't show up or the game just goes in slow motion without bringing up the option thus ruining my experience. This game is riddled with bugs and is unacceptable by today's standards. Play 2K19 instead, still pretty trash and grindy, but didn't have this many problems.

Game crashed while I had a 100+ gaming going after playing 3, 12 minute quarters about to end the 4th quarter. Uninstalled."

5396,"Contrary to what the other reviews say I never found the need to go for the micro transactions. People complain that the starting character for MyCareer has garbage stats that make you wanna buy VC for upgrades. Come on people, if u start out as the GOAT there'd be no sense of progression. While I agree lots of the in-game items are hella expensive, they're not impossible to grind for. If ur really into basketball, just grind and grind. There aren't any other polished NBA games out there."
5397,"mycareer saves keep on disappearing. Saves are all online so not our fault if they disappear after a server error. Support blames you and says they can only restore it once.

However this game is just under unplayable status. I run into bugs, crashes, glitches every 5 minutes. Whether its a glitch in gameplay or a game freezing bug that occurs out of nowhere while i'm sitting in the menu. Even for offline play this game has so many bugs and is not very user friendly. 2k needs to make some serious changes and improvements. 2k20 was a huge disappointment. I wouldn't recommend this game to a die hard basketball fan, I would simply tell them to wait until next year and see what 2k has cooking."

The problem is online is literally FLOODED with cheaters, everyones a 95 legend with boosted stats but you inspect their cards and they are 80's. You have players walking around with 9ft wingspans so you literally can never get a rebound or shoot. There's no way to report these players or anything so you're just left to deal with it, 2k21 needs to have anti cheat before it ends up being the same trash. Other than the cheaters this game is great"

5418,"game sucks
"
5419,"DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE
Game really wants your money for so much in-game and it shows

I was lucky enough to not have to pay full price for this. While i usually only play these yearly releases for the single player MYCareer, ever since they added the neighborhood i loved playing that as well, but this game RUINED it by allowing people to pop up with 10 foot wingspans and arms that literally go through the floor, making it a joke to play against them. Items in the store are ridiculously priced. A pair of shorts can run you as much as 15,000 VC. 15,0000!!!!!!! A skateboard or any mode of transportation to get around the neighborhood faster than the regular speed of molasses going uphill? Oh thats not too expensive, just a cool 30,000 VC or more. Daily Spin? useless as well as everybody and their momma caring about what your ranking and all your stats are before deciding if youre even worth joining for a casual 3 on 3. So if your character is rated anything from 60-89 good luck getting people to join your team or squad up unless youre playing with friends

Constant camera glitches in the barbershop and at the beginning of NBA games"
5420,"I find it pretty funny how many people wrote negative reviews saying how it was the worst game and waste of time ever.... then you look at the hours... and they keep playing it more and more... dudes be writing its ""worst game ever"" and then play 40 more hours after the review, or the complaints its not worth $15 after playing 70+ hours in less then a month.

If you do play it, check out the WNBA part, it actually is pretty cool, and check out one of their games on TV or in person its become a pretty exciting league. 

Game feels a lot like a slow progression over the last few years, I usually play these on console, but the PC ports are getting better and better (except for cheaters are more common on PC but that is every game right?). I think its the best version yet, the story not so much, its unique and interesting but eh... what do you expect right? so its ok. The game play though I think is getting better, I felt the shooting is getting better, the movements feel better then previous years(once you learn them). While trying to get better the game does make things worse; stats/badges are more important then ever, height is more important(physics of game blocking and covering %), learning plays, animations can make things impossible to counter or stop. You just have to except the limitations of the game and what they are, and that is where at times it becomes thrustrating, how many players know they can turn off the shot meter and release it based on the animation and get a increase to the shot %? Because the game is RNG and everything is % based, which means yes the perfect shot can miss, the worst can go in... playing better and having better cards just increases those %. 

The microtransactions? yeah its in your face... spending money will make it easier, but you can easily play without spending a dime again, it can all be earned slowly, but still sucks. The less offline stuff you do the less its a issue, multiplayer obviously is impacted a lot by $$$$... so it is what it is. I don't think its the worst game out there in that regard, but it is pretty bad, I think madden and some of MMO titles out there are worse. That said it doesnt bother me in this one. 

Anyway core game is a small but nice step over previous years, lot of things to do, huge game, lot of challenges, but in the end plagued with predatory microtransactions, so your mileage may vary, but you can indeed play single player without it impacting you much at all."

The second time, they said that they already helped me the first time so now they are not gonna help me anymore. So my 5 season 95 overall player just went missing.

5462,"A great game, with amazing graphics and great game modes  -- when it works. Requires internet connection for most game modes, even outside online play, which is bad but can be lived with. The real failure is that in game modes with simulation, specifically career mode, the sim often takes so long to actually begin that it ultimately slows the game down, and sometimes will crash the game. Reinstalling seems to briefly improve this, but it always goes back. I will be avoiding 2k in the future,  at least on PC"

5472,"ehhhhh..its okay 

P.S. USE A controller"
5473,"I will only talk about the offline part of the game.
 So far this is the worst 2k i have ever played, athletic players are even more like gods in the game, Giannis can DUNK over 2 centers, DRAGGING them to the rim with him. The rating for some current players are surprisingly low (some just because an injury). Also, there are many payers whose performance doesnt match his rating at all (extremely low performance with a rating a A- or A). Freethrow are crazily easy to make for almost all players.
No obvious improvement from last year's version, except for some small effect changes.  DONT BUY this game, unless you just want the new rosters for the new season."
5474,yass
5475,really fun
5476,"Meh, its the same shit as usual. Just want u to make microtransactions but it dont matter what my opinions are. yall A holes still gonna buy this damn game"
5477,Just a bad game. There are so many bugs which are not going to be fixed in the near future and this fact is quiet annoying. Another point is that the game is not really able to run with 144hz. If you try to skip a timeout or simulate to your next appearance in a MyCareer game you will surely notice that. But if you want to play with 60hz you will not have these issues. The most terrible point is that you have to play singleplayer otherwise you are not able to create your own jumpshot so the game is not playable. Also confusing is that your jumpshots are randomly changing if you restart the game. Sad.
5478,This game is trully pay to win shit...
5479,"Not good playing for MyCareer. It'll eventually wipe off your saved MC after playing a few season games. Emailed 2k support but they cant even pinpoint the root cause of this.

5483,"2K has been dead since '16. MyPARK ruined the experience for people who just want to have fun in MyCAREER. It took the focus off of becoming the best all around player you were capable of creating and investing time into and turned it into a game of numbers, numbers that had to be balanced because 2K's focus for not only MyCAREER but for every game mode is the online play. They have to 'balance' the players you'll be matching up against in the park so you can't just play by yourself and have a guy who can hit threes and take it to the rack. Even though these players exist and have existed in the NBA since time immemorial, it's now almost an impossibility due to the allotment of attributes. I will admit this is the best approach they've taken since MyPARK was introduced, but it's still limiting and frustrating as a dude who wants no part of online play. Also it crashes all the time at the very end of MyCAREER games and makes you play the entire game again. 0/10, load up 2k13 on your PS3 if you want a fun MyPLAYER experience."

This buggy mess reflects poorly on the studio, publisher, advertisers, and the NBA itself - it's embarrassing."

Matchmaking is really bad, finding a match could take ages, even if you find it, skill gap would be huge, it would not be a fair match. Also, either there is no AFK protection system or does not working, you could see AFK players full time of the match, without getting kicked/replaced by AI.

If you want to play online multiplayer, DO NOT buy this game, 2K games never had any decent online multiplayer game, they are very amateur on online side of the games. No AFK protection, very bad netcode, animation glitches, scripts, horrific matchmaking...

If you want to play as a single player, it is decent. AI is not really good, but since it is the only basketball game, i think it is acceptable."

The gameplay itself gets more and more arcade. Getting a perfect release means making the shot 100%?! What is this bullshit... I want back the feel we had with 2k11! That was a great game back then where it felt like playing basketball was rewarded."

What makes it special is that it is the best basketball simulator we have, full of replayability, game modes, and the benefit of many graphical mods and trainers on PC. Each release has its share of flaws and exploits, but from a single-player perspective (myCareer and myLeague) it is a great way to kill some time and/or build the best superstar there is, dominating the NBA in every facet. If you are a fan of basketball it is a must-have, but not yearly, especially at launch."

Your all star teammates cant hit a shot, I play on the warriors, like 30 games into a season, Curry is barely shooting  30% from 3, I have gold dimer, give him an open look and he FADES on wide open shots instead of setting his feet. Same goes for Klay. They instantly get the ball and toss up some bullshit that will never go in. There is this dumbass animation this year where ball goes in almost down to the net and then rims out. It happens like 10 times a game. I tried playing on HoF, Superstar, Allstar. The same shit.

Enemy CANT PROTECT THE PAINT AT ALL. I can have 100% FG. They dont protect the paint at all, but trying to get a 3 is insanely hard, they protect it like their life depends on it, speedboosting doing glitchy animations just to stick to you.

Also the game has CONSTANT Crash To Desktop for example when viewing roster in My League.

I only paid 7eur for this shit and I feel like I got scammed. 2k19 is a better game IN EVERY WAY. Dont waste your time on this and play 2k19 or 2k17 instead."

Also even though this game is meant for controller the PC/keyboard controls are horrid and it doesn't even respond to some inputs like I can't even play MyLeague without a controller cause the start button is not responsive even if I change the binding.

5561,Too hard for my career. Honestly they are just trying to make money off us to make the accuracy extremely low. I cannot even explain how frustrated I am. I've played my career since 2k15 and none of them were this bad. You need to play this game for like 1000 hours to actually be any good. So thanks 2K20. No more of you.
5562,good
5563,I wish NBA LIVE was available on steam 2k is the worst of all time except for the Dreamcast
5564,Ball Basket
5565,"Honestly, there is to many Micro transactions in the game for me to recommend it. I don’t want to see commercials for cars when I go to play a game. I don’t want to feel like I have to buy in game money to get a head. Some of us just want a good basketball game."
5566,shit fucking sucks dont buy this hoe ass bitch shit
5567,great
5568,我是傻逼
5569,Its fun
5570,"8 hours full of bugs but i'm not gonna blame the creators.I saw other reviews and i thought that people were over reacting so it's my bad for not researching more about it.
Sim until the next appearance is completely broken,game's randomly running on slow motion during in-game etc...I found a dozen of these issues in forums but no one had an actual solution to it.

I got the game on 80-85% sale so it's not a big deal,but it's sad because i wanted to experience it a little bit...Probably the worst purshace i've made in my life."
5571,"as long as you dont have the stupid high expectations of neckbones on steam then you will enjoy this..games good..career modes dope

I dig it"
5572,pogchamp game
5573,trash game
5574,"BROKEN GAME! - PLAY ON PS4 / XBOX - AVOID PC!

The game is filled with glitches / exploits - 2k does nothing to patch them with any kind of updates (at least they'll put in some t shirts from time to time)

The game rewards cheaters and punishes casual players

All of the above could probably be avoided if you could actually do half of the things the game says you can - since day one none of my friends have been able to squad up with each other without the game crashing almost instantly every single time - i raised the issue with 2k support and was told ''to have less friend''

The game is so much better on ps4 / xbox"
5575,"This game is awesome b-ball simulator if you play vs AI.
If you play online (myteam) you will always play vs top donators/no lifers with 99 all team, where big ass slow Shaq cab run faster than Bolt, where everyone easy 3PT even under pressure, where they reject and defend like beast. And you cant even shoot cause u have some shet like MMO debuf on shooting.etc. And yeah, 99 overall cards(players) have no personality, they look same, they do all same, etc
So if you want just to play bbal and a fan, you can play any VS AI mode this game have. It is funny and lot to do. If you want FIFA ultimate team - u ll be shicked, but fifa better. XD."
5576,Worst NBA so far. Not made for casual gamers I guess.
5577,i hate 2k
5578,
5579,"its fun, though its exactly the same as the games in the past and i would never pay the full rpice for it, getting it on sale like i did is fine, its nothing special but a good pick up for like, 15 bucks, wich i got it for."
5580,So many bugs and errors with the game that it would make it unplayable but there are no other options.
5581,"This is not a game.  Its psychological manipulation.  You should be in jail.

I will never buy another 2K game ever."

Unfortunately there is some larger annoyances, which includes - can't choose default camera view (defaults to another multiple times in each game).
"
5589,"dogshit, just like every other year except for 2k14"

5594,fun
5595,Get this since 2k21 is coming out soon
5596,Maybe this game have some minor issues but its ok and playable. For this sale its definetily worth it!

5600,I like it.
5601,Terrible.
5602,"The game is an absolute joke. They always want to push you to buy their stupid in-game currency. The game beautiful and realistic I'll give them that, but the gameplay in My Career Mode fucking sucks. For some reason my player can't even make a free throw or a simple layup despite being a professional in the NBA. When I try to defend and I press X to steal the ball, my character punches the opponent and it's a foul. I expected way better, and luckily  I spent 7 bucks on the game cause paying over that price is stupid. Don't buy if you're new to the franchise, you'll be dissapointed"
5603,for casual NBA fans i really like the game. its because also my first NBA 2K game after 2K14 so its a big upgrade in game quality and content.

5619,great and fun game. wish that my player didnt suck so much at the beginning tohugh
5620,It's very nice. I like it.
5621,Unskippable ads are still a problem. Gameplay isn't significantly different from NBA 2K19. Not actually a bad game but not worth upgrading every year. Wait until the tail end of the season and snag it on discount if you're obsessed like I was.
5622,"I bought this game because it was on sale for $8 and I still feel like I paid too much.  It's a buggy, glitchy mess that crashes fairly regularly.  There are numerous cutscenes in MyCareer where actors just fail to load, and the loading screens in general are really long and full of ads.  

The gameplay is fun and deep, but also suffers from glitches and bugs like people teleporting through each other, stats getting misrecorded, and some stutters.  

Basically if you pay full price for a 2K game then you are wasting a lot of money.  This game isn't worth more than maybe $5."
5623,.
5624,"If you told me this was a f2p game, with the amount of ads shown to you, I would believe it. I expect a certain amount of advertisements in a genre like this because shoe brands, fashion, etc are intrinsically linked with the NBA but I will never condone car commercials being shown to me during loading screens, ads that can not be moved past even after loading is complete. You will get a close up, face to camera, scene during the mycareer story asking you what your ""flavourite"" Gatorade is. You are not being asked to sign an endorsement deal it's just two dudes who have never met before casually talking about how much they love Gatorade."

Mycareer is forced online, with junker character builds that wouldn't make an NBA bench once you max their stats out - It is literally impossible to match Harrison Barnes stat spread...
Use a tool to swap for a legit face scan and you can feel less depressed about the 4 different haircuts available.
I genuinely like the gameplay, dribbling is pretty intuitive, and if you dedicate yourself to running plays you'll see decently competitive games with realistic scoring."

5651,"if you have an AMD Phenom, DO NOT GET THIS GAME. It won't launch unless you use a workaround."
5652,"If you want to spent more time on the menu watching Anthony Davis face, instead of playing... Sure go and buy the game. I hate this uni-brow dude. I already know how many strands of hair he has in between his eyes... The game will crash every time you play at random times. Server sucks, multiple times a day a full parks will crash and you'll get kick back into the menu to watch his face again for a couple of minutes. Park is full of cheaters of every kind, from subtle ones that think nobody realize they are cheating, to long ass headless giants that can't pick up the ball on check up... 

Great game... Game of the Year... 10/10"

5655,"I would buy this game again if i had to it is great.. i really have found no bugs or anything of that sort. the my games are good but the story mode aka my carrier is so good everything from the story line to chossing what team to play for to choseing which shoe brand to sign with. U can upgrade your man you can go to they gym you can go play street ball. You can do anything you want its like your really in the nba, Now the best thing is that you can play with others that have this game. I wish you could play with your xbox friends and PS4 friends but sadly this is a pc only game. You can use KAM but i use controller which is much better i would recommend useing a controller it helps  with movement. Honestly the only down part is the cost it costs way to much."
5656,"Actually, it's NBA 2K CASINO."
5657,Has some bug but great game
5658,its a very good game it is a must have
5659,bought it for like $30. still not worth it. guess i'll wait another 3-4 years and hope the company makes a decent game at some point.
5660,I loved this game everything is fun. I just wish you could choose your college but that is a minor fix.
5661,Dont trust 2k again. they care less and less every year and dont fix anything. i spend 6 months trying to fix my game on xbox with the no vc or progress glitch for them to send me 1k vc and told me to basically F off. worthless lol

5670,"Fun to play for any hoops enthusiast, as long as you're not playing online. Consistency is impossible, latency is ridiculous, shooting the ball in any way is like RNG. Career is fun, collecting stuff in MyTeam is fun. Online is pathetic."

5672,loved the graphics
5673,naikin pointnya mahal
5674,"Once the excitement wears off and the gloss fades, this game is very, very poorly made, and was designed so to scam dumb kids and unfortunately, dumb adults, to continuously feed Take-Two even more money than the literal billions in copy sales they already had. Why a business tactic that is designed to hurt the consumer works, I don't know, but what I do know is that this game, and this franchise as of late, is not good at all. Sure, it can be fun, especially when you're playing with someone else, but that's primarily because you're playing the game because you like basketball and there aren't other NBA basketball competitors out there. With that being said, that is why I continue to play - there aren't any other basketball/NBA games with a community this size, and because during a time with no basketball or other sports, it fills a void, and thus, I am addicted to even the slightest drip of NBA content. Although MyTeam is no longer fun to me, and MyCareer is exciting only half of the time, the game can keep you interested with MyLeague - the only reason I really still play. And, if you want to pay that price tag for BasketballGM with better graphics, go for it. But even MyLeague is annoying. This may be a jumbled mess of my ramblings, but overall, I would say you're better off not buying this game and supporting this company. If you do, don't buy it from an official retailer. For now, I cannot recommend this game, and hopefully, that'll change with other entries, but I don't think it will.

TL;DR: Constant crashes, horrible AI, bad animations (everything movement in the game is animation based, and of course, every animation is too long and not user friendly), bad Virtual Currency system (game is near unplayable for your MyCareer character if you don't buy VC for him), and even more. This game is just bad."
5675,I love this game.
5676,Curry!
5677,too complicated. Just add some plain ioptions. Playoffs and touyrnament and not all this crap
5678,"Game is a buggy mess. DO NOT PLAY WITH A GAMEPAD. If it disconnects, 90% of the time it softlocks your computer, the other 10% You get lucky and it just crashes the game. MyCareer character has no personality besides ""WAH IM ANGRY""

I feel like I got ripped off, and I got this game for 85% off."
5679,"Yup it's fine. If you want to play Basketball on PC this might be your best choice.
If you already own previous version, you might continue playing with it.
I didn't notice much difference between this and 2K18 version, some minor upgrades and new lineups + most active online play."

5696,"Saw Michael Jordan's ""The Last Dance"" and instantly had a basketball itch. I was really weary about buying this because all of the negative comments in here, but, as a newcomer to the series and a BIG RPG fan, I'm quite enjoying the ""MyCareer"" mode. I actually cared about what happens with the characters and felt quite connected to the team. Still getting used to the controls (only 5 hours in at the time of this posting), but playing the Career mode is actually teaching me how to play properly and went from a D- player to a B+ by the end of the draft (remember, I'm a newcomer so go easy on me).

I was also weary on buying because many people talked about it being glitchy, but I haven't found any so far and have always had a steady frame rate.

TLDR: If you're like me and this is your first NBA2K game, go for it, (wait for a sale if you want) just remember that most of the reviews are from people that have bought past titles and are comparing them (not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that it's not relevant to someone who hasn't played the other ones)"

I love basketball and i cannot wait till the day comes and someone finally makes a game that feels realistic. This game is kinda fun but super choppy, clunky and inaccurate. I cant even say how many times on a open drive to the bucket and my dude starts doing spinning shot or randomly does a stepback j into traffic. The my team seem fun ontop of the simulating leagues with different trades/drafts"
5805,"2kU could be better in the scrimmage area. 
Excellent and highly recommended game 
Especially for 2k fans"
5806,While i cant speak for the online part of the game i do have to say the offline section in this game is unbeatable. Modders have turned it into a overlooked section into extreme realistic looking games. For example Jayson Tatum got a hair cut and less than a week later modders already had his cyberface you can use. 2k hasnt. The modders in this game carried it on their back. Its also very easy to mod the game just by looking up vids on YT.
5807,"Edit: Those misses near the rim no matter what the player's rating and the opponent is getting to be way too much. 2K19 wasn't nearly as infuriating as this game. It's too bad because there are areas of improvement but the layup mechanics on this game is completely broken to be almost unplayable. I cannot recommend this game to anyone no matter the price. 

It's ok at 85% off. 

But can't stand how even the best big men miss easy lay ups and gimme's near the post whenever someone's nearby even when they are not actively defending. Doesn't matter whether I'm controlling the player or not. Never had instances like this in previous 2K. 

They are also trying to forcefeed you those Neighborhood Streetball stuff down your throat with MyRep and ""rewards"" that come with it in My Career. Those ""rewards"" used to be available just playing through My Career without Street ball nonsense. Not really interested. 

But at 85% off, it's tolerable."

5822,"The lack of competition with other basketball games made 2K too comfortable and rest on their past successes.

- MyCareer mode is still ok, but the story is not interesting nor decent, like every single edition.
- Parks and other Online game modes have lag, delay, server connection problems, overall the online experience is bad, the community is toxic, so those game modes have no purpose if you don't have a squad.
- Ultimate Team is solid, challenges are good, not too deversified but I guess 2K couldn't think out of the box for this one.

The main problems with this game in my opinion are the AI and the animations. Team mates don't execute plays, centers with no 3pt shot stay in corners, others are missing a lot of WIDE open shots. Screens don't trigger / animate like they should, opponents go through the screen as soon as it is set. And i'm not even bringing up the times the ball goes through hands, arms, heads, with no change in trajectory, the times you dive for a loose ball, grab the ball and then slide out of bounds, the reach-ins that either immediatly fouls the opponent or just does nothing to bother him. The times you have a clear path to the hoop on a fast break or penetration and your player just trigers a pullup in the paint instead of a lay up or dunk.

A lot of small glitches and bugs that could improve the game drasticly in my opinion. It's in the quality of the details that you can really see how good something is. NBA 2K20 is not one of those things, especially if you consider it's basicly the same game every years sinds new gen consoles.

Good overall game but way too overpriced for what it actually is. 2K has been recycling their game for over 3-4 years now, so there is no way this should be 60-70 bucks each year.


Ps: BTW, fuck 2K for always giving no shits about the PC community and always giving us a worse version of the game compared to consoles. Fuck them and Ronny for false advertising the park and other features of their game. I paid 13 bucks for this game and won't ever pay more than 15 bucks for a game that is filled with micro-transactions, pay-to-win mentality, bad servers, no fucks given about the feedback of 2k players / community."

5834,"Inconsistent offline game play. Many shocking moments could happen in one single game where something that would never happen in reality happened to my team. Players missing easy under the basket shots, making awkward shots and missed when they are only 3 feet away from the open basket. Towards the end of the game I'm down 2 points and somehow I got a chance to create an open lane for T.Harris to drive to the open basket without anyone near him, and then I pushed R stick towards the basket, and the weird thing happened. Harris made a fake shot and then turned around doing nothing, and then the defenders caught him up and he missed the shot. Stuff like this will never happen in reality. It's just so stupid."
5835,fun
5836,good
5837,"Do not buy this game, Im try to be objective here. Ilove NBA 2k but this game is full of grinding, you have a lot of time to grind in your career mode, everything should buy with VC(in game money currecy). It is not recommended to the player that wont use alot of kuota because when the game loading it will automaticly start 2ktv and its consume alot of bandwidth. You will start as 60 overall player with unlogically team that very bad at anything. They won't pass to you, and yeah this year 2k remove rookie difficulty, GL with that.
What's good from this game?
The story
The graphic

Conclusion: This game is only recommended for who doesnt have any NBA 2k games as long as discount sale and who has a lot of money and confused how to spend their money. If you already have 2K games do not buy this game, very not recommended


after additional 307h played: This game will death instanly, im sure, they always promote their 2k21 on their 2ktv, also they never update myteam anymore after 2k21 release. Yeah also they will do the same thing to 2k21, if you buy it, it always same grind thing also will stand only for last 1 year."
5838,"cool game, a lot of grinding and some bugs but overall OK"
5839,"I've never made a review before, however this game has made me feel the need to post one. its clear the developers of this game no longer feel it important to improve their game or try their best to make it a truly immersive basketball game, their goal is simple, force players to buy VC(in game currency) to improve their player to make them even just a semi competitive player, i expect nothing less from a company that sells their older NBA games at full price even as the newer ones have been out for a period of time. trash game, trash devs, trash company. do not waste your money."
5840,"The few improvements to issues I had with the previous year's game don't come close to the number problems I have with 2k20. Career is fine if you want to sit back and have zero challenge but for those who like to play with other people, don't even bother. 2K has consistently refused to do anything about the prolific cheater situation in park games and as a result the multiplayer is a complete joke. You will be hard pressed to find a single park game that doesn't contain someone who has hacked their character in one way or another and it absolutely kills the game. It's become clear that the PC is an afterthought and nothing more than way to squeeze out what little more money they can from microtransactions. It's sad to know such a solid basis for a very good game is so drenched in the apathy from 2K. They've stopped caring and it shows, a lot."

5848,Absolute dogshit. Worst 2K in the last 5 years. Teammate intelligence has never been worse regardless of difficulty. Animations are sloppy and lazy. They put no effort into the actual game and it shows. Don't waste your money.
5849,trash ass game
5850,so many problems
5851,"Similar to NBA 2K19.  A new story and some new cut scenes in MyCareer mode.  In the end though I went back to 2k19 simply because I do not do multiplayer, i do not do the neighborhood, simply just the MyCareer mode.  And after slogging through the process of getting my player in 2k19 to be one of the best I simply did not want to go through the long slog again on a bad team with a bad player and play 200+ games just to get them to where I am now.  Now if we could import from existing games to the new game...that would be cool."

5853,"it takes forever to find a match on myteam,
also how can player of the game be determined before the match ends is beyond me.

5862,"WARNING: A GAME DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU BUY VC!!!

I bought this game to play some My Career. Ohh boy this game is trash. My player can do nothing. He can't run, he can't jump, he can't shoot, he can't even dribble, can't hit free throws, etc etc.... Playing My Career is the worst grind ever. But don't worry. Just pay 100 extra bucks and boost your guy.

And then all the presentation. I keep mashing my A button for 2 minutes straight before a game starts. All that presentation nobody cares about anymore. This BB game makes it very hard to get some good BB minutes in. Every few seconds there is some f...ing presentation you try to click away.

The freeking game didn't even show me my draft?!? There was some sort of video that I got drafted but they didn't even show me my Pick #

Thank god I only payed 7 bucks for this trash game. NBA 2K needs some competition or else they keep releasing trash like that. A game I once loved got reduced to trash over the years."
5863,Время 3 утра баскетбол ногой
5864,I like a lot this game. I truly recommend
5865,"As someone who likes basketball, playing NBA 2K20 was an obvious choice. As I am writing this review in 2022, I am also looking back on the NBA 2K games that have followed 2K20. In short, most of the games in the series are very similar. Whilst this is slightly disappointing, I think that 2K20 really stands out from the later games as a better experience. The mechanics of shooting and guarding, for example, are much better than they are in the recent games. Whilst the map is the exact same as NBA 2K19, you won’t notice that similarity if you only play this game. The campaign is fairly standard, following a college student who wants to make it into the NBA. This is fairly realistic and the graphic design helps to provoke that feeling. To conclude, the game is much better than the NBA 2K games that follow, and I would recommend this game to any basketball fans."
5866,"oj9uj9kl,"
5867,its legit man people get this
5868,"This game sucks
"
5869,"actually an objectively bad game, DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY!"
5870,The game crashes a lot in my park and you will LITERALLY have to restart your pc when it happens. Excluding the crashing the game is pretty fun to play with your friends in but unless you want to grind all of your already miserable life away then you're gonna have to drop some bands on VC so you can actually enjoy the game.
5871,"I haven't played since 2k12 and very little of 2k19 -- I do like the MyTeam concept it's just it took me a while to get used to the Latency. That's the only gripe I have with this game, is the Latency of online play. 

I don't really enjoy The Neighborhood and MyPlayer at the moment, but it's not that bad. It's more of mediocre and I don't really care for it as much as MyTeam. 

Overall it's a solid 3/5 for me, I would still recommend that you pick this game up if it's on a huge sale like last summer.

I'm looking forward to NBA 2k21 -- hopefully latency issues are fixed for online play and the 3/5 will definitely go up to 5/5"
5872,"fun

5873,"I like this game,,but matchmaking is pretty instiable
"
5874,"No OFFLINE MyCareer mode ... in 2k19 offline career mode only had basic features, not even sponsorships/contracts. Now it's totally gone, I'd request for a refund if I didn't get this game from a bundle."
5875,GAME IS SHIT
5876,bad
5877,"really fun game, but i cannot at all find a online game"
5878,its good stop the hate
5879,"National Bullshit Association 2k20

So many content, modes, videos, interviews, actors, half time shows, commentators, my career scenes that are long and boring, progress bars here and there, micro transactions, etc... man I just want to play basketball. 

Save all the money on the above and improve the gameplay and AI, game needs to feel more realistic on the basketball plays side, execution of shots and movements are realistic, but as a whole it doesn't give you a different experience than any other previous game of the series. We are in 2020, I think we can do better beyond the excellent graphics, get that AI smarter and capture better the essence of basketball.

2K needs to stop developing a game every year and start actually taking a look at the core of the gameplay in the long term. Otherwise is a reskinned game every year with extra content that keeps growing and just adds stuff that doesn't bring any value to the actual basketball gameplay."

Okay everyone says it's garbage. Good news is I didn't notice. Seems like regular old 2K to me with better animations and graphics and newest rosters. 

I just wish I could voice chat. haven't figured out how to do that yet. But like, do I want to talk to the types of people who play 2K games...? Yes... yes I do"
5885,"It's a fun game with decent graphics and responsive gameplay. The MyCareer story is fun, but nothing special as usual. 
Online play is borderline unplayable. The game is so unbelievably laggy playing with friends, in the neighbourhood, etc. It's not bad internet, as lag doesn't exist in any other games. ALL of my friends experience similar issues.
If you want to play online, don't even bother. If you just want to play some 2K offline, go ahead."

5890,"IS ADICTING, I PLAYED FOR 5 HOURS IN ONE SITTING AND IT BARELY FELT LIKE ONE HOUR"
5891,good
5892,"The game is fun but has a big learning curve for new players. Some features are aggressively annoying.
Like every other 2K game you might get a sound problem. You either have no sound at all our your sound settings change by itself w/o a certain pattern. 2kTV sound can't be adapted. I wish they would just hire a sound engineer to fix these problems.
Something similar to the sound problem is the stick setting which decides on its own to change. This is also an issue with the 3-4-5 many different options. Normally you would put a general options setting in the interface but this game has different option settings in each different layout. It is confusing and hard to make the perfect changes in these options."
5893,"Me and 5 other friends bought this game during Summer Sale. Trying to get into multiplayer is an absolute disaster. Each one of us would crash at different times almost every 10 minutes whenever we would squad up. Absolutely worst experience we've ever had with an online game.

Game is unplayable with friends."
5894,"No. Extremely poor quality multiplayer. Neighbourhood crashes, bad match making, just the overall extent of bugs in online greatly degrades the game. Oh, and hackers. Plenty of those. The career is decent, the only redeeming feature this game has. Too bad you cant experience its integrated multiplayer experience."
5895,"If you are looking to play with friends this game becomes a goddamn nightmare. You would think that AAA 2k asshats would be able to make online even semi-playable, but its full of hackers, disconnection bugs, and shit matchmaking."

5910,good
5911,They made the game too difficult to combat the blow by game play of 2K18 and it suffers. The fluidity of the offensive game you had in previous titles are gone. Overall I give the game a 6 out of 10. Still fun to be had but its just not enjoyable enough gameplay wise for me to recommend . I mostly play myleague and thanks 2k for keeping the franchise / GM elements alive in 2k.
5912,never EVER play a 2K game on PC. seriously. don't know why they even bother porting these anymore.

First, FYI, if you are a same MC interested as me, you have to be prepared yourself to stay in a long ""off-line trip"", it is because the server of neighbor is bullshit, high ping on your crossover and shot,besides that one of  your teammates or your opponents must be long-arm edited by cheating program, so you basically are able to develop your role for career in NBA, which you will feel bored eventually to against AI, and one more is that even though you are overall rate 99 with defensive pie chart you chose, the AI still can sneak beside you and run faster than you. :) WHAT ALL VC AND TIME FOR ?"

5931,"The heavily monetization of the nba2k20 takes away from the full potential of the game. There are aspects of the game that are great. Sometimes the camera does some strange movement in the my player mode not fluid during the sim on the benches. The way shots are calculated based of your difficulty settings makes the game feel automated and robotic. 

I feel like I am playing a cell phone game with the over monetization.

For example i was having a ton of fun on the 3 vs 3 make your team mode but the game did not explain that your cards or guys only have certain amounts of use or you have to spend in game curency to ""extend"" their contract.. Well the way cards work in any other card game is that once you own that card you can use it however you want with unlimited use potential.. ie deck building mtg so on.  Overall could be a really fun game mode to play but its gimped to make people want to spend money to play better which is wrong when the person payed for the full game."

not to mention you have to upgrade your character using the same currency you use to buy clothing, shoes and tattoos with. I love the customization but i can't fucking get to it because all my money in game has to go to my character, who doesnt even get better with any upgrades"
5940,this shit is ass LMFAOOOOO

5942,"The modes are good, especially the park mode. It's quite interesting. You can choose which chart, how to improve your character, and use it to fight with the real players. It's quite fum. However, the server is a little bit bad, it always lag. However, it's all fine if you play single player. ;)"
5943,j
5944,"It doesn't have any major improvement from the last game. But if this is the first NBA 2K for you then it's a good game. The game play and graphic is very realistic. And the presentation is good. 

But the My Career mode VC is still the problem. People have to grinding and play on My Court/ many mode to get extra VC. Unless you play for 12 minutes the match VC doesn't worth it. Also they need balancing for cosmetic item price. 

I don't play My Team and will never play it. Cause the card game who are pointless in my opinion.

Overall its a good game if you like to play offline and like basketball. But, they still force people use micro transaction if they don't want to do a long grinding, which is sickening trend for me."

5956,"Bought this because it was on sale, despite the mixed reviews and warnings on the game. 

Don't buy this game. 

This game is beyond grindy and controls feel like there's a significant input lag when pressing buttons on my controller connected via usb. online requires me to unplug my mouse, keyboard, and keypad because there's no option in the game to switch inputs on the fly leading to a loss because I cannot move my MC on the court in neighborhood. Regarding the grind, it is insane how tedious it is to earn VC. It would've been fine if VC was used for cosmetics and the gambling aspects of the game, however it is also tied into character progression leaving you with a tough decision whether you want your character to ""git gud"" or not look broke as hell with the default clothes or even paying for the gambling to get better cards for myteam. The game constantly nudges you to pay for more VC which they constantly add the button to purchase VC when you're using VC to buy stuff. 

One of the most egregious moves 2K has implemented is to move MyCareer to online only, and it wasn't an accident. 2k knew the best way to entice players to pay for microtransactions is to make it online and have other players show off the cool and expensive items they've bought for their characters. You're not just worrying about how your character performs now, you're worried how your character looks to other players. For evidence, look no further than the 2k Neighborhood, where all the shops, gym, and training center are. In order to utilize those amenities, you must navigate yourself through the neighborhood, and walk by other players who look better than you in order to reach which ever facility you intend to visit. Sure you can try to avoid the neighborhood, however it is near impossible since you need to visit the shoe store for some shoe deals in mycareer, as well as the training facility where you can boost your stats by playing a couple of bad mini games.

So, let's talk about in game advertisements. Product placements are everywhere in this game, and when I say ""everywhere"" I really mean EVERYWHERE to the point where in a cutscene in mycareer you meet a representative for beats to which he asks the player to plug in beats in an interview. 2K was not subtle on the beats plug in, this game just advertised to me about certain beats headphones with active noise cancelling, to which I argue that my Sony WH-1000XM2s are just good enough for me with their amazing active noise cancelling which helps get me through this game, plus the Sony WH-1000XM2s has an ambient noise option which allows sounds from outside the headphones to pass through so you can hear and pay attention to your surroundings.(now wasn't that a good product placement? lol) This game is just a gargantuan advertisement that YOU PAY FOR. 

You are paying to get served advertisements, period."

This game it looks so much like FIFA, cause it could be so good and stinks so bad!

The thing I most like about Sport Games it's the carrer mode and the customization. The NBA2K Carrer Mode it's actually pretty good in comparison with FIFA. However, its not even a little noob friendly! I don't really know that much of basketball, but I really like to follow the nba and for me, this carrer mode it so much difficult, I can't make more than 10 points per game and makes me very frustrated. The fact that this mode is also pay to win (abou the VCs) just like the FIFA Ultimate Team, makes my experience much more disappointed.

The graphics and the immerson are such nice features that get lost in such a bad game :/

edit:
All right, as you may seen, when i had only 20 hours played i said that this games stinks, but now that i have more than 500 hours, i would say i recommend this game lol

my first impression of this game was very bad, and the main reason for this is the fact that the grind level on this game is hard man, but when you start getting better skills, you start having a really good time. :)

another thing to know is that, even though this game is not not noob friendly, after having a better notion on the nba rules and the nba2k commands, this game becomes so much better. Also, now that my player have 99 overall, i get a lot of VCs in each game, allowing me to create new player/carrers without having to grind as i did in my first playthrough."

5991,"If this is your first 2k game, it's pretty fun. There's a lot of comments because people are mad with the franchise to date. As a standalone game, it's not bad if you have time. If you don't have much time, you won't enjoy it a lot because there's lots of things to learn before it's fun."

6023,The usual EA trash. Stats can be maxed via credit card. No worry though BC stats mean nothing in this game BC everything relies on badges aka Perks. If your 10% contested and shooting anything that isn't a perfect green release youll probably miss if you don't have perks like quickdraw/deadeye/range extender. They changed up how jump shots work as well making them take longer to further boost the effeciency of perks and further make attributes meaningless.

6028,Best NBA so far very realistic gameplay
6029,"Terribly grindy venture. In order to level a Mycareer player YOU HAVE TO SPEND $50 or 100 in game hours.

I have currently spent ~10 hour playing my career. My character has gone from 65 to 67."
6030,suck
6031,unplayable
6032,"This is a $60 game with Ads. Your character can't shoot hops for shit, but somehow got drafted into the NBA. You will spend half of MyCareer on a bench. The Graphics are dogshit, and the multiplayer is full of cheaters. The only good thing about this game is the music selection."
6033,"Nothing like the real thing.

This is game is a mess. I know everybody dislikes myteam. What I don't know it's why everybody is fine with the gameplay. It's arguably the worse part. It fouls you when it souldn't, ball collision is buggy, it passes to the wrong player, defense is non-existant...  and on and on.  PAINFUL to play.
Tutorials are bad. BAD! Controls, play rehearsals. Are very poorly explained , implemented with a painful UI. 

The only positive I can think it's that it has roosters of multiple eras, free of charge, though sometimes players don't look nothing like they did.

In conclusion, don't believe what you hear that these games are good at representing basketball, They don't. They are atrocious gameplaywise and are not representative of the way the game is played today."
6034,tis fye bruh how do you not like this
6035,insufferable
6036,nice
6037,"One of the dumbest, and most infuriating games I've ever played.  Not only will your team mates NOT pass you the ball when you call for it, the game will actually penalize you for asking for the ball....in a game where the grind to improve your character is Korean MMO levels of stupid.

Klunky, sloppy, pigs on ice handling, and riddled with horrible design choices.

You come out of college as a first round draft pick.....who's stats are all 40 points lower than anyone you'll be playing!!!!!  Thanks for putting me up against that shooting guard, with 91 speed, and then taking points AWAY from me because I couldn't cover him.  It's just beyond stupid game design, to the point of infuriating.

To add insult to injury, in no particular order:

Career mode:  Doing pretty well?  Time to end that.  There is a script in place for career mode, and you WILL follow it.  Doing too well?  Time to make you suck for a few games.  Yah, the Lakers shot 36%, and James missed 4 free throws in a row down the stretch.  Your usual 35 points a game ya...well...you got 9 this time, sorry.

Being benched when winning:  Same as above...doing too well?   You clawed your way back to a 4 point lead?....time to sit on the bench, when you come back, there will be 4 seconds left, and you're down by 20.

Predatory gaming at it's worst:  The INSANE badge and exp grind is such an obvious pay to play grab, in a full priced game, it's beyond shameful.  This pay to win is worse than most F2P games I've played.

I put some time into this game, because I missed my refund window, covid, and because there are parts of the game that are great.  The character creation and development COULD be amazing, if it wasn't tied to such a horrible and infuriating mess of a money grab, coupled with heavy handed AI and scripted outcomes.

This game would be so much fun if it encouraged rerolling and playing different characters, and if the players actions actually mattered in the outcome of anything.  As it stands, it's one of the most frustrating games I've ever played.  The idea of playing multiple builds with the level of grind it takes for a character is just.....beyond bad game design.  They have missed every single good point about this game, and actively destroyed them along the way to money grab heaven.

This is one of those games that is especially rage worthy, because it had the bones to be amazing and not only squandered them, but took a giant dump on them."

6044,good game but they need to update this shit wtf!!!!!!!! we need mypark voice chat !!!!!!!!
6045,"Yes i hav 480 hours... The game at it's core is pretty solid. It has huge potential to be great. so let's start. This is my second 2k and it shows how little they care about the game. First of all this isn't nba 2k20 it's nba 2k19.2. Everything is basically  the same as 2k19. Mycarrer: The storyline is far less cringe than 2k19 and the new way to build your myplayer was a good new edit and that's pretty much the positiv. The negative on the other hand god damn.. The first seasone is just a long seasone of 2k trying to get you to buy VC. It's absolutely ridiculous how a player that's drafted into the best league on the planet and he can't shoot, dribble, shoot or even get a simple layup with just the smallest contact. The first 20-30 games is just absolute boredom of just grinding your player so he's at least decent. The nthe all star comes and it's pretty funny and the second half of the seasone is pretty fun. The playoffs is near and so is the awards. After the first seasone the mode becomes really boring. It's not even hard scoring 120 points. The AI is too bad and the pass the ball then run left and cut is absolutely game breaking. You need no iq and no skill to be good at myCareer you just need to grind for 2 weeks. The park is boring and the Rec center is pretty fun if you are 5 friends playing otherwise you'll just get a team of ball hogs. myTeam is what it is either you grind and will still be at a disadvantage after 100 of hours grinding. The mode basically begs you to pump in money into it. The cards are just too good and it takes out all the skill. They are also really unrealistic (like dribbling 3pt shooter shaq) The gameplay is nothing like basketball in myTeam. people just run around 6 feet outside the 3pt line and the shoots a deep three and ofcourse it hits because the cards are to op. I don't really play myLeague so i don't have a opinion i do play myGM tho. My experince of myGM was positiv i found it really fun but i haven't played any other myGM so i can't really compare it. Overall the game is pretty bad and the rec center (with friends), the first my carrer season (after 52 games) and playing against your friends with nba rosters is the only fun part about the game. 2k do better ffs"

This game is fantastic other than the endless amount of bugs i have personally encountered. 

If this game is on sale is worth the get before 2k21 comes around (which is very soon)

Bugs ive encountered is your player save getting deleted or your stats freezing"
6052,"This game is so broken on pc, hella hackers, every lobby is full of them so it makes it hard for low OVR players to win park games, 2k staff dont give a fuck bout the players"
6053,"This game isnt worth the $8 I paid for it. The entire thing is designed to get you to buy VC. There are actual interactions before games that tell you your clothes suck you should buy new ones, which of course cost VC. Your character in MyCareer might as well not even try to take any shots or layups until you can upgrade them. I've literally watched shots that were perfect jump out of the hoop, breaking the games physics because it was determined by a number it wasnt good. Everything about this games design is made to make you spend extra money on a $60 or more purchase and with 2k21 even worse and costing $70 at base, 2k is probably more predatory and worse than EA at this point. NBA 2k used to be a great franchise but they are now neutering their game to push predatory microtransactions"
6054,I have this game on ps4 but its not as good as that but i still like this game
6055,"Its a very interesting game.

6056,MyTEAM multiplayer and MyCAREER online is laggy af.

6059,"it's alright just..
grinding yourself hundred hour just to go online and loose to someone who just buy VC
often disconnect
AI is cheating
Crash sometimes
but you know, it's the only NBA game in the market"
6060,"nice games,  but sometime i got bugs
"
6061,Good gameplay but 2k is still pay to win especially my career. Grinding is too time consuming
6062,Great
6063,"If you bought it on sale good. BUT this game is a poster-boy/girl for in-game transactions. Almost any action or aspect of the game (mycareer) will need you to either grind for hours for just a small improvement or pay up for VC to actually play the game. As well this game may only have servers up for 2 years, so any of the effort may actually be for nothing. Also MyTeam is just about the same. Random RNG to see if you might get something useful, but in reality you just won't get jack.
MYCareer is also a heap of trash. The ""story"" is just a giant cringe. Playing is a chore. It really is just something to kill time with, with no real reward after even 10+ hours.
The AI is terrible. Even a ported Garry's Mod NPC could probably do better, EX: 90's level players brick layup after layup. A player known for inside play and grabbing boards will grab a rebound, dribble out to the three point line then hold the ball forever till lobbing it to a guard or forward to brick a 2-person covered three. It's as if 2K has never actually watched or played a game of basketball in their life. 
Also, while some people think that the shotstick is a skill-base thing, it's absolute BS. No matter how well you hold it or release it it's pretty much just RNG if you get lucky enough to get a green shot. (Also even with a ""badge"" to make the consequences of poorly timed shotstick usage minimal, you still brick shots randomly.) Seriously it's easier just to run around the AI on defense and hope you get a lucky layup to not be missed. 
Also, one final sidenote if you hate ads. you will certainly hate this game. It's one walking ad. No matter what you do all you see is ads for gatorade, shoes, or some other random thing.

TLDR: The game play is poor. Ingame currency is the pay-to-not-be-trash. Even on sale, don't waste your time."
6064,"This game is so bad at so many aspects. I will not even waste my time talking about how the AI is totally broken and the problem that every layup you go against an Intimitador Badge will 99% go off. Last NBA 2K game I'm buying until there are major chances to this horrible gameplay since 2k16.
2k21 is already going off soon and they again just shove the same mechanics down our throat expecting that we pay more and more. This game is just awful and will continue to be unless we stop buying it in the next releases.
Don't waste your money with this. If you have spare money and this game is on sale, just burn you money instead, it will worth a thousand more times."
6065,good game if just wanna play something.
6066,"way better than console
"
6067,"I saw that this game was on sale for $8.99 so I wanted to give 2K another try. Despite being relatively inexpensive, I still regret purchasing it. Most of you have already heard about the input lag complaints by other players so I'm not even gonna bother. The AI and the animations are also really terrible. There was a time when I was running the fastbreak in a 2v1 situation and the AI ran straight out of bounds as I was passing the ball, costing me a turnover. Another one was when I passed the ball to the Anthony Davis inside who was wide open, but still did a pump fake which eventually lead to his actual shot attempt getting blocked. The animations and gameplay are simply very buggy. It just screws up MyCareer and gets really annoying. The game also tends to crash sometimes for reasons unknown. I'm not big on the other gamemodes but I guess they're pretty decent. It's obvious that 2K has barely changed in the past couple games, except for some obvious minor changes. It sucks how I prefer 2K15 and 2K16 over this load of garbage."
6068,"I almost spent 3-4 hours a day playing nba2k20.
without a reason, that means I like this game"
6069,SHIT
6070,"This game is so grindy, I don't know if its possible to have a top tier character before they release the next iteration of the game without dropping extra money. 

Its sad because the game would be so much more enjoyable if the grinding part was toned down just a little bit, but haha money I guess.

6088,"I was very cautious when purchasing this game due to the negative reviews, However, being a big 2k fan when I played console, I decided to buy this when it was on sale. Gameplay is just as good as console for me personally, so I have no complaints for offline. Online I haven't gotten a lot of time in, but from what I did I haven't seen tons of hackers, a few, but not enough to ruin the time. I would recommend getting a controller to make gameplay easier, since it would be very difficult to play via keyboard."

6108,"JFC The cut-scenes.  Upon first launching the game they wouldn't let me skip them.  Then once in MyPlayer mode, there are like a hundred cut-scenes in the first moments of that play mode. I'm not joking.  Just scene after scene after scene after scene after scene after scene....I played maybe 5 minutes of actual basketball and spent another 15 skipping through scenes.  It'd take an hour to actually watch 'em.  What a joke.

There's camera wonkiness as well.  Want to play every game mode with the same general side-view camera?  Nope.  The black-top and myPlayer modes (and maybe others) force you to play from a different camera angle, never really letting you get comfortable with one view.  Then in myPlayer mode, your defender will run off the side of the screen, so you run back to try to cover him, but good luck as you're both out of view.  Then the AI will pass to your opponent and he'll score. You'll get dinged points because of a defensive breakdown, but you couldn't even see what the hell was going on.  Fantastic work, 2K.

The overall gameplay mechanics are pretty frustrating as well.  Everything is delayed, slow, restrictive.  It feels like you're moving through butter.  Everything requires a length animation, so timing things like rebounding, blocks, and steals are just plain stupid and lame.  Sometimes you get lucky, but most of the time you are just off away from the play jumping by yourself, looking and feeling like an idiot.  I read a review that this game was less about pre-recorded animations, but yeah..that guy was full of it. This game is nothing be pre-recorded animations.  It's so boring and doesn't feel at all like I'm in real control.

2K really do suck at this.  It's a shame.  They spent all this time making cut-scenes with Idris Elba, and that squirrelly dude, Thomas Middleditch from Silicon Valley.  If you just want a solid gameplay experience and don't want to pay to watch a crapload of cut-scenes, look elsewhere.  Such a disappointment.  I'd love to sit down with the development team and look them square in the eyes and just say a ton of hurttful things to them.  They deserve it for this shameless money-grab. Glad I got it on extreme discount..now I know why it was so cheap."

Boy was I glad I didn't break the bank buying this game. Even with messing with the sliders your teammates AI is flat out DUMB just watching other players blaze on by for an easy layup without the slightest bit of resistance while anyone within a 10 mile radius for the CPU will close in on you with a wide open layup and get a bogus foul with a 10% and-one rate when you've had a wide open basket.

I can't see the create a teams when i look to DL a cool team like Seattle, expansion is a great idea and the graphics are fantastic but unless I jack up the sliders the mechanics and AI in this game are absolutely terrible. Hollowing out your game for the sake of focusing micro transactions doesn't bode well for your business.

6116,"The new shot meter is total garbage.  The game world feels so much less alive than it did in 2K16, where you had your own apartment, could choose between multiple companies competing with you for endorsement offers, accept invitations from friends and teammates, etc.  This one is boring and they made it much less fun to play."
6117,Here for the steam achivment only so idc...
6118,amazing
6119,"TRASH ASS GAME, DO NOT BUY! SERVERS ARE LAGGY EVERYSINGLE DAY, HACKERS ALL OVER THE PARK, RONNIE 2K IS LEGIT THE SCUM OF SOCIETY. I RATHER PLAY NBA LIVE"
6120,"after selecting my career it is frozen , my whole system frozen 
after shut down the pc came back live 
this happens everytime ,when log in to nba"
6121,"This game is amazing, mind blowing! People fault this game because of the controls. I definitely understand that. But if you have any sort of controller lying around your house you can connect that controller to your PC easily and play the game from there. Just look up a YouTube video on how to connect your controller."
6122,qq
6123,Game is straight garbage. You create a player and can't even hit a basket... Every game my created player has a fg percentage lower than 20%. It's insane. Wide open shots can't even be made. Don't buy this garbage.
6124,Honestly this game sucks but i still buy it every time
6125,ehhh decent game ive playe them all since i can remember... this years has a handful of added features that are nice but most are same as past 2 years but if your a 2k fan if you can get it on sale I would def recommend it. now if youve purchased past 3 nba2k games and youve held out this long just wait for the new one which comes out in i believe 3 months time. I purchased mine on the steam summer sale at the end of june which was the 100$ deluxe version for somethihng like 10 or 11 bucks which I couldnt pass up. hope the review helped with your decision whether it was to wait and grab the new one on release or get this one first.. thanks again and enjoy! hit me up on park currently working on a shooting SF. till i get bored and decide to make a new build.
6126,excellent game
6127,"I have played about 9 hours on this game. I love the amount of customization on MyTEAM, the way you can upload things to the online gallery and see what everyone else has uploaded be it a logo or court etc. I played MyCAREER mode for the first time on this game, I dislike how they don't allow you to make your own true decisions, I understand they're trying to make it cinematic but then they should've gone through it all. Instead, after you get drafted to a team, after thinking you're going to get like 20+ mins of playtime on your new team, you get benched for all but 2 minutes. After you're already use to playing a majority of the game, after the cinematic play by play they planned out dies out, it's just not fun. You start out as someone who's well known, and people like you or dislike you. Unfortunately, it's just pointless to play MyCAREER mode after all the cinematic stuff it just feels like every other NBA 2k game they've ever made and no different. I think they should've just left out all the cinematic story line, and just did what they do best, BASKETBALL.

I wanna choose my own career path, I want to be either a selfish player or a team player. They didn't really give me that choice. All in all, I will be playing the MyTEAM instead of MyCAREER mode, it's more fun and it's just basketball. So if you're looking for a good ""career mode"" I would suggest the earlier works. 

YOU DONT EVEN GET TO FREAKING PICK YOUR OWN NICKNAME? LIKE? WTF?????

I RECOMMEND THIS ONLY FOR PEOPLE LOOKING FOR AN ONLINE EXPERIENCE WITH PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY VERSUS ON MY TEAM OR ON MY COURT"
6128,"must buy game
"
6129,"trash ass game, thank god i got it on sale"
6130,Dogshit compared to 2k19
6131,"You know, honestly this game is perfect for anyone who loves 2K. People complain about the defense system this year especially for Hall of Fame but in reality they just need to get good. Why play on Hall of Fame when you don't have the skill for it? But this game is easily a solid 10/10 especially on NVIDIA optimized ultra settings this game is smooth and looks gorgeous."
6132,It's fine
6133,"At first, I really enjoyed this game. I was playing it nonstop on MyTeam and wondered why there were so many complaints. I completed all challenges in Domination. However, as I started to play longer, I started to notice how clunky it was. Players that are 96+ rating play worse than a player with 80 rating. Same with the opals. They miss wide open shots over and over again. My starters are 3/5 opals and they legit miss shots right under the rim, or just a few feet away. The players on your team play no defense regardless of how you manually set up the D. Swapping between players is extremely difficult as well. Sometimes on a fast break, instead of swapping to a player that's closest to the ball, it will swap you to a player all the way across the court and the opponent gets an open lane. A lot of times when you pass the ball to your open players during a fast break, they will pause for a second before running the open floor, and the opponent will somehow catch up from across the court and contest the shot when they're nowhere near???? The opponent can be 5 ft away and when you shoot it, it will say 90% smothered?! So fucking stupid. I am aware that you can manually swap to whoever you want, but if you don't swap to the player that's right on the ball, your teammates will be in the most stupid spots. They literally run around like chickens with their heads cut off. However, the opposing computer players PERFECT defensive. Not even joking. 

They purposely make the spotlight challenges extremely difficult, it's actually ridiculous. The opponent has an avg 90 team rating, and my team has avg 97, yet the opposing team's players never get tired, and make 80% of their shots even while guarded. I'm not one to get upset during games, but damn this shit is super frustrating. You can have AD being guarded by Trae Young and still get your shot disrupted. However, when the computer is Trae Young being guarded by AD in the low post, he can score no problem??? I hate to say it because I love basketball, but DO NOT BUY this game unless it's on a super sale. I'm glad I bought it less than $10, or I'd be even more upset. Those of you who have played the game enough know what I'm talking about."
6134,"Game plays terribly on PC, for some reason the controller latency is high. The game was designed for consoles and that is what you'll get the best experience on. You can do some stuff on here that you can't on consoles, so if you plan on doing that, then maybe its a cop."
6135,dribbles are trash in this game

6141,"Unfun, grindy awful career mode and they've taken out the options (besides paying) to making it even slightly fun."
6142,"I've never bought basketball games for online play and 2k is clearly made for people who want to only/mostly play online and who are willing to grind or spend money for the online game modes. Even then if you read the reviews there are numerous problems. I only bought this when it was on sale for $5 and I play it because I love basketball too much to not be playing an NBA video game.  
MyCareer is a ridiculous grind that is constantly trying to get you to spend more money, you cannot turn off 2KTV at all anymore (minor issue but it drives me nuts), and the feel of game 40 in the regular season against a team with a 11-29 record feels the exact same as a Game 7 in the NBA Finals all in MyCareer, MyGM, and MyLeague. They tried to switch up MyGM and I personally don't know what they were going for but it's not fun. MyLeague is fun but you have to manually change everything constantly to get it to feel real. Teams never change their lineups (even in the playoffs they'll go 10 deep in their rotations) unless there are injuries and they don't adapt well in-game. In a tie game late in the 4th quarter you can run pick-n-rolls all day and the most the AI will do is double team. With how much we are able to change in regards to defensive schemes I would like to see the AI be more adaptive. 
If you are a singleplayer 2K gamer DO NOT BUY UNLESS IT IS ON SALE. I mean AT LEAST 50% OFF. They're going to try to squeeze you for money non-stop after you buy it and it's not even a game worth $30. Don't give them more than you have to just play older 2ks with mods and/or downloaded rosters."
6143,2k might have the most garbage community I have ever seen. From the hackers to the people who won't pass the ball. I don't how 2k get's away with this dog sh3t. How does their community keep allowing them to release a 60 dollar game every year to just leave the online in disarray. I don't even think you can report the hackers or they have anti-cheat in this shi44y game. I'm so glad I bought this trash game for sale. The park is the same park from last year. Sad that this really is the only basketball game out there. Because we all know Nbalive is the same trash game. 3/10
6144,They put microtransactions in THE SINGLE PLAYER MODES WHAT????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
6145,"it's pretty fun
"
6146,Kinda addicted tbh
6147,great game
6148,This game is fucking unplayable online. the servers are absolute trash.
6149,"So you decided on a micro second for the perfect shot range?  literally timed it and it is ridiculous.  Also, slightly early and late miss more than just plain early and late shots.  Fuckin stupid.
dont put mini games into a main game if the controls are shit.  shows your lack of skill with game development."
6150,"they dont help out new players, on career its Impossible to score no matter what"
6151,This entire game is fucking shit! Legendary players in multiplayer mode is not guardable. Those motherfuckers use all legendary players. Motherfucking game company. Hope you being bankruptcy soon.
6152,Got this game because I am missing basketball. This game only made me miss it more as this is a frustratingly clunky game were the players are magnets and the ai is beyond stupid. The game is heavily bloated with weird ambiance fillers that look clunky and ugly and my career option is just so bloated with pointless features. The only way the defense can defend is by commiting fouls but for ai they are not otherwise they would foul out instantly. Cant run plays as the ai will just block you from moving.
6153,It's a good game but the MyPark is delayed and filled with hackers and demigods.

6166,"I mostly play MyCareer and I don't really have many complaints. The story was good - a team captain standing up for what the believes in is a good message. Shame the characters just seem to have vanished into thin air right after they tan out of cutscenes.
Gameplay wise it's the same as other years and that's about it.
Not a big fan of the always online thing because I can't play this on the go but it izzzz what it izzzz"
6167,trash
6168,"Dont buy this game unless it is like 3 dolars. Money grab, nothing new every year."
6169,i really dont recommend buying this if you want to play online with friends the input lag is insanely bad and 2k have been getting away for 5+ years is just pathetic.just fix the damn server 2k you're a 3A game company you have the resource and money to create a decent server.
6170,They still got a couple of things to work on but I'll definitely give it a 7/10
6171,The neighbourhood is so poorly implemented. There are some menus/areas that you cannot return from unless you literally exit the game via alt+F4.
6172,Give me award
6173,.
6174,"this game is so good, so happy i spend 10 dollars on it. i can be in front of someone on defence and they will still fucking score right in my face. but its ok i guess. you can see why its so cheap though"

6176,"TLDR: Nvidia users stay away from this game! Crashes frequently on Nvidia graphics cards (No fix).

I and several others who have purchased this game have been experiencing random crashes every 10-20 minutes of playing with no error pop-up. I have contacted 2K with no response. I have gone through multiple threads of attempting to fix the issue, ranging from updating graphics drivers to verifying game file integrity. Nothing has worked. Speaking with others on threads experiencing the same issues, it seems to affect users with Nvidia graphics cards. 2K probably will never fix this issue since they will be solely focused on making 2k21.

Comp. hardware:
Intel Core i7-8700
Nvidia RTX 2080

6182,fun
6183,It's good :)
6184,"You would probably be interested in this title only if you're a hoop fan.

I earlier had NBA 2k17. So this is definitely an upgrade.

Pros: 
Great controls, vibrant game play, decent archetype builds.

Cons:
Animation glitches, massive lag in neighbourhood or any online modes ( the most annoying part tbh)"
6185,"Good game, Well done. Too much features that doesn't need to be here. But it's a good game"
6186,Nice Game XD
6187,"nice game
nice
very nice"
6188,I like the graphics and playstyle but in the other end its all the same as NBA2K18 and 19
6189,Very good
6190,I hope you can fix the HOF level in myteam mode. It's too crazy and you can't beat it if you don't pay to win
6191,got in on sale.
6192,yes
6193,yeah
6194,MyPlayer is catered for you to purchase VC. If not the grind is painful.
6195,"NEGATIVES
Im playing in career mode. My player height is 5'7 But every Cut scene my players is 6'4? WTF 
On the Gameplay my ULTRA Settings runs are 60 fps with 4k. But Everything else in the game is 30 fps? WTF

They have some troubles programing but you didnt notice if you dont press attention. 

Sometimes the gameplay get bored when u have to make shots alone only to make them or with distance from another player. If someone is guarding you, you have 5% to make that shot! That Cut the emotion of do shots when someone is guarding you. (Im not talking shots from the pain)

YOU MUST BE ONLINE TO PLAY MY CAREER This is really bad.

POSITIVES
Better Than NBA 2k19 at least the career mode. 
Better Graffics too.  
Better Gameplay. 

At least they upgrade a lil the crowd, Now you can see them sometimes leaving the seat. For 2020 they should do more things. 

I bought it for 9 Dollars. And I'm having a lot of fun.

6197,"What happened to this franchise? It used to be so good, it's real sad to see how much they've let go of wheel and gave in to the corporate greed. I'm ashamed to like this series, EA needs to slap 2K and Take-Two in the face with a banger new game that breaks this old tired mold. Would not recommend this horrible basketball simulator. Go back and play NBA 2k16 trust me you don't lose much because they pump the same game out every year after that. You're wallet will thank you..."
6198,"Game is clunky. Just doesn't feel right when playing, causing much frustration."
6199,niceeee - flightreacts
6200,"If you own 2k19, you're better off just downloading an updated roster. The game plays worse than 2k19, the presentation is the exact same. Would not recommend even on sale for those who own 2k19 on pc or any console. This is from a pure simulation game standpoint, I know better than to play a game online with no anti cheat"
6201,Shoot basketball and goo swoosh or go brrr if rim
6202,oynayan maldır
6203,full of bugs an a fun way for EA to make a pay to win game. without you putting 40$ more than the game you cant really progress your player realistically. dont buy it.
6204,"So many technical issues that devs have no intention of ever fixing, broken game"
6205,I love the graphics and after i got use to the shooting it plays nice.
6206,"I love basketball hince why I have played such amount of hours on this game. I wouldn't recommend it however. Alot of the features were basically implemented from 2k19, liked copied. The only thing in MC I like is the new badge and overall features."
6207,kinda bad yk constant crashes but i still play because good deal lol
6208,"Horrible online play. You are more likely to get into a game with all cheaters than you are with 0 cheaters. Any game you go into there is people who hack mascots and icons that they dont have, and have wingspans of 20 feet while making their character giant. Makes the game impossible to learn as a new player. Fun game,  horrible online play. And when I say that there is ZERO anticheat, I mean it. You can literally edit your characters stats in CHEAT ENGINE. Untill this game gets anti cheat, its a no from me. Horrible game."
6209,
6210,"I saw it in discount and I decided to buy however I realized that is the same game as 2k19. Of course, AI sucks. I don't know why I believe in every NBA 2K, I'm disappointed in every year. I hope we see something else other than Zion's sweat in 2k21."
6211,s
6212,"I have a 1660ti in a laptop, and I can run pretty much anything, at least at low settings. Something is not working at all about this game  first boot it was just a flashing unresponsive mess of lagging constantly. So much so i am unable to play the game. I run 2k19 on ultra perfectly and this is making me angry. I paid money for this game, and even after a reinstall, it is completely disfunctional. Let me know if anyone had a similar problem they could help me resolve."
6213,Ball go phwoosh
6214,glass cleaning lockdown :))
6215,"I was a BIG 2k and madden fan growing up. But now that I am older, I can see it is just the same game every year. The last 2k game that I got for my self was 2k15 and had they not shut down the servers I would have just kept playing that. Even with this game being on the summer sell I do not feel it is worth the money as it is just a polished 2k15. Yeah there may be new stuff but, in the end, it is just the same game every year. It will probably be another 5 or so years before I get another one and at that point it will be because 2k made this one unplayable."
6216,Great game.
6217,its just a money grab probably like the next 2k is going to be... They never make changes that actually improve the game over last years 2k... So in in short they don't put in any effort into their games anymore... The last 2k that I really enjoyed was 2k16 because they tried on that 2k and it was balanced for the most part.
6218,This is a great game!
6219,not good
6220,"If you want to buy this game only for online multiplayer, I suggest to don't buy it. 
Lagging and crashing all the time (2lags/10sec)."
6221,"The gameplay is terrible, career mode is set up like a tv show, and the game mechanics during a game are clunky. Not even worth $8.99 . Save your money"
6222,no dribbles
6223,its very good game i love it
6224,They took off the option to disable NBA2kTV (forced ads in game). I bought this hoping the game would stop crashing (2k19 did this all the time periodically) but still getting crashes that completely wipe game progression.
6225,"for what it is, it's the best basketball game out so."
6226,Cheat Engine can bypass all pay walls and make you GOAT online as they have still failed to do anything to stop it.
6227,microtransactions up the ass fuck 2k
6228,the game is good
6229,nice game fun to play with teammates
6230,"Do you just want to play MyCareer and the occassional 2v2's or 3v3's on in the neighborhood? Well if you have the same mindset as I did, then youll enjoy the game. Its really not much of a step up from 2k19 but its still enjoyable and runs really well. To be honest I understand the hate the game gets but its still very fun to play."
6231,Great Game
6232,Good game
6233,This game has tons of glitch. Im glad i bought this game on sale and not full price.
6234,"PAY2WIN / BUG 2k20, PLS FIX THAT FUCKN BUGS!"
6235,"I purchased the full deluxe game for cheap on sale and do enjoy the game when it works but there are so many CTDs, VC being needed for anything, glacial progression in mycareer and the mycareer is so boring and takes control away from the player with forced camera. even though i do enjoy it I cannot recommend the game to other players. If they have an older version they should keep playing that and update the roster or buy the game is on sale like i did."
6236,"No guide. Almost no free-training system. Complicated control system. Delayed reaction. It took me 8 hours to realize I'm highly unlikely to enjoy this game, and by that time, I can no longer refund. Way to go, 2K!"

6242,"I don't know what is up with the reviews, but I personally find this game really good. The MyTeam and MyCareer modes are well structured and filled with variety of options. Go only for it only if there is a sale as 2K21 is coming out in a few months."

6251,"Cons-
1. lots of microtransactions. Not doing that. 
2. I'll end up buying basically the same game next year

Pros-
1. MyPlayer looks like me but is an addition 8 inches tall. That's a nice self esteem boost.
2. I won 15 MVP awards in a row in MyLeague. Am I the GOAT now?

Verdict-
I bought it. Odds are you have already too if you're reading this. You already know if you're gonna buy it or not."
6252,"Very fun, the best NBA game out there, though I don't think there are others so it doesn't have a lot of competition. It can feel a bit grindy, but you can easily make lots of progress just playing the game. I will say there are way too many absolutely garbage ploys to get you to pay more money for their crappy microtransactions, but you can make good progress without spending a penny. 

Pick it up for less than $10 and it's a fantastic deal. I wouldn't pay anything over that."
6253,DOPE game

6277,"Content is awesome. Gameplay is a little bit sticky and hard to understand... Offline play just awesome but if you are buying it for My Career Online Matching dont you even try to buy. All players are maxed their characters. Keep making 3 pts and 0 balance on teams. Also players understand that you are a beginner so they dont want to team up with you. So I can easily say there is no ranking system and you have to keep play against good players or 3 point spammers... 

Offline is ok. Only thing is some of the moves are not even realistic. For example when you want to drive in they keep holding you like you hit a wall. Its impossible push someone on attacking side and when you try to push your character holds ball. So dumb."

6283,Everything
6284,basketball
6285,Fun if you have friends. But if not you'll find yourself playing a bunch of hackers in the park and myteam.
6286,"if you wanna play NBA 2K with your friend offline this game is fuckin recommended for you guys, but if you wanna play this game online don't buy this on steam, just buy it on PS or Xbox, coz latency on pc is so WOOOOOOW :("
6287,i love this game
6288,It's a great game if you are bored and wanna kill some time.
6289,"If you like basketball, its the best one out. For a normal video game it isn't that great, its the same as last year with little to no updates."
6290,"This is a trash game, I played superstar difficulty ahead by 23 points against nets and the AI somehow cope up on that 4th quarter. The game was 1v9, it was my team against me also. No off boards from team even when we had 2-3 zone def and almost my centers and power forward was on the center of the court but for some reason couldn't rebound. It was the most unrealistic gameplay I ever played in my life. Thumbs down for this game mechanics, at least make a game that is realistic where in AI counts as real teammates rather that the user doing all the work. The programmer of the game is a retard."
6291,Best 2k So Far
6292,Nice game
6293,"LOL

6294,The game has too many issues and keeps crashing my PC. I spent almost three hours trying to adjust settings to get it to work right.
6295,rubbish game total cant play online..lag delay input ..rubbish server .. refund my money ZZZ
6296,Best 2K yet! I hope NBA 2k21 will be more better! Better gameplay is all we need..
6297,amazing
6298,"addictive and time consuming. so much different things to do
"
6299,"When in My career i have to watch them in the bench and the movements are getting slower and slower. tried the alt tab method it turns the game to a black screen that i need to restart my pc for it to work again. 

And i'm seeing threads that are dated back to 2019 and yet the bug is still not fixed..... 

if anyone can help me fix this please do so, because I can't refund the game anymore."
6300,This game literally cheats you in MyCareer mode to force you to purchase microtransactions for more credits and improve your player faster.
6301,A good sports game with an intriguing campaign story.
6302,its cool
6303,this game is not optimize for pc to play online
6304,awesome
6305,Really good game
6306,dead game online just beware
6307,gargantuan pile of doo doo but unfortunately still better than any other alternative
6308,.
6309,"This game sucks, but hoop is life. Why not?"
6310,"I got this in the humble bundle for racial justice and while I had sworn off the series and purchasing it after 2K19, I'm okay with playing MyLeague and nothing else. I'm okay with it because it's not the microtransaction riddled BS that MyCareer and MyTeam are. As someone who mainly played MyCareer, the way that it was designed around encouraging MTX was scummy, the neighborhood and the fact that there are ads EVERYWHERE (billboards, pop ups, the stores that are everywhere etc) was scummy, the fact that you can't skip timeouts until 5 seconds pass in MyCareer because they have to show you the gatorade ad was scummy. 

I could go on and on. The point is never, ever spend full price on this game. The simulation is good but 2K made so much of it worse with their greed that I can't recommend it even if I keep playing it."
6311,"It is alright. Compared to 2K19, a little more challenging which i like i guess."
6312,everything
6313,Wasn't fun
6314,"najs men i ja sam

6315,good
6316,If i never get hackers sure but it has em and i cant be one of em

6341,Lets play together
6342,"It's a good game, gameplay wise. I have yet to test the graphical limits of this game because my PC is almost a decade old and itching for an upgrade, but with the right setting tweaks, I can run this on 1080p low shader setting and no special effects at 60fps with minimal stutters due to CPU bottleneck. Also, this game is probably only worth buying if it's on sale (which I did) and you only want to play myleague or mycareer, or on a physical preorder because of the free poster you can get with the Legend edition.

PC UPGRADE UPDATE: I've finally tried the online portion of the game, and it's just terrible. I have a good fiber optic internet connection, but since the servers are not even optimized for my country, it takes probably like 250ms to move my player or do anything. But at least the singleplayer portion of every game mode is okay. Still not worth the full price. Only recommending this because I like it more than I hate it, plus I'm a total pleb for basketball games."

6359,Unrealistic and basically a bad re-skin of 2k19 dont buy this trash.
6360,L
6361,"felt rip off even though i only spent $12 getting it. I didn't have high expectation to begin with. I only bought it cuz this year team are more even and competitive. but it manages to fall through a low expectation.  AI is stupid, most of them cant shoot even if their life depends on it. i had Danny green out rebound Gannis on multiple occasion.  My career mode is a grind feast so u either pay up or the player suck for long time as in cant even do a cross-over without losing dribble"
6362,"Great gameplay destroyed by bugs and insane balance issues. MyPlayer is awful. Kill it in practice, and summer league getting 30pts a game, then literally can't hit one shot in the regular season!? Tried multiple builds, it's all the same. This is a pay to win for sure. Very dissapointing, because other than that it's fun. Also have an issue with the A.I being nailed with the 3-second violation. I hope 2k21 is better. This makes me wanna play the older 2k games. You'll have fun if you're looking to play quick play games. That's it."
6363,Microtransactions
6364,"MyTeam is the only viable game mode if you're not planning on buying VC (as you should). Despite many flaws, it is indeed the best basketball game we have."
6365,Micro-transactions on career modes make absolutely no sense on a sports game... unless you are the devs of course. Same as last year pretty much everywhere. Extremely boring story for career mode. Stupid videos from NBA2K TV... should I continue?
6366,My player feels like he is taking his first steps after getting in a 13 car pile up. The AI Teammates were in the same pile up and received severe brain damage so they forgot how to defend. The animations are janky as fuck and take years to play after pressing the button. 2K forgot how to make games.
6367,I'm addicted.
6368,"This game is not fun. (Caveat: I have played primarily in MyCareer mode. YMMV in other modes, but I feel like my criticisms apply to the gameplay, mainly - or, at least, the way the game plays against you.)

It's not fun to run and then suddenly stop for no reason. It's not fun to feel like you're constantly running in mud unless you have a 99 speed rating. It's not fun to shoot from three feet away instead of completing a dunk/lay-up - and then still miss. It's not fun to consistently pass to the wrong player, no matter that they were highlighted when you pressed to pass. It's not fun to step out of bounds over and over again because the momentum in this game is broken. It's not fun to step out of bounds yourself and then watch the CPU take the same sprint you did and stay in-bounds.

It's not fun that steals are arbitrarily scripted and percentage based. It's not fun that the only consistent way to score is to hit the ridiculously tight timing window, regardless of your shooting skill. It's not fun when you do manage to get a steal and the CPU catches up anyway, regardless of how far out in front you were at the start of the fastbreak. It's not fun when the opposing team rubber bands ALL the way back from a 30 point lead when you and your CPU teammates all miss the next 10 shots in a row, because you can't possibly hit the timing/the CPU teammates simply stop rushing the basket/the opposing team starts playing 100% impenetrable defense.

This game makes the player feel like it's not so much what they do to win, but what the CPU does to [i]allow[/i] you to win. And that's not fun."
6369,Scuffed game with annoying and sometimes game breaking bugs that will persist throughout the whole gameplay. Pay2Play with a massive grinding backbone to it. Just bought it to learn more about the sport and thank god I bought it while it was on sale.
6370,Nice game easy to play
6371,"I absolutely love this game! Although, i do wish that the shooting mechanics were a little easier. It is very difficult for new players. Please make it easier, US new players would like to enjoy MyCareer without destroying our PC's or other consoles! :) THANK YOU....

One thing that I didn't like was how free agency status of any created players was handled, come on free agency has a limited roster slots! Technically every person not signed to an NBA contract is a free agent?"

6383,Online matchmaking is garbage. Single player is garbage. Really regret spending my money on this.
6384,honestly didnt expect to like it and kind of just bought it to raise my steam account value. its really fun tbh and i recommend it for anyone who like the sport of basket ball. Definatley should purchase when on sale would never pay full price
6385,As bad as Madden now.
6386,good
6387,"TLDR: For the best offline experience, play MyLeague (with player lock or normal team). MyCareer, while started nicely with the story, looks like 2k17 (where your teamates are awful and opponents godlike).

PROS:
- My League is improved
- Graphics and gameplay are decent (if you control the entire team !!)
- MyCareer archetypes are better than 17 but still not as good as the old 2k (where you could build the player as you wanted) 

CONS:
- P2W (I mean look at MyTeam and MyCareer/neighborhood). Even EA doesn't make its ""MyPlayer"" so grindy
- MyCareer teamates & gameplay: they are beyond stupid. Attempt shots even myself I wouldn't dare
- MyCareer opponent AI = OP. Every game, they get around 70% shooting and me (Houston Rockets) around 35%. What am I suppose to do as a rebounding center? Chase down the wide open 3s? Stop teamates attempt to shoot instead of doing a layup with no one around them?"
6388,"Great game, great graphics, a slight upgrade over last year's version (mostly cosmetic, but that certainly counts in my book). I don't look to play online with strangers, so I ignore all the VC btiching and just concentrate on the gameplay, the flow of the game, and it's great. 
Granted, I waited for it to go on sale for less than $10. It's definitely worth that price."
6389,"nice game 
"
6390,"Nba 2k has constantly deteriorated over the years. I guess that's what happens when there's no competition. 
Mycareer may aswell be called cutscene skip simulator 2k20 and the gameplay is worse than ever. They should stop paying big names to be in this shit game and actually use that money to make a good game."

the thing is, i cant even play online.. it's so laggy and try reconnecting everytime i play in neighbor..nothing's wrong with my connection..

i agree with people saying 2k is so greedy.. i mean they make ton of money from this, right? and yet they couldn't fix the server problem..

and 2k need to chill about decreasing teammate grade, you lose more than half of your grade if you foul.. i mean foul is part of the basketball.."
6397,yesd
6398,....
6399,best
6400,"yes, this game is very well to play, although there's a lot of crazy people with cheat"
6401,loving that the mavs are contenders again :)
6402,"Awful online experience. No anti-cheat in the park, someone with a higher rep can just take your place in a game no matter how long you've been waiting, no matchmaking unless you go in Rec Center (but it takes forever to actually find a game) or play Pro-Am (you need a team and it's competitive play), MyCareer is basically Grind simulator (unless you pay for VCs but even buying 200k won't get your guy at a 90. MyTeam is basically a big pay to win. Can't get good cards unless you decide to stop living a real life and just play that game for the rest of your life (unless you give 2K all your family's savings, in which case you may pull some good cards). No changes have been made to MyLeague since last year. Only real improvement they made is bring the WNBA in the game, which is pretty good, but I don't play PlayNow. Unfortunately it's the only BasketBall game out there so 2K can do whatever they want. Please don't buy 2K21."
6403,good

6419,"I mean it's 2k
"
6420,Controls for mycareer suck nothing really improved it seems EA put little to no effort into polishing the game and gave us an unfinished product.
6421,"This game is fucking garbage. If you're only interested in playing the solo MyCareer mode instead of online, don't waste your money either pirate the game or go do something else. MyCareer mode starts your character at a point where they literally drool on themselves for entire games. Can't make a basket, ball gets stolen from you every time you get passed to, any time you try to pass the CPU will literally snatch it out of midair. You think the game would get better by the time your character hits 90+ overall rating. Nope. Then the CPU will stick a character onto you like glue, no way to get separation so instead of your character sucking, they essentially play against the greatest defensive player the world has ever seen except it happens every single game against every single team. The only reason I have put any time into this game is because it was given to me for free and I was playing in hopes it would get better. Stay far away if you're looking for a solo experience in a basketball game, it will literally cheat you out of wins and there is no way of telling what games it will happen."
6422,Must have an autistic amount of dedication or cheats to play this game online... also make sure you have 100GB of free space for nothing but unimportant cut-scenes and wii graphics.
6423,pp
6424,Wtf is wrong with this game. I just downloaded it yesterday and ive been facing fps lag in a huge amount.
6425,For $9 this game is definitely worth it as I won't need to buy another NBA 2k until 2023. The MyCareer mode is not bogged down by as much storyline as previous years and is mostly just about playing.
6426,Giannis 2019-20 MVP
6427,"There used to be a time in video game history where you could simply create your player - plug him into your favorite team and play your own imaginary season with your favorite team that never wins anything in real life. 

That's all I wanted to do for $14.99 while on Summer Sale.  I figured $14.99 can't be that much to pay for all of the above, right?  Welp, I was wrong. 

I was completely lost in the myriad of options that are focused around MyTeam, MyCareer, MyCasino, MyPlayerPacks, MyEvolutionPacks, MyLegends, MyTV, MyDynasty, etc. 

From annoying hosts who introduce every in-game option with an unskippable movie explaining every last feature in bludgeoning detail to the 10,000 create-a-shoe options, I have no idea how console players put up with this agonizing experience every year. 

After 47 minutes of pure frustration, I hit the refund button.  I don't know if this game is good or not.  But I do know that basketball is not the focus of this.  It is simply a commodity, a backdrop to be used to showcase whatever the hell card pack simulation this is.   

I will NEVER, EVER buy another NBA game again from 2K.  Not on Steam.  Not even for free.  Get this out of my library now."

6455,I Actually really like NBA2K20 on PC because players are so cheap on my team and I can just plug in my Xbox remote I have this game on Xbox but that's the downside no one plays on PC the servers are bad but to be honest people complain about hackers I have never seen one EU servers might have none I don't know but I have played a fair amount of gameplay on PC and Xbox to give my opinion I would not buy at full price wait until its on sale like right now July 5th 2020 its £10 for legend edition and that's a amazing price!
6456,เป็นเกมบาสเกตบอลที่ภาพสวยและสมจริงมากๆ มีหลายโหมดให้เลือกเล่น เช่น โหมดเนื้อเรื่องที่ให้เราสร้างตัวละครของเราขึ้นมาเองแล้วนำไปเล่น หรือโหมดที่ให้อิสระกับเราในการที่เราจะเลือกเล่นทีมไหนก็ได้หรือสู้กับทีมไหนก็ได้ ก็ถือว่าเป็นเกมกีฬาที่สนุกอีกเกมนึงเลย

6462,"Even tho l don't rly want to play online, l need to be online to be able to play offline my career, and most of the time l get error there is problem with my connection even tho l can connect to my team servers.
If you just started to play with team around avg 80 rating, u will get matchup with people with 95+ rating every damn time.
Playing online with delay, very unfun exp overall, wouldn't recommend buying it even on sale for 8$ is not worth it.

6469,"Terrrible... I wish I never paid the $8.95 for this game. First I've bought since 2016 and such a let down.

I don't get how this company can put out such trash having a complete monopoly on the NBA. Such a let down.

I'll try again in 2024.

"
6470,"This game is hot garbage, if you pay full price for this Im sorry. words cannot describe the emotions of hate, anger, self loathing, and more anger while playing this game. There has been no mechanics update since who knows when. worst 8 dollars I have spent on a AAA game DONT BUY THIS GAME ITS NOT WORTH IT."
6471,cool
6472,<3
6473,"As a core basketball game, it is good. The mode where you can make your own league and play offline is excellent, and aside from a crash here-and-there or the AI making an unreasonably high percentage just so you lose, you can find glimmers of greatness.

The problems are everywhere else. Imagine you bought a premium videogame that plays commercials for Kias that you can't skip before playing a game. Imagine being asked for money for microtransactions every time you play the game. Imagine broken game play that has plagued 2K for generations and instead of fixing it, they add more transactions. This is what you are bombarded with. You can type in a locker code to unlock a card but you don't unlock the card. You are made to play a game that gives you odds on winning that card and even when you play the game correctly you still don't win the card. This game FEELS like a free to play app on your phone. 2K has made excellent basketball games in the past, as the years go on, they update the roster and give you more ways to spend real world money on it. That is all this game is, it is a cash grab, it is blatant, and unabashed in its tactics. Buy it really cheap for the offline modes, but 80% of the game is bad."
6474,good
6475,lmao how do they manage to make these games worse every year
6476,This game couldn't be any worse. The reviews should've been a tell tale sign but I took a chance with it being on sale. The AI is absolutely terrible. Hitting jump shots with a player with 85+ ratings is dam near impossible.  Trying to play defense is a joke. AI will constantly miss wide open shots on your passes and never hit the screens you set. 2k15 Blows this game out of the water. Hope Steam will refund me for this sad excuse of a game.
6477,Nba 2k is Not like Real Basketball. Too many unrealistic things occur which kills the gameplay experience. Wait for 2k21 cause this game is Not Good.
6478,If you can forgive the microtransaction centric BS the game itself is solid.

6487,"Played pretty much all the nba2k games and this one seems to be the worst for the amount of bugs and inconsistencies. Be it crashes and lockups or just bugs in the game, like when you on the bench and you want to skip to your next shift it takes forever to load the button trigger. I'd avoid this one. The interesting thing is I never had this trouble on the ps4 version when I played it. I'm glad I got it on the steam summer sale and didn't pay full price for it. Even then its not really worth it. 

Hopefully the new one does better...ill probably not chance it and pick it up on ps4/ps5 though just to avoid any headaches"

6501,"Pros 
- Outstanding simulator with seemingly limitless options.
- Many enjoyable single player experiences

Cons
- Online Play is literally nothing but hackers.  They don't even hide it because nothing is ever done.
- Animation locks make the gameplay feel clunky.

Comments
- Pulling up for a 5 foot jumper when driving to an open basket...
- Missing several uncontested short shots while the computer pulverizes you with endless contested threes...
- Practice finally feels even slightly meaningful!  If only for a short time...

I really enjoy this game for it's single player applications.  Online play is trash on PC.  Don't bother unless you can hack the game yourself.

P.S. - All Around Threat isn't even a possible ""My Player"" build, but everyone has it.  And what's with the 50 foot arms going around these days?"

6524,"I played an entire season in My Career, and at the end of it I was just mostly angry at the bullshit systems in place. The shot meter means almost nothing, and it feels like the game punishes you arbitrarily for scoring a lot by then giving you a horrible streak in the next quarter or something. It feels like the AI is not good enough to play good ball, and so they find some behind the scenes way to screw you over, even if you have good timing and are getting open with a quality player. 

This is my second time playing an NBA2K game, and the most I've played one by far, but I wish it felt in any way fair to play. It's mostly just frustrating."
6525,"wow
"
6526,"I just couldn't help myself, despite knowing what previous years have brought with NBA 2K games. I've already requested a refund at the time of writing this review. Even though the game is 85% off.

I'll explain why. 

For me the most fun part of the NBA games is the MyGM mode. So its what I went straight into with this game. First of all, the expansion teams were gone. So you couldn't start off as an expansion team, the first red flag. Since previous games had this. Next the MyGM mode doesn't allow you to choose between starting the season straight away or starting in the off-season. You start in the season. Second red flag. You are consistently given tasks as soon as there is a space for one. Which wouldn't be a bad thing, but the Head Coach for the most part just wanted me to trade players. So I had to choose between doing the trades for experience to unlock skill points or ignore the tasks which makes him dislike and distrust you. Another red flag. Unlocking chit chat seems to be an important part of the skill tree because with it you can build a small amount of trust and morale boosts, without it you'll might end up struggling with poor trust and morale problems. More red flags. You almost have to do an action everyday of the season or end the day, because if you decide to skip the week instead and a team wants to make a trade offer. You can't stop the skip and look at the offer if you decide to skip the week.  Plus one to the red flag pile. The final straw that breaks me. Going into the draft no one on the staff has mentioned who I should draft, so I draft whoever I want. Only for after the draft the head coach to tell me who he wants me to draft (its already too late) and the right away after that gets mad at me for not drafting the player he wanted when the draft was already over!

That's at least 6 different problems or choices that have been removed from previous iterations of NBA 2K. F*****g 6, that I noticed within 2 hours of MyGM mode! I had low expectations buying this game, but when you ruin my personal favourite aspect of the game. There is nothing left for me. I could go on about other things as well like a story mode version being gone or the fact that certain actions are now behind a skill point progression system. But I can't be bothered wasting my time anymore. Should have learned my lesson from the 2k19, but at least this time I should get a refund."
6527,"Great game, but a lil bit lag when i play it online"
6528,"I don't understand the complaints, but I'm also a dude who just solo plays myleague."
6529,"good game
"
6530,"Badges are the most important part of the game, incredibly frustrating if you want a basketball sim not a basketball rpg. Genuinely the worst sports game I have ever played, this game is fucking trash"
6531,terrible game but i'm addicted

6533,Good game bro
6534,"Constant crashes.  Some cunting developer added a super noisy helicopter that doesn't respond to the normal sound settings.  All guides on how to fix problems are generic bullshit about out of date drivers and overclocking.  Laziest big banking game in the world, on par with GTA."

6536,"Game is ass
"
6537,"Simply, the best simulation for an NBA fan."
6538,"I'll start by saying this is still a fun game that I'll probably play a fair amount. That being said I got it on sale for like 11$. DO NOT BUY for any more than that.

Pros: 
I miss basketball because of the quarantine
The my career story mode made me laugh a bunch

Cons:
Nothing is done to make my life easier as a keyboard player. All the drill instructions are only shown as if I had a controller so I constantly have to check the key bindings to know what to do.
Controls seem unresponsive sometimes, most notably movement and rebounding
Settings DON'T SAVE: every time i launch the game i need to switch it to full screen mode but much worse is that EVERY TIME i sub into the game I need to change the camera mode because the default sucks AND when ever i sim to my next appearance i have to tab out and in to the game multiple times to actually make it work.

In conclusion I really want to like this game more than I do, the last 2k game i played on PC was 2k14 and it's mindblowing that things like the lack of keyboard ""support"" and control issues are the exact same with the addition of settings not saving. Otherwise the gameplay is the exact same but with better graphics and imo a worse music selection than 2k14. Sure I should play with a controller but I don't have one and haven't really looked into getting one. But why should I spend upwards of 80$ on a controller I'd probably use for 1 game?

Thank you for coming to my ted talk. 2k Sports do better."

6541,good game
6542,"Game is shit for PC, dont buy it!!! still shit"
6543,"Of course its extremely similar as last year's game, but I think it has an extremely good single-player experience."
6544,"So I think I have given this game a fair amount of time to give a fair review. 
At this point I am over 300 hours into playing this game. I have NOT spent any money on VC and play the modes I find playable and I guess the least annoying. 

Lets start with my team. Uhh no thank you. Its an over priced mode that you basically get the honor of spending money on collecting worthless cards that disappear on you. yeah Ill pass. Never really collected sports cards in real life not going to start now. Totally not into playing a mode that basically you have to get lucky to get cards for players Id want to play as while using players I wouldnt want to play as. So this is a huge pass. 

My career was not fun as it was way to short and buggy. By buggy I mean scripted so no matter how you play it all the games end how they want them to. How is that fun. It was not about skill. it was not about learning how to play the game or against the AI. It was basically being annoyed that the games were all scripted and if you do something not in the game, you are punished. SHoot a green while up 25 points, well you'll miss or your charater will freeze, or do something dumb. The scripted game play was so frustrating to say the least. I have a 94 overall and never seen a game work so hard at cheating me out of winning. Cheating is me being nice. It is literally design to force losses on you. If it was because the AI played better I wouldn't be upset. No it has nothing to do with that. 2k thinks you should loss a certain amount of games even if you save up enough VC to get a decent player. and play it. with great stats and have a great team. 

Now I have not gotten into VC which currently I get 2k a game. If i want to start another character I would need to play 100 games just to get to 85. That is insane. Took me 300+ hours just to get to 94. I tried the crap on youtube get to 99.9 in a day. Doesnt work.  

I buy games to have fun and win or be challenged. not to lose constantly with no way of winning. The AI constantly cheats. This is the really issues I have and Why my first experience with a 2k game has made me never to want to play another 2k game ever again and makes me feel cheated and ripped off like I was playing a rigged carnival game. 
 Lets keep going...
FOULS.....

Block a shot foul... steal a ball foul..... like seriously I go to steal a ball and myplayer will dive into the AI and makes no sense, Leaving me going why. it makes no sense. Even after watching tons of videos on how to steal correctly, which btw makes no sense and is completely not intuitive but hey I went with it, and still get constant fouls gets worse the further a head I am.  But my favorite is how easly the AI can block me or steal from me. I bump AI player just stole my ball. It is just dumb. its different rules for AI and me which makes learning so annoying.

Honestly I say stay away from all 2k games. after watching countless videos Trying to figure out why it is so hard and figuring out how to play, AND FINALLY I figured out HOW TO DO MOST THINGS. Yet somethings are still beyond me.

So I am now here and I can honestly say that it didn't matter if you are good or not the game has scripted things that are meant to happen. SO if you suck it makes you seem good so you keep playing the game, and if you are good it screws you over and makes you want to quit.


Oh I totally didnt bring up
I can green all day and play perfect defense and still spend more time on the bench than I should be. SO that the AI can catch up and pass my team and win. Let me explain, At first I thought I was being benched for fouling to much. SO i spent alot of time trying to learn how not to foul. Stopped blocking stopped stealing. Nope still benched. Why did I buy this game.... oh yeah I bought it so i can be benched constantly and have no control over weather I win or lose. Yep that's Why i buy games. So the AI can play the game. Not like I bought the game to play it. Nope Never buy games to play them. Who wants to have an impact on a game I bought. So I though okay I'll saved up a bunch of VC lets make a new player maybe its the postion and spend that vc and see how it goes. Yeah it doesn't matter 

Basically I got lucky and got this on a discount. even that being said I still feel like I was ripped off. I shall never buy another carnival rigged game by 2k game ever again. I should of listened to the reviews and researched the game better, and watched more videos before I got this game. but I just wanted to play a basketball game I guess I will just sit on this bench and watch the AI play till the score is where 2k thinks it should be and take the lose. This will be the last one I buy. Be smart and stay away this is just trash"

6560,"Maybe this game is not different from the previous parts, but the atmosphere is impressive. EA won't do anything even close to that. Compared to NBA, FIFA and NBA Live looks like a beginner's job.

As a beginner in basketball games, the bad thing for me is that there is no good tutorial in the game. I literally spent about 20 minutes to figure out how to play a free game (practice arena), to at least understand the controls. You should add all your drills to the practice arena, not just for MyPlayer mode."

6598,"This game is the sum of human suffering condensed into 100 gigabytes.

No action no matter how insignificant goes unpunished. Want to make your player's surname ""Basketball""? Let's just take 2 full minutes to check whether or not that name contains profanity.

There's presumably basketball at some point, but reaching the court is an arduous journey through a bizarre UI, self-congratulatory FMVs and seas of product placement. Sports games are known for being repackaged versions of last year's game, and this one is out to prove you wrong by drowning you in gimmicks like being able to design your own Nike Air Jordan™ shoes with a level of detail that far exceeds the customization possible in the character editor. The whole thing feels like it was made by firing trademarks at each other in a particle accelerator.

There's your usual money grab modes if you want to play pachinko instead of basketball, but I can't comment on those because I can't think of anything I'd like to contribute to the funding of less than a potential NBA2K21.

The game's one redeeming feature is that it will frequently crash to spare you from having to continue playing it."

I will be getting 2k21 on console without a doubt unless 2k implements cross play or improves connection and make the game smooth. Its only the biggest basketball series.

6633,hey wtf! wtf this my career!!!!! when i play on the road its so easy to score but when its our homecourt its so fucking hard to score! wtf is this? we bought this game and theres shit happening!!!! please do balance gameplay.
6634,nice i like lebron beard
6635,blm
6636,"amazing
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
6637,"It seems that most of the bad reviews are about online play. I dislike online play in any game, so my review is only for the single-player experience, which is definitely superior to any NBA2K game so far. That said, it's not all roses, and sometimes I wish Steam had a star-based ratings system instead of binary thumbs up/down, in which case I'd probably give this game 3 or 4 stars. FWIW I skipped the last few versions of NBA2K, the last version I played was '17.

The good:
- Looks incredible, runs really well even on slightly older hardware (NVidia GTX 980 here)
- The ""story"" is well-written and good, though it does seem somewhat short and hastily produced
- Gameplay feels much more natural than previous versions
- Team practice is actually effective at tuning specific skills! It's no longer a complete drag
- Ability to take over the coaching plan is interesting, though I haven't really dug into that part of the game yet
- Classic teams, WNBA, etc., are all welcome additions

The bad:
- I ABSOLUTELY HATE that you can't listen to the 2K beats stream in the game! This is really crazy, especially when the soundtrack is so good! You can only listen to it in the main menu, what a waste.
- I was dismayed to find many bugs and defects still haven't been sorted out since I last played in NBA2K17. For instance:
  - There is no league-wide setting for minutes/quarter, which is quite ridiculous. This means that all games in the league use 12-minute quarters except for the ones you play, which (by default) have 6-minute quarters. This skews all league-wide statistics and makes it more difficult to compare your team to others. In the stats view, you CAN get a per 100 possessions breakdown, but that's about it. Player stats (like scoring) of course assume 12-minute quarters.
  - Every time the scene cuts, the clothing on all players jumps. It's very visually disrupting
- It's not possible to skip all the pre-game garbage and so-on. It's cool at first, but once you are chugging into a full 82-game season it becomes redundant
- Some obvious roster differences exist in the game. Far before 2K20 was released, it was widely known that players such as Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson would miss the entire season. But in the game, they are perfectly healthy. Good luck beating Brooklyn at full strength!"
6638,"I enjoy this game so much, this is the first NBA game that i bought and i litteraly enjoyed it. Since now it's 4,99$ you should buy it and live a good life :)"
6639,YEA YEA YEA
6640,"Horrible game. It's supposed to be a basketball simulator, but it's not. The player ratings are just dumb, every player is throwing the ball from half court and hitting it. It doesn't make sense. Don't buy it."
6641,"Good if you never own a 2k game, else everything is almost the same every year"
6642,"Perhaps the most shitty 2k or even the most shitty game I've ever played. Shit server, shit balance, crap control. Believe me this game only worth 5 dollar."
6643,Good af

6645,"Butchered the Knicks 94 & 98-99 teams. I get you can't get some people like Chris Childs/ Kurt Thomas bit FUCCIN A, FILL THE NEEDS. Not some random white dudes ALL power forwards. Not playing the Casino my player shit so you can forget that. Blow me. At least Playgrounds is good. Only a matter of time before 2k shits on that. But thanks 2k, my last sim I'm buying even if its 10 cash again."
6646,nice
6647,"Note: I haven't played online yet.
I've stuck to franchise, and the game is in depth for sure. I'm usually a Madden player (which is funny seeing the complaints on this game, because EA has legit exponentially had the same problems, but longer.

That said, I like to keep things short and sweet.
Would I buy the game for the full $60? Probably not
Would I buy it on sale for $20 or less? Absolutely.
Feel free to use that measurement to make your decision"
6648,Im gonna give it a yes if you just want too mess around with mods thats why I bought it and another reason I give it a yes because the offline is great but if you are just buying this to play myteam or my career have fun everyone is a hacker you might as well just buy a used xbox or ps4 if you wanna see the whole good experience but overall only buy the game if its on sale or if you wanna mess with mods or myteam hacks
6649,The Best
6650,Nice game for you who likes basketball and huge fan of NBA

6655,"This game saved my life.

I am 55.

My ex-wife and I had a son together, and adopted our daughter together. Both are 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you Platinum Games."
6656,ballin' everidai bruh
6657,it is what it is . it's a nice game.
6658,"For game from sales costs 7,49€ is it definittly worth!"
6659,For someone who didn't played NBA 2k in last 10 years this game plays and looks amazing. Had soo much fun just playing training and quick matches with something like LA Lakers all stars. But everything else in this game is just Garbage. My career is just a joke. Something that suppose to keep me wanting to come back to play it just simply destroyed fun completely. Only paid 6£ for that game that I regret spending lol. I would rather pay full price  for decent game instead of paying real money in game  just so my player could keep up with the team.
6660,this game is so buggy its unbelievable
6661,yeah it really is basketball
6662,ball up
6663,i love that you can customise your character
6664,"Game is decent, the MyPlayer Sim System is broken. Would have to switch screens and come back to the game or ctrl+alt+delete for it to work. Really considering shelving this game or requesting my money back. A simple function of the game should work, 2K Sports, get it fixed."

6673,"Buy this game if.

- You like being punished for not having an encyclopedic knowledge of basketball.
- You like being punished for AI Teammates mistakes.
- You like being punished for letting star players go past you.
- You like being punished.
- If you like your teammates playing keepaway with you.

In myleague mode I accidentally accessed some on-court tactics mode thing and it took precedence over controlling my player, it's almost as if the AI could sense this so they relentlessly dunked on my while my players were stationary, that is just straight up broken, I ended up losing off the confidence loss from that and I was very shaken, this is just broken and unacceptable.

It could use some real training, this 2KU thing isn't good enough to really get you used to the skills you need in the game, the drills all use terms that you need to be a basketball fans to know, like ""Do a post-fade jump shot"" And I'm thinking ""You might as well tell me to do a flooptydoop"" because I have no idea what ""Post fade jump shot"" means, stop punishing people for not knowing everything.

I got this game on sale and if I would have paid full price I'd be demanding a refund."
6674,"i know this game is pay to win but i think its okay for ""summer sale"" price. I love the graphics and gameplay. I only hate the shot meter but its okay. overall this is the best basketball game yeah because there is no basketball game except this game. So buy if you love nba or basketball but dont buy if you want the balance and perfect game"

6687,Fuck you Ronnie2k
6688,Don't buy this game. They are selling it for lower price because they can't fix the ongoing issue. There are lot of issues about this game. You can only play the mycareer mode in 60hz below video settings. Sometimes it randomly crashes. Played only mycareer mode for a short period of time because i kept getting an error code: 727e66ac that says i need to visit their page about the status that says all of their servers are okay. Tried contacting 2k support but it seems that they can't fix it. All of my progress will be a waste now since i can't play mycareer mode using my player. Steam aslo can't refund the game even though i can't play it online.

6695,2k19 2.0
6696,"I initially gave this game a positive review but after playing for a bit more, I have to say this is the worst 2k game I have ever played, much worse than even 2k18. Online servers are absolute garbage, impossible to play without severe lag. MyTeam has went to shit, nearly every player has their own diamond or pink diamond card, this takes away any realism the tiers have had in the past. Lastly, playing the game against the CPU is awful. Impossible to balance the game where the CPU is competitive but not cheesing you on every play. If you want a somewhat realistic CPU that matches your skill level but also keeps the game somewhat realistic, be prepared to spend countless hours adjusting sliders. Also, there seems to be minor input lag when it comes to jump shot releases, which makes hitting jump shot random and not skill based whatsoever. In conclusion, this is an awful 2k game."

6709,the reviews it had i was skeptical about the game but for the price of 12$ which i payed it was a bargain  and it was a really good game
6710,After putting out almost the same exact game for so many years how has it not improved at all? Absolute trash product.
6711,"This is easily the worst sports game i've ever played in my life, can't wait to see what they have in store for the next year, don't make the mistake of buying it unless it's less than 5 bucks (i'm being generous)."

6716,"i'm new at NBA games so I tried NBA 2K11 few days ago because it was voted the best of the series in a few sites. I did enjoy 2K11, could try 2K12 soon since it's voted as the best in few other sites.

Now I bought 2K20 since it had this discount and ran it. And WOW I hated this game immediately straight from the menu screen. It's all uncomfortable to navigate. Didn't even bother to go into the gameplay as I only made it to the 1 minute of exhibition before figuring out the controls. Realizing how unresponsive everything was and how I need to double-select before proceeding from one option to another I, someone with high standards for gameplay smoothness and not much of a bother for graphics decided ""This is not worth the headache, I'm heading out.""

Fuck these recently released games."
6717,great!

6725,"The only sports game I will play is NBA and that's rare.. for playing it on PC it runs pretty smooth and looks decent I just wish the facial scanner would work better on the app but overall fun to play alone or with friends 
I also feel this game is great for anyone trying to sit back and shoot some hoops!
I wanna also be fair and say that I have only played a few selected NBA games ranging from 2009 up to 2012 and stopped there but this game is nice coming back to after not playing any NBA games for a while.
7.5/10
I prefer the olders but who doesn't 


Also I just wish someone would finally add UFC to PC"

6742,"this game sucks!!!. here are my reasons:

1. my wide open shots are missed while theirs are guaranteed points. slightly early, 4% contested shot made by james harden or curry is still a miss. 

2. my AI teammates keep giving fouls (and 1) whenever i'm closing the gap or i'm gaining momentum. this is garbage tactics by the game. screw you 2k 

3. The steals. oh my god the steals. just drive towards the hoops, bump on to enemy PF and oops, ball's gone. i have yet to do that to an AI.   

i dont know. maybe i just suck at playing.

6773,really nice game
6774,"First off, when the game doesn't decide to just close or go slow motion it's good.

Ironically enough after the BLM propaganda video played, it now constantly crashes making My Career mode unplayable. I thought I was buying a video game not a propaganda machine for democrats. I don't care about anyone's views I just want to sit down and enjoy a freakin video game, but no I have to be slapped with politics."

6782,I paid that game 12$ canadians and I still feel like i've been robbed
6783,so here is 2k on pc in a nutshell. do you like waiting for 12 minutes for a park game only to have some hacker come up and boot you off your spot and have your time wasted ? no then dont buy this.

6790,"Wow... just horrible, not even worth the $9"
6791,crashes all the time
6792,Best 2k ever made ever!
6793,Stay away from any of the online modes like MyCareer and MyTeam especially and you will enjoy the game. It is the best basketball game out there and 2k will probably have the dominant basketball game for a long time. You are able to make your own player in MyLeague and have him drafted and then use player lock to get a MyCareer gamemode without a cringy story and grindy gameplay. Otherwise doing the playoffs with a fantasy draft makes for some really good teams and series.
6794,"if u dont get this u r bad

MyCareer. idk if anyone else has this problem but i miss running around your court in 2k17 and just taking shots before your game. they took that out here. gameplay is alright but honestly i saw someone say if you have any game from the last 5 years don't bother. its literally rinsed and repeated. do something better.

6831,"I don't know why I come back to this game even though it's the same every year. 
TL:DR - I'm leaving a positive review only because it is better than 2K19 (Left a negative one on that), if you don't mind spending for 2K and wants to get the 19-20 roster, go ahead, especially during the sale. I will list down the things that are better below:
 
-The UI's layout and design in the game. You go into your MyCareer static page first before you hop into Neighborhood. You don't have to load the world to go into the animations store.
-Camera work is slightly better, no first-person view when sitting out the game, new cutscenes during pre-game.
-You can choose your specialization badge freely, which is pretty great.
-Movement is more realistic compared to the previous one, deciding to shoot will cost you a few milliseconds more.
-Waiting for your next appearance became interesting, instead of a simple fading to black transition.
-WNBA
-You can play Draft Combine and Summer League during the prologue.

Now.. for the cons:

-Graphically identical to 2K19. You wont notice a difference, at least to me it didn't.
-Timeouts are still a waste of time for them to show their sponsors.
-Story sucked compared to the last one, didn't even cared for my own character let alone the others. Short too.

Will list as I play more..."
6832,Please do not buy this game this game is very glitchy and dissapointing if you are just starting this game the park is just full of legend 95overalls and alot of sweats and mycareer's simulations are broken causing you too just have to watch the game and not be able to simulate to the next possetion. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THANK YOU

I'd played every nba 2k up until 2k13 since that was the last one for ps3 and then i stopped buying consoles.  every single 2k since for pc was always full price on steam and then pulled once the new one came out.  2k20 has been the only one that went on sale.  so at sale price, i'm fine with it.  especially since 2019 was a short nba season and 2020 could be no season, this is all the nba we've got right now.  if 2k21 comes on at full price, i'm probably just going to stick with 2k20.  i also tried blacktop mode 1 on 1 and that was fun."
6836,modded
6837,goodgame
6838,Best NBA game to date! Great improvement to the AI and Smoother animations make this a big step up for the franchise.
6839,Yeah
6840,I absolutely hate 2K games Not only are they terrible on PC platforms because of glitches But they also don't do much to improve the game play from one year to the next
6841,"Trash, but good"
6842,"Real good to play on pc no bugs no glitches, pure amazing"
6843,fun but lots of hackers no one plays with you only if you get lucky . but it is fun if like basket ball
6844,lot of hackers but its good
6845,good
6846,"the last 2k game i played was 2k18, but 2k18 feels so much more responsive than this one. in that, players move quickly and accurately, whereas in 2k20 your players feel clunky and slow"
6847,I love it!
6848,Lebron Jaims
6849,i like it
6850,"after my comments for cheaters on 2k19, i found this on sale...
damn, its all the same, same cheating people and 2K dont bother to do anything for that.
why? why cheating on a game? why?"
6851,good
6852,LIXO
6853,IT'S A FUCKING RETARD GAME. THE GAME CRASH WHEN I FINISH THE CHAMPIONSHIP AND THERE ARE A LOT OF HACKERS :(((((( -REP
6854,ashiap
6855,amazing
6856,2k sucks
6857,game has too many glitchs.
6858,"Where to start! Well first of all the fps cuts between 60 and 20 constantly, the game freezes hitches and sound glitches. Oh and the best part is the multiplayer! Where whatever you do wherever you go, or whatever you shoot, if you get mugged you miss 100 percent of the time, if you try to play defense the other team walks through you, if you let the ai play defense, they sit around like idle minded fucktards as the other player walks right past them. Game is almost unplayable, not even worth the 9 dollars, I feel like I've been fucking scammed.
Fuck you 2k, you shit company, you're scum on this earth."
6859,"Outside of the visuals, 2k20 is hardly an improvement to the previous games in the franchise. Passing is still not great, AI animations still cause teleporting of the basketball and players slide on the floor to get into position for blocks rather than actually moving their feet. Player movement is clunky and feels slow almost like you're playing flatfooted the entire time. Cannot recommend this game for full price, its only worth it if its on sale for lower than $20."
6860,"Bad controls. Really bad tutorial. Music that makes your ears bleed. Some unskippable developer(?) talk before you even start your career, which you can only start after giving them your e-mail address.

I'm not even going to try to write a fair review for this horrible game, not even worth it for free."
6861,"yes
"
6862,lloijk
6863,"games completely broken, its on sale because nobody plays it, online doesnt work. i requested a refund for me and my friend (i gifted him the game) and its broken for both of us.
Takes 2 hours just to get into the first online part of the game.
Definitely do not recommend on pc."
6864,lebron is the goat
6865,"Poorly Optimised
Loads of Bugs (Invisible Players)
"
6866,for 85% off its a good game but other than that i would not recommend... Legend Edition is worth it as well but if its not 85% off forget it lol
6867,Worth exactly the $9 i paid for it. Game is trash. Awful AI. Never pay full price for 2K
6868,do not buy this game if your going to play on keyboard its fucking impossible
6869,"Impossible. It's like actually being me instead of someone who I assume would have played basketball quite a bit to make it to the NBA.  It's the worst pay to win bs I've ever come across. What could be a great game, ruined by greed. Shame on 2K."
6870,super like
6871,"I bought this game to play MyTeam after playing the previous few games. MyTeam itself is generally fun but online games are terrible with lag and connection errors occurring every 20 seconds or so (I have perfectly working internet for everything else). Also, I only played for a few hours but the game randomly crashed when starting or ending a game or just randomly inbetween, which is incredibly annoying because it won't give you your rewards for winning but still subtract contracts off of your players."
6872,it has nice graphics smoother gameplay ..would be recommending this to a gamer who loves basketball
6873,game is sick
6874,"It has a hell of a lot of problems, but if you're looking for a decent basketball game, it's pretty much your only option. Could be worse, I guess"
6875,GREAT
6876,"If you already have one of NBA 2K games (2k10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19) you don't need to buy this rubbish."
6877,"What a f*** waste, game crashes randomly FFS"
6878,fozs
6879,I love this game. This is like ''look at curry man''
6880,"I got this game on special at almost 90% off. I also only play MyCareer.

Story telling is the same as always. Some heartfelt bullshit where you're a 'pro' rookie, but stayed behind in collage for reasons.

Compared to the last 3 games, earning VC seems to be a lot easier, IF you manage to make it into the first round of drafts. I get 750 per game, excluding the grade/stats of the game. Other than that, the game looks pretty. Controls are the same. Mini games are the same. 

They got rid of the walking out on to the court animation from a previous title (2018 or 2019? Can't remember). So its mostly just Menus, Team Practice Court, Game Court and the neighbourhood if you want.

Cutscenes are skippable except for when the game is loading (duh). 
Don't pay full price, get it only 60% or more special."
6881,love it
6882,k
6883,i love this game
6884,"For me offline mode is a beast, but for the online game i think 2k dev.. need more hardwork to fix the delay while in-game."
6885,"great game with amazing graphics and gameplay that make you love basketball 
"
6886,wtf
6887,ass
6888,"Best Basket game on the market
"
6889,"Picked this up on sale for ~$9 and still feel ripped off.
This franchise was so great and now it's just trash.
I'm absolutely embarrassed for everyone who works at 2K.
"
6890,wait until they add anti cheat to buy any 2k on pc. unless it become's free to play.
6891,Awesome and no need to have extra high speed connection. But you should have a basic knowledge about 2K and I think never skip the storyline would be the best to enjoy the career.
6892,"As someone who hasn't really played a current sports game besides Madden, I think this game is great. Probably not worth buying annually, though. No real complaints overall."
6893,"nigga
"
6894,"Got it in the bundle, not bad"
6895,"I just want to play MC offline ,but it ask for an update.
Fine ,so update it .
But why is the update progress always 0% ?
Is this game a fucking Fraud?"
6896,Nah never again I gave 2k too many chances my career is worse that ever trash ass game. Dont buy even for $8
6897,POG
6898,"NBA 2K20 is that game your friends like to play that is so hollow it makes you dread hitting the purchase button. This game is hollowly trying to get you to spend money, predictable gameplay, predictable metas such as hop stepping. This game pays YouTubers to make content to do pack opening videos to convince you to be homeless, spend money on MyTEAM packs. And every year you tell your friends ""This next 2k better be better"", when it won't. It will be an endless, lonely, dreadful cycle until NBA Live makes a comeback."
6899,"its a good game for pc if u have a controller, servers are laggy but career is fine"
6900,Myplayer mode is broken. Game freezes constantly. Cant even sim until appearance on 144hz. Same broken 2k animations. Same 2k VC problems. Would not recommend even if you get the game free from somewhere atleast for myplayer mode. Maybe the other modes are good. Didnt try em.
6901,This game is trash.
6902,I be hittin 3's cuh
6903,"My career is unplayable for me. Crashes everytime i try play a game. Tried making a new character, skipping a few games nothing works. Complete bs that a company as big as 2K can release such broken crap."
6904,shit game. dont buy it even you saw 99.99% discount
6905,"I love to hate this game, I love the mechanics of creating a player and playing mycareer, but I hate the difficult grind of progress to get to a decent player. I hate the concept of 2k games being a pay wall for everything including progressing your player by leveling up the stats of your mycareer player. The fact that You HAVE to be connected to 2ks server to play the story mode of mycareer is absurd. I honestly would persuade you from spending any money to level up your player but its so hard to resist when you get dominated by the cpu on higher difficulties which rewards you only with a 1.6 x VC at Hall of Fame difficulty. Playground also gets challenging when the game highly incentivizes you to spend money to upgrade your player to compete."
6906,cum
6907,good game getting gooder
6908,shit
6909,"🔹Positive Aspects:
Impressive visuals and face scans.
Huge variety in modes.
Soundtrack.
Best gameplay as far as basketball games go.

🔸Negative Aspects:
Servers.
Major gameplay inconsistencies.
MyCareer is basically a grind game.


▶️Introduction
NBA 2K20 is the latest addition to the NBA 2K lineup which exists for almost 2 decades now. The 2K game series featuring best in class graphics & gameplay, ground breaking game modes, and unparalleled player control and customization. NBA 2K20 was developed by Visual Concepts and published by 2K.

Release Date : 5th September 2019.
Last known update: 29th May 2020.


🎮Gameplay:

Is this game really the most realistic basketball game?

Playing basketball and the basics of 2K:
Well long story short, this is easily the best game as far as gameplay goes, when playing the game you can easily think that this is a legit real life scenario. Shooting mechanics are basically what you expect, everytime you take a jumpshot a shooting bar appears next to your player and if you manage to cover 100% of the bar you get an excellent release which means your shot will hit, unless you get blocked or 2K decides to make you suffer. Obviously you have a huge variety of dribbling moves that are basically real life moves the game even offers streetball moves, in order to successfully perform some of these moves you will need to memorize the patterns for the right analog stick, after that you can break some ankles. Defense has been decently talked about as it got nerfed badly compared to the solid defense we got in NBA2K19, defense feels basically a lot slower and not as body to body aggressive. Don’t be surprised if you see people spamming the steal button as this is probably the most logical defensive tactic in 2K at this exact moment. Lastly passing is something that hasn’t really changed since 2K16 or 2K17, long distance passing is literally a meme as you will never hit your teammate, alley oops are still OP after they got nerfed in 2k14, to use them as many times as possible especially if you got athletic players on your team. Overall the basic essence of the game is more than solid but the unfair advantage of offense is a little bit to harsh.

Gamemodes:
Play Now: In quick play you can match up against today NBA teams as well as some historical teams dating back in the 1960s as well as some All-time teams that feature the best players in the history of each team. Some smaller modes within that mode include Play WNBA that allows you to play with the female NBA teams, NBA Today that allows you to play with today's NBA teams with all the updated ratings, matchups and injuries,Play Now Online is a ranking mode that matches you up against other players worldwide and after each win you collect points in order to improve your ranking lastly Blacktop which was one of my favourite modes back in the day is a nice mode that can go from 1 vs 1 to 5 vs 5 in a street ball setting that allows players to do crazy moves and dunks but fouls as many times as they want to.
My Team: Is a card and rank based mode that needs a lot of grinding, the rankings of each card can go from Bronze to Pink Diamond Opal and some special edition cards are included,you can do challenges, online matches, offline matches and many more activities sadly they removed one great feature which was The Gauntlet that allowed you to take 3 players and start a Blacktop type match, still disappointed that it got removed.
My Career: Is the story based Single and Multiplayer Hybrid aspect, this year is kinda special as 2K added some well known figures to play in the story like Idris Elba as the coach and LeBron James as...well as Lebron James. You start off as a young player with major leader potential basically a guy that cares about his team and winning instead of stats and personal awards, after your good friend and teammate gets a season / Career ending injury you decide to show your frustration by not playing and having a small feud with your coach, as always everything works out and you get drafted and meet Lebron in his personal plane and decides to give a cringey dialogue that made me rip my ears off my head. Other than the ripping ears off my head I enjoyed the Single Player campaign, after that you get put into the Online mode and you’re greeted with the same things as 2k19 , Neighborhood, Parks, Sweaty MyPark guys and Connection Issues.
My League: Is basically Manager mode, where you can select a team and make them win championships, make trades, break the bank and sign a superstar and have jerseys retired and all that good stuff. My GM Is an identical mode just a lot more hardcore with more things to do.

🌇Graphics / Audio:
Honestly, NBA 2K games have probably the best face scans since NBA 2K14, you will be amazed by the visuals.

Audio / Soundtrack:
The soundtrack is great as always, like its really good, voice acting is spot on simply because the same commentators in real life talk in the game as well.

🌀Performance:

In Game:
AMD Ryzen 5 3600 X, 16GB RAM, RTX 2070 S:
I was running the game on Ultra Settings 1080p with 60fps. Note:60fps is the cap

Intel Core i5 5200U, 8GB RAM, Intel HD 5500:
Believe it or not I was running the game on Low Settings 720p with 28 -30 fps.

🖥️Bugs / Glitches / Crashes:
The game was terrible at launch after 6 months it got fixed but I still get to see some minor bugs like at halftime where they display the stats you get the bug that shows that you got as many assists as points, some random crashes happen as well but nothing major. In around 200 hours of being a mediocre 2k Player I had no game breaking issues.

💲Price:
For 50 Euros you get a decent game but I would wait for sales.

⚖️Conclusion:
NBA 2K20 had a terrible launch but after months it is a pleasant experience now with a ton of content and stuff to do, it is a decent sports game.

📉Overall rating: 74/ 100

"
6917,its that hot shit
6918,good game
6919,Its good since there is sale for such a cheap price
6920,"GOOD GAME
"
6921,"Game is a fun distraction for real casual player. AI can feel like it just.. avalanches a game, but I'm still figuring shit out. Totally worth the buy on sale, would never spend 60 on this."
6922,I would recommend this game. It does tho have a few problems like no skilbased servers and the game also crashes a lot. But 25 hours in 2 days i think it's a good gave to play with friends. It's also very hard to get good and it is very time consuming.
6923,is fun and all but My nba Mycareer the player i put vc on is gone for no reason  so i refund it if you want to buy this game is on your risk
6924,"First the game doesn't recognize a PS4 controller.  I literally have free games in my library that do this.  But this has been a feature of 2k as long as I can remember.  So get Steam set up and finally get my controller working only to find that my controller buttons don't match the default Xbox buttons in game, so another feature from 2k.

Finally I get the game working and it asks me to accept the online policy which I refuse because I only play single player ""My League"" and ""My Career"".  Unfortunately this leads to another issue, because 2k has made single player offline impossible.  In order to play single player ""My Career"" you must be online 24-7.  Why?  Greed.  2K wants milk every possible dime out of their players for their $60 AAA game, and they couldn't allow someone to play single player offline, because they cant monetize it.  This is where the pirated version would actually be better than the original game.

So finally I accept the TOS for online play (at this point almost 45 minutes in and still I haven't played, because I like to read what I accept) and the game starts.  I am able to play ""My Career"".

What follows is a travesty.  240p real images and potato quality real video are interspersed between ultra high realistic 2k resolution graphics.   The result is bizarre.  But hey at least they added the ability to skip the majority of cut scenes.   So, so many cut scenes.  I start out listening to the story and realize is just the usual trope, so I begin to skip through the cut scenes.  At one point Thomas Middleditch is on the screen, so I watch that part to see if he's funny.  He says ""Man, I am sweating like a fat kid in a candy shop"".  That seems insensitive to children with obesity, but also on par with 2k.

So I start skipping again, play some college games, combine, everything is going okay.  Finally I get to the point where I am drafted to a NBA team and can actually start the ""My Career"" portion of ""My Career"".  Only I can't.  I set on the bench and it says press A to sim to next time I am put in the game.  But that doesn't work.  I press X (A) and the message goes away and I am stuck watching the team play from the sidelines for the entirety of the game.  And as an added side bonus, they are now moving at 1/8th the speed, so a 6 minute quarter lasts about 48 minutes, entire game will 192 minutes of me just waiting on the bench to be subbed in.

I read up online and find that you can alt tab to fix this problem.  So I do that and it works one time.  After that it either doesn't work at all or the game freezes up and crashes.  At one point it somehow crashed so hard it broke my multiple monitor set up.  After several hard reboots, hours of watching from the sideline, I finally just give up.  Literally the worst gaming experience for 2k to date, and the bar was already very low.

The real kicker?  Because I was in game unable to play, reading the TOS, and skipping through 100s of cutscenes just to get to the point where the game was playable:  I can no longer get a refund, so now I'm stuck with this POS that I can't even play the one mode that I bought the game for.  At $9 it's still a complete and utter rip off.  

Obviously if you don't play career mode this may not affect you, I haven't tried any other modes because I could care less about them.

EDIT: So apparently this is a known bug since the release of the game.  There is a work around that requires you to downgrade your graphic performance to 60Hz, but to date there doesn't appear to be any fix for this bug.   So if you are playing this game on PC with 144Hz, it simply won't work.

Update: Found more bugs, sometimes L Bumper brings up play calling, sometimes it brings up icons.  Sometimes you can press pass and it passes the ball, occasionally you just stand there holding the ball and nothing happens.  There is a lot of downtime in the game where you are just waiting until the game let's you skip ahead to the part where you can actually play the game.  In my career your player is super gimped.  I choose the speed over every other aspect for my physical, unfortunately after playing 15 hours and getting 10k free VC from 2k, my speed is at 76 out of a possible 87 - which means 90% of the people I pair up with just blow by me.   Even if you do great in the game, the difference between doing medicroe and excellent is just a few 100 VC, which won't buy much.  2KTV used to be an option that you could turn off, apparently not any more.  Turning off camera shake doesn't actually turn off camera shake.  

Update: Apparently you are stuck with the nickname CHE?  even after changing your nickname they still refer to you as CHE wtf is that?  Yet another bug in an endless sea of bugs for this barely worth $9 game.  After putting in 30 hours, I still am haven't come close to my maximum physical abilities, meaning that after 500-1000 hours I might actually peak and be an above average player - or you know, you could just spend a few $100 and pay to win.  In addition you are constantly bombarded with Gatorade, Beats,etc. in game advertisements.  At one point they asked me if I would allow them to email an ad in real life for a real life gatorade product.  If this is sponsored by all these corporations in game, why am I paying for the game.  Beats headphones are literally the worst headphones on the market.  I worked as a tech at a computer store and every other week some parent came in with these cheap Chinese headphones asking if we could repair them.  Nope, they are literally crap.  Beats headphones are total junk for any audiophile worth 2 cents, but here in game I have to listen to countless ads about how great the Beats headphones are.. They are junk. worthless crap.  It's insulting to have to listen to in game advertisements for something that is utterly junk, but that pretty much sums up the entire 2k basketball experience at this point...

If someone was to make a basketball game tomorrow with just basketball, no 2ktv, no stories, no pay to win tactics - I would be all in."
6925,"After a couple of mediocre games, played the game of my life and with less than a minute on the clock, they put up connection problem and reset back to start of game. Hell no.  In a word shite, avoid like the plague."
6926,"God awful game. I'm not even getting into the ""pay to win"" aspect, but it's completely unplayable in the perspective of needing ""contracts"" to play your players and where do you get the contracts? - of course, from the packs which are really hard to come by, that is if you're not willing to pay for them in real money. I mean I paid for the game already and what EA is doing is historicaly bad. But that's not all, all the basketball and NBA fans, how long have you waited for at least decent basketball game? 20 years? At least it seems that it has been that long for how long this game has stayed absolutely the same. The in-game matches are just a chore to work through - players movement is awful, no god damn logic in shooting, passing or defending. This game is complete money grab and nothing else. All the ""free stuff"" is not worth the price. The game has been made by people who are obviously no fans of NBA nor basketball. The whole 2k series goes to history as the worst franchise ever!"
6927,Everyone basketball lovers shud play this game im damn sure u will love this game.
6928,gud
6929,Love it
6930,W
6931,Good game :)
6932,Waste of Money
6933,BUY 21
6934,"So much hatred around this basketball game, but I can understand their pain though. Thankfully, I don't really care about MyCareer nor MyTeam mode. All I care about is the MyLeague mode. I can only laugh about the casino games because they are so absurd and ridiculous. This kind of thing just does not belong in a serious sports simulation and always distracts me from the actual game, because I want to play basketball in NBA 2K and not spin lucky wheels. Without casino and VC, NBA 2K would be a far better game. So I get that it makes a few missteps in several modes and the gameplay is also pretty much the same as before, but it’s still a reigning champion in its genre as EA going hiatus with Live. Until next year's 2K21 vs Live 21, maybe? Since EA is bringing most of its games to Steam. Hopefully."
6935,great fun game for league play but the my career is a cess pool of bugs and just bad basketball. It is basically made to make people buy coins to even be a avg player. I wouldnt recommend this game unless u get it on sale. I know after this game I wont ever buy another 2k game they are just con artist trying to bleed people of there money for a bad product.
6936,"Horrible MyTeam and MyCareer, the game is a massive grind to level up, unless you drain your wallets of course. the only things I like about this game is MyLeague and Play Now 7/10"
6937,"Microtransactions aside, this game is pretty good."
6938,"modders galore but funny af

good game"
6939,This is probably the lowest quality game i've played in my entire life. If I was to compare this game to something it would be a  bad p2w mobile game. If you want a good basketball game for PC download Freestyle 2 Street Basketball it has its problems aswell and it's a tad bit P2W (U can play 100% F2P) but it is 100x better the only thing you're missing out on is there's no NBA players.
6940,Nothing more than a money grab. Got it in a Humble Bundle and still feel ripped off
6941,dasdasdasda
6942,
6943,perfect，excellent，wonderful，stupid game and production team
6944,"Bought the game for full price one day before the sale.
Someone dunk on me please."
6945,"NBA 2K20 pretty much the same as the past 4 instalments of NBA 2K games.
Every year the graphics and controls seem to get better and the player accuracy, courts and jerseys always look top notch and as a fan of NBA it's a must for me to keep up with the NBA games.
If online play matters to you you're probably going to have a mixed time, I found playing on the PS4 and having a squad to play rec with and a buddy to collect the MyTeam cards with was somewhat fun. But if there's any exploits or bulls**t trick to take advantage of believe me you will see it and you will see it a lot! Unavoidable when playing online unfortunately.. futhermore the servers are pants! 


However as I am mostly a single player gamer, MyLeague and MyCareer game modes are ideal for me and I enjoy them a lot, MyLeague is great for rebuilding teams or taking your favourite teams to the playoffs and beyond!

Overall I'd recommend purchasing on sale"
6946,"The only reason people buy this game is because they like basketball. Not especially the game itself. Not even worth the 15 or so dollars which is low due to constant sales. An unbalanced, frustrating game."
6947,luka is trash
6948,HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I HATE U MY COCK IS TINY
6949,Very fun
6950,Excelent
6951,miss the nba season  (covid-19) atleast we can play this game! :)
6952,GOOD GAME
6953,This game is only for savages.
6954,thanks for the summer sale .. i finally was able to buy this game
6955,"Game doesn't fucking work, I played over 3 hours and didn't get any achievements. The sim till you start playing in MyCareer doesn't work so you just sit there beating your dick for 15 minutes to play for 3 minutes. You barely get VC, so you have to buy it to compete at a high level. You can't fucking this without having a micropenis and giving up ur asshole to the microtransaction gods. Fuck 2K, Fuck Riot, Fuck Gaben, Fuck Valorant, Fuck EA, Fuck any company especially EFT for putting Microtransactions in their games, and Butt fucking the entire gaming community. I will be the saving grace."
6956,ball go swoosh
6957,"Very good betta
"
6958,"gas
"
6959,"If you've played previous versions of this game, then you will like this one. They've improved MyPlayer, which is pretty much all I play."
6960,"Buy it only if you get it dirt cheap like i did,core gameplay is worth it at that price"
6961,Not Bad
6962,it sucks
6963,"The game is insanely fun.  I mostly play MyCareer which is great if you want to immerse ""yourself"" into your favorite NBA team.  Especially given the lack of real games because of COVID.

MyTeams is great to play with any of the NBA players from the current rosters and from earlier years.  Old school players that have long since retired.  They even let you try and recreate their many great games.  You'll definitely invest a lot of hours into the gameplay for sure."
6964,Terrible progression system. Game is bloated with P2W mechanics and it is annoying AF!
6965,Hackers Online but other than that its a 2k game and it isnt horrible. Just wish the shooting mechanics were better. Its something u learn to adjust too though.
6966,VERY GOOD GAME I RECOMEND
6967,"ver ynice
"
6968,it's horrible
6969,Meh same shit as always
6970,NICE GAME !
6971,"this game is fucking scripted...its miserable you cant enjoy playing this game ,and when you realise its 50 to the garbage...the only way you can get good cards is by paying large, and I mean LARGEEEE amounts of money.  DO NOT BUY"
6972,It's trash. Don't buy it.
6973,ball is life as they say
6974,Best nba 2k game.
6975,"I've bought every 2k from 2k11 to 2k17. I've only bought this one because it was 11,99$. What can you expect from 2k20? About twice as much micro transactions as in 2k19, and about twice as less as in 2k21. You feel like they try to suck you off of your money every single second, and they force you to watch ads, on top of charging you 80$ for a roster update. Early grind in my career seems bearable, but I bet the natural progression is ""soft locked"" to force you into buying VC to keep progressing at a decent rate. Plus, forcing us to choose between character progress and cosmetics (which are basically free advertising) is dubious.

Don't buy this shit full price."
6976,good
6977,its pretty goo i only play career mode and that takes a while between seasons but is pretty fun
6978,I remember my late grandpa playing basketball with me. Such a wonderful game. Makes me cry every time I start the game.
6979,Really fun on pc mostly messing around with mods :)
6980,"FK, LOL...   We can all see why NBA 2K20 has dropped sooooo  LOWwwww.w...        Its always interesting, how you manufactures act as if games are disposable.   Alot of us barely could afford to get the new 2K20 Game.  Let alone build a $1000+ dollar computer system good enough to play the game.   

I feel if anything should happen from 2K Games.  They should honor the customer base, and provide anyone who owns a copy of the game : Digital OR Physical = A free copy of the 2K21 version that doesn't rely solely on Online Server updates in order to play. You guys really screwed the Pouch.... I personally own; NBA 2K16, 2K17, 2K18, 2K20...   I know I skipped a series because it was just a replication of the past 2K18, Roster Changes, and a few others wasn't enough. 

This game is not even worth $8.99 anymore.      MARK MY WORDS   "" YOU WILL END UP WITH ENDLESS DROPS "". Even more Frustrating then that, It will happen frequently throughout game play, a lot of times during the game play. You will lose contracts, you will lose points, you will lose tokens.    This game and its overall integrity are flawed and worthless."
6981,"One of the worst gaming experiences I've recently come across. Spent 80 minutes waiting on the ""Downloading Updates"" window in game. After 80 minutes, it was at 5%. Without that, can't play online at all. Watched my friend's stream who could successfully get into MyPark, and got three disconnects from the server in a matter of 30 minutes. Absolute jokes. What the actual FUCK"
6982,Had to finesse dudes to play. 0/10
6983,i was ballin like trey i hope he will win his basketball game tomorrow
6984,"this game is fun 
"
6985,"Great Game!! full of features most people wont appreciate , MYGM is my favorite mode its just so in-depth"
6986,"got it on sale to play with my friend, cos we used to play 2k12 back in the day.

the game is the same exact jank that 2k12 had, but with higher rez textures and sweat. the fundamental game engine hasn't changed in at least 9 years, and it shows. still teleporting animations, still impossible collision, still shit netcode. they keep changing the UI, which seems to only get worse, constantly hangs or displays wrong information. the substitution menu that you can bring up during gameplay is laggy, unresponsive, confusing, and will sometimes just not work. no you're not doing anything wrong, it's the dog shit UI.

it's still FUN... in extremely specific circumstances; private lobby with friends. otherwise it's a waste of a license and your time. just copy+pasting the same game engine for 60$ every year is embarassing. so much of the budget is dumped on espn cameos no one watches, 2ktv no one watches, the storyline everyone skips through....."
6987,"This game is trash, but i miss basketball so its alright"
6988,i am cursed to play this game for god hates his child
6989,"loved this game... But... It pays to win and I don't like that. You need to grind so much to have fun. And there are a lot of hackers.
Singleplayer is fun. If you buy only for a career or just to play with your friends, I think it is worth it, but if you want to play park (the main thing in this game) be ready to pay."
6990,"All of the things that were wrong with 2013 are still wrong with this game 7 years later.

Its still all animations with funky player moving in ice. etc etc etc.

To make things worse, my player mode is completely ruined. Who the heck wants to do combine BS. Is this a basketball game or not? Commercials, pay to win, all of that nonsense in a game they are trying to charge full price for.

All that has changed since 2013 is the commercials during loading, the micro transactions, and the UI. Behind it, everything else is the same. 

AI is absolutely atrocious. If I were an NBA player, I would sue for defamation of character. Team mates almost never play defense, never stop the ball on a fast break, and all around painful experience.

Going to a dentist is less painful than this game.

The game doesnt know what it is. Is it a basketball game, a visual novel, or Street Fighter 2?

Lakers vs Celtics is still a better game. When did that come out? It was far more fun than this tripe.

You only need to use three buttons - contr+Alt+del

UPDATE:

The more I thought about it I realized what they are doing. The goal was to gut any usefullness of making a single player game to in fact create a online PVP game. They wanted  to make the controls as convoluted as possible in order to encourage micro transactions so hard core PVPers could pay to win.

The gatorade weekly stat buffs are straight out of the 1980s. Hit buttons as fast as you can and ruin your controller. It is completely pointless. Fitting for NES not the 21st Century.

Another Update:
Problems with this game
     Sliders have minimal impact on changing game experience. The CPU in single players appears to ignore them.
     Game is lagy and inconsistent, things like the shot meter skips and jumps controller response time with wired is significantly delayed, no change since 2k13.
     Mouse and keyboard support and key binding is just console port garbage. Not even worth a $10 value.
     Rookie players who should be the fastest and most athletic in their career suffer super slow down until the character is ""leveled"" up. Very unrealistic. This is clearly demonstrated if you compare player movement in the tutorial part of the game to the regular games once in the NBA.
     The design is to try and frustrate impatient players in spending more money that the initial cost on in game currency. An exploitative system by intent.
     Game is programmed to keep games close by making the players you do not control in MyCareer to do nonsense things such as run out of bounds with the ball, players with very low shooting throwing up long distance 3's and the like. In one case a rebounded ball moved in mid air, made a change of direction from a team player to the other team.
      Sliders and badges lack accurate descriptions for how they impact the game - if at all.
      Being open versus guarded, despite what people say, actually has very little impact on shot success."
6991,"very nice game, i spend zero money and win.
12yo buy many packs and lose, very funny."
6992,"its good
"
6993,"The game is great offline.

I understand people are mad at the MyCareer and the multiplayer. If you just want to sit back, relax, and enjoy basketball, this is it.

If you wanted to play MyCareer but don't want to invest in a player, just play MyLeague and use ""player lock"". Create your character, customize however you like and enjoy.

Online play is non-existent. Don't even bother.

The increased difficulty in MyLeague make me want to come back to the game mode every single time I play. 2K have nerfed some parts of the stat system like a players potential. Someone who's A+ in potential may only shine if he has players who revolve around his play-style. Although, I find that you need a star in order to win a championship. Mediocre 80 overalls won't get you anywhere but the second round.

Virtual currency is very lenient this game. You can get an easy 1500 each game. They implemented a progression feature with the MyCareer character that allows you to progress through basketball. The progression blocks the player from increasing overalls. But, it allows the character to develop in a realistic fashion, although, very grindy. That's why I mentioned the MyLeague option.

If you enjoy basketball and offline play, it's something to look forward to when it's on sale. Looking for multiplayer? Stay clear from this title.

**Disclaimer: This is a straight copy of my review of 2K19. Nothing has changed.**"
6994,bra spel

6999,game bad
7000,"Here is my honest assessment of the 2K series and this game. I read most of the bad reviews and I read most of the good reviews prior to buying this game. I have not owned or played NBA 2K since 2K16. So I decided to buy this game when it was on sale. I can honestly say that I will never buy another NBA 2K game ever again without some serious changes. This game at its core has not changed much since 2K16. This port for PC is really awful. If you're trying to play online then you are just wasting your time, between the input lag, the net code, and the 2K servers, the online play is dreadful. One of the biggest reason why I quit playing NBA 2K was because the servers were not good. They have not been good the past few years and this year was the worst I have experienced by far. I have watched countless hours of YouTuber's who play this game and it looks bad for them too, I will say that online play seems to run a little smoother on PS4 and Xbox but I am only saying that cause of the  YouTube videos I have seen. I don't know why the online connections on PC are so bad but it is unplayable. Outside of the 2K servers, the other reason I will never buy another NBA 2K game again unless changes are made, is because of all the microtransactions. All 2K cares about is money. Everything you do in this game involves money. I personally have only played MyTeam mode. I read to many horror stories about the other online game modes, so I stuck with MyTeam only. 

This mode could be a lot better. If you are a player that chooses not to pay money, then you are in for one long grind. The sad part about the grind is, outside of the GOAT Galaxy Opal Kobe card, the rewards you get are not really worth grinding for. As mentioned previously, I can never connect to matches and if I do, it is a lag fest the whole time. You will also notice as a non-paying player that you will be at an extreme disadvantage against paying players. No matter your skill level, if someone has a stacked team, 9 times out of 10 they will beat you, and there is not a whole lot that can be done about it, and it is all because they bought it and it is another ploy from 2K to try and get you to spend money. I will admit that I have a good paying job, so it sadly affords me the opportunity to indulge myself on needless expenses, such as buying VC for packs. Be that as it may, getting such a late start to MyTeam, kind of forces you to pay if I want to get good players in a limited time. To those that wonder if paying money for VC to buy packs is worth it, I will tell you it is not. That is another reason why I feel cheated with this NBA 2K game. Even when you decide to spend money on the game, the pack odds are terrible. The chances of pulling the same duplicate cards seems to be a lot higher than need to be and at the end of the day, if you do pull a Galaxy Opal, chances are it is going to be the worst one. The amount of money that I have spent in the little I have played this game is not worth the rewards that you get. The offline modes would be better, but as I have seen in several reviews, the input lag on PC is bad. The players go out of their way to do the weirdest moves on the simplest of commands. Unless I am wide open and not moving, almost every shot has a delay, and it is multiplied by a 1000 when playing online. 

If you read this far, then you've probable guessed that I am just writing this review because I am annoyed at spending money and not getting the best players. That may have been very annoying for me, I just wanted to tell you the truth from someone who isn't paid to write nice things about this game, my assessment is true. I am not a YouTuber, and I am not a Streamer, I am just that regular everyday person who really wanted this game to be good, and  it just isn't which is sad. I promise I don't regret spending the money on the packs, my annoyance with that is that the pack odds seems to favor 2K and again- their idea of making money off people. Plain and simple please stop buying 2K games and spending your money on this company. At the end of the day this company cares about one thing, and that is themselves. They make billions of dollars from players every year, and every year this game does not improve, mainly their servers, what could be the best aspect of this game, playing online with your buddy from across the country, turns into an unplayable lag fest. Never invest your time or money into a company that is littered with microtransactions and allows people to be pay to win. I just wish NBA Live would return and be somewhat decent, that may give 2K a reason to go back and do better and realize what use to make this game fun in the first place. Do Not Buy."
7001,Even the menu's are frustrating.
7002,Was fun now completely overrun by hackers and EA doesn't give shit
7003,good game
7004,perfect
7005,so many hackers
7006,"thought 2k19 sucked. got this in a bundle. thought ""hey maybe it has become a better game.""

it didnt."
7007,this game is ass
7008,WONT LAUNCH
7009,Fuck 2K.
7010,GOOD
7011,doesnt let me move in online games for some reason!!!! need help fixing this issue. started a couple of weeks ago and cant figure out how to fix it.
7012,"Great game, would definitely recommend. I play Myleague so my view point is from that and not Myplayer and the lack of attention to park. But, from what I look for in this game I am happy."
7013,"When it comes to NBA 2K you know what you are going to get from a game play standpoint. The game play will always be crisp and refined and represents the NBA game faithfully. The level of detail they put into the game modes is also phenomenal. 

The thing that I hate that NBA 2K has become is a walking billboard advertisement for other products. You can't escape it...and they down right will play a commercial for you while going into a game sometimes. VC (virtual currency) is a concept I wish they would do away with, but it makes them extra money and it is here to stay.

Bottom Line:
- If you are looking for a game where the core game play is fundamentally sound with extreme levels of detail in many game modes then 2K20 is for you. Just be prepared to try and be sold something while you play."
7014,"I have a lot of fun with nba2k, but I only play local against CPU and friends. I may go online to play an exhibition with the default teams. I don't play any game modes that involved those filthy predatory microtransaction! STOP supporting them by buying VC. My player isn't even good anymore."
7015,Terrible game. The MyCareer is just ruined imo and honestly the last good one was 2k11/2k12.
7016,Broken game. Terrible graphics and way too much lag.
7017,not fun if you dont have a controller hooked up
7018,"Horrible game, ran by hackers who think they are good at the game, Its ridiculous 2k doesn't do anything about it.
The game is in a unplayable state even people cheat on my team. Solo career is the only thing your safe from hackers.
The game should have never came out on pc if they didn't intend to support the community. 500 hours in and finally can say 
2k is way worse than NBA Live. at least on the pc side of things."
7019,"Skroo this game. The gameplay, visuals and content are off the charts, it had the potential to be so good, BUT...

1. So buggy on PC.  And they won't fix it.  They said they would, they didn't.  It crashes ALL THE TIME, and it breaks your heart to lose the progress.
2. They're still selling this game, yet not supporting it!  If you won't support it, then take it off the market.
3. MyTeam is pay-to-play, but even if you grind it out, they will clamp the breaks on your progress the second that the next year's edition comes out.  So MyTeam now is a shell of what it was.

You had a year to play this game, and it's up.  Even for free, this game might not be worth it - it's so much fun when it works, but then it breaks you in half."
7020,it crashes non stop super poorly optimized dont waste your money like i did
7021,I like
7022,"god tier game
"
7023,"This game has a steep learning curve. There's no in-game tutorial and no help for new players. If you're new to 2k and want to pick up and play, this game is not for you. The in game purchases are additionally really annoying, and the slow progression of career mode is frustrating as you play one every 20 minutes of story line; hardly enough time to get to know your player. Also, the combine sucks."
7024,cuh
7025,bruh
7026,great game
7027,very very !
7028,"I've enjoyed this season, the park and rec for PC players unfortunately is trash due to losers who wanna hack but if you enjoy playing My Career and My Team like I do it's a lot of fun."
7029,good game! <3
7030,"just buy it
"
7031,ahujenas
7032,"This game has gone so far from being made for the enjoyment of gamers. Another classic 2k with extreme pay to win mechanics, no improvements on gameplay from previous years, but still charging the full price. But, there's more sweat, so have to give them one point. 1/10"
7033,"decent game. if you like just playing mycareer for a little bit there are worse things to get in a large bundle.
but i 100% would not recommend it, because there are a ton of ads in the game, and the game constantly tries to get you to spend money on microtransactions to make your player better.
If it wasn't in a bundle that I already wanted to buy multiple other games from (where the proceeds are all going to a good cause) there's no way I would have bought this game. it feels really excessive."
7034,"Training and game situaitons are too different when itcomes to getting a green release. Simple to do in practice, nearly impossible in game
"
7035,its dope i hate how in my career they would change what guy im holding out of no where to a guy thats about to score and id loose team rating because i wasnt holding the guy
7036,"alright rip, no more my career once they shut down the servers :/

not gonna buy another nba 2k game until they make career mode available offline..

yeah its a fun play but i hate how you can't be op af in my career LOL
there's limits to how far you can upgrade your character"
7037,"r.i.p kobe mane he was better than mj
"
7038,Better than expected from the reviews...
7039,"Let me start off by saying I play these games because:
1)  I love the NBA
2) They keep giving me cheap copies / bundled deals 

I almost only play the MyCareer mode exclusively, so I can only imagine how people feel if they play everything. I'd go on a rant about the details in this review but I think I'll save my energy...you can read the other reviews for that. To tell it to you bluntly, if I have to search up bugs that prevent me from playing and spend time trying to find a workaround so I can play again it's not worth it. They should invest in more testing before they release these games."
7040,online play bugs make me want to do a gainer off a 5 story building. not very epic
7041,great game needs fast pc
7042,NICE GAME

"
7044,Why is it so difficult to quit the game? Why the exit button does not respond on mouse click? If such things are on purpose for marketing reasons then I would wish the most painfull and deadly kind of cancer to the capitalist pig who had the idea.

7046,yes

7048,nice

7050,Decent
7051,"How does a player who misses open layups, can't defend, shoot, dribble or rebound get drafted for the NBA....? Supposedly the world's best basketball league?"
7052,I got this game after playing the series for years. I took a break at 2k16 even tho i was decent and actually on a team. The Pay to Win model kills me. 4 hours into the single player career and i have 5k in money to upgrade my player. I went to purchase some attributes with ingame currency and i maxed out stats for shits and gigs to see how much i need to max out my stats. 200k ingame currency. 160 hours for one character isnt bad if you're an Eternal but my fleshy meat bag of a body cant nearly endure the time needed to play more than one character enjoyably
7053,"at first i thought the problem was coming from my pc 
but  no it was the game it self 
fps keeps droping more and more 
refresh rate stuck at 60ghz dont know why tired every thing 
nothing changes keeps lagging and screen freeze

7055,"its alright, better on console but still alright on pc. 6.5/10"
7056,great game
7057,"The input lag on PC is real. It feels like you're constantly playing on an ice Mario level, everything glides in a bad way.

The entire game is basically an advertisement, for either sponsors in the game or to buy Virtual Currency from 2K. During my career I even got to a point where my PC would load the game, and the game would say fully loaded, but I had to sit and wait through a real world car commercial advertisement before I could continue. This is a $60 game, not a free to play game, and this behavior is toxic and bad to the gaming industry and it's players.

Lastly, the pacing of career mode is soooooooooo slow. Nothing nothing nothing clunky drill nothing nothing nothing shoe deal pitches (basically five advertisements), nothing nothing nothing finally a game, and repeat. Then it dumps you into the game portion in which everything is done through the Neighborhood. I joined in to see ten players running around with 20 foot arms, and then a bunch of ways to try to get you to buy Virtual Currency in case you forgot.

Overall I'd give the game a 3/10. Not worth it unless you get it in a bundle or free."
7058,"Same, Same, But [strike] Different [/strike] More of the same.
I got it for just over $1 in a bundle..."
7059,"2K20 is a 2K game. You've played any these past few years, you've had the experience. Roster and UI gets updates, graphics and animations are consistent. MyCareer cutscenes are as annoying as always. Servers are shoddy and bugs are here and there. And above all, MyCareer has the worst grind imaginable to keep you playing this title, sinking your money, and funding the next middling basketball experience. But hey, that's all you need."
7060,ITS FEELS LIKE TAKING SHOT IF MY I GET LAID TODAY OR TONIGHT
7061,Fun game
7062,"yes

7066,3
7067,"This is my first NBA2K game I've played, and i love it. The gameplay is very smooth, and overall just a pleasant experience. Unfortunately there are some slight annoyances, #1 being micro transaction city, and going into this game with no knowledge in playing is difficult/frustrating. Doing a little research will go long ways in terms of a BUILD (MyCareer), but gameplay will take practice. 8/10"
7068,"The gameplay is good, but 2k18 was better. The overall game in my opinion is good but there are too many animation faults and needs some patching to do with the overall game. It is playable but I'm hoping 2K21 is gonna be better and hopefully they have they're glitches patched. The face creation and overall player creation thing is gonna need to be fixed aswell. There are players walking around with almost 2 meter long hands and shooting threes that they are nothing. The 60 overalls/ new players should get some starting VC to upgrade to atleast 65 ovr not start grinding at 60. Sixty is too much of a grind and they should get some starting VC is what I am saying."
7069,"What an awful game - The gameplay is centered around doing everything but actually playing. So many supporting options when all you want to do is just play ball and improve your character attributes.

Also my pc specs are way much better than the recommended settings and there's still lag when playing on low settings. Definitely do not buy this game. I'm lamenting the decision and requesting for a refund.

7070,FUCK THIS GAME! i ran out of of patience for this. is soooo stupid! I GOT NO CHOICE because I LOVE BASKETBALL BUT THIS IS MY ONLY OPTION FFUCK

7074,ye
7075,Amazing game 10/10
7076,"The game ain't that bad if you only want to play offline modes like playnow or blacktop. The thing is that nowadays people usually play 2k because of online modes like myteam or park which i also play but the thing that makes this game not that fun is because of servers that are full of cheaters plus 2k's servers are garbage asf. Another thing is the microtransactions in this game. 2k really wants to rob you cuz if you grind in this game you won't really make a lot of vc. Since 2k21's almost out, I would just wait for that hoping that it'll be as good as the last good 2k game which was 2k16 so if you are planning to buy this, just don't even bother on playing it lmao."
7077,i like basketball so this game is cool in that aspect
7078,"i love how they didnt even change the steam logo from 2k19. they just changed""19"" with ""20"".
It's NBA 2k19 with a new roaster and a new UI. Also there are some mycareer changes but i still didnt like it"
7079,"This is by far one of the worst 2ks for pc, only because of the lag everything else is good."
7080,good game but hackers need to be fixed and contesting system kinda broken
7081,"What's the point in paying for the game, paying even for VC and still being shit until you unlock all the badges? You pay for everything just so you have to grind even more?

The AI gets worse and worse as years go by. Career mode is not playable with this kind of AI."
7082,"Man can we get this VC out of this game?  Why should we pay $60 for a game thats a massive grind unless you decide to pay to win.  Paying to win shouldnt be an option.  Your myplayer shouldnt be a total gimp that cant shoot, dribble or play decent defense.  All you can really do at the beginning is pass and look for assists but I just threw one straight through Lebrons hands so whats the point?  I feel like my team and player struggle to make shots solely because this company wants me to go buy vc.  If it were logical and easier, thered be no need for VC at all.  Theres strategic nonsensical difficulty implemented here by the designers to make the grind unpleasant and drawn out to milk money out of the players.  

Does anyone else feel like their shot indicators are ridiculous as well?  They need to check the definition of VERY because 99% of the time VERY late or early seemed barely late or early at all.  I cant tell you how many times I filled that bar all the way up and was wide open and still got a slightly late or early.  Its honestly unreal how bad this game is.  And I attribute it 100% to them pushing the vc on everyone.  

""Buy our overpriced NBA 2k19 knock off and then buy $99 worth of garbage that isnt going to mean anything in 6 months when the next one comes out! Oh and watch these ads for Kia while the screens load!""  The fact that 2k19 and 2k18 are still $60 should say a lot about this company.  Can we riot against gaming companies next?  Seriously, they need to stop putting pay to win mechanics in full priced games.  Especially ones that COME OUT YEARLY AND ARE THE SAME GAME EVERY YEAR.  The difference between years is so minimal its pathetic!

The story is trash too.  Heres an idea, how about we make our own decisions and build our own story?  Instead of just watching our character play out some inept nonsensical story themselves."
7083,really good
7084,It's fun to play but it would be better if they included the real GOAT. Malik Rose.

7088,"not enough content, got bored after the first 2 hours"
7089,bad
7090,"The game is fun but the graphics  could have been better. Russel Westbrook looks like an alien. Most of the players dont look very real.

7091,The best NBA 2K so far
7092,ITs really fun. U make friends to.
7093,Whack as game
7094,VRH
7095,this game is amazing
7096,"The neighborhood is complete trash. Don't buy this game unless you plan on playing againist hackers running with Lebron, Kobe, MJ, Shaq. You view the 2k card the stats show 60 overall on a majority or players. But they have Legend rep; kicking players off courts that may have 5 game win streaks on.  2k support is trash as they wont address this issue. Myteam has the same problems. 0/10 for releasing a uncontrollable dumpster fire. I've reached out to the 2k  and they dont consider 90% of their game unplayable as a problem."
7097,full of cheaters
7098,i like it.
7099,"INSANE GAME LOVE IT
"
7100,"Almost every 2 games, crashes in random times of the game, but mostly happens in the 3rd and 4th quarter which makes it so frustrating. Tried lowering the graphics and lowering the settings. No customer support, and cant get a refund. The game is good, but just annoying if you are getting into it and the game just decides to crash while your defending a shot or shooting a jump shot. Get this game if its discounted further to £4-5. That is my opinion"
7101,POOGERS
7102,mother fucker everyone make smothered very late shots suck my pp
7103,Very realistic
7104,"I'm from SEA and for online modes, this game is straight up horrible. I have 100mbps Wifi and have never had any latency issues with other games except for this one. Shooting a jumpshot online is almost impossible for me, I have searched for a lot of tips on how to deal with it like looking at your Jumpshot instead of the meter or train my timing with muscle memory they don't work at all, the input lag is also a huge problem online so much that you can't even defend. If you're living in SEA and plan to play online, i recommend you spend your money elsewhere. 2K has been the same since 2k15 and they still haven't done anything about the server issues and latency."
7105,love it but to many hackers
7106,"good game
"
7107,חרא משחק
7108,"as an offline game, this game is a lot of fun with mods and the right difficulty.

if you're looking for a fun, online basketball experience, I wouldn't buy this year.

But as an offline-only player, I recommend it."
7109,"This game sucks.

I only bought it because I like career mode and this years NBA roster is the most competitive it has been in a long time. Like almost 90% of the other reviews this is a legit copy of 2k19. The only difference is the new way to build your characters which granted is cool and works well. Everything else sucks. The AI is one of the worst things I have ever seen in a video game. You can have Anthony Davis who is 97 in my career mode and he goes like 1-10 in the paint against Trae young. That's not even a joke. The AI almost never posts up or do any good moves, if you pass them the ball in the paint they will take the ugliest most contested shot right away with like 15 seconds left on the shot clock. This would be fine if they were like 80 overall but we are talking about the Player that's on the cover of your game. They refuse to add more features and or fix anything. I understand that career mode is not as profitable but this company make an insane amount of cash on this game and as consumers we deserve a better product.

Dont buy this game if already own a 2K game made in the last 5 years. You're wasting your money and you only give them the power to continue to improve nothing about their games. Idiots like myself and other ""loyal"" fans are the reason these games never improve. This is the last 2k game I buy until they actually improve any aspect of gameplay."
7110,Great Game
7111,Game is trash but there isn't any other options if you want to play a realistic NBA game
7112,Really fun game
7113,yes
7114,decent

7123,a great game
7124,"This game stoole mu money dawg
"
7125,This game is dog Awful
7126,The game is fun for like 3 weeks then you realize how dog it is and its the same at last years game so would recomend just waiting for the new 2k to come even though i have a feeling its going to be the same game as this year.
7127,Hello?
7128,Wow this is a bad game
7129,Buggy mess. Have 3 hours logged in. Not one minute played.
7130,"I got this game on sale, and it's my first time ever playing 2k on a platform that has online play.  Last time I played 2k was on the Nintendo Wii.  

Ok so, MyCareer/MyPlayer and MyLeague are fun.  I haven't touched MyTeam, and don't think I will.  I'm not into collecting cards but whatever. 

But when it comes to MyCareer, it's super fun.  I don't get a feeling much when i play the league and it's a bunch of repetition.  I like the progression and it's fun.  I made it all the way through two seasons with one character and will start another one.  Awesome fun stuff. Standard game mode is an A+

When it comes to online play, this is what you can expect:
As with any PC game expect hackers.  Super long arms, OP shooters, I don't even see the best youtubers shoot this well.  They hacking, and if you like to cheat to win then go ahead and do that.  I personally, don't care, if i see it, i just don't join them or play against them.  
There's absolutely no REC games.  So don't try.  you'll be waiting for hours to find one game, which mind you by the time a game is found, the players are AFK and the game get's cancelled.  A suggestion here is to visualize how many are needed in a rec game to get it started while you're in the park and not taking a shot in the dark. Hope that gets seen
But for the most part, 90% of the people play the game straight up.  It's fun.  There's not a lot of people, but that's okay.  There's enough to have each park about 50% capacity and a little higher during peak hours.  Online Play gets a B for me."
7131,please fix game updates download. i cannot play my career because of the said problem. Thank you. Please help on this
7132,mmm
7133,This game sucks af i played 2 times in my career and when i save and quit during game it keep delete my player's file wtf at least i bought it during sale heh give my money back
7134,"I've been playing NBA game's since NBA Live 96 on Window's ro was it MS DOS cannot remember.
Got to say one of the best Career mode's for any Sport's game i have played!! hand's down...
10/10 for that

VC to upgrade myself and make it easyer spending $159 on VC yeah that ruin's it..
I even found looking for shoe's there's a freaken Casino in the game what the acutal 0/10

7138,"🔹Positive Aspects:
Very basic but respectable NBA Basketball Simulation 

🔸Negative Aspects:
Servers 
Major gameplay inconsistencies.
MyTeam is trash
Dev team are a bunch of bums
exploitable gameplay
Patches create more bugs
Any sort of Online play has terrible latency 
Mycareer is a grind without the 'Legend Edition'
No new historic teams 
MyGM hasnt changed since 2K16
Poor Performance 
The community is beyond Cancer 
Literally the same game as 2k17, yet ill spend hundreds of hours playing this piece of shit game ... not because i enjoy the game, but because i'm an NBA fan.

Fuck this game, fuck the dev team and fuck the servers"
7139,this game is crap....
7140,"I only play MyCareer, the story and the court feeling was awesome.

Then their shut down the server."
7141,Look... the game is not bad... at all. Play the story mode... play GM mode... play a WNBA season... it's a great game. Just stay away from the stupid card games and online and it's really damn good.
7142,the game is great i just cant skip when im in career mode.
7143,no
7144,Yes
7145,Great game
7146,2k19 with more bugs.
7147,"fuck you
"
7148,Online is not playable in EU because of latency. I have perfect latency in most of games. But this game is oriented for USA market. Because of this problem there is no point to buy new release every year also. I bought 2k20 because I didn't play previous versions.
7149,top
7150,Cool Game
7151,"The fact that MyCareer is online has undestandable disadvantages, for me as well, but on the other hand it is a very welcome change with a strong feeling of a personal online ID for each player."

7153,"yes
"
7154,"to mant hacers

[h1]▶️Introduction[/h1]
NBA 2K20 is the latest addition to the NBA 2K lineup which exists for almost 2 decades now. The 2K game series featuring best in class graphics & gameplay, ground breaking game modes, and unparalleled player control and customization. NBA 2K20 was developed by Visual Concepts and published by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/2K]2K.[/url]

Release Date : 5th September 2019.
Last known update: 29th May 2020.


[h1]🎮Gameplay:[/h1]

[b]Is this game really the most realistic basketball game?[/b]

[list] [*] [b]Playing basketball and the basics of 2K:[/b]
Well long story short, this is easily the best game as far as gameplay goes, when playing the game you can easily think that this is a legit real life scenario. Shooting mechanics are basically what you expect, everytime you take a jumpshot a shooting bar appears next to your player and if you manage to cover 100% of the bar you get an excellent release which means your shot will hit, unless you get blocked or 2K decides to make you suffer. Obviously you have a huge variety of dribbling moves that are basically real life moves the game even offers streetball moves, in order to successfully perform some of these moves you will need to memorize the patterns for the right analog stick, after that you can break some ankles. Defense has been decently talked about as it got nerfed badly compared to the solid defense we got in NBA2K19, defense feels basically a lot slower and not as body to body aggressive. Don’t be surprised if you see people spamming the steal button as this is probably the most logical defensive tactic in 2K at this exact moment. Lastly passing is something that hasn’t really changed since 2K16 or 2K17, long distance passing is literally a meme as you will never hit your teammate, alley oops are still OP after they got nerfed in 2k14, to use them as many times as possible especially if you got athletic players on your team. Overall the basic essence of the game is more than solid but the unfair advantage of offense is a little bit to harsh.

[*] [b]Gamemodes:[/b]
[i][b]Play Now[/b][/i]: In quick play you can match up against today NBA teams as well as some historical teams dating back in the 1960s as well as some All-time teams that feature the best players in the history of each team. Some smaller modes within that mode include [b]Play WNBA[/b] that allows you to play with the female NBA teams, [b]NBA Today[/b] that allows you to play with today's NBA teams with all the updated ratings, matchups and injuries,[b]Play Now Online[/b] is a ranking mode that matches you up against other players worldwide and after each win you collect points in order to improve your ranking lastly [b]Blacktop[/b] which was one of my favourite modes back in the day is a nice mode that can go from 1 vs 1 to 5 vs 5 in a street ball setting that allows players to do crazy moves and dunks but fouls as many times as they want to.
[i][b]My Team[/b][/i]: Is a card and rank based mode that needs a lot of grinding, the rankings of each card can go from Bronze to Pink Diamond Opal and some special edition cards are included,you can do challenges, online matches, offline matches and many more activities sadly they removed one great feature which was The Gauntlet that allowed you to take 3 players and start a Blacktop type match, still disappointed that it got removed.
[i][b]My Career[/b][/i]: Is the story based Single and Multiplayer Hybrid aspect, this year is kinda special as 2K added some well known figures to play in the story like Idris Elba as the coach and LeBron James as...well as Lebron James. You start off as a young player with major leader potential basically a guy that cares about his team and winning instead of stats and personal awards, after your good friend and teammate gets a season / Career ending injury you decide to show your frustration by not playing and having a small feud with your coach, as always everything works out and you get drafted and meet Lebron in his personal plane and decides to give a cringey dialogue that made me rip my ears off my head. Other than the ripping ears off my head I enjoyed the Single Player campaign, after that you get put into the Online mode and you’re greeted with the same things as 2k19 , Neighborhood, Parks, Sweaty MyPark guys and Connection Issues.
[i][b]My League[/b][/i]: Is basically Manager mode, where you can select a team and make them win championships, make trades, break the bank and sign a superstar and have jerseys retired and all that good stuff. [b]My GM[/b] Is an identical mode just a lot more hardcore with more things to do.

[h1]🌇Graphics / Audio:[/h1]
Honestly, NBA 2K games have probably the best face scans since NBA 2K14, you will be amazed by the visuals.

[*] [b]Audio / Soundtrack:[/b]
The soundtrack is great as always, like its really good, voice acting is spot on simply because the same commentators in real life talk in the game as well.

[h1]🌀Performance:[/h1]
[b][/b]
[*] [b]In Game:[/b]
AMD Ryzen 5 3600 X, 16GB RAM, RTX 2070 S:
I was running the game on Ultra Settings 1080p with 60fps. Note:60fps is the cap

Intel Core i5 5200U, 8GB RAM, Intel HD 5500:
Believe it or not I was running the game on Low Settings 720p with 28 -30 fps.

[*] [b]🖥️Bugs / Glitches / Crashes:[/b]
The game was terrible at launch after 6 months it got fixed but I still get to see some minor bugs like at halftime where they display the stats you get the bug that shows that you got as many assists as points, some random crashes happen as well but nothing major. In around 200 hours of being a mediocre 2k Player I had no game breaking issues.
[/list]

[h1]💲Price:[/h1]
For 50 Euros you get a decent game but I would wait for sales.

[h1]⚖️Conclusion:[/h1]
NBA 2K20 had a terrible launch but after months it is a pleasant experience now with a ton of content and stuff to do, it is a decent sports game.

[h1]📉Overall rating: 74/ 100 [/h1]

7160,its a cool game
7161,Good. Always fav
7162,Ameazing. Lebron OP
7163,"I tried to play dis in my pc and it looked like a game from 2010 dam ronnie needs some milk, hope they  improve the quality, they only add more sweat every new 2k game"
7164,j
7165,m
7166,izya
7167,people who played this game outside Europe you have fucking problem with this stupid game   garbage servers why the  fuck i have delay  I can't shoot single shot without lagging anyone anyone tell me what the wtf this problem is
7168,my wifes boyfriend let me play
7169,Offline is fun but the online mode is filled with hackers.
7170,Is it just me or i cant create a white player ???? i hope this is some kind of a glitch because it would be a shame if he situation in america affects the game .
7171,"Big game! I have never seen cheaters in a park, so i can enjoy the game. nice gameplay, good events, great servers!"
7172,"it coo
"
7173,"Honestly the core gameplay hasn't changed for the last few years. 
Only things that change form year to year are just updated rosters and some added gameplay options that want you to grind or pay money for VC.

Buy when its on sale or you really need updated rosters or really want to play online."
7174,"My time is in the offline My Career mode.  Love the challenge of playing on a horrible team and not focus on power levelling my player, but just keep it real."
7175,"So  NICE
"
7176,nice lol
7177,"Bugged trash that makes you pay real money for VC so your player isn't complete garbage on the court.   Bug that makes it so you cant ""Sim till next appearance"" which mean early in your career you'll have to watch every min of every game from the bench."
7178,"The gameplay is fun. You really need to make sure you are not covered by a defender when taking a shot, otherwise even if you get your timing down it wont go in. There is a lot of pay to win shit going on in this game though."
7179,Very good game
7180,"Get this game on super sale if you can. $20 or less. Still has an amazing MyPlayer and Single Player experience. You don't really need to spend money on this game but it is a grind to get your MyPlayer and MyTeams going. Use booster pack codes and any kind of free give aways to help boost both modes. The game still has great local multiplayer in Play Now modes. Still a terrible online experience but at this point there's no need to worry about the Neighborhood cuz all the hackers have sucked the life out of the most basic of game modes. 

Get this on sale and enjoy some basic but deep basketball sims."
7181,my career glitches even worse tjan 2k19
7182,nice game
7183,penis
7184,"Dude This game is hella fun, and yes hackers everywhere but if you really look at it just have a good time and plus you could hack too. You have no restraints . So go ahead get it but before you do find a cheap version like on www.gamestop.com or something i got it for 10 bucks so its a good deal"
7185,Best Basketball Video Game. Period.
7186,i cannot rec. this game. too many questions. career is horrible. cannot sim time through ai games in career. people online 99 ovr and they have 0 wins. just overall.. not good
7187,yeehaw
7188,w
7189,"First, the game play itself is really good. Graphics are outstanding and puts the console versions to shame honestly. VC is still a thing but doesn't affect my review, as it is the standard and unfortunately is not going anywhere. The problem with the game is that the game CRASHES CONSTANTLY, UNEXPECTEDLY, AND WITHOUT AND ERROR. 2K is no help on the matter either. After doing hours of research apparently 2K and Nvidia have problems working together so I am stuck with a product that constantly crashes. I can go 2 minutes or 2 hours but IT WILL CRASH eventually. Don't buy if you have little patience or NVIDIA. Otherwise great game."
7190,good and consistant
7191,"This game is literally a piece of fucking cunt. The three point shooting is like trying to shoot cum into a two year old bitch. The defending makes you slide around like a fucking condom on skates. They were supposed to respect Kobe by making a beast card with him but the card can't shoot for shit. It's like they basically just said fuck you to Kobe. And don't even get me started on Chris ""Fuck Boy"" Paul. This motherfucker cannot throw a basketball into any hoop. I pray that he can't have kids and if he already has some, I hope Epstien got to them. Fuck off 2k and fuck off everybody else that thinks this game is ""fire"".
My review out of ten if you can't tell is: Fuck off you piece of shit cunt game/10. Thank you and piss off."
7192,sex
7193,really great game overall! i have only played the MyCareer so far and it is so good. The story line truly does make you feel like you really are an NBA star.
7194,Gambling similator
7195,(:
7196,2k ruined another game..first wwe and now nba. well good job
7197,UMM
7198,"this game is full of shit, too many hackers playing on it..waste of money DO NOT BUY ANY NBA 2K games in the future, 2K GAVE ZERO F*** on PC platform cause they knew this kind of shit happen wayback from previous version, they do not attempt to ban or secure the server from this hacker users..I REPEAT DO NOT BUY FUTURE NBA 2K GAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!! IF YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,GO PLAY ON CONSOLE1! PC IS REAL SHITTY PLATFORM FOR NBA 2K ONLINE!"
7199,good  fun games  buy
7200,good

7210,hi
7211,very not gud
7212,"El juego con mas hackers que yo he visto en mi vida. Los servidores mas lentos que las ancianas, los crasheos cada hora. Si no utilizas hacks tu no puedes hacer nada aqui. Tambien que nostoros no tenemos todo el contenido de la play 4. Los helicopteros que te petan el oido cada 2 por 3, por los niños ratas cuales ponen leynda con los hacks. Y todavia puedo decir muchas cosas pero paso. No os recomiendo comprar este juego de mierda, aun que el modo de un solo jugador es bastante guapo."
7213,nice
7214,"Single-player perspective only:
Apart from the glaring $$$ to win. It's actually okay. 
Badges can't be purchased only attributes can be bought with $$$.
Grinding is fine. Used to grind on Dark Souls so not a big deal."
7215,"Had a lot of fun with this so far, even though I find it pretty difficult. Graphics are incredible, even on my old system. Lots of different modes. and things to do.  Career mode is great, and I'm enjoying MyTeam too. I've dabbled a bit in multi-player but my internet is too slow to fully enjoy. What I have seen looks good though."
7216,I like my career in every part of it
7217,Great gameplay for my career
7218,"This game is 100% designed to encourage you to spend more money. It's more frustrating than fun even when you get good and are playing on harder difficulties. and it seems to be getting worse each year...

If you want to achieve your dream of becoming an NBA legend or assembling a Myteam dream team, you better be prepared to waste a lot of your valuable time or spend a lot of your valuable money. 

You could play Mygm but it's just plain boring, so few features have changed or evolved for the last 5 years and the Storyline they try to wedge into it feels slow and more like a boring conversation simulator.

Sure it's the best basketball game out there right now but if they keep going in this direction i can see an exodus of users when a competitor starts noticing and makes a better game, which wouldn't be that difficult.

This franchise has stopped respecting it's users and instead are manipulating kids into forking over their parents money.
Buy it in a sale (at best) or even better play real-life basketball."
7219,"fun
"
7220,very good

7225,"i cannot play online. i did`t receive any verification code to be able to proceed my player account. i also tried the manual verification in 2k site and  logging in manually using my steam account, still it pops up ""WE DID`T RECOGNIZE YOUR ACCOUNT IN OUR SITE"", i have also contacted 2k support. they did`t help at all. they did`t fix my issue. im so disappointed buying this f****** game."
7226,Been playing NBA 2k since the original. Best basketball experience out there. Really enjoying MyTeam.
7227,God i hate this damned game
7228,"spending pretty much your money to pulls the new release card and get nothing
"
7229,amazing
7230,basking ball
7231,Fun game I suck at shooting but fun making a player.  I have only played single player and that's all.  I will never contribute to the B*** S*** pay to win. AKA don't play multi player if you do not have a high disposable income.  If you have a disposable income that you can waist on something that you will lose in less then a year then go right ahead.  I do not have that luxury.  For single player very fun but multiplayer be prepared to spend money to be good.
7232,THIS GAME BLOWS. PLEASE FIX EVERYTHING GAME SUCKS.
7233,ive put 35 hours in 5 days.....
7234,"This 2k sucks. I have not had fun with a 2k since 2k16. Please save your money, I wish I hadn't put as much time into this game as I have."

7247,"This game on PC is atrocious. IT WONT EVEN RUN SOMETIMES. If you are a MyLeague player like me, do not buy this game on PC. It will freeze your entire PC while looking at rosters, draft classes, or anything with lists. I have had to force restart my PC probably 30-50 times because of this. DO NOT GET THIS ON PC"
7248,I recommend it if you want to re think your life because of how many people cheat on the pc port :)
7249,... rada.
7250,a
7251,because this game is so amazing not like my expert
7252,good geim i laik wery
7253,"Better than 2k19 - No
Recommended for - Basketball fans of all ages with zero to little access to a console or money to buy one. Everyone else - NO."
7254,"When i push the rt button, my stamina always decrease. But my player wont sprint at all"
7255,Fun 2k21 needs voice chat to talk to your opponents.
7256,"It's such a shame that 2K is the only basketball game out there because they do such a poor job. Never once while playing this game have I ever though, ""wow, this was really well designed."" The only thing that improves from year to year is the graphics, everything else is the same, if not worse. The sheer lack of effort, attention to detail, and creativity is disgusting."
7257,Fantastic game if you like basketball. Most of the bad reviews I think are from the virtual currency thing or from players who don't want to grind/level up their characters. Its enjoyable both singleplayer & multiplayer.
7258,Its awesome

7268,literally a broken game. Went on from not being able to go online and losing my mycareer save files TWICE. Literally wasted my time and money playing this game. BIG thumbs down.
7269,"online é horrível, mas o jogo em si é bom"
7270,Best sports game on steam atm
7271,I think this game is fine for the most part but i cant play park. Every time I go into the neighborhood after a minute or so my game crashes.
7272,"First time playing a NBA game, Takes some time getting used to controls. especially if you do not know how to play basketball lmao. But once u figure that out its really fun and stressful lol 9/10"
7273,too hard to play defense and it's look like they already decided what games we have to lose.
7274,çöp
7275,"If you enjoy grinding for skills, like in life, then you'll love this game. Badges are how you become great at the game, you MUST put in time to get these badges. Other than that, the game is extremely fun solo, but if you have friends, the REC and Park are that much better. If you're a solo player, MyCareer might be the only thing for you, you need friends to be effective/have fun in REC/Park."

7300,"The gameplay is very smooth compared to nba 2k19 and it feels way better when you shoot.Also,the park is more complex even tho it seems like it's the same one from 2k19."
7301,Mycareer is amazing the grind is long but worth it. I played with the 76's and a few season in lots of players retire the only bad thing is on court online matches can be a bit laggy.
7302,good for who love basketball
7303,Park is soooo laggy.
7304,"if youre playing online and likes getting raped by 2k, then maybe you will like this, but if your are playing offline, you better find something else to do since 2k dont give a shit about offline players."

7320,good game
7321,"Crashed out all of the sudden and doesn't work anymore ,sometimes when you play it gets stuck during a timeout as well...no updates to fix it. It's a shame because it's great game when it works as intended."

7323,its pure cancer
7324,"Dont even bother buying if you play on High Refresh rate, it doesnt work. The game is newer than 2k18 and 2k19 which both supported High refresh rate gaming."
7325,its a good game but everytime i go to the bench i cant sim too my next play its super dumb
7326,"Buggy, micro transaction filled, unplayable mess.
Online mode has not worked since I purchased it, tons of hackers. Avoid this game."
7327,love it
7328,"As an offline sports game, it sets the standard. MyGM is the most in depth franchise mode in a sports game I have ever played. If you are interested in buying this game to play MyPlayer or any online modes for that matter, I would not recommend this game due to microtransactions and the play to win formula 2K have implemented."
7329,i cant sim i hate this game waste of money
7330,"While I would love to say 'Yes', as I did have my fair share of fun playing the game, because of all the garbage littered throughout the game, I simply can't. Underneath all this pile of trash is truly an amazing game with the potential no other sports game atm can match, but there's simply too many piles of trash for that gem to shine.

If you do plan on getting it, get it on the max sale that you can, but not the full price. Anyway, as I don't want to write an essay on this, here's a list. That's a popular thing, right? 

Pros: 
It looks pretty enough
Gameplay for certain archetypes is really fun
Pretty good diversity in builds, even if only the select few-ish are truly viable 
A lot of (fairly unique) events that come and go at a decent pace

Cons: 
The whole grind aspect (rant: I honestly don't mind the VC grind despite the fact that it can be suicidal, especially if you want to have more than 1 player, but the badge grind is simply... just... awful. It is, by far, the most soul-sucking mechanic I've experienced in the game. The reason is simple: badges are everything in this game. Your stats literally don't matter. You can be a 95OVR, but if you don't have any badges, your player will be garbage. You can pretty much kiss any online play goodbye until you grind out the main HOF badges for your build, as they literally make or break your character. Furthermore, gaining XP for them through organic gameplay is so goddamingly slow you will develop suicidal thoughts about a third into it. That's why, by far, the best way to grind them out is to cheese the living hell out of the game's bombastically dumb AI, and even then it takes far too long, and it's just... boring. So, yeah, if you thought grind was bad in previous 2ks, oh boy, do you have another thing coming)
Servers -- as with every year before, since the time immemorial, servers are a hit or a miss. One day I'll be playing park/rec/am as smoothly as a butter, and the next I'll be lucky to get a one game in without getting kicked right-the-hell-out of the game. 
Too-alt-unfriendly -- considering the diversity of builds, if you have no intention of buying VC, you really, really, really should look into what kind of a player you want, because grinding out a second will just kill you, not to mention any more than that. 
Everyone can shoot -- and I'm not even joking. If you know your release, and with a few shooting badges, even builds with like 63-64 3pt shot will be greening stuff all day long. What's even the point of sharpshooter builds? That's why 2-ways are as invasive as the shall-not-be-named-virus. 
Animations -- ball-handling is just... just bad, this year. You cannot blow past a defender, so you have to cheese with constant stepbacks and running up and down the court. They just feel clunky and slow, regardless of your ball handling attribute. Beyond that, contact dunk animations are just too basic, the bump is just annoying, the wrap-up where it sends you careening out of the f'in arena... c'mon, 2k. You literally remove animations every year to bring them back next year over as a 'feature'...
Guards are too OP -- 6'6, 99speed/acc PGs (virtually any archetype) are by far the most broken thing in the game. SF's, on the other hand, might be the worst thing since... I dunno, anything. 
Matchmaking is woefully inconsistent -- rec games can either be the place you have the most, or the least amount of fun in the game, depending entirely on the team-matchups. 81OVR team vs 83-4? Pretty good. 81 vs 92? You may as well leave. 

Anyway, I'm sure I missed some things, but I'm too lazy to think any longer, so there you go. Even with all of this, I still had a fair share of fun playing the game, especially once you get decent park/rec match without such a difference in rating skill just goes out the window. MyCareer (offline) is a bit too basic and is honestly there just to kind of grind out VC & Attributes/badges XP. Story is... fine? I mean, nothing spectacular, just sort of... okayish? I did have a couple of laughs, so there's that. I don't play MyTeam so I don't know anything 'bout that life, but MyLeague is probably the highlight of the entire game as you can customize it to all hell and run every imaginable simulation. Now that... that is diverse gamemode."

7347,The movement of players are all over the place. The dribbler coming off of screens slides a lot to the aspect it takes you out of position to make a decision out of the pick and roll. Jumpshot timing has to be a lil to spot on. Not for the computer because if you are playing on hall of fame the computer is a little to unrealistic with the shots they hit. I only play the franchise mode.... and its very lack luster. Where is the Western Conference MVP award?? Where is the ceremony for the MVP award?? ITS 2020 stop shorting me on the franchise mode! During the all star game wheres the skills challenge or the celebrity all star game. You got the celebrity cyberfaces in the game so why we cant see those! 2k YOU GETTING LIKE EA is about Madden.

7372,"Update in 2022:

Just noticed that 2K20's server was shut down, which shut down MC for for no good reason.

It was the player's data, player's money that traded for stats in MC. You just shut it down even without any data migration to future 2Ks?

2K is a crappy company and I saw it coming from their biased politics on BLM. I read that in 2K2022 MC they injected some female player agent, equal right BS again. Could it be that the industry is not biased, but that FEMALE agents don't want to be agent for MALE clients and vice versa? Why broadcast some fake feminism BS while you treat players like sh*?

F**k 2K.

Update: Today NBA 2K dared to force me to watch a 30 seconds BLM political ad when I started a match. Really? 

Who do you think you are? The ad said silence = murder then asked people to vote, obviously for Democrats. What is it? Do you 2K drughead marketing managers know that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer cannot even read George Floyd's name right?

Original Review:

Downtime for George Floyd ONLY, really? Why can't you keep your political message out of video games? Does Mr. Floyd have anything to do with the NBA?

How about you ALSO honor the innocent lives and properties being taken away in the riots?

How about instead of shoveling a political message down the players throat, you actually make the game better? Like a BLM dedicated event is better than this ""memoriam"".

Updated: Saw the T-shirt dedicated to BLM. That's the way to make a public event blend into your game. The players can have a choice to wear it and walk around. Just don't force any message onto people."

I should just get attribute points while practicing and playing games like it was in the old games. It's too bad because the actual gameplay seems pretty good.

EDIT: after playing MyCareer for some more time I encountered a nasty progress-breaking bug. I cannot continue playing any more NBA matches because the game crashes as soon as I try to load the next match. I don't feel like making a new MyCareer if this can happen again. Definitely don't recommend this game, and if the next one will be similar with it's online dependency, gambling, p2w and coin grinding I will not buy it for sure."

7461,"If you've ever played a NBA 2K game before you know exactly what your getting into. While I don't support 2k or it's Microtransaction-mania; or in-game advertisements; or incredibly obnoxious product placement; for the majority of the time this is a solid, playable game. So sit back and relax, as me and my 43 hours of in game experience take you on a journey into 2K tomfoolery.

Lets start with the actual basketball game mechanics. To sum it up, the gameplay in 2k20 is a smoother version of 2k19. Players will cut, drive and dunk much faster and have less of a chance of getting stuck to a defender who is spamming R2 (I swear every computer is doing it). 3-pointers are more important, players will attempt (and make) them at a higher rate. The AI generally has been improved too, they will make smarter plays, and play more like they're real life counterparts. They still get stuck on screens though, and occasionally get janky when it comes to contested shots off a pass, (or anything player initiated).

The music is the same-ish as the last few years; though I swear the variety in music genre is less and less as years go by. For the most part 2k20 just takes the top 50 artists and throw in they're B-list songs. Unfortunately nothings going to top Kurtis Blow or his Basketball song about Basketball.

MyCareer has gotten better; 2k seems to have reduced the grind and the importance of VC accumulation. It only took 10 hours of playtime to get my guy up to an 80 overall. Which is a significant improvement from other years where I went the entire NBA regular season only to peak at a solid 77 overall. The biggest change to MyCareer (and honestly the game as a whole) is to the player ""Archetype"" system. They give a lot more control in designing your players physical attributes. Skill-wise you get a nifty looking pie-chart that defines your overall in each main category (Finishing, Shooting, Playmaking and Defense). After that they let you edit your own skill caps for each individual skill (like 3-point shooting or Offensive Rebound), setting maxes to each skill based on the pie chart you selected at the beginning. If this sounds like a sham, that's because it kind of is; the only thing that matters is the pie chart you choose as the game will only let you max out your skills to fit that chart (give or take a few skill points). It gives you that nice veneer of player control without the actual ability to customize anything. Its not a perfect system, but it still gives you more control over your players play-style than last year, and its nice to know that 2K is willing to listen even just a little to the player base that complained about player archetypes in the past. Other than that MyCareer is essentially the same as 2k19 (with a different story of course). You take control of an up and coming NBA rookie, and navigate through at least one NBA season playing with (and against) the leagues best. All the while increasing your attributes with VC and getting cool endorsements/obvious product placement from real world companies (GATORADE WHOO).

 I don't play much in the way of My GM, but from what I've seen it hasn't changed from previous years. Online is a little sketchy, and you might have a little trouble getting into a game. But even that's playable if your willing to overlook the  occasional hour long wait time, and the occasional cheaters (one time the entire other team was on fire for the entire game). Every other game mode is pretty much the same. You still have your quick-play, your season mode, and the illustrious franchise mode. These are all effectively the same as last year, which for me  is fine because how much is a regular season mode going to change in any sports game. League expansion is still here as well, for all of you who wanted to navigate the Flint Tropics to another NBA title.

All in all the game itself isn't that bad, not much has changed from 2k19, the stuff that has changed is mostly for the better. 2K' s VC nonsense is still here but at least in MyCareer they've significantly nerfed it's importance in terms of overall player development. And yes in game ads are a thing, but they're not as bad/invasive as people make them seem. They're mostly for in game apparel, or custom animations. Things that don't really affect gameplay at all. And nothing that other games don't already do (I'm looking at you Fortnite). The worst is the 2k video series that plays every time you load a game. I'm convinced that nobody actually interacts or watches these, except for when they offer free VC for answering a poll. My biggest gripe with the in game currency is that short shorts for your My Player cost 5,000 VC. I had to grind 5 NBA regular season games out just so I could show off a little leg in the neighborhood.

If your thinking about buying the game, at this point I would wait for it to go on sale. Either that or wait for 2k21 to come out.

TL:DR 2K20 has made small, but mostly positive changes to 2K19, and has downplayed the importance of in game VC (its still there). I'm interested on whether 2k will continue to make changes based on user feedback. Maybe someday that will mean the end of VC, and in game ads? Idk as long as I get to customize my own GATORADE bottle I won't complain.

Oh and the MyCareer cut scenes are still pretty cheesy, but I mean what do you expect? Its a game about basketball, not a Disney Original Series."
7462,Buggy as all hell. Player models just disappear from view randomly in My Career cutscenes. Horrible lag when trying to edit the appearance of My Player. I last played this game as NB 2k15 and it was pretty good. Somehow 2k have managed to remove good aspects of the game and bring it down a notch. Most unforgivable though is the 'Pay To Win' mentality. 2k seems to care more about getting their customers to pay real monet for virtual clothes and accessories and to level up your player. Poor effort 2k. Won't be buying future versions.
7463, great game to play with friends and has a great MyCareer storyline as always!
7464,"joke of a game, actually have ads in game, game crashed randomly, myplayer mode won't simulate, no tech support whatsoever, so pitiful from a game series i used to love so much"
7465,james harden nerf please :)
7466,"Absolute dogsh!t servers, if you put my sh!t, horse sh!t, dog sh!t and cat sh!t then combine it, you have 2k20 servers. Logic is braindamaged like the servers, you make 30% contested shots and brick wide open slightly late shots. BuII$hit badges like intimidator and white kids that hack the game also make the community even worse. However the game is addicting and will make you a dropkick in the future as the community is full of 7-18yr old white kids. Not worth the 80gb download, I recommend you save that space for something else more important than this dogsh!t game."
7467,"amazing game, breathtaking graphic and mechanics of the game are wonderful, looking forward to future releases of these games."
7468,nice
7469,this game is one big ad with as much downtime and useless ass cutscenes as actual play time

7475,"The game is fun and all, until you play online. When you play offline against computers your fps is 170 plus but when you play offline your fps can only go 60 max and its very choppy. Its unplayable when you cant play park or my team and thats like the only fun in 2k"
7476,d
7477,good one
7478,"If you want a genuine 2k experience. Buy an xbox if you care that much, this shit is straight GARBAGE on pc apparently. The single players good but the multiplayer is when the game has its downfall. to Even compete in the playground, or any of the multiplayer modes at that you have to hack the living shit out of the game. Oh and did I mention theres no report function, yea nah its not there. it is on console tho

    This is a pure example of how console partnership ruins games for pc, console has loads more features and just evident effort that they refused to put into the PC ""port"" its almost like they get more money from console users buying VC (in game currency that you can buy with real money) The whole ""my career"" playthough is a marketing skeem to get you to buy VC. They do this by making progression for your character fucking SLOW. You could probably hit 60 in classic wow before you even get half your badges. 

I'd say get it on sale if your interested but DO NOT pay $60 for this dog shit"
7479,This game on PC is god awful. Do not get it at all please listen to me. I have played on Xbox and it runs better on Xbox than it does on PC.
7480,"Game mechanics are really bad.  I primarily play MyCareer, and player movement always feels clunky.  Overall Rating of 93, and movements are not smooth.  Player makes excessively unnecessary movements; jumpshot timing is inconsistent; winstreaks trigger a rubberband game where the opposing team just can't miss, and you and your team are missing every shot.  IMO NBA 2k10 and 2k11 are far better than this piece of shit game.  Also, I don't care for the cinematics.  So dumb that you had to hold A to skip EACH SEGMENT!"
7481,"Fun game, Good improvement from past 2Ks, and better player building"
7482,Copy Paste of 2k19 but somehow its 20x worse than that. Unless you cheat or spend your whole paycheck you'll never be able to compete. Games are so scripted that it rarely comes down to skill
7483,Doing me good so far... everything is clean so far
7484,"The game for some reason doesn't play like the Nba2k I remember .The last 2k i played was 2k18 for Xbox 360.I thought the older version ran smoother.Also come on Steam.A NBA2k with no voice chat,console 2k's get voice chat.Also i would like to say If It isn't broken don't fix it.Its Not like NBA 2k got any competition in the basketball games..On That note I give it a 7 out of a 10 and I'm a 2k Lover..I play on an Asus G75Vx gaming laptop,and it just doesnt feel as a fluid of a game from the past 2k's I've played."

7489,fd
7490,"absolutely awful game. stephen curry and klay thompson miss wide open threes, even contested threes that they would 100% make in real life. mycareer is very fun and i love the story they are doing with it but some of the interviews and dialogue just seems very stale and not realistic. also u can be the most mediocre rookie and they will praise u like ur some kind of god. also tons of hackers on PC where they boost themselves up to 95 overall and give themselves all HOF badges and maxed out stats but that doesnt really matter because u still have to green light every jumpshot and since there is so much latency and delay, its almost impossible to greenlight shots unless u have it memorized and timed to the absolute T. servers are not entirely dead but u just have to be in the right lobbies for mypark or certain times of day when everyone is playing."
7491,not recommended.
7492,like it
7493,"Bought it for 13 euros and that is still a little bit too much for such a game. If you have friends who are already playing it, then go for it, but if you want to play solo, dont even bother, you will have to grind harder than in Lineage 2 to get to 95 overall."

1. It's same with 2k19 but new rosters which you can download also from 2k19.
2. If you're a fan of WNBA you should try this out..
3. If you just want to waste money and buy stuffs like me. Buy this.

One thing I liked in this game is MyPlayer Builder. It let's you create or experiment your player Build before you use it in career mode.

7531,its very fun game
7532,"Is NBA 2K20 a good basketball game? I honestly have no idea. Although I am a huge basketball fan, I don't traditionally play any sports games. The main reason I purchased this game was because it was on sale and there was a desire to have something basketball related be in my life routine. Due to the cancellation of the NBA season because of the ongoing worldwide epidemic, I was feeling a bit off from not having any new basketball media to consume for my entertainment. If it wasn't for those circumstances, I probably would have never even considered purchasing this game. However, with all that said, it does in fact fill that niche I was looking for. I don't have much aspirations with this game beyond playing against the CPU with some of my favorite players, so it accomplishes what I was hoping for."
7533,"My career is such a waste of time. It's such a bad execution of a quest/RPG style. Unless you spend money on VC you'll get nowhere fast and your player looks like some JV scrub unless you're willing to grind and slog through endless bad results. Once you get good, you'll have to deal with the AI cheating you out of open lay ups and your teammates suddenly forgetting how to play basketball. I don't mind a competitive game, but it just feels like you're being cheated by the AI where it's an offensive rebound fest after you've played good defense or your players suddenly can't shoot. God forbid you get up more than a few points, the computer wants you to only be up 2 points and trade baskets until you miss a few and suddenly every possession for the AI is a fast break dunk or offensive rebound putback. So fun."
7534,"Honestly, as bad as it is to have to grind currency in the game to progress your character and get anything worthwhile, it's a really fun game.

If you're a fan of basketball, it's definitely worth buying on sale to have an updated basketball sim. 

The story was pretty cool but short, and has lots of cameos from players, stars, etc. MyTeam is fun if not stressful at times, and while apparently they haven't changed the Neighborhood in a few games, the events are really fun. 

Overall, this is a great basketball sim."

7572,"The worst servers that i've ever seen. Besides that, optimization really sucks. The game can be crashed in any moment. I cant play with my friend together normally in REC, cause he gets left. Plus some other bags happen during the game prcoess, in main menu and so on. 
As for gameplay, that is also different between online and offline gamemods, game of scripts, scripted animations, overall rating is decisive Previous parts were better according to speed and controlling the player's movement, physcis - u could feel it better. Now you feel like ur player got shit on himself and hardly moves, reacting on your combinations after 12429 years - our of sync.
You cant go against animation, when opponent pressed shooting while running to the rim in a distance of 3 km - he easilly dunks, doesnt matter that you pressed block or steal in time.
Dissapointed. I understand that it's mayeb difficult for you to invent something new, so okey, dont do it, just fix the bags and servers. U got money, dont u?"

7582,Good game
7583,"Its a almost perfect copy of 2k19 except the bugs/glitches are worse. These NBA2k games aren't getting any better and since they have no competition they can cut corners and sell this crap as a ""new game"". 
Packed with bugs that will ruin the players experience, glitches that can force you to restart the whole game mid match, cheating squads of 70 overalls in mascot outfits with crazy win/loss records and sometimes when loading into MyCareer/MyTeam you get the error message ""lost connection to 2k servers"" and then forced to wait 5 minutes to load back to title screen. But hey, at least the Graphics are ""better"" than last years! 

Glad i got it on sale and didn't waste money on the ridiculous $60+ price they still expect people to pay. 
Go back to 2k16 instead of worrying about this game"
7584,"If you have a lot of time and want to have a fun, you can buy it. But my career mode is so hard. Gaining VC is like a nightmare."
7585,"Okay lets get started with this.
This game is garbage and here's why:
1. Greed of the company called 2k sports destroyed this awesome game.
2. Cheaters are everywhere, and 2k doesnt care about banning them.
3. Gameplay was great for the first month of the game but, 2k decided to change it and it became T R A S H.
4. 2k support is really slow with responses (or in some cases dont reply).
5. MyTeam is ruined by ""position locks"" which had great potential, but 2k wanted money so they made op cards play pg (Thon Maker, Bol Bol).
If you only want to play this game offline, it may be worth it, but this game has significantly worse gameplay then past years, so i would think about that."
7586,"2K Developers must be banned on Steam. Such a trash game. A lot of bugs, hard to control your players .. in My Carrrer first 27 shots missed from easy positions. I hope very soon will be company, who will start creating a normal basketball games, because every year worse and worse from 2K...."
7587,Good game but wait til next year.
7588,"This is probably hands down one of the worst 2k games i've ever played for mycareer. You get stuck just trying to run by defenders. You'll be wide open and brick your shots. Your stamina will last you about all of 3 seconds before its gone and your dude needs to sit on the bench. Only get this game if its ""Free"" and even than play at your own risk."
7589,so disappointed. What is trash.
7590,"Great game, just needs a 2v2 mode. You can only play 1v1 as a whole team against friends online, otherwise to play with more you need to lock to a particular position which is not ideal."
7591,"This is my first nba game, so i like it. Simple"
7592,this game is absolute garbage. the worst out of all the 2ks. its not even worth the 20$ its on sale at right now. this game sucks really hard. DO NOT BUY
7593,Great Game on PC! Worth the $25

"
7605,Dont buy this shit. Its an ad.
7606,"This game is very close to unplayable.
First of all, if you decide to buy this game, make sure you have a controller with you as well, otherwise don't buy.
Secondly, there are too many glitches. Random crashes, many modes can't be played offline (and these modes are single-player modes!), and keys randomly not working (?).
If you have previous 2k, don't buy this one.
If you have to, wait on sale and buy under 20. This game does not worth more than that."
7607,Very noice. The MyLEAGUE is really great!
7608,"Please don't make the same mistake as me! 

Just dont the latency, and bugs are so annoying they occur like every second and plus the mycareer sucked
and even when you play myplayer you would probably screen tear so much and have too much lag. Just get it on console
dont make the same mistake as me

7619,"Very good NBA game and much improve compare my last nba game in 2010. A lot players online you can meet and play Mycareer like your style as customize yourself in NBA life and seasons. Very recommended to nba lover for 2k20. Very much had improved. This 2k20 you can get 4 modes 1 game such as street basketball, myCareer nba, nba team play, online pvp. Very nice graphic as well, let's meet online!"
7620,"Usually it's basically the same game year for year and if you want some good improvements you only should buy it every 3 years or so. This time it may be a bit different, cause one big weakness was being adressed. You can easily play around and create the player build that you really want to play. Furthermore you seem to get more VC and at the beginning a faster improvement of your player (to around 80 in 20-30 season games at standard difficulty for me and enough having fun dominating career games) while later in the game it becomes much harder to get from 80 to 90 or above. So the myplayer career mode over all improved and thats what i am playing. The storyline is mediocre, but we had so much worse in years before. After all i'm happy with the 2k20 version for about 15 bucks and it'll get even cheaper soon, i guess. It's worth it for mycareer players."
7621,Nice Gameplay options
7622,ds

7630,Best Game Ever
7631,while i attempted to play this after taking a long break from the franchise i decided to try 2k20. my decision to return this was not from micro transactions but the fact that this game just looks off.. like its dated and showing age. i felt no life in this title as i have seen in years before. i miss the days of just having a franchise mode. now they try putting a single player campaign in the game. it might be popular but to me i prefer all the office management. but those modes are taking a back burner it seems. maybe next years will revitalize the franchise.
7632,"great quality
"
7633,its fun
7634,terrible cloud storage and multiple missing mycareer save files. this game is always problematic and the support sucks
7635,this is my first 2k specially park online experience and probably my last one. definitely not gonna buy another 2k here on steam.  bunch of cheaters around you will see lots of legends poping out in nowhere. im a hardcore baller but i guess ill play this game on PS next release game not here on STEAM! cheaters annoying as f*ck!
7636,"What a garbage game. I got the Legend Edition for $20 and thought I may take a chance on it, but it really shouldn't have done that. My Career doesn't work somehow which was the main reason I wanted to get it, I just get a green screen with talking over it. Garbage game from a garbage company"

7652,"I have enjoyed 2K20 so far keeping in mind I have not played since NBA 2K16. The MyPlayer I feel like sometimes even though you run the offense perfectly it will find a way for your team to suck ass the whole game. Other than that it's a mayor improvement from the last one I played.

The online is horrible like always if your player doesn't have a 99 overall forget about playing a fair game. Grinding is tough even in the best case scenario where you get the best rating pre draft and the best rookie salary it will still push you to buy some VC since it saves you hours upon hours of grinding for a decent player."

7665,"its make me so happy and this is fan'
"
7666,I want to start off by saying that this is a decent  game. I really like how 2k tries to add more to their titles every year but they seem to only spend time on the modes that they can make a lot of money after people buy the base game such as my career and my team modes. There is a heavy presence of micro transactions in this title which is fine for people who have the money to burn but the game is VERY difficult for people looking to grind away to get a good player in career mode or a good team in my team mode. I really think that the game would be better with a lesser focus on micro transactions but I accept that 2k is a business focused on making money. I would recommend this game for people with either a lot of time on their hands or who have extra money to through at the game. Just be aware that the grind is a log one if you don't have to money to buy vc.
7667,"this is make me happy:)

I have a stable connection through ethernet cable. I have tried clearing the cache multiple times which takes a while and nothing. What's strange is the characters don't freak out like this until they are upgraded enough. I had a 60 overall character and had no issues. I buy some vc he is 77 and now I have issues with him. I have a 92 overall i can't get into because of this same issue. Please support the 2k community by not buying these games. This will be the last one for me.

So many f*&*&& cutscenes that are lame and add nothing to the story. I knew the reviews were bad but I've decided to give them a shot. NEVER AGAIN 2k WILL FOOL ME.

7687,2k are IDIOTS ! Eeverything in this game is f up ! DONT GET THIS GAME NOT EVEN IF ITS FOR FREE ! AND ALLSO BUY THIS GAME ONLY IF U GOT HACKS FOR IT OTHERWISE NOT WORTH IT AT AAAAALLL !

SO  yea in all ways this game is unfair not fun cuz u allways lose  if u not ovr 99 when u start the game then dont play it !  once again i say do not buy this game ! AND AMERICA U DUM F DONT SUPPORT THE FREAKIN 2k THEY SUCK !!!
7688,Very fun. Very cool. PSYCH RONNIE2K BE SLACKIN IN THAT GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT. STEP IT UP OR GET STEPPED OVER LIKE LOU. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
7689,"If you're a basketball fan it's a must own. I've played this franchise for years, it sucks you constantly have to buy every year but it's something you will do if you're a fan. Graphics are great, game play is great. PC is a little buggy at times but it's a great game. Simulating is always fun, and MyTeam is a great progressive play mode. I will most likely be buying 2k21."
7690,"I'm pretty dumb for buying this game. I wanted to try it out for myself and judge it myself and it sucks a lot. Earning vc through my career is very hard and going against ais are hard too. AI defense is too good, or maybe I am just really bad. Made a power forward who was good at post fadeaways and that move was reliable. That move only worked on regular role players, barely works on Giannes, AD, Embiid, Drumond, or any tier one center/ power forward. Also made a shooting guard, but can never get passed a defender. Again their defense is too good or I just suck. It sucks being a 60 overall going up against +75 overalls. Endorsements and endorsement bonuses help but the game is still very grindy. In order to reach (buy) your full potential you would need to pay for vc. To max your character you would need around 180,000 vc which is around $40. I am not saying that I want to start of as a 99 overall, but please give the players some free vc because you would have to put in hours of gameplay just to reach average. It took me about 11 hours for my PF to reach 71 overall and the game still sucks. My teammates miss wide open shots and shoots very contested shots, while enemy CPU always get green."
7691,The game isn't ready for PC. The bugs you have to deal with is absurd.

7701,Pay to be good = not good.
7702,"I should have realized what was up when I installed the game and discovered you can only play ""My Career"" online and logged in. (Ready to pay.)

The scripted of the STORY are actually pretty good.  Pretty immersive.  This would be a plus were it not for the fact that it's a set up.

I ground and I mean GROUND may way through the first 30 games of my rookie season.  If you help on defense, at all, you lose teammate grade for leaving your assignment, and it's harsh.  If you don't help on defense, the other team scores roughly 65% of the time while you are on the court.  I focused on staying on my defensive assignment, like the game seemed to want me to, and my player's +/- per 36 minutes played was -18.  The worst on the team BY FAR.  I tried to get assists, but discovered that almost every time I set up a team mate for a decent shot they either didn't shoot, made a needless move first thus negating the assist, or missed the open shot, in that order of frequency.  

I attended every single practice and did max drills every opportunity, without looking in to what this does for you too much.  You slowly unlock badges and I know those help, and you also unlock general ""attribute upgrades"" as you go.  What are the attribute upgrades?  The game randomly chooses attributes for you and increases the cap on that bar.  The higher you raise your attribute bar, the more VC it costs.  So by grinding away and earning ""My Points"" you are increasing the potential for you to spend VC to make your player actually better.  How do you earn VC?  You get a set amount for playing games, you get a smidge for stats, (you get 2VC for making a bucket and raising your attribute one bar costs over 1k when the bar is high already,) and you get a chunk for winning a game, (good luck with the hand of God scripting that goes against you and the difficulty settings that  you can't lower, only increase from default,) and you get a chunk for the grade your teammates give you, based on how team oriented your play was.  (In other words, how much you didn't try to alter their destiny and just went with the flow.)  

So after 30 games I had increased my overall to 79, and now the coach tells me I'm ready to start, benching a much better player.  I am stoked and go all in trying to play an efficient, team oriented game.  I get a tough defensive assignment but he only burns me about 3 times.  I get 7 assists by force feeding my open teammates at every opportunity.  I play crazy transition defense.  I don't iso a single time and get called out for bad shots.  I make a few last second buckets and go to the line a few times, scoring 12 on 56% FG.  I get more rebounds than normal.  I feel really good about the performance, (after all it was an A, which is rare for me,) and we win the game against a good team, at home.  

I head in to the locker room, and....

I apologize to the assistant coach, (the only staff member that actually ever talks to me,) with my head hung low, for ""letting the team down.""  I get blasted on social media for a disappointing start.  I have NO IDEA why.  I am stunned.  How could that possibly be bad?  We won, I got a team A, and I chose the team based dialogue options to max my team chemistry, and for some reason the game wants me to feel like I am inadequate.  

Wonder why that is?  

So I go to player progression to raise my stats a little, seeing as how I wasn't good enough to impress anybody after my best effort.  Turns out I had earned 1100 VC.  That was enough to raise 3 stats one bar each.  It did not increase my overall.

I don't mind the fact that it is a serious GRIND to improve.  I actually like that long term sense of progression this sets up.  But the game shames you for not being good instantly, it stacks the deck to make it tougher on you than it should be, and the only way to change your fate is to pay real cash.

So know that about My Career if you are interested in that aspect.  It's a trap.  Don't get the game just for that.  (Or actually, now that they knocked $40 off the price, right after I bought it....maybe go ahead and take a flier on it.)"
7703,"im too good honetly

7704,garbage game lmao

7708,"This game fucking sucks and is one of the worst games ever published. The unrealism of this game cannot even be measured. I'd only recommend this game for you, if you are VERY VERY VERY FUCKIN PATIENT, because if not you are gonna be driven crazy by this shit. Best regards..."
7709,"I think that the producers and developers think of us, the NBA2K PC gamers, as fukn retarded.

This game would be terrible, even if it was free to play. I have been playing for 6 months. The servers are always shitty, there are constant bugs, and hundreds if not thousands of ""hackers"" (you can ""hack"" the game by paying at various pretty easy to find sites)"
7710,aeesome game
7711,nice basketball game
7712,Trash ass game. Can't even make a layup right the fuck underneath the basket. Game is a joke. Never buying a 2k game again
7713,Online mode in playground is broken. Full of cheaters also
7714,So when you buy this game you pretty much wasted your money on a munch of error codes

7726,good
7727,"This game is great! However, playing on keyboard is harder than I expected it to be. I don't have the button for shooting, so most pf the time I take the ball up the court and pass it to a teammate. If it would be easier for a laptop like the one that I use, I would not have these complaints."
7728,"Remember all the fum times you had back in the day playing 2K? 
Yea well they took everything that used to be fun about it and made it pay to win garbage
Best looking trash I've seen in a while tho."
7729,"complete utter trash, game mechanics are broken, badges are overpowered, cant make layups unless your a 99 overall 7'3 interior force, not to mention having it on steam is so much worse, good luck trying to join a rec game (you wont), the park servers are eh, i lag alot, but the funniest part to me is having a legend teammate rated 50 overall that plays like they just got the game"
7730,"shit game dont get it
EDIT: fuck this game it is the faggat game all money you cant do anything screw this game and your mothers."
7731,Worse player defense and team ai i have ever seen. Games that are over ten years old have better and smarter ai then this. Almost all game my own team mates run directly into my character or step directly in my straight line path. Should have never payed for this game 2k15 is a better game then this.

Dont get me started on the 129354719857 unskippable cutscenes, or the retardedly over the top detail in how your created character can take every single shot and how that drastically effects the shot-timing system so there is little/no muscle memory benefit.

7769,Good
7770,"First time I've tried NBA2k in a few years.  It was decent before.  I used to enjoy the career mode and the struggles and growth.  But it's horrible this year.  Unless you want to cheese it, and play the game in ways it's not intended to be played, it's virtually impossible to even make a wide open 6 footer.  This is despite my character being a 1st round draft pick.  Makes zero sense."
7771,not that gr8 but what else you got

There's also some modding going on long arm's, Steve Urkel looking My Players. I could do without that. PS4 is more competitive.

Holla at ya boy on Steam, Rich Dinero. If you don't play or understand basketball, you probably wont enjoy it. Competition is silly easy on Steam having said all that. BALL IS LIFE $DINERO"

When trying to launch, i get a black screen that won't even let me end the task with task manager. I have to restart my pc everytime. My time played on record is me trying 15 different solutions on how i can possibly get the F'n game to launch. Wasted even more time researching the web to find a solution, ie. Microsoft visual ++ changes, verifying local game files, changing to windowed mode. Finally just decided to give up. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!"

7808,Worst NBA 2K game I've ever played.  I've been playing NBA 2K since early 2000's and have always loved them.  This game makes me never want to purchase another NBA 2K game again.  I have a very high-end Graphics Card and an Intel Core I7 CPU and this game lags like no other game I've played before.  I looked it up on Google and it turns out that  the majority of the people who have this on the PC have the exact same problem; no matter how high end their computer hardware is.  I'm extremely disappointed in this game; please don't waste your money.
7809,"if its on 70%+ sale buy it , otherwise its not worth it"

7856,"bad game always crash
a lot of hackers in park
*NO ANTI CHEAT*
and i pay for this shit"
7857,"I bought this game so that I could make a super team with my favorite players but the developers went out of their way to make everything as complicated and counter intuitive as possible. The game modes and set up are just way too confusing. I am still trying to figure it all out but Reggie Miller, Charles Barkley do not even appear to be in the game. I used to be able to make my ""super team"" years ago (not sure which version of 2k it was but I would definitely not suggest this game to any of my friends). The game play is fine. There are some good points to the game such as the ""all time"" versions of the teams. The closest I was able to get to my super team was the 80's/90's all star teams."
7858,awesome
7859,2k is terribly neglected by developers all around without an anti-cheat and shitty community full of cheaters n know it alls.
7860,"This game is a scam. You can pay for everything with Virtual Coins that you need to buy for real money. MyCareer mode sucks so much it's unbelievable for a price of 60 £ You're given some cringey nickname ""Che"" you can't even change and can only choose a secondary nickname. Why 2k can't stop making up these foolish nicknames ? Prelude is very long for a sports game. You spend like 40 mins watching some bad acting scenes then play actually play basketball for ~5 min and wait another 40mins of cutscenes. Also, draft night is NON-EXISTENT. You play a prelude that long pretending to try to stock up in the draft and eventually you just get to choose what team drafts you. WHY?? Somehow there is also an imaginary friend in the league that they keep talking about. WHY DOES HE EVEN EXIST ?? I don't care for him at all. This is MY CAREER.

Long story short the game is not worth a penny folks if you own 2k19. Gameplay is just the same as in 2k19 and you better not waste your 60 pesos."
7861,"While I really enjoy the game I have to say it crashes more than any game I have ever seen before. It also gives you no reasoning for it. Just randomly crashes in the middle of any and everything you might be doing e.g. practice, games, roaming the neighborhood, looking in you menu, etc. It's not my PC, it's not windows, it's an issue that apparently doesn't get fixed."

7877,"I'm very much enjoying this game.  Very dynamic system of defense and offense.  For reference, I'm new to basketball videogames (Besides the NBA Jam series some 2-3 decades ago) so those that are frustrated with a lack of improvement since NBA 2k14 may be correct in their assessment.  

I am just having a blast with my career, my team, (Idris Elba and Rosario Dawson and Thomas Middleditch?  Well, this is above and beyond what's expected from me).  The 3 on 3 games are fun.  The throwback teams are fantastic (Jordan v Lebron James?)

Just a great time so far.  2 biggest complaints though are - Face scan with the nba app was terrible.  It took 20 attempts as there were constant errors with the app, uploading it to the servers, or downloading it to your game.  Eventually I got a very bad face scan that looks nothing like me.  

I played 1 game online with 90mbps internet and got a juttery though playable experience.  It definitely stutters much more than single player, which limits my desire to play it compared to the silky experience offline.  If I had friends I would invite them over to play in real life.

I mean.  I have friends.  But it's the pandemic.  It's not a lack of friends at all.  Yes.  

And that's all I got to say about that.  

9/10 Review based on 9 hours played.  PC is i5 9400 with RTX 2070 and an SSD.  Load times are slightly annoying, but not too bad."
7878,to freaking hard. not fun when you keep loosing and the player is slow
7879,"Realism is out of the question, this game absolutely sucks, I tried with many slider setups but scoring a basket is impossible, the AI is broken, my teammates behave like idiots on the court, match ups are broken and it's impossible to press a player defensively, plus after the 3rd quarter magically all my players stop scoring no matter what I do or where I shoot from while the other team transforms into the freaking dream team, 2k20 really sucks"
7880,"The eyes look $-:@(/-"""
7881,Very entertaining for single player. Keeps you up all night.
7882,"nice
"
7883,It's pretty fun
7884,"Its really fun would recommend it, the only problem with the game is the keyboard some of the controls are not there so I would recommend with controller's ."
7885,09
7886,honestly straight pissedi have had problems with every possible thing in this game ive lost 2 mycareer save files for no reason that i spent $30 for on each yet hackers are walking around with no problems with 99 ovr wtfff and i cant sim when im on the bench so i cant even make it past the first mycareer game biggest waste of money ive ever spent
7887,"Don't get the game if you want to have a fantasy style MyCareer mode, rookie mode has been removed from MyCareer and the forced advertising has only gotten worse in the game. You cannot skip a timeout until about 10 seconds since they want your eyes on Gatorade logos and other product brands in the area and other meaningless animations are also unskippable, 2KTV is another unavoidable sight loading into MyCareer games and MyCareer is very grindy in this game. The scripting since 2K18 has been getting even worse and there are games where you are scripted to just be bad where your team gets blown out by double digits or your character suddenly starts to brick open shots and CPU defense is like a cloning facility of Ben Wallaces."
7888,"This is a buggy piece of shit. Do you want to play a full game and have the game of your life only to have it tell you that there is something wrong with the 2k servers so nothing you just did gets saved and you have to play the game over again? If you like that then sure, play this trash game."
7889,This game is broken. I would say just get it in console but it's broken there too.
7890,trash
7891,nba is the real shiz yo
7892,You reach and the CPU will teach.
7893,"No dislikes.

Think game runs just fine as it always has. Good fun"
7894,shit game. crashes all the time
7895,"dammm just baught this game for PC, but all the layout is for PS, is there a way to change it? 
I cant even exit the game normally, amd all the moves ex[lanations are also via PS controler. 
"
7896,"epic
"
7897,"I like this game very much. Good graphics, nice game. Can defentenly be recommended"
7898,Played this series since 2k11 and the experience has depreciated yearly. MyCareer should be a single player experience.
7899,RIP Kobe
7900,the my career is full of crap.
7901,"Best game ever
"
7902,Will be getting this on the PC from now on. looks way better on a laptop then the switch. the games a bit choppy for me but I'm able to work with it and its not a huge factor. I'm also excited to see how many hours i actually put into this game because i kinda find that interesting...
7903,FIREEEEEEEEEEE
7904,"Nice game only problem is the server, sometimes always disconnecting"
7905,Not as bad as I thought it would be for online. Minus the hackers in MyPark.
7906,thumbs up
7907,"Ok, Fine."
7908,THE BEST
7909,waste of time
7910,My Career and Online sucks. My League and MyGM are still good though.
7911,:)
7912,"yes
"
7913,"nothing but a cash grab from typical 2k. Micro transactions galore, badges dont do anything, upgrading your player does nothing, miss wide open layups, annoying mechanics, crappy servers."
7914,its fire download it please
7915,although i cant stop playing its a fucking cash grab and a half myteam has so much potential but they constantly shit on it with galaxy opals in feb
7916,niggas fucked up inna crib buying 2k
7917,"I just want to vent that on the higher difficulties the physics literally do not make sense. When two centers have their and on the ball of a guard trying to dunk, there is no possible way that he can still dunk. Basketball simulation my ass
"
7918,"basketball is good, yes. Good."
7919,trash game trash company
7920,"MyTeam or Park are unplayable in Brazil. 2K, it's so easy, we just need a brazilian or south american server. Honestly, it's disrespectful to make us pay the full launch price without a server. I love NBA basketball but sadly, the game can only be played offline by south american players. I can't play even with my cousin in the same city, because the server is in the US..."
7921,"One of the only games I have felt bothered to review. A ton of negative comments on here about this game.....

All I can say is I am really enjoying it. I have been playing 2K games since Dreamcast so I have a descent understanding of what makes a basketball game fun. Sure my review is slanted...I avoided a lot of the modes people complain are ripe with cheaters. I wonder though, if you enjoy basketball games why do you keep returning to a mode ripe with cheaters when this game has soooooo much content.

The good. There is so much customization. From the players to teams names. You can run seasons in both standard and GM mode which in itself is enough to keep anyone busy for a year if your a bball sim fan. You can custom create a player and bring them into the L this way without grinding a single game to make them good. Custom rosters you can add into the game to keep it fresh are always fun. The My Team is awesome to me. Has the fun of collecting cards while also playing 2K. Sure the contract systems is BS, spend your MT wisely. I look for PD cards with a diamond contract card already applied. If you chase cards and spend your money foolishly you will have issues with contracts. 

The My Player is also fun. The cut scenes run too long and carry little value but can all be skipped. I am only 20 games into my season but so far I am enjoying the season (single player) mode of My Player. I understand there is a lot of cheating online. I have yet to attempt that and likely in the time I have to actually put into this game will never get there.

This is a review I threw together with no plan. I guess my message is if your looking for a BBall sim with tons of modes this is a fantastic game. As I mentioned the single player modes alone can keep you busy for a year. I do understand there are people who are grinding for leader boards against cheaters online. However this can be avoided and the game still fully enjoyed for hours and hours.

I would say the hate on 2K for the micro transactions isn't right. Sure there are pay to win modes in this game. Also there is a more fleshed out single player 2K experience than other iteration of 2K that has come before it. If you don't like certain modes I am sure you will find ones you do like. If 2K has to include some BS modes that can be completely avoided to include this much amazing Basketball single player modes then I say what is the harm? Different strokes for different folks. I can say this is the most complete Basketball SIM that has ever existed."
7922,is ok
7923,The basketball is fine but hasn't gotten much better over the past few iterations.  Myplayer is a grind and not fun to play regardless of if you've spend VC to buy skill points.  Don't mess around with the other stuff so idk about any of that.  Buy it because there's literally nothing else and pray for EA (LOL) to release a good version of NBA Live sometime this decade.
7924,fun
7925,fix your server problems you ********* ****-eating company. **** you
7926,wow
7927,There are too many silly animations and there is no button for skipping said silly animations. Also the gameplay could be more intuitive.
7928,"There's never been a game which has made me Alt+F4 more than 2K20. I air-ball uncovered shots, and make deep 3 pointers with 99% coverage. My bailed passes always result in a turnover, and player IQ is at an abysmal low. You'll somehow manage to bring yourself up to a B+ rating and suddenly Klay Thomson appears and steals the ball and drops your B+ to a D-. However, it is my first time playing any NBA game since 2K12. Overall, it's aight."
7929,get fucked by microtransactions
7930,"YOURE FUCKING GAME SUCKS 2KSPORTS! if your going to buy this game don't stray to my career, your team is stupid once you get to the nba like the developers of this game."
7931,"good basketball game
"
7932,My Career ftw.
7933,"2k refuses to optimize the game, complete garbage, park barely works, if you reset your facescan midway through season it breaks the game.  0/10 wouldnt reccomend

still gon play it tho"
7934,OKK
7935,dream
7936,"great game
"
7937,Dumpster fire. They somehow make this game more cancerous with every iteration. Thank God I didn't pay full price
7938,epic but controls not configured well for keyboard
7939,good game for basketball entusiasts
7940,very nice
7941,Great Game but its too laggy on some parts of the game and shuts me out of the game mid-way sometimes which is frustrating.
7942,If you like basketball at all you will like this game
7943,dog shit
7944,"this game lowkey ain't bad. i must admit, it's a bit of a grind fest but it's good for casual play"
7945,"The amount of grinding in my career to be even the slightest bit useful in MyPark now is actually not fun AT ALL. I bought this game after playing from 2k15 to 2k18 on PS4 and I loved the game, never played a sports game as fun and competitive and now the badges, omg the badges are sooo bad its untrue, badges seem to work for defence TOO MUCH but badges for shooting........ you can make a sharpshooter at 92ovrall with all shooting badges and still..... if its not a green perfect release itsa bricked shot and misses, Not to mention literally Every person in park is a cheater, Its just cheater after cheater, you find 60 rated players that have all the animations that Legends have and park dunks etc. and speedboosting at 7'0ft tall and shooting 3s from anywhere. If you cheat yourself it is kinda fun but everyone is 99 rated so its just cheater against cheater which isn't fun when you do it for a while, save yourself some money and wait till they fix the game. The jumpshot is a completely different timing in Mycareer too in comparison to mypark and all other gamemodes !"
7946,better than last years
7947,change the fucking icon button please
7948,sexi
7949,mehhhh
7950,nicee
7951,fun as hell
7952,"I like it
"
7953,good
7954,"oh yea bud
"
7955,its fun
7956,THE ONLINE LAG IS UNPLAYABLE
7957,cool
7958,"I was a huge fan of 2K for the longest time. Each year I have liked these games less and less, but this year was the last straw. I had dropped 2K completely because the online modes have become Pay to Win and the online community has become extremely toxic. I had originally purchased this game for PS4, but now that I have a better PC, I decided to give the game another shot strictly offline and with mods.

This game is totally fun and amazing with mods. But stay away from the online modes. If you want to just play MyLeague or offline MyCareer, then this is a great sim. The modding community has amazing mods for better player  faces and bodies, better courts, and better lighting / graphic enhancements."
7959,"its a glitchy basketball game. wanted a fix of basketball during no sports, dont hate the gameplay but hate how it doesnt work"
7960,"Dogshit of a game, don't buy it"
7961,no work
7962,"It is fun,"
7963,The online does not work on this game and its the only reason I wanted to play. Spend too much time building a character and now I am denied a refund. Stay away from this piece of garbage.
7964,"I bought this game to play with  my friends, and none of us managed to connect to online server to play.
We were disconecting from 2k servers all time.

Do not buy this game."
7965,gud game
7966,Great
7967,"Good game mechanism 2k. This work out to me
"
7968,I read all the comments and buy it anyway but damn this was the worst game experience in 2 hours. Had to give it back. MyCareer is not working properly. You can't play as 4 friends. Worst user interface I have ever seen in a game. You have to watch shitty unskipable videos. It was just bad. Everywhere is microtransaction.
7969,"i love this game so much its a grind tho !
"
7970,this is by far the worst 2k ever.
7971,Best 2k of all.
7972,It's prettty nice sinds I played it for 10 hours
7973,Fun game good soundtrack
7974,"it is a waste of money and it really makes me rage
"
7975,"OMG, just started the MyCareer Mode, and I thought after having skipped the last 3 releases that they went and fixed their broken ass mechanics, but no, oh NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
They added a lot of borinf idiotic cutscence, a terrible terrible boring and bugged to hell training camp with ""minigames"" that do not work, are no fun and really take forever sadly unskippable!!! Fuck this mess of a game instant refund, bur NOOOO as it takes over an hour until you can actually play no more refund.... 
STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!"
7976,Nice game 10/10
7977,b
7978,"This is a PAY TO WIN GAME. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Also there is no option for subtitles. You get too many fouls when you try to steal the ball. I Did not get as many fouls for stealing in NBA 2k19. Even with the steal stats maxed out trying to steal is pointless because you will get a foul and the other team will get a free throw and will score every time with their aimbot freethrows. Let me also let you know that YOU WILL BE PAYING TO WATCH UNSKIPABLE ADVERTISMENTS in a $60 dollar game!! The developers swapped out the steal button for a personal foul button.THE NEIGHBORHOOD DOES NOT WORK. Every time i try to play a game in the neighborhood i get the message ""A problem has been encountered that prevents gameplay from continuing. This game will not be counted."""
7979,Its fucking fun
7980,"it was 20 bucks so its good
"
7981,So f$@ked up! A few improvements from the previous installment. That's it! $h!t can't even change your players name once created. Otherwise you have to start all over.
7982,"this game is good if you play it good i play it good so game is good
"
7983,"Pretty much the same game every year, still enjoyable."
7984,An instalt to the 20 centery gaming graphiques are cubique
7985,"great looking basketball game and fantastic feel to ball handling only major complaint is of course how hard is it to grind up your character without IRL money and no MYcourt upgrades outside of Neighborhood rank up, also no 2k beats in NBA games so the arena music feels pretty empty"
7986,nice
7987,ok the online its acceptable
7988,"WORST game ive ever played so pay win and when you do play it just fucking crasehs, all in all dog shit game
"
7989,nice
7990,Gratest 2k ever!
7991,Too many bugs. Stupid shit
7992,"fuck this game because my mycareer data always suddenly lost fk
"
7993,"As a solo player who dont care about online and multiplayer, the game is good."
7994,"this game is lit
"
7995,"There is a nba in 2k downloaing game updates I waited 4 hours and did not download , and a message to nba and did not reply to solve the problem"
7996,"The game plays fine. Everything is just that...fine. But when features are removed year after year, when 2k15 is literally the best iteration of this game and has MORE in it, I am disappointed in the developers. They're clearly looking to maximize profit at the expense of the game. I sincerely hope a competitor emerges and puts this shoddy outfit out of business."
7997,really great game luv it
7998,"guud
"
7999,its fun
8000,Decent game but online unplayable
8001,game
8002,idk why people say its bad and theres hackers but i only play mt so
8003,i like
8004,Hackers
8005,"I wouldn't have recommended it if it wasn't on sale, but since it's only fraction of cost now then why not, its a decent game, no bugs and it's grindy nature isn't really a big deal with its current price tag."
8006,BEST BASKETBALL SIM HANDS DOWN!!!!
8007,"Thought I'd give this a shot with the hope it would be any less frustrating, glitchy, pay-to-win, incomplete or repetitive. I was horribly wrong.

Entirely non-consumer friendly. Unlike many other sports games on the market, this one fails to deliver for a modern game at many points, and hasn't changed much since 2K16.

Cannot make it any more clear that this game should not be purchased. Of the 60 hours I've played this game, I've enjoyed around 5. 

The Good:
- It's the NBA

The Bad:
- Graphical glitches and bugs common, weird in-game camera issues, player animation issues, black screens are still common, even 8 months after release. Kick-balls that don't register, getting 100% contested shots when AI is 1 metre away. Players that clip each other

- Loading screen adverts for TV shows, clothing brands (in a full price, AAA game? Nice.) 

- Unskippable nightmare. Expect the exact reused same halftime and timeout animations every single game (which are unskippable for 5-10 seconds). You'll be sick of any time stops after watching these. Game total recaps that completely kill the pace of the game. Obnoxiously long pre-game animations, freethrow rituals, timeout and halftime animations.

- Game modes which make any team you play for have an imbalanced disadvantage to the AI. Commonplace is a MyCareer game with an A+ teammate grade, 30-10-10, be benched and come back 20 points down. Classic. 

- The game promotes in-game purchase in order to remove these built-in frustrations. How can players be encouraged to improve their court vision when none of the AI-team can defend the paint man-on-man, forcing the player to play hero-ball.

- Almost impossible difficulties for new players, again encouraging purchasing in-game currency to reduce the learning curve."
8008,"Cant even play mycareer cause theres a bug that wont let me download game updates. Shitty game, shitty developer."
8009,"I normally don't take the time to review anything but I am extremely disappointed in this 2k. I've been a hardcore 2k fan every year and have always been one of the top players online. I have a fluid understanding of the game and all basketball mechanics.

However, this year they have really screwed up the shot system and for some reason I cannot get the hang of the timing. I can't win any games and can't hit any jumpers even with wide open shooters. The reason for this is that the game makes it incredibly difficult to hit a shot unless you green bar the meter, even wide open. The shot percentage is like at 20% unless you get an all green bar meter which is something I can maybe do 1 out of 10 shots. 

everything else I can deal with, the clumsy ball handling, the poor AI . I can deal with that, nothing new. But when you can't make any shots wide open with perfect scoring shooters... there is a huge problem with the game. 

2k is ruined for me forever since this is the direction they've gone down. I've played every year since the first 2k and I don't think I can play basketball again. I'm going to stick to strategy games instead of sports now. 

It's been nice playing with you over the years but I'm done"
8010,If you have friends to play with this then this game is super fun to play
8011,"Only game I play, love the game. I play Rec/Park for the most of the time. Few events 
here and there ,but find them boring since they're the same as last year. But
it's basketball, so not sure what else they could add in events.


What could be improved in future games/ updates: 

I want to say ban cheaters, but if they started doing that they prob ban a lot of people. Which means those people prob don't buy next years game. If way less people buy game on PC, 2k prob don't release game
at all on PC like it is with NHL. Sometimes it's a good laugh to see those super short weird arm/body players, but playing vs long arm 99 is no fun that's for sure.
Less 110-35 games in Rec (Not sure how to fix that tho)
Shot meter settings reset bug.	
Mute bug, dc's, bugs, lags in general. Dc's in Rec/ Park way too often than it should be.
Remove chopper sound that blasts speakers!


New addition that would be nice: 

Option to play for at least 2 Pro Am teams. That would improve Pro Am a lot!    
Hustler badge for those out of bounds loose ball saves. HOF would get you save balls like Rodman did in his playing days. That would be awesome!
Option to high 5 or chest bump your teammate by pressing button after highlight play, like they do in NBA, 
so everyone stop flopping after great plays, but do this instead.
Rec gets way fever badge points than Park. 5 min Park game when u score 15 Points will give similar amount of points than scoring 50 in Rec. I understand reason tho, so we don't have ball hogs in Rec. Maybe that's the best solution to that. But those who play Rec for most of the time get short end of the stick.
Remove, change ratings, VC from player (It was an option in one of the past 2k's)
Balancing passing/ stealing could be improved a lot. I see Playmakers with HOF playmaking badges in Rec with 8 assists and 7 to's all the time. If im PG, I don't pass at all bc i now it's 50/50 that pass will get stolen with all my NT, Dimer, FG, Unpluckable HOF badges, 99 Pass rating. I would think that many players think the same that passing is broken and needs to be improved. A lot of players are not selfish, they know pass/assist ratio is very bad, it's a low success thing to do.

Keep: 
Option to change badges, maybe add option to change Takeover? That was awesome addition this year.
Same Park for 3rd straight year, nah just kidding xD
Option to enable or disable Gatorade boosts. No need to use them in Park, save for Rec, Pro Am.
And at last, keep NBA 2k on PC! Don't do it like they did with NHL.  Appreciate that NBA 2k is on PC!

8012,"All

8013,yasssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
8014,"Another bullshit scripted money grab. Bought the game for career mode, but it turns out 2K is pulling an EA and monetizing absolutely everything. Buy VC or your player will be absolute trash. Buy VC or the scripting will make you lose every single match regardless of your performance. It feels like shot timing absolutely doesn't matter, every shot misses, even if you are alone under the basket with 99% perfect timing. If you're lucky you can get a 10% FG because the game is just that rigged. Meanwhile the CPU makes every single shot it takes, no matter if its from the other side of the court or whether they are 100% smothered by 3 defenders. Absolute piece of shit rigged game that just wants you to spend your money on in-game microtransactions. Lost my faith in 2K."
8015,great game grapics are good
8016,"hello, help me, i cant play my career coz i input incorrect year in my Bday.. how can I fix this??"
8017,🏀
8018,coolll
8019,its a good game
8020,"game is terrible, pay to win, terrible matchmaking on the neighborhood, dribbling and shooting was perfect on 2k19 and didnt need a change but its awful in this game."
8021,riveting
8022,good game
8023,"The fuck is this shit, not even passing where i want to."
8024,it is so dis   gusting that they made you and your teammate so dumb in MC that you have to buy coins in order to actually play the game
8025,Pretty trash all around
8026,Smooth
8027,"Just an overall bad game. Very little thought was put into making online gameplay fun or enjoayble. If you're not playing broken builds who can shoot no matter what, you're constantly waiting for park games to appear or rec games to register. Very poor game."
8028,THIS PLAY IS SO LAG!!!!!! I WAN'T REFUND!
8029,Micro-transactions just to play decent ball.  Runs pretty poorly on my P51. Not worth buying. Just play the bb game you own because it's the same (probably better).
8030,"Always been a fan of NBA 2K series. Enjoy playing it especailly online. Hopefully gameplay gets improved. What should also be improved is that my career TV gets green and all those green screen issues related to the game. 2K should troubleshoot it as even users from different PCs report similar issues and so far no progress has been made. Overall, I would recommend the game as a die hard basketball fan so far 2K maintains a good level which I expect to be picked up even higher with next years' releases."
8031,online is straight garbage. i have a fine pc and i play offline just fine with vsync and 60 fps but when i go online suddenly i get huge lag spikes and i get kicked out of games and get losses because of it not to mention the rare times that i am able to play the delay ruins it. useless
8032,the best!
8033,"Oh cool lets play MyCareer mode! No way this is going to be so much fun, im gonna relive the career of Lebron!! Oh wait, they make you start out as a 60 overall rookie that cant even make half of his freethrows? Oh... They make you play on either Pro, Superstar, Or Hall of Fame?? That makes sense. EZ refund im going back to 2k16"
8034,"Great game, not much different from the previous but why fix whats not broken"
8035,not a bad game.. as always the computer cheats.. otherwise Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen in Ultimate Team makes me happy!! =)
8036,Great Game. Fun to play (:
8037,"MyCareer mode starts off strong, but being unable to max each catagory means u basically can never become a superstar. Also, MyNeighborhood mode basically filled with a bunch of cheaters, all them 88-90+ ratings basically impossible. 

Only recommend for those who like to play single player or couch co-op mode. Multiplayer basically ruined by cheaters."
8038,This game is just not worth it on pc. its way better on a game system. if i could i would get my money back
8039,good game
8040,uhhhh
8041,i love B-ball soooo if you like the sport GET IT
8042,Lots of problems... Finally making an anti-cheat would be fixing one of them ;))
8043,Not a good game. The AI is so bad that even the best players in the leagues would miss wide open shots. I regret getting this game.
8044,"i dont play these games online usually but i hear good things. I play myplayer, myteam, and myleague, all are improved over previous years except myteam. you may have to sink some money into that mode to get any return :/. overall its worth a buy on sale."
8045,it's nice but a little bugy
8046,"Let me just start off by saying that I am well aware of 2K and Take-Two's greedy nature and how this game is essentially a casino disguised as an NBA game. This game gives you ample amounts of opportunities to spend more money than should be necessary thanks to its unfair, time-consuming, and tedious grind. I despise these practices and condemn these two companies.

So why did I buy it?

First, it just so happened to be on sale the very moment I was like ""I hope this is on sale RIGHT NOW otherwise I'm not getting it"". I've been desperate for some sort of NBA game on PC for quite some time. Second I've been desperate for an NBA game on PC for quite a while, and for what it has to offer in its SINGLE-PLAYER DIVISION, I am satisfied. Most single-player and offline features seem to be unaffected and untarnished by 2K and Take-Two's greedy clutches. And for that, I'm grateful.

If you're looking for a good basketball game with good offline features then look no further (as if you really have a choice).

P.S. Tweaking the game sliders help greatly if you ever feel the game feels unbalanced."
8047,It has a really addictive gameplay loop unfortunately the game is plagued by a multitude of issues and micro-transactions. I still think the game is worth it with the current discount IF you play 2k with your friends often.

8050,"I love basketball and it's hard for me not to play this game. My main issue with nba 2k20 is that 2k is one of the most disrespectful and greedy companies on the market.
Whole MyCareer is one big advertisement with short breaks for actual basketball game.
 
You pay for a game, you pay for a VC so you will not have to grind your player for 50 hours, and then they will bring  unskippable ads before the games.

Whole game is clunky, animation based, recycled and full of hackers. 
If you really love basketball you can get it with 70% discount. If you are simply curious, buy yourself something else, or simply give this money to someone in need."

8052,"Unplayable, F*CK 2KTV

In the past games I enjoyed simulating seasons and building a dynasty, trying a little of the MyCareer too, but the Career is boring and its badge-progression is a waste of time. 
The game feels sluggish, animations feel locked into, for example when I am trying to move directly away from a box-out but the player chooses to continue engaging in being boxed-out. 
MyTeam online games won't match you with a competitive team - putting new players against veterans who've amassed 90+ ovr teams."

The worst one so far. You cannot field players outside of their assigned positions in my team, they nerfed icentives in my career, salary...
 
Gameplay is terrible, defending the perimeter is impossible, in triple threat you just get 21 points with the point guard. Jumpshots are easier and contested layups way too difficult. The AIO won't use your screens and won't pass you sometimes in the early clock when you are alone under the basket no matter how many times you spam call for pass. They won't pass you at all unless you call for a pass. New badge system sucks altogether. 

The story is crap, the pampering in the interviews embarrassing. They PR girl in your team shames you for your default suit so you go and spent 10k vc in a new one. You get commercials before games... I could go on. You know why they don't care about cheaters in mp, because this people are cheaters, the want to cheat you out your money and your time.

If you want to see a Lakers team of a bunch of trash and two All-Stars with some to bit Rajon Robin wannabe sidekick then be my guest and buy this game. Or go find sixty buck and shove it where the sun dont shine, it will feel better then playing 2k20 on the pc

8097,"This review is more about the PC community and what your able to play on the servers do to lack of players... :(
I love 2K, been playing since 2k13. Mostly I've played on the PS4, on PC how ever I'd say that it depends on the way you play.
I list the Pros and Cons Below...

Pros:
The Park seems always active
My Team seems always active and Actions are good
(Opinion) Servers seem the same as when I played on the PS4
My League, My Career, are the exact same

Cons:
Jordan Rec center is dead... You wont find a game
I would guess the Cages are dead as well (Never been in them)
Anti up courts are dead besides the 1v1 (Always some one boosting)
2K is pretty greedy when it comes to the packs in MyTeam

What sucks is this could all be fixed on PC with cross play..
I personally loved playing the rec center on PS4 and it sucks that I can never find a game.... But, it really up to you to decide if its worth buying for what you get.

I have a 2080Ti and a very powerful computer overall, all updated drivers.  This shouldn't be on the store for $59.99.  Maybe worth it for $10 if you're very patient and don't mind replaying things you've already done.  Horrible QA."

You win by abusing cheese (exploits) in the game and not by actual tactical setup and ball IQ, the Singleplayer is still customisable to a long extend but has been the same since the dawn of 2k so that is to be expected. Then you have Online which.... I'm not even gonna get into it too much, expect cheaters, laggy lobbies and much more that will ruin your experience.

They will tell you about an investagation that is going on, and they will let you know about. Well.. let me tell you that's bs..in PC there is no real legeds, but in park you will find sometimes 13 of them.. big ass centers with max speed. So save your money and your time, is not worth it. For experience i say this, I post a similar review for 2k19, and look at me here playing this frustrating game. So hope that this review at least change someone mind.. save ur money and play a real game from a real company.. not this shit.

8152,The Graphics are so realistic! Just play with a controller and you'll be good.
8153,"Solid game overall. I hadn't had this title since 2k15 on PC. Definitely runs better than that predicessor. 

MAIN ISSUE: if your internet connection is interrupted, the game lets you play through and complete it, just to be met with a message that says something like 'NOT CONNECTED TO THE SERVER' and you lose all data/progress from the game you just played. This renders your last 30-40 minutes of gameplay NULL and is very annoying. I can't believe this hasn't been fixed. It would seem pretty simple to have data from game just played saved [briefly] onto an offline cache that transfers results of game played back on to your account once you reconnect to the serves. PLEASE FIX THIS!!! THIS IS SIMPLE AND SHOULDN'T STILL BE A PROBLEM!!! I've only had this game for a week and it's already happened to me 5 TIMES. 

Other than that, the MyCareer is a little better. I like some of the development they've done, but it also seems like you cap out on attributes quickly. It's like you start as a certain type of player and are inevitably going to be stuck in whatever build throughout (ie shooter, defensive, playmaker). Yes, you can improve your weakpoints, but not very much (from what I can see).

MyTeam is GREAT. So many different player cards and amassed game modes inside of it.

Again, overall a solid game, but 2K needs to improve on some things I feel are quite remedial to make the game feel whole."

The 2K support is incompetents and not flexible. Skill boosts are cross-account, for a mysterious reason the gatorate boosts are not. Contacted support and their reply: ""I am sorry about this, would you mind if I transferred this chat to my colleague as I am having some technical difficulties?"".

8173,"It's better wasting time on something which is part of yourself already.   I started play basketball when I was little and I AM a basketball fan but I could never play good, because I'm not tall and strong as my pals but I think of myself quick anyway. 

When I was in junior high, I spent my pocketmoney, and well, even some part of dinner money on purchasing basketball magazine and newspaper. The magazine launched out half monthly and the newspaper came out every Tuesday and Thursday but it's cheaper than magazine. It was from those juicy magazines that I started to obsessed with the trivia and gossip of NBA player. T-mac is my favourite, because he played with Yao Ming in Houston Rockets and he played gracefully. 

I started to play this 2k series last year (although I've acknowledged this game more than ten years ago). But I'll still need to buy a wireless controller for this game( I am using machanical keyboard currently which is good enough but...).  My team includes Dirk,Garnett,T-mac,Thompson and Barros, all are build-in player card which takes no money. This team is good enough to win a game for even ALL-STAR level, ignoring my bad keyboard operating skills.  I switch to Chinese version of  commentary(I'm Chinese) and it is sometimes very amusing, well at more time, they are very mean. The only excuse I allowing myself investing time on this game is that I AM a basketball fan. 

If I could found a way to cope with the unstable shooting rate, I will make t-mac get over 30 points in every game.

As a person that never would buy vc in game, I GRINDED to get to a mere 90 overall, I was still getting my ass handed to me by hackers that would kick me out of my spot. The game is actually promising in the beginning, with a great my story. But once you enter the league, there really is a less then appealing amount of content. I bought this game with my friends, and when you cant play a neighborhood without having one of you lag out, or getting 21-0 every time, it is genuinely no fun. Do not buy this game. I would genuinly reccomend NBA live over this garbage, and that's saying a lot because 2k has been THE GAME for so long."

Edit: After contacting 2k the only thing they could tell me was to turn on V sync and cap the frames at 60. Really 2k? This game is terribly optimized for PC. I did some digging and i found out you have to Alt Tab (for anyone else experiencing this issue). Also, Half of the Stupid weekly workout drills are bugged and don't function right. Park play is a joke with players hacking, so good luck there. For every step forward 2k takes with gameplay, there's multiple backwards steps that make the game unenjoyable."
8193,I like this game
8194,"I really dont understand the hate about the game, regarding the gameplay or the team in mycareer. Ok the miss shots some time, so do your oppnents. You just have to find openings. And in the beginning, you also dont have great team chemistry. So you gotta work with your team, get good ratings, do all the drills, get your badges. If you make 1K VC (A Rating) a Game, just do ten games and then start progressing.  

Know your strengths. Know your jump shots. Call plays. Call screens. Get your openings. 

First season. 21 Ws, 4Ls. 

Im kinda hooked. 

But to be fair. 
The Microtransaction struggle is real, if you start with no VC. Best way to start is, get the Legend Edition on sale. Check a good build before your start and use your starting VC wisely."

8204,"MyTeam progression system seems really fun in terms of evolution cards and progressing with new rewards from challenges as well as buying more cards. Sadly this shit game has no matchmaking system that is fair for players. For example, new to the game and want to try to get some rewards online? Think again dawg you getting matched with all Galaxy Opal squad good luck. Don't get me started on how broken that is, even if they are brain dead they can juke you so fast and shoot 3's from anywhere green.

As well as matchmaking being a shit show, online in itself is a shit show. I have not played a game without experiencing input lag or any other bullshit such as connection issues. Made me really wonder if my internet was bad but to realize this is a common thing that has been happening since many 2k games ago.

If you want to play single player this game is pretty good for what it offers, faster progression is what I heard in myCareer compared to other 2k's. As well as that like I said myTeam is fun to play even if I have to resort to single player only. If I listened to everyones baby mama to not buy this game from the start I wouldn't but I bought it so no going back chilling with single player isn't bad.

Crashfest 2k20. I have sadly bought this game almost religiously the last 6 years and this years version takes the cake for the worst version yet. Want to check out a player on your roster while using MyLeague? You can't because that crashes the game 75% of the time. Want to edit a draft class? Wrong again, I crash the game too. Want to pull your hair out because your game you just bought doesn't work? 2k has your back on this one."

8211,"2k games were always a bunch of fun over the years even though they micro transactions got more and more.
the graphics are ok, they didnt change much over the last few years. But the gameplay.......
Starting with the cpu, changing the difficulty makes no big difference except that shots go in much less and are genral harder to hit, and your teammates are extremly bad even if they are stars irl; but its playable and can be fun if you get used to it. But the mp is just terrible, besides forcing people to spend many hundred bucks to get a team good enough to have a little chance against other online. Also the matchmaking is shit as hell, me spending not 100 of bucks having a decent time getting a enemy with 10 opals. And if that would be the only thing. The servers are so freakin bad lagging always just a little, to the point you lose connection and get a loss in unlimited. With the bad connection it is most of the time pure chance wether you hit the shit or miss, combined with the super bad programming that sometimes hard covered shots go in and wide open not. If you play against the cpu it can be a bit of fun, but overall the game is just a bold joke"

And what the fuck is up with the shit as freethrows??? Are all rookies fucking brick shiters?? And don't get me started on the rookie animations. A fucking grandma can move better than those shit animations. And of course, the worst, all the fucking ads and boring as replays of best assist etc... WORST GAME EVER.

8236,"idk if you want to get this game on pc, if you have a ps4 or xbox, get it there, so much lag, hackers, dead lobbies, no rec, no pro am, no ante up or anything but the thing that pisses me off the most is how much hackers there are on pc this is worth at least 2 dollars, if not 1"

8242,"Look, I could come at this from several different angles, but lets start here.  Have you played and if so do you enjoy NBA 2K20, or failing that, NBA 2K19.  If the answer is no, then the choice here is fairly simple, do not buy it.  Assuming you do enjoy or have enjoyed the NBA 2K series within the last two years or so, e.g., on console, then there is a lot to like here.  Assuming you are brand new to the franchise, I would say that whether this is a good game for you or not will turn heavily upon how much you loath micro transactions (or are willing to work around them) and how much you appreciate a sim type play style versus an arcade play style.  This year in particular tends much more heavily toward the sim side of that dynamic.  Micro transactions are a problem, but especially in MyCareer they can be avoided or at least mitigated in large part.   Using myself as an example, I buy a bit of VC at start of every season to ease the first grind (much like an MMO), then no more.  This isn't strictly necessary but your life will suck much less, because, make no mistake, park in 2K is a basketballl MMO.  Anyway, I suspect the main audience here is people who either currently play 2K or have recently on console and are interested in playing it on PC.  To that person I say this: The online community is much more vibrant than years past.  Predictably, game runs well on good good hardware, i.e., it will feel much more smooth if you have the right hardware."
8243,i love it
8244,it a good and fun game

8255,"Just dont get it. I wish I still had the $60 dollars I spent. After about a 5 or 6 game win streak in my Career, your next game will automatically be scripted for the other team to win. My player is averaging fucking 70 points a game and yet every 5 or 6 games i have to restart multiple times because the game mechanics will blatantly be boosted for the other team and nerfed for you. All of the sudden your teammates will stop playing defense, the center on the other team inherits the block rate of fucking manute bol and any third-string player can drain consecutive threes regardless of defense. 


Symptoms of a scripted game................ 

1. your player runs right past the person your defending.
 2. Unable to make shots even with minimal defense.
 3. CPU getting consistant offensive rebounds. Usually after a well defended three 
4. CPU scoring on 80% of possesions
5. your teammates unable to defend their man
6. CPU ability to score over well defended shots.
7. CPU ridiculous help defense
8. CPU ignoring player physics, going through my arm for a shot etc. 

This happens for all difficulties on MyCareer

I maintain my playstyle consistantly throughout games and usually by the end of the first im up 25, yet every couple games, whether it be the lakers or the fucking knicks, i cannot maintain a lead above 5, and the other team immediately goes on a 20-0 run as soon as im subbed out. 

If you still decide to buy this game some advice.

1. After you go on a win streak for 5 or 6 games immediately restart your next game once
2. During first round playoff games- restart twice
3. for conference finals on-wards restart 3 times
4. Dont play online, your buddies at Taketwo Interactive have offered up an extremely immersive experience this year where hackers are unregulated and players with 9 foot fucking arms run rampant in servers. If your lucky sometimes you get to catch a 100ft player.


I know its bad luck to root for EA, but next year I hope NBA live gets their shit together and comes back because honestly if they made even a mediocre game they would wipe the floor with 2k. The fan-base is sick and tired of their shit."

8267,"Review is for My Park/Neighborhood: Playing single player is fine, but take this to the neighborhood and you're met with tons of hackers and low IQ players. A majority of the time your teammates will hog the ball regardless of how bad they are playing and continue to do so until they lose you game. You have to pay money to get to a higher level without insanely boring single player grinding.... None of the higher level players will play with anyone below level 85 or so.... I can understand not wanting to play with a level 75 or lower, but 80+? Come on man... I've played with lower level players that are clearly better than some higher level players. Some won't even play with people below lvl 90. Special players get the ability to ""boot"" you out of the queue to join a game which is absolutely nuts and totally unfair. Especially when you've been waiting a bit to get into a game and as it's about to start, some idiot boots you out and takes your spot... what kind of idiot thought this was a good idea? Oh yeah, the people who want a lot of these guys to feel special and important so they spend more money on the game... those idiots. The same ones who thought a casino was a good idea. What I hate the most is you are met with this INSANELY, obnoxiously loud helicopter sound the covers up every bit of sound in the game world and practically blows your ear drums out every time a Superstar joins. It's absolutely insane that anyone thought this was a good idea or even thought the sound of the helicopter should literally almost clip your speakers every time someone comes in. And to make matters worse, most of these people are hackers. If 2K actually put effort into making this game mode a good experience, it could actually be one of the best online sports games there is. But nah, lets just cater to pay2win players and put minimal effort into creating the game mode. Don't buy this game for My Park gameplay, and next year make sure you read up on how it works before you buy it. Always wait for the inevitable sale the game has every year as well... unless they do amazing work on a game, I always wait until the price drops to at least $20 and even that is too much. They used to do sales on the game for $8, but not really any more. Do not buy."
8268,It's good.
8269,iiiiiiiiiiiiiittttttttttttttssssssssss perfect for basketball fans.
8270,"A huge mess, Yes a good basketball game just not on pc yet. They dont care about pc. Servers are weird, people hack and 2k does nothing about it, the optimization for pc is just worse than consoles. Well its been some years now. I hope 1 day they notice the pc community."
8271,ITS FUN AND PC 2K IS BETTER
8272,great game play
8273,wdadasda
8274,"As someone who rarely plays 2K games (and solely plays 2k for MyCareer), after five hours I can tell you many reasons NOT to buy the game:

1) Story is NOT great, it's a short introduction to the game, and doesn't seem to come back up.
2) Buggy AF. I have a UHD monitor and can support the game above 1920x1080 and 60Hz. Game actually tells you not to do this. I tried and game bugs. Even without changing things in the menu I have to constantly alt+tab to get menus to prompt, continue playing, etc.
3) Same sh*t, different day. If you're looking for a good NBA experience, I'd say look for older 2K games. This game is just another money grab."
8275,"This game has had bugs since day 1. 2k doesn't fix these bugs, which aren't minor and include the game freezing in the middle of every MyPlayer game, and just kind of brushes off help requests."

8297,"If you are a new player and think you want to try this game out, don't. It is impossible to make a shot online unless you research the crap out of it, get the same shot and build as every other online shooter, and then pour hours and money into the game to get your player good. This is a commitment unless you hack the game, in which 2K neglects the PC community so there's really no punishment. I've played 2K since 2k9 and this is by far the worst game play and hardest on new players. The attributes mean nothing and badges are received by game play so you're at a disadvantage right from the jump. If you want to play online, you have to play an entire season offline just to stand a chance, which, unless you want to spend an entire month doing nothing else but playing offline 2k, this game is a no go."
8298,good

Once he had enough he put me in a screen freeze, where I could not get out of."

8316,YO THIS GAME NOT THAT BAD PEOPLE TRIPPEN
8317,"NBA 2K is a big enough game with enough different features and modes that it should warrant separate reviews for the separate modes. Personally, I mainly play MyCareer and MyGM. I'll keep this short. If you play MyCareer, this game is fine. If you spend more time in MyGM, stick to 2k19."
8318,good overall
8319,[
8320,"I see a lot on how people say its trash and you have to hack to be good i don""t agree i think this game is fun and its fun to grind your way up and just play with friends"
8321,"Gucci if you can grind it out baby
"
8322,This game is so damn buggy. It sucks because i am a huge fan of 2K but this game crashes randomly and also in my player career you have to Alt- Ctrl x 3 to get the simulator to come up which would be no big if the game would not stop crashing randomly.
8323,"It's a good game of basketball with very nice graphics and good gameplay. My negative review goes for the greedy approach as everything is depending on virtual currency. Not only the looks but as well the development of your player and, in the end, the joy you take from the game.
The neighborhood is full of courts with almost maxed players that almost always win and with whom you basically never have a chance. Your partners turn many times into AI players as real players quit in the middle of the game. It could have courts with max levels (up to 80, up to 90 and 90+). That would make it work and would be fairer and more enjoyable.
Seems like tho they just don’t want you to spend on vc… a frustrated player is bound to spend more money.
Probably will not continue with the 2k games if their approach will continue to be money oriented.

Additional note:  Sometimes the AI is just set to make you loose. Your teamplayers just screw everything, miss the most simple shots and the your opponnent scores against any opposition or just go with a crazy 3pts percentage. So frustrating."

8397,"This game has 2 major problems: bugs and VC.

I predominantly play MyLeague and MyCareer:
- MyLeague: buggy as hell. Game crashes if you customize a league with historic draft classes or expansion teams. Also, this mode has not had a major upgrade since 2k16. It still has the same bugs and glitches as back then. You should think that they could allocate some of the millions of dollars raked in with MyTeam to improving MyLeague. But alas.
- MyCareer: the grindiest grindfest of all time. I never paid one cent on VC, but grass grows faster than my player progresses. Horrible storyline, stupid product placements (Beats party, Gatorade galore). I DON'T WANT TO WATCH 2KTV.

On top of this, I locked the refreshrate at 60hz, but when I start the game there is a 50-50 chance the game starts with an unlocked framerate. This causes major stuttering (no G-Sync monitor) during gameplay. Also, when I exit the game, my monitor acts weird, locking at 120hz in stead of the regular 144hz. 

The gameplay is actually very good, the in game commentary is amazing, as well is the matchday presentation. The graphics don't seem to have been upgraded since 2k14/15. Every year is a more lackluster rendition with the sole purpose of raking in more money with the stupid universe-platinum-kosmos-iridium prime Rik Smits opal cards."

Commentary doesnt work, graphics is the same for few years but it lack smoothness. I am dissapointed, 2K was like a beacon on the PC sports field. But now it looks like NBA monopoly withou passion, just new number behind K letter, new rosters. But it lost passion, it lost the show and beauty of basketball. RIP NBA game..."

The stupid thing is the game will support it, as you can play vs CPU at 60+fps, but if you want a friendly match with friends or anyone else, you can forget that.

8450,LOVE IT!!!!
8451,nothing has really changed when it comes to gameplay. shooting is trash. constantly have to get perfect shot when shooting for shots to go in even if the player has a high shoot rating. movement of players is so slow.  its a grand to level up your mycareer player unless you spend real money to get credits. last nba game i played was 2016. thought game would have gotten better but its the same. regret spending the money and the time on this game.
8452,fun
8453,good
8454,its i bit challenging at first u know with the whole vc issue and having enough to get a player stats to be even good enough to play at first but as u play gets better.
8455,"Layered with micro transactions across every activity you do. You want to upgrade your career character? VC! You want to get any, clothes, shoes, in game animations? VC! 

The grind to upgrade your character is ridiculous because you earn VC so slowly compared to how fast you can upgrade. Essentially, if you want to start a new Character and get them to around 85 Overall within 10 hours without glitches, be prepared to pay another $80. This game also seemingly (played through play offs 6 times now) purposely changes the way the in game play happens in the playoffs/finals with players seemingly gaining massive stat bonuses behind the scenes ruining how it feels. 

Unfortunately, loving the NBA drives people to continue playing."
8456,"What is this fucking shit really, luckily got this off a bundle wouldn't pay full price on this bullshit of a game. the gameplay is so sluggish its like a fucking atari game on how it plays how come the console verison isn't this bad oh thats right 2k just rush this port for a quick cash in. god what happen to 2k first you ruin the wwe series by letting go the best wrestling developers in the industry now this shit, who knows whats going on behind the scenes with your company but it must be whole lot of bullshit."
8457,Classic NBA 2K game decent park. can mess with you in animations but thats the usual.
8458,SO FUN
8459,"I only play offline. So I haven't been minding the games previously to this one. 

TLDR: It's bad. I've been playing NBA 2K for awhile now and this will probably be the last time I buy one until some serious changes happen. I remember some of these things from the previous ones, but not bad enough for it to really affect the games. 20 though, it's just frustrating. Better off just playing 2K17.

First thing is the animation.. You're basically no longer playing, almost just guiding players around (NBA Simulator 2020). Just hit a three, trying to make comeback in a game, not going to happen because my player is going to do some stupid animations instead of getting back on defense and that player's guy just scored a easy bucket on the other side. 

Second thing is switching between players. Guy has you beat so you want to switch to another player to help? You can, but for some reason there is a delay or cooldown for switching player. So the guy you just switched to just stands there for a split second as the opponent goes right by.

Third thing is the AI. You're always playing a couple guys down. Similar example from above but you try to fight this problem by hoping that your AI teammate will help. Nope, in fact, sometimes they'll run away from the guy driving the basket. So your center will decided to cover the opponents center in the corner, when they have a F in three point shooting.

Fourth thing is the minor defense is enough to make the best players miss. You'll get a mismatch with a point guard on your center, so you take inside. Put up a pretty decent shot and miss. That's fine, everyone misses. Since the shorter point guard is on you, you get your miss pretty easily and try to put it back up again. Miss again.. And again until everyone has converged on the basket and you no longer get the rebound. 

Fifth is driving to the basket with a guy that can dunk on anyone, then decides to crazy ass layup which then slows him down (back to the animations) and he ends up missing or getting swatted. I get sometimes, you have to adjust when you have some contact, but when the guy is behind you and you're doing this, doesn't make sense. Sometimes they will even just try a 2ft jump shot, which ends very poorly.

Sixth, is passing while in mid shot.. Just don't. It's a turnover waiting to happen. You can have an awesome playmaker with great passing abilities, drive to the basket, draw in some other players, start the layup process and see a man open in the corner. Ball goes flying WAY off from where the guy stands.

The last one that I can currently thinking of is MyLeague and the draft. I like to dream about bringing the Sonics back and simulate an expansion team in the offseason. During the draft there duplicate players of Ja, Zion, and RJ with the same exact stats, but with different names.

Edit: Simulating with MyTeam and MyGM still fun."

8464,its good
8465,"my career is awesome
"
8466,"kinda shite but if you like basketball games then yeah, it's better than NBA Live"
8467,"I really don't know what they were thinking with the MyCareer in this game.  It starts off really strong, with the training camps, combine, draft prep, summer league, etc.  Those are all absolutely fantastic, and it really does feel like you're involved in the sport when you're playing them, to a level of immersion that no other game has ever achieved for me, regardless of genre.  I really cannot speak too highly about how well the whole intro section to the game is.

Then when you get into the season... it just all falls apart.

First off, your teammates absolutely suck, no matter what.  My created player is on the Rockets with Harden and Westbrook, and when I say these men miss layups, I mean they miss LAYUPS.  Wide open elbow shots, top of the key, in the paint, doesn't matter, they'll miss almost every time.  These are a couple of some of the most phenomenal guards in the game right now, but in MyCareer, they play like they barely made the cut for JV.  I haven't even seen Westbrook go for a single dunk.  WESTBROOK.  The man that flies over people on the regular and absolutely tears through interior defenders.  He plays like he has a 20"" vertical in MyCareer.

Secondly, if you ever try to act on your court awareness, like playing effective off-ball interior defense, you will get blamed every single time something bad happens.  Someone else's man scores?  That's your defensive breakdown.  Throw the ball to your teammate off a pick and roll and he butterfingers it, or reaches the wrong direction?  That's your turnover.  Miss a wide open elbow shot (which will happen a LOT)?  Bad shot selection.  Oh look, now you're benched again, because somehow every bad thing that happens is your fault.

And good luck ever sinking a layup as a rookie.  If an opponent is within 5 feet of you, you'll throw up a brick, regardless of the shot or timing, no questions asked.  And if you're driving, the moment a defender comes within that same distance, your player will start riding up against him instead of just keeping his line, as if he wants to be stopped.

Also, your player is barely capable of executing a crossover, and he is as slow as a slug.  You literally cannot dribble under pressure for more than 2 seconds without either turning over or having to pick up the ball.

The free throws are totally rigged too as a rookie.  I've missed PERFECT RELEASE free throws and my guy has a 70 free throw rating as a rookie.

And then, even as a point guard, with plenty of assists and some good baskets, your team will still frequently ignore your pass calls even at your most opportune moments, which drops your team chemistry, causing your team to play even worse.  This means that it's just better for you to ball hog and keep setting screens until something happens, because without your heroism, your team won't score.

MyCareer mode just boils down to you having to play really selfishly.  On offense, ball hog and just call for constant screens.  On defense, stay right up against your man and never trying to play the support role.  And the best part is, you'll be having to one-man-army your way to victory with your starting ~60-65 rating.  And leveling up your character takes forever.

It's just really clear that you're supposed to purchase in-game currency and use that currency to blast your player level up as soon as possible.  The game is entirely focused on you being the star of the show, and you simply can't do that unless you have high stats.

Terrible.  Just terrible."

8474,The fact that nothing is done to combat the rampant cheating and how easy it is to cheat shows 2k just don't care anymore. Oh wait they haven't cared in years.
8475,"So I had NBA 2K18 and liked it.. would have given it a solid 4/5 stars... this seems very... EA to me.  The menus are less responsive (which means more frustrating), more confusing (more frustrating), less detailed (more ugly?), feel like they're part of the background (more confusing)...  It just seems like they took a overly flashy design already and just threw a bucket of paint on it and called it art...  This game only has one UI element, the menu system...  Geeze, get it right...

Also, it makes the game play so... frustrating...  There are really only a few modes... quick play, playoffs, player career, coach/GM career... and thats it... but they've given them names that you have to think ""which one does what again?"".  Nothing about this game is self-evident...

Also, since 2k18 they've changed the controls a lot.  I no longer know how to call plays, still dont know even though I pressed every button on a Xbox controller, none of them brought up a menu where I could pick plays...

Lastly, it brought in this ""new"" action points system in the GM mode, which is cool... GM's dont have unlimited time in the real world... but it starts out with 1 point per day, and just to adjust your starting lineup it cost a point per move...  That's pretty stupid...

Anyways, the game is going to get a 2/5 from me.  It is a basketball game, but... It lacks in almost every other way...  I'll probably get a roster mod for 2k18 and just use it."

8490,"Scumbag developers.
The business practices employed in this game should be illegal. This game is basically a wallet emptying casino. 
You pay full price for the game, yet you CANNOT upgrade your player to a usable level without using this virtual currency. 
Grinding to get to an acceptable level would take you years. 
It is designed to infuriate you, so you open your wallet and purchase some VC from these scumbag fuck head cunt knuckles. This should be outlawed.
The accessories and vanity items are also so outrageously priced, that trying to obtain them whilst also trying to upgrade your player stats to something that does not resemble a talking potato is impossible.

8492,"Before I got this game, I didn't have much of an interest in basketball, and upon writing this review, I still don't.
However, out of the many sports that there are, this has quickly become one of the more enjoyable ones for me to watch, even though I don't seek out and watch any of the games, some of the moments are quite funny.
While the game has some flaws, like the terrible servers on PC, the times that you get fouls called on you for ridiculous reasons, and the fact that for whatever reason when you go against the Brooklyn Nets they suddenly become EXTREMELY OVERPOWERED and never seem to miss, the game's perks greatly outweigh the downfalls.
While the people in the background look like they've been made on MS Paint, the players and important characters look exactly how you would expect them to in real life.
So far, I have barely played MyTeam and have pretty much only been playing MyCareer, and even though I know that MyTeam is where the developers put most of their effort into, I would still give this a great review."

8507,"I've been playing NBA 2K games since 2010... they progressively get more obnoxious with micro transactions. I got this for $20 in a Humble Bundle and don't even think it's worth that. I usually stick to MyPlayer mode, but they now make you so terribly bad off the rip that you're on the level of about an 8th grade basketball player in the NBA. I feel like I have rocks in my shoes. Plus, earning VC is staggeringly slow. This game has turned into such a racket for getting people to spend money, it's disgusting. Two thumbs down, I give up on these games - not worth more than $10."
8508,"Honestly, this is the worst version of the game in years. The players have lead feet, playing defense is ridiculously difficult to the point where it's broken, and it seems like there's no input when you try and complete some actions. I'd rather go back to any of the other games over the last 5 years than play this one. What's happening at 2K Sports/VC that they're putting out such bad games recently?"
8509,Broken and unfinished. Worst sports game I've played in long time.

8514,"A shit game, so so so bad, It's more better nba 2k14, A LOT, how it's possible? Halftime in 30 fps IN 2020 ffs. Players hit the ball with the head, because they don't have hands for the ball and they play football not basketball. It's just bad, don't buy it, just don't. Why this game isn't $1 ? Who the fck give $50 ??? I don't want to give hate, but I have to. These games are just for money, don't even care about players, about NBA players, about nothing. They see just in front, like pigs. NBA 2k21 will have Kobe on him, just to make emotion and just to make sure you will buy it. They profit this real drama, to make money. BAD GAME!"
8515,"Have been playing this series since 2K7 on my original XBOX. Despite a lot of development put into this game through the years the fun factor has decreased. The game looks better than ever, lots of new game modes, teams, commentary but the essential gameplay has stagnated from year to year.

The games physics engine takes away much of the control from the player which makes many basketball situations unrealistic. Players speed up 200% at times to get to their positions, jump out of nowhere to intercept passes, player get slowed down when they are ahead on a fast break. 

Most frustrating are lock-in animatsions. They ruin the whole feel of the game. Many times you just watch an animation that does not make sense in the current scenario. Like passes to players cutting to the basket. Players stop abruptly and don't continue with the motion they were. This kills many passing for an open basket scenarios . 

Most animations are way too slow, even if you get your defender in the air you can't ever get enough separation to have a clean shot. It is like there is some kind of rubber band between you and the defender.  

Players miss way too many open baskets when going  for a layup. This happens a lot to great finishers who go for a layup with noone directly between the ball and the basket.

The main attraction of the NBA are its superstars but in the game you can't actually feel that sensation. You can't make hero plays with them like you used to. The superstar hardly ever make the difficult shots that they are supposed to. Its like the only way utilize them is in the flow of the offense. Players like Durant, Harden or cannot be effectively guarded by a single player. If durant has 5 inces on the defender he should easily be able to score on him. All the advantages that those superstar have are taken away. You don't get the satisfaction in isolation plays, since every defender can guard you superstar. I want to be able to play with supertars like they are superstars. 

I remember how in NBA 2k7 i could take Kobe and unless i messed up the release or was double teamed i could score consistently, i could even hit very difficult shots. Now every time a defender is near you it is very hard to hit a shot. Great players make tough shots from time to time, but now they even miss open shots way too often. I crunch time forget about getting a bucket with your superstar in a one on one situation. 

In summary, the gameplay just feels too scripted and is not that much anymore.

I don't spend money on micro-transactions and have still had fun with playing the MyTeam and MyCareer modes. Its frustrating at times, but the game is suppose to be challanging.

I also bought this game for a lot less than its advertised for, I would say that this is a good buy at 20 bucks."

8530,"is cool, a lot of modes which are real money supported though"
8531,everything
8532,"I cannot recommend this game. I bought it because I have a team in a simulated league (it began as something for people who missed sports during quarantine to do and watch) and I wanted to be able to see how it works and I sometimes got the itch to play after watching the games. 

My experience was not what I thought it would be. I was looking forward to building a team but the progress in MyTeam is way too slow unless you spend some money, which is obviously what the devs are aiming for. I realize that I'm only 17 hours in but I don't see myself leveling the current easy-to-get players I've got to anything approaching decent within the next 100 hours, let alone get any awesome ones I'm dying to play. Moreover, you can't even invite your friend via remote play or have a friend locally participate. That would make the grinding more fun and that's what I love. I'd get most of my fun from leveling players and building a roster with my friend/s. I like co-op games and this would be my mode of choice.

Then there's the MyCareer mode. I've got a monster of a rig with a monitor to match. In order to get the ""simulate to my next appearance"" to work I've got to set the game to V-sync on and 60hz instead of 144. That's a bug that should have been fixed a long time ago as I'd like to be able to play the game as smooth and beautiful as my setup allows.

I might play a game or two when I'm bored but I won't be spending much time in this game which means that it doesn't constitute value for money in my book as it's quite expensive."
8533,"good
"
8534,"The game is great, when you can get it to work. I made a mycareer player, played for a while and decided that I'd like a different style of player. Well, that's when 2k20 has an issue. Some server error that'snotaserver error prevents me from doing this. After a few google searches, I see that my error is widespread and since this bug has been continually a problem since at least january of2019, that 2k sports doesn't care. 0/10 would not recommend. Not until 2ksports decides to actually fix their product."

8594,"Unplayable garbage.  As soon as the short MyCareer story starts, starting games will either crash to desktop or will not allow you to simulate to your next appearance (instead playing the entire game in SLOW MOTION).  This series keeps getting worse"
8595,Worst game ever
8596,"Its hard to recommend this game because it kinda does suck but my league is fun enough, cant play for more than like 15 years though because everyone just demands a max contract and is a 90 ovr. my career is also not bad, i think its pretty fun but gets boring VERY fast. Overall it is nothing more than a chill game to play while watching youtube or listening to music.... Thats how i play it. (P.S online sucks dont expect anything good to do with ANYTHING online)
"
8597,Got it for $15. My career is plenty fun and worth it. My GM mode is also great. As long as you don't give into the money grab the game isn't half bad.
8598,irrelevant as fuck bruh
8599,"I only play Mycareer, so this game is okay."
8600,this game is fun and adiciting
8601,yao ming
8602,It's fun!
8603,"Have enjoyed NBA games since highschool especially ps2 nba live 03/06.
2K20 hasn't been disappointing at all and I'm having great fun playing! The mixed reviews are conflicting to say the least but if your an early 90's born and you grew up with card games too its a real game and a half. 
Definitely worth a buy! Plus your phone app contributes which is great when your out and wana jam out with ya clam out!"
8604,"Game is okay, except for the tedious grind that any legitimate players have to go through, only to get stomped by the 80-90% of people who are hacking in the park. It is an absolute joke how infested the PC park is with cheats and 2k doesn't give an ish about it."
8605,is a good game
8606,One of the Most or not The Most Greatest Money Grabbing Game of All Time. FIRE RONNIE2K
8607,this game is hot garbage.
8608,"32:9 Rez 3840x1080 @ 144hz with high framerates
That's why you play this on PC

ignoring all the money nonsense tied to this game"
8609,Gameplay itself is pretty nice but the game has glitches and bugs way too often. For a $60 game that also does micro transactions; you would think they wouldn't have this issue with the amount of money they should be receiving. It is also a copy paste game of last years 2k with a very slight change.
8610,"Constant and sudden crashes.  Middle of the second half and bam, desktop.  Game over.  Also I found MyCareer seriously lacking.  and wtf, not even a way to play it offline?  Come on 2k, get it together.  I got this as part of a $20 humble bundle deal with like, 15 other games, and it still wasn't worth it."
8611,its pretty fun and wilt champerlain has some pretty neato reato socks
8612,Love it
8613,The game is dynamic and has a well built story line. Unfortunately some of the transitional videos only show as green screens
8614,"This game is almost the same as 2k19... Same Park, mechanics, same greedy Myteam mechanics, Pay2Win...AI cheating when you are playing against them no way to get steal no way to get rebound as AI have boosts to get it and of course don't forget about players from opposing team who are never missing a shot and getting 20+ greens while your team is struggling from open position and yeahh about stuff in the game... to get something you have two options #1 grind till you die or #2 buy it for milions... I hate it even more because I love basketball and it is only option to play it as EA is still far behind :( :( I Hope that someday it will change..."
8615,"Crashing repeatedly since the April 7th patch. Seriously? With how much money this game must bring in? Fix the servers please.

Edit on 04/28: Servers still crashing, not as frequently. Also, the gatorade discounts in this game don't work. It never has. If the discounts aren't going to be given, don't offer them in the first place. Just makes 2k seem like they're being shady."
8616,"7/10. I personally prefer offline gameplay, theres a ton of hacking and stuff on PC servers, and the servers are just crap in general. The offline stuff is fun just playing basketball. But honestly unless you REALLY want to get 2K20 I don't recommend it. But to me its pretty fun and I've had a pretty good time playing."
8617,very good game. i dont use microtransactions.
8618,"poor physics and mechanism
slow gameplay"
8619,yes
8620,really awesome to play
8621,"So I mostly play MyCareer,so my review is strictly based on that gamemode

Horrible AI for teammates,too many cut scenes at the beginning (I'm sure there is more cut scenes then gameplay until you get drafted),and it's a horrible grind for VC and badges (which I don't mind,getting better shouldn't be easy but 2k does it to push VC and boosts on you).
"
8622,"MyLeague customization is utterly broken, and the rest of the game is rather shallow imo.  I wish the devs would actually work at fixing the broken things in the game, rather than shove more 'rare cards' down the pipe.  I'd like to make a full league of unique teams without getting errors after team 6 or 7.  Doesn't seem like that should be very difficult.

As for the rest of the game, it's very okay.  The gameplay itself feels like it's stagnated since 14 or so, which is disappointing.  Not really worth the full price."

8633,"Only play this game if you need a basketball fix. I found the deluxe version on New Egg for 25 bucks and am still extremely underwhelmed. Online play is almost nonexistent at this point. Single player modes like myplayer cannot allow for video settings over 60 hz without errors happening on screen. But if you keep these settings for online play your player is lagging behind. So with that in mind it seems like 144 hz only works for online play? On top of this, I could not find any good wikis or solid sources of information on how to make solid my player builds. Going to youtube and watching a bunch of trial and error builds is not sufficient enough regarding how much VC is required to make a player over 80-85 overall. Only play this game if you really need a basketball fix.

On top of this, it could be that I just suck, but the teammate AI for myplayer is even worse than ever now relying on you more than ever."
8634,zzzzzz
8635,This game is dog shit.
8636,"This game, like most sports games, is utter garbage if you're looking for a game to invest a large portion of time into. Given that everyone knows this, they have made the game revolve around micro-transactions to stabilize their income rate (you probably knew this too). Save yourself the inevitable rage that will result from playing this worthless, garbage-game for more than 10 hours. I have to STRONGLY advise you against purchasing this copy/paste, low-effort, embarrassing, and enraging piece of addictive garbage. I would say this game has significantly worsened my mental state and contributed to the debilitating anger issues I have today. There is, as unfortunate as it is, no better basketball game, because god hates gamers who like basketball. If you invest hours upon hours like I have (been playing religiously since 2k16), you will find that the game does not reward, and rather, punishes by matching with noobs, who still have 50/50 chance of beating you due to the games inability to register skill and make it matter. The MyTeam platform is especially pathetic in that you cannot beat anyone unless you invest a minimum of $100, and even then you'll often lose to 12-year-olds who have spent thousands of their parent's money to acquire a ""god-squad"" that is virtually unbeatable. I have invested, as of now, 751 hours into this garbage. I hate myself for it and I've invested far more time into other games and didn't regret it as they were consistently enjoyable, as opposed to this RUBBISH. I genuinely wish death upon all the money-hungry head-developers, who have been using what is essentially gambling to trick children into wasting endless amounts of time and money. I could go on and on about how horrible this franchise is. I am disgusted. I am angry. Never before have I been more enraged by a piece of media than this. PLEASE DO NOT BUY! PLEASE! I beg of you! If you are considering it, STOP considering it! Go buy something fulfilling. I know you may like basketball, but this isn't basketball. This is VIRTUAL HELL!"
8637,keep getting different kinds of errors
8638,doodoo
8639,pretty fye
8640,"Fun way to get back into the NBA, but the game is riddled with micro-transactions, ads, and requires a ridiculous amount of time to improve your player. Physics feel a bit choppy, somehow even less realistic than 2k15 or before. Wouldn't recommend unless you can get it for $20 or less."
8641,Cool fun game before nap time.
8642,Loads of fun

8647,"poor server, bugs character in mycareer just like hacks. please do smthing about the server, thanks"

8651,What choice do you have?
8652,there all off-baller no one really play DEFENSE.Only use cpu to deal with fuck and suck community.
8653,"I only play for MyCareer, and while in the past the microtransactions haven't bothered me enough to ruin the experience, this year was the tipping point. Additionally, I can't even play at this point, as the game is stuck at 0% updating and none of the fixes I've found online worked."

8679,Yes it is very good
8680,"has it flaws ofc but still enjoy playing it, not worth 60 euro so waited untill it was like 8 euro then it was a ez cop"
8681,"Picked this up dirt cheap. Right from the off it annoys the hell out of me. 

The second it loads it requires an IN GAME update. Why not through steam? Oh that's right, they want to keep you in game to use up your 2 hours refund window. 

I've always HATED unskippable cutscenes in games, if you don't want to watch them, why are you FORCED to? What type of arrogant developer thinks their terrible cutscenes have to be viewed? Well, these ones of course, but it's not just in game cutscenes, oh no, you're forced to watch footage of some old guy and women desperately trying to be millennials, out of touch, TELLING you what you're about to see. Yeah, no. I don't need some 4 minute footage telling me I'm about to create my character. Just let me create the damn thing. 

Of course, the pushy microtransactions ALL OVER THE PLACE. 

I've played 2k games before and I've only ever gotten them free or picked up in a deep, deep DEEP sale. Never, ever spend money on the games with anything other than free or deep sale. Don't forget, the games only last 2 years before they shut down the servers too. So if you're a first time buyer, you won't be able to play in 2 years from release. 

The actual basketball is pretty decent though it seems to get more clunky over the years."
8682,"Great sports game!
"
8683,shit runs smooth just wish pc version of game was supported and pushed because it is THE BEST VERSION OF NBA2K Hands Down. RUNS SOOO SMOOTH
8684,got this on special and bought legend edition for 30$. only buy on special bc this siht is glitched af
8685,"MyGM is rubbish. The game is buggy to the max and keeps shutting down randomly. MyLeague is some fun, feels like a good alternative to MyGm. Haven't even tried MyPlayer, afraid it will kill all good memories I made with previous NBA 2k games."
8686,sucks
8687,69 Hours... Nice

8691,"Actually one of the worst NBA simulators I've played. I dont even care about how overpriced VC or anything on the micro transaction end is. This game feels like a total chore to play. You should never miss an insanely open shot that any G League Player would easily make just because the game doesn't think you have enough ratings. I've been open so many times and missed a layup under the rim with a 7ft+ player for absolutely no reason. Your teammates in my Career are entirely retarded and cant setup anything. If your a new player against a star like Lebron, you have absolutely zero chance of defending them no matter how well you play it, simply because the game doesnt want you to. You get stuck in this horrible animations inside the paint constantly if you come remotely close to another player which results in tons of 3 second penalties. Its fun and easy before you get to the NBA but when you get in even if you bought VC and have 85 overall your absolute trash. The game itself is designed to make you feel like garbage until you grind badges and upgrade your OVR. I dont know how this series is the top of the line for NBA games. It feels like total sluggish glitchy shit to play. Please don't buy this for your own sanity. Wait for NBA live or something to come to PC because its impossible to make a game this unfun and unrealistic so NBA Live has to be better,"
8692,"Riddled with Micro Transactions, gameplay that feels stuck in the same place of the last 5+ years, and a game that obviously has not been optimized in any way for the PC gaming experience makes this tough to recommend."
8693,Avoid at all cost!!! Pay to win game.

( Goes to do max contract with 2.0 teammate bonus ) 
GM - I'm going to be blunt here, you're not a max contract player and you never will be. 

What the actual fuck 2k, this shit's beyond stupid."
8704,"Good game, 2K21 soon :)"
8705,I never touched park bcos there are too many hackers but i like to play the myteam and mycareer mode
8706,Shit ass broken game
8707,not as bad as people say buy it cheap tho
8708,Good and deep overall game. Has lacked in-basketball game improvements and innovations the past few years but has maintained its good overall standards.
8709,"There is a literal myriad of issues with this game, both with running and playing the game itself.

First of all, you will struggle to consistently play this game without unexplained crashes. I have a Machine that is far beyond the requisites to run this game on maxed out settings, but I have had to pretty much slash all settings by 50% to have any luck with completing Four Quarters without issues. Resulting in players that look like amorphous clay replicants made by partially blind lobster-clawed mongoloids. Even with this, you will have crashes every few games if your lucky, usually every other. When you are having an All Star Level performance, closing out a game in the fourth quarter, guess what. Its Crash time. This draws all the fun out of a game, being constantly paranoid that after Four Crashes in a Game 7 playoff clash that all your efforts will go to Jack-Diddly-Sh*t for a Fifth time. This I feel is a result of 2K not porting this game properly for PC, which when they decide to charge full-price for a half-finished and frankly lazily ported game feels like day-light-robbery.

Now, when you are lucky to possibly string togethor more than a game or two you will begin to notice the issues within the game itself. If I were to list the issues that I have encountered after stomaching 175 Hours of gameplay I would probably match that number of hours in writing an encompassed and exhaustive list. A few and no where near in depth list can be summarised below:

1 - Game's are rigged with a clearly dictated narrative for how a game will map out. From the infamous '31 - 11' Lead being blown after you are checked out for 6 minutes being the most consistent '2K' icing on all of its previous titles. This is less of an issue relative to the other numerous problems, but is still a dick-slap to the face.

2 - Shooting. Even as a 93 rated Sharpshooter with 95+ shooting stats, unless you green a shot there is what feels like a '95%' change of you bricking the shot. Yes, you can probably blame that on form, but after this many years and hours of playing, a 'half-barred' release will feel like it has the same chance of splashing as a release that is a pubic-hair away from being a sweet-green release. This often feels exemplified during those games that feel the most rigged as aforementioned, which you can sense in the First Quarter. 

3 - Clipping. I have had so many cases where the ball will quite literally clip through players. Want a clean block, fancy a sneaky steal, wondering how that acute bounce passed through the defenders legs. Its probably because the Ball literally passed through the player like some transient spirit seeking a new parasitic host. The fact that this game is classed as 'E-Sport' ready yet has issues like this plagued throughout the game is an absolute joke.

I know that Buying this game was my first mistake (A mistake I hope, Nay Pray that you don't make), whilst spending/enduring 175 hours attempting to drag myself through glass to enjoy it was the second. I like many of you, are Basketball fans, with NO alternative in gaming to meet our needs we decide to still return year in and year our to this dishevelled 'Sheen-esque' mess of a game. This won't change till 'NBA Live' or some alternative competition provides the much needed jarring incentive for '2K' to decide to actually care about the game and its users. Either that, or you can avoid providing them with the incentive to continue producing and repackaging a frankly sh*t game by not buying it. 

Apologies for the long but-still-to-short rant about this 'Game'. Although, combined with the countless negative reviews that others have written this would be merely a page amongst the Quran length collection that would be amalgamated if all our negative reviews were to be compiled. 

DON'T DO IT."
8710,It's aight
8711,"This game is a joke, The Devs are morons if they think this is how basketball is played, Also hackers have taken over the park with Hacked lvl 99 legends so don't even bother
This game is literal cancer"
8712,Why i cant make a My Fucking Player on NBA 2k20?
8713,It's still the same old game since 2K16 with little to no improvements. The micro-transaction has gotten worse and the graphics is still the same. 2K can't keep this for too long.
8714,This game is number 1
8715,Good Graphics
8716,The worst NBA game that 2k has ever released.

"
8727," i dont play online, so i cant say much or share the same frustrations as those who are complaining about the online game play... but even on single player... the gameplay is straight trash. i'm pretty sure 7/10 if not more cross court passes or outlet passes get thrown out of bounds. some are pretty straightforward passes, but they get thrown straight out of bounds and it just kills the fast break or passing out of double teams. it's so frustrating"
8728,"Game is good ,but the Server  suck"
8729,really good game worth the money your are paying on that game
8730,terrible broken pile of crap! DO NOT BUY!
8731,It's great
8732,"great game i dont know why there is so much hate

one think I would change though is those shitty headphones 'beats'. It makes me sick they have such a presence in this game when in reality they are overpriced shit"
8733,"Well, I've been playing 2k games since 2015... 
For some uknown reason I got banned.
There are hundreds of cheaters on the server yet they chose to ban me. 
When I asked them to tell me the reason they didn't want to tell me. 
Huge dissapointment. That's how 2K treats loyal players."
8734,"Shitty server with fucking retarded Internet connection. It was a good game until the server keeps disconnecting people and crashes a lot. Would only recommend if the server was better. It is surprised that the server is even worst than the Ubisoft one, and keeps disconnecting people in MyCareer park. And it sells at USD$99.99 with this experience."
8735,The game is fun but if you plan on playing online do not get it for pc. There are not enough online players on pc and you will have to wait forever for a game on my team.
8736,nice
8737,Game just bugs out during game play just because 2k has trash servers
8738,"People hate this game because of multiplayer and the micro-transactions; but the way I see it, you can avoid both of those things and still get a good basketball game where you can play as your favourite NBA teams/players. I wouldn't pay full price though."
8739,"I would only recommend NBA 2K20 on the PC to anyone who wants to install mods for the game. Without mods, this game is better on the console. The PC 2K community is not as popular or as large as the console community, at least for online modes. Without modding, this game is a solid 5.5 to 6 (on a scale of 10). Being able to install mods has brought that to an 8. I would stay away from online modes, especially park, on PC due to the amount of hackers/cheaters. In my opinion, this version of the game is better played offline, and with mods. Again, I do not recommend this to anyone who wants to hop into a few park games or MyTeam, but instead to those who are looking to install mods and have an immersive MyLeague, MyGM, or MyCareer experience."
8740,good
8741,"This graffic is very nice, music is very good, halftime is cool and details is amazing!"
8742,"Absolute garbage.  If you most enjoy the MyLeague game mode, be aware that designing your own uniforms and courts is broken, with the ""there was a problem saving the arena / uniform"" bug. And the game won't let me map the buttons on my controller. Googling tells me 2K is aware of these bugs that literally make the game unplayable, and has no interest in fixing them. Also in MyLeague, player chemistry is so broken that, halfway through the season, I looked at the ""rumor mill"" tab and counted 20 players who had made public trade demands.  In real life, this happens maybe on average once per season.  2K makes the players such cantankerous a-holes it's basically impossible to team build through the draft.  (Your rookies won't stand to be on a losing team.)

The game is broken. Do not waste your money, even if it goes on sale, and you start thinking about how much you miss the NBA. This game ain't nothing but a pain in your ass."
8743,"The game glitches out when I enter myTeam 3v3 mode and it still uses my contracts. Glitched a few times and all my contracts are gone. 

Stupid game anyways if the game wants you to lose you cant win anyways it just forces you backcourt stupid turnovers etc.

And can the game stops crashing its really fking annoying"
8744,sometimes the connection to nba2k is very bad and my player file is corrupt because the connection to nba2k is bad
8745,good game
8746,"great game, only the black top works...pro am doesnt even load up"
8747,Get this game when it is on sale.

8764,Pretty fun
8765,fuck you
8766,This community is toxic. Right now as i type there is a player that has me paused on the game multiplayer mode TTO just because of a tmac card LOL he has the screen as to hes gonna report me LOL toxic ass player and community in general

MyCareer is the best and neighborhood."
8769,fuck
8770,Great game.
8771,"Game is good , it improves very slow and the VC prices are just stupid (60k for a skateboard)  , even though they have a lot of  adds  in the game they still make them prices so high, which is the biggest -, other than that game is good , i just hope that 2k's greed goes away, and they make the prices normal , i am cool with the adds :)"

8774,pretty much the worst NBA game I have every played graphics are fine story is fine but the gameplay terrible
8775,it good beckos it gudd
8776,"NBA 2k is the pentacle of modern sports gaming. I love the RPG component, online community, and the PvP component within the game. i love the attribute system and dynamism it provides and wish to see how complex it can get as it imitates real life."
8777,sdcsad
8778,wow
8779,"This game makes me angry, but I'm still playing it, so I guess it's fine. Still, it feels like they know there's no competition for an NBA-themed game.

Also, why do I have to wait SO LONG for everything? All the long menus, timeouts, animations, and unskippable videos? Why do you feel the need to repeatedly waste 5+ seconds of my time?"
8780,"Bruh this junk so glitchy has a cool badge system but still some cheeks, can't even green 100% of the time even if you time your jumpshots perfectly."

8782,Its not fair to the community that the 2K cooperation charges full price for NBA 2k20 on PC for full price esp when the servers are buggy and there is no actual PC support. Hackers roam the parks without getting banned. Hard to find fun. Stop sleeping on one of the largest gaming platforms and optimize it well and maybe the sales on PC will skyrocket.
8783,wasd
8784,is good
8785,"Worst NBA 2K game I've ever played in my entire life and I've been playing since NBA 2K7. Poor and broken mechanics, awful and unrealistic animation. MyCareer cut scenes are wack. You have to spend actual money to get anything in the game. The game crashed on me and froze my PC 4 times today. I gave up and uninstalled it immediately. I will no longer waste my money on such rubbish games, and good thing I only bought it for $20. NBA 2K games have quickly diminished in value and content and they've taken a steep nosedive since 2K16."
8786,fuckig cunt
8787,i couldnt play it. it wouldnt update thanks to 2k great servers i would love if i could play the game i put money into
8788,Worst Nba2k ever!!!!!!!!!!! Being in a slow data country this game is pretty useless because all of the mode needed fast internet. I can't even buy apparels for myplayer because the neighborhood lag so much that in throws me out of myCareer if I go into the neighborhood. Pretty useless game intended only to milk money from rich people.
8789,"Even though the game is full of bugs and glitches it is still enjoyable enough to play, I mean it's basketball right? Biggest issue is cheaters. Everywhere, I mean honestly I don't even bother checking anymore if the guy is cheater or reporting them as it doesn't change anything. Most of the time cheaters suck, that's why they cheating I guess and You can outplay them easily. But oh boy if You play against the ones with wingpsan of 2 kilometersa and 60 HOF badges, good luck... Don't buy this game on PC, You will save money and Your precious mental health."
8790,Dont buy this game i dont even  know why they put it on pc. The developers wont ban the hackers so the online play is just hackers
8791,I have never been more disappointed with a video game before than this one. The lack of optimization and laziness of 2K has really shown its true colors on PC. It always crashes when I play MyCareer even though I have very capable specs and it just annoys me how I have to find all of the issues with the game rather than enjoying my hard earned money by playing. This game on the PC is an absolute failure and should not be purchased whatsoever.
8792,greattttt
8793,yes
8794,Eveything must online and this nba must think about salary in my career its just didnt real there is maybe 2k must think about game money not just vc
8795,this game is fun
8796,the only reason anyone should buy this is for mods if you plan on actually trying to play the game go back to 2k19
8797,"i like the game but needs to fix the game crash but overall good game
"
8798,"I have been playing 2K as my main game for the last 8 years, and I can not believe how far they've fallen. After 3 games of myteam I can not progress any further due to the sheer frustration that emerges when playing. There is a very noticable input lag on the OFFLINE myteam games. An input lag that I have no interest in getting used to because it sucks every bit of possible enjoyment from the game. Why is there an input lag when simply playing against the CPU? it makes no sense. I have lost complete interest in mycareer long ago when it had some dumb rapper fuck trying to bring me down. What fucking idiot thought that a subpar story line is what people who play 2K wanted???? The entire game is a funnel into micro transactions, which makes the bugs and server issues even more frustrating. 
I've logged thousands of hours into past 2k's and I just can't imagine coming close with this excuse for a game.
Edit- I made this review when I had around 100 hours in. I now have around 1000 hours in this game and I can't believe how much I've let my life be wasted by this game. All the frustration and anger I've felt while being addicted to this mediocre excuse for a yearly title is heartbreaking. The idea of a basketball video game is so enticing that I've pretended like this product is a okay use of time. But I finally can't do it. After game after game of pathetic animations and blatant microtransaction advertisement I've realized this game will never be the game I wish it was. The developers either have no interest or aren't allowed to make a game that feels realiably... fun. That's where this game really falls. The hard difficulty's aren't challenging. They're broken. Every multiplayer gamemode has such insane power-creep that it makes the game of basketball nearly irrelevant to where NBA JAM is a more accurate simulation of strategic play. Plays are broken to the point where you spam a single play against CPU's or you run back and forth in the halfcourt so that human opponents are left in the dust by stuttering animations. I feel relieved that I was pushed by this game to my breaking point with it, because I have known for a while that this game isn't good. I mean look at any youtuber/streamer for 2k. They are angry CONSTANTLY because of flaws with the games CORE structure. 
""Raging"" is the most common form of 2k streamer and after this much time with the game, I can't imagine how you could play it and not feel some sort of unjust anger constantly.

8800,"Possibly the worst 2K game to date. My career, is a cash grab, making your player so bad that you have to by VC to have any hope of competing or enjoying the experience. Rookie or not, someone drafted into the NBA should be able to make a wide open shot at 6ft with an excellent shot rating, yet you will often miss these shots. You will get called for fouls when no foul has been made. Mini games in practice are not fun, unrewarding and confusing. got your team rating up in a game? make one mistake and you are penalized harshly, yet you are a rookie and should be expected to make mistakes. 

Let it be known that, I own most of the NBA2K games, most I have played at great length and this is the first game in the series that I have left a negative review for. All of the 2k20 games are trash and should be avoided at this point."
8801,cool
8802,.
8803,"This game is trash don't buy unless its really cheap, definitely NOT worth 80$"
8804,best nba game for pc
8805,great game
8806,verry fun and smooth
8807,8iug
8808,"Don't get fooled by my steam time, i have been playing 2k20 since launch on ps4, having only recently migrated to PC. I probably have around 500 hours in this game, and around 5000 hours if you sum all NBA 2K games.

While it's objectively not a great game, it's the only option we have for a basketball sim.

Gameplay: was better than 2k19, but 2k decided to break it and now it's horrible, specially when regarding paint game. Post-ups, putbacks, layups, dunks, everything inside is a mess in 2k20.

Graphics: decent. They really put 0 effort on player likeness outside of the Lakers, though. John Collins is a 85 overall in-game and his hair hasn't been updated in a year. Mind you, all he did was shave his head. Extremely simple to put in-game, and 2k hasn't done yet. Other players on weaker teams have the same problem.

EDIT: 2k21 trailer is out and 2k20 is still trash, just like 2k19 was. Don't buy 2k21 either unless you love basketball as well.

Multiplayer: absolute trash as always. Bad servers, park is just a battle to see who cheeses the system more, MyTeam is full of retardly broken cards that strip the mode of all it's fun, and other modes, i.e. play now online, receive no attention

MyGM/MyLeague: same shit as always.

Microtransactions are actually better than last year, despite all the controversies. Grinding overalls is much easier than before, and all the added cassino stuff on MyTeam isn't actually paid.

TLDR; Same as always. Buy 2k if you need to play a basketball game, and only buy it if it's on sale. I bought it for the equivalent of $8 US Dollars, so it was def worth it."
8809,"My League is good, it's the style I enjoy. It is missing some essential things like being able to tell what teams have cap space when trying to find a trade but overall it is a good game style for this seasons title.
On sale, and in this case, from a humble bundle, this game is worth it to me."
8810,Trash sever with lagging and hack.
8811,This game is bugged bugged bugged and bugged some more. And it will never be fixed by EA cuz they don't give a crap. Money in the bag and on to the next buggy game.
8812,"Pre good game overall
"
8813,i think you should not override diamond shoe and lost it
8814,error code and mathcing making is most BS for myteam
8815,"Im addicted. Its not even funny,"
8816,shitty game too many bugs
8817,This game is the best NBA game I've ever played and I deffenetly recomend this to other people
8818,"horrible imput lagg in online, unplayable"
8819,It's okay.
8820,bad server cant even play with friend keep disconecting server so shit dont bother
8821,So far so good
8822,if you can handle the hackers then its worth it
8823,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
8824,ass
8825,"Game itself is probably like a 6 or 7 out of ten at most. However, it is poorly optimized for PC and still has bugs. I can't even play the game anymore because the in-game download is stuck a 0% despite doing everything 2K has said to do. It seriously annoys me how much 2K has fallen."
8826,ttt
8827,"Alright if you plan to play Myleague/ Solo My career. DO NOT BUY FOR 50 THATS CRAZY TALK. Buy on newegg or stream for 20 or maybe cheaper. No an-ti cheat, or lack of enforcement makes Park solo pointless. Pro-am may work but you need a squad, and you could run into the squad of god prospects which will leave you wishing you never bought. I wish it didn't crash like it did in myleague but it doesn't really happen too often where i wanna break my keyboard. Lowkey mouse and key board would be cool, but I cant map shoot as a mouse click? I like being able to map dribbles thats nice. Lowkey fun but you have to make it fun. This game (AT 20 buck) shouldn't be judged poorly because of its online, its mods and other settings make it enjoyable....for 20 bucks. Asking 60 for this AWFUL port of an already AWFUL game that should be the easiest to port! Come on at least have easy anti cheat! Like wtf 2k every year you almost go over the top. but fuck it up ALWAYS. so sad. I don't recommend at 60$"
8828,It is awesome
8829,the game is shit every time i make a player and add vc to it they disapper and all support say is we need a video of the player but how can i when its gone i lost over 60 bucks worth of vc

8835,Excellent gameplay
8836,My player is the reason to play this tbh.
8837,This is not a game. This is fxxking disgusting trash. DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE.
8838,"Crashes after NBA Finals. I opt to be a free agent, after I picked my desired team it crashes, tried everything, reinstall, update drives and verify the game, nothing happened. This game sucks so bad!"
8839,fuck you ronnie2k
8840,its fun
8841,sometimes when you play story it goes super slow and you cant skip. and also the download stops at 0 (in game update)
8842,good
8843,"As I always recommend, only buy sports games when they are on sale. These games don't drastically change in a year, but if there's one that is worth $20-$30, it's NBA 2K. The game is fun, though scripted as any other sports game, so keep that in mind."
8844,Its a very good game but lags sometimes i'm used to lagging but u really have to have a good WiFi connection in order to play with a good experience. Another thing is that is very choppy even if it wasn't lagging. I do recommend it but don't get mad when it gets annoying. And one more thing and this has been happening for a very long time and it's when i get a code for instance today i was supposed to get a diamond CP3 because it's locker code had just dropped on twitter so i used the code and landed the ball in the blue which was supposed to give me diamond CP3 but instead it gave the i opened it got the card but couldn't use it because it wasn't in my card collection so plz fix that sometime.
8845,"yes,"
8846,everything its very relaxing if your high :D

8863,reccomended game with friends and family..:)
8864,"Best basketball game on the market. Worst game on the market. Expect to buy in-game currency worth 40 bucks before it becomes enjoyable or grind for 150 hours as a shit player. 

The game is also extremely unstable, with frequent crashes, extremely long loading screens of up to five minutes before you can enter the park area. A typical NBA game has many unskippable scenes making a single game take about an hour with only 25 minutes of actual gameplay. 
The story is non-existant with all your cut scenes being about your endorsements which are actually just product placements in disguise. The actual story completely stops after the prelude and is only hinted at. Also fuck Dorris Burke as a commentator. She is pretty okay in actual NBA games but in this game she is just a nasaly twat who sounds like she doesn't give a f... 

When the game runs it's an amazing basketball game, but everything around it is just a scam and so poorly optimized for PC. I suggest, if you have it to use Synergy2K and play ""mycareer"" in myleague using a character lock. google it if you want to know more. I said this was the last 2k game I would purchase but I somehow broke and bought it, when the NBA shut down due to you-know-what. Never again until they make a better single-player experience as that is what I play it for. Are we ever going to see an ""offline"" build without limitations put in place to make online games fair? coop mycareer games? an actualy story a la 2k17, which was actually good? Probably not"
8865,It's very interesting.
8866,best game
8867,great game!!!!

8879,"Game is good, 2k...not so much(f*ck u ronnie)"
8880,"Absolute atrocious game, favors fluidity of animations rather than good gameplay"
8881,more fun than u think
8882,"I think this is the only game that as the years go by it gets worse and worse. I think the team that is working on it are bunch of retards (excuse my assumption but it's pretty hard not to assume that). They all focus on who to bring into the story in the game as in NBA stars, celebrities etc than to fix the actual gameplay playable on all platforms. But the biggest fact of that we all are aware about it but still too blind to see it is that we are the idiots... for still FUCKING buying it!"
8883,its great to play if you have friends
8884,"Great game, I don't understand why a lot of people hate on this so much. I mean, yeah, there are a few things I don't like all too much, but that's no reason to flat out hate on it. Great job 2K keep it up."
8885,gud
8886,"Mediocre experience for offline, multiplayer is trash."
8887,First off this game is fun but only with a controler. Keyboard & mouse this game is underwhelming. The biggest downfall is this games bugs and glitches. I Haven't been able to play 3-4 games on without the game freezing or crashing all together.
8888,sucks
8889,Very good game! I like everything in  NBA 2K20. Mostly I play my career and my league. I recommend this game to everybody who like sport and basketball.
8890,FFFFFFFFFFFF
8891,"Great for offline play, but avoid if you like to play MyCareer player online activities like Park, Rec, Pro-Am etc. It is literally a hacking fest with NO hack detection. From body hacks to stat hacks I've seen it all. US-East servers are probably 60% hacker, 40% legit and it drains the fun right out of playing legit."
8892,Fun basketball game. Just don't give 2K money
8893,"The mycareer is good but park is full of hackers...
"
8894,"what the hell? Its making me redownload this shit which i already waited A MOTHER FUCKING DAY FOR WHAT THE HELL YOU ARE MAKING ME REDOWNLOAD THIS SHIT AFTER A WHOLE DAY OF PLAYING I JUST GOT OFF THE GOD DAMN FUCKING GAME AND NOW IT WANTS ME TO INSTALL THIS SHIT DIDNT YOU JUST SEE ME PLAYING THIS SHIT? NOW I HAVE TO WAIT 2 FUCKING PRECIOUS DAYS OF GRINDING TO LET IT DOWNLOAD I AM STEAMING

8895,Love the game especially being locked in the house.
8896,GOOD
8897,"After seeing all the negative reviews, I have still decided to purchase the game. 

Don't do it.

This game freezes after 5-10 minutes of playing and only seems to work properly on specific hardware. I have an i5/1050 laptop which should be able to run the game perfectly fine yet the game just refuses to work. I've give up.

Go play NBA 2k19, at least that shit works."

8901,"ProAm doesnt work on pc, entering it will cause you to have to restart your game. There are no matchmaking settiings to find games on street, leaving you to be forced to walk around finding unevenly matched games. A abundance of hackers have ruined the street courts, with characters who have perfect 3 point shots repeatedly even though there character has no 3 point shooting abilities. The game is essentially pay to win basketball, allowing you to use real money to buy boosts for your character allowing them to perform above their natural abilities."

It would be a great game but it is not... this is a disaster.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
8912,"This game rocks. I haven't played 2k since about 2014, but the game is sooo  realistic. The animations are so accurate, that I can't even fathom how they could make all these players jumpshots and hooks and dunks perfectly. It also includes wnba."
8913,"This game sucks. Don't buy it. People with no three point skill can shoot threes. People with no defence can stop centers from scoring. I got kicked from a 1v1, because of bad sportsmanship and trolling, when i had shot some pretty awful shots. Your skill doesnt matter, it's all up to the randomness of the animations you get. You can have 99 perimiter defence, but still let the oponent score, when you get a bad animation. DO. NOT. BUY."
8914,"If you play this for the MyLeague mode like i do then this game is literally a 10/10. The game play is pretty good and the creative freedom in MyLeague is totally dope - there is very little restrictions aside from some necessary boundaries in what you can do to the NBA as a whole in ML. You can edit any player, create a player at any time, you can choose to control 1 or even all 30 teams; not to mention you can do league expansions, change a teams home city and court/uniform designs plus sooo much more. Keep in mind, any My League save can be kept for up to 80 seasons i believe which is just awesome imo. Do not pay full price though as i do not believe the other modes are worth it. Wait for a sale!
- Just my two cents."
8915,please help. missing game on library for nba2k20
8916,if you really a baller this game will be always amazing for you
8917,absolute fucking garbage
8918,"This game still sucks, multiplayer isn't working good. Whenever I join my friend one of us randomly crashes. Nobody plays the rec center. However I keep buying this shit every year and complain about the same problems. Gonna buy 2k21 too when it comes out, cause I want to support the poor Ronnie2k. 
0/10 wouldnt recommend. But would recommend 10/10 if you have no reason to live."
8919,good
8920,shit game
8921,good game
8922,"This game has potential to be decent. However, they can't seem to control the hackers that are ruining the game for everyone. The amount of hackers in this game almost outnumber the amount of real players. I expect better from 2k21 but that is probably too much to ask. lol"
8923,"i love the nba.  i love basketball.  there are issues with gameplay, balance, grinding, etc in this game.  but for the love of basketball, all that is acceptable... the problem is the hackers.  you can't go 2 games in a row without having a player with a 10' wingspan, unlimited range and speed on their 7'3 center, or any other bs.  it's just not worth sinking hours into the grind, just to run into something that's so preventable. the fact that it's such a problem just shows 2k doesn't care, and if 2k doesn't care then it's not worth caring about their game.

f 2k"
8924,"I would only recommend this game if you're into the single player modes. MyLeague and MyGM (especially MyLeague) are the two best franchise modes in sports gaming today. The gameplay is as beautiful as ever! Some people say that the game seems ""slower"" this year. As in players move slower. If that's a problem for you, they have a slider for that....easy fix. I don't play the career mode, at all. Can't speak on it. From what I read though, it's at the very least many times better than Madden. That's not saying much though LOL

I have heard horror stories, endlessly, about the multiplayer in this game. If that's what you're interested in I recommend staying away. I would never play a sports game online lol. The MyLeague and MyGM immersion is the best is the entire sports game genre to me. They have re-created every single salary and trade rule true to real life. You can change the way contracts are structured for players, back-loading them, front-loading them, evenly spreading them (although this feature has been in franchise modes for 2K for years now). Regardless, that isn't found in Madden or even The Show. I don't know about NHL games. The customization sliders for MyLeague are incredible. What a level of immersion. Best single-player sports game on the market!"
8925,"By far the worst 2k I've played. The mycareer was better in previous games, the mechanics are extremely clunky, and the game isn't worth the price by a longshot. 

Don't waste your time."

8927,this game is cool totally worth of buying you guys should buy .
8928,"MyLeague=best basketball game ever made.
MyTeam/MyCareer=biggest cash grab possible. 

We all need to boycott buying VC for a year. It will suck for a while but maybe it will force them to change the freemium model we are current stuck with. 

Take 2 Interactive: Please stop letting the financial department have so much influence in the player development aspects of the game. It took me a hundred hours to get a 90 overall PG. That would be fine if i didnt start with the legend edition (100000 VC) and bought a couple of VC packs. All to get one player up to a 90. Not 99 but 90! Pay to win is not fun even if money is no issue at all for you. Not everyone makes money like The Game and can buy millions of VC at will. Shame! Can't recommend unless you just want to play MyLeague mode."
8929,Tasty with SHAQ Attack in Defence
8930,trash game
8931,"I don't care about online and microtransactions, I just wanted to jump into the career mode again after not playing the game the last couple of years. 

I get drafted, play from the bench as a Rookie, I hit ""simulate to next appearance"" and nothing happens. Even worse, I have to watch the game play out in slow-motion. A game that would usually take 5 minutes (since I don't get a lot of minutes as a Rookie) takes about 30 minutes and I just sit there and can't do anything. 
This has existed since release. I hadn't touched this game in a few months, I had hoped that they might have fixed it, so gave it another try, Still the same issue, after months.

Still unplayable for me after all this time and multiple patches. Unfortunately creating my player and going through the story to make it to the NBA took longer than 2 hours (everything worked fine during that part). 

Used to love those games years ago but it's a shame to see what they have done with the series..."
8932,"This is by far the worst NBA game I've played in my 40 years of life.
None of the players specific or signature moves are present. Have you ever saw Shaq below rim going out to shoot????  MJ not dunking when alone on layup etc etc..
Mechanics are terrible as well. I didn't find player which can drilble ball below basket not to go out of bounds. Pit Maravich is 2 times faster than Jordan and can easy run two circles around him while Jordan makes 3 steps etc. Most of the shooters will hit basket only from one dot. Centers are shooting below basket and frequently are missing easiest layups. Don't buy this game it is complete waste of money"
8933,"its amazing

8936,The game is incredibly unpolished and requires a massive grind to play without paying more than $60. Keep the cash and spend it on a game that was actually fully developed instead of this half baked garbage.
8937,good
8938,Piece of shit

8940,gets a bad rep but i enjoy it
8941,"Quite fun, but i have a big problem with blacktop. The players use these wierd t shirts instead of their own jerseys, it pisses me off sometimes. The court is also a downgrade from the previous games, The blue floor just don't look good, i prefer 2K16 blacktop, team jerseys and just a normal basketball court in a park. Please fix this or atleast make 2K21 blacktop more like 2K16 blacktop."

8955,"This might be one of the worst running games I've ever gotten. It freezes for 15-60 seconds every 5-10 minutes when playing a game. The controller disconnects half the time I'm playing, even though it shows its connected. During MyPlayer I cant skip to when I'm put in the game, its hard to play this game for more than an hour when it constantly freezes or the buttons don't work."
8956,"Love this game. I had a lot of fun playing with my friends, especially in MyPark. Cannot wait to buy 2k21 next year!"

8973,"If you like playing games where the creators allow cheaters to run wild. Hackers everywhere. If you don't cheat, your not top tier as you can't compete. Lots of crashes, entering multiplayer game modes. To have a good experience with a real only basketball multiplayer game you have to join private discord servers that regulate their own rules to weed out cheaters and play organized basketball with this game."
8974,"If you like to play with hackers and love to get your butt whooped by them, I 100% recommend this game to all. If you hate playing against hackers and don't want to waste your time in doing so, don't bother to spend your $60 on this game. Go use it on some food for your children!!"

8977,"This review is only for the career mode,  feels like its just a quick money grab in a suppose to be a single player game mode, a half hour game play may give you 1 point or so, and that's almost 400 point/150-200 hour play time to achieve max which isn't even the best player in the game. of course you can just buy power ups in a 60 game's single player mode."

9013,"I'm honestly kinda mad I bought this game even at the steep discount of 26.99 CAD... This garbage is a recycled 2k19 with suprisingly even more delayed input lag than last year's game, making it feel slower and less enjoyable to play. The park is quite literally the exacts same as last years?! They try and tell you leveling up is easier this year, but they dont tell you you're still going to have to fork over another $50 to even somewhat compete on the court with other cash cows... They added a useless WNBA roster update I have yet to play and have no intentions of doing so, all while leaving the most desired game modes of MyTeam and MyLeague virtually untouched.  All of the problems I faced in last year's game: disconnecting from games, input lag, piss-poor game performance online etc, are all still very much present and not fixed. No true meaningful progress on this game from last years"
9014,"I bought this game out of desperation for the 2020 nba season lockdown. The only other 2k instance I bought was 2k18. I wasn't expecting anything different from the usual but...
Man.
Priced at 59'99. Plagued with their infamous vc market. Has more bugs in it than a rotten apple. God forbid you actually download their patches or updates, cause they only seem to make things worse. Appalling communication with their playerbase. Plus, remember this is not a conventional game, rather it feels like a subscription. You're paying not for the game itself, which will be useless and completely devoid of any features as soon as 2k21 rolls out (and as soon as the servers shut down, you won't be able to play even in my career), you're paying for what's in fact a season pass.
Yet it is the biggest basketball game ever produced and sadly thanks to 2k's exclusive deals with the NBA there's actually 0 chance to see any kind of competition whatsoever in the future.
 2k is a pitiful excuse for a game developer, and they feast on what is unfortunately one of the easiest playerbases to exploit: sports fans. Again: you're paying 60 dollars just to get the game (for 12 months). You'll need to spend at least thrice that amount to have a decent myplayer (after 103 hours of play, with 0 euros spent in vc, myplayer is a measly 81), and boy, if you want to get any of the goodies like tattoos or vehicles or shoes be prepared to reach for your credit card really often.
I encourage you NOT TO BUY THIS GAME, and if you're desperate enough to buy it, DON'T BUY VCs! Just don't feed a toxic market, it's for everyone's good."

9020,"this game is too good
"
9021,It looks nice and its funny to play
9022,"paras koska siinä pelataan korista
"
9023,"Fuck this shit. MyCareer is pure cancer, the game trolls you all the time, even on pro, with adversaries more glued to you than ever, instantly snapping out of nowhere every time you are free and shoot, teammates instantly changing direction once you pass to them just to end up in a turnover, your teammate Lebron James that suddently can't score more than 8 points a game nor score one single dunk, while the opposition start to posterize your team again and again all game. Every game out of 5 the opposition turn into absolute GODMODE: they score 70%+ contested shots, they just run at you then to whatever animation and just score, while you while when you are attacking the cpu litterally slow you down and make you trip over the ball, or completely ignores your controls when you outsmart it. The AI litterally cheats all the time. To get an average 70 player you would need to play 50 48 minutes game to earn enough vc. Of course the game tries to blatantly compensate this by saying you have an average 80 even if you barely have 4 stats at 70. Why? because they are buying reviews and telling people to say that this year vc grind is less of a pain.. well, IT IS NOT! It is even worse, because even if you don't HAVE to go through all the stupid trainings, even if you are getting some vcs here and there, the AI ingame litterally cheats all the time making these progresses not relevant.  Game is also filled with commercials. ""It has always been"" you would say, but not like this: Once every few games the game will force you into a boring ass animation and cutscene in which you have to see your character act and say bullshit their sponsor asks him to say. Like litterally, agents come to you to tell you ""during next interview say that this drink makes you fly"", and then you have to go through some bullshit interview to say how great this bullshit drink is. Basically you are a dickhead, desperate for money liar, some cheap egomaniac with no ethics nor personality, that everyone likes for no apparent reason. The story is a constant pain, one video after the other of pointless and nonsensical exchanges. As usual the story don't reflect at all anything resembling truth: you are a promising player that every single athlete in the league come to you just to tell you they admire you. You are an absolute prick always saying cheesy stuff, and everyone is pending from your disgusting lips. At start, everyone comes to you saying that you are this predestined superstar talent, and you can't score two FT in sequence as a Shooting Guard. Game is as usual a total scam to lure people into spending on VCs. There are absolytely terrible reviews on youtube showing why this is a total scam, so be sure to check those.

 Also the game is filled like never before of time waste videos, loadings, animation before every single thing, just to FRUSTRATE YOU INTO BUYING CREDITS ONLY NOT TO SUCK IN GAME. Then after a few games, you will need to score 80 points game to not loose, and yet sometimes you will loose anyway, because the games say so. If you win, you don't feel the urge to buy credits, which this game is all about.

Why are people keeping on buying this shitty game? Why isn't people trying to stop this 2k horseshot game to be released and worsened again and again, every year, only for 2k trying to cashgrab more and more money? I fucking hate them, and all that this game represent and try to sell by this time. i used to like the NBA, now they made me litterally hate it. The worse possible publicity and partner for NBA: A sheetshow of shallowness, put up only for to squeeze all the possible money from the people watching it. Shame on 2k, and shame on NBA for partnering with these clowns."

9037,"Played this game for months on PS4 and the game is total rubbish especially online. horrendous LAG, and unfair plays and matchups. The only thing players do is customize defensive settings and then let the cpu do the work because honestly you can't really control the players due to delayed input and lag. Most of the time the game will match you up with a team that moves 50% faster than your team and sometimes the other way around. I suspect the game matches you up to players with faster servers. Open shots are so hard to hit and even if a player is open for a shot, because of the lag defenders can recover so quickly before you release the shot which is insane. I decided to buy this trash game on PC because I thought the game will improve due to better specs and LAN internet connection but still the same crap game and same problems. I'm connected to a fast fiber optic internet connection  and also tried the lowest video setting but still the game is trash. 2K just ripped me off twice!! I only want to play competitive online basketball fairly. it's just the same game every year I give up. NBA2K always hype on marketing the game but can't deliver at all."

9072,"It's not a bad game. The story is way better than 2K19, the gameplay is mostly the same, VC gains are increased and getting badges is easier since now it's a bar you fill instead of having to shoot 40000 3PTs to get a Badge from Gold to Hall of Fame. It could be better but it could be worse . 👀"

9075,"Hey 2K, a simple issue that the camera settings isn't saving yet you can't fix that. Overall the game is great but that bug is just too stupid, I'm only playing mycareer(yet) and everytime I got subbed out it reverts the camera to mycarrer camera. This bug is just so stupid. Really stupid."

9079,"Again, 2k refuses to implement an anti-cheat on the PC edition, which has resulted in park being plagued with cheaters once again. If you play any online modes, I strongly recommend getting the game on console, but the PC version is nice for other modes, such as MyLeague, as the loading times are much faster than console. If you play offline MyCareer, the mods make the mode very enjoyable, so if you only play offline the PC version is a must."
9080,hate it
9081,i KEEP ON LAGGING THIS GAME IS SO SKETCH
9082,"Another Nba 2k title where they changed little. Practically everything is copy pasted from previous Nba 2k title. AI is somewhat improved (I guess) but it still acts monumentally stupid when you're down points. Mycareer games become impossible and even make you question if the devs have seen any Nba games ever... Same stupid fouling and same animations from previous Nba 2k title and when you're down points the AI can't score again like previous games. When you're up points the game becomes tolerable and even enjoyable since you can score more easily and AI even behaves somewhat rationally. The Problem with AI is that it can't create consistently especially when you're down. No mid range shots are taken and it's always go to the basket and get contested or blocked or maybe it even gets one in. This is of course on your side of things. It's so tiresome how these that are supposedly based on a Team sport like basketball make the player carry the team and make the team incapable to run offence and make plays much less make plays that get you The player open. Mycareer also suffers from microtransactions where your player starts as a low level guy who somehow gets into the NBA without being able to play basketball at all. Your stats are so low that it's embarrassing and you having to carry the AI or just lose most games just forces you to buy virtual currecy to get better or grind and get infuriated. This game is stupid waste of time. 

Multiplayer is hardly any better the way it is handled. No communication methods in-game makes making a group in the park take too much time. Jordan rec center is at least a match making system but of course it's populated mainly by level 90+ players and limited number of lower level players sucking the fun out of that mode. 

Myteam is riddled with microtransactions with card packages you buy with real money and I really didn't care for it anyway."

9128,"My friends and I bought this game and initially really enjoyed it. We even took advantage of the ""pay to win"" aspect of the game so we could push forward quicker(lesson learned). My friends first character got deleted by a glitch. Now, all three of us have a glitch where we no longer gain XP and our attributes are bugged and say -56 or some variation of numbers. We attempted some fixes and did some research and as far as we can tell at this point our characters are busted and will never move past their current level(89). If you have played NBA2K20 and haven't had this issue I sure hope you don't. Who really wants to grind back through everything again, spend a bunch of VC and then potentially lose it all to a glitch. I will admit the game is pretty fun but the gitchs are game breaking and it doesn't appear that they are getting addressed."

Like for example: when you are playing training mode in career you are hitting most of the shots. But when you are in a match you suddenly cant hit a single baksket.

9150,Well its good if you like basketball
9151,"I'm giving up on this game because of its gameplay mechanics. For those who are not familiar with it, shots and layups are either beased on an individual percentage (each basketball player on this game has its own % chance of shot sucess) or based on a timing system (I'll explain it in a second). If you set the shot/layup setting to individual percentage, then you will face the game's RNG. If you set the shot/layup setting to timing, then you will face a tricky meter that charges accordingly to the time you keep the button pressed. Press it for a too short amount of time and it won't charge enough for the perfect spot (called a ""green release""), press it for a too long amount of time and it will exceed the perfect spot. It's tricky but at least it's fair. Well, only to a certain extent. There's one more gameplay mechanic which is much more annoying. Whenever you make a shot/layup, if there's an opponent defending it close enough, there's a HUGE chance you will miss that shot/layup. The game calls it a ""contested shot"". On the other hand if there's no opponent nearby, then it's called an ""open shot"". The problem with the contested shot mechanic is that it's not nearly fair when you play against the IA. If you are close enough to an opponent but you don't try to block the shot using the blocking action, it's almost guaranteed the opponent will hit the shot. However, if you are close enough and you do try to block the shot, then great are the chances you'll make a foul. The same goes for the stealing action. The unfair part here is that whenever the IA opponent tries to block or steal the ball from you, it rarely makes a foul. In the end, I feel that having good skills in this game are either useless by its randomness or shut off by its lack of balance."
9152,good.

It just seems like you gotta pay real money for everything you see, and I cannot even run a franchise mode without crashing (I have a 2080S and new computer) This is really disgusting what they can get away with.

9168,"This game is super buggy and incredibly slow. It is trying too hard to be like ""real-life basketball"" with a billion unskippable in-game cutscenes between quarters. The devs seem to think that gameplay is less important than how the game looks. While the game looks great and hyper-realistic, gameplay falls flat. The good graphics are just papering over the gaping gaps that this game has in its core gameplay, with issues regarding movement, passing and shooting/finishing animations. I bought this game during the 75% sale, and I would tell people to never buy it, even in the sale. Spend your money on a better game and not make the mistake i made!"
9169,It's 2k but on the computer. You will see great things! Players standing almost 8 inches tall with arms as long as trees! You will try hard to play a normal game yet something will always feel just a tiny bit off! You will waste hours and hours of you're time playing single player only to reliaze that it's legit faster to pay to win! BEST GAMBLING SIMULATOR OUT THERE! 10/10

I'm not complaining about the servers or hackers like most reviews I see, this game is full of bugs. Started out in mycareer,

Next update comes
game gets stuck on 69% (hehe)

9245,This Game is riddled with micro transactions that just sucks all the fun out of it. the best way to play many of the modes is to cheat. that is the only way i recommend playing this basic online only grind fest.

9247,"Aside from the movement being so slow the players look like they're running through water, the game is a good mixture of story and playing ball.

Like it a lot."

I play PC games for more than 20 years, and this is my biggest disapointement.
I have waisted weeks and months, years in playing this game to say that it is getting worst and worst year after year.
It supports cheaters and for online gaming this is a discrese, that 90% of the my carrier players in park are cheaters!!!

What is the point in building the player, grinding the experience and badges, play 3.000 games every year in park to compete and lost against nobody that bot the game day before, payed for cheat and after 3 games in park, he is ready to go against anyone?????

This is a commpleate waist of time and money.

I will never bay another 2k game for PC, and if cross-platform is enabled, then PS or Xbox shall be the same.

9272,"For such a minor update to gameplay and really just a roster update - there are far too many game breaking bugs to recommend this game - even now half a year after release.
2K inexplicibly got rid of 'Normalize Minutes' for MyGM mode, essentially destroying it.
Tried playing MyLeague instead, but there are league breaking bugs in that mode too.
If you want to play offline league modes you're S Out of Luck.

Typical NBA2K VC, gambling, unrealistic one-on-one dunk fests, in game purchase pushing, rushed & buggy product.
Big fan since the early 2000's, but Visual Concepts released a money making program and is moving farther, and farther away from the polished Basketball simulation that they built their name on."

9274,"I really enjoy this game, but it's a serious piece of shit. This game is absolutely littered with bugs that the devs will probably never fix. As far as positives go, I really enjoy how much customization the game allows. I have lovingly hand-crafted 3 custom teams, fit with custom logos that I uploaded to the 2k website, along with several custom players (for some reason you can only use created teams in MyLeague mode, but the fact that I can create teams at all is nice). I also enjoy the depth of the MyLeague mode; the flexibility of contract negotiations is terrific, I love that there's a coaching tree, there are really cool features like the NBA summer league. There are fantastic simulation options like automatic league expansion, rule changes, normalizing stats to sim minutes, the ability to control the rate at which the salary cap expands, the ability to control trade logic and player contract expectations... The commentary is really nice, the gameplay is good... really that alone is enough for me to thoroughly enjoy this game. However, the experience is totally ruined by the aforementioned bugs. I just spent a good half hour creating custom draft classes only to discover that the game wasn't actually saving them when I told it to, meaning my custom draft classes were lost. FMVs simply do not work, for some reason. The game crashes whenever I try to simulate past a certain date in one of my MyLeague files, meaning I cannot advance the franchise mode any farther, which really sucks because I dumped about 70 hours into that one franchise and now I can never continue it. For whatever reason, I am unable to download custom teams and add them to an offline MyLeague mode. However, I can upload them just fine to an online version of MyLeague, for some reason. In either case the menu for downloading teams does not function correctly and is nearly impossible to use as a result. Most of these problems likely do not occur on console, so if that is a viable option for you I do recommend playing there. One frustrating quirk about the game is that you can only add downloaded teams as expansion teams when creating a MyLeague file. You cannot overwrite any teams by inserting a downloaded team, which means that if you want to play as a custom team you must use an expansion team. Although you cannot overwrite current teams by downloading a team, you can still adjust the team's location, name, arena, logos and jerseys by hand. For example, I painstakingly created a custom team and uploaded it so that I could use the team again. When my MyLeague file stopped working, I wanted to restart and create a new MyLeague file. I would have liked to create a custom roster, then replace a current NBA team with my custom team's logos and jerseys. However, in order to do that I would have to remake the entire team by hand, as it is impossible to upload a custom team design onto an existing team. Another quirk about this game is that it's soundtrack is fucking terrible. I went and turned off at least half of the songs because they were just flat out god damn awful. 

tl;dr I really honestly enjoy this game, but bugs can make it frustrating and literally unplayable in certain instances. I assume there aren't as many bugs on console, so play there if that is a viable option for you.

Edit: For whatever reason I am also unable to use any logos when customizing. I am unable to change my team logo or add images to my jerseys as the game will just say that there was a problem saving the uniforms or the logos"

9277,Do not spend your hard earned money on this TRASH.  I remember the good times I had playing 2K when it first released on Dreamcast and also 2k11 on the PS4. This is not the 2K I remember.  You are required to play hundreds of hours or pay extra $$$ to have a slight chance of a decent shot on mycareer.  All the buttons seem to lag which throws off your momentum and shot.  The game often's switches into slow motion and stays that way until you exit and start over.  I have yet to enjoy anything this game offers.
9278,"The game's server is so bad that it's a hassle to connect to the Internet every time.Mt mode card bag also more and more rotten, more and more out of the faster, in order to circle the money by hook or by hook.Take an interesting pattern of mt and turn it into a piece of shit."
9279,"Absolute blast! Gameplay is smooth. Graphics are pretty good, but not so good that it hinders the game. I have a GTX 970, 4 GB RAM, and a mediocre processor, but I can still run it on ultra at a smooth 50-60 fps.

The graphics are good, though. Your myplayer is still a soulless tool with the appeal of a mcdonalds burger.

Even if you have a archetype player you want it does not even matter. When you reach ""legend"" level on mypark you gain +10 to all badges which makes any build the same and over powered. Your stats do not matter. Please watch - Joeknows youtube videos to see how bad the game really is. 

The game took more then 4 months to path to make it a decent game.  Big men with overall rating of 47 three pointer, green shots from the corner consistently. Due to the badge affect.

Servers. How much money 2k wasted and didn't even tried fixing the lag, stutters on mypark and proiam. Same poor performance every year. Nothing has changed. 

And I'm not even talking about cheaters in this game. Long legs, arms...

DO NOT wast money on this game. I've played enough to see what type of game this is. DON'T waist your time on this game.

This type of gameplay ruined what once was a best basketball game."
9329,"This game took my joy out of playing basketball. Now I have only bad memories connected to playing 2K. I have not played this game for more than 3 months and still feel the hatred from the cheesiness that this gave gives. I will not buy next years game just because i already know that it will suck all happiness of the day in bare minutes in the Park/Rec. I still remember how lockdowns drain contested deep threes to end the match while my slashing centre can't even make a layup with HOF badges.

2K are making games so buggy and unfinished that i was hoping to play EA NBA game when i heard of the possibility....EA. If you want to know how unrealistic tic basketball simulation game is just watch Joe Knows youtube. At first is seemed fun until all the work to make your attributes higher just stopped to matter. 2K made no steps to disable know glitches to cheese the creation of the player. The only time fixes are made is when people start to glitch VC.

Other point why no one should buy this game ever again. Servers. This game sold solely on the parks potential. You will struggle not just to find matches, but will lag and desync out of it when you play. All of the events just introduced more lag and issues. Server connection lost.

To end, this is the first game review i have wrote. Hopefully i will not buy  another basketball simulator."

The Gm mode has also been ruined by excessive restriction and the ""action point"" system is debilitating to the game play."
9336,"What I like about the game:
1. It was on sale when I bought it
2. It's Basketball

What I don't like about the game
1. Online multiplayer gameplay has very low fps even if I have a fast internet and an 8th gen intel i7/RTX 2070 Super build.
2. Screen tearing during online multiplayer 
3. You cant do ""skip to next appearance"" in my career unless you turn on vertical sync
4. Ai Team mates are deliberately forcing you to lose the game (my career)
5. During fast break when your team have the ball your ai teammate deliberately waits for the opponent to block him before attempting to dunk the ball (my career)
6. The ai opponent that guards you will be glue sticked to you during 4th quarter (my career)
7. A.i. teammates will become extremely stupid during clutch moments 

Conclusion: Don't even try to think of buying this game. The developers of this game hate you."
9337,so good
9338,My career is worth it. Yes they are money grabby but you get a lot for hall of fame difficulty and sponsors. Just play the regular season and you'll have more VC then you know what to do with once you start putting up 30 a game with 11 min quarters

9358,"It's just a re-skin and in no way offers a satisfying experience.  I even bought it at a discounted price ($20) and would not do it again.

After deciding to play it a bit, it can be sort of fun, but there are FAR too many bugs and issues with the game.

The game force quits all the time.  It can be in the middle of games (both season and playground games...and in the playground you just get replaced by an AI even if you log right back in...in season games you have to start the game over even if you've made it to the locker room talk post game).

Sometimes you just stop getting experience.  If you do, there is no fix.  You're just stuck.  You can create a new character, but you will have lost all the VC points you spent (not to mention time)."
9359,good
9360,Definitely has some bugs but if you can look past that and the shameless microtransactions then its a good game. Some of the mechanics are a little bit wonky. Get the game when it's 50% off and it's totally worth it.

9418,"Trash ass game. Unbalanced, takes no skill. We're talking about players in MyTEAM like DeRozan, Giannis, Marjonavic, Simmons shooting back to back to back to back threes with garbage releases (sometimes *OVER* defenders). Cheesy same moves used over and over again, shots taken from certain spots due to higher shot success rates and reaching in continuously, desperately hoping for a steal and fast break. Not to mention, the defense, let's get to the defense. Players going in for a free layup/dunk getting blocked out of nowhere by defenders standing a mile away, getting 90-100% smothered rates on what should be free shots when you outplay a defender but still getting contested, heavily due to poor coding in this game. Fouls often not called when they should be as well as fouls getting called when there is absolutely nothing happening. The developers of this game... they're ... clueless... talentless complete idiots who probably never even watch NBA or basketball in general. Making the game very family friendly where every noob has a chance to beat you with an OP team due to poor game design. Very, very pathetic. I don't care about the £25 spent on this game but if I could i'd 100% get a refund."

9467,"If you're a MyCareer player, like me, expect to be sorely disappointed by the quality of this game. 
The CPU players routinely make inexplicable decisions, especially on defense, and you will often find your team perfectly set defensively, only for one of your teammates to suddenly leave a 3-point shooter wide open because he wants to switch the match-up. This has been a problem since NBA 2k17, and I don't think it will change for a very long time.
While I appreciated NBA 2k19 for the quality of the collisions, NBA 2k20 has gone backwards massively, and you will often see players going through each other. For example, you will see a defender's hand go through the ball as he's trying to block a shot (without a block registering), or you might find yourself in perfect position to defend, only for the ball handler to go through you and find himself wide open in front of the basket.
The way in which the game plays is extremely unrealistic. All teams play exactly the same offensively, i.e. the ball handler gets the ball, he triggers some useless offensive motion, then sits around while the shot clock counts down and then shoots a contested jumper. Defensively there are only minor differences related to how they treat pick and rolls and mismatches.
Hall of fame difficulty, just like previous years, turns your teammates into secondary school calibre players, unable to make even the simplest plays, like pass to a wide open teammate, knock down open jumpers (which especially applies to top tier shooters), and sometimes refuse to shoot an open layup in front of the basket, instead preferring to make 2-3 useless pump fakes, during which the defender gets back into position, and then air-ball a contested layup. Conversely, the Hall of Fame CPU is moved into a Godlike tier. Do not be mistaken, this does not mean they are smarter, or more skilled. They still trigger useless offense, and run around with no purpose, however, they just make impossible plays. There is the classic example of the heavily contested three as the shot clock winds down, but even if that misses, you will find that the HOF CPU will dominate the boards, and will have a 99% chance of boxing out the defending rebounder. This applies regardless of who is fighting for the rebound, so a player like Jayson Tatum will somehow manage to push Andre Drummond out of the way and grab an improbable rebound, then dunk the ball like Shaq.
Instead of making the experience of playing on Hall of Fame fun and challenging, they just made it purely frustrating and unrealistic and I do not recommend anyone to buy this game, unless they wish to try other modes."

9496,"The last NBA I fully played was 2k13. I was a little hesitant on getting this game because of how negatively received the recent NBA 2K titles are.

The game itself is pretty OK from my opinion, doesn't stray too far from the classic 2K formula, new rosters, new players etc. etc. Most people complained about the pay to win multiplayer, so I stayed away from that and hence couldn't give any opinion for that matter. The Intro for career mode is quite neat in my opinion, though it feels a bit too long. I ran into a performance issue where the game was only able to maintain around 20-30 fps, and you have to do some tweaking to make it run properly. 

Overall, it's an okay game especially when you play it with someone else, just try and stay away from multiplayer if you can. I'd recommend it on sale, since I think it's quite expensive. If there's a mixed review button, I'd definitely press that."

Very dissapointed, I really thought  I could have fun just playin on my character but the thing is that in order to upgrade your skillset, you have to  buy coins to upgrade those attributes.

9529,"Presentation 7/10

Presentation gets a 7 for me. The main menu isn't anything to brag about. No hyped intro video (2012 was the best). The NBA Pregame show is kind of nice for the first 20 games you play then it just gets repetitive. Despite all of these, the game looks amazing.

Gameplay 8/10

Gameplay isn't actually too horrible. My only gripe is that when you're at least slightly contested, you brick almost any shot you take. Sure with the default sliders, its basically impossible to make a layup with Rudy Gobert within 5 feet of you but taking the time to tweak sliders makes the game better. I can't name off the top of my head anything that constantly ruins my experience. Just a couple of weird 2k bugs that show up every once and a while. 

MyCareer/Park 4/10

The myplayer builder is a great improvement in my opinion. It allows for so many different myplayer builds. The new badge system is nice because you actually get to pick your badges therfor create even more customization. The story at the beginning is alright but abruptly ends as soon as you start your rookie season. Summer League is pretty cool especially with the different commentators. After Summer League though, You're plopped into basically generic mycarrer. A couple endorsement cutscenes sprinkled in between but thats about it. The park is the same from last year. Same people heaving up bricks from half court, same people spamming steal with HOF pickpocket. Servers are laggy. In game items are way too expensive. Too reach 99 overall it's a GRIND without buying VC. I've been playing the same Mycareer for about 1 1/2 seasons and average about 10 minute quarters and i'm a 84 overall. 

Interesting side note: I play on a 144 hrtz monitor with v sync off. For what ever reason, I cannot skip bench time in mycareer unless i alt tab exactly 6 times. 

MyGM/MyLeague 4/10

These are basically the same modes in my mind. One has a little more artificial customization but overall they're both just franchise modes. Everything goes pretty smoothly until you get to the draft. You can either import a custom draft class or deal with the WORST DRAFT CLASSES I'VE EVER SEEN. These dudes come into the draft between the ages of 21 and 26. I put the draft class quality to 100 and still had this issue. To my knowledge there is no way of fixing this and my only fix is to either pick the youngest players or edit the player's age which puts my team at an advantage over the other teams. After a couple of seasons, you realize that everyone is at least a 76 overall and every team has 4-5 players over 82~ overall. Bum free agents want upwards of 20 mil a year and players' moral drops for no reason. They complain about loosing games when the team is 26-3 and they'll complain about playing time even though they are starting with good minutes. Expansion teams are decent but don't have any custom audio for cities. Your arm sleeve color is locked at bright blue unless you go to each individual player and change their colors.


MyTeam -/10

I've put about 3 hours into my team so i don't think its fair to assess it's rating. From my understanding it's about as grindy as mycareer and it's 2k's other cash cow. 

WNBA

Great improvement, I havent used it much but it's still a great feature. My only wish is to put WNBA players against NBA players

Conclusion

2k20 is one of those games you have to buy on sale to make it worth your money. Pretty fun most of the time but has some game breaking flaws in MyLeague/MyGM. Overall, 7/10, would break your ankles again.



"
9530,"I didn't buy this game for a long time due to the mixed reviews and talk of pay to win.

I grabbed it on sale and haven't been disappointed.

I may be in the minority, but i'm not interested in PVP, I wanted it for the MyCareer mode, and so far I haven't been disappointed. Starting out as a rookie and working your way up through the ranks of the NBA is meant to be tough, right? 
If you want to just jump straight into PVP you'll probably be disappointed. Even if you buy all the coins to max out your character, it seems designed to still require some grind to earn points and badges for levelling up."

So many cutscenes you have to wait 10-15 seconds to skip, forcing you to watch the end of every half even if the game isn't close.  The actual gameplay is pretty fun but doesn't really feel smooth and is janky with forced animations."
9549,The game does not allow you to set the camera angles permanently. You have to constantly reset the camera every single match. Overall layout is so bad. however loading speed has improved from previous games. Hope the next one is better.
9550,"First time playing it, the game was fine, just the same as console. Gradually, the game has gotten buggier, now it's basically unplayable. I continue to get scammed in myteam by auction house hackers and seemingly worse pack odds than console (could just be biased superstition but it definitely feels like it) and not to mention any multiplayer mode is near unplayable due to hackers. Don't even try to adapt to keyboard controls, they're terrible and my game does not save any custom key bindings. And that's only the PC-Specific problems, don't get me started on the gambling system, the money-hungriness, the intentional lagginess of 2ktv replays so you cant get free vc easy, and everything else in this garbage video game. Wait for 2k21 to come out, then wait another month to see if that's garbage too."

9574,"I have been playing MyCareer mainly and tried my first few park games, I hate that there is no Voice Chat, and ways to talk to people to create a group or make plays, and the online scene on pc is filled with hackers. BUT, the MyCareer mode if you play only the NBA is great, the people complaining about crashes is on there end... I have never crashed once playing 150+ hours of this, I crashed once when I tried to change some settings on my Nvidia Control panel, so one thing people can try is to go into their Nvidia settings and make sure that the NBA2k20.exe is set to restored or default settings, and see if that fixes the crash. NBA is on Pro level difficulty so the people that can only handle rookie mode, will get wrecked... my first week with the game, I was getting owned but persistence and learning the game mechanics made me avg a score of 60+ in any game on PRO difficulty that is, I am no Hall of fame level player by any means. The game is really amazing if you have the same skill level as me, because some of the matches were so heart pumping and realistic. I had a few games where I would be down 10 and the uphill battle to come out on top at the final 1 minute, was simply an AMAZING experience. I wish the PC community got more love, but the hackers make the online play impossible for me. Also, the console versions have a mode called MyPlayer Nation, I was looking forward to doing it on PC, but found out it is exclusive to the consoles version of the game only.

P.S The park mode got me fcked up in the beginning because they reset your camera, or the options for the camera is separate from your NBA game settings. To change the camera in the Park, you have to hit right on the D pad, and use LT, RT to cycle through the cameras. The park feels really weird to me compared to NBA and MyCourt.

I would only buy this game on sale... I would never pay full price... This is a cash grab company and video game... everything in the game, you will notice that they try to maximize the amount of money they can get out of you. EVERYTHING COST VC, Upgrading your character, buying animations, clothing, and emotes. I understand spending VC for cosmetics and animations, but these animations also affect the gameplay as well... there is no balance in this game, if a player does their research to create an OP build you can save a lot of time, money and frustration... anyone new that picks up this game and creates their own build is at a disadvantage... I wasted my entire 100k VC from the legend edition on my first character, just to find out I made the most retarded dude in the world LOL. But hey, the games still really fun to play, I am just bad online. Definitely worth the 33$ I paid for the Legend edition. I calculate each Dollar, by the hour that I play a game for. (Similar to when you are going to an Arcade and spending a dollar to play a game)"
9575,"It keeps crashing. Until they fix this, I am not gonna touch it again. Spoils my mood for the day"
9576,"game baned me for modding offline and then doesnt ban peole that hack in the park that are 8ft tall like tf 
"
9577,"The game is TERRIBLE on PC. There are so many glitches I lost count. Even the story mode scenes had missing visuals where the screen would just turn green.  If you want to play 2k, just get it for a console. This was a waste of money that I regret."
9578,"good
"
9579,vc
9580,TRASH GAME. CANT EVEN ACCESS MyCAREER!
9581,"This 2k game is the worst 2k game I've played, even NBA live 19 is better than that. When I play Myluege in every match its the same pattern, I lead with 20 points in the first and the second quarter, then in the 3rd, 4th the cpu ai gets unnatural superpower and hit every shot and you can't do anything against it, in the same game period my players hit nothing.
Than the players do unnatural moves. They can't catch a simple passor pass it into a direction where i don't want that pass to be, the defense lets player through easily."
9582,"This game is dogshit lmao
"
9583,Exceptional game :)) Like me
9584,"laggy af, slow simulation in mygm and myleague, mygm is trash, mycareer is stale."
9585,You need a good pc to have best experience
9586,"please god please fix this slomo bullshit in MyCareer. it bogs the game down so bad it becomes unplayable. it could be the good basketball game we were once used to, if you just paid more attention to it and fixed it."
9587,fun but but hard to grind for
9588,"Good game for real. :D
"
9589,ddf
9590,great game
9591,t
9592,Why can't you fix bugs from previous year? And why you make game more stupid every year?
9593,Very slow gameplay
9594,"its good
"
9595,"Its a very good game, except for all the lags while playing online and stuff, it also uninstalled itself, idk how"
9596,Like this review to show 2k your displeasure with them not bringing next gen to PC for 2k21. This company shows no respect to PC players.
9597,To upgrade the player you need to collect the coin by playing a match. Its so fcking hard. Why not you make like madden. Every training have chances to upgrade your attributes. I'm kind of regret after I buy this game. Its so not worth to buy with that kind of expensive price. This is my first and last time to buy this idiot NBA game.
9598,The game is pretty bad to be honest but its the only thing we got
9599,gthrhrhrhhrhr
9600,No
9601,"""hmm position lock is finally here for 2k20? alright looks like i finally play myteam""
>PG giannis card
>C lebron card
>PG thon fucking maker card
get rid of contracts like Madden Ultimate Team did and add position lock I am begging"
9602,really good game but it crashes and for some reason my core i5 nvidia gefore gtx 1660 max Q has weird graphics like its on low resolution even though it says that everything is on ultra
9603,The game is great>
9604,ye
9605,Never in my life have i experienced a lower effort port.
9606,dont play online
9607,its an honest fun game. It has only crashed once or twice through out the 45 hours ive played it so that hasnt been a problem.
9608,assman
9609,"My player is lacking a little in story, but overall a fun game was nice to get back into sports games with this one, but VC does determine how fast you progress, so be prepared to pay to win lol."
9610,There are a lot of hackers but its fun to play with friends.
9611,very fun yes
9612,I dont understand why people hate this game so much. I didnt play 2K since 2018 and I bought 2K20 - I think this game is dope. I am very satisfied. Definitely recommend!
9613,"great experience so far, loving the myCareer mode!"
9614,EPIC BALLING
9615,"There is no rookie mode so unless you have 60+ hours a week to waste to learn how to be a ""Pro"" which is ""Just as easy as Rookie"" don't waste ANY money on this piece of garbage. I have a maxed character and he's useless."
9616,"When bored and no friends to play with, you can either watch TikTok for 15hours or play this game :)"
9617,it good game
9618,"I really enjoy this game, I am playing in my career and its realy fun"
9619,hi
9620,good mf game
9621,good
9622,"bjk
"
9623,How the hell can you NOT play a career mode offline? There is NO reason for them to require an internet connection. I have spent hundreds of dollars (if not over $1k) on NBA 2K games over the years. I can tell you with 100% certainty this is the last time they take a dime from me until this is fixed.
9624,2K gets worse and worse every year
9625,give me some free vc
9626,Best game ever.
9627,"PLEASE MONITOR ONLINE CHEATERS OF THIS GAME PARTICULARLY ON MYTEAM MODE. MY OPPONENT JUST MADE A QUIT HACK LEAVING ME ON THIS GAME HANGING WHILE IM ON A LEAD THUS MAKING HIM FORCE ME TO RESTART THE GAME LEADING TO A LOSS FOR ME! IT'S RIDUICULOUS KNOWING HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS GAME. AGAIN, PLEASE MONITOR ONLINE CHEATERS ON MYTEAM MODE AND PENALIZE SUCH VIOLATORS."
9628,good work
9629,"This game is fun even if you are not a basketball fan. Just don't buy it full price, wait for a sale. 
Few bugs there & there not really optimized on PC but playable."
9630,GOOD GAME. ADDICTING. WFG (Worth For Grind)
9631,This is so cool
9632,"AWSOME
"
9633,very niiceeee
9634,"Don't listen to all of the other reviews saying servers are trash. The only issues I have had is with finding a MyTeam match but other than that I always find others to play against. In Quick Play, MyPark etc. I have found opponents."
9635,"love it
"
9636,The game is good now lol
9637,"A bit ass but fun
"
9638,"not worth $60 but if you find it for sale and love basketball, its very enjoyable"
9639,my name jeff
9640,game is the same as every other 2k i never got a confirmation email for my account so every time i re open i have to enter all of my credentials again and cant find a tab to send said email again which is typical so whatever by if you want a game the developers dont care about because they will just try again next year
9641,"So glitchy and bad, its easy to see no care has been put into it, it´s a rip off of 2k19 but with more bugs.... NBA live needs to make a comeback"
9642,"The only way I could possibily recommend you this game, is if you catch it on sale for $20 or less. The game is damn near carbon copying from 2k19. Just updated rosters, the graphics don't even look that different, but that is to be expected in late generation games. Seriously though, if someone blindfolded me and said to guess which 2K I'm playing from 2019 or 2020, the only way I would find out from the menu's is the soundtrack. 

There are redeeming qualities to this game, however. The reason I do not recommend the game at full price is because its basically a money farm. You pay $60 for a barely changed game, that attempts to farm your wallet for VC. But I recommend getting it on sale, solely for the mods. There are amazing modders out there doing the work that 2K refuses to, and makes the game worthwhile, fun, and playable. I just wish we could mod better AI. Think hard about this decision. Probably more worthwhile waiting for the next one."
9643,too many hacker which make the game not fun
9644,I hate it
9645,better than 19
9646,yuh
9647,trash server
9648,"Fun, Good Graphics, Way better then 2k19, Short But Good Intro Story, All Around Fun With Friends
**8/10**"
9649,idk
9650,"ashhhhhhhh
"
9651,very cool game!!!
9652,"Overall a pretty good game. It has it's pros and cons. If you're a basketball/NBA fan you'll probably enjoy it from the get go, the gameplay is decent and I very much enjoy MyTeam and MyCareer. The only issue I can think of is that the game is fairly pay to win unless you really want to grind before going onto MyPark. The game may sometimes crash but in my experience of 110 hours as of writing this, it has crashed about 3 or 4 times. It has moments where you question the physics but a lot of games do nowadays."
9653,hard af
9654,"fun
"
9655,Good game...could be better
9656,"Tried this and deleted after one hour. Horrible game.

Last one I played quite lot was NBA 2K18, it felt much more smoother on PS4 than this on very capable gaming computer.

"
9657,"I didn't want to believe the bad reviews, but after buying this game ON SALE I am convinced that any positive review is a FAKE, FROM A BOUGHT ACCOUNT. This game actually looks like a Playstation 2 game. I like 2k a lot, but what they are doing to pc players is disgusting!"
9658,.
9659,this is the good game
9660,fun game
9661,a vrehehwrhrh RGrhg 3rhr

9671,best basketball game
9672,horrible perfect description
9673,good
9674,"I understand 2k on PC can be bad for a lot of people, but I haven't experienced any noticeable issues yet. Probably cause I haven't played online yet lol"
9675,"Too Much Hackers, Payed 60 Bucks For This Just To Be Bad, I Wish I Could Get A Refund"
9676,it is the best game the world has gave to humanity
9677,"Its so bad, Thank god I got this while it was on 60 % sales... The sound doesn't work...the graphic is as bad as shiiit. Im using brand new laptop but wow...This game failed so badly on pc don't even get it while its on sales... just WOW....."
9678,veri gud gam i play bal and win weri pro
9679,"I'm not a big fan of 2K or any other games with lots of microtranscations. That being said, I bought this game while it was on sale as the NBA/NCAA seasons were over and I needed my basketball fix. I've had the game for just over a week and have 18 hours played already. The MyCareer mode is phenomenal- almost all of my gametime has been spent in that mode. I did have to buy an XBOX controller in order to properly play the game on PC, but it was well worth my money. Hopefully I can become an NBA all-star before the quarantine ends. 10/10 would recommend to any basketball or sports fans."
9680,Amazing game.
9681,"Good game,but offline mode. Dont buy for park you will be dissapointed!"
9682,"one of the worst basketball game in the past 20 years !!!! don,t waste your money ! most importantly, don't waste your time !!!!!!!"
9683,"im going baby on baby 
u"
9684,"Game is so damn broken! Seriously, playing over 60 FPS is not possible due to bugs and glitches (like taking 10 sec to skip the time when being subbed out in my player, or the constant crashing). Sometimes the sound wont work if you change the input (from speaker to headset midgame) until you restart the game...and dont let me get started on the multiplayer part. You have to invite your friend to your hood and THEN AGAIN to your squad lol like why do i have to invite someone 2 times to join my game. And im not even talkin about the times we failed to connect to a game cause one friend was glitching out and disconnecting all the time. 

Besides that, the Park hasnt changed, the gameplay is a bit diffrent from 2k19 and the progression is much better imo....it still forces you to buy vc if you start (like me) in 4 months after release and want to play with your mates...

Would not recommend this game to anyone. 2k is exploiting their fanbase for years now"
9685,bad but good
9686,"very very good games
but the vc/coins is suck
this game no vc 
because this game have vc
i give 7.5/10"
9687,"If you are not a die hard fan of the NBA2K series then you will enjoy this game, fun for casual or competitive play."
9688,its fun if you dont care about the ingame currency.
9689,Worst game of nba2k series!
9690,"if ur IQ is higher than ur shoe size dont buy this game.(mine isn't)
-Shitty fucking servers(u will disconnect every 10-30 minutes)
-uncountable bugs
-highly pay to win(u can still get their level but it will take ur whole month)
"
9691,"After playing for 18 hours I booted up my game and it sent me back to the main menu of steam!!!!!!!!!
It won't let me play anymore and it is not fair because I payed good money for this game that could've spent on something else.....please fix this."
9692,"As per usual, 2K continues to be one of the worst games on a year to year basis. The game continues to stray further from a quality product and make baffling choices on how to ""improve"" their game. If you even want to consider buying this game, get it on a console. It's only worth playing with friends and even then it's a genuine toss-up. There are hackers littering every lobby in MyPARK and making it impossible to enjoy games. The badge system this year is a great improvement but does not make up for all of its pitfalls. Even worse, the game is so focused on online play and it is extremely difficult to enjoy MyCareer in an offline fashion. The Pay-to-Win aspect has been toned down this year but you can just win with hacking so whatever. I don't follow MyLeague that much but I assume they haven't changed much. Simply put, something massive needs to happen to improve this game. They continue to put out a low-effort product and get rewarded."
9693,"solid
"
9694,"Throughout the years 2k has remained as a fun game for the boys to play. Although because of the cash hungry developers, buggy gameplay, and plethora of hackers, it is a game which is not worth $60. If it was $10 i would recommend but unfortunately they only put the game on sale once they are about to release the next one. 3/10"
9695,"Game is so buggy, sometimes it takes i play the same game over 4 or 5 times, whether the sim doesn't work, or in mid game, game crashes for no reason, or when im going on bench and starts to slow down for the sim button to appear it just stops and doesn't respond anymore. Overall its been out for so long and still so buggy and hard to play through, I'm just a MyCareer player and this is the bugs the present, i cant even imagine what they got on everything else."
9696,Good game
9697,Good
9698,"its  okay not bad but the server need to be fix a lot of bug and connection is bad
"
9699,"To describe how poorly made this game is I will tell you my experience with it.

I start the game. I go to collect some fish from the beach. Fish hitbox is finnicky so I end up accidentally drinking seawater instead. Contract indigestion. Pick up some seaweed, it says 'boil with some water to get an indigestion-curing tea'. I make the tea. The tea description says 'cures the common cold'. I drink it anyway, hoping it would work. It doesn't.

I go into the storage area and two enemies appear. The combat is legitimately terrible but I was willing to give it a shot. The game freezes while I'm in combat, and I have to close and re-open the game. When I do, my character has died and is in town again. All my food has rotted.

I leave town. The first quest has you find 150 silver or a Tribal Favor or you will lose your house. I go south and eventually find an injured man on a beach there. I heal him and he thanks me and says I have done a great deed so he will go to town and get me a Tribal Favor.
I head back to town. As I'm walking up the path to my house, I get a quest update. The timer just ran out, so I lost my house. Did that guy I saved not make it back to town? I go to talk to the leader. It turns out he did make it to town. I did indeed have a Tribal Favor. But I needed to be there in person to 'apply it'. She says, 'If you can't accomplish something, you need to accept the consequences.'

I don't know if I should blame this on the bug that froze the game and caused me to die and waste a day, or the fact that I spent too much time trying to cure my disease because the item descriptions are wrong, or if it's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game design. Whatever the case, if I can have this bad of an experience in the opening act it does not bode well for the rest of the game."
9700,"Every year I play nothing but MyLeague/MyGM has every year I love the game as much as the last. I can't speak to any of the other modes, but 2K20 is a great basketball game."
9701,"small hindi company, full of cheaters, retards with 10 meters arms unbanned , but banning people who is not using all 99 and do not cheating, they just care all about the money, fckin cunnts"
9702,crashes with no fix

9711,j
9712,you can play basketball in this game
9713,If you want to play a game where the teams AI becomes statues instead of ACTUALLY PLAYING DEFENSE then the MyPlayer carrier is the place for you.
9714,recommended if your pc meets the game requirements
9715,I don't know where all the negativity game from in this game I just got the game today and I am absolutely loving it all the mechanics work to perfection besides the fact it took me 30 tries to download the game. Overall this is an amazing game and I highly recommend it
9716,"Once again, 2K is always a fun game to play with friends, however I just cannot give it a rec at the price tag of $60 because it feels like it costs less to produce the game itself. Really fun, but just buggy and inconsistent. Wait till it goes on sale for $15-30 and then buy."
9717,"the whole experience of this game is amazing! but its very badly designed/put together, that this in game update that it has to download, wont even download! therefore im unable to play my career and to play online with friends.. which is mainly the reason why i bought this game... if ur unlucky such as me id request a full refund."
9718,this game is filled with stupid time fillers that don't add any depth to the game at all. NBA Live 2005 is a better game than this trash
9719,this game is terrible dont buy
9720,trash game
9721,gf
9722,yes
9723,gud gem
9724,"You don't need to buy this game every year, and the micro transactions are pretty gross, also you have to watch commercials."
9725,Only good thing about this game is the quit button
9726,"sh1t game, dont buy. 2k needs competitior."
9727,this game is fu**ing amazing!!!!
9728,"Probably one of the worst games i have ever spent this much time on. The servers are completely horrible, online play always has this really annoying lag which u can get used to but shouldn't even exist and the matchmaking is just horrible because there is none u just walk in where u want to play and u play with random people regardless of how well they play. Unless u are a fan of the NBA and u see no other bball game alternatives do not buy this completely bugged game."
9729,"Let me preference this by saying I absolutely hate this game. Its pay to win, nothing makes sense, and its very buggy. But despite all of that I still come back every year spend my money on vc and continue to play. I have a problem."
9730,"Worst game ive ever played, full of bugs and crashes , i regret every cent i spent on this garbage.
I do not recomend this shitty ass game.
Thank You 2k :)"
9731,great game would highly reccomend
9732,MyLeague goes hard
9733,"this game is fire
"
9734,good
9735,My first NBA game. I love it. I play a lot and got a kick out of playing the legacy teams. Get this game if you're a fan you won't be disappointed. Many different levels of play for hours of fun.
9736,"Ever since a new update, the game just crashes, and then I can't even force close it. Have to restart my whole system. I've checked files and any other fixes, but it's just a waste of time."
9737,nice game
9738,There are more cheaters here
9739,To expensive lmaooooooooooooo
9740,"Now the serious issue is solved for me so i have to take back the negative feeling, so i''l return to my first opinion

My Team is the best feature ever seen in a sports game, and it's absolutely, ABSOLUTELY fair based on single player mode, i don't know  how it works in multiplayer and personally i don't care because you have years to spend in single player base and dynamic challenges to fill the album. Great, MASTER work, this and Draft Day Sports Pro (and College) Basketball are what a basketball purist needs for the last days of mankind!!


I recommended  this game after 72 hours of play but I feel the need to update my opinion on it. I think that the company does not respect its customers at all, firstly because it continues to sell it and secondly that it has completely abandoned the existing ones. The best feature of the game, MyTeam is completely broken. No matter how many times you beat your opponents in Domination, the win is not recorded and therefore you can not proceed to complete the challenges and collect the cards. 200 stars of Domintation, remain broken for months. So after a thousand hours of play, 2650 cards that I collected spending a lot of money and endless hours on the auction house, I am forced to stop. They could clearly announce before someone bought it that as soon as the new version of the game comes out, the old one is for throwing away ...... Instead, they continue to sell it for 50 euros!"
9741,"fun but gameplay is gay
"
9742,"Err okay, MyTeam is pointless, but MyCareer is so f*ckin good"
9743,"The guidance is not friendly to the keyboard, the game know you are using a keyboard but still use the key on controller in the guidance."
9744,2k20 is awesome!!
9745,Game cant run cause it wont update
9746,"NICE
"
9747,"I only play MyCareer, and that's the only thing they get right in the game. Online park games are unplayable since I have a 1 sec input lag, but in campaign games it works with no input lag. I'm not even touching MyTeam based on everything I've heard from the community.

MyCareer good, everything else bad"
9748,"pros: its a good game overall, if you don't already have one and wanted one then it's great! Always better to wait till these games are on special though.

cons: bro y'all need to fix kobe's look"
9749,it ight
9750,nice game
9751,you know its a pretty good game
9752,crashes alot
9753,"Awful game. The company is awful, and they take forever to respond with help when you most need it. Game is a copy of NBA 2k19, but there is a lot of things wrong with the game overall. Not worth the money."
9754,"The game has a wonderful story line, however come to the mechanics of the game, I felt the controls were poor and clunky and nothing was really clear. Not sure bout this one..."
9755,IT GOOD
9756,Nice
9757,AMAZING
9758,Stupid game
9759,good graphics
9760,najaca igrica kupite svi
9761,"Better than nothing. Not much difference from 2019 appart from new roosters.
Saddly there is no alternative."
9762,"Great gameplay, IF you can actually get to the gameplay. It's impossible to sit down and try to play online with or without your friends, with the constant failing updates the imense bugs and AWFUL servers. It's incredibly frustrating.
Buy this game if you just want to play offline, otherwise its wasted money."
9763,"dis game is shit. its like they copy paste the previous version.
"
9764,"Career got boring after the interlude.

After entering the NBA, the story and the cut scenes completely stopped. The story is what captures your audience. It hooks your players, motivates them to perform better, and immerses them beyond surface level.

The story simply ended too quickly. Felt empty after the interlude, left me wanting more. And don't even get me started on how difficult it is to make shots and score this year.

What a letdown."
9765,Ok JUST A COPY OF 2K19
9766,"awesome game to play while at home during corona lol
"
9767,][
9768,Servers are really bad fuck servers
9769,"EVERYTHING!
"
9770,"If you love NBA then this is for you. Mycareer is by far the best part, i love the new story line each year. Yes some aspects of the game are geared towards trying to get you to part with your hard earned cash but you can also just grind until you get there naturally.
Roll on 2K21"
9771,"Bought it on sale and I think it's worth the money. Yes there are many microtransactions, but this is the best basketball on the market, myteam and mycareer are very fun to play and can give you a bunch of hours of fun."
9772,I cannot save jersey and create my own team this game is trash
9773,"Cool online gameplay. A lot of stuff to do
"
9774,ITS AIGHT
9775,nice
9776,"Game doesn't launch, 2k support centre does not respond to tickets.
DO NOT BUY."
9777,nice
9778,adasd
9779,dank
9780,"Best basketball game on the market IMO but i wouldn't of bought it not on sale. Lots of incentive to pay for micro-transactions (skill boosts, player clothes, etc). Basically unplayable without a controller and can be somewhat laggy at times. Also why is a sports game 80gb lol? 

MyCareer is pretty addictive tho 

Don't buy unless its 70% or more off."
9781,beacause thats game error error terus
9782,good game
9783,does anymore need to be said its nba 2k no matter the year its 2k haha
9784,Its a good game for a baller although there are some glitches in the game that we would like to fix
9785,nice
9786,The online match is a piece of s**t. Players move like 3-year old baby and you can never make a close-range shot or a lay-up that even I can do in reality.
9787,Amazing Game!
9788,it eates poop

Amazing, big ups for devs"
9794,
9795,I mean I bought it because I love 2k and don't have a console. If there were more people online it would be a lot better. MyTeam is terrible because of MT sellers that sky rocket prices for players. MyCareer on the other hand is a lot of grinding and fun imo.
9796,hm
9797,GHJGHJ
9798,Unplayable. Crashes constantly during cutscenes in myplayer mode.
9799,"It`s allways lagging,  it cost too much.There is no logic at playing this game"
9800,"this game is shit. I play 2k basketball since 2008, its getting worse since 2k15"
9801,The best nba game franchise ever. though on pc there are bugs galore.
9802,Waste of money
9803,"This is the most amazing game I've ever played. I think everyone should give it a shot, its just like life, life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what youre gonna get so might be a vibey time or might be a shitty time its just up to the gamer. but this game cool. should copppp."
9804,its ight
9805,NBA 2K is always a great single player experience in my opinion. I haven't had much experience with the multiplayer because multiplayer is only as good as the community playing the game. I would get this game for the mods and single player experience.
9806,frustrating
9807,errything
9808,eh
9809,yes
9810,`The game plays well...liked it!

9812,"In core its decently fun, but the shitty and annoying controlls, combined with audia bugs and frequent crashes just makes it a big no. And i personally play with a ps4 controller conected with a cable and everytime i move the cable even a little it freezes the game and i have to alt+f4.

Fix your game 2k, very annoying

Edit: Still dont work at all, crashes, bugs, cant update the game and poor peformance, very bad experience"
9813,2K is pay to win for sure but it's possible to grind. It doesn't take much to be a god in your MyCareer games and at the park just play to your strengths it's not that hard. Everyone whines and complains because they expect to be good right away. I don't like the business tactics for this game but it's not impossible to get good without $$$.
9814,fun game

9819,i liked the way that the game was played but it does sometimes delete your players.

9833,"This game will not run on my PC.

My game cannot run for more than 5 minutes without a CTD (Crash to desktop) and doesn't give me any error code so I can even attempt to fix it.

I have more than enough processing power to run this game.

I don't know how to fix this and it appears that this is unfortunately a common issue in the PC community."

9835,fun
9836,"Once again 2k puts out a product that they work more on the production side rather than the developmental side of things. Put all their money into getting the Stars the talk about NBA 2K and don't fix bugs when it relates to player movement, layups are bugged always, and their MyPlayer system is rigged into coaxing you to purchase their version of bit coin, oh sorry VC, to improve your performance rather than fundamentals and actual skill and IQ reading the plays. They manufacture gamescripts where they purposefully reduce your ability to play in situations based on IQ and skill and force you into this feeling that you need to spend money to improve your player, or your build. I don't know why I continue to see the NBA stamp their brand on an inferior product like this, just like Shaq and that stupid ass Shaq-Fu basketball game from the 90's. When there was NBA Live, at least 2K was forced to compete to show that they had a better product, whether it was facial and anatomical rendering that pushed the industry, or a shot mechanic or dynamic mechanic such as use of the joystick to perform acrobatic layups. Don't get doped into supporting this company until they work on the bare bones of this game that are flawed to deep fault. Nice job publicizing this by buying D-wade and other marquee talent to sign off on this when its broken."
9837,What a piece of shit don't buy this game 1/10 experience
9838,Unbelievably buggy besides being a game that is not fun to play

9840,Worst NBA 2K i ever played.Worst Server.
9841,good
9842,it is the worst online game i have ever played. so laggy. cant play anything unless you want to play offline against cpu.. and even then it has a 40% chance of crashing
9843,"save yourself the money and get anything else if u wanted to play this game online its almost impossible without breaking your controller, the game lags non stop and if you're lucky to get into a game you will disconnect within 3mins save yourself the money and go play club penguin u will have a lot more fun"

9883,"First of all, why am I playing? I miss the NBA man.... 

The 90 million cut scenes are cringe worthy and it won't let you skip annoying scenes or movements until like 10-15 seconds into the clip/animation. No way to turn off ""post score camera paning"". No way to change your POV in practice. Not player friendly. Might as well put un-skippable ads at this point.... During drills the helpers will pass the ball 5 feet out of the spot you're supposed to shoot in... man it's so bad. You can pick your player jersey.... but you can't see what the other team is wearing so you have a potential to pick matching jerseys....

Also, note this game is super heavy on grind early on. The game wants you to do horrible. if you stick with it, you'll be able to drop 40 points a game like 25 games in, but it's still a pain, and you have to force it... I cut to the basket in the 2nd half.

If you go off and get like 40 pts, 10 assists, 3 steals, 3 blocks, 10 rebounds.... your next enemy will play like Kobe regardless of their overall. You will also be constantly guarded off the ball and won't be able to move. It's so ridiculous lol. 70 overall matchup shouldn't drain everything.

Unless you perfect time every shot, you will miss them. Badges make the difference. Make a 99 overall character and don't give him a single badge. He will miss every shot. Overall doesn't really matter for your player. 

The story is 3 hours, really annoying, and takes forever.

I mean it's obvious that the company remakes the same game every year because they have no competition, but this one blatantly says, ""I don't care about the player experience. What are you going to do about it?"""
9884,amazing game
9885,"It is just NBA 2k20 on pc. The AI is a little stupid sometimes, but no crashes yet. Make sure you meet the spec requirements before you purchase"

9888,
9889,VERY NICE
9890,BBB
9891,better online game play than other previous 2k games i have played
9892,"this game is the most shit game you will ever play.. there are times the computer will just want you to lose and takes the entire game out of your hands and makes it impossible for you to win. the game is actual just garbage.. super unresponsive. you get caught in the shittiest animations where the cpu never gets put into any animations. just an over all shit game. so bad. i really think they need to just fire the entire staff all 100% of people who worked on this game and hired like toddlers really. they would do a better job this company should be ashamed of themselves really they should they dont give 1 fuck about anyone who plays it. all they care about is money all they want is to see the consumer spend as much money as possible.. they are charging 60 dollars for a game that has been out for a year and the pre order for the new game is already out imagine changing the same amount of money 2 games one being the new gen game.. lmao this company and most gaming companies are a joke and take advatage of people who love to just play a video game for a living. everything about this game is a fucking joke. the story the AI the player online. this game has nothing good about it and if i was an actual player i would be embarrassed to be shown on the cover of this shit game
"
9893,"Several youtubers recommended this game for myCareer, so I bought it on sale.  I have only really played myCareer in the past.  Nicely, the Amazon Prime Twitch reward is no longer active, so you can forget that deal at this point.  Played for a bit and I must say, this 2K is garbage.  Feels like you are in quicksand, the player development is really slow, you are forced to do the coach's drills during practice (not sure for how long), and the game mechanics seem very laggy and unbalanced.  GG, thinking about asking for a refund."
9894," I have only played MyCareer and a bit of MyLeague to this point but i have just seen hackers walking through the park.  MyLeague and MyCareer are basically the same as on Console, just slight differences, while MyTeam and Park are just filled with hackers, bugs, and Microtransactions.  If you think you are going to play a lot of Park and MyTeam, then i do not recommend.  If you think you are going to play a lot of MyCareer and MyLeague, I would recommend."
9895,"Not the best, but not the worst. This game is still fun and very addictive to play rather its MyCareer or just quick play, I'm having fun. Comparing it to the other 2K games is stupid, not every game every year can outdo prior games- the series is great!"
9896,yee
9897,"Garbage
"
9898,enjoy playing my league and myteam
9899,"Was debating buying game because of other negative reviews, couldn't resist though because  I am an avid basketball fan and now that the NBA season is delayed, I couldn't think of anything better than this to play while school is dismissed. There is a game breaking bug in my career that still hasn't been patched yet, but to get around it you just have to alt-tab multiple times and it will bybass it. Overall great game and very fun to play, even better if you love basketball."
9900,i mean i would recommend but the frames are pretty bad if you have a low end computer but yeah still a good game
9901,"the AI is quite poor, especially in trading logics. This has a feeling of the arcade not of simulation game"
9902,Amazing Graphics with Realistic Gameplay
9903,fun but i have many drop fps :(
9904,this game is very really fun and there is many things to do such as a my carrer of your own person or simulating years un my league or you can assemble a good team with legends on it in myteam
9905,"Starts great, ends up you being unable to ""check in"" after appearing on the bench when you FINALLY gets to the league. I tried re-installing the game, didn't work. I've researched a bit, seems like I'm not the only one, there's TONS of reddits about you being stuck on the bench and unable to check in. There aint no solution, we just have to pray for an update soon wich fixes it."
9906,"If your playing on computer its so fun same with PS4, But the Simulator sometimes breaks just restart the game or your computer and you all good.

Otherwise 10/10 game no lag no bugs just fun! 

Who else has the really weird Sim? it takes 5 min fr."
9907,It is a really cool game i highly recommend it to anybody who is interested in this type of game

9909,aa
9910,"GOOD.
"
9911,oh my god! How did it cut prices so much .
9912,Bought the game for the sale cause i figured why not and dont buy it. Its probably the worst game ive ever played and i used to LOVE nba2k.
9913,this game is fine the only thing is the game is like in slow motion and i really do not now why
9914,"yooo add cross play even if its private matches say like, i host and my friend joins,  i wanna vs him simple"

9918,"great game!
the best i've played. It did crash a few times but i managed to fix it easily"
9919,"Got it on a 67% off sale and still not worth it. 

The whole game reeks of desperation to squeeze every last cent out of it's player base while offering nothing worth while over 2K19, Having a computer that can run Arkham Knight on Ultra with 4k, and then sitting through 5 second lags between successful shots and 'replays' is unforgivable of a supposed AAA title.

Stop the greed."
9920,I mean its 2K
9921,"1.the server is probably somewhere in a mountain,there's like 1 sec delay when moving your character,doesnt matter which mode
2.this is my first time and i will never BUY another 2k game,they didnt told me that i need to confirm my email adress in order not to lose mycareer account . and guess what? they deleted my account and told me that ""next time confirm your email"" without even telling me in the first place to confirm my email
3. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU WANNA PLAY MYCAREER (WHICH IS THE LEAST WORST MODE IN THIS GAME BCS IT DOESNT HAVE ANY LAG)"
9922,"no gameplay improvements in MyCareer.

Teammates still miss 99% of their Shots, won't shoot on open Lanes, do weird animations under the Basket, they yell to switch but don't switch so you get the negative Grade, they don't rotate on D, you are still being blocked constantly to leave the Pain or just trying to walk somewhere and so on and on and on.

9928,This game is horribly optimized and buggy as shit during myleague mode. I didn't think it was possible to have a title from a major developer be more buggy than Madden but here we are
9929,"Good game kids who cant ball hate it cause you cant cheese as much anymore stay mad hoe.
"
9930,"kinda glitchy, and if you get the slowmo glitch in mycareer put your refresh rate to 60 and vsync on (ikr sorry).
but its better than 2k18 which was my last one, and it has my favourite shot meter from 2k17 so whatever its ai.

edit: EVERY GAME ON PARK WILL BE WITH A CHEATER, MOST LIKELY A MASCOT 7'3 ALL AROUND SCORER WHO CAN SPEED BOOST. AND GUESS WHAT! NO ANTI-CHEAT, NO FUCKING REPORT BUTTON!!!!!!!!!!! LUCKILY THESE KIDS ARE ALL SEWER WATER AT THIS GAME BECAUSE THERE IS A SERVER ON DISCORD PROVIDING ALL THESE LOSERS WITH A PAID CHINESE CHEAT FOR FREE!

THIS GAME IS GARBAGE, I WILL ONLY PLAY THIS UNTIL 2K21 COMES OUT AND I CAN PURCHASE ON XBOX WHERE THERE IS ACTUALLY PLAYABLE GAMES AND SKILL MATTERS MORE THAN THE AMOUNT OF VIRUSES YOU DOWNLOAD ONTO YOUR HARD DRIVE."
9931,fun
9932,"Buy this game if you just want to do MyCareer or MyLeague, just wait on sale like it is now. MyTeam is a waste of money though, so don't get it."
9933,"on pc this game is alot more interactive as a user, not only do you get the regular game modes, but you get the options to get mods if you find the game stale yourself. I recomend and give it a good 8/10"
9934,this game the besttt 100%
9935,Amazing. MyCareer Has been fun even though my team is 7 15 right now

9937,yes
9938,yes
9939,"If all design issues that people mention here are not enough to discourage you from buying, the technical issues should. The game keeps on crashing during matches. 2k support keeps on talking about toning down your settings to match your hardware or updating drivers, but it's honestly just bullshit. I am far above the recommended settings, have the latest drivers and still experience frequent crashes. From reading people's feedback it seems like these issues are the most prevalent among Nvidia users.

I could live with crashes if the progress was auto saved during games, but it's not. So be prepared for them to happen at the worst possible time. For me they happen usually in the 4th quarters of really good games."
9940,it was like
9941,"This game crashes so often, I only have another game that has crashed. And that's rust. And it was once, this game has crashed more than 10 times whilst in a game (my player) and it's pissing me the fuck off. If you're an NBA fan you already have it, but if you have an interest in this game don't get it."

9943,Still the best basketball related game out there.
9944,im fat
9945,HEHE
9946,"this game have a lot of lags,bugs and bad servers but this game is the graetest basketball game"
9947,"Despite the bad reviews, thought I'd give it a chance since I used to love NBA 2K. Generally, I've purchased sport games on console, but wanted to try it on PC and it was on sale for $20, so I gave it a shot ...

For the most part, I was enjoying the fast load times and performance (compared to console) and then I started my MyCareer and got to the regular season after getting drafted. Now, I can't sim a game until I'm subbed in. When I try to the announcers go silent but the game doesn't skip ahead, meaning I can sit and watch a crappy 2K game for 30 minutes hoping I get subbed in. Good times. 

There are supposed fixes online, but pretty much all ""fixes"" involve removing any advantage having the game on PC may offer, such as locking the fps at 60 and turning on v-sync with a windowed display ...

So, despite good gameplay and generally very good performance, I can't suggest anyone buy a game with one of it's best features essentially unplayable on PC unless you basically want to play the console version on a screen that's likely smaller than your tv. 

NBA 2K isn't a mistake I'll make again."
9948,My Career is unplayable. Playing this game mode requires an in-game update which doesn't download. Been trying to download for an hour now and still at 0% after closing out and reopening 2k20 and verifying integrity of game files as well.
9949,great?
9950,"game pretty good but not realistic. In real life there is no NBA b/c of COVID-19 so yea stay safe. 5 ways to stay safe are

This game is total crap, grind for life or pay. Avoid if you can, but if you are a basketball fan like me we have no other choice. Praying for some other developer to kick 2k's butt.

9963,its amazing i love it
9964,"Every year 2K makes something extremely stupid and broken, along with other dumb stuff that happens. This year its scoring and defensive rotations in the paint. You can literally run past people and dunk the ball on the HARDEST difficulty. I don't know how the AI technology can regress like this. Not even gonna mention the micro-transactions, bothersome and tideous neighborhood system in career mode. Some people like it, but personally I don't enjoy the neighborhood. I would definitely not recommend getting this game without discounts. It's extremely overpriced for how much micro-transactions are included. After all if you like basketball, and want to play with recent teams you have no choice but to get the same as last year game with more technical issues, since there is no much option for another basketball game."
9965,this game good but a bit hard
9966,good game as well

9974,Its very addictive!
9975,"Got the Legend Edition on Amazon for $30. Haven't played 2K since 2K11, but the VC included was very useful for MyCareer. Very minimal grinding compared to my 2K11 days. The product placement has gotten ridiculous though...I can't stop thinking about Gatorade every time I go grocery shopping now. :/"
9976,Spent money on VC in this game turned out to lose all my accounts and other progress with no was of getting it back pls don't make the same mistake I did and waste your money on a game that can't even save a local file
9977,"I'm a huge basketball fan but this game runs like utter shit. GTX 1060 6 GB, 7th gen intel cpu and 16 GB of RAM but it runs at 20 frames per second on medium settings. Not to mention the graphics look absolutely hideous at that setting. The long story short is, if you're willing to play NBA 2k, do yourself a favour and play it on a console. The PC version is just a halfassed port and it shows it. Very clunky, and besides other people say that there are allegedly plenty of cheaters online. Do not buy. 


Rating: 2/10
The reason the score isn't any lower is solely based on my respect for the sport of basketball. Cheers x"
9978,"Online park play is an absolute abomination.  Last time I played was 2k18, and it was pretty fun.  The game lags horribly, only in park, and what few people are playing are absolute shits.  Instead of trying to play any games, they go around using exploits to make people leave the queue.  Forget the microtransactions, this game is only worth buying on PC for the singleplayer experience. 0/10 Wouldn't get paid to have this installed on my PC.  Do yourself a favor and stick to console."

9984,"--Edit 45 hours later--
This game is still bad. A lot of bad glitches that should have been patched. From my understanding, some of them continue to be rereleased in the newest game. This just shows that 2k has not yet learned it's lesson. Honestly, I enjoy playing this game sometimes still, but there's an obvious problem if I'd rather play a game that's out of date than to buy the newer version. There's nothing marketable about their reskins of the same content. Honestly, just buy 2k19, it's the same game as 20 and 21 just without the myPlayer builder, and that's honestly not that much of a loss when you consider the money you can save if you look for a cheap price on something like G2A. 

The new myCareer builder seemed promising, but disappoints. If you don't have internet, by the way, don't bother, cause you can't even play offline anymore. Another bad re-skin of the same only content, released buggy and gross to meet stupid deadlines that no one really cares about except the corporate bums that lose money on them. I'll try 2k again in a few years, maybe some needed changes will happen then."

9991,"IDC about bugs and sh*t, also park is filled with tryhards, but the MyCAREER even tho its difficult its fun"
9992,2k glitched my MyCareer so I am no longer able to earn salary I have tried everything on their website and sent a ticket. If they get back to me I'll change my review but right now this game has me heated.
9993,gud game

10000,"Before I begin yall need to hear me out for a min. The last NBA game I played was NBA 2k10 and I don't buy sports game every year because they're almost the same just with the new rosters, jersey, modes and lil improvement on gameplay. 

Now lets get into the review. I was little hesitant to buy NBA 2k20 from reading the mixed review, basically you'll find lotta negative reviews. About the Game Crash PRBLM idk what PC they have but for me it work perfectly fine and I've been playing for 5hours straight never encountered a single crash or any errors. 

The game been improved a lot ever since I last played NBA games on Xbox 360. I'm loving it, MyCareer mode is really fun for me maybe because I'm experiencing it for the first time and even FIFA nor PES came close with the Career Mode like 2k did. I gotta give a thumbs up for this game."
10001,Nice one
10002,awesome game
10003,This is such a super great game of all time
10004,"As a MyCareer player who plays online only when i'm with friends, I can say this game is pretty good. It's one of the most accurate basketball simulators and playing with friends online feels like playing with them in real life."
10005,trash game
10006,OK
10007,very exciting!
10008,"Another year full of cheaters and hackers, best of luck competing against them."

10010,great game and fun to play
10011,yessir
10012,nice game
10013,"don't buy this game. it's buggy and it doesn't offer anything the previous versions do not except for bugs and more cumbersome gameplay.

i bought this last week and it's now onsale, any price protection?"
10014,trash heap of a game. can't move in online games at all and can't do anything about it. fix your garbage games you trash company
10015,u can be a real nigga
10016,This game would be great... if it didn't crash every 10 minutes... :(
10017,"Been considering buying a 2k game for the PC as long as I can remember, but was hesitant and held back from getting it due to the atrocious reviews that it had been receiving on a yearly basis. Pulled the trigger during a steam sale, and boy am I regretting not grabbing it earlier. Gameplay is so good that it makes 2k unquestionably the best sports sim available currently in my opinion. The depth of offline is so extensive that i could go on endlessly, and MyTEAM isn't as P2W as the negative reviews would make it seem. I acquired a couple of decent players through grinding and I'm able to compete game in and game out with my opponents from simply being better at the game than them. Performance is solid on my GTX1060 laptop however i have noticed slight stuttering at times for brief moments, but nothing that ruins the experience. If you are on the fence about this game I would just advise waiting for it to go on sale as it frequently gets a massive price slash. Negative reviews from people with 50+ hours seems to stem more from salt than anything else. Can 2k make the game less grindy/P2W? Well obviously but the game is still good and therefore I'm going to recommend it."
10018,good game
10019,its aight
10020,"These games are getting progressively worse as the years go on. I try and give them a chance every few years, and it is just worse. The gameplay has suffered since the earlier games. There is far too much animation that goes into each movement making the simulation so slow. It seems like if you know all of the glitches in the game system, you can be a great player. the biggest killer to me though is the unnecessary animations. Players make completely unnecessary movements 90% of the time. The best thing about this game is the WNBA feature."
10021,very good
10022,Theres no heal from coronavirus card but sick game anyways i like i like.
10023,"just a bit bad really, broken animations, broken servers, open alley oop passes have like an 80% turnover chance. itd all be worth it if you could at least create a player that was a skill level of other nba superstars. but after either 100s of hours of grinding or around 100 hours with spending money your ""99"" overall player will actually be the equivalent to an 85 player compared to the rest of the league. youll be limited to only a couple of things that you can be good at meaning that you could never make a fully all-round player like lebron. The other modes are just as broken too, not just the mycareer. Myteam is pretty much pay to win with the best cards only available through high vc-costing packs. MyGM has the same morale problems that it always has. playing as the rockets and having eric gordon constantly hassle you to be a starter even though hes been the rockets 6 man for the past couple of years gets a little annoying. they havent really changed much from 2k19, the neighbourhood is more or less the same, just without the footlocker branding on the shoe store. the menu screens look a little different but it still feels as broken as the game i played last year. but hey, at least zion is in this one... right guys?"

10029,LOVE THISSSSSSSS
10030,"This game features un-skippable ads, even after paying full price. There are also un-skippable cut scenes in game that make things take much longer than they should. There are graphics glitches, and the game is much more demanding on the computer than advertised. When creating a custom team, the sleeves are all always blue, regardless of custom team colors. This is a glitch in the 2k series for some time now, still not fixed, been around since 2k16 at least (2k16 is the last basketball game I bought before 2k20 - I don't buy the new version every year.). I had this game refunded on steam, currently only play single-player mode on xbox one. Multiplayer is unplayable due to bugs and cheaters that are never dealt with. Emails to 2k support are ignored. Can't recommend this- seems more like an NBA branded cash grab than a game."
10031,bit litty still
10032,kyle kuzma is nowhere to be found wahahah
10033,"MyCareer bugged, hof quick draw but shoots very slow"
10034,Bought this on special. Doesn't matter what I paid as the game crashes consistently. Don't buy. It's so frustrating.
10035,"I really only play the game mode My League and I really enjoy that. Just playing that mode makes it a really good basketball game. I can see how My Career at times can be just a cash grab, is one reason I don't really pay much attention to that game mode."
10036,I have yet to play a full game before the whole thing crashes.
10037,"For my Carreer, i cant get any VC coin even though i win my my game, please fix it."

10041,"Totally garbage for mg player!
1.you can't do even anything but you are their boss.If you don't follow me,you are fired,so you should do what i want, it simple logic.
2.you cant make your own  new draft for the first year.Do you know what interest mg player like? Create a player and help him be the star!But we hate the player randomly created by computer.
3.I must get my player at the start of the MG and he must be choosen by me,by my team,or  i feel disgusted!But i have to get him after two seasons !fuck your whole family!
4.Now you can only pass a day or a week ,so slow!!!!!!!but you must get your own player after two seasons!fuck your ass hole!
5.let me change the draft anytime!!Let me start offseason! so i can pick my player !
6.I really hope I can force the makers to play mg mode for 1000h ,its the most horrible thing i can imagine.
7.I cant play a player in MG,I have to play the whole team!BUT,I just want to play one! You cancel  a very veryyyyyy import set in MG!and the time set and the difficulty set!
8.Just let 20'and 21's MG like 19
9.I play MG not ML,just because i want some data useful.


...............
OK,MC mode is just ok,the game is not all garbage,but MG MODE IS!


other question:(BUGs!!!!!!!!!)
1.history draft , the stars never get the ROY.because their age of nba is not 0,it also make them retire earlier.
2.thanks god ,you fixed the bug in 2019 when comes to second year,all player will like to shoot  
 under the basket(I am not a native speaker ,but you can get me).
but why not fixed other bugs?like skating.
3.when i create new player(NOT in MC,but when you make a new draft or a new player's DNA),I find the height and the length of the arm are ok, but i CAN'T change the length of the leg!!!!!YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN!the third one of the body!!
4.MC sometimes, you can't jump to the time when you can join the game,you must press alt+enter and then you can press passing-key to jump to the right time!

5.I do believe this garbage have more bugs, when i find them ,i will upload.After all ,Even today nba2k2019 still have the bug that all the basketball players will like to shoot under basket(Tendency will become 99).

6.I find one!IN MG and ML, Centers  somethings  just don't renew a contract!so they will retire within 3 years in MG and ML!FUCK that shit!

7.If you are a pc player who use keyboard and mouse to play the game,you can adjust the camera but can't make it always be ""2K"" or others.each time you enter the game,you have to adjust it again!(BUG)


-----------------------------------------------
You know what? 
they ban me.
ban a player who only play against computer~and never join the mc park and never play against the mt players and only play against computer~
wow~
yes,i admit that  i cheat, like changing the gs to beat the computer 
like playing a super game to get more than hundreds points
but , is it really OK to ban such a player who nearly only play the game offline?
In fact,I don't care,garbage game.
I buy it for i have no choice.But now i think, in fact, nba is not a big deal for me .
So thank you 2k, i will pick my ball and play the real basketball game~
rather than wasting my life in the garbage game with so many bugs which you never fix up.
So my MT team ""VIRUS"" just remain in your game,and hope it will always be there.

plus:Banning me is not the reason that i give it a bad, the game itself is.So don't mix up,if the game is good ,even i was banned i will still give good ,but it is far from good, it is even a garbage for me."

Do not buy. Not even on sale. This franchise is over and needs a competitor."

10055,great i reccomend playin my team to learn
10056,I like this game a lot but sometimes it has trouble running. I should also note that the game play is very fun but if you want to play online you might as well buy a different sports game because this is primarily microtransaction based. The offline is very fun and playing with friends is fun. The competitive online is terrible and needs to be completely re done
10057,TERRIBLE GAME!! OLDER NBA WERE WAY BETTER!!

10063,"Really fun game inspired by National Basketball Association (NBA), I recommended people buying this game cause it's worth every single penny that you guys spent! really fun to play, comes to many games modes Park, NBA Game, Quick Play, Black Top & My Career."

Your character starts doing mysterious sh!t like dropping the ball out of no where with no defenders, the other team hitting nothing but green shots, on top of that, its basically the same game from 2K19. This sh!t belongs in a garbage can. But then again, my garbage can has done more for me than this pathetic game."
10074,"Fun for the single player experience, less fun for the multiplayer given the fact that people somehow were able to ""hack"" the wingspan in some online modes."

10076,"The game crashes randomly, you get random errors and it kicks you out of the game. The game is also FULL of cheaters, there's no anticheat for this trash game, all your game experience is ruined. It has lag and desync, and it's also a toxic community, players wont play with you if you don't have a high reputation rank (and you can't climb up if you don't play park). Don't recommend the game to buy, I regret wasting every dollar on this broken game."

It's seemingly impossible to get any scoring in MyCareer mode (which I mostly play the 2K games for) to start, your character is horribly slow, inaccurate, and unable to break free from any kind of defense. On top of that, teammates missing easy Assists right under the basket or open shots, this is definitely not any fun like 2k18 or 2k19 Career modes were."

If you find the game is hard with keybinds just download a ps3 controller driver and use a controller instead.

The game is an unbalanced, poorly optimized shitfest.
Never touching a 2k game not even with a 10 feet pole ever again.

The amount of sitting around waiting for random s**t like hidden loading screens and pre-game commentary during 'mycareer' is astounding. Speaking of 'mycareer', it's not compatible with 144hz monitors. This game has been out for several months and yet they can't fix a bug that won't let you simulate to your next shift.

First off, DO NOT be like me and spend real money on VC to buy packs. 
Second, DO NOT spend your MT to open packs. There are packs that costs upwards to 17k MT, the odds are so bad, that all you do is end up doing  is quick selling everything for less than 2k in return. 

I only play myTeam. My multiplayer experience has been horrible. You can expect to wait more than 30 mins just to get matched up with an opponent who has a lineup with the best cards in the game. It's hard enough get to win, let alone go 12 - 0. Then after you rage quit, you return to the lobby just to matched up against the same OP opponent again. SMH."

One  recognizable improvement could be badge system, but it is so broken that a lot of 60 ovr player have max badges at Park. 2k team never fix the delay in online myPark and have a poor matchup system in Rec center. Highly recommend not to buy 2k20 on PC since cheaters and hackers were everywhere in the server. I would say the badge system is a waste of time as 2k keep patching OP builds (stretch, BP builds)"

10190,"Okay, look, I've been playing 2K religiously for actual years. On Playstation, Xbox, and of course now on PC. Honestly, the physics look realistic, the dribbling is crafty, and shots are hard to get, making you play basketball instead of 2K. Not so bad. H0WEVER;;; THE PASSING, PAINT, AND JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GAMEPLAY IS EXTREMELY AND TOTALLY STUPID. HONESTLY, EVEN PLAYERS WITH HALL OF FAME DIMER, 99 PASSING ARE COMPLETE AND TOTAL GARBAGE WHEN IT COMES TO HAVING A HINT OF AWARENESS AS TO WHERE THE F******* DEFENDERS ARE. ITS HONESTLY RIDICULOUS. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME."
10191,good
10192,"Have been trying to play online for two weeks, never can get it to work. Always just waiting in the lobby."
10193,"I've had the game for a day and its crashed 3 times, not optimized for pc very well"
10194,It is generally the same game but if you want to use the new rookies and wear the new jerseys by all means buy this game.
10195,The grind is Fun but not to Extreme. hella fun when you max/learn your build.
10196,The GOAT gamer ever
10197,"This game is mediocre at best. The AI is arbitrary. The exact same situation can unfold in the exact same way two different times, only with two different outcomes. It's mostly nonsense. Whatever modifiers or sliders the game uses, they're random."
10198,"just get it on console, or better yet, stop buying these games it's like a yearly subscription to the same shit over and over again, you can just use updated rosters when you play against friends locally or whatever, I've spent too much on vc in this games on console, games pretty dead too in park"
10199,very gud
10200,"its not the best game tbh, but it keeps me playing so i quess its not that bad"
10201,fucking game keeps on crushing even in close fucking games bruh fix the fucking game I spent alot for this shit
10202,"I bought it on sale, just for the WNBA game mode. It's okay. Fun! Just incomplete. Wish I could do some other modes as some of my favorite players, like Delle Donne, but it's fun. Hopefully later entries in the series will get better."
10203,GOOD
10204,Game Sampah
10205,Numerous times I've started a myleague and ill spend hours playing then ill save it but the game doesn't save it and i can't load it so i've wasted my time. Also the game won't allow me to download custom team designs. Literally the 2 things i bought this game for and it won't allow. DO NOT waste your time
10206,Remote play pretty good
10207,although no improvement in playing mechanics and the animation sometimes is clunky it still manages to make me happy and if you're one of those people that always buys the game yearly then yeah you should
10208,"I love 2k, I've been playing consistently since 2K6 on the Xbox 360 (Best career mode by far btw) 
I've got a lot of tolerance for the scummy 2K practices that have slowly seeped into this franchise simply because I'm a die hard basketball fan and this is the only sim that is as close as you can get (come on NBA live, dethrone this monster)
I was able to swim through all the BS in the recent years: VC for haircuts, cheesy as all hell MyCareer stories that pander as hard as they can to please every demographic, Ronnie2k's smug stupid face, the low effort to actually upgrade the base game from year to year in terms of graphics and playability, but now I cant even play this game. It crashes constantly and the closest solution that I could find is to rollback my graphics card driver to the last ""playable"" version. 

TLDR; The game crashes often so if you weren't already put off by the sleezy business practices of NBA2k, now you can't even play it on PC. Fantastic.
"
10209,This game keeps crashing! Its not like because when you play a game and there is quick save. In this you play almost a whole hour and last second it crashes. This game has so many bugs. You cant even sub in on My Career. I bought this game for $20 but it should be $5

10212,ITS OK I GUESS
10213,"GOOD GAME
"
10214,"Literally the worst 2k game out of the series. Should have just re-issued 2k19 with few upgrades. 

Pros- Dunk animations, badge customization, WNBA

Cons- Auto dribble animations, Insane Lag, Park crashing, no award for blocks, constant defend assignments, dumb team AI, locked shooting in the paint, and many more.

It's sad bc it is the only basketball game town so they can get away with never fixing their crap servers and gameplay. COD:MW supports cross-platform and their servers for the most part run like a well-oiled machine!"
10215,"it is fun
"
10216,"Gameplay is beyond trash, tries to do many things but none of them does good. PC port is way behind in performance, online has constant issues and game is littered with predatory lootboxes. Every year they just print the new game with 0 improvements and piling issues.

Oh and unskippable ads in a pricey game. Fuck off."

10238,"don't buy this fking game. I just bought this game and I found out I couldn't play MC cuz I am unable to connect to the server in China, error code 2fd7b735. I bought this game for MC, and now you tell me i can't do shit about it. aren't you supposed to warn your customers about that bullshit before they purchase this game? and give me one fking reason why do we have to be connected to the server for just playing a solo MC mode? 
别买这个破游戏。我今天买了这游戏才发现，他妈的在中国没法连接他的服务器，一打开就是错误代码 2fd7b735，所以职业生涯模式无法玩。你们不应该提前告诉消费者这种事情吗？你他妈给我一个理由，为什么我想玩单机的生涯模式还他妈必须要连接你的服务器？我草你妈的烂游戏烂公司。"
10239,"If you're a fan of basketball, that's the game just for you! It has lots of different skills and strategies!"
10240,"
This is a horrible game the animation and bad, they are to slow, they glitch out and do something completely difficult then what they supposed to do. It is not worth buying this game. Unless it is free then sure why not but I won’t spend a penny on this game. I wish I could get my money back
"
10241,"Gameplay is solid, but this game crashes so often it gets incredibly frustrating to play. I just play myleague, so I can't comment on the microtransactions, but I'm sure they are as bad as everyone says. This is the best it gets as far as basketball games on pc go though. It's very unfortunate. If you're a diehard nba fan, and you gotta have the newest nba game, then you don't really have a choice. However, if you are on the fence and know you wont it that much, I really would recommend just not buying it because the crashes will not be worth it."
10242,"The same errors every 2K, almost the same game, a lot of defensive mistakes, the movement of the NPCS is very bad. When playing Hall of fame level, the game gets more mistakes. I love playing my career, but I wish the game was better. How is that it can't be created a player with more than 85 3pt and more than 85 Dunk. I had bought 2K since 2K7 and some things were better before. Some plays are too false. When attempting a dunk it changes to a bad layup motion because of a defender that is like 4 ft behind. I hate that the motions are forced."

10259,"I don't often take time to review games on Steam, but this needs to be said. This game is a huge piece of garbage. I fully expected coming in that this would basically be a re-release of an old game with new rosters. That's just what these sports games are, yet people pluck them up for $60 every year.  I picked this up on sale for $20, so I was pretty tolerant of issues coming in. In short, this game is a [b]nearly unplayable buggy Gatorade/Beats/Express commercial[/b]. Hell, for all the in your face product placement (way more than you think) this may as well be free to play. This review sponsored by Gatorade GX, change the way you refuel. Beats.

Bugs:
Here are just a few of the bugs you can expect to see:
[list]
  [*]Seemingly random crashes to desktop at any given moment. Especially fun after you've played 30+ minutes of your MyCareer game and you lose all your progress.
  [*] If you set your refresh rate to anything higher than the 60hz default, then when you simulate to your next appearance in a MyCareer game, the game slows down to a crawl. It will not begin simulating until after about 1 minute of this and/or after you alt+tab a few times to ""kick start"" it.
  [*] Online neighborhood games are often a lagfest, and there is a constant underlying latency added to your shot timing. Essentially you need to completely re-adjust how you shoot when playing online. This isn't game breaking, but it sure as hell is annoying.
[/list]

Other comments:

In fairness to this game, when the MyCareer isn't crashing, it's actually quite fun. You can tell they expect you to grind to become a half decent player, and that feels a little more heavy handed than older versions I've played. This is likely a ploy to get you to spend your hard earned money on more VC so that you can actually compete, but to be honest it didn't take that much work for me to get to an 80 overall, and with smart play you can still be a competent player. Also, all of my experience has been in MyCareer mode. I've heard MyLeague/MyTeam are fun, and I can't personally attest to how stable those modes are. But know that if MyCareer is what you are after, you are probably going to be frustrated.

Honestly, for a game that does so little to innovate every year, you would think they would at least fix the bugs. However, they still sell every year without fixing anything so I won't hold my breath. I should note that when googling the random crash to desktop issue, I've found forum posts from NBA2K18 complaining about the same issue. Awesome.

Final Verdict:
Don't buy this POS on Steam. The PC version isn't stable enough for an early access alpha let alone a ""AAA"" release. If you must play this game, I highly recommend you get it on console. I assume it actually functions there."
10260,Quite easy to get the hang of for a new player and fun overall.
10261,I am A HUGE BASKETBALL FAN and i think this game is the best basketball game ever!!!!!

Can anyone help me as to why this happened? in need of help"

10273,"proper basketball game for 2019-2020. Playing mycareer requires VC/Real world money.
Online modes other than ""play now"" and ""blacktop"" are pay to win!

there are still bugs in MyLeague that cause game to crash

myleague is pretty fun this year"
10274,"Constant Crashing, Myleague hasn't been updated... glitches where you have to match offers for RFA even if you offer them the max... fun game if it can actually stay on long enough to play"
10275,"It's a pretty fun game. As expected from a mainly console based sports game, there are lots of online issues and crashes at random moments though. Playing against friends doesn't run as smoothly as it does on Playstation (visually) but that might be on my part, since i haven't heard my friend that i play against complain about it."

10284,"for me this game is a fun, a break to play myplayer, when I only have enough time to play one game.  Yes there is VC you can buy, yes there is advertising you can't miss.  I guess the DEVS decided to make it like a tv broadcast, might as well paid their pockets with advertising dollars as well, virtual commercials you could say.  2k isn't the first, or will be the last.  In this day of freemium games and games in which you need DLC to ""Complete"" a story, we all have two choices, either shut up and play the game, or just don't play!"
10285,"The game crashes unreasonably every time I start. Frequently disconnected while playing, but instead fixing their trash server, 2k made a very FRIENDLY penalty by dropping your overall 0.5 every time you got booted. Besides all of these shits, you could never find a normal game in the park. Hackers are everywhere and you have to get used to it. You'll never going to find any enjoyment in this game so please don't waste your money."
10286,"This game randomly stops playing and goes back to the Steam app. Not sure if this is because of Steam or if it's because of 2K, but it is super annoying. I've done the integrity check and everything, just short of an uninstall and reinstall."
10287,This is literally the most dog shit game I have ever wasted my time or money on. I hate 2k so much. I hate Ronny JewGay and I hate this franchise. Its the kind of the game you get addicted to and then wish you never even bothered playing it in the first place. Fuccck 2k.

10308,"I really have no clue what other people are saying about this game being terrible, its perfect besides the amount of players and one glitch. Its really fun and the same exact thing as the console versions. The glitch is in MyCareer where you cant sim to your play and then sometimes the game goes into slow-mo. But also The MyTeam is perfect and really fun."
10309,"with the amount of money this company makes yearly, you would think they would hire someone to fix all the bugs. my PC is well above the minimum requirements to run this game and i still cant get through a game without it crashing."

Mycareer is also a pay to win and takes entirely way too much time to grind the badges unless you master the obsurd mechanics that are ""next level"". However, the only thing about this game that is alright is you get roster updates. Don't waste your money or time, you won't be rewarded. The only way you get rewarded is if you live in the middle east."

10323,"L'ultimo gioco di basket che comprerò, ma non per buoni motivi.. Sto giocando solo la modalità My Gm (il sistema simil RPG di avere punti per migliorare può essere buona, ma cominciare la stagione senza poter fare i cambi è oltre lo stupido) e le partite mi fanno uscire di testa più di un FPS con il ping alle stelle: un taglio dell'avversario lo fermi solo se ti metti in mezzo preventivamente, perchè il tuo difensore è legnoso e non riesci mai a muoverlo rapidamente ne' in maniera pulita. Se vuoi cambiare giocatore devi sempre sceglierlo tu direttamente, perchè se l'attaccante salta il diretto avversario e tu volessi prendere il lungo per andare in aiuto, sta pur certo che la IA non te lo sceglierà mai. I penetra e scarica? Potresti o non potresti riuscire a passarla al giocatore che vuoi. Non ho idea di come possa essere la modalità My Player ma a questo punto non so se avrò la pazienza di dargli una possibilità"

10328,"Riddled with bugs and pay-to-win contents. I only played offline modes for the most part, still I had to wait till it is on sales to buy it. 100% not worth buying with full price and I would never recommend anyone to this. 

Sad because I played the very first NBA 2k with Iverson on the cover and at the time, the narrative was that 2k games is the small company compare to EA million-dollar investment. Now they are horrible both the same.

Many functions not working and 2K never bothered to fix any of it. MyLeague, MyCareer (besides the stupid career movie that the dev thinks we want, which is horribly made and wasted so much money hiring the likes of Idris Elba to do a piss poor job in voice acting), Franchise modes all remain the same for at least 4, 5 installments. 

It's a shame that it originally cost $60.

(Update: 10/1/2020, after being plagued by ERROR CODE 726e613d, I am so done with this game. Apparently they never fix this and let it happen again in 2K21. This company is a shit show.)"

10350,"If you are a MyLeague player, I would recommend just sticking with a previous year. All the same bugs that have been in the game for 4 or 5 years now are still there:
- GLeague progression totally ludicrous causing every random scrub in the league to become an instant stud just because they played in the GLeague, which in turns causes the overall talent level to skyrocket, causing actually talented prospects to become extremely undervalued.
- Contract length and the ability to resign players is extremely wonky. Players on current rookie contracts have their lengths and ability to resign screwed up, causing you to lose out on players for nothing or not have a chance to extend them before they are a free agent.

MyLeague players - save your money. They also made MyGM mode a ""ranked"" type mode so they removed a ton of customization options, even if you want to play ""unranked"".

I am not a MyCareer or online player so I can't comment on those.

EDIT: Forgot about another huge one. If you have a NVIDIA graphics card, you have to roll back to drivers from 6 months ago to have the game not crash every 2 minutes. I don't know whether this is an NVIDIA issue or not but this is the only game I have had this problem with. My rig is excellent, it is definitely a specific issue to this game. Whether it is NVIDIA or 2K's fault the fact remains that you have to go out of your way to make this game work out of the box. This has been ongoing for 6 months as far as I can tell (only bought the game a couple weeks ago)."

10356,"The game has significantly regressed since 2k18, AI defense is non-existent and the game is riddled with milestone barriers which require extensive grinding or pay to win microtransactions. 

On top of that, 2k is a company going to way of EA in terms of business practice and ethics. The fact that this game has passed ESRB gambling bans despite being filled with roulette wheels, slot machines and card packs/loot boxes seems puzzling until you realise that the chair of the ESRB and the president of 2k is the same person.

Buy 2k18 and get a roster update, you'll have a better time."

A drama fueled story about characters that i couldn't care less and the u finally get to the nba and the shit, slow and not fun grind begins to get a mostly constipated player to be almost capable. For some reason multiplayer drops frame rates left and right, the gameplay is clunky and unresponsive. Just an overall bad game"
10372,Pay to win. Movement is so bad. MyPark is trash  with only 90 and up overall u can shoot in baskets without green but with 60 to 89 u only can shot baskets with green. The taller guy have problems with rebounding than  shorter guy. This game is lowkey trash and so expensive.

I've tried changing it to windowed, verified cache, re-installed, updated drivers and windows and nothing resolves the issue. Game has been our for almost 6 months and this is still an issue."

10406,"While it is probably the best online basketball game with great physics, the game is being ruined by microtransactions that begs you to spend your money in order to avoid the endless grind. Also, for anybody who has played previous NBA titles, you can expect the same shitty bugs online and poor server quality. Constant disconnects/ The courts constantly freezing and you have to restart the game. While performance everywhere is good, you have constant tearing on neighborhood, in pro-am Mode there is a bug that prevents you from some times queuing as 3 man and force you to play as 5. It is really sad that this otherwise really well made basketball game suffer from so many technical issues months after it is release and this happens to all NBA games that I have played since 2014."

Story mode was too quick and i was disappointed that the story doesn't remotely cross over once you are drafted by a team. I appreciate the underdog stories every sports game has now but id like to be able to be the top prospect for once, without injury or any other drama to overcome. It would be nice to play a few high school games and base your recruiting off of that."
10436,you cant make a shot! it is literally impossible to drain a bucket you have to be perfect to and wide open to make a shot. the game is broken look it up all the forums are saying the same thing. didnt think it was true i thought it was a gimmick but upon playing this trash i find it is indeed true and you have to be literally perfect to make a basket!

10469,"""I bought 2k20 because it was on sale for 20 dollars. When I bought the game I intended to play MyCareer but a couple of things about this game mode that is just wrong. First you can't play offline even if you just want to play solo. That means that you must always have an internet connection. This is probably a way to deter cheaters and VC hackers in the game, as the devs can just ban you and you won't be able to play the career mode at all; this maximizes their profits from the numerous amount of microtransactions in the game. Which leads me to another point, your starting player is very bad, you can have a 85 shot rating and consistently miss wide open shots more than you will make them; even with the shooter build. I'm sorry but I don't see any real NBA shooter that misses wide open shots consistently like this game makes you miss. Your player can't defend, he can't score, he's pretty much useless until you get of a higher rating. Which would be fine, but the game gives you starter's minutes as a 60 rating going against high rated NBA superstars that will leave you with the impression that your player is moving in slow motion, it's just so unfun from an individual standpoint, yeah your team may win, but you're not having fun playing your character. Also the CPU will defend aggressively and constantly rip the ball from you if you try to do any kind of ball handling. The grind for VC is crazy, everything about this game mode is a grind. I'm just holding out hope for NBA Live 2021 or something."""

""Downloading Game Updates"" while inside of client. Takes more time than the 83GB download.

Might be the scummiest thing I've seen in PC gaming.

Havent played it yet - but letting people know in case they were planning on possibly using the 2 hour refund window.

Quick Edit: After playing a bit -

1. Do not try to play this without a controller. The keyboard/mouse controls are horrible and bugged. Half are missing and will not save when you try to rebind them.

2. You cannot sim MyTeam games. (unless Im blind)

3. You cannot watch MyGM games. (unless Im blind)"

10482,Great Game
10483,"This game crashes so much it's really not fun, this is the first game I have requested a refund on because in my career I the game will usually either flat out crash resulting in me losing progress and restarting the same game multiple times or it will just slow down to a grind and then freeze and crash mid game, i have only played about 4 matches in my career once my character made it into the league just to be stuck against the clippers and I'm unable to progress any further, I have updated my graphics card, done the fixes mentioned in the other posts and it still keeps happening. its a fun game but the AI will usually try to run down the clock even if they are losing and I have had a few instances where the ai will simply walk off the court resulting in losing possession and it's really frustrating because this actually still feels like a good game underneath the glitches, crashing and dumb ai.
the prologue is alot shorter than 2K19, the park is the same but it appears the lost the footlocker sponsorship and online still has alot of hackers, if you are into multiplayer only for this game just get it on console. it looks alot better on pc but the issues are really glaring."
10484,"I bought Nba 2k20 with no intention of playing online , I just wanted to play against the CPU or Locally against a friend. So although the greedy pay to win online card system  infuriates me , it has little to do with this review. Basically the technical issues that plague this game is the reason for this negative review. I have a Ryzen 5 3600 cpu along with a Radeon rx 5700 xt and run the game at 1080 p . All drivers are updated to the latest versions . I average over 200 fps but the game still randomly crashes  and not just ctd , but shuts the whole desktop down crashes ( as in i have to hard restart ) .  Along with this I am constantly having to reset settings that i have reset and saved 3 trillion times, am constantly prompted to enter my Bday and email EVERY TIME I open the game ( 2K's constant greedy push to get me to participate in pay to win online activities)  and there is a  certain lack of options in game play  ( I think the 3 second rule is the dumbest rule in all of sports) . I would ask for a refund , but have already had the game for too long . I am honestly afraid that this game is so bugged that it could wreck my GPU"

10532,One foot lay ups at The RIM miss way to often for PRO players that deep!!! foul calls dont come for your team but touch one of theirs and automatic foul call with free throws even when its a clear block. When you have the  other player beat with speed they can ALWAYS get back in front of you anyway and box you out or keep you from getting a lay up or jam. This game is buggy as hell and needs to be more PLAYER Friendly its about the PLAYER anyway isnt it? We pay to much to get SCREWED at the rim.

10546,"descent game
"
10547,"While I said that 2K19 probably would be my last, in the end I could not resist the urge to ""upgrade"". But as you will find out from my review, this is definitely a decision I regret wholeheartedly.

I play almost exclusively MyLeague, I am not affected too much by horrible MTX and Lootboxes and Roulettes and whatever crap 2K built into this game to suck money out of the customer's pockets. However, for a number of technical reasons and design choices even the relatively autonomous MyLeague mode is completely boring and unusuable for me:

1. The gameplay is too easy. I know, I know, there are multiple difficulty modes and sliders and whatnot. But I traditionally like to play on ""Allstar"", the sweet spot where the CPU does not cheat (too much) and it could still feel like a challenge if I do not take care of the ball. However, compared to 2K18 and especially 2K19, Allstar is super easy in 2K20. I have no problem whatsoever scoring and locking down the CPU, which should not be that easy. Not to mention the fact that the game does not look like simulated basketball. Almost every game is a blowout and I play the 4th quarter with the bench mob. Imagine the fun I have... And yes, again, I know, there are other difficulties. But the thing is, I tried Superstar and even HOF once: same result, blowouts and unrealistic gameplay, but now by the CPU as well. In conclusion: Gameplay is a big step down for me this year. So much in fact that I have uninstalled the game multiple times out of boredom.

2. The game crashes frequently. I know that there was a recent nVidia driver that made the game unstable, but I use the workaround (disable a graphics option), so that is fine. No, the crashes I mean are during setting up one of my most fun projects the past years, building all 30 teams from scratch in a MyLeague draft. Tried it at least three times in the last few months: Every time it crashed at some point during the draft, while browsing through the player list or selecting a player. No idea why, the game is intransparent in its crash reports. So no fun projects for me then...

3. Window repositioning sucks. This may be a strange thing, but I have a 21:9 monitor and for a few years have played NBA2K in a window on one side of the monitor, with a video playing on the other side. It helps me relax and switch off my brain after work. However, this year, for some unknown reason to me, some 2K developer or designer decided that the game window will recenter itself multiple times: 3x before the game starts and 2x before and after the half-time show. This is beyond annoying, as I have to drag the window back to its previous position. And it makes no sense whatsoever for the game to do that. Let me decide where I want my windows in Windows, do not decide it for me. The first time I noticed that I thought it was a bug on my side. But no, the game is the only one that does this. All previous NBA2K games were fine with their window position throughout the runtime. Seriously, who designed this idiocy?

I will not talk about the MTX or many of the other things that are bad (or even good) about the game, because these three things are the major factors for me deciding to give this game a strong thumbs down overall. I just uninstalled it again, maybe for good this time. I should install 2K19 or 2K18 again and continue my custom Heat or Lakers franchises, respectively, where I could have a small challenge and uninterrupted fun, because the technical side works fine. Or maybe I am just done altogether with NBA2K and work on reducing my backlog of shame."

Pros: 
- Refined a lot of the systems to make them a bit more forgiving and seamless. ex. I can actually bench press now, still can't irl, but baby steps)
- Player upgrading feels like less of a chore, more fun.

Cons: 
- The Neighbourhood is a carbon copy of the 2K19 one (if not earlier, 2K19 was the first I played)
- The training staff in the team gym have the same dialogue as in 2K19, they just stripped out your player nickname from 19 (""Come on *weird void space* get it together"", instead of ""Come on AI, get it together"")"

10561,"A game littered with bugs and practically unfinished, I don't recommend it (as of right now). I can really see why people hate the PC version. The only thing I love about this game is that they changed the badge level system with cut down grinding a lot. Went on to park, encountered a bug where the fps would drop to 30 and stay for a few seconds and come back to 60. This is proven to be really annoying since it's probably an optimisation issue that 2K is just simply too lazy to fix. I understand that they have to work on console aswell but can't we atleast get an optimised game? 

Would recommend if they fixed bugs (144hz sim to appearance bug, mild fps drops, crashes etc)"
10562,Going from 2k19 career to 2k20 career I can tell you this fucking sucks. Even with the 100k that comes with the top edition of the game it is impossible to shoot. Absolutely ruins the fun of it.

10580,"MyCareer mode often in slow motion when 144HZ, This bug has existed for a long time, but they don't want to fix it. 😑"
10581,i like the dunks and stuff but ball handleng and players moving feel to slow
10582,this game is so trash no more needs to be said
10583,crashes a lot
10584,this maybe a game for you... maybe not
10585,They managed to make a game shitty and good at the same time. It's okay :/
10586,"my careeer progression its terrible i join being a 6'3 point guard and i cant see to hold on to the ball i dropped it every time i move to do anything the main thing im suppose to be just a little bit good at,the devs make sure your character is literally handicapped so u have to spend money on vc which is way you are absolute trash at everything and they always have the neighborhood options hitting you on the face every where u go so u bite into spending monet to get a decent player to play coz trust me online in the neighborhood u are a walking Lu will drop the ball always miss every shot and your character reaction time is slow to a halt again just so you feel so bad at the game that u spend money.next 2k game will make u start with no arms and legs and u gotta buy them with vc unless u get the legends edition that comes standard with a pair of hands and legs to dribble the ball.this is a big rant and yeah i havent played enough but its because i know how this game is i boycotted nba 2k for almost 5 years and its they atill are a piece of shit company that makes game progression be all about paying trust me progresssing without paying its almost impossible like i said im a pg that drops the ball like i was 6month old baby.fuck u 2k plz go bankrupt u are scum asf"
10587,"NEVER EVER BUY 2K GAMES!

cant play mycareer because it wont download updates, just gets stuck on 0 percent, an issue that is normal for EVERY 2K game and they still havent bothered to fix it. I have had to reinstall the game a dozen times, tried several recommended fixes nothing has worked.  So spent money on a game that doesnt work. 

2K doesnt care theyll just sell the next years game to fools. It wont be this fool. A game they barely change year to year and they still dont fix the glitches and problems that make it so a decent amount of players CANT EVEN PLAY THE DAMN GAME!

And cant get shit help from 2K they dont give a crap. Community advice is the only thing to try and unlucky for me their several fixes have not worked for me. A game that they sell for an arm and a leg should not need the community coming up with all the way to MAKE THE GAME PLAYABLE!

DONT BUY 2K EVER!"
10588,"great game , ez wins im goated"
10589,"Major step in the wrong direction for this franchise. Completely ruined MYGM with Action Point (AP) system and NO story component. Online play is rampant with hackers. Petty progression system that forces microtransactions, unless you want an unforgiving grind. What a complete piece of trash.

R.I.P. Kobe"
10590,This will be the last 2K game I buy. Honestly they remove more and more features every year and replace them with absolute garbage features. I play for offline my myleage and they have COMPLETELY gutted it. Honestly unless you are buying this game for a $10 sale. Stay far away from this publisher as 2k is complete trash now.
10591,Zjbs game
10592,constantly crashes so annoying
10593,no
10594,ok
10595,The best game i ever play
10596,"nba 2k20  it's suck , I'm not playing on consoles I'm  playing on pc the game not optimized at all , i low setting still same shts lag is f, not played smooth"
10597,Great game
10598,"Man this game is so frustrating... When you play MyCareer, the only game mode everyone wants to play just to create your own player and go to the NBA or the park, etc. If you go to any team and you play the Golden State Warriors Curry and Klay will hit so many 3s that you will get angry, but when you decide to go to GSW suddenly everyone in the team becomes retarded, Steph can't hit 2 open 3s in a row, Klay can't do it either. Whatever team you go instantly everyone on it becomes a retarded player, taking stupid shots and missing wide open mid-range or 3-pointers.

The thing about archetypes is also frustrating, you can't create a player like LeBron or MJ because if you can shoot and defend then you can't finish at the rim, if you finish and shoot you can't play defense. If you create a 7.0 post scoring center with a good defense and good post game then you can't shoot a simple mid range shot or freethrow.

The most anoying thing about this is the lack of reallity in it, you post up with a 7'1 against a 6'10 with no defense whatsoever and you can't score on him, but the other way around he can posterize you every single time even with good defensive stats.

2K needs to realize that people want to play good basketball and play with good teammates instead of playing with retarded players everywhere you go. They need to create a Story where your decisions count, because here whatever you decide in the story it will always end up in the same shit... I remember when you could choose between Universities and play for the one you choose, were you can take this endorsment or that one instead of everytime the same over and over again."
10599,"well, at least this game still be a basketball game which can't be replace"
10600,only if it was on sale
10601,lots of bugs but it s nice
10602,Love dis game!
10603,"lll
"
10604,"This season they changed the way of unlocking items by increasing myRep instead of your character overall rating, if you dont play park or pro am, you cant increase your myRep and this sucks cause you cant unlock most of the items. But overall, its NBA, so its fun."
10605,"The only thing good about this game is the Mycareer story. Other than that this game is a total scam and money vacuum. MyCareer system is the biggest BS yet. You pay $80 for a game, and on top of that you have to basically pay money to purchase VC to be a decent player in MyCareer? Whatever happened to grinding skill points and getting better? How can you expect a 65-70 overall to compete with NBA level talent? That's just criminal of 2k. Huge skill gap. If you want a decent 2k myplayer experience you basically have to buy it or grind through endless levels of frustration to even get to a decent level. I do not recommend purchasing these games, they're just reskins of last year with more useless content to purchase with virtual currency."
10606,despite all the other bad reviews 2k20 is a good game. But console would be a better experience no cap
10607,welllllll   if you go more than two weeks without playing umm 2K decides they dont want you to be able to play hahah     great fun.   Madden it is then.
10608,"its honestly not bad
"
10609,[]
10610,"Only get this game with a large sale. This game is decent only if u only play modes like play now and myleague. MyCareer and MyTeam are some of the most vile and absolutely disgusting modes known to man. They are literally unplayable unless u pay for the godforsaken virtual coins that make me shake just at the thought of them. Luckily I only enjoy the modes that don't require VC like MyLeague which is actually a good mode where u can basically do whatever u want with no restrictions. But if u are coming here for the other modes, grab your kids, pack the bags, and stay as far away from this game as possible. Also the servers are complete shit. I was originally gonna give a thumbs up for this but after writing my thoughts I realized how shit this game really is, they treat basketball fans like complete garbage but we need our fix.

Okay, after adding 10 more hours of this game, it is seriously NOTHING like real basketball. The game has like 3 animations and it is VERY unrealistic. Trying to play this against friends competitively is so bad. Ronnie 2k just picks which team will brick shots wide open right outside the block with not a soul in sight while the other team will hit fading away shots not even facing the basket from a long 2 in the corner with a guy draped all over him. I cant believe these developers get away with this absolute dog shit of a game and I greatly regret ever coming back to this game after not playing for 2-3 years. I will proudly not buy anything from this shitty company and developers again until they stop charging $60 for such an absolute garbage game."
10611,If you plan not to spend any money on the game( on micro-transactions) you can still have fun. Plus you will have the mindset that you don't have to cheat to win. Plus its a dying breed of games that you don't have to kill to win. Unless your killing them ankles.
10612,Glad to say I played. Sad to see it go.
10613,Great game dont listen to negative reviews
10614,"great game

10626,"The singleplayer is fine, a bit different from last year but probably not enough to justify a purchase if you already own 2k19.

The multiplayer is not fine. If anything, the input lag is worse than last year. Now featuring freezes!

If you want a singleplayer NBA game and don't own 2K19 maybe get this. Otherwise I can't recommend it."
10627,if you like nba games this game is for you
10628,"Servers are trash, same game as 2K19, don't care about the community, devs and ronnie constantly lie"

10632,s
10633,Your account get's deleted after 48 hours of not confirming your email address. They don't even inform you that in-game. You are just expected to open your email at some point and hopefully read it. You go to support ask for help but they say its something to do with how I installed the game even though the game itself tells me my account got deleted because I didn't confirm my email. They ask you to redownload and re install 83gb worth of file so casually like it takes 1 min. You don't get to play MyCareer properly because you can't even Sim to your next appearance it all goes slow-mo and you have to alt +tab multiple times to see the button pop out. I have a decent PC so it doesn't have anything to do with my specs. A lot of people have problems with it but the supports just shit.
10634,The Game keeps crashing!
10635,"Disappointed again & again &again. IF I buy 2K21 again,I must be a dog."
10636,good
10637,YES SIR
10638,"Microtransactions are a plague on video games.  This game's online modes (MyCareer, MyTeam, MyPark, and MyGM) are filled with them to the point of the game becoming unfun.  Anyone playing on PC online is basically hacking.  There are so many issues.  Yet it's the greatest offline sports simulation game in history.  MyLeague is worth 300 dollars.  Get it for MyLeague and learn all the stuff you can customize.  Arenas, Jerseys, an incredibly deep player customization system, playbooks, coaching styles, rotations, shot types including a shot creator, an entire new catalog of badge to make players unique and different, custom draft classes including the ability to import any draft class in the history of the NBA, player tendencies, player contracts, coach signings, an extensive training and mentorship system to develop younger players.  To top all of this off, if you don't like any feature there are 100s of sliders to fine tune everything from how teams value players in trades to how teams offer contracts.  It is the most immersive sports simulation in the history of sports.  If they keep MyLeague I will continue to shell out 60 dollars yearly.  The modding community also constantly puts out a slow but quality number of mods.  Get it"
10639,love this game
10640,worth the money and its a lot of fun
10641,good game but its 2k so if you know you know
10642,The best 2K version that I've played. Better than before previous 2K versions of this game.
10643,Fun game
10644,"Game crashes constantly, I got ahold of the customer support and they told me nothing was wrong...  I said well when i look online there is a HUGE number of people on the PC version whos games just crash...   I was like obviously something is wrong...   He tells me, welp your game files are correct your pc is up to date your drivers are good etc etc...  Im like well can you tell the developers what steps your taking to cause the game to crash?   Im like yeah step 1) Play game 2) Game crashes randomly..  hes like ima need a video of this occuring...   I just left the convo at this point obviously no one on the development team knows why bc they havent fixed it since October and its Feb now there has been 10 updates since launch"

10651,I think 2k did a very good job on there game. i am very satisfied with my purchase. there is nothing wrong with the game in my opinion
10652,"Just tried to play myplayer in boom they shut down the server, they could at least update the game to make myplayer still available. So with that said this company is a full scam in needs to be brought to justice for this trashy business. Since they keep shutting down the server every new 2k, you should never buy their games again until they make an offline mode for myplayer, and a class-action lawsuit goes with that. I brought the NBA 2K20 Digital Deluxe Edition just for the server to go down is a waste of money."
10653,Unpleasant Experience all round
10654,good
10655,/
10656,This game always crash when i play online. Can anyone help me to fix it.
10657,"haven't gotten to the online games, been playing solely on the MyCareer, and i'm loving it so far. Everything seems to be in place, the mechanics the AI, everything's good.

Before i bought the game, i noticed a lot of negative reviews and kind of hesitated. But i took a peek on the positive reviews and i'm sold. Now that i've been playing the game, The positive reviewers were right. Don't know where all the hate came from. It's a good game

==================
EDIT :
now i've played the online games, I'M TOTALLY HOOKED!!
Damn the online games are so addicting, i can't get my hands off 'em. The connection thing are a given in any online games, but for someone who used to play online fps, it's nothing new.

a totally awesome game for me!!"
10658,fun
10659,"So much better than the PS3 version [18]. Much more in depth and... The WNBA, too!!! It's graphic intensive, but all are adjustable. Have fun!!!!!!"
10660,worst game i have ever played scam of 60 dollars dont wast ur money i already unsintalled it never going to play it again ronnie 2k terriost is a scammer i hope he gets corona
10661,"Some pay to win features still exists, however 2k20 is closest to succesful real basketball simulation ever."

10663,Best 2k game
10664,NICE GAME
10665,"As of today, my career doesn't work, when you press the button to skip to where you are in the game, you just get a view of the game from behind the bench.

UPDATE
I am still unable to play MyCareer Steam refused to give my money back & EA continues to close my tickets without resolution DO NOT BUY"
10666,pay to win and hack to win
10667,STUPID FUCKING GAME CRASH WHEN I HAVE A GOOD STATS AT MY CAREER AND ITS WENT OFF AND RESTARED. RETARTED GAME
10668,"The game starts going in slow motion randomly. imagine sitting on the bench, unable to skip, and on top of that watch the game, waiting to get on the court in half the speed. Jesus, even for the 13 pound i bought this game for, it still isn't worth it.

Edit - The slow-motion was due to me having a 144hz monitor. if you want the game to run the best it can (few bugs as possible) run it with a 60hz monitor. Just prepare for your eyes to slowly die as you try to get used to a lower refresh rate again..."
10669,good
10670,sssssssssssssss
10671,"Yes, i have just bought this game yesterday, and i think the game is really good, you can skip cutscenes now.
Ive only managed to play mycareer tho. The bug is still there, but minor counts. 
The server is stable, as i dont have any issue playing on mycareer, except (match on the neighbourhood)
The match is good, mycareer storylines is also captivating.

If i have any concern, that would be the very expensive items for you to wear or use in the neighbourhood, just some suggestion 2k, if you would want to make the game as a massively multiplayer, then add some trade-like system or evenmarket between players, so the items that they already bought wouldnt go to waste.

And the grinding will be a long ass run, but im okay with that, for the verdict, buy it straight away when the game is on sale. Cheers"
10672,so many cheater OVR 60 with Demigod mode with really long wingspan
10673,When my controller disconnects the game never detects it once I reconnect and forces me to close it. Do not recommend this game this is ridiculous.
10674,its trash plain and simple

10683,"It crashes a lot, otherwise decent game..."
10684,"NBA 2K20 is a good basketball game that I still recommend despite one rant I do have about it. Some pros first, MyCareer has another solid story-line, MyLeague is still enjoyable as you always have total customization of the team you are running, and the inclusion of the WNBA is refreshing and should be expanded upon in the future.

Now for the cons, 2K totally wrecked the MyGM mode this year. It's tedious, repetitive, and boring. The constant chit-chatting and pestering for trades is annoying and the action points and skill tree concept is very flawed and limits a lot of your actions and you have to grind even more just to get to certain points. They need to make MyGM fun again because 2K18 at least offered a story-line without it becoming too heavy-handed and you still had a lot of customizations. This MyGM is just awful and isn't fun in any way. It's just a grind of talking and chit-chatting with your staff and players and it shouldn't take a long time to simulate through the season either. They totally killed one of the best modes with this new system which shouldn't ever be done again honestly.

Other cons of course are more minor but 2K needs to allow us to permanently save our face scan to the game so it doesn't get lost easily and bring back Create-A-Legend in the form of something like MyLegend. I actually loved picking a random NBA player having a great career with them. So overall, I still enjoy the series but MyGM needs to be fun again at the very least."
10685,dissapointing server
10686,This game was released ages ago and is still unplayable because of bugs and crashes. Last 2k game i ever buy. Money hungry company that doesn't care about the game or the players. I'm so angry that i bought this fraud of a game.
10687,its good
10688,Very good game
10689,"Hadn't played a 2k title since 2k16, and when i saw 2k20 on sale i thought i'll give it a chance on PC. 
Now, i know there is a lot of hate about the servers, the online games experiencing some delay, some unreasonable crashes during gameplay and i have too have experienced all of these problems and got fed up af. But if there is one thing i can tell for sure after 120 hours of gameplay is that if you love NBA you will fall in love with this game. It's got to be one of the best 2k i've played ever. From the graphics to the gameplay to the customization 2k20 is a beauty. The online (when it's working smoothly)  is so enjoying especially if you play with friends and the offline-single gameplay has it all! 
All in all i would give this easily a positive review. I mean if you love ball you gotta love this game."

make up your own mind about the reviews - if you want to play a basketball game no doubt get nba 2k20
get it on a sale , invest some more coin choose the deluxe version. 

you ♥ nba ?!? wanna play kobe shaq , mj or other classic historical or latest nba players in random drafted, original, or choosen by yourself teams ?!? 
nba 2k20 offers a lot of content 
gameplay is great - play some single player games first - check the controls first

single player works great no laggs no tearing cpu usage low on high
multiplayer is fun too my career is like a nba star story . lot of different game modes

no connection problems - registration no problem, takes 20 sec. and you ready"

For a game that comes out every single year, what exactly do you expect? With that being said, I feel like the core of this game is perfectly fine. I'm always looking for a better basketball simulation experience, until then this will work."

10699,"After the recent update, game just kept crashing for no reason. I have a 2080TI, and every other games work just fine..."
10700,I love it! The best basketball game
10701,"Aside from micro-transactions (which the community obviously hates), NBA 2K20 is great for basketball fans.

MyPlayer has a compelling story.  The ""tutorial"" or beginning of your journey into the NBA is about a 4 hour ordeal.  Tryouts. Workouts. Summer league.  It's all there.

Then, of course, it's about a good 20 games into the season that your MyPlayer starts playing decent.  So yeah, your rise to stardom is definitely a grind. You don't need to by VC, but you can.  VC doesn't make you a good NBA 2K player, however.  You'll still need to learn the little nuances of the game.

There's so much packed into this game.  I could write an entire 20 page report.  All I'll say is this; if you have NBA 2K19, 2K18, 2K17, or maybe even 2K16 then pass on this game.  Unless you have money to burn, and you haven't caught up on this gaming franchise; then it's probably not worth the money.  Wait until it's on sale.

When will NBA 2K release a single game and make people pay money for ""seasons"".  NBA 2KUniverse should definitely become a thing.  I'm tired of dishing out $100 per year for the same game over and over."
10702,cfghjftjtdjtd
10703,"I actually enjoy the game. I mainly play MyLeague. My problem is that the steam version constantly crashes during games without even an error message. I will play 47 minutes of a game and it will crash and I will end up simulating/replaying the game I just about finished. (very annoying) There are some other issues with the game as far as lacking design and features. (For example, you must select your favorite offensive plays at the start of each game. Those settings should persist between games in my opinion) They are not deal breakers, but the crashing bugs are not enough for me to choose the steam or pc versions over the Xbox/PlayStation versions. (Assuming those don't crash)"

10736,"Online play is a joke but, if you're looking to play against a.i or offline mycareer it's perfect."
10737,"Let me get one thing straight- this game has it's FLAWS.

That being said, I feel it gets the wrong rep. For instance-

""It's pay to win!""- Not really. I have a really good my team squad with no money spent in just 1 month of playing. (multiple PDs, Full diamond and PD bench, etc.) MyCareer is easy until 95, and its just gaining those last 4 OVRs that can be maaaybe p2w, but it's barley a factor nonetheless.

""PC is the worst platform!""- The ONLY downside I can think of is less players, so less auction house listings. For me, Servers are the usual experience on all consoles, the lag is the same, I have yet to see a hacker in game, etc. Also another downside is no game chat, but if you join a 2k PC discord, this quickly becomes a non issue.

BUT-

The game has it's issues. Look at any of the other reviews and you will see angry customers ranting about Ronnie2k. All I'm saying, is if you buy the game, its not gonna too different from console, and it won't be an endless pay to win casino style grind fest."

10750,2K20 is good if you enjoy offline modes but if you like online gamemodes then expect Microtransactions.
10751,tons of bugs and crashed down so many times
10752,"takes to damm long only option to get better in the hood is to spend money :(
"
10753,AWESOME
10754,The AI’s defence and offence in MyCareer is always trash !!!! even you in best team in the league and your *** teammates plays like highschool !
10755,GOOD!
10756,Best sport sim in the world
10757,BEST GAME ALL TIME OR SERIES OF GAMES FOR BALLERS
10758,trash
10759,"yeah, no"
10760,Lots of fun with a steep learning curve but worth it as wins are hard earned and more satisfying. Shot meter is challenging but with practice it becomes manageable.  You really have to work hard on defense and know the proper time to switch defenders during screens.  I enjoy the realism overall.  Player animations are entertaining as well.
10761,"Game crashes almost every 5 min. 

I have tried every resource online. I have a plenty good pc. I have way more than enough space on my pc. Just looks like 2k being lazy like always. Im going to refund and just play on my PS4 :("
10762,good
10763,epic but kobe dyed lolol
10764,"I definitely think this game is worth picking up. At first glance the game looks similar to NBA 2k19, but it's the details that bring this game apart. I'm still early on in gameplay, but I've noticed some key differences: speed and defense matters.

For example, if one team has a quicker center that can hurt you a bit. I just played the Lakers and they took advantage of my slow center (Gillmore? from the All time Bulls). I ended up countering by putting Horace Grant in at center, but that only goes so far against the Lakers as they have so many weapons.

There is also a 'player DNA' and 'create a player' in league mode in the front office tab.. nice feature.

My Team is also enjoyable. The way you can upgrade key players and they have goals to unlock stars further skills (like Hakeem Olajuwon is the player I chose early on.)

And if your wondering.. I haven't seen any advertisements in myleague mode and the game loads much quicker than previous years."
10765,"I would stray away from buying this game on steam. I have had countless crashes and cannot play the game whatsoever. The longest I have gone without crashing to desktop is 30 minutes. I have re downloaded the game twice and checked for file corruption each time with no luck. I have wasted countless hours and dollars on this game just to get it to work with no avail. I have tried looking for a fix for this but have found zero solutions that have worked. For those that are curious I have an i7-9300, gtx 2070, and 16gb of memory. If any one has any answers I would greatly appreciate them."

10771,Great game.
10772,"cant even play my player, college game glitches out every time and i have to restart. Dont even get a chance to have fun."
10773,ancok
10774,i really like this NBA 2K20
10775,"Honestly it CAN be fun, but it's still full of bugs and glitches just like every year. I bought the game at 50% off because I know their reputation and didn't want to pay full value... looking back at it maybe I shouldn't have even paid half.

The biggest issue to me is the complete imbalance when it comes to shots. You can be wide open, but unless the shot meter lights up green (perfect release), the odds of the shot going in are little-none no matter player ratings. I get not every shot should go in, but it's at the point where it's completely ridiculous now. This happens with layups as well. And as far as CONTESTED shots go... yeah, good luck. Meanwhile the CPU seem to be able to drill shots from no matter where, even contested (to a lesser extent, like it should be with the user-controlled player). This is all especially true in MyCareer because your teammates will consistently force up bad shots or miss wide open ones and before you know it you're down 20.

Ads are still annoying too, do we really need to sit through the players making their way to the bench for a timeout and then five more seconds just so we can see Gatorade pop up, EVERY TIME? And do we really need an express introduction before the game (not every game, but still)?

The animations still seem clunky. When I try to steal my player sometimes goes halfway across the world, AI players will randomly dribble it out of bounds or back across half court for no reason, turning your player the other direction takes three years, etc. Not the biggest issue but something that could be improved (but lets face it, probably won't).

Oh, and the support is horrible. Basically if you have a problem might as well just keep it to yourself and save time trying to find someone."
10776,"Legitimately the WORST 2k ever made . crashes irregularly regardless of following all recommended trouble shooting steps.  comp specs WELL above minimal requirements. my career is so buggy and ever so slightly behind online park/jordan rec/ pro am play for bug infested laggy play. which online my player was the whole reason I bought it. Ungodly amount of cut scenes (no on cares about the generic story line they pull out of their a** every year) Not to mention the shooting (I use steph curry's shot for  the quickness) is so slow getting open is pointless. good defenders always get to contest you even if you shake them and start shooting animation with 10 feet of space. (keep in mind i already have gold quick release). save your money and don't buy it at all. If you must then buy it on console because that's all they care about anyway. Pc servers are the worst, 2k has simply turned into a cash grab this year. Cant believe I'm saying this but im gonna go with nba live next year. (Sad I know)"
10777,I love this game.... But.... it is an absolute cash grab. you will spend money. ALOT of it. I know we shouldn't support games like this but it really is hands down the best Basketball game available. Just be ready to spend about 3x the base price of this game so you can actually enjoy it
10778,buggiest game ever if you want to connect a controller it is very frustrating. dogshit game overall would not reccomend at all!
10779,Every mode works finew accept My Career i still havent been able to play will get stuck at loading screen and I have I7 with 1080 gtx im very upset about to see if I can get a refund!

10802,there is plunt to do
10803,NOTHING
10804,yes but one thing to have good fps in park you need to change your refresh rate to 240 you do it by going to main menu then you go to setting then you go to video setting then everything is there you just need to make your refresh rate to 240 then it is a lot better then console 2k in a lot ways first it is smoother but it looks the same as a ps4 pro severs are still not good but playable mycareer prelude is to long nut after that its a long grind to get the jumpshot creator then the micro transactions are still terrible and the way that myteam is literally a casino is kinda sad because i love going on there and dunking on people with Michael Jordan then the new my player builder is kinda broken because you can make a glass lockdown that can shoot 3s dunk get rebounds and play really good defense then hackers tbh i havent really seen any and if i did there are easy to avoid just get on the spot with them if you know there are one its that simple but besides all of that this a great game its the best Basketball game out there and thats why ill keep playing it

Its clunky and too animation driven.  They may have added badges but they took away at least a few that were good.  They took away ratings.

10831,"Has an unbelievably despicable team behind the business practices and the ads are over the top and nauseating, but what can I say? The gameplay is great and the core game is worth it. If you like the NBA and love the 2k games, this one is by just a narrow margin worth the purchase."
10832,"Look, I hadn't played an NBA2k game since 15. It was starting to go downhill then with the introduction of having to pay for one of the most popular modes MyPlayer. So I skipped a few versions. It's worse than I could have imagined, despite there being a ton of red flags and negative reviews. I only wanted to play the single player offline modes, myLeague etc do I didn't care about microtransactions that I was never going to purchase. Well, because of those lovely evil things, the single player modes have gone underdeveloped and ignored. I love to create an entire new franchise of teams with custom logos and uniforms etc. Except, a small simple bug that means your accessory colour will always be black or blue exists and hasn't been fixed since launch. Meaning the hours I spent building and customizing 36 unique teams has been an absolute mind numbing waste. If you're like me and thinking of buying the game because you don't care about the common shit people complain about...Don't. Everything else is worse."
10833,"Good but not great.. and NBA 2k needs competition to innovate more.. Been playing basketball sims since the sega days, this is the best basketball sim available right now because there is none to compete.. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.."

10855,"Unless you like Complete unfair, repetitive, and tedious grinding, this game is not for you. For me it took me about 50 hours on steam to get to 89 Ovr in My Career alone. Almost everything is behind a huge paywall. For instance I could spend 100 dollars and easily max out a new My career player to the max it can go. But im not a pussy, so I have only spent like 10 dollars on the game. Back to my earlier statement, in case your not aware, I believe the max OVR you can go is 99. Getting to 90 to 99 will most likely take up around another 50 hours in my opinion. Meaning it would take 100 hours to max out 1 character. As for me who actually likes grinding, i believe the amount of time should be half because multiple players want to try different builds and roles."

10860,"Loving this game mode, it's like an MMORPG for basketball"
10861,"its nba, but my team mode is still really easy, i got nearly 200k in the first 3 and a half hours playing that mode lmao"
10862,"Overall it's an okay game, they have made some strides in some areas but fallen back on others. There are too many core basketball principals that they failed on and it just looks sloppy, like the developers don't actually care. For example, the offensive screener in pick and rolls is idiotic and fails to cut to the basket, they often stop about halfway there even if the roll is wide open. Shot profiles for players is garbage too, guy's like Gallo get a wide open shot at the elbow, but choose to do a step thru lay-up from 5 feet out that gets contested and misses. It's also stupid difficult to pull-up/spot-up right on the 3 pt line, you always run about 6 inches past it and take long 2's, which is super aggravating. Guys like JJ and Danny Green always run past the 3 pt line and take long's 2's as well (even as CPU), and it's just idiotic and lazy coding. Pisses me off thinking about it.

-Update  30 hrs later. These developers should be put in jail, but I love bball and can't stop playing despite the rage it brings."

Your ""myplayer"" character is pretty terrible to start with, which I expect them to be for the most part just joining the league.  The problems are exacerbated by the nerfs to xp gains which result in slower and slower ""upgrades"" that really don't do much.  Hey, you got that box out special ability as a low-post player, have fun getting boxed out by a PG or SG and having NO ability to beat them to the ball because your player runs like they have sand in their shoes and they won't ever get better unless you decide to purchase VC to giver your character that boost...

FOR ME TO PLAY A MODE THAT I DON'T PLAY ONLINE WITH. I bought this game on sale even though I regret buying last years. And I regret buying this year's even more.

If you are only playing 2k for Multiplayer and to grind out in the park, listen to the thumbs down reviews, they are right. HOWEVER, this is one of the best mycareer stories they have so far. Before I get hate lets all agree every single 2k is the same, fight for a roster spot, earn minutes yadayadayada. Buy 2k20 if you are looking to play the newest game and from some refreshing UI and cool new features. Is it worth 60$? Hell no, but find this game on sale and its def worth, i bought the legend edition for just 30$ and regular was 20 at the time. Overall 7/10."

10940,"Want to start by saying I am a huge fan of NBA and NBA games, worked myself on some of them over the last ten years.

I really want to like this game but it is INSANE the lack of QA happening with this title. There are so many bugs it's hard to really detail them all but some of the biggest are 

- Every video is literally a green screen of death
- Menus are wildly choppy on a high end system running on SSD, i7, 2080, etc
- Game modes are poorly thought out and clearly designed to force you into micro transactions
- Crowds look like garbage
- Almost nothing changed from the last two years
- Instead of just fixing what was wrong in previous years they layered on more garbage overly-elaborate menus that slow everything down.
- In-game performance is HORRIBLE, choppy and just really poorly optimized for PC 

This game is not worth your money! Wait until it is almost free and maybe they will have fixed some of the major bugs (although it is doubtful).

This game is embarrasing, clealy 2K are resting on their laurels with no competition to speak of in the space for the last few years. Skip this one and let me be the sucker who gave this horrible game my money."

Its a fun game to play with friends but sadly the game would often show players in the neighbourhood frozen and eventually crash the whole game. I wish I can rate this game 9/10 solely because of the single player but with the bugs, crashes, glitches, hackers and servers while playing online; its mediocre. #RIPKOBE #RIPGIGI"

Has some really annoying flaws. The amount of fouls and the stupidly timed timeouts get old fast in MyCareer. MyTeam is meh, its pay to lose lol. Even their deluxe packs are bogus.

Biggest annoyance is how reliant the game is on Badges. 

Everything else aight.

PS. This game has the worst fucking team AI I've seen in an NBA 2k game. Prepare for rage. Missing layups, mid range shots and open shots even with Gold+ Dimer badge.

PSS. There are games in MyCareer that seem rigged for you to lose no matter how many points and assists you get. I went 70 and 14 and still almost lost by 20."

10957,"i like it
"
10958,"I would like to make it clear i only like this game as a offline experience because i really hate dealing with the park/neighborhood sometimes when all i want to do is play a game.

Edit: This game can be very inconsistent to say the least.

I've played every nba 2k game since 16 and honestly game play wise their have been improvements but at the same time downgrades gui wise MyGm looks much better but overall serious downgrade from last years game this years is completely unplayable for me, I just don't like the changes they have made to the level system and how MyGm mode is now a time management/rpg simulator. MyCareer mode as a few dumb things in it but overall an improvement i liked last years choice selection circle better than this year because if you skip through the a part that has a choice it auto picks the first choice in my experience. Skill boost are used in prelude games and since you have to play games the first time you start MyCareer it is a bit unfair. Camera angles in prelude games change from game to game from the one i set. I find without a few defense badges it is next to impossible for me to stay in front of any player even if i turn on the ai assist to max. Scoring is stupid easy in this game if your a slasher and the ai seems clueless on the fast break and worse of all at random defense assignments change at random sometimes but there is a slight improvement to defense mainly you actually contest shots now even if your not assigned to the person so a huge improvement compared to the last few games. I do prefer the new sim process when your player is on the bench because before sometimes you would be up 20 you sit and within a minute of game time you were somehow down 10 so i like that you can watch it or just spend an extra second just to skip like normal but i will add sometimes it seems like the new simulator gui or the simulator itself not a ton of points ever get scored even when 15mins of game time pass a few games i've seen a total of 30 between the 2 sides  in a half  and other times its like 30 points in within 4mins so if anything it just seems really inconsistent."

10964,"I buy this NBA because of KOBE <3 

For Honest Review, Somehow, they change MyGM which is the worse. I love MyGM a lot. Now, I'm just playing MyCareer Mode only. Well, Sometimes Play Now mode with friends. I still Love the game of basketball. i wish, they bring back the MyGM style before. Not this nonsense MyGM in NBA 2K20. I still recommend it tho if you're a big fan of basketball. :)"

10966,"literally unplayable.

vsync doesn't work
putting refresh rater higher than 60 makes the game freak out
if you're on a laptop, it won't automatically select your dedicated GPU
in online mode, there is CONSTANT screen tearing. even if you turn on vsync(tried in game and also tried in nvidia control panel)

10970,"I don't play online. For me, the game is all about MyLeague offline. It's a great mode! When it doesn't crash. The crashes are completely random, and sometimes mean that you can't get through an entire season without having to give up on a save. For a mode that's intended to last for 80 years that's...not great.

The on-court gameplay? Great. Franchise AI? Pretty good. The MyLeague mode is as deep as it's ever been. But it crashes to desktop constantly."

10976,"very fun game and i dont even like basketball that much as far as following the sport, but this is endless fun when you have friends over , throw this on the big screen and crack one open and light up because you are in for a real treat"
10977,"The game is rigged. The ball ONLY goes in the basket when the game lets it. When your playing career mode, you are not able to progress enough to even play a game a make  10 points. 2k makes it so the ONLY way you can really progress your player is to either to spend 20 hr a day playing game in order to get enough vc coins or you have to spend a at least $40 in order to buy vc coins and get enough attributes to be able to play the game and actually enjoy the game.  Also, when your playing career mode, no matter how good you play, if you score 50 points a game, the computer already has decided who is gonna win the game before it even starts so no matter what you do, no matter how good you play, you will still lose the game, and yes, many game 7 playoff games have been lost just like that and who wants to play a game where all the do is CHEAT YOU!DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON ANY 2K GAMES!"

10985,"Now dont get me wrong, this game does have its faults.For me personally this is my first nba game and its definitely worth. I mean like dude nothing beats playing as prime kobe bryant in lakers all time team and breaking those ankles with mamba moves. It feels so good to play those dribble moves and then hitting that three. Sometimes i just pause and go GOD DAMN! Gameplay and animation is smooth as hell. Cant speak much for online but gameplay is 10/10

10991,"This game is great fun, it has very smooth animations and very satisfying shooting system. Nothing tops the rush you get from making a perfect steal, running down the court and smashing a giant and flashy slam dunk. 

This game is good, but I'd say that if you want to play MyCareer I would allocate quite a few hours to getting your character attributes up so you can have a more enjoyable time with the game. Or just do what I did and drop $75 on the game within the second day of buying it and have a really good character with no effort.

But seriously, it's a great game but it has quite a few weird little bugs that can break the flow of the game. I would recommend buying it when it's on sale and you'll have a great time."

10996,"At the start of the new game it seem same old same old from previous games, but this game has its differences in the ways you can build your character in myCareer or the new game modes in myTeam. If you want to play this game I recommend playing it with friends as it makes the game more fun."
10997,"As always 2k is the same, the more patches released the more problems the game endures. In the first week there was a game breaking glitch where players could get to all 99 which makes the park terrible. Matchmaking is non-existant along with several people cheating. It makes me terribly unhappy that this is the ""best"" basketball game. I yearn for the day I die at least then the ghost of a half decent basketball game won't haunt my dreams"

11001,"I've played a lot of 2K in my lifetime. I'm solely a MyLeague fiend and refuse to touch the absolutely infested microtransaction hell hole that is MyCareer and Park. However, this year's entry of NBA 2K does not really improve on 2K19 in any conceivable way for the modes I enjoy. Furthermore, the game is plagued by incessant crashing that just occurs without any warning message despite the fact that I have a higher end setup. I received this game as a gift so I can't say I wasted my money, but if you are thinking of buying it, don't waste yours."

11005,"I like it. But Id say pass. 

The game does require skill, but on that note, someone who is naturally better than other person who has a significant time sync in the game will have better chances of of scoring- 

I dont like the card systems or the grind it takes to get anywhere in the game. -- That part isnt fun. 

Over 17 hours, I did things I really didn't want to do over the things I would rather do, like play online. I feel like I shouldnt play online since I dont have a decent roster to play with."

11013,"NBA2K19 was my first NBA game. So I don't exactly know what is normal in the series and what not. But NBA2K20 is just a copy of the previous one. That alone wouldn't be bad, since I really enjoyed 19 and it was the reason why I decided to buy 20. But they made some adjustments. And those really suck. 

Just a few examples that really bug me:
- The loft and the neighbourhood did not change at all. That hub concept isn't bad but it's just so ugly.
- You can only train in the Gaterode gym once a week now. It gives you a week-long boost, but I liked being able to excerise whenever I want more.
- Team training: Until a certain point you are not able to decide what you want to train on. I'm 10 hours in and still can't do it. It's more realistic if the coach decides what the team trains on, but it was almost the same thing every single time.
- Overall I have the feeling my Pro just can't get anything right. His skill for mid range throws is already good and still he fails even the easiest throws (except I get a perfect timing).
- The team I chose really sucks. And I want to switch. But I not only have to play 10 games before I can do that, but now I have to be a starter. JUST WHY? 
- And the story itself was pretty short. Too short as opposed to 19.

For anyone who has enjoyed 19 and is thinking about buying 2K20 - don't do it. It's not worth it.

I can't give any feedback on the online player vs player part since I don't play that."

11024,"Original I bought it at winter sale when it was 50% off. (when it was still close to 40 Canadian dollars.) I tried MC a bit but decide to refund because I don't feel it worth the money.  During Lunar new year sale, I saw it get 68% off and decide to give it another go since it is less than 30 Canadian dollars. As expect the prelude in MC will take few hour to complete and you will out of luck for refund ( I even skip all the cut scene. BTW not everyone care about LBJ)  I want to play the way I want increase the grid turn out I realize you can't even start MC in offline mode this year.  It is so sad how nba 2k come to like this as I start to play nba 2k on dreamcast.  This will be last NBA 2k I ever buy."

11034,"What a disaster, i saw all the reviews but i only care about MyCareer so i decided its worth getting on sale, people said its the only good mode in the game. Well guess what? 

- If you have 144hz monitor, the only way to ""sim to next appereance"" is by alt-tabing 10-12 times in a row. 
- And if you alt-tab 10-12 times, the game will crash at some point and you are gonna start over and over.

The only way to fix this bug is to put the game to 60hz and turn in V-sync. 

Just trust me, if you like NBA and basketball get the game on Sony or Xbox, they simply don't care about PC. Just unreal what we have to deal with in 2020!"

11038,"dont play it if you cant take a rage. it can really be fustrating at times and more then often it is fustrating but can also be very enjoyable game, so i love it and hate it."
11039,"MyCareer Introduction | 

This game is horrid, I initially got the game for MyCareer however the game mode is terrible, once you enter MyCareer you have to either watch a 45 minute movie with loads of cut scenes or skip them all. The story isn't that great either so I wouldn't advice sitting through it all. One thing that stood out was the Combine, you are tested on your mid range, your catch and shoot, vertical height, etc. These tie together nothing and have no correlation to your player other than you possibly getting an upgrade in your draft projection. I only sit through those excruciating parts to get an extra 750 VC instead of the regular 500 if you were to skip the draft.
VC/Money Hungry Devs |

 Speaking of VC you are practically forced to spend money on the game, especially if you want to play in MyPark/MyCareer. I average 1500 VC a game on 12 minute quarters, and full incentives. To upgrade some of my stats to max (95) I would have to sit and play 24 games. That's just for one. Single. Stat...The prices on the VC are ridiculous, to get a fairly good OVR and a good character you need to spend $50.00 on VC, Unless you want to sit and grind for 30+ hours on each character you create.

MyCareer Gameplay |

The AI is terrible, you are forced to be selfish and get a low Teammate Grade, for example, I play on the Warriors. Stephen Curry one of the greatest 3 point shooters of this era will miss a wide open catch and shoot 3...consistently. If you aren't being selfish your team will chalk up misses upon misses. Each game feels repetitive the AI will run the same exact play system. When I set screens for my teammates they will not run through the screen to catch a defender and make an easy 2 pointer/ 3 pointer. Whilst the other team will go through the screens and run straight to the basket for an easy 2 pointer. When I switch defenders on screens I will still get a ""Defensive breakdown"" when I'm clearly trying to cover someone else to make up for my teammate who got caught on a screen. These are just some of my main complaints, I could go on and on about animations, waiting screens, Questions etc. etc.

MyPark |

Now this could be my PC or the game itself, but inside MyPark it feels like everything is delayed and my frames are super jittery. The whole gameplay even with a controller feels delayed and clunky. Not to mention the toxic builds and the tryhards on the court. As well as the hackers/exploiters. It's so predictable the builds on the game, Glass Cleaning Lock Down, Slashing Play maker etc...You will wait ages for games, and when you do you'll get terrible teammates. It's fustrating as a whole and the clothing in the game is overpriced as well (Not looking like a bum is also very important) 

Other Online Modes |

Other than MyPark I don't play any other online modes, especially since I don't know how to/Don't like them. But also you will rarely be able to find a game. I can't comment much on these

Other Offline Modes |

I'm sure there are ups and downs on those modes however again can't comment on them as I do not play them.

2K as a whole |

It's a very greedy and bad company that doesn't listen to it's community. It instead destroys it by taking out certain things that everyone liked, inserting things that no one wants. And fucking over the community as a whole they are greedy liars who say they will have things in upcoming games and either lie or shy away from the fact that they didn't whole heartedly mean they would add 'this' instead they added something like that but very different that no one wants. In summary this game isn't worth your money if you aren't prepared to deal with toxicity and paying loads of money to make you have a better time and allowing you to play the game in the first place without ragequitting and deleting the game.

I reinstall everything and for some UNHOLY REASON 2k can't synchronize with my steam profile. 250 hours gone. I can't even play the game because there's no OFFLINE ANYTHING! The game says it wants to update but everytime it goes to update it just sits there at 0 or 3%. I went to work for 8 hours (leaving my computer on) come back and it's still at 0% which dashed my hopes of the percent counter being bugged. This whole games a fucking bug. Haven't tried installing an reinstalling yet, but I'll let yall know how that goes. They haven't fixed anything either. God save 2k21"
11113,"Do not buy this game. MyGM is such a chore to play now and you need to constantly maintain relations with EVERYONE. Multiplayer is the same usual garbage as 2K19, MyLeague is meh depends on what you like, i have also recently been getting an issue with constant immediate crashes with no error code or anything for about 3 weeks now. Decent Singleplayer content if you look past the constant crashing and MyGMs chore like gameplay. [b] Do Not Buy [/b] unless it's on a very good sale because Multiplayer is crap and Singleplayer is meh at best"
11114,Its Great For Pro Basketball Player
11115,"There should be a ranking system in the playground or in PRO-AM where players compete at the same league because right now you are 60 overall and you play against 90 or 99 overall and you cant win so that makes it really hard to enjoy the game.
When you play league games tho it's pretty good not gonna lie.
"
11116,"I cannot play my quick play mode, it always crashes once it is loaded 100 percent and also the freestyle mode. Can someone address this problem?"
11117,Some of you are probably going to think I'm a diamond in the rough but I've found this game oddly enjoyable. This has been my favorite 2k in quite some time and yes I do play PC online. 4 out of 5 stars don't know if its because I'm dominating the competition or cause its a solid game but I got it for $30 and cant complain.
11118,servers suck

11150,"I have always had a fantasy about playing in the NBA, this game lets me do it. But it is straight up ridiculous when you make yourself have the attributes of the worlds best 3 point shooters but the game doesn't even listen to your stats, it always has you miss open shots when the release is near perfect cuz for some fucked up reason, when i practice my shots, all of them are green lights, but in games, they are never green lights because this is the worst game in history. Fix your shit game. Please, this is highly unrealistic and completely fucked and buggy. The game category I get most worked up about is FPS, but this game tops the charts because of how nonsensical it is. The game predetermines if your team should win or lose, I have seen on multiple occasions my AI teammates just standing there with their hands down letting any point guard go up for a dunk. And it doesn't matter how contested they are, the AI on the other team can make 3s, but when I designed myself to be a pure shooter, a wide open 3, 1 foot behind the line doesnt go in even though the shot meter is essentially full but decides to not green light. fuck this shit, never fucking playing it again. Not getting next years. I will live out my fantasy in Steph Curry as I used too. Fuck this shit game"

11157,"crashes, controller stops working mid game with no fix, if you do play online its a laggy pile of shit."
11158,"Fuck this game. Don't give 2K your money until they learn to respect their customers.

1. The servers suck. Not only is it hard to sometimes find other players, but even when you do connect the delay is very noticeable, and in a game where timing is key, it makes it unplayable at times.

2. Matchmaking is bad. You either play against someone who'll mercilessly crush you, or someone who just booted up the game for the first time. It's rare when you'll actually compete with someone at your level. 

3. The shot contest system is inconsistent. Even the best players will sometimes miss wide open and barely contested shots, whilst hitting with a lot of physical contact a while earlier. Also, sometimes defenders will give you a high contest even if they're far away from you, making you miss. I understand why you have to miss high percentage shots somtimes, but don't make it happen a couple times in a row. It's frustrating and makes the player feel powerless.

4. The microtransactions are a low blow. Spending a couple of bucks gives a quick, visible advantage. Without spending money, you have to grind. A LOT. It hurts, especially in a $60 game that also shows unskipabble ads. Plus, it's been said that the game modifies lootbox odds by checking how much money you spend - it boosts your chances so you buy more packs, just to lower them when you start doing so. It's all shady stuff.

5. Passing is broken. Sometimes, it looks like it's going to be a clean pass, but all of the sudden the enemy steals your ball. Even when you're wide open and expecting a pass, the player can just get a spasm and turn the ball over.

6. The CPU is dumb. They run the clock down even if they're losing, they walk out of bounds and they give up open looks by double-teaming anyone who scores some points.

7. The park is the same one from last year.

It's sad to see that a game with such a steady foundation and so much potential is used as a cash cow. Let's just hope that they'll fix the series with the next generation of consoles."
11159,My favorite game!
11160,"upgrading is so useless, you've maxed out your attributes you still shoot a 30%. so you need to buy more VC so that 2K will fix this? LoL. no updates"
11161,This game is so fun ya'l should try it/buy it

Wow. First time ever getting an error code..its like the game broke because of my game winner."

11180,"This game is a fucking trash, and its full of bugs. 2K should delete this whole company ..I.."
11181,"Pros:
- Best basketball sim, but there's no competition. No competition has led to...

Cons:
- Terrible anti-cheat system for online play (i.e. no system). It's really a shame that they allow cheaters (some call them ""hackers"") to do anything they want in this game. With some decent play you can outsmart and outplay the average cheater, though often...
- Server lag can preclude you from winning games. No big deal, I'll play offline. Wait! There's...
- Terrible support for pc users. Bugs and glitches can keep you from playing games modes you might enjoy. Maybe you get into a game mode. You'll realize quickly the mode is full of...
- Casino games that elicit gambling addiction for some people. No big deal, I don't have a gambling addiction. Good thing 2k can still pull money out of you through...
- ACTUAL ADVERTISEMENTS DURING LOADING SCREENS THAT ARE UNSKIPPABLE. I don't even care that they flood the game with product placement and amateurish cutscenes pushing gatorade and nikes. Shame on 2k for selling out completely.


I've bought and played every 2k since 2k9. Used to love this franchise. I'm even one of the few that's believed the game has become a better basketball sim every year. Too bad everything else they do gets in the way of that. Someday a company will come out of nowhere and shove 2k's sh*t right back up their a**. I can't wait. When players are cheering for EA to come back and bury your basketball game, you've killed the captain. I can't wait for your ship to sink.

I'll put a few more hours in this game when I'm not so frustrated. But I'll never buy it again -- not the way you've run your business.

Toodles 2k."
11182,this is the worst game ive ever played
11183,fgdf
11184,"This used to be a good review, after playing the game for longer, I've realized how bad it is. Has tons of micro-transactions, get this, I payed $100, and spent nearly $200 just to complete the MyCareer portion of the game. Terrible game, has tons of glitches, really wouldn't recommend it. Save yourself the $60-$100 you're about to spend. (Also, literally never try to speak with support.)"
11185,"a great basketball game if you ignore the horrible ""pop"" and hip culture that surrounds the game and the community, avoid mycareer like the plague and stick to simulation basketball"
11186,a
11187,"This is shit, shit, just shit. A bagged piece of shit. Never buy this shit. Those who like this game are shit-eaters."
11188,They're a greedy and just overall shitty company rereleasing the same shitty games. Oh and it only runs at 60fps and stutters all the time when playing online and will randomly crash causing you to be banned if you are in an online match.
11189,game crashes everytime and theres no actual difference except graphics then 2k19 the gameplays seems pretty much the same to me pretty dissapointing 6/10

11191,"if you already have nba 2k16 dont buy this crap. same old garbage. But sadly, us basketball fans have no choice. I only bought it since I have no nba 2k on PC and I got it at 70% discount.

11199,Great MyLeague mode with some of the best customization in a sports game you'll find. Stay as far away as possible from online play or anything related to microtransactions and you'll be golden
11200,"game's good other than the crashing, recycled content, semi-forced micro-transactions, and random disconnects. single player mycareer and myleague (which are the only modes I play) are fun and enjoyable. the mycareer story was surprisingly captivating for me. myleague is basically the same as previous years except for some quality of life changes, but overall nice. 

not worth $60, but would buy on sale."
11201,it fun ni
11202,this game is complete dog shit. My file got glitched so now i have to download 100 gigs worth of game files just to get my save back. Waste of my time. I restarted the game with an additional 7 hours and now the game has completely been uninstalled. Garbage game. Not worth 60 or 30 dollars
11203,good shot
11204,i found this game as the best among all the games i played and the mode i prefer is my career and yea set the resolution on full window as you might find a problem while simulating for your turn in my career mode and that's all. add me if you wanna do some 5v5.
11205,Keeps on crashing
11206,"I have been playing this game like crazy but there is one huge issue. The error - 726e613d is ruining this game completely for me as well as others I have seen online. I only play this game for the my career and this error makes that impossible. It will not let me load into it. I just dont understand, I have done an amazing amount of troubleshooting for this problem - even as far as completely uninstalling and reinstalling the game completely and nothing works. I hope this issue gets fixed quickly or I am going to have to give up on this game sadly."
11207,"Honestly the worst NBA game in a long time, i have not enjoyed myself on this game due to the bugs we all know 2k will never fix. Im a mycareer only player so i cannot speak for the online aspects of the game. However the constant crashing, the sim to next apperance bug not working, the really crappy name ""che"" the over use of the reporters constantly asking questions and the fact that if you try to play defense you get fouled out and trying to guard slashing guards is impossible since your guy will be fatigued in the matter of minutes of play time. Over all the game play improved however but it was taking one step forward and a bus ride back."
11208,its a good game
11209,eu nao entendo esse hate no jogo sim ele é muito pay2win mas é um jogo muito bom tenho desde o 2k16 a carreira foi muito mlr q os outros 2 jogos que foram bem fracos

11215,it's a different game now! very challenging and fun! i cant even shot or dunk now! xD
11216,buy on sale then it can be worth it if you're a basketball casual.
11217,"Too many hackers, horrible servers, same park as 19"
11218,
11219,"I picked this up off the last discount sale because i wanted to play MC. The story is pretty good but the grind is starting to break me. Its too easy to tell that progression was designed to piss you off till the point to be LIKE F**** THIS S**** I'LL JUST BUY VC!!!!  The AI is the thing that's the most irritating, they D you up like its the final shot in overtime at tip off.  But then your teammates stand around doing nothing or fouling an giving them easy F****** points!!!!  Is it me or is there a plastic bag taped around the rim when its time to shoot free throws, please tell me I'm just trippin...  Hahahahah, whenever I'm close to getting a triple double my teammates join the other team and stop passing me the F****** Ball!!!  I have to admit that i read most of the comments and knew that this would happen but I just had to see for myself. I wish i could get back my 32.7 hrs.  Well I feel alot better now so I'll give it a 3.6/10 for MC."
11220,Game is amazing!
11221,very good game
11222,"This game is pretty fun, especially with friends. I don’t get the negative comments everyone is posting about, it’s a game that is not worth it at full price but on sale is when it’s good."
11223,game is frustrating in career mode and not fair between your team and opposing team. bad shot for your team is a good shot for the other team and your teammate  cant make a shot to save their life unless they are wide open.
11224,:D
11225,This game is and always has been about getting buckets.
11226,"除了该死的服务器问题外，基本上95%左右的初期bug都已经被修复了，所以除了NBA目前在中国的形势显得有些尴尬外，中国小伙伴们可以放心游玩，欧洲，美洲，澳洲，非洲南部玩家无需挂载VPN方可直接连接，东南亚，部分亚洲，以及那位神秘的南极洲玩家，和北非玩家需要挂载VPN。关于新手不太了解第一次玩这个游戏的流程，我简单总结一下，如果您是需要挂载VPN连接服务器的地区的玩家，我建议您选择正规的付费软件，如中国的腾讯加速，网易UU加速，8LAG布卡加速。日本以及韩国选择8LAG也可以，东南亚，北非推荐使用Google官方推出的VPN插件，但是价格很贵，并且最新版本资源很难找到。另一个问题就是关于最近推出的下载更新，如果您的下载进度条一直不动或者卡在某个地方，那么可能是如下几个问题：1.您的NBA2k20与您的steam文件夹不在一个系统磁盘里 2.您没挂载VPN，加速器，或者是加速器加载错误，需要重启加速器或者电脑 3.可能是您的磁盘空间不足，需要调整一下磁盘空间.不排除可能有其他情况，请利用您当地的搜索引擎查找原因和解决办法。

В дополнение к проблеме с чертовым сервером, исправлено около 95% первоначальных ошибок, поэтому, за исключением текущей ситуации НБА в Китае, которая немного неловкая, китайские друзья могут быть уверены, что Европа, Америка, Австралия, Южная Африка Игрокам не нужно устанавливать VPN для прямого подключения. Юго-Восточная Азия, некоторые страны Азии и таинственный игрок в Антарктиде, а игроки Северной Африки должны устанавливать VPN. Что касается новичков, которые мало знают о процессе игры в эту игру в первый раз, я кратко подведу итоги. Если вы являетесь игроком в регионе, которому необходимо установить VPN-соединение с сервером, я предлагаю вам выбрать обычное платное программное обеспечение, такое как Tencent Acceleration в Китае и Netease UU Разгоняется, 8LAG Бука разгоняется. Япония и Южная Корея также могут выбрать 8LAG. Юго-Восточная Азия и Северная Африка рекомендуют использовать официальный плагин VPN, запущенный Google, но цена очень дорогая, а последнюю версию ресурса найти сложно. Другая проблема связана с недавно выпущенными обновлениями загрузки. Если индикатор выполнения загрузки застрял или где-то застрял, это может быть связано со следующими проблемами: 1. Ваш NBA2k20 и папка steam находятся не на одном системном диске. 2. Вы не установили VPN, акселератор или неправильно загружен акселератор, вам необходимо перезапустить акселератор или компьютер. 3. Возможно, вам недостаточно места на диске, вам необходимо отрегулировать дисковое пространство. Существуют другие ситуации, которые не могут быть исключены, пожалуйста, используйте ваш локальный Поисковые системы находят причины и решения.

En plus du fichu problème de serveur, environ 95% des bugs initiaux ont été corrigés, donc à l'exception de la situation actuelle de la NBA en Chine, qui est un peu gênante, les amis chinois peuvent être assurés que l'Europe, l'Amérique, l'Australie, l'Afrique australe Les joueurs n'ont pas besoin de monter un VPN pour se connecter directement. L'Asie du Sud-Est, une partie de l'Asie et le mystérieux joueur de l'Antarctique et les joueurs d'Afrique du Nord doivent monter un VPN. En ce qui concerne les novices qui ne savent pas grand-chose sur le processus de jeu pour la première fois, je résumerai brièvement. Si vous êtes un joueur dans une région qui a besoin de monter une connexion VPN au serveur, je vous suggère de choisir des logiciels payants réguliers, tels que Tencent Acceleration en Chine et Netease UU. Accélérez, 8LAG Buka accélère. Le Japon et la Corée du Sud peuvent également choisir 8LAG.L'Asie du Sud-Est et l'Afrique du Nord recommandent d'utiliser le plug-in VPN officiel lancé par Google, mais le prix est très cher et la dernière version de la ressource est difficile à trouver. Un autre problème concerne les mises à jour de téléchargement récemment publiées. Si votre barre de progression de téléchargement a été bloquée ou bloquée quelque part, il peut s'agir des problèmes suivants: 1. Votre NBA2k20 et votre dossier Steam ne se trouvent pas sur le même disque système 2. Vous n'avez pas monté de VPN, d'accélérateur ou l'accélérateur n'a pas été chargé correctement, vous devez redémarrer l'accélérateur ou l'ordinateur 3. Il se peut que votre espace disque soit insuffisant, vous devez ajuster l'espace disque. Il existe d'autres situations qui peuvent ne pas être exclues, veuillez utiliser votre ordinateur local Les moteurs de recherche trouvent des causes et des solutions.

Zusätzlich zu dem verdammten Server-Problem wurden ungefähr 95% der anfänglichen Fehler behoben. Abgesehen von der aktuellen Situation der NBA in China, die etwas umständlich ist, können chinesische Freunde sicher sein, dass Europa, Amerika, Australien und das südliche Afrika Spieler müssen kein VPN bereitstellen, um eine direkte Verbindung herzustellen. Südostasien, einige Asien und der mysteriöse Antarktis-Spieler sowie nordafrikanische Spieler müssen ein VPN bereitstellen. Wenn Sie sich in einer Region befinden, in der eine VPN-Verbindung zum Server hergestellt werden muss, sollten Sie sich für kostenpflichtige Software wie Tencent Acceleration in China und Netease UU entscheiden Beschleunigen, 8LAG Buka beschleunigt. Japan und Südkorea können sich auch für 8LAG entscheiden. Südostasien und Nordafrika empfehlen die Verwendung des offiziellen VPN-Plug-Ins von Google. Der Preis ist jedoch sehr hoch und die neueste Version der Ressource ist schwer zu finden. Ein weiteres Problem betrifft die kürzlich veröffentlichten Download-Updates: Wenn Ihre Download-Fortschrittsanzeige hängen geblieben ist oder irgendwo hängen geblieben ist, können die folgenden Probleme auftreten: 1. Ihr NBA2k20 und Ihr Steam-Ordner befinden sich nicht auf derselben Systemfestplatte 2. Sie haben VPN, Accelerator nicht gemountet oder der Accelerator wurde falsch geladen. Sie müssen den Accelerator oder den Computer neu starten. 3. Möglicherweise ist Ihr Speicherplatz nicht ausreichend. Sie müssen den Speicherplatz anpassen Suchmaschinen finden Ursachen und Lösungen.

In addition to the damn server problem, about 95% of the initial bugs have been fixed, so except for the NBA's current situation in China, which is a bit awkward, Chinese friends can rest assured that Europe, America, Australia, southern Africa Players do not need to mount a VPN to connect directly. Southeast Asia, some Asia, and the mysterious Antarctica player, and North African players need to mount a VPN. Regarding novices who don't know much about the process of playing this game for the first time, I will briefly summarize. If you are a player in a region that needs to mount a VPN connection to the server, I suggest that you choose regular paid software, such as Tencent Acceleration in China and Netease UU Accelerate, 8LAG Buka accelerates. Japan and South Korea can also choose 8LAG. Southeast Asia and North Africa recommend using the official VPN plug-in launched by Google, but the price is very expensive, and the latest version of the resource is difficult to find. Another issue is about the recently released download updates. If your download progress bar has been stuck or stuck somewhere, it may be the following problems: 1. Your NBA2k20 and your steam folder are not on the same system disk 2. You did not mount VPN, accelerator, or the accelerator was loaded incorrectly, you need to restart the accelerator or computer 3. It may be that your disk space is insufficient, you need to adjust the disk space. There are other situations that may not be ruled out, please use your local Search engines find causes and solutions."

11239,"This game is not only a little better than last year, but the gameplay is amazing offline. The second you play anything other than gm or quickplay or career, the servers decide that maybe they shouldn't work. All games are full of lag. Comparing the ping to other games, this is one of the worst of all time. Its such a shame that this game didn't do well. They have every component needed in a good game, just terrible online experiences mixed with lag, hackers, and exploiters that all just find every possible way to cheat instead of being good at the game. Buy it for solo play, Don't touch this with a ten foot pole for multiplayer. (After playing predominantly MyTeam as well as some GM, Quick Play Online, and Career) This game is 100% pay to win in MyTeam due to both the fact that you can buy a literal all 99 overall team combined with their awful, and I mean ET video game awful, servers. Online play feels like running with a parachute, no matter how fast or well you do something, you will never be going at full speed. My last online game, the servers actually made the game feel like they were going in slow motion. At first I thought it was frame drop, but after checking, I was at a full 165 the entire game. If you are thinking about buying this game at this point in time, save your money and just walk away. Take Two Interactive is one of the most money hungry and just downright abusive gaming companies in the world. If you want a basketball game just buy an older version of 2k, oh wait nevermind, they're all 60 dollars too and they don't even come with the servers online."

11244,"The games system is broken in a lot of ways. Animations are better from previous years however they don't bother to fix the absolute cash grab the game is. They also haven't bothered to make it realistic in the sense that my 6'3 guard who has like 75 strength can't push past rondo unless I break his ankles on HOF because ""clamps"". I'll be like 2 feet away trying to dribble and the game will cheat and slow you down and allow the defender to drain your stamina / etc. They also haven't bothered to fix the game predetermining if your shot will go in or not in my career nor have they fixed shitty AI teammates because EA likes to make you grind more and debuff your potential stats because it's a cash grab. I hate EA and Ronnie for this bs.

Just tried playing another match, the defender spams steal, I can have the ball protected and he'll somehow reach across my body and strip it. God help you if you play against any AI with any defensive stats. The game will cheat you out of everything even if you have badges for the plays you're trying to make. Then on def it'll move you out of the way when the AI drives. You can be positioned perfectly and it'll fucking move you out of the way and let the AI green when you timed the shot contest perfectly while placing perfectly.

11252,"If you want it for the offline play, it's amazing. If you want it for the online play it sucks."
11253,"Rewrote my review after an additional 100 hours.  Still booty.  Developer does little/nothing to improve the game but moves like lightning when they think they're giving out too much in game currency for free.  The multiplayer on PC is basically dead unless you're playing during a peak 2 hour window, and even then, you end up playing the same 20 people over and over again.  I'm not a big fan of the community either.  Discussion forums are also dead, but I think that has a lot to do with mods removing a ton of threads.  I still get a disconnect at the end of about 1/3rd of my games in single player and they don't count.  Super annoying."

myleague and start today keep crashing the entire game for no apparent reason. can't even get through a season on myleague without the game crashing.

dont waste your money, 2k just pumps out the same game every year with some slight visual tweaks. this is a far cry from how good the nba 2k games used to be. absolute garbage/10 would not recommend to anyone"

11265,"What the hell?  lmao this is 2020 and 2k is releasing absolute garbage when it comes to online play because servers are literal garbage.  Career mode and gameplay is fine but once you go to the park it becomes unplayable no matter how beast your pc is.  It either requires godly internet to play or there is something seriously wrong with the servers.  I can't believe they just released this game in this state.  Are they ever going to fix it?  It has already been months and its still garbage.  
They really should be sued and we should get our money back.  
CoD 4 pc has better servers and online play and that game was released in early 2000 lmao.  2k is a joke, they should stop making games and give the job to someone like activision who knows how to make a complete game with online play."

11267,I am just playing my player why i am taking this error (with error code : 04d8c39c) also i have allready bugs so much then my game crashed so much time and fps drops i dont understand you take alotof money every year how cant fix that problems where is your coders i think they are just copy last game codes and just drink coffee i think they should try to fix every part of this game and i want to say when i play this game i just be cancer and i feel so angry i swear i broke some things because of bugs and crashes any way i am just saying dont buy this games every part has bug if you have money go spend other games just believe me this game is trash if you want collect garbage buy and get cancer (worst game ever made...).

11305,It is what it is.
11306,"This is the worst game I've ever played. The game doesn't crash on me like other users, but it stutters 100% of the time. Each second of play time takes about 3 seconds. It's like playing in a stuttering slow motion, and there's nothing you can do about it. Apparently they have no plans of fixing it either. If you wanna play 2k, you're gonna need a console. That sucks because I sold my console before I knew how terrible this game is. They're a bunch of thieves that obviously don't care about their PC customers. If you're not gonna make this game playable, don't  release it. Especially when they charge you up to $100 for it. Total BS, and they should be sued"
11307,trash lag. get latin servers
11308,"quality of nba2k has taken a nosedive over the last 4 or so games, but i keep buying them when they go on sale... the worst part about this game is that the on ball/help defense are both broken so you basically cant keep any opposing player with any degree of speed and finishing ability from dropping 40 on you each game, all on layups/dunks. you can have the best rim protector in the league down low, but instead of playing help in the paint they will run to guard javale mcgee on the 3 line (???). trash game with some pretty broken mechanics; the players feel extremely slow at some times (on defense, mostly) but at other times run faster than usain bolt (cutting to the rim, doing layups, etc.). DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS GAME"
11309,"Good game
Support is horrible though..
Buy on Deals, never pay full price :)"
11310,"Leaving my second negative review of this game.

A 2k employee could sit still in the park and just observe what is happening around them and ban 75% of cheaters that roam the parks. Instead they prefer to ban people who grind VC in order to afford the ridiculous cost of boosts / gatorade. It's very anti-consumer. They don't give a crap about the 2k PC community that grinds park / pro-am without using cheats."
11311,Great game
11312,"Is this perfect? NO
Are the microtransactions ridiculous and killing the franchise? YES
But as someone who's sunk 50 hours into MyLeague if you can get it on sale than I'd pick it up."
11313,l
11314,"ass, full of hackers , devs give no attention, simply trash"
11315,"even though the graphics looks the same as last year, the contents are incredibly exciting. MyTeam is so rewarding, and MyCareer introduces a new build system to make your MyPlayer unique. Even the gameplay mechanics are different from last year.

EDIT : Most unfair game, multiplayer wise. MyTeam got position cap, so u cant put everybody on every position, it's a good concept, but somehow 2k break his own rules. they released fcking lebron james who can run at PG, and nikola jokic at PG???? they will just blow by a small pg like kyrie and rose all day. This game pay 2 win af and u will not have a great day if you try to be a ""Grind 2 win"" or ""sell cards 2 win"" or 'no money squad' etc player on myteam. your strategy will not work ingame when you face those demigods team running lebron at PG, thon maker PG who can dribble better than kyrie and have 99 3s. probably only enjoy this game in MyCareer OFFLINE, cause the online is full of cheaters who can make their bodies look like a giraffe."
11316,"This game is a single player only game and thats not how i like to play 2k mycareer. Only hackers, been that way almost since launch. Never cheated myself and i have a 62% winrate in park and can sometimes beat cheaters from all skill. DJW , SPEED , MONEY, and tons more are known hackers and dont get off the game. If you are not avoiding hackers like the plague you WILL get a hacker in your game 100% that can run, shoot, block, disguised as a bad player, 7 foot 3 freak of nature or normal sized dribble god in your game that has every stat even if thats not their position. Hackers killed the already shit community It had. It is the worst game to play online on Steam. If they do not fix hackers next year then fuck 2k and fuck devs. I will never hack on a sports game cause then why the fuck am i playing a fucking sports game. so fucking dumb dont buy this shit game almost all my hours are on MyPark."
11317,"The mycareer section of the game is pretty fun truthfully, great graphics and immersion. However online is a complete joke. The first month of release there is a lot of players but the player base plummets by the fall. 

Online is full of hackers absolutely full of them. I would estimate that 60% of the players you run into online are cheaters, 20% are brownshirts with no badges, and the other 10% are usually squaded up sweat teams, another 10% are just selfish Iverson or Curry wanabes. I say this as someone with a 60%+ win ratio in park with several hundred games, it can be a complete drag to play. The hackers will never go away and the longer the game is from the release date the higher the ratio of hackers to normal players.

Really stay away from the game unless you are an exclusive mycareer or mygm player.

Gameplay is fun but the online is total trash."

11332,"The game keeps crashing and full of bugs. After playing a game in mycareer, it crashes and says that it has a problem connecting to online services. Thus, in-game earning aren't saved. When I log in again, it goes back to the start of the game. It happens everytime, every 2 days or so. #FixNBA2k20"
11333,awesome
11334,They did really well with this one. Easily the most fun myPlayer to date!
11335,"I need more players on the US West!! The game is chill. It's mostly just 2k19 with small changes (the player build is actually a big change, but even that has a meta wherein it manifests itself as not a big change so only certain ones are played by tryhards thanks to these goddamn YouTubers every year).

I bought a pre-built computer with an I7-9700k and a 2070 Super as well as a 165 hz monitor so this game looks too sexy. The problem is that there isn't enough other players so when I tried going back to NBA 2k19 on my PS4/TV at 60 hz and low response/quality it felt unplayable.

I still enjoy MyCareer and just building my MyPlayer even with less park games. TBH, I don't have enough time to grind Rec Center (nobody plays it in this game unfortunately because we have no people) or park, because of work and school. So I still enjoy the small amount of park games that I get to play in.
"
11336,Regardless of what other people say this game is lit but does lack new features coming from 2k19 or 18
11337,it is good yah?
11338,its fun
11339,this is a great game really good players
11340,"The game is great if you only want to play single player or couch play. I love doing seasons with fantasy drafts to create teams based on my tastes at each position. I do not love the microtransactions, which is why I hated the online team building modes in sports games: they are built for the companies to allow players to gamble on packs, which can lead to an addiction from getting that high from pulling a great card. 

In summary, offline- great
online MyTeam- good luck"
11341,"i cant start the game
"
11342,"unless you're going to make a 2-way something , expect your player to not make a single stop against both iso and p&r game styles."
11343,"Such a love/hate relationship with this game. On one hand, the game-play is the best its ever been. However, just about everything else about this game is cancerous. And unfortunately, there are simply no other basketball games out there that can compete. 

As many reviews mention, the game is designed to encourage you to buy in-game currency. I knew that going in and was willing to look past it for the sake of the game-play. However, this year's 2K CRASHES ALL THE TIME. I have a top of the line rig. I know it is not my computer. A few crashes here and there would not bother me, but this has been consistently crashing for months. 

What's so brutal about the constant crashing in both MyCareer and MyTeam is that you lose your valuable in-game upgrades like skill boosts and gatoraide boosts for your MyCareer player. (which are expensive AF in game) And in MyTeam you lose your entire line-ups contracts. The contracts in MyTeam are bad enough and I hate them so much. But losing these valuable commodities due to crashing is simply the worst. There are days I can't even enter MyTeam or MyCareer modes because it insta-crashes. They push so many damn updates to the game and provide little to no feedback as to what changed or why. 

They have no problem pushing out new packs to purchase every week in MyTeam. But game stability??? FUCK THAT.  Last year the servers were a nightmare and everytime a lockercode came out the servers would crash and you would lose your lockercode or those in-game purchases I was talking about. This year, servers are better but game just crashes.....so we're right back where we started. 

You know this greedy ass company makes tons of money off this game. But its pretty clear they give zero fucks about the PC version. Some of you may remember they even had the 2K19 logo still when they first released this game. 

Buy this shit on sale at your own risk. Only really good for the MyCareer solo play. MyTeam is impossible to compete online because its extremely pay to win. I've also heard cheaters run rampant. :)"
11344,"This game is by no means easy for the casual player. It was designed as a cash grab by 2k, without the ability to CHEESE my career, and the neighborhood. If you are a casual player, like myself, you will find MyCareer to be frustrating, but also far more rewarding without the ROOKIE Level of Difficulty that has been seen in years prior. 
That being said, this game is also one of the better 2k installments for gamemodes like My League or My GM. The gameplay also is as smooth as ever. If you are a casual fan of the NBA, or a die hard fan, you will have fun in this game, so long as you treat it as a grind when you play My Career."
11345,I understand
11346,While there is plenty of greedy bs from 2k I still enjoy the game
11347,"Horribly optimized game, missing no many essential features and options. Graphics are no better than the previous years. If you invest in a custom character expect them to be unplayable once 2k21 is out and your $$$ wasted. Online modes are buggy and rarely work, trying to play casual games with a friend will drive you crazy with the lack of optimization"
11348,"everything, besides the lag from 2k"
11349,A real improvement in the MyCareer and MyTeam modes from last year.
11350,Should be a FTP
11351,"I do not care about the bad reviews, this game is banging. The graphics and the sounds are great, the gameplay is good enough(If u use a controller) and the physics is decent. The only negative aspect that I have is that there are not that many new features, it seems more like a update to nba2k19. But overall it is a great Game
Nevermind whats on top, that I wrote in 2020. WHO TF DECIDED IT BE A GOOD IDEA TO COMPLETELY ShUT DOWN MYCAREER AND MYTEAM. CANT PLAY THEM ANYMORE WHAT A SCAM. THAT THIS ISNT ILLEGAL IS CONCERNING ME"
11352,"I was hoping in 2k20 they will fix the horrendous online input lag, that makes you f**k up shooting blocking, defending essentially everything.
I was so naive, this is basically 2k19 v2.0, they sell the same game every year, without listening to reviews and feedback about the awful servers.
This is really just another cheap cashgrab from 2k.
The only reason I still play it bc I roleplay mycareer mode, and that is at least offline.

[u]Only reason to buy is mycareer, forget online play, input lag is not fixed after years and years.[u/]"
11353,nice
11354,"If you want an official NBA basketball game here you go because this is the only option you have. If you are looking for a next level NBA gaming experience dont even bother with this game. NBA 2K has not changed since 2K13 only difference is a few controls and game modes. I would only recommend this game if you are like me and have not played NBA2K in years (last one i played was 2K14). If you have children i would keep them away from this game because of the microtransactions. This game has a literal casino with slot machines, and really wants you to buy VC. I know a couple of people who spend about $10-$25 a week just buying VC for MyPlayers, this means going into online modes is pay to win and unbalanced. This game also runs really bad and has bugs that have never been fixed since day one. If you run the game above 60Hz there is a good chance the pause menu and simulated events will just not work. 

Sidenote: If you encounter the MyCareer bug where the ""Sim to next apperence"" does not work you have to Alt+Tab like 6 times before it will work."
11355,Played my career loved the game play everything in it is great but there is too many glitches and crashes u can't skip when your're subbed out because the screen will freeze into a crash and sometimes it will crash mid game so until they fix it i won't recommend this game
11356,"Max contact finisher, relentless finisher, dreamshaker still always blocked with all that pump fakes even with pro difficulty. CANT EVEN SCORE INSIDE EVEN WITH MAX CLOSE SHOT. LATE DEFENDER ALWAYS BLOCKS OR ALWAYS MISS FOR MYPLAYER. A game you can't enjoy farming the currency cause you can't even score or defend. badges are everything in this game and point guard is the most and easiest to build."
11357,"I really like this game, I saw a lot of people saying its 2k19 2.0 but other than the park being the same this game has a much better feel to me. The overall game is more difficult but in a good way. If you try and force plays or try to jack up shots while being double teamed you're not going to have fun and you're not going to win many games. Once you learn how to shoot which is also more difficult the game gets a lot better. It was frustrating at first because I was use to 2k19 but again once I learned how to play this game and started actually running plays with the team I was hooked. I can't speak about the online play because I only played the my career part of the game. If that's what you like then you should buy the game. There is a ton of cool interviews and moments outside of the basketball court that you get to do. One thing that did suck was not being able to get shoes for free, you get 1 pair when you first sign with a shoe company and then another when they ask you to design a pair. I liked in 2k19 when you got to a high enough level all that brands shoes were free but thats a small thing that i didnt feel took away too much from this game. Overall a really fun game if you want to take the time to learn how to play it."

11381,"Don't get me wrong, the game is amazing the features and the gameplay, and the my career story is the best by far. The only problem for me was the fucking defense in my career, at a very low overall you wouldn't be able to do jack shit, I played against Ricky Rubio and the Suns, and Ricky would be up my ass all the time, dodging every screen and he's always infront of me, sadly you couldn't change their defense in the settings. Other than that this game is amazing in single player."

11400,"I played this game for more than 100 hours. Overall the game is good, but for what is ""MyTeam"" in this game? that's what I confused from the NBA 2K13 era to the NBA 2k20. I'm sure many NBA gamers don't care and don't even play ""MyTeam"". Players definitely play ""MyCAREER"" more often because it's not boring. I hope in the NBA 2K21 game there is no more ""MyTeam"", it's no use. Just make it saturated and influence reducing sales in this game. 

I have to give a dislike review because ""MyTeam""."

They butchered MyGM mode and your MyCareer characters are limited, meaning they cannot achieve things with the same measurements that real superstars are able to do."
11417,good
11418,"My first review for any game and I had to make sure to not recommend this game. I bought the game on sale and it's still not worth the money I paid. You HAVE to put the game at 60hz and enable Vsync, if you don't your MyCareer games will not sim properly when your player isn't in the game.

Holy moly is this just one big Mobile microtransaction game. It's what it feels like to me, the graphics look just like they did when I played 2k16. I get that the game is made to be played with a controller, but if you even feel like using a K+Mouse, do not even try it. Playing in my neighborhood was just me getting disconnected my first 3 games before I was finally able to play with the 8 people running around and then disconnecting again.

The ""story"" for my career was shorter than reading a Haiku on twitter. Do not waste your money, you'll get more enjoyment watching NBA highlights on youtube than playing this game. 2k and almost all of there games have now just gotten horrible and laced with microtransactions."
11419,Very good game
11420,gg
11421,its good
11422,cant play because of hacks. man if im paying a fucking 40 dollars to this game there is no fucking way people can cheat with cheat engine lmao just add a anti cheat lol.
11423,"i know this game gets alot of flack but i really think the actual gameplay is the best its been in terms of animations, shooting mechanics and defence. i only play offline and myteam as ive never liked myplayer. its only pay to win if you have no patience as i was able to get 1,000,000mt in about 2 days without spending any money."
11424,no
11425,basically the last game but new rosters ripped off like usual hoping they learn their lesson
11426,yes
11427,"Bugs beyond a humans thought capacity, the amount of my career games i finish 4 quarters and out of nowhere the game crashes and i have to play it again is very high. 2K needs to realize that they actually do have players on this port that paid the same $60 dollars as all the console folk did and fix our port the same as they fix theres."
11428,Non realistic
11429,Another great Career mode this year.
11430,"very good game
"
11431,"Best sports game on the market. Looks good feels good. A wise decision to buy a game, a fool to spend inside the game."
11432,"5 Star
"
11433,"People are saying that the offline/career mode is great. I have to point to a few things I noticed half-way into a career season with an ""all-round"" PF:

- My player cannot defend. 
-My team cannot defend.
- The opposing team will score no matter what.
- My player cannot dunk - in spite of being 83 rate. He will attempt a lay-up in 9/10 cases in front of an open basket.
- The game is played in such a fast pace that things like setting up screens have become almost obsolete.  It's basically running around the court and going for layups. That's the entire gameplay. I can score 40 points with 80% by just outpacing everybody and going for layups...on an All Star difficulty as a PF. 
-Passing has become totally random. I can make great passes I did not intent to or terrible passes I did not intend to either. Shooting is even more random.
- Games are even more lopsided/rigged than ever before. You can play great and lose by 20 or play terribly and win by 20, as if an invisible hand is controlling everything ( while still gatting a performace of A+ everytime which is another thing they messed up on 2k20 ).
- Post moves are much less effective than before.
- Grinding has become even steeper than before.
-Everything in this game has become more boring.

There are other annoyances, like three-four different interviews after every game where you are basically asked the same things, a glitch where my name is not showing in the stats and the announcer would ignore me as a result - as if my player is invisible - and if i go to the team card all the attributes of all players are shown as F. And that is what I noticed after playing 1/3 of a season in the career mode.  I'm sure there are lots more issues.

This is a broken game and the worst NBA2k game to date by far. It's NBA2K19 2.0 - as they changed nothing visually from the previous instalment other than bumping the models a little - with a totally broken gameplay. It's also a big commercial flop, no surprise that is is already half price on Steam. I do not understand how a broken game like that can get good reviews by critics. Or maybe I do. 
It's the last time I spent my hard-earned money to buy a game out of this franchise. Even if the next instalment is a masterpiece I won't bother.  It's a shame that there's no alternative basketball game and  hence no competition for PC users. Visual Concepts has broken this game to the point that it has become unplayable. It's not just the glitches or the online issues, it's the gameplay ITSELF that is terrible. It came to a point where I'd rather play my Team than my Career.

In short the franchise has become nothing more than a totally unimaginative money grabber. This game should have never been released in its current state. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy and I'm really sorry i made the mistake of buying it. I'm going back to playing NBA2k19 which despite its glitches and annoyances had solid gameplay."
11434,yes
11435,I think this one is the worst game I've ever played than nba 2k before (nba2k19)
11436,ntaps
11437,"It's another NBA 2K game. I honestly never really get disappointed because I don't play online (because playing with guys that are dunking like Vince Carter with moon shoes on isn't really what I call basketball). MyCareer is mainly what I enjoy and.....yeah you still start out like a college phenom in the prelude then turn into someone with cerebral palsy that scored a spot on an NBA team once you start playing in the NBA (like honestly you cant take a slight bump without bumbling over like a giraffe on ice, but I'll chalk that up to feeding the VC crap). Some animations are god awful like some attempts at shot blocking and rebounding when your stats are on the lower end are honestly......let me just say a live human being would not jump like that. TL:DR It's 2k chances are if you like basketball you already have it anyway. I got it for $30 so it was worth that."

11443,"This is just another pay to play using a deceptive model.  The solo play is subpar.  Shooting is a joke both in solo and multiplayer modes.  I've tried turning graphics down, running hardwired, etc.  Still laggy input, I have no idea how the other people are able to get green shots from anywhere on the court almost.  I'm not pro by any means, but I'm also not a total noob.  The career mode is freaking atrocious.  I find that I want to jumpout the window waiting on stupid sequences and cut scenes that won't give the skip option.  Then the neighborhood...omg what a joke.  You basically are going to be able to spend all your time grinding in mycareer, or hoping for lucky card packs in myteam.  Just a total waste of money and very disappointing."
11444,2k is lit
11445,got banned for hacker hacking me and didnt get unbanned
11446,This game is BROKEN af. STROBE warnings needed. DO NOT PLAY if epileptic. All cutscenes replaced with obnoxious green and pruple screens. I might keep if the gameplay is good but WOW does EA not care. Only bought because sale. Probably not worth even 30 bucks but basketball games blow and there's nothing better.
11447,"I normally do not write reviews but I am quite disappointed with not being able to connect to the 2K server. Normally, it is an awesome game. My player mode is really fun to play. However, it loses connection all the time and there is no option of playing it offline. I tried everything suggested by the 2K website, tried different computers and nothing worked. In the rare times where I am able to connect, the game is disconnected at the end of a game so I lose  all progress. This is really frustrating. It is really mind boggling how 2K can prepare such a good game and offer such a terrible gameplay experience."

11462,"This game is honestly the definition of a monopoly. There is no way a game like this would stand to exist if it had competitors. There are legit mechanics in the game to stop you from having fun if you haven't paid. This game is priced at $59.99, but if you want to PLAY the game you'll need to spend around maybe $120 extra. There is even anti-fun mechanics in other game modes besides MyTeam and MyCareer which, to no one's suprise, are the only two modes with microtransactions! If there were any other competing basketball games out there I would prefer them over this app store game."
11463,"這球遊戲操作難度太高, 新手沒法玩, 也不適合給沒辦法花大量時間玩的玩家, 讓人不開心

11472,"As someone who doesn't play an ounce of online and has this game purely for modding and MyLeague, this game is perfect in a lot of places but still lacking.  MyLeague has been the same for 3 years and sees no updates, game-sound is spotty in places, and the game's presentation is spontaneous in some places but buggy in others.  All in all, I wouldn't get this experience anywhere else.  This game is good, but mods make it great.  If you're an NBA enthusiast, buy this game and download some cyberfaces. :)"

11508,Very sad they just reused everything from the previous year. Many mistakes in the game for example being unable to skip to sub myplayer in the game even after fiddling with the settings. They are more hungry for money than giving a better experience. I used to enjoy 2k in the early 2010s. Online gameplay is lagging. I will not be purchasing next year game unless they take their time to really update their system or just update 2k20 to the next season instead of trying to release a brand new game.
11509,Yes its very good

11513,"Decent - so far, so good. Gameplay is ok, MyCareer should be focused more on game itself, less on Hollywood aspect."
11514,NBA2K19 was better but if you can get this game for 10 euros it a steal.
11515,e
11516,Even though the game is a pay-to-win one it's still good for those people who likes to grind everything
11517,"All of the following points are my personal opinion/experience.
This game was more enjoyable for me compare to NBA 2k19. They improved some aspects in gameplay. They experimented new systems, and it turn out not so bad. The thing is, every year, people always complain about 2k, there's still a lot of dumb glitches, mechanics for sure. But overall, this game is not so bad, definitely recommend if you're interested in the NBA. (not like you have any other option anyway)"
11518,Not worthy
11519,Getting Better !!!
11520,"Honestly, bought this game only for the improved singleplayer gameplay (so I heard). Wouldn't have bought this game if I were to play the park, only wanted it for MyLeague and solo MC. The game would. not. stop. crashing. No matter what fix I freaking threw at it. Tried literally every option available the game would somehow find a moment to crash on me until I just straight up requested for a refund after a few hours of trying. Trash man. Only wanted to play singleplayer too. 2K is such a terrible company when it comes to putting their player experience at top priority. Money and greed has already consumed them. If you want 2k20 for singleplayer only on PC, I'd say go for it, but if it starts crashing like it does for a lot of people (including me) then stop asap, and get your money back by requesting for a refund. Crappy game, crappy developers. Back to editing rosters on 2k19 I guess."
11521,"I got it for 50% off, which is actually what this game is worth.

"
11522,GG
11523,poor quality almost everywhere in the game
11524,Good Quality
11525,This game is very broken on PC. I wouldnt recommend purchasing this until they fix MAJOR issues.
11526,"online unplayable, singleplayer stuff is fine"
11527,I like the game just I say get a controller and play it its way better unless you feel like playing on keyboard and mouse up to you
11528,"The shooting is atrocious.  I don't know why they had to make your MyPlayer attatched to an online portion.  They could have had you able to set a difficulty to easy and have MyPlayer seperate and then have all the other online stuff separate.  I don't want to live my life grinding out a game when by the time I even get halfway to where I want to be you will be coming out with another version.  Give us back the option to dominate if we want.  Animations in this game make it way to difficult to get open shots off, it almost seems as if my guy when wide open and waiting to receive a pass decides he's going to go slow motion and not take advantage of the d.  If I were really playing at the level I am at I wouldn't even be close to playing in the NBA.  Give us the option to stay in the G-League and play a couple seasons so we can build our guy or put us in college.  I've been consistent with my shooter on release but I can't ever seem to get greens consistently.  It seems very rare."
11529,"Imagine buying a sports game in 2019 for 60$ JeJ.

-MyLeague is MyLeague
-MyCareer seems prgood
-Graphics are fine
-framerate is good even on a dogshit CPU
-progression is fine but is slightly slower than you would prefer but it can actually make you play through more than just a few games just to not be Anthony Bennett 2.

Yep, it's a sports game in 2019"

11542,"I spent 200 hours grinding my player to a 97 ov, every once in a while the game just kicks you out of your games, and you can't do nothing about it, the only fun part of the game is laughing about how bad it is the game actually. And you can just play park or rec if you have friends, or a good team otherwise you just can't win, because this comunity has de worst selfish players ever. And it's not the fact that you can't win, is that you can't just even play if you have bad rep, because no one wants to play with you.
I started playing 2k in pc since 2k15 and it was good sometimes, i still manage to have over 80% winrate with one friend and randoms, They have the same mistakes that they had 5 years ago. Only the super tryhard players can win or if you have a squad, if you don't have anything of that just go play offline. Or even better don't buy this shit."
11543,"As far as basketball games this is the best on the market. Unfortunately the devs take more of a focus on making money than making their game better. NBA2k gets a little better with each game gameplay wise but it's still not really a good ""basketball"" game"

You expect me to pay $60 on a game that is less than optimal with the controls for my system. Basically if you do not own a controller for your pc i do not recommend you buy this game.

My Career 7/10 - features were fun but the story cut scenes were too long. i felt like i was watching a movie when. i was meant to be playing basketball.
the force ad's between each game were 0/10 - no one gives a fuuuck about AL Horford trying to adapt to the game.

- small amount of players on PC platform

11579,"It's pretty clear 2K doesn't care about customers, just the money. There is a lot of stuff in game that is reused from last year and or the year before. The playground is literally copy / pasted from previous years. 

The entire game is geared toward getting you to buy their virtual currency, VC, in order to get anything done in game. Want to spend all the attribute points you've earned to level up your character? Impossible without buying a ton of VC or grinding an entire season and even then you won't have enough VC to spend all your points. Want clothes so you don't look like a newbie scrub in the park? The prices of clothing is INSANE. Literally 20-30$ of real money just for 1 shirt. Same thing for gear to make your player look more authentic in league games with elbow pads, knee pads, shoes, headbands, etc. all WAY overpriced.
 
2K's Lead promoter Ronnie2k stated before release that the park was different this year AND that you could respec your myplayer saving you a ton of VC, yet upon game release NEITHER was true. This guy has a HORRIBLE reputation in the 2K community. 

Also there are numerous bugs that still exist that have existed since launch. Pretty pathetic.

This game could be amazing and fun for everybody if they DRASTICALLY toned back the need to buy in game money. They REALLY need to add the featrure mlb the show has where you carry your myplayer from game to game each year."
11580,"The same as every year... The single player modes (the only ones I care about) haven't really changed, especially MyCareer still suffers from online-kind-of-game restrictions. The teammates are still inept (sometimes it feels like the developers have never even seen a basketball game). The game simulation has been the same for a decade now, with the same kind of broken mechanics (for example teammates that hold you up in your defence much more, than a pick by the offense does). The drag with warm-up and cutscenes are real again... And again, I bought it (for a massive discount, but still). I'm finally giving up on NBA 2k from now on. I'm hoping someone, someday will put out a rival product, so 2k must stop their milking for cash of dumdums like me with no effort on their side to actually make the series better."
11581,I would recommend solely for the offline career mode usage. Anything online is still not worth it in my mind as the lag is pretty horrendous.
11582,"So like, the only reason I buy NBA 2K is to play my career. From how much I got to play progression seems a bit better than last year. HOWEVER I can't f*****g play it. If I run the game at 144hz I can't skip to my next appearance and just have to watch the whole game unfold. If I limit it to 60hz, it allows me to skip to my next appearance after I alt+tab twice, BUUUUUT the game just crashes after 2 minutes. So all in all, not worth the headache."
11583,gud game
11584,If you are playing MyPlayer then definitely its worth it but every other game mode is either awful or P2W
11585,Deadass was jus playing today how tf my game uninstall itself save ya money
11586,Great NBA 2k games . must have
11587,"Gameplay is cool except for the usual microtransactions and the unskippable crap. That is until you play my career. It's an overtuned pile of dog poo.

Locked into Pro difficulty or higher
When you get subbed the computer goes on 10 point or more runs.
One little skill move by you or when bodied by defenders, that stamina bar melts quickly.
Meanwhile the opponent AI, runs thru and around screens full speed with no fatigue hit or slow down.
When you get screened whether a big or small guy, you're character flies feet away or gets stuck.
When you screen you barely bother the NPC, and it's teammate covers instantly.
The computer does not miss free throws 9 out of 10 times even if that player sucks in real life.
If there is a big even 5 feet from paint you are getting contested on drives.
I could go on and on about how the AI is superman and you are high school scrub.

I don't play online so can't comment on that. I only got this for a xmas present cause it was on sale. But I think this was the last straw. Sale or not, I will not be getting future NBA2ks until I see raving positive reviews across the board and all this MT and overtune crap is gone. Hopefully EA makes a better live and on PC next year. They are probably no better than 2k if they had no competition. But competition will keep both in check somewhat. Let's hope a new company creates a basketball game that is consumer friendly not consumer terrorist.

I wanted to give game a chance cause don't like depending on others to form an opinion. But man most negative comments are all true.."
11588,Game is still unfinished. The double teaming is so broken you get stripped just about any time you score 30. The build system is worse than 2k19s in my opinion. There's only like four real builds to play with. I'd be playing 2k19 right now if the game didn't crash on me on start up every time. I would recommend either: Buying 2k19 or waiting till this game is on sale which will probably be soon due to how poor the game is. I mean it's already been on sale like three times and we're barely about to be in January.
11589,Pretty Good. Realistic
11590,just connect a controller and its fun
11591,"I only get it to play to play franchise type modes.  Its basically unplayable as is.  The sliders must be tweaked in order to have it play right, or so i'm told.  Every time i try to look for sliders uploaded by other players nothing comes up.  Most people don't bother updating the sliders they post on the forums.  Why bother when you can download them.  So i have yet to really play it because as is it totally sucks and i'm tired of hunting online for some updated sliders......I shouldn't have to work this hard to play a game a paid so much for.  Basically, don't waste your time on a game that 2k expects the player community to fix."
11592,gud
11593,"Gameplay itself is great, MyPlayer Builder this year is really nice. Everything else around it not so much. Don't expect to get anywhere without microtransactions. Essentially is a roster update with a couple new features every year."
11594,"The game is disgusting. There is no option for a casual player wanting to just enjoy playing. Shooting., crossing etc are ridiculously hard. And myCareer...for real who designed this? You get a player that can't even make 1 shot or cross anyone and you ""enjoy"" grinding or buying with EXTRA money so you can make 1 shot. Next year time to give NBA Live a shot i guess."
11595,it gets boring over time
11596,"right now i am getting a error on not being able to join Mycareer
"
11597,"If you just focus on gameplay, this game is really good. But the only thing that bugs me is that you can't use your own roster on playoff mode which is the only mode I play. I have been using Limnono for the last 2 years as 2K wouldn't allow customized roster on playoffs."
11598,k
11599,its very fun highly reccomended
11600,"This is a disgrace
I never write reviews on games since I don't feel strongly about any of them to do so, but this is just over the top slap in the face from them.
I play mostly offline MyGM as a chillax gameplay, but that mode is completely f***ed this time around, it doesn't allow you to simulate to regular minutes if you play 6 mins quarters and your player scores 25 it will stay 25 and will not be simulated to 50 making it impossible to stand out in the crowd or break any of the NBA records.
Also a cannot skip commercial at the beginning of EVERY DAMN GAME in the GM series is the stupidest and the most disrespectful things I have ever seen in any of the games.
It is a shame since I loved NBA, but this year is complete and ultimate garbage!"

11608,"I think in general it's a good game, that's why I recommend it to you but I think there is many things they need to add.
I mean is that it does not really feel like the game is completely done. For example if i'm right there is only 3 difficulty levels which I think is kinda bad. I also feel like the easiest difficulty level is too hard for begginers and the hardest difficulty level is too easy for the pros.

But since I don't play this game so much, I belive it's a really good game. 
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/10 stars

11621,Crashes constantly. At random times. I have done everything under the sun to try to fix it and still it continually crashes. Been out for months and still broken. What a crap game.
11622,"Always crashing for no reasons and game is ridden by micro transactions and ads...2K gotta do a better job because this is getting annoying!

UPDATE 02/2020: The game crashes if it thinks your cheating or altering stats in MyCareer or PARK. I played at least 12 games full quarter length for this experiment. Some players just get a lead of 25 and SIM til the end to make easy VC but if you play a full length game you'll know what I'm talking about. NBA 2K implenment a system where if you win too much you should lose some. For instance, lets say you play a couple of games and you SIM some games the game will not crash but your player stats percentage's and tendency will lower and practically you'll suck from some hot/cold zones. Player efficiency will also be affected and by doing this you of course lose games you might not want to lose but do and it could be a losing streak no more than 5 if your team is decent or sucks. 2K Interactive designed the engine so that it'll help players SIM so they could time manage but ultimately breaks the game coding.

Lets get back to where I left off from playing 12 games straight. So i play my first couple of few games and I'm scoring like a pro with good stats like in shooting and rebounding etc...my stats percentage are now higher and better and also haven't lost any game's so far. Continuing to play and we get to like the 4th game, suddenly A.I's starts making all of their shots like perfect from the floor and now your team can't make anything and is in a slump. Continue to push on and get the good stats like usual and suddenly NBA 2K will just crash in-game without no error, and now practically your basically playing the same game from before now with random stats adjustment. What the game engine thinks now is that you should not be winning but losing instead and your stats must be lower than the expected."
11623,Ingore the micro-transactions and the random glitchiness of the cut-scenes and the game plays well.

11629,I like the game but I wish I didn't get it for PC. It is so laggy no matter what adjustments I make. My rig is more than good enough but still no matter how much I adjust it still lags. I'm strictly an offline player too and it's still laggy. I wish I could get a refund.

11631,"Seriously... ppl are ridiculous. I bought this last week and absolutely love it! That being said, my main game modes that I play are MY CAREER and MY GM. It's got a solid story... much better than the previous years. And feels very realistic! Sure, it's got a few bugs here n there, but nothing that breaks the game or my immersion. And yes, it's got lots of micro transactions. I bought 35,000 VC for my career, but i didnt feel forced. Don't wanna buy? THEN DON'T! It's playable whether you buy or not. Just wish everyone would quit their b****ing and just play the game."

"
11638,"In the 23 hours that i've played this game, it has crashed about 20 times. It is completely up to date and i have fine internet connection. I dont know why it keeps crashing it's not my computer as other games don't crash.

Even at 50% off i would not recommend this game, especially if u have any of the 2k series over the last 3-4 years. Same stuff different skin."
11639,"its big baller
"
11640,"A lot of this game's (and series as a whole's) problems are rooted in how the animations flow and the success of certain animations that are practically nonsensical.
Beyond that it's insistence upon itself while also having a higher and higher hill to climb to obtain VC for your myPlayer every year is just more and more ridiculous.

updated jan 31 2020: This game, while having some interesting things that differentiates itself from 2k19 and previous 2k entries, brings A LOT of terrible balancing issues and bugs to the forefront.

The developers are more interested in adding more items that you have to purchase in game currency for (or grind out game after game to afford them) than they are of fixing these bugs.

If you play with sim stats on, like i do, simming a partially completed game will result in ABSURD statlines for your players. For example I just simmed a game i had 3 minutes left in wherein Robert Covington hadn't scored a single basket, looking at the stats after the game he had dropped 25 points. I looked further and what would have been 6 minutes left in a game resulted in ~25 points for both teams. In a blowout game with that little time remaining that's absurd.

In myplayer when you play full length 12 minute quarters more often than not, the opposing team will not call timeouts. you'll end up getting games where you are forced to call time outs to replenish your players stamina to keep going, just the other day with 1.5 minutes left in the 3rd quarter my team, who held a 20 point lead had two timeouts remaining whilst the other team hadn't called a single timeout yet. Really? come on. How are you gonna call yourself a basketball simulator when little tiny things like this are ALWAYS popping up.

The Drills you run to gain XP points towards your badges are often riddled with bullshit. Often times you'll be doing what they ask of you only to be hit with an X and not getting points towards completing your drill.

I'd only recommend getting this on a deal, don't give 2k more money than they are owed. The only thing this game has going for it is that it is somehow still better than the NBA live games.

Update 4/22: I continue to play this due to my love of basketball. I can only suffer a game or two at a time before I get enraged and turn off. new gripe though: I have had to repair the installed files now 4 times total in the 4 months I've owned the game. Every now and then i experience a bug where it will not show me menu icons so i have no idea where the cursor is at. this will not be fixed unless i verify the games files. I have no idea why it's happening but considering this is a 60 dollar AAA title, I don't think this should occur, amongst all the other ridiculous bugs here and there.

another bug that's been pissing me off lately is that when you succesfully challenge a call, the camera will stay on the coach until about a second or two into the live ball. Therefore, if there is a tip ball or free throws, whatever, you cannot see what you are doing until the ball is live. From a TV immersion standpoint? sure, neat, who cares, but in pivotal moments this can make or break a game. so fuck that shit."
11641,good game
11642,this game is the same as last years but its still pretty nice
11643,"Single player is super fun, story seems good so far. Having a blast."
11644,YES
11645,this game is very good if you are only looking to play the single player modes
11646,this game is terrible and is flawed with many glitches and issues for example the game locked and would not allow me to update it.
11647,fun
11648,"Fun game, servers can be laggy (park) would recommend getting when first comes out as most ppl by december are 90+ overall."
11649,"Really hard to set your control key using my laptop. The 2k17 plays better than this.
If I get a refund that would me nice."
11650,"It's good. For those that want to play online head to head, sorry this isn't the game. But, if you are looking for fun single player action, or play with a friend, this game is excellent. They took out a bunch of the BS that made 2k19 miserable. The MyTeam experience is back on track and easy to get into. You don't have to play online at all if you don't want to. Lebron's production company helped out tremendously this year. They copied the dreaded EA Madden franchise in every way, but it's simple, and it's easy to navigate and understand objectives. Honestly, I should have paid the full price when this game launched. The MyTeam market is saturated, and the MyCareer story is fun enough to get into. For a discounted price, this game is excellent."
11651,great basketball game!
11652,VERY GOOD GAME.
11653,u need to play this game w mods without mods this shit is ass

11663,"Added on 25/4/2020: 

It's been a few months since release now and there are still games in Rec where a 7'3"", 290lbs Center is the fastest man on the court. 

That's all you need to know if you plan on buying this game to play online. 



Original review:

Definitely don't buy it if you plan on playing online. It's a 60-dollar game where cheating is rampant and the gameplay is reliant on animations that seem to happen more frequently the higher your rating is. The inconsistent physics of the game will make you want to pull your hair out. On one possession there is body contact, on the next you may see a player phase through you, a rebound may seem to be in your hands but oops, for some magical reason it's not, you may try to apply pressure off-ball by staying in front of your man but though magic he's able to ignore any contact and catch that pass directed at him, passing lane steals are a joke etc. There's way more things that I'm probably missing, so please, chime in.

Rec rant:
I'm sitting here game after game in Rec trying to figure out if I'm taking crazy pills. Seeing tall PF & C builds going coast to coast for dunks, with crazy handles while my undersized PF tries to catch up. I'm trying to replicate their builds in 2klab trying to see if they should be this fast, if they should be dunking over others or hitting contested shots etc etc and there's no way they should be doing everything this well on the court. 

This game could be fun and I think that's what the majority of us playing this online are hoping for; that the next match MAY be fun IF: 

a) they don't get matched against 99-rated players who play zone defense as if they're playing for a million dollars so they try to exploit everything exploitable in the game, trying to showcase their amazing skillz against the AI player because someone decided to quit just before the game started, dribbling behind double screens and greening everything 

b) they don't get matched against the aforementioned cheating, amazing players :). 

It's the promise of the IFs that probably makes us play this game daily or maybe the fact that there's no other basketball game available.

If you plan on playing offline, you may have a more enjoyable experience. I played MyCareer pretty extensively this year and it is better than previous years, IF you exclude the million cutscenes before each match starts, the Gatorade ad that runs at each timeout, the syncing issues if you have a monitor with +60hz, the fact that you HAVE to watch the ending of each quarter  when you're on the bench and plenty other annoyances. 

The player builder is pretty good this year and I've had fun (initially) leveling up two different builds in offline MyCareer but it does get pretty grindy after a while. 

All in all, if you have the patience of a Tibetan monk, you may have fun."
11664,Its alright for pc but i would get it on console if you have one otherwise good gameplay for nba enthusiasts and accurate players and good mycareer experince
11665,VERY NICE
11666,"Absolutely beautiful mess of a game, bugs everywhere, and p2w is strong with this one."
11667,There are still some dumbass cheaters buts its better than last year anyway.
11668,goos shit
11669,The game itself is good but it needs better care from the 2K devs
11670,šišši
11671,Good game
11672,lag and stupid
11673,damn nasty
11674,no one to compete with
11675,"its a fun game with bad devs, do not buy unless you love basketball"
11676,excellent
11677,2k continues to get worse every year.  This will be the last year I purchase the game.  They have done nothing to improve the graphics or the gameplay.  The game looks even worse and plays much worse than previous 2k games.  Kind of sad seeing all these games come out and have outstanding graphics and gameplay but 2k is just much behind the curve...
11678,I mean there's so much grinding but its decent.
11679,"Due to the reviews, I wasn't expected much. But I gotta admit, I have played this game (mostly MyCareer) a lot and enjoyed it more it than I expected. Despite that, there are some glaring issues that need to be fixed.

These are just some I can come up of the top of my head:
- Whenever you set the refresh rate above 60Hz (for example 144Hz, or in my case, 240Hz), it causes a game-breaking bug where, in MyCareer, you cannot skip part of the gameplay (simulate the game until next appearance) when you get subbed out. You have to basically have to sit and watch your A.I teammates play for 5-6 minutes every game. There are some workarounds, set the refresh rate back to 60Hz (which kinda suck cause I bought this game to pay in high refresh rate) or ALT-TAB several times until you can sub in.

- This game constantly crashes on my PC. I tried everything, re-installing the GPU driver, re-installing game, checked for missing game files, change in-game setting, updating windows, nothing works. My PC Spec is far above the recommended requirements (3900x + 2080ti).

- The game is basically the same as 2k19, same engine, same graphics, just a little upgrade on the User Interfaces.

- You can basically pay-to-win on this game. It is filled to the brim with micro-transactions.

- You cannot access MyPlayerNation, 2KLeague and Ruffles rewards on PC Versions (Unlike the ones on consoles)

In conclusion,
NBA2K19 V2 is not worth 80 CAD. Don't buy it (unless it's at least 95% off). You can get a lot of burritos for $80"
11680,"This game is a joke, do not get this. Full of bugs, wont even run properly on a RTX 2060. Steam should be ashamed to have this game available for purchase."
11681,Way too many cheaters
11682,its ightt
11683,"just bad as f, there are so many bugs, details couldn't be worse."
11684,a
11685,the defence get harder lol
11686,"Its pretty fun. With my experience so far i enjoyed most all my career and most of my team some glitches from here and there but otherwise it seems pretty fun,"
11687,"As a 2K Player who has been playing serious since 2K14 I am extremely disappointed on how far 2K has exaggerated how bad they can do. The game was on the rise through 14-17 and surpassed live throughout those years. Honestly I wished we could get older servers at least for PC only, or if 2K allowed us to host our own servers just like some other games. I've always been a Iso player, and I will always rely on it until 2K removes dribbling entirely, the fact that the META to Iso is Pro 3 behind the back and Hesitation is sad, we all have to use the same signature styles, and it truly disappoints me.

As a long time consumer I dislike this game, although it's the only game I can play because anything else is boring. However I like that cheaters are always going to be there but at least there's not many this year. Not only that but I also like the new Archetype system and the Badges system. However even if there is a bad 2K I will always be comp, never had below a 70 win percentage. So what can i say, you will not like this game if you are a previous 2K consumer and you will like this game if this is your first 2K."
11688,"not good
"
11689,this game is absolutley amazing i mean people always say its bad but thats only because they cant win against other players or all star npcs the game is absolutely incredible with badges and upgrading system with multiple modes i cant believe the people who say its bad

I see 7'3 post scoring centers who play like 6'5 playmakers. Ronnie, please, i am begging you with a burning passion, please make an effort to ban hackers on the here gaming platform."
11694,"The gameplay is great, but the hackers ruin the gaming experience. Not one game in the park do I not encounter a hacker thats 7'3 with speedboost hacks and dribble moves. 2K please ban the hackers and fix the game."
11695,this game is so dope! its boring while the start of this game but when you passed it its really fun for me.
11696,i just bought some vc after purchasing this game and it's not showing up at all!!!
11697,This game is idiotic and the developers as well... i got banned literally without a reason when theres so much cheaters getting away with it... i cant beleive it man i have never been banned and i have played from 2k16 never used cheats and i was hyped about this game too and just like that even though you didnt do anything you get banned THATS HOW DUMB DEVELOPERS ARE SO PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME AT LEAST ON PC

11700,"There are some issues on my Career Mode that pisses me off.
First its not keyboard friendly.
Second is on a 7minute per quarter game. when im simulating the game cause im on the bench. I dont know how the players playing on the court can score so much. it reaches 100+ points even though its just a 7mins per quarter game.
Third is that i am looking at the other games score. There is no option to change the minutes per quarter on other simulated games. and it looks to me while im playing a 7m/Q the other games on the league is playing 12min/Q game cause superstars from other team avgs 30+ PPG
Fourt is the camera angle i like to use is Broadcast during my game. cause i get dizzy on the default camera. But everytime i got bench or start a new game the camera always return back to default, Is there no way to make the camera angle i like permanent?"

I haven't bought any 2K game ever since 2k17, which was a pure trash.
I bought this one because I was super bored and it was half price.

11745,"I have been playing NBA2k for many years.  I learned early on that this game is always released with a lot of glitches and problems.  These issue always get ironed out, eventually, so the last few years I wait and get it after a few months.  Saves a lot of frustration and I can enjoy the game as it should be.  I bought this game during the Black Friday sale, and it was well worth it.  

I play mainly MyCareer mode, and a little of the MyTeam stuff.  I havn't had any issues as of this review and I am 60 hours in.  It's the best story line so far, or at least in a long time.  This is my first time playing it on PC and I must say I do not think I will go back to XBox for 2k.  Game runs really smooth, the player builds are fun and I just feel like this is a great game.  I would highly recommend it for those that enjoy building a player, or a Dynastic franchise.  As far a multiplayer online goes, I cannot comment."

11752,It's really fun
11753,very smooth and amazing career mode and park
11754,"Honest review. The My team story seems less than last year. However the build a player is much better., The game is much better. seems like less hackers. Also less MTS is required. You can earn them a lot easier. Just look at all the hours all the negative reviews have and you will know the truth. The game is fun and well made."
11755,Best game ever
11756,"despite bad reviews, there are a lot of improvements from last year in regards to MyCareer. yes alot is copied, but so much has been improved. The prologue is far less cringy and much more fun to play than last year, the player creation is also brilliant, so much better than last year it just makes so much more sense to do it this way, gives the creator far more control. dribbling feels so much better and upgrading badges makes a huge difference to how your player feels. in 40 ish hours ive managed to go from scratch to 78 rated currently (37 hours) with quarters on 6 minutes and recently upped to 7 so i can manage double doubles for incentives. playing a 6'5 shooting guard two way sharpshooter. vc is easily earned compared to last years what felt like a horrible grind, only me? idk.
Music is trash lmao when is it not with 2k recently. couple good ones okay ill give them that. 90% trash.
plenty of drills to chose from, also get 2x bonuses often and sometimes a legend comes along and grants u a 3x which is suuuuper helpful for leveling up those badges.
as long as you chose the right badges to fit your player, you will be a beast at even 80 rated providing you play well. but i cant stress how important badges are!! GET THE BADGES OR U WILL REGRET IT I PROMISE. just google best 2k20 badges a reddit post will appear, thats the golden one. 
dont understand this unskippable ad thing, i think its gone now? i dont see that anywhere anymore...
the game is fine, it runs better than 2k19.

multiplayer from the UK. finally playable. last year was absolute aids. latency was insane. this year i can actually play online! 

get on sale for 25 maximum. never more.

NEVER BUY VC YO BOYCOTT THAT SH!T

11757,still sucks ass lmao
11758,"If you quit, or get dced 2 games in the same day (DOESN'T MATTER WHEN), you get a 15 minute suspension. Like anyone wants to finish a game against hackers anyway. Get the game when it's worth $2.99 cause thats how much this piece of s*** is really worth"
11759,"I just think 2k can do better than a money laundering experience. I wish all the best for them and the devs to make this game great again, instead of making it all about VC. Best of luck guys, I know you can make a great game for the people. I just hope the greed hasn't completely taken over."

11772,good game
11773,"I enjoy the game as much as i hate it, the gameplay is awesome but all the bugs, crashes, even in My Career, there is a lot of unfixed things yet. Devs does not care at all, too busy with useless patch about micro-transaction stuffs. If you like to spend in real life money for content you use to have for free, then its your game. I don't recommend it. 5/10

EDIT: 4 months later, it is worst than ever, on every 3 game i play in my career, I'm crashing, late in the third or fourth quarter,( you wonder why the game does not save itself after each quarter)
2020 FELLAS THIS IS PEAK TECHNOLOGY.  Dont buy this game, it will consume you. NEW NOTE: 4/10

EDIT 2: Crash after crash, In The Rec, on the court, and obviously in your MyCareer game with a few seconds left, meaning grinding those 48minutes games totally useless, and yes it crashes A LOT. AGAIN DONT BUY THIS GAME TILL THEY DO SOMETHING ABOUT PC VERSION BUT THEY WONT. 0/10"
11774,its fun
11775,The bad reviews you'll find only scratch the surface of how lazily scrapped together this sorry excuse of a 60 dollar game is. Don't buy this game if you can help it. It is one of the worst games of the year and one of the worst games released by a AAA studio this decade.
11776,Just a bad game.
11777,"I came from 2K16 to 2K20 and i thought it would be better. This game is complete trash, it's way too clunky and the mechanics are horrid."
11778,"As a huge NBA and basketball fan, this is one of my go to games. Unfortunately, the game is riddled with so many issues that it feels like Ronnie2k himself is playing god with my copy of the game. 

I can almost hear him cackling as I get booted from my 4th MyPark game in a row"

11780,not as bad as people make it out to be
11781,"Same game like last year, not much changed"
11782,actual fucking garbage
11783,"Still the best basketball video game there is out there, no matter how much we may complain about the microtransactions. I play MyCareer more than anything, and I love how they keep adding stuff to customize your MyPlayer more, and I hope they continue down that adding in customizing road for next year's game. Though MyLeague does need some work, I'm in hopes they do the best they can to make it feasible, and get it working much more nicely by the time the PS5 comes out, since PlayStation is pretty much their biggest platform."

11791,"Very good game from the offline POV, MyCareer is cool and fun to do and the builder is nicely done, MyTeam you can do Domination (3 separate levels from Current NBA to Historic Teams and later to All-time teams, along the way you keep receiving rewards and stuff you can either purchase on the auction house or just open packs with MTPoints or VC), triple threat is also cool, you have rewards for up to 1000 wins (Galaxy Opal Dominique Wilkins). The MyGM is also cool to play and very rewarding if you do it correctly and actually know what you're doing.

From the Online POV the game for me is pretty much a 2/10 and I don't give it a 0 because sometimes you find a good enough server to play on and it's pretty cool to play online. Most of the times you get matched up against 10+ levels of overall rankings with a laggy server against a dude that literally has almost a team full of galaxy opals (TOP Level players basically, above 99). 

I'm from Portugal, I played CSGO, Squad, R6S and any other MP games and never had a laggy server to play on and on NBA 2K20 looks like only 1 out of 7-8 games you play with a decent server ping wise and against an equal or almost equal team on the other side. I mean if you're into spending money on the microeconomy stuff and GAMBLE if you can win or not because of the garbage servers, be my guest but as for me I won't play more MP since it's just pointless.

Offline gameplay --> 7,5/10
Online gameplay --> 2/10

So if you enjoy offline and don't really care about online stuff buy it, otherwise don't bother."

11815,always crashes always has a problem shit game online. disaster of a game
11816,"I have never in my life been more frustrated with technical issues than with NBA 2K20. The only reason I play it is because there is no other current NBA game to play. I would say roughly 50% of the time I load the game, it crashes before I ever get into an actual game of any sort. This makes grinding the game miserable. These crashes are unlike any I have seen before too, because, at least for me, when the game crashes, it doesn't fully close out. So, I can't re open the game until I force shutdown my computer, because the Windows 10 shutdown won't even work. The once great, and still best part of 2K is MyCareer, and it is now also the most poorly optimized part. The one thing I actually want to play in the game is the part that crashes the most often and suffers the most technical problems. Not to mention, the security must be horrible, because I would be suprised if there wasn't more than a couple hackers in every neighborhood online. I'm not even going to talk about the gameplay, because it is just meh, nothing more, nothing less."

11841,let down of a game honestly should be free for everyone to experience this garbage.
11842,"This game Is trash....I buy this game every year in hopes it gets better. Some how they keep getting worse. I think the offline modes Lag more than the online modes do. They change the myGM and its just garbage. I usually play that mode because it was fun for me. Now I just get frustrated. I played a full game and wasn't allowed to substitute anybody and the coach was not auto subbing. Very frustrating....
Not a good year for 2k....WWE was crap and so is NBA. The team of developers that makes MLB the Show should make an NBA game and show 2k how to do make a good sports game."
11843,r
11844,"its a very fun game to play but still could use some work. The big men need some changes on how they do the pick and roll but I like the new way of shooting and love that you can play with friends.

After playing this game longer I just get more and more frustrated. I tried to look for more information on the dunk contest such as who was going to be in it. Little did I know that it was going to start simulating through games. It simulated three games before I could stop it. I scored 30 less points in each game than I would have. We lost one of them and we were on a 10 game win streak. My points per game went down. I didn't win player of the week. The more I play this game the more I get frustrated at it. Currently at 150+ hours in the game"

11863,This game is terrible. Forget the greedy micro transactions that has infected every part of this game worse than a stage four cancer. The game crashes every time I attempt to play it. At some point in the 3rd quarter the game will hard crash back to the desktop without an error code. THIS HAPPENS IN EVERY GAME MODE. I reached out to 2k for a solution. They told me to check my internet connection and that was it. I am currently in the process of requesting a refund due to the game being unplayable. Don't make the purchase unless it has a 90% discount and even then it probably won't even be worth the headache.

11877,Game is not bad but servers are very laggy so you can't play it normaly
11878,Ok. I gave this game a chance despite the overwhelming negative reviews it has. I have played a total of 45 hours of play time and the game just keeps crashing on me. I play MyCareer and already in my 34th game as a rookie. I have tried upgrading Windows and the game by going to the main menu and it still keeps crashing. I just wish there is a way to refund. It's just a very frustrating game to play with. Not enough players on Neighborhood. Just DO NOT BUY THIS GAME at all! Stay away from this! It's just a copy-paste game of nba 2k19 with updated rosters. Not worth buying even if it's on sale!
11879,"In simple word: THIS IS THE BEST NBA GAMES EVER.

I know many people won't agree. But, here's my point:
1. I'm NOT PLAYING ONLINE. I enjoy every mechanism of the game. It's so much realistic in offense and defense compared to 2K19. Love the flexibility on new dribble mechanism even though it's much harder for me...
2. The AI much more natural when reacted to our move, more human like. Even 1 on 1 battle feels so much fun in 2K20.

Note: I'm not trying online not because there's so much cheater, or there's so much grinding. But, it's pointless for me. If I want to play my own player, I will just create a player, then play with it. AND the TOP reason that I'm not playing online is: I'm from Indonesia. I use very fast internet connection, and good ping. But still, the server of NBA lagging for my country ( I think ).

SO, IS THE GAME WORTH THE PRICE?
Sorry for most of people that disappointed in this game, but I think it is really worth the price. Just think about the gameplay alone, it's worth it. :)

It's not that I'm not agreeing with all of you that's not satisfied with 2K response to the community, but at least I know the price is right, even though they still need to improve their response and service.

That's all :D."

I've purchased every 2K since Dreamcast and since the VC started, I've yet to purchase 1 penny of it.

I earn my Player VC by playing the game. Simple as that!

Game crashes A LOT, they want you to spend money to bypass actually working to get good in the game, online is laggy and abused by players that are used to playing on the awful ping provided by their terrible servers. The ai is terrible no matter the difficulty you put them on, especially your teammates the harder to difficulty you choose. The game is terrible and won't get better since 2k has a monopoly on this. SPEND YOUR MONEY ON SOMETHING BETTER, it is not worth it and most importantly, definitely not your time."
11897,great game
11898,"Over 200 hours and still hooked just like the first day. I am not playing online modes (nor paid any microtransaction), and so far I am having having a blast playing matches and improving my team.

The game is far from perfect though, and my biggest complains are about the ever present microtransactions, the ads in the game and the randomization of prizes. 

However, under all that trash, there is an incredible and amazing basketball game. One I simply can't stop playing."

You cannot sim to next appearance for MyCareer if you have anything higher than 60hz settings. You need only 60hz with VSync on. This is such a let down. With 60hz, the game is so much smoother to play on consoles (PS4 Pro, Xbox One X). Don't waste your money on this and go buy a console if you want to play it."
11944,"Running this game on a brand new rig with an RTX 2070, it constantly stutters and runs like trash.   Between not working with drivers and constant crashes I would say this is the worst 2k to date.  Played every 2k since 2k10 and I think this will be my last."
11945,i think this game is good lol
11946, still ass
11947,Bought it on sale. and now I am on 38 hours lol. Skeptical at first about buying it cause of the reviews. but this is my first 2k game in a few years so its cool for me.
11948,gg
11949,Pretty much a copy of last year but still a good game I wish they added more to my leauge/gm such going to resturats or reviewing film with players or going on vacations with players. And add more to my carrer
11950,"This game is so frustrating. Downloaded 80GB hell of a game and waited for so many hours to finish it, and it will just give you disappointment. Settings all in HIGH mode and yet still pixelated and I don't know why. I bought this game on a 50% off sale and ignored all of those negative comments, and yet all of those comments were true. Don't waste your money for this game.  I was really excited to play this game with the new PHX Suns roster. SMH"
11951,"I don't care about the microtransactions anymore, I mean if people are stupid enough to spend real-life hard earned money on overpriced in-game currency worth nothing(it's not like I haven't spent atleast 100+£ on VC in past 3 years) why would they change it when it makes probably twice the money as the game alone? It's not their fault, it's our fault.

Let me get to the gameplay, I LOVE IT! Besides AI being stupid, such as randon switches or switches on pick n rolls or standing in the paint when there is a guy open it the corner on fastbreak or AI unable to turn around while opponent is sprinting on fastbreak, gameplay is pretty damn good. I only played MyCarrer, finally after all the years you can use menu to navigate the game not the pointless and time wasting walking in the neighborhood. Feel like game is pretty smooth very enjoyable for me, love the new creation of the player, people say it is the same as archtypes but its not, you can leave out pointless abilities you dont need(e.g. my PF doesnt need ballhandling or steals) and you can max out other atributes, you still cannot create a Lebron, Giannis or Luka but you can get closer to your dream build this year.

I don't expect anything from the servers as PC has the lowest playerbase compared to consoles(atleast I think, some1 fact check that) so makes sense they dont't give much attention to the PC servers. I played one park game and it seemed alright much better than 2K19 experience but hard to judge from one game.

All in all I feel I haven't enjoyed a 2K game this much since 2K17, hope it stays this way. IF YOU LIKE GAME OF BASKETBALL - MUST HAVE TITLE.

NEVER. STOP. BALLIN.

EDIT: after few more hours and leveling up myplayer I must say the game is good. Not perfect but good enough for me, after last few years of playing this game on PC and servers crashing all the time and park games disconecting, its much better. There is still input lag so if you expect perfect game its not for you. Also the problems I had with AI was just me not realizing I didn't change the difficulty from Pro to HOF, the switching and defending was not that bad after the change but I was wondering how im droping 50-20-10 on HOF with my 80ovr player."
11952,nice
11953,"gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
"
11954,"My main issues with the game are some of the camera settings cant be used in quick play online, you have to have friends in order to play a lot of the online features rather than finding people who are already playing, the queue times for online play as well are pretty long so its kinda of time consuming. I do not play my player but its the same with my team its hard to find people for that feature as well. So, i suggest if you want it waiting until the price drops some more before considering buying it"
11955,"If you're only looking for a great MyCareer experience, you will find it here. This is probably one of the best MyCareer's yet. I would recommend if you only plan to play this part of the game just about everything else is trash."
11956,NICE GAME
11957,"I kinda like it. theres some shitty greedy choices by 2k - micro transactions everywhere etc. Some items and visuals in mycareer locked behind forced online play (which I hate personally) - that being said I got 138 hours in the game as of this ""review"" and ill hit 200 before I stop easy. so for that amount of play time its a decent buy."
11958,"nice game but multiplayer need to improve pls ,play with my friends still lagging ,poor server"
11959,good
11960,KEEPS CRASHING RANDOMLY THIS GAME IS TRASH 2K19 IS A MASTERPIECE JESUS CHRIST
11961,It is fun
11962,n
11963,Fun
11964,"my name is trey i got a basket game tommorow
"
11965,"The game fucking crashes when I am about to be subbed
Edited:
Now it fucking crashes for no reason whenever I want to play the specific my player account"
11966,awful.
11967,The game is awesome
11968,Better than 2k19 for sure
11969,Garbage ass game. TRASH
11970,sbwy 2K nmsl
11971,Don't buy this rip-off of a game.
11972,"Copy and paste. Year after year most of the game is a direct copy of last year. Want to play MyLeague ""start today"" mode? Well, it's broken much of the time each year and at the moment of typing this, it's down. Only reason this game sells is because of the monopoly the company has over NBA gaming. It's just a sad situation and doesn't have any glimmer of hope that it will ever change."
11973,This is a game any fun guy would like to play
11974,"STUPID GAME A LOT OF BUG, SAME OLD SHIT, RONNIE2K CAN GO FUCK HIMSELF STUPID IDIOT"
11975,"How does 2k Devs allow Modifications to their software.  I see so many people modding its not even funny, you're charging 59.99 + tax for this game. I can't even enjoy the game  with out seeing some center who moves like a point guard etc etc. I will no longer purchase this game on PC just a waste of time and money.  You got people with no skills modding the game ruining the fun of others. I'm upset because PC 2k Graphics look so much better but other than that straight trash. I cant enjoy this game anymore thanks to the Devs who care less about the PC version and the people modding . I mean if you want to allow modding then at least Highlight the players(Modding) so people know they are modding or make a Mods Tab.  if you want to mod go in the Mods section. If you want to play with straight skills go to the My Career  tab .  I would prefer you stop all modification to your software or ban those that have modified the folder in any way.  Someone needs to step up and fix this.  PC gaming is much better than Xbox or Playstation IMO."
11976,straight ass they aint addin shi. Everything costs money
11977,I like that you have easy controls and the graphics are superb
11978,The game sucks and there's too many microtransactions.
11979,"Worst piece of shit broken game ever! The developers are just money hungry cunts that don't care about their game as long as they r getting money! They will never fix the gameplay exploits and glitches but as soon as a vc glitch comes out it is patched in a hour! Don't buy even if it is on sale for $10, don't waste ur time!!!"
11980,"not even 2k19 remastered, just new dribble moves and ads"
11981,this game is shit
11982,"great career mode but anything online based is just laggy , latency is terrible.
moves are delayed .
And I have good internet ethernet still the latency on here is trash"

11984,Glitchli bir oyun daha teşekkürler 2K
11985,very good game
11986,Excellent Game
11987,You basically have to pay to upgrade your MyPlayer. 2K is trash!
11988,"Awesome
"
11989,IS GOOD
11990,:)
11991,Crashes way too much for a AAA game. 32 additional hours since my initial review and this game still randomly crashes. This game is literally broken they don't even care trying to fix it.
11992,.
11993,"If you plan to play offline, it's awesome, but with online, expect park/neighborhood full off cheaters. Devs don't care about security, I hope it will improve soon."
11994,goood
11995,"You know this game, VC play the big rules unless you want to grind all the time"
11996,SOOOOOOOO Many hackers still. Crazy how this game gets worse and worse each year.
11997,My career is great to grind and i like this game a lot!
11998,"i like sports

"
11999,this game is terrible! i dont even play online with other people i just do myGM and my Career. it glitches the game modes are nothing like they used to be... im going back to 2k19

12005,bad
12006,It's ok
12007,"Same story every year, awful, disgusting, unrealistic, making you want to smash your gamepad because there is no sense to play My Career unless you spend some money on VC. Last money 2k will get from me, thank God I did not pay the full price. F*** NBA 2K"
12008,"Yeah, epic"

12016,i like this
12017,SO GOOD GAME
12018,"its ok
"
12019,"Maybe it's just because I haven't played any of the other NBA games before, but I found this game incredibly frustrating. The controls aren't intuitive and they tried to add so much complexity to it that I found it detracted from the overall gameplay. Also, to some extent, you have to make the game realistic and take the player out of the game, but if I'm testing my build, I should stay in the entire game. Testing the build is just about trying things, and it doesn't help to be simulating half the game and not playing in it. I also think the practice drills could seriously be improved on. I should be learning things I can actually use in real games, and not random skills that aren't really applicable. Overall, 2/5 stars. Sad I spent $30 on this game probably never to play it again."
12020,very cool
12021,MyCareer is an upgrade from last year
12022,我是傻逼
12023,Only franchise it's okay
12024,MYPLAYER ONLY!!!!
12025,RIP KOBE
12026,"I only play MyTeam and don't buy anything, just play AH and earn MY points for upgrade cards. This game has awful optimization i have an amazing PC. and i keep getting FPS drops that stutter my game play most annoying thing ever.


*UPDATED* i only play MyTeam and for that the game has been great. they or something randomly fixed my FPS issue i was having. so i take that back."
12027,very good
12028,Park on PC is kinda dead but  the MyCareer mode is very good
12029,"I think this game needs a lot of improvements, but overall it's fun."
12030,The worst NBA i've ever purchased. Would highly not recommend.
12031,h
12032,"As vezes fecha sozinho e da um erro de conexão que eu não acho no site da 2k. Além disso o jogo é muito bom, e bem divertido."
12033,very good
12034,"good
"
12035,"AWFUL servers, many bugs, pay-to-win. Like the main developer himself said, this game is PURE DOG SH*T."
12036,It's fun and it's easier to get vc unlike 2k19 you can get more vc. The best part about it is that the rep system is just like 2k17's system and its much faster to earn it. The badge's is another great part to since you are able to place the points on your own badge and make it HOF if that your main skill. The only problem is FIX YOUR DANG SERVERS 2K FROM LAGGY TO SMOOTH.The End
12037,goooooouuud

12047,rubbish server like window XP on 2019
12048,nice gameplay
12049,fun game to play
12050,"Essentially the same as last year's version, but with some small tweaks and changes, which is exactly what I expected."
12051,I don't care for most of the complaints about this game. I mainly play the career mode (not online) and the play now function with friends and it's fine. Loading screens haven't been an issue but I have the game on my SSD so that may differ from others. All around good basketball game IMO.
12052,"Same game, again and again..."
12053,great game
12054,its fun
12055,its good
12056,"Terrible server. keep getting disconnected every few games.

Strategies on defending screens are terrible too, making tons of mistakes and mismatches.

Some training tasks are not even doable at all with keyboard.

Only good thing is the MC story.

edit: my ""purchase failed"" problem was caused by our university (ISU, you may guess which ISU) that blocked connection from the game to nba2k.com.
bypassing the block (like using a phone as hot spot) solved the problem in no time.

If you're encountering the same problem make sure to check your connection to server first - maybe the problem was caused by your ISP."
12057,amazing game love it
12058,good game
12059,don't throw away money down the toilet
12060,Really cool gameplay!

12071,"IM A HUGE FAN OF BASKETBALL.... GRAPHICS, GAMEPLAY PERFECT! 10/10 on that aspect... the REAL MOTHAFUCKING ISSUE IS THE CONNECTION, EVERYTIME I PLAY WITH ANOTHER PERSON ONLINE IM FUCKING LAG!...

SO I BOUGHT THIS GAME TO PLAY SINGLE PLAYER... 

honestly if I CAN HAVE MY MONEY BACK WILL BE GREAT!"
12072,This is dookie

12077,"Awesome game
"
12078,"trash game
waste of money"
12079,"New system and mechanics, same problems.  The game is fine if you play it for the single player experience but if you want to go online against other players you are better off playing this title on console."
12080,bdfbxfb
12081,"As always, trash servers!!! same goes on all consoles."
12082,Pretty good game no lagging no nothing players little too cheap but alright
12083,I LOVE THIS GAME
12084,Game is still fun.
12085,really good
12086,I love this game the only problem is 2k getting a lot of money from it and it appears that they just updating the roster of it.
12087,"One of the best game, maybe the best I played this year !"
12088,its aight
12089,"I dont play this game online, however I do play it a lot offline my career being my favorite game mode and this is the best one in a long time."

12094,hi
12095,"Honestly it sucks when it comes to microtransactions. But probably I will buy 2K21 as I do every year.
PLUS Fucking career mode cutscenes are bugged as hell it's almost impossible to get through it."
12096,Best Game!!
12097,bad
12098,Not that bad of a game could be worse. Servers aren't the greatest.
12099,Good game for whose really like basketball
12100,"Its fun to play on Singleplayer mode. But in park... they bringing some events, stuffs to buy and etc. its ok, but cmon... Servers are laggy, a lot of bugs, errors, why you cant repair it first before adding some stuffs in game #2K ??? If you Alt + Tab the game, you get error a lot of times, also after  the game you can get ""Reconnect your controler"" message or just simply the game will shut down, or you will get error, if you in squad, you have to quickly mute your squadmates or the game will crash  (Facepalm) It looks like the developers dont care about the players, they do not support the game and didnt try to fix it. Sad..."
12101,2K Baby!
12102,gay m8
12103,nice
12104,isaac bonga should be a galaxy opal
12105,For me is  Cool !!!!

12107,Sick game bro
12108,Probably fine I don't play that casino thing though........
12109,"Game is decent, but honestly, PC  servers are trash, if you have just a bit weaker internet chances are you probably won't be able to play park normally. For now, My Career is my go to mode, but not many improvements compared to 2k19. 2k19 offline career felt more interesting with those interactions. Recommend playing it, but for everybody else, don't buy it for PC. It's a lot better on PS4."
12110,"everything i stimulates the game goes slow motion and i dont know why did u called it stimulate the game when u make it slower???? and and sometimes i waited so long and the game will crush or ill play with slow motion what is this 2k pls fix this,,, 2k19 is way better than 2k20 this game have a lot of issues"
12111,Shit A.I. mechanics.......   You need to be always serious in playing this stupid game.
12112,"still the best nba sim game. other than that, not much improvements"
12113,"the best NBA 2K game so far when on the court, with strong career mode. The new physical mode, the impact of the new defensive system and the fine tuning of the gameplay is something valuable whih give to basketball lovers endless possibilities."
12114,cool
12115,the best
12116,"great game, hackers need to be fixed tho"
12117,"Don't need the cutscenes.  Timeout is called just go straight to the be the coach. Skip the players fist bumping. Skip the hype team passing out T shirts. Why are you even spending developer time and resources making these things? When a foul happens, just cut to the player WITH THE BALL. Don't need Tony Brothers making himself a part of this game by holding the ball before passing to the player. Or the ref giving it to the player before the inbound. I turned off cutscenes between baskets and and whatnot to never and I still get cinematics. I don't care who is player of the game. I don't care about assist of the game. I don't need to see highlights of the game I am currently playing. I turned off the crowd and media and still I got to have a halftime show with Shaq and Kenny? Let me play the fkn game. Stop making me have to mash A B to skip through all this. Spend your monies making it so my players catch a steal when the ball hits them IN THEIR FACE."
12118,"shit
"
12119,"If you are a singleplayer MyCareer mode player dont be turned off by the reviews. This is the best MyCareer mode ive played in years. 2K have listened to the community and produced a enjoyable experience similar to that of NBA2K14's my career mode.

if you dont care about online multiplayer but want a solid Singleplayer MyCareer mode experience, you cant go wrong with this."
12120,"I dont understand y ppl complain about the game and the ads so much, the game is fine and the ads are barely even disturbing, just shut up and play the game that you've paid for and if you dont enjoy it, why did you even but it in the first place... Whatevs man, this game is very good overall."

12123,Aight so at the beginning really didnt enjoy this game because i was not aware of how large of an impact badges had on it. Now that i further understand the game and have put a good amount of hours on it i can say that it is a shit but playing w friends is lit!
12124,Good for single player and mycareer but online is trash
12125,Love nba 2k
12126,"waste of money
"
12127,"the park is always dead, dont buy this if you want to do that"
12128,"I already owned the mobile version on android, but this is not even in the same spectrum of how amazingly realistic the game play is. The weight of the player is so much realer than i was expecting. What i mean by that is when you move you better be dedicated to going the way you start because there is no changing halfway through your stride like older games. No game comes close to the realness of the ball handling and the games gravity is so life like, it took me 5 hours to really figure out how to correctly dedicate myself to shooting as well as even going up to block a shot. THUMBS UP 2K ! Great job on this game it really is a close simulation to real life. THIS IS THE GRAN TURISMO of NBA 2k20!!!!!!!!!!!!"
12129,nice!
12130,"Good game 
Full of Ads"

12133,cool fun
12134,xzfrhymdz
12135,good overall. Just don't like the loot system. 7.5/10
12136,"Nice game play and could easily be played with friends for whole year.... exept 2k shits on PC version and allows cheating. 2k prob want all to play with ps. It's a shame... 2k gives out inteviews like ""I don't know what anti cheat mechanism is"". Waste of money if you wanna play multiplayer game with pc. Most of the gamers it's a no no buy. I'v played for a long time and every year it get worse. Prob you can u same cheats with 2k18, 2k19 and 20, thats why the long arm losers are there from the day 1."
12137,game server build with stoneage technology  very impressive
12138,gotta be real this game is plagued by the worst AI i have ever seen in a sports game and i SWEAR there are bots on the auction house but in the interest of honesty im gonna keep playing it all year
12139,Love it
12140,"First of all any game you can easily put over a 100 hours into a game well deserves your money and a positive review. Is it better than last years game 2k19?? Debatable but it has its pros and cons. It seems like they downsized shooting so much in this game as well as other features. On the bright side it is a bit more realistic, but the movements seem choppier than last years. Also there are certain bugs that annoy me like the jumpshots dont save right and a lot of park animations never work. Although the badge system is wonderful and makes up for a lot of the cons. The woman league is dope as hell, and ive always wanted something like that. Lets hope for a better 2k next year, as of  now, 2k is still the best and addicting game on the planet!! LOL"
12141,amazing game
12142,lets go 300 hour now
12143,"i cant get into my cereer
"
12144,Worst in the series by far. Uninstalled after playing only a few hours.
12145,really trash

12149,VERY good
12150,its good
12151,"Guud geim, gud grafiks"
12152,Probably best 2k game out there
12153,ok
12154,lies
12155,"Ok let's go with the following:

1. The people giving this game bad reviews are the same ones giving this game bad reviews since 2014, people who can't play the game, and complain about microtransactions that you actually don't need since the game gives you plenty of oportunity to earn VC just by playing. 

2. while the online has hiccups most of the bad reviews are salty Btches who jack up shots online with KOBEEEEE and can't win a game because they don't know the fundamentals of team basketball. 

3. this game has the most fluid and best basketball game play around but it my be too real for those little kids ( the ones putting the bad reviews )  since it's not NBA JAM or some un realistic game like that. 

4. This game is full of stuff to do , My career, My Team, GM ect if you look closely at the people who complain like little Btchs you'll see some of them have 100 to 600 hours of game play..... think about that for a minute most games dont even give you 20 to 30 and this one gives you 100+ and people complain, MILLENIALS gotto love em. 

THIS is a real good game fuild gameplay, a DS4 runs amazing but I also even use the steam controller, also noticie how people who wrote bad reviews disable their comments like little btches."
12156,it is all about to get on the right feel
12157,"This game is fire, gets better every year!"
12158,"yeah its fun. Same old game but at least you know what youre buying
"
12159,actual booty cheeks :(
12160,.
12161,a
12162,As of today the game costs about 3 dollars. Which is only 2 dollars more than it's worth.
12163,"I've been playing 2k since 2k11 every year i bought this game to this date. But honestly every year there has been a decline in the quality of these games since 2k15 and this one is mostly unplayable cause it crashes constantly, microtransactions etc. 2k20 imo is actually an okay game without the crashes. I play my team and i am sometimes tempted to buy vc to get cards but they have actually made it not horrible this year. Just fix the fucking crashing"
12164,"FUCKING crap unless you have a gay xbox controller the game is useless. cant even exit unless you CTRL ALT DEL and close it down....
If we wanted to play with a controller we would have bought it for the ebox or ps4
wish I never bought it

12169,"10 hours of this game, most of time is wasted on connecting the NBA2k servers... Just succeeded once
Is there anyone can help with the annoying error 4B538E50?
I've submitted a request to support.2k.com, but no one replied to me..."
12170,this game is fuin
12171,I like it
12172,not as bad as people say it is tbh
12173,fun for me...i dont even watch basketball
12174,best game ever
12175,solid game.
12176,Broken af gameplay. otherwise fun
12177,Nice
12178,"great game
"
12179,Note: This applies only to mycarrer the only game mode i care about. Well i have not been really buying nba 2k games for awhile inless they were really discounted. Mostly because of the greed and then on top of that the insane amount of time it took to get to each game with everything else you had to before games to get your stats up. This year the greed and your starting averages are still terrible. But you can skip cutscenes and the story is short to get you right into games. There is practice before games but it just helps you get your stats up and learn more about your myplayer.
12180,Good game but No one plays Cage or Ante Up
12181,"Compared to older NBA's, this is trash. All the players are unrealistically slow.. No shots go down.. cant score in the post. Its laughable at this point how this game was once the best backk in the 2k16 days, and now its utter trash."
12182,sucks
12183,Nice Game!
12184,"Not better than last years game. Skill and badge system makes no sense. you can get all 3 pt badges without scoring, or even without trying a single 3 pt in a match or practice. and you can change the badges any time. imagine how ridiculous it sounds for mycareer players."
12185,this game is broken -mahk
12186,s
12187,Worst Copy/Paste NBA this century. I still have hope for 2k to make this game better and care more about community.
12188,"good shit
"
12189,just sucks
12190,"This game is awful.  If you just want to play My Career don't even bother.  Your player starts so bad that it is almost impossible to do anything in games.  This game is designed to get you to spend real money to make your player better, or just have absolutely no fun for dozens of hours until you can grind enough to be somewhat competent.  It has been this way for many years, but I feel that it is the worst it has ever been this year.  I'm done giving this game a chance.  This is the last NBA 2K game I will ever buy unless they drastically reduce how much they exploit you into spending more money."
12191,fuckin trash but this is the only choice
12192,Have you enjoyed NBA 2K in the past? Then this is the game for you.
12193,我是傻逼
12194,"i cant even download the game updates not deleting it to 80gb download nah
"
12195,Great gameplay
12196,its meh
12197,"This game is extremely buggy. I can't make it through a MyCareer game or a Neighborhood game without the game shutting itself down. Unless you want to save the game every few minutes in MyCareer, you will have to replay a lot of games. I have tweaked many of the PC, graphic card, and game settings to see if I could resolve the issue, but the problem continues. The game looks great and I have no lag issues. Be aware of the 3rd/4th quarter automatic shutdown. I also purchased the game on the xbox for the kids and have never experienced a single issue. Seems to be mostly a PC problem.

Update: 12/7/2019 - After speaking with 2k20 tech support we reinstalled my graphics driver and changed a game file. It did the trick. Now its running around 144 and not a single crash in 26 hours."
12198,There are too many microtransactions ruining the experience!

12204,Don't care about negative review. If you like Basketball game this is the Best.
12205,Kanser olduk ama oynamaya devam.
12206,It's still a grind and god forbid you have a job and can't play much because when you end up on the park with your bronze badge people just walk away from you no matter what your OVR is but overall it's great fun and I enjoyed the storyline.
12207,"Very fun with friends, would recommend. Sometimes will get you to rage quit tho."
12208,I have only played this game for 4 hours and already love it 👍
12209,"massive improvement over 2K18/19, gameplay feels fun, myteam challenges feel fair, and I'm actually having fun this year while LIVE 21 is in development :)"
12210,we be ballin
12211,Nice game but if u play w/friends
12212,mantap anjeng
12213,Pretty much the same cash grabbing game as last year
12214,Its alright
12215,Very predatory microtransactions and literal gambling aside its probably the best basketball game on the market. I wouldn't recommend buying unless its on sale and even then you might be better off not buying.
12216,so nıce basketball game
12217,"Broken game full of countless game breaking bugs and glitches. Cannot even save my game, constant crashes, visual glitches, and so much more to even list...."
12218,"2K Fans here,For 2K20 buy on Offer with Standard Edition. too easy to earn VC in mycareer. New play style but old play park zzz hope next 2K21 can upgrade."
12219,"Best basketball game out there, but with the same cons of their previous installments...microtransactions, unplayable multiplayer, a bit of grinding...but the single player mode is very good (better than previous ones imo)"
12220,"If you like being the GM and that kind of thing this game is worth it while on sale. Otherwise, the servers are full of hackers or aren't really working and that absolutely sucks. Also remember that everyday there's an update that takes forever to finish."
12221,Its good when u have a controller
12222,the mechanics are horrible and it is not fluid...the game is broken.
12223,Isn't even that bad
12224,Good Game!

12232,pretty good if u dont play online
12233,kelly olynk is da goat
12234,.
12235,Its the same game as last year
12236,"90% of what I play in this game is single player. I have read reviews about the multiplayer being filled with bugs and I can't speak to that. I also only paid $30 for it which I feel is fair. You know what you get with NBA2k: an unethical $60 price tag for a game that should be free to play with all the microtransactions. If you are a fan of the last 4 2k games nothing in this one will surprise you, but you're likely to like this one as well. Same game as the last one, same microtransactions as the last one, still fun for an NBA fan imo. DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS GAME."
12237,Not bad at all!
12238,better than previous few years
12239,it's okay for me since i skipped 2k19.
12240,"fun with friends
"
12241,It's the only basketball game you could buy
12242,waste of money.
12243,"You'd think after how long they've been making this game they'd get it right by now. If you play my player like I do good luck starting out because you start as a tree, if you have to guard anyone worth while they're going to run straight past you with 0 help from your team on defense, and oh yeah the game doesn't let you skip until you're on the court. If you try to skip it will just slow the game down (yes it will actually go in slow mo) until you spam alt-tab. Fix your damn game, listen to the people who actually spend money and buy it, its pretty insane I paid 60$ for this garbage."

12274,good
12275,"Buy on sale to get your yearly B-ball fix.    Leveling up your my player is much quicker this year.  IN previous years, just playing my career, without any park games, it would take 1-2 years of full 12 min season games and full play off championship rounds to reach level 99 without boosting or exploits. This year, It takes roughly 1 full season and a handful of game to get to 99.

With 170 hours logged in, as of writing this review; I've reached level 99 with my first created character (1 championship season and 6 games),   and currently 93 with my second character after only 54 games.

12283,"Waste of money, don't buy it"
12284,Honestly it's not great game if you experienced many issues but overall it's still best basketball game. Park is really fun to grind but even better when you join a good team. Many activities are able so there's no a dull moment if you are real basketball/ nba fan
12285,Nice game! I like it!
12286,trash but i still play it dafuq
12287,It's a nice game to play with friends
12288,ג
12289,Decent if u play with friends. park is full of cheaters. hopefully we get some cross-platform so the park is more alive and a new anti-cheat sistem.
12290,"It's buggy, laggy at times, and the as per usual the mycareer story is lac luster and even more railroaded than before."
12291,"what. why. good with friends.
"
12292,It was a little better than 2k19
12293,MyLeague has gotten worse every year for the past several games and the glitches carry over from one game to the next. This year the new glitches are players signing with ai teams for unrealistically short contracts or for way lower value than they are worth and every time you try to sign a rookie after their rookie scale contract expires it glitches and signs them to a one year minimum contract no matter how much or how long you signed them for.
12294,They should Improve the MyTeam Mode. Matchmaking is not fair. I have 80 and 79 overall and always match me with people with pink diamond cards and galaxy cards.

I keep coming back to try after new updates but apparently 2k can't fix this problem. I'm going to request a refund even though I'm positive it's too late. Bad form 2k. A very EA style game this year."
12299,if your only going to play on the mycareer thing it is an amazing game but multiplayer is horrible. love the game and hope you do to if you end up buying it. definitely recommended
12300,It's getting more and more predatory every year. It's not worth it if you already have 2k19. Just play that.

12307,"If you just like to play the single player it is alright (except when player models don't load in), but everything else is either exactly like past iterations of the game. There is nothing new and really should be criminal due to the gambling aspects of the online play. You buy fake in game money for a CHANCE to get the players you want (that will become obsolete in a year). This aspect of the game is gambling with no age restriction (which is illegal). If it were age restricted, fine blow your money however you want, but the fact a 9 year old can swipe their parents credit card, buy fake money with real money and gamble buying packs is immoral and illegal."
12308,crashes over and over there are no fixes to it please help
12309,The same game like last year.

12320,great game when it works
12321,"Better then NBA Live. But the match making i trash in Myteam, started playing with emeralds, getting matchups with pink diamond players. Some of the new players cards in Myteam are far from reality, Ming shooting 3s, Larry Bird shooting from the midle court. Hard for new players to like the game if you can't win"
12322,its a good game IF u ONLY play MyTeam

12332,"From what I've experienced so far, the game looks fine. The main problem I have is that the player models in Create Player don't change based on the settings I apply to them. I tried exiting out of Create Player, and it looks as though it hangs on that menu. If there was a way to refund, I certainly would."

12336,"I HAVE NOTHING POSTIVE TO SAY ABOUT THE GAME SO HERE IS A SONG FROM POST MALONE 

Blame It On Me by Post Malone

I used to say I was free
Now all these people wanna keep on taking pieces of me
They take away everything, had everything that I needed
They held me down, let me drown
They spit me out right through the teeth
I can't pretend, ash in the wind, won't blow again
It was a breeze for you
These hurricanes inside of my brain, let it rain
Made it look easy
Can't look away, you love the pain, you love the pain

Watchin' me bleed
You cut me down on my knees
No matter what you believe
I think we both can agree

That you can't blame it on me, yeah
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

Everyday's the same, yeah, I just watch 'em go
As I scrape away through the impossible
Yeah, I played the game but it was all for show
Tryna find my way, I nearly lost it though
Now I see dead people, most have no faith
Where did the time go? A watch with no face
They hit the ceiling but my roof likes space
I took my chances so won't you

Blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me, ayy
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault, not my fault

It's all my fault that I'm addicted to the clothes
It's all my fault, I paid the cost, yeah
It's all my fault that I ain't givin' up my soul
It's all my fault

Watchin' me bleed
You cut me down on my knees
No matter what you believe
I think we both can agree

That you can't blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself I did it all
You can't blame it on me, ayy
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

Blame it on me, yeah
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault"
12337,"NBA 2K20 is amazing on the playground. The new physical model, the impact of the new defensive system and the fine tuning of the gameplay is something valuable which give to basketball lovers endless possibilities. Perfect  GM mode is very good and 2K business model for MyTeam is still make me happy. The good news is that microtransations are quite useless in MyCareer mode, which thanks to King James work shines again to its original beauty."

The my career story is amazing, the gameplay is great, it has everything you need in a basketball game to have fun both playing solo and with friends. Hope 2K puts more effort into making the online experience better for everyone in next editions, otherwise, I guess I'll have to start playing it in PS4"

12375,"better than 2019 was, but still...."
12376,"If you look at this game from a pure gameplay perspective, it's awesome. the passing, dribbling, shooting animations are all fluid and good. The graphics are also good, same as last year. It's not the jump from last gen that we saw with 2K14, but they're still realistic and accurate. The problem lies in pretty much everything else - the connection issues, the microtransactions, the non existent dev team that isn't willing to fix the game and instead decide to add in even more MTX, and so on. All these issues are forcing me to not recommend you this game, and instead wait for when they'll eventually fix this (I hope). As it stands right now, NBA 2K20 is a broken mess."
12377,"Is it better than last year? Yes
Is it a perfect game? No

Great game even for casual NBA fans
My personal critique is the missing Story mode continuation from the last couple of seasons in MyGM"

12382,"Vastly disappointed that they didn't properly de-texturize LeBron's hairline...

Other than that, I enjoyed the tweaks to mycareer and with the dribble system. Story is much better this year. Their heavy emphasis on VC this season seems like it is pushing people towards buying VC to expedite character progression. Regardless of these blatant attempts to generate additional revenue, new additions to 2k's gameplay makes it feel fresh."

Oh not convinced? when i purchased this game and opened it, the icon tray at the bottom HAD THE 2k19 ICON! Yes... they actually forgot to change the windows icon from 2k19 to 2k20.

12405,"Still bad, but better than 2k19 imo, still it is the only basketball game that we have!"
12406,"let's be real

play a different game not from 2k
or buy it on console
as always they don't know how to put a free anti-cheat in there

-update
[i]
made one myplayer a free agent after a season because i wanted to go into another team.. that softlocked my game
will now always crash, bye 99ovr character

don't buy this game

12407,"Its 2k and it delivers what you would expect. Not exceptional, but a good 2k game"
12408,"Better than last year's version, but still too focused on pushing microtransactions. Also, unskippable ads are bad."
12409,"It's a great basketball game. There are some annoying issues with connection sometimes. At times there's noticable lag in multiplayer, but it's rather issue with connection of your opponent than servers issue. I haven't notice any pressure to buy VC and you can improve your player quickly by just playing MyCareer mode. In my opinion it's a good game."
12410,Good.
12411,"Look, its sh1t, but its the best we've got so it is what it is."
12412,splash splash
12413,its ight
12414,Best basketball game i've ever played!!
12415,This game is amazing no cap
12416,"Game itself is good looking, but not much have changed since the NBA2K19... (If we are not counting casino)"
12417,"I can not at all relate to any of the negative criteria I have read so far in these reviews. It is the currently best Basketball simulation we have on the market. Sure that's not tough when you have only NBA Live as concurrece. Until this point in time I do not feel that you have to put any money into the game which is avery big difference comparing to 2K18, my last part of the series. Everybody is just lost in nostalgia towards 2K16 and 17 which have surely been very good but I think 2k20 can at least keep up with them. 
This is a recommendation to EVERYBODY out there what loves our beatiful sport and video games. To me a rocksolid 9,5/10!"
12418,Trash
12419,very funny game love playing basketball
12420,This game is not worth 50€
12421,=]
12422,"It is not perfect and 2k have been scamming us gamers for years now. But there is really no other alternative and even with its flaws, it is the best basketball there is on the market (well, its not hard as it is only one that really matters). I enjoy it however."
12423,haha game bad ronny want money
12424,Only worth buying if you plan on playing offline game modes. This game is riddled with cheaters and exploits online for Steam.
12425,Same trash as 2k19
12426,Good game.
12427,GRIND NEVER STOPS
12428,"EDIT: 386 hours later and yeah, still pretty much the same review. Been having fun with MyCareer, but MyLeague mode is one of the most complete league simulation modes I've played in a sports game. I'm really enjoying the customization aspect, setting up my own league and teams etc. It's not quite on par with Football Manager or OOTP but it's great fun. Good game despite its annoyances!

Original Review: This game has some minor annoyances, but I play it for the story mode of MyCareer which has been fun. There are times when it seems the difficulty changes based on no discernible event, but I still enjoy the game. This is the best NBA basketball game that isn't NBA Jam, and it works for me."
12429,Same shit as last year. Don't buy. Wait for sale.
12430,Very very very nice game
12431,"I like it, I didnt purchase extra VC, I want my player to progress so it was worth the play."
12432,Trash
12433,good good
12434,god
12435,not as grindy as 2k19. Only playing solo my career - lovin it!

12446,"For me all i wanted was my career. 
So i was happy.
Refuse to touch the casino."
12447,Not an enjoyable game
12448,"if you have played the other 2k games you will see the comparison
"
12449,i love it's feature its dope!!
12450,"Offline play such as MyCareer, the game is fantastic. Multiplayer is laggy and actually unplayable. The ads are a completely disrespect to people paying full price and they should be ashamed of themselves. Their support system is by far the most pathetic and worthless thing I've ever seen. Had an error during a Trivia event, sent in a ticket and they basically told me ""Too bad, you will have to wait until the next Trivia to try again"". Didn't buy 2K19, thought this was going to be different but made that mistake. Also to add to the love for 2K, these morons advertised ""MyPlayer Nation"", a MyCareer add-on at the start of the NBA season and guess what? PC players can kindly take a middle finger. We pay the same price as XBOX and PS4 yet we don't get the complete game. Well played 2K, 10/10 most ruthless company ever."
12451,This is a good game
12452,good
12453,"After you try it on console, on PC this game is literally unplayable. Input lag with the controller is the worst. It's just not optimized well. The launch price of this thing on Steam should be half the console edition price, end of story. Save your nerves lads."
12454,"Not worth 60. No 2K in awhile is. Get it on sale. You'll still feel like you overpaid but ya know its better than 60.
Cause if you gonna get it you gonna get it."
12455,"Great MyCareer experience(personal opinion, idk whether u weren't willing to grind for VC)

as for the others gamemodes I didn't really check them out so can't comment on them

overall same mechanics as NBA 2K19

dunking on or posterising opponents is still quite tricky to constantly do so most of my matches consisted of either teammates shooting 3s or me going in for a contested layup

ps. the interview animations and dialogues look and sound really awkward so maybe for 2K21 they could make them sound more realistic and less robotic
"
12456,"If you're looking for a basketball sim, you just cant beat 2K. Despite there shady practices with VC and getting money hungry, its still a good basketball game.
I purely play mycareer and myleague and have zero issues, though i've heard online play can be a shit show at times."
12457,"good game
"
12458,"I don't understand all of the negative reviews. It is a great game, and I definitely recommend it. Way better than 2k19."
12459,the game does not work
12460,its good
12461,It's painfully  okay.
12462,Trash Game
12463,"k
"
12464,"Before you buy i hope you read. I received this game for free from 2k as i have played and given my hard earned money away for years supporting this title. i have not read any other reviews about it and i am waiting to do so after i write this. last year i gave up on this franchise. i was tired of their in game ads they made me watch and their lack of concern for what the community was really wanting from this game so vowed not to buy it again. about a month ago i received a free code for the game in my email and thought okay i will at least try it but i refused to buy any VC and still have not purchased any. there are two things i feel they got right with this game; 1. myteam cards evolve now and no more silly badges. 2. the shot mechanics feel alot better than previous years. 
Now for the bad;  the game does not flow like it did in previous years. everything seems almost on a lag even when playing against the computer. the movements are slower. the passing does not move like it should. i have seen this in previous years with dribbling or shooting but there is no getting use to this. the response time from when a button is pushed to when the action occurs seems slowed down. 
i give up after the time i spent on it. 60 hours should have got my muscle memory and timing corrected but it hasnt. the game is just slow for some reason and i cant get around this. they need to speed up the response time from the controller inputs to make the game play actually flow the way it should."
12465,good
12466,"They re-use a ton of the same lazy (bad) art aspects from the past few years (the locker rooms from 2k18 along with the same exact MyCourt, most of the neighborhood, etc...). 

While they bumped up how much VC you earn for doing things to make you feel better about it (and to believe 2k Sports was being the good guys for once), they also bumped up the VC cost of everything. Yes, you can still buy your way to a 90+ rated player with real $$. Speaking of real $$, have you heard of MyTeam? Because that's a gamblers dream... Of course they probably think people enjoy it's ""surprise mechanics"". They want you to spend upwards of $50 real money to open 10 packs to chase high tier player cards that are completely useless in a few months. Greed is poured all over this sloppy mess of a game.

You know that audio bug that's been there ever since the NBA 2k series came to PC? Yeah, that is STILL THERE. It's occurred in every version for the past 10 YEARS. It's pretty comical at this point.

The 2k devs are awful and are clearly full on in ""don't care auto-pilot mode"" and have been for the past 5 years now.

I can't recommend this and I got it for 60% off. I can't recommend it at any price (even the current 85% off!). It's seriously that bad.

**EDIT** 2K is dumpster tier at this stage. Dion Waiters was traded by the Heat on FEBRUARY 6th, 2020. He's still on the Heat roster in this game. WHY? I was ecstatic when the Heat got rid of his lazy ass and these lazy devs are making me live the nightmare of him being on the team still. Why in the hell is this game $69 + $50000 in microtransactions and these developers can't even keep a roster SOMEWHAT current? They also did some updates to the gameplay which ruin the experience. I don't want a full on sim, I want semi-sim. If I wanted to have to deal with bulls**t fouls, I'd go play at the gym again. CPU defenders stick to you like glue but burst past you every time they drive. Even the bottom tier 3rd stringers. They make damn near impossible shots with a perfect shot way more frequently than ever before. This game is a joke. Do yourselves a favor and boycott the NBA2K franchise until this greedy studio with lazy developers realize they need to change."
12467,fire ronnie get decent devlopers make game realistic dont have defenders who are on crack just sprinting around bodying people

12479,"This game is practically trash especially if is you are buying this for it's online feature. There are just way TOO MANY HACKERS on east asian servers. Also, steam (unlike Playstation store) also couldn't care anymore about this than 2k. You will ABSOLUTELY get no support, no refund (after you exhaust support requests to fix hacking) for/due to the same."
12480,asd
12481,"Quite possibly the worst 2k i've ever played.

- The online community is horrible, and especially non-existent. I can't even play an online park/rec game. The courts are empty 90% of the time.
- The game feels extremely grindy in mycareer. Too many cutscenes.
- I was accused of hacking by a player in the game. I had a losing record. That should go to show how poor the community is. I'm making this point twice just to make it known that if you're playing by yourself, people will make fun of you with the emotes in-game for literally no reason. Toxicity at its finest.
- Hall of Fame mycareer is too hard below 82 overall, and too easy to cheese/exploit after that.
- Commentators in the game frequently repeat themselves, post-game interviews also a lot of repeating lines/dialogue.
- The only redeemable part of the game is the pre-nba story of your player, but even then it's marred by LONG cutscenes that suck up so much of your time. Before you know it, your 2 hour window for playtime is gone with a whopping 15 minutes of actual gameplay.

SAVE YOUR MONEY, YOUR SOUL, AND YOUR WELL BEING! DON'T BUY THIS GAME."
12482,"Super buggy and the whole dev team lied about every feature they promised, they money grab with the position switching in my team, and it gets insanely stale with the events never working"
12483,its good
12484,"I never really post reviews, but wow I have to give major props to the people who handled the presentation in game time. Overall NBA 2k20 is kinda sleazy with the micro-transactions. But, when it comes to overall presentation and simulation... WOW this game is tops. 

Say I try to make a tight pass to a guy cutting to the basket... If my player realistically could pull that off the play looks gorgeous! Far better than previous years... the play looks like two players in sync executing the way professionals do. When I make bonehead plays and turn the ball over... it looks like a player had a lapse in judgement... maybe even tries to take it back but cannot... IT IS GORGEOUS!!!

The Story in the My Player mode is actually pretty good as well. I used to be solely a Franchise Mode guy, but this year's story mode is fairly good. I doubt I'll continue it long, but the initial story is good. The micro-transactions really nerf how good your player can be unfortunately. You can have a solid experience, but there is a limit to how good you can get compared to the other pros without investing $$$. 

Franchise mode is so amazingly good this year. I watch teams make intelligent trade proposals! At least mostly... better than previous years. The coaching options like Defensive Match-ups and Strategy screens are simultaneously deeper and easier to understand at the same time! How is that even possible!

The play by play is also outstanding. I get near, actual interviews that are somehow contextual to the actions in the game (again for the most part). I hear J.R. Smith get interviewed and talk about how we were driving the ball to the hole so well... and that's actually true... it's an actual interview that is contextually relevant to the goings on of my particular execution of a simulation... that's just uncanny awesome.

I know at this point I sound like a fanboy... Well I am. This is a great game. The people in charge of the presentation deserve major praise for this achievement. 

Seriously, everyone responsible for every part of the presentation of this game deserves MAJOR PRAISE!!"

12505,"Been playing NBA 2K, mostly MyLeague, for as long as I can remember, and this version's gameplay is fantastic in my opinion. There is now a certain weight to the players that make the game more realistic than ever.
WHEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY PLAY... Now the game crashes, straight to desktop, no warning, no error message, nothing. Can be in the menu, during gameplay, making substitutions in-game. Well done 2K, seriously...
I run a very decent rig, RTX2070 SP, installed on SDD."

12511,Is playable without spending a fuck ton of money on vc. There are bugs but overall the game play is pretty good and its a solid game despite the gate.
12512,"I do not recommend any game from 2K ever again. They are money grabbing bunch of heartless people. I have played 1,224 hours on this game, spent hundreds of dollars on VC for both MyTeam and MyPlayer. After all that they ban my account, permanently, for using a trainer to extend a quarter length in a domination game against CPU that I have already completed months ago, I just did it to evolve some cards and to have fun. I have said sorry to their support, said I was wrong, I did not know it is against the rules, and asked if they can give me a time ban instead a permanent ban. But they don't want to hear it. So I have spent hours of my time and a lot of money and they just kick me out for using a cheat, just once, against CPU, and deny me access to a game I payed for. It's a disgrace. I am not buying anything from 2K ever again."

12518,Yes EXCEPT MyCareerNation isn''t on PC
12519,c
12520,GOOD GAME
12521,If you can get past the micro-transactions its the best basketball game out there. Its a shame that the micro-transactions to buff your player bog it down that much! Although you do get a lot of free VC through the challenges and videos etc. Overall i'd recommend it!
12522,so great game im so enjoy playing it
12523,"Good For Solo Play, Anything besides that is trash."
12524,"this game definitely has its good and bad sides but overall its a good game.

theyve cleaned up the mechanics of the previous years by a long way, theyve developed how bigs work, offensive rebounding is possible now, ball handling is cleaner, movement is more fluid, the collision mechanics are far more advanced... sufficed to say there is a huge amount of improvements over previous games.

sure there are micros and some annoying episodes of something or rather at the start of games but who cares.. like your time is that valuable anyway lol 


its a good game."
12525,I cant find a match!!!!
12526,"DO NOT BUY. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME. SO DISPOINTED ABOUT 2K SERIES NOW. The MC mode is too hard, it takes way too long to get the VC to upgrade your player if you don't purchase VC in game.  You don't have enough VC to upgrade your player, your player is like trash, no agility, hard to make shot, can't keep up with AI's speed, even you have a chance for free throw, it's hard to make it, because your free threw is under 50 when you are just started the season. For fully upgrade your player you will need around 20k VC, not including all the animations, clothes shoes, or stuff like that.At your first season, you would probably get 750VC as your salary plus your performance, so you will get around 800-900 VC every game. Even you can get extra VC from other contracts and team practice, I would say you will need at least 2 seasons for fully upgrade your player. Plus you need to farm for the badges, the badges is based on your performance on court such as making shots, assists and rebounds etc. But if you don't have high abilities it's gonna be hard for you, therefore kind of force you to buy VC."
12527,just brutal. and nothing some QA testing and extra code monkeys couldn't fix
12528,SI
12529,good game
12530,Every year the same tragic product. BAd game cheaters everywhere bugs more than any other 2k in the history of 2k. the company doesnt care about pc customers only consoles . NBA LIVE wake up all the people will buy  it if EA will create proper game. 2K= trash take advantage on MOnopoly thats all
12531,great game if you know what your doing and not someone who is complaning thats its to hard to get badges and rank up when its really not its been like this since 15

12567,"It's a really good game with great graphics and gameplay. People complain about you needing to spend money on VC to progress, but in MyTeam it just isn't the case for 2 reasons:
1. It's really easy to get good players right off the bat; after just 5 minutes of play I got 2 85-rated cards and an 89-rated card.
2. The game puts you in matches with you own skill level and team quality as yours.
I've heard people tell others not to buy this, but YOU are the only person who can say whether or not you like this game: NOBODY ELSE."

12591,"2k does not give a shit about it's player base on PC. The park right now is crawling with hackers. There are people whose character models are so big their arms stretch across half of the park. All they have to do is ban anyone who enters park over a certain height or weight. There are also no legends yet so anyone coming in as a legend or with clothing on they didn't actually unlock could easily be banned. This is one of my favorite games to play, but in this state I won't even play it. I've been scammed and robbed of my money and time. There is no way in fucking hell I am getting another 2k until I see they stop with the bull shit."

12616,"I play this game for my career, my GM and other single player things. If you want online buy it for XBOX because the pc community on this game is weak and it'll be hard to find matches late at night. Also online is where they take your money. But the basketball simulation is unmatched."
12617,"Same shit every year... EA, please save us from this game. I'm waiting for Live 21."
12618,great game
12619,"Good Game, why not ?"
12620,Nice Game
12621,Full of problems game
12622,2k all the way!
12623,gud gim solo wif 4 nigger conect
12624,Fun game
12625,"I thought to myself, how bad can this be. I just want to play a little GM mode. The people that made this game don't play the game themselves. It is so bad that after several attempts to live with all the things wrong with it, I have given up. Don't waste one dime on this crappy game. Graphics are the only thing good."
12626,good
12627,y
12628,good
12629,Ball is life.
12630,this game is very fun to play
12631,THEY STOP THE EVENT IN MY CARRER MODE CPU PLAYER IS VERY BAD EVEN IF YOU PLAY IN HALL OF FAME DIFFUCLITY
12632,hire more developers and look at other community wishlist items... this release is like usual a strong B-
12633,I really like the way the games runs and the graphics.
12634,"Good game, but online is 70% hackers"
12635,"nice game
"
12636,c
12637,"Great game for basketball player, I've been playing this games since 2k14 and IMO this is the best basketball game ever! MyCareer is always my favorite mode in this game xD"
12638,garbage.
12639,Its crashing likes every 8 minutes for no reason
12640,"well the games good so far, i think.... but online session is really bugging me on SEA here
edit:
game sucks very micro transaction oriented"
12641,...
12642, sweet!
12643,"I don't see why people keep hating on the 2k games , they call ""graphics and roster updates only"" or the criticize the bugs and glitches of the game , and my answer to this is that no game is perfect , each year 2k is trying to give us new features to enhance our gameplay and in my opinion it does , so i reccomend everyone to buy NBA 2K20 because im absolutely loving this game"
12644,worst game  ever made by 2k pay to win all the way
12645,more realistic than past iterations
12646,gud
12647,"Ok. Giving 2k20 a positive review.
Animations and AI logic are polished even more, as usual.
*Layups and under the basket layins are way easier to miss now and no longer a 100% guarantee.*
There are all kinds of gathers included in shot bases now for smoothess.
Can just switch to MyLeague if you want to edit shot signatures.
No quick and slow release options anymore.
Game is a little too slow on default but just increase the sliders.
Uniform selection is great with on the fly accessory color adjustments.
They seem to have gotten rid of city jerseys though.
NO BLACKTOP 21.
8/10."
12648,"If you only wanna play MyCareer, it's a sick game.
I've never bought VC and never will. I'm in the playoffs of my 1st season, with 80 hours of gameplay and MyPlayer is a 91 overall, to give you an idea!
NOT a supporter of 2K and their snake ways tho, lest we forget."
12649,trash game
12650,dont play online.
12651,"Despite all the neagative reviews (which are mostly due to the shady microtrasactions, which I won't defend in any way), this game is a lot of fun and features the most fleshed out franchise mode (my gm, whatever) out of any major sports game this side of Football Manager. There are some performance issues I've encountered, but nothing game breaking. The game updates stats as the NBA season goes along and it's easily the best virtual representation of the sport available on the market. It can have grindy elements, but if you don't mind that, buy it."
12652,Awesome game. Awesome graphics. One of the best NBA 2K games. The gameplay is also very good and realistic. I highly recommend NBA 2K20
12653,good
12654,cool game. best nba ever
12655,best game ever
12656,lik
12657,The offence and defence mechanics feels better. Making it more realistic.
12658,like it
12659,Pretty solid 2k game much better than 2k18 for sure. Gameplay is decent and buidling players is pretty fun. VC is kind of hard to get this 2k
12660,i like it all
12661,"Honestly just not worth. It's a repackaged 2k19. Tbh, all NBA2K games are just repackages. Last half unique game was 2k11."
12662,"They cut vc earning in half 2 weeks after launch. And there are ads. Unskipable, fucking ads in a fully priced game. Seriously, if you are reading this, don't buy this game.

Also, there is an update every other day and they never tell you wtf it is you are installing."
12663,Servers!!!!
12664,"I have tried every game mode, the only thing missing is the good old dunk contest."
12665, This game sucks. but there is no other better nba game so i play this piece of crap
12666,s
12667,"Games is trash, opponent 3pt with and i do 100 percent defense is make and me shot a 3pt completely free misses, opponent shots crazy and make but my no makes shots. A very bad game for all I play in 2k"
12668,"After having 2K20 for about two weeks I have to say it's pretty impressive.  Initially all the bugginess was a headache but figured on PC at least for me you have to keep it at 60fps and have vertical sync active.  I'm pretty much a My Career mode player and the level of detail that went into making this game is amazing, every year they include more and more.  I've finally just accepted the VC micro-transactions but understand how that can be a big deal for some.  Overall I would say this is a hell of a game that offers something for everyone."
12669,GREAT GAME. Makes me refunded it
12670,best ever
12671,I have tried everything including reloading my OS. This game crashes randomly no matter what I do.  I would not recommend this game to anyone. I have played all of the NBA 2k games on PC for years and this one is by far the worst working product I have seen them produce. This is probably the last time I will waste money on a 2K title at all to be honest.
12672,"it crashed when i play the game, out of nowhere the game closed for many times, sucks"
12673,cheaters all around
12674,"Best 2k yet, imo."
12675,Such an unbelievably shit game. I don't know how they do it. At this point it must be intentional. Shooting is so bad. It is impossible to make any jumpshot if you dont green it. AI teammates dont help at all because they are determined to iso into a miss 100% of the time. I'm convinced at this point that 2K does whatever they can to make the gameplay so shit that you wont want to grind for vc and just buy it instead. Rather play NBA live at this point even if it is dead
12676,excellent. close to reality
12677,crashes a lot
12678,awful
12679,"Possibly the shittiest AAA game I've played (the gameplay itself isn't too bad, but it has a shit ton of bugs that they could easily fix, like they do on consoles, but they simply don't give a shit)

"
12680,I like it after you play it for a while it gets smooth and i love mypark
12681,best game
12682,"There is no difference between it and 2K19,but ,if you want to get latest rookie list and palyer parameter  . you can buy it .Don't play park mode in My career because so many people cheating .at last .Lakers champion

shit server"
12683,"I have typically always played one major sporting game each year growing up (which has usually been FIFA) however with my emerging love for basketball, I begun playing more NBA last year mixed in with FIFA and this year it's my primary game. 

I would recommend anyone who enjoys offline sport games to give NBA a try when it's on sale, I'm not big on playing the game online and I rarely have however the offline content in MyCareer (havent played it this year but I assume it's similar to last year which I enjoyed), MyTeam (Spotlight series, updated triple threat with more rewards, domination) and MyLeague (Always fun trying to make your favourite team the best) continue to provide endless avenues of fun for the player whilst challenging them just the right amount.

I don't play online and I always hear a lot of backlash for their servers. I don't play MyTeam unlimited or triple threat online (only have played a half dozen games of Triple Threat Online) but I would recommend sourcing more reviews for information on their online play.

Overall, would recommend NBA2k20 if you enjoy playing offline and against the AI in MyTeam, if you want to play online, consult other reviews which discuss the 2K servers."
12684,"10/10
"
12685,"I just like 2k and thats it 
"
12686,This game is bad
12687,fun
12688,Good game
12689,I like 2k
12690,f
12691,"server's still  a piece of trash, still no online cheating ban system. I mean......just a piece of trash
"
12692,"the game crashes more times than i can preform a dribble move, after re launching once or twice it seems to chill but still dagum annoying"
12693,"This game sucks save your time and momey.  Its all microtransactions, the only good game mode is myleague."
12694,"Great game, same thing every year but there isnt much else you can do. This year shooting takes more skill than the others which is nice so random people just dont magically pop in and buy 500k VC and have a 80overall right out of the get go and can make difficult shots. Also the badges are different, now you can choose which badge to upgrade to get the most out of the early and help you improve the character. MyPlayer or bust."
12695,great
12696,Same sh** different 2k. if you like basketball... why not?
12697,just play freestyle 2 street basketball it's a way better game anyway.
12698,"So much like everyone else there are a plenty of faults found with this game and the latest pushed me into adding to the negative reviews.  I've racked up plenty of time to really find positives to recommend, but too many flaws that 2k add in just knock it down.  So let's go section by section:

General Gameplay:

Nothing major changed; it's still a fun game so if this was a standalone noone would mind rather than a yearly update.

Music:

As good as ever, the soundtrack is something that 2k get right.

Game intro:

I haven't had much of the ads that others have complained about, but that's cause I'm UK so guessing USA based players get it worse.  Anyway, 2kTV remains pretty rubbish and has been since 2k18 or even before.  Too much emphasis on the 2k League and just keeps replaying.

MyLeague:

Pretty much as before, nothing new and still solid and you can have a bit of fun with your favourite team but no movement forward.

MyGM:

Completely ruined this time with this AP thing.  You can either play games or do GM stuff and even still very little; definite negative versus 2k19.

MyCareer:

Player development:

So set up and development seems crazy capped as even with 84 rating that I currently have I don't have a single stat even in the 70s and half done over half my upgrades.  Also when setting up your player you can't for example create a Ben Simmons PG copy as doesn't allow you to go that tall; needs more thought.

Single Player part is too short in terms of story.  It could have been more, but they just half arsed a serious issue in terms of the college basketball system; this should have been filled out more certainly.  The combine is nice at least with the workouts but it's not as good as previous years, because of how short it feels.

Now Multi Player to talk about.  There are still so many faults with this.  So much pay to win and flaws with the system means that someone who is an amateur like me can't enjoy it; feels like being bullied as a kid when you were told you couldn't play with the big kids.  Today I had a 1v1 game that was 18-18 and hard fought and I fouled out (opponent had 5 fouls) and it kicks you without giving any rep or VC for the long game and this was the longest 1v1 equally matched game I played and that just made me angry and that sums up playing multiplayer with 2k overseeing, anger!  There isn't a separation for amateur players like me versus the hardcore players so aside from the 1v1 it is incredibly hard to get a game to improve as others who have levelled up either through paying or hard work just step off those blue spots.  Seriously 2k you need to think harder about reaching the more casual players than you do.

The App:

Still the same as previous years, but I'm pretty sure it offers less VC than before.  This really needs a bit of a boost...  Also it times 24 hours for the 400 VC for quick games which means unless you log in at exactly the same time each day you are going to miss out on the poultry 400 on a semi regular basis.

All in all I still bought it, which is the crazy thing as there is nothing else out there for the NBA on PC and I guess that is what 2k bank on.  No matter the flaws you will still buy no matter what and unfortunately that is largely the case, so no matter how many bad reviews 2k20 gets I will still probably end up buying 2k21 and that is part of the problem."
12699,Milion bugs.
12700,Game manages to slightly improve while also managing to shit on itself.
12701,Great game and really realist best NBA game out there
12702,edrfs
12703,"It's one of the worst games I've ever seen in my entire life, but it's the only basketball game that we have, so I have to deal with it, because I love basketball."
12704,Annoying frequent long un-skippable cuts in almost every my player game and most modes.
12705,"Yeah uhm. Absolute unoptimized pile of trash to be honest. So many bugs, so many crashes. Incredibly hard to get into an online game with your friends. It's really sad because the gameplay and the core of the game are really good and enjoyable, it just gets absolutely ruined by the things mentioned above.

If you manage to get into a lag-free game without it taking like 30 minutes its an absolute blast. Sadly that basically never happens."
12706,My career mode is fun same with park
12707,the game is trash the 2K has to go bankrupt I hope all devs die
12708,ya is good game
12709,"On the surface this seems like a decent basketball game but it is not. Offline mode is decent enough, i guess. The AI picks up on what you're doing and tries to make you frustrated the entire time you play. Online mode is where it gets even worse. The community is full of toxic people that talk trash for no reason. Don't buy this game on PC if you value your sanity. There are constantly players with hacked attributes that are ruining the game for everybody. 2k doesn't care at all about hackers and will do nothing to stop them unless it affects their microtransaction scam. They are so short sighted they don't even care that you have a pleasant gaming experience."
12710,lots of bugs. cant sim to next appearance on my career mode.
12711,!
12712,It's the same as last year and the grind is retarded but I love it for some reason. The MyPlayer builder is the only thing that is different but it is greatly improved. Everything else is the same or shittier so pretty much don't buy it.
12713,"Trash game, trash company... I wish EA can be really competitive next year. 2k does not deserve any customers"
12714,Its Lit
12715,Good
12716,"Unskippable ads, the option to turn off 2ktv has been removed despite paying full price for the game. Tons of crashes and game freezes. MyCareer becomes unplayable some days. Stay away."
12717,cheaters
12718,"After 150 hours of MC playing, now I think I'm qualify to leave a fair comment.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm a player who have played through 2k11 to 2k20. Some are on PC and some are on console.
I focused on MC mode only.
Conclusion: The MC mode these years made me cancer.

Reason:
1. Years and years, MC mode story kept telling you about a young man chasing dream. But ironically the game mechanism tells you a different story. 
                                  YOU CANT BECOME AS GREAT AS THOSE LEGENDS DOES
You wanna be a great 3pts shooter like curry does?  OK.
You wanna be a great ball handler like curry at the same time?  Maybe.
You wanna be a great slasher like curry at the same time?  Nope, only average level, cause your life is limited.
What about defense? Nope, you are gonna be shitty on defense that everyone can one step dribble through you easily.
                                       YOU JUST CANT BE AS GREAT AS THOSE LEGENDS DOES
Really frustrating.

2. Stupid teammate AI and God like opponents AI
Old problems on MC are still there, and never seems to be fixed, or it's their purpose to do so.
How stupid the teammate AI is? Try call a pick, slash in, drag the defense under basket, and pass to the open C or PF teammate. Guess what? they will either hold the ball rather than shoot it immediately and wait for the defense covers him again and than shoot, or skip the offense chance and run a random play on the playbook.
WHY? HOW? Mystery.

3. The unreal RPG experiment 
RPG is a good mechanism, but not with a bad implementation.
In the story you'll be a 1st round about top ten picks player if you try hard.
But a weird thing happened. An overall rating 65 player in a lottery pick?
Dude, this guy can't even sink an open mid range!
Even my grandma can do it.
The only thing this guy can do as well as my grandma is the moving speed.
This dude, this lottery pick dude moves like he's carrying a 100KG bag on his back.
When ever he needs to do a sharp turn, it takes him 1.5 second.
He's in the fxcking NBA. And he needs 1.5 second to do a sharp turn. OMFG
When it comes to the situation that you've been double team, its ugly.
This dude cant even pass a ball anymore. 
This pathetic dude has played through the NCAA for four years, and when it comes to deal with the double team, he cant even pass the ball properly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not finished, but I'm tired and got to sleep.
Hope I wont be dreaming bout these crap.

12719,LItteraly Amazing in every way
12720,"garbage game, my teammates just stand there whilst letting the opponent just waltz on past, shit game, even worse cpu 'skill'"
12721,ששש
12722,good game
12723,"Alright, now I know 2K Sports caught a whole lot of flack for embracing the generally frowned-upon market of micro-transactions and basically releasing the same game with updated rosters and minor tweaks. Those things maybe aren't ideal, but the game is still fun, immersive and actually addictive as any NBA 2K game I've played. If you even mildly enjoyed the last release, it's a safe bet to say that you'll likely enjoy 2K20."
12724,"If you're into wasting hundreds of dollars on MyTeam or even MyCareer and get absolutely nowhere, then this game is definitely the one for you!"
12725,"shit , server connection sucks"
12726,bitch
12727,This game is crap they need to fix this
12728,doesn't even work on mouse and keyboard. How was I supposed to know that?
12729,"u know... As much as i hate the micro transactions or macro transactions i should say coz u know there isnt anything micro about asking for $100 for in game currency after already spending $60 on the game, what really kills me is that ill be playing a game in mycareer (despite everyone hating it i enjoy it) and have a 95 3 point shot with a good release and toss up a brick and then suddenly the a.i. on the opposing team comes out of no where and drops 94% contested shots and my team's a.i. forgets how to dribble and turns the ball over until I inevitably lose the game. I think it's pretty clear that 2k coded the game to fuck with to make u think that your not good enough to get you to spend more money. What bothers me the most though is I just like everyone else buy this game and buys vc despite them doing this year after year. We as a community are telling them we aren't happy nut we will gladly give u our money anyway."
12730,"Okay, game"
12731,"add an anticheat and fix the speed gap. make a difference between 80 speed and 95
dont promise things you cant make work ronnie. this game isnt playable on pc but i continue to do so"
12732,good game
12733,"216 hours played - this game is total trash. Trust me. Not worth your time. During my playtime I uninstalled this crap 2 times. MyTeam players are buying MT from chinese to get the best cards in game: multiplayer is rigged because of that. Offline gameplay sucks ass too - whatever new and cool cards you get in MyTeam, the AI will will still mop the floor with you. You constantly gain less MT than you're spending. Please stay away from this game - it's just wasting your time with pointless camera angles and replays wherever it can. And wait for it - every year your progress is wiped clean with new just slightly upgraded gameplay. It's only purpose is to make money. Honest review - I really want to like it but it's only taking advantage of players."
12734,trash game
12735,allot of errors and crash games and stopped !!!
12736,"This i a good game.However it would be much better if it didnt crash all the fucking time or it had some good fucking servers.I could be playing a game on mycarrer and it would just crash or disconnect me from the servers.It does happen constantly at least to me.So me and many others would appreaciate it if the shitty developers of this game would fix it.Fuck you 2k, fuck you."
12737,Pretty good!
12738,"Guaranteed way to get cancer and depression

10/10 - would play again"
12739,game suck!

In all honesty, it really is not THAT bad. I would recommend playing it, but get it on discount..."
12741,its ok just dont expect to be able to play online well
12742,its really good
12743,"2K as a company sucks fucking dick, thats always gonna be the case. This is still the best basketball game, until someone makes one without all the ads and pay to win bullshit"
12744,"Its a decent game

12746,Long story short the game is great.
12747,good
12748,"If you're looking through reviews and deciding if you should buy the game: DO NOT!

Online is fragile, for a 2 week period now I'm unable to log in to 2K servers, so unless you're playing ""Play Now"" mode with your buddies, do not buy this game, even when it's on sale as you're going to have it laying around in your library till the next 2K comes out."

12750,"It is terrible.
A lot of glitches,and it is broken.

12759,gaming at its finest :D
12760,"All bad things aside the A.I is at least a little competent now and adjust accordingly to the offense which makes for a more realistic feel to the game. Some animations are still ""annoying"" but is definately outwieghed by the positive aspects of the game. My advice is trial at a friends house before you buy its not for everyone, but imo the best 2k since 2k11
"
12761,dffgbh
12762,"The game is better than last year. Animations are better, no more sliding. The character building system is much better. The story in MyCareer is much better. The game is a lot more generous than before (although they reduced the VC rewards recently). You get a free daily wheel spin + free betting on real life games, for more rewards. I seriously don't know what the haters are complaining about. The drills are also better, you can choose which of finishing/shooting/playmaking/defense you want to work on. You can also choose (and respec) your badges. I'm enjoying the game more than previous years, it really deserves positive reviews. There are a few minor bugs, and a major one (the slow-down issue before simulating your time on the bench)."
12763,"Horrible game, I would not recommend this to anyone. I am a basketball fan and have been playing NBA 2k since 2k16. Each year it gets worse and worse. If you enjoy feeling like you want to rip your hair out, play this game - it's for you. If you enjoy basketball simulation, don't buy this game. Don't play this game. Stay far away from this game. 

I have put 330+ hours into NBA 2k20 and I refuse to load up and play the game anymore. I will no longer buy NBA 2k products. They have lost me as a customer forever because of 2k20. They sell you a broken game each year,  claiming it's better than last year but it's always broken. 2k20 was the final straw for me. They don't know how to fix it so you will never see a fix for all the bugs. False advertising everywhere in this game. STAY FAR AWAY from this game."
12764,"Great gameplay, although it's the same game as before and the microtransactions, i give it a positive"
12765,yeet
12766,mad
12767,"Unfinished game full of bugs, errors, glitches, connection issues and a thousand patches that solve one thing but ruin the other. The only reason i play this piece of sh*t game is that there is no other basketball game worth mentioning. So if you are not a hardcore basketball fan, just don't buy it."
12768,knice
12769,Best game
12770,dont buy it its waste of money
12771,"get on console
"
12772,"we all know that 2k is just the rebranded crap that we get every year. So instead of listing all of its normal, yearly flaws its preferable to 2k19 and 18. My career is actually not overwhelmingly cringy and the normal grind is still there, but they finally made it possible for you to not have to go to my park all the time. 

My team is almost identical though. 

Overall, best 2k in while, still as buggy as ever though."
12773,Im an exclusive offline player love sims and this is the best basketball one available while having solid offline gameplay

12809,"Overall, the game performed very well. The big gripes here are the microtransactions, which, to me, is not a problem if you actually put the time and effort into the game
Though, it would've been nice for the devs to open up more server or even possibly a Southeast Asian server for us third world country citizens"
12810,Cool experience

12816,"2K back again screwing their entire consumer base up the rear without lube by destroying the fun parts of the game and raising the bar of what should be allowed when it comes to micro-transactions.

You never listen to what WE want, all you care about is making money and you don't give a shit about your players what-so-ever.

Forced ads? Cutting VC gains in half so people buy more VC? Same park as 2k19? Riddled with hackers because you have NO ANTICHEAT? Higher prices for clothes/shoes then last year? Basically a reskin of 2k19? Lying about content?

You, as a company disgust me and stand for everything that's wrong with the gaming industry. The only thing that could make all of this worse, would be if you merged with EA to create the biggest pile of dick sucking, money whoring, shit gaming company of all time. At this point it feels like you keep pushing the boundaries of how much micro-transactions and bullshit you can throw in your player base's face before we finally say enough for good.

I hope people wake the fuck up and realize that if you keep buying games from this awful franchise they will just keep doing this shit, year after year after year. Hang up the shoes and find something better to do with your $60, and your time."

12829,so good
12830,"Honestly wouldn't recommend it.
Trash game, and doesn't get any better as years go on. Nothing has changed from 2k19. Cheaters still exist, there are still more errors/bugs/crashes than any other game i've ever SEEN.

update1 - the game still sux big dick

update2 - now it feels like NBA live

update3 - everyone is legend in park (max park rep)"
12831,"Frustratingly bad AI, clumsy controls, unskippable animations, lots of sponsored ads. Not really sure what improvements have been made to this game in quite a long time. Core gameplay is still fun at times, but this is the same game you've been playing for years. Wish another company would step up and make a basketball game. Suggest picking up on sale or skipping...

*Update: After giving it a try for several months, my opinion has actually gotten worse. The bugs in this game are ridiculous, the game will crash to the desktop frequently making you lose your progress. Updating graphics drivers, restarting PC, etc does not fix it. Steam won't give a refund either. This has got to be the first piece of software where I WISH there was error logging so that I could at least know 2K realizes how crappy their game is. Unfortunately, I doubt they know or care."

12834,Best Game I've ever played
12835,"Not as bad as people think if you take out the slot machines. Better than 2k19 believe it or not. 
Still not worth $60 tho"
12836,Fun
12837,"Its a pretty good game if your not playing in the park

12838,"Same game since 2015, but more bugs........

12839,perfect basketball simulation
12840,"just like 2k19, which is just like 2k18, which is just like 2k17, which is identical to 2k5. Play Wii Sports Resort if you want an elite basketball sim, not this shit"
12841,if u about 2k..u should love this game. im about it..r u?
12842,"They have obviously not tried at all on game modes with no micro transactions. I like to play MyLeague, for instance. If a player gets injured, they won't resign with the team because they're not happy with their time on the court. That can happen while they have 2 years on their contract and no amount of starting time will change their mind. Generally players just aren't happy with anything. If you have a player with a 74-75 rating, they'll be upset not to be a starter playing behind the best player in the league. It's super clear to me, that they have invested in trying to get the player to use money in the game and anything that's not driven by micro transactions is pretty much a non-priority. Gameplay is probably still the best NBA experience available, so it's too bad they stopped caring about people who just want to buy a game and play it...."
12843,"4th year NBA has online games, the servers are still laggy, you can t play with your friends, it s always lagging, so if you going to purchace this game for the online, just don t even bother"
12844,It has the 2k17 gameplay animations back
12845,"Not recommend for anybody, the player inertial model still has problem to move appropriately; the long lasting problem of unable to auto-move around your teammate during defense is also still there. I received the game for free and I feels like played by the 2K20, 2k9 was my first 2k nba game and I had the pirated version but it was very good, I even re-purchased 2k9 after 2k10 came out, but games after 2k14 started to have these detail problems from time to time and it's hurting loyal 2k players like me(now I'm even considering just either stop playing 2knba or just get a pirated version so that I don't have to spent the money)
some advice for people who wants to buy 2k20:
1. if you just want to experience the 2k nba game, get 2k19 or even 2k18, use a community created roster to play the current nba roster, this is cheaper and more stable 
2. if you want to play mc, then 2k19 rn is the game to go, cuz 2k20 has longer mc starting story and meaningless dialogues, (I understand the purpose of put a story behind mc player, but can we have an option that directly bring us to the nba team we want to play for and start our career there?)
3. if you are changing from nba live to nba 2k, then I would suggest either get a free copy or a pirated version of the game to get a feel first before committing to the purchase;
4. don't forget that you can get the refund for the game in the first two hours after you made your purchase.

I sincerely hope nba 2k team pays attention to the details of the games as these are the little things that might turn down the skyscraper.

updating after several months:
Still no fix to the moving problem and physical model problem, so my opinion is still: DONT BUY THE GAME"
12846,"oh my god , this is a so hard game. I cannot handle that, I wanna say  goodbye."

12874,"FINAL EDIT: I give up on this game; no matter the settings, I cannot prevent the random crashing in-game. Deleted and money officially wasted

Still the best sports game out there if managing your own league in my opinion.

Everything else is microtransaction, pay to win BS.

Get if you are playing myLeague and wish to have complete control over the going-ons in the NBA.

Avoid for anything resembling pay to win.

EDIT AFTER 18 MORE HOURS: This game crashes- a lot.

12876,"Dear Ronnie 2K, did you know that your PC version of NBA 2K20 is more of a joke than the flat earth theory. I have never seen a more hacker riddled, broken, wast of money and time piece of wet garbage in my entire life. I'd have more fun choking a dead cat than play your joke of a Mycareer. Also, what type of marketing scam are you trying to pull making the game 80$ and FORCING players to spend another 60$ on their Myplayer so that they can actually try and enjoy themselves while playing this unfinished product. I wish I could have spent my 80$ on some Copenhagen dip cause I would have gotten way more amusement out of that than this worthless piece of fecal matter. So to some it up, don't EVER buy this game, not even if its on the store for 0.01$. It only causes more harm than good."
12877,wanna break some ankles? do it here in 2k20
12878,make it open world! and stop adding some random players on my career. still the same connection to servers are still awful but overall its a great basketball game. what can we do it's 2k. LOL! :D
12879,yeah
12880,GOOD
12881,Good story
12882,After the gameplay updated this game is a lot more fun
12883,game crashes all the time
12884,It's a really grindy type of game to get stats up. If you don't want to grind you have to pay money to boost the stats of your character. The game has it's ups and downs like any other game.
12885,"Its fun game play wise, a great game if you decide to stay away from all the simulated gambling aspects."
12886,"Best 2K ive played so far
ive played around 4000 hours across all 2Ks collectively"
12887,GAME SUX
12888,"Alright. I'm a massive basketball fan. I have been a fan of 2k since 2k14, when I was in 6th or 7th grade. This, in my opinion, is a good game core ruined by excessive microtransactions. Yet, at it's core, 2k20 is not a bad game. Unlike 18, which had no defense at all and blowby's were incredibly easy, or 19 where a guy like JJ Reddick could play lockdown D on LeBron, 2k20 actually has  a good balance of defense and offence. The new badge system is great; it allows for more customization and an overall more unique gamestyle to each player. Post play has been nerfed. Centers being able to be rim protectors and outside shooters is rare. There are still issues with myTeam and myCareer, though. The myCarer story is not good. Somehow even worse than 19, imo. Both are stil microtransaction hell, and it is the samer prk as last year. But, by itself, the core gameplay is good.

I primarily play myLeague, which hasn't really changed. MyGM, on the other hand, is completely different. There is no more just cringe inducing dialogue; you have to deal with sponsorships, meet with players, hold a weekly press conference, and manage all aspects of team business and running operations. That being said, the new action points system kinda sucks. You shouldn't need them to play a game. Plus, quarter length is locked at 6 minutes and I believe difficulty is locked at pro. 

Although myGM is completely fucked, I think that the gameplay this year is much better."
12889,good game hoes mad
12890,Basketball
12891,"I am playing mostly My career and I must say: I am having a great time!!! 0 real money spent to make my player good since he levels with a pretty good pace alone (which is a big big plus). Game-play is fun and I like you can create builds like in a true RPG.

 I don't know about the other modes unfortunately :/"
12892,Not a bad game with ass like server
12893,i go hard in the paint
12894,"Surely the best basketball game I have ever played in my life. The story of the career is great and the contents of the game are great too, same as the former NBA2Ks but still making a good work about that. The multiplayer is good but in NBA2K, when time goes far, people are leaving (because of the new NBA2Ks)  and it's sad but still one of the best game I have ever played for sports."
12895,"DON'T BUY THIS GAME, I REPEAT. DON'T. BUY. THIS. GAME. It's pure p2win on my team, matchmaking sucks, there is no way to forfeit, you just have to accept the 30 minutes beatdown every single time."
12896,Very good game i like it
12897,"It's an enjoyable game but has a lot of cheaters when you play online.  Be prepared to see numerous fake legends.  It really is a shame that 2k does nothing to prevent this cheating because over the past four years I have enjoyed playing basketball with this community.  You can still get a few good games in here or there but just be prepared to deal with the cheaters as I mentioned earlier.  All in all, a fun basketball game but cheaters really do bring down the experience.  Just one dudes opinion, take it for what it’s worth."
12898,this game is fucking bullshit like every 2k pleas fire ronnie2k
12899,I've enjoyed the game - would recommend it to people who enjoy MyPlayer features or playing online with friends.
12900,"The engine has improved from last year. For those who enjoy realism modeled on the court, this is the best 2k yet. VC rewards for playing MyCareer (actual NBA games - not park) has improved but the VC facet of the game in general is still trash.

The game is overall better and MyLeague has increased the available tweaks and controls over the league. Park play is better (less laggy so far), but it's not my preferred method as significant input lag is unplayable to me. It's not a light year leap, but for a less than 1 year dev effort and version update, it's as good as any other years' progress. Also, WNBA ftw!

My biggest gripe (paid VC aside) is that what my player can be (skill-wise) e.g. a one of a kind player such as Lebron, Steph, MJ, Giannis is limited because the same character that you use solo is forced to be your multiplayer character. Let park attributes and career attributes be managed separately for balance even through the same character. In real life, there are players who are sharpshooters and elite finishers at the rim. I don't want to be blocked from that in my solo career progression because of park (where the caps actually make sense).

Overall, the core game play is better than ever and the solo MyCareer experience (and fortunately more generic story) is better than any previous year. VC is still VC and park servers are still laggy, granted slightly less. The graphical improvement is more visible this year than any previous and I basically have a NASA computer so I wont bother to comment on PC performance."
12901,better than 2k21 at least
12902,had a better time playing older basketball games seems drawn out and boring the team who created it got lazy id much rather play nbalive2010 or fifa

12905,good
12906,"Besides 2k19, 2k10 was the last 2k I've played and owned. Just bought 2k20 despite the backlash and controversies because it was on sale. I only wanted to do one thing, play MyCareer. That right now at the time of this review is impossible to play due to a glitch in the game that doesn't allow me to play a game without crashing. I really liked 2k19 and I wanted 2k20 to be good, but sadly this will be the last 2k I'll ever buy. I just submitted a refund ticket and hopefully Steam will grant it because I literally can't play the game anymore. The 7hrs I had on record was me playing through the beginning of MyCareer mode. As soon as I got drafted into the Lakers, the first game against the Clippers showed the game breaking bug.

EDIT: I've figured out how to bypass the Sub In Bug and I can now actually play MyCareer. I'm enjoying the game but not as much as 2k19. I'm still going to be grinding in this game for the remainder of the year because this game isn't that bad for what I solely wanted to do."

12919,"It's a good basketball game if its your first time playing the NBA2k franchise.

It's a terrible dissapoinment if its NOT your first time buying an NBA2k game.

Overall, buy if you want the newest rosters + NBA2k19 cause basically nothing has changeed except more ways to spend money."
12920,"I don't know why there is so much hate on this game. Of course games like this one, FIFA, NFL etc will keep producing the same game with some added functionality.  I really don't get how someone can expect completely different game.

I generally buy 2k, every 2-3 years and previous one I had was 2k18. I play this game for ""my career"" mode and I must say, they made it a lot better and realistic than it was before. The interaction between players, cinematics improved, amount of glitches decreased to almost 0. If you just want to play casual and do not have unrealistic expectations, this game is for sure a solid upgrade ."

12934,"Somethings always kinda fucky with 2k these days. I've played a little of all three main gamemodes (myCareer, myTeam, and myLeague) At any point in time I either can't load custom drafts into myLeague, if not the auction house is down, and if that isn't the case I can't open packs. Then when all seems good and merry I lose connection mid game and get an L. Park is just dominated by pay to win sweats bc this is pc. My myCareer player is shit on defense because he has short ass arms. That my fault but I'm still a 6'5"" pg like gimme something. Pick and roll d is so hard bc the center never does what I want him to do. Jumpshots are wack and I have an 88 3pt shot and don't understand why 5% contested shots fall like a third of the time. I've spent like ~$15 dollars on VC to boost myCareer player. Got good value but the game still isn't worth is bc like 5 days of every month the servers just take a break or some shit, and right now I can't see my UI and cant play any sort of game or make a myLeague. I restarted and still have the same problem so I'm hoping for an update because I'm hopefully obsessed with 2k so all I can do is pray y'all don't make the same mistakes.

12948,"At first I loved the game,, was fun to create a character in my career.. play the game and watch as your player goes from bench warmer to starter, to all star, to hall of famer...

BUT

This game is probably one of the most inconsistent game I've ever played..   The shot meter for starters... you can have a wide open player shot a three, with 95 on their 3's and have the bar 95% full and the ball will miss..   

Meanwhile someone with 65 on 3s can shoot with someone on them and drill it..  

The shot meter is kind of useless, anything less then full green is like throwing a dice or flipping a coin.. no matter how open or how covered your guy is.. Especially when it comes to the AI..

Anything above Pro and the CPU will be like Jordan in his prime against a middle school team..   

I won't even get started on myteam.. which is again a massive crap shoot..  It's not really needed to spend money, but you better be ready to grind out players for years.. The auction house is laggy, buggy, and generally unfun to use..   Select a bunch of options then sort through 15 pages of ended auctions..   Finally find the cards which you can bid on...  25 seconds left...  I'll bid... you're bid is not highest... ok... big 20 more times and the auction expires and now all your MT coins are gone.

The contracts are always lame,, I get they want to make money on this full priced game, but jeez,, can't toss people a bone and make those infinite contracts a bit less rare..  I mean we paid 60 dollars for this game and now your taking all our coins on contracts..

Did I mention how buggy and wonky the shot meter ... it's even worse in my team.. as the AI just flat out cheats..   Triple Threat, you're playing against Wilt Chamberlin as a 5 ft' dude who never balled before...  The AI will never miss, your team will play Defense like they have on wet sneakers..   Try to switch around to cover the ballhandler yourself and he'll blaze by you with his super speed.. while your guy has tar on his sneakers no matter how fast he normally he..

I honestly can't recommend this game anymore,,  it's just another cash grab yearly release load of garbage.. I guess we know why Epic games decided to not buy the exclusive rights to this one from 2k..."

12965,I cant play on park every time i am about to start it says a problem has accoured this is game is a waste of money please dont buy it
12966,"Gameplay wise its way better than 2K19. I also like the archetype system better.

The only downside is you can still cheat at the game but product is fine."
12967,"Really good game. Bought it recently and didn't find any  bug . Flawless online. This franchise is so much better than fifa as for example in myteam there is a change among the years evolution cards are a great addition, as well as coach influence. Plus the game is balanced, they try to avoid people playing unrealistically."
12968,"Quickest refund I have ever done. 

You simply cannot put ads in a game you charged $70 AUD for. This is just plain awful and refunding on this alone. What a joke. I attempted to play the game but it was just straight up garbage.

Developer should be ashamed but I'm sure they are making a buttload full of money so they obviously do not care. 

It's like they are putting no money back into the game year after year."
12969,"Game is full of glitches, no in game voice chat. Severs are trash. Match Making isn't that great. PC nba2k is horrible compared to the already shit servers of the ps4/xbox. I got this game for free and enjoy basketball but would never buy this game face value"
12970,kawhi leonard
12971,"This game is so garbage it made me write my first ever steam review. Please Please do not buy this game.

The servers are horrible and if you plan on playing the park prepare for lots of cheaters and paying another 40-60$ just to get a character to play on. (nobody will play with anyone under 80ovr) 

This is literally a scam. Shame on steam for selling this garbage.

Play now works good though :)

"
12972,I am new to this microtransactions situation and I really don't like it
12973,Do not buy this bullshit game. Server sucks unlike 2K19. YOu will literally lost playing online. Do not waste your money here. I am a big fan of 2K. But this 2k20 sucks. Server really sucks.
12974,"ads within loading screens like last year is just an example of the scummy stuff 2k likes to pull in this game series, which sucks because the actually gameplay is fine for single player. These are scummy practices by 2k but it will never change its the the new norm, i come to expect it from this company
EDIT: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT NOW CRASHES WHEN TRYING TO PLAY MYCAREER FIXED ON CONSOLE BUT NOT PC"
12975,There's literally a 30 second unskippable Converse ad at the beginning of games.
12976,"Yes, its full of microtransactions. But I play because I enjoy the grind of MyPlayer and I always have. It seems satisfying to work towards becoming the best player in the game. You don't HAVE to play MyTEAM which is basically the gambling game. Everyone knows MyPlayer is why people play NBA 2K."
12977,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, IN FACT I ADVISE YOU TO BOYCOTT ALL 2K GAMES PRODUCTS AS THEYRE A FUCKING GARBAGE GREEDY COMPANY WHO PRODUCE SHITTY FUCKING VIDEO GAMES TRYING TO LURE YOU TO SPEND MONEY JUST TO RELEASE IT AGAIN NEXT YEAR AND MAKE IT WORSE. I SWEAR TO GOD THEY HAVE A FUCKING SCRIPT FOR THE GAMES AND IT ALWAYS PLAYS OUT THE SAME. 2K20 IS A FUCKING DISGRACE"
12978,It jumped out when I did't want to end while failed to quit when I decided to finish the game.
12979,"This is a great game but, only buy when on sale and have a compatible controller.

Do not buy if you do not have a controller"
12980,"It has some bugs but it's a good game
"
12981,"IDK WHAT TO SAY
"
12982,"less cheaters
"
12983,"The upmost waste of money in the face of the earth. If you don't value your money, your time, your patience, your sanity, buy it.

Overpriced rip off from NBA2K19, hackers, bugs, lags, server crash, timeout, file corruption.

Run away with all your strength. You were warned."
12984,"As someone who only does quick play or NBA today game modes, this game is perfectly fine from what I've experienced. Far shorter load times compared to 2k19 this time last year. Bottom line is if you are a basketball junkie, you really should grab it while its on sale, its not like there is any alternative. It's worth $40, 60 is too much."
12985,worst fucking game ever! Fuck you ronnie you arab nigger
12986,bad dont do it
12987,Non-skippable shoe ads in a full price game. Need I say more?
12988,kobe
12989,"Got banned for life, because uploaded an imagine with ""F"" word. After almost 2.4k hours played didn't get a warning or so. In PC where at least 50% is cheating.... This company is so braindead..."

12991,hello i just bought the game .. and im trying to play the my team mode but whenever i tried playing it crashes
12992,games lit fam
12993,"This $60 game has ads in it, enough said."
12994,"Good game, improved gameplay over 2k19, easy to recommend if you only play single player modes (NBA today, etc.). The same bugs that were in 2k19 MyLeague are present in this game and were never fixed, pick this game up for $20-30

Edit: This game has been broken since November and has not been fixed since. It crashes to the desktop with the latest NVIDIA drivers. If you use drivers from August 2019 and further back, it will work. If you use current drivers, do not buy this game, it will not work on your pc. The game will run for a while and then randomly crash.

Edit: June 2020, still crashing but no where near as much as it was previously. The game frequently crashes in menus, while trying to make trades, looking at free agents, etc. Doesn't crash that often during games, but if it does crash it's usually in the first quarter, then you're fairly safe."
12995,"Dissapointing, just like all sports games recently. No innovation, just a bit of a facelift and thats about it. It's all about the coins now and no effort put into other game modes. God forbid anything will ever be done to mygm or myleague."
12996,"This game too bad.
Too much bugs.
Too many cheating players."
12997,GOOD GAME
12998,better than I expected! but still kinda sucks so many problems playing online

13000,this game is utter filth keeps crashing
13001,"Only bought this game to play multiplayer with more than 2 players.

Played the game for 16 hours and couldn't get into one fucking said game. Was required to ""grind"" before I could even get into the game mode for a character and storyline that I didn't care for.

Absolute dogshit."
13002,"such a bad playing experience. every match is the same, rim running, full whites not going in from 3pt. 2k19 was more fun :)"
13003,shit game
13004,I really like the my career i don't see why this game have such a disappointing reviews.
13005,Good
13006,"If you aim for SP or couch MP expirience it's 9/10. For a true MP expirience better go for console.
"
13007,worst game ever
13008,If you avoid online modes like the plague then the game is pretty fun
13009,"good stuff
"
13010,GREAT GAME
13011,"Worse than every in every aspects, the animations are horrible you don't get much control over the players, and the pacing of the game is slower than ever, not in a realistic way due to the subpar implementation of the animations.

Not to mention the casinos , that stuff is nuff said.

I am so disappointed."
13012,"Absolute trash :)
---------------------------
Quick update - still trash, but for 4 EUR? Yeah, why not, either this or couple bottles of beer."
13013,its decent but 2k deserves a negative review
13014,"First 2k20 is nice Basketball Simulation in career and single player modus. 
But the multiplayer is a disaster, worst i ever see because the Neighbourhood is full of cheaters/hackers destroying game with lags and eye burning animation lags, that only happens by playing with cheaters.
Thats the most enoying part of the game.

POSITIV:
- Fantastik story mode but no variations after playing a while.
- Good my career mode to play alone (best part of the game)
- GFX is good. HD and 4K solution settings are possible. 

NEGATIV:
- moderate basketball move animation and not very smooth animation in motion transitions.
- very CPU intensive stress to system because of bugs and a lot of game crashes. (maybe cheaters action too)
- too much bugs, spezially keybindings, and network. Grafik-bugs, screen-bugs, lot of multiplayer lagging and skipping animation etc.
- keybinding are switching between default settings and own settings from time to time.

Mutiplayer not playable here some examples of a lot others:
- not able to chat or communicate with other players in neighborhood
- VOIP doesnt work properly and cause to game crash often 
- if VOIP works u got probölems in understanding players because of annoying ambiente sound like helicopter.
- forming groups squads cause to game crash very often.
- very often heavy network laggings.
- not able to find matchups in time
- cost to much time finding players of same level to play with.
- no balancing in finding equal players 
- no long time motivation to play.
- unablle skiping Intros/Animation/tvshows and at least after waiten 5 sec to be able to skip it. Annoying and time-consuming waiting espacially in second season after knowing all events/animation/tv-shows
- some bad and wrong implementation of BB Game rules, on fouls and time violations.
And if you know the basketball rules you will fast reconize that a lot of rules are implemented wrong. For example their is no shot clock violation if the ball leaves the shooters hand before times end and of course shot counts. But it does not in this game!!!!

After over 300 hrs playing i have to say ""what a bad game at all"". it makes me angry!
I woulnt buy this game again if i had a choice now. 
I buyed this game to play multiplayer with friends online on free court and all my friends quit playing this game. At the begin we are 11 players - now no one is playing anymore. 
Its such a waste of Time!!!

Lets say it this way -> i want my cash back!!!!
and i cant recommend buying this game."
13015,"This is the most broken game that ever existed. Literally every aspect every detail of this game is in some way broken. Gameplay, game modes, shooting, finishing, dribbling etc. literally everything in this game is broken. They ask for your money on every occasion .If you want to have any progress in this game you got to spent real money and they ask for it all the time constantly. I really wish they would ban this game so maybe finally some other company not 2k would make a serious nba game. This game will only empty your pockets and give you really big nerves because gameplay is so random that will make you wanna throw your controller into screen constantly. I cannot play this game in chill mode becouse there's always something that doesnt make any sense. Like you got a open 3 point shot with a 3point specialist and he misses after that its guaranted that oponent will score in fast break, next posesion you defend he takes contested early red release 3 and it goes in. I litteraly had games where i was 0/5 on open 3 shoting with excelent shooters and oponents whare 5/5 from contested 3s. This system is so broken that i dont want to play this game anymore if i could i would refund the whole thing and forget about it. People please dont spent any money on this game im never buying any 2k game agine, and i didnt even mentioned that from most of games you just gonna get disconected or lagged out and game gonna give you Lose for that !!!"
13016,These motherfuckers actually put unskippable ads in the loading screen
13017,...bad...
13018,i dont have any
13019,lit if u use a slasher
13020,"This game is trolling, the serversd are ass, the grind for badges is wack, shooting is a complete disaster this year, servers (i will say it again) are a tragedy, you cant even play one game with your friend because there is always problem with your connection, they keep adding some shit clkothes, but wont patch two lagged courts 
fire ronnie2k, employ some real devs,
Cheers"
13021,"terrible glitching but after a month 2k support finally fixed it. I love the game but I would not reccomend it due to glitching and crashing, unlessing your like me who is willing to send a total of 35 back and forth emails after paying $100 then do not buy the game. Aside from that the career mode is great and so is the myteam but after playing it for a month unless your a big basketball fan the games gets very boring. Solid 6/10 due to glitching mainly and the limited enjoyability of the game. If your the kind of person who buys games and plays it for a bit and then buys another this game is very fun and is a 8/10 (not including the glitching of course). Good fun with friends though."
13022,same game every year but this year little bit different some badges and some game mechanics idk 100 hours of gameplay and dip thats all folks dont spend money on vc just play 30 hours and dip thats all
13023,broken ass game couldn't even play it without it crashing
13024,"Generally, I like to play MyCareer and the atmospheres pretty decent, but the servers of it are complete BS. Im trying to play Jordan Rec center, but many times that i have gone in, it has disconnected me, resulting in a loss, as well zeros in stats. PATHETIC servers. Cant even play the least ruined part of the game. What a disappointment."
13025,"Unable to play the game with my Nvidia GTX 1050 TI GPU. When I try to launch the game with my main GPU, the game loads 2-3 seconds then stops and gives no visible error. If i play with my integrated graphics its all laggy and unplayable"
13026,"Microtransactions, casinos, pachinko machines, vault prizes, wheel prizes, more microtransactions....and then theres a basketball game included in this Vegas Casino simulator.  I found myself getting a bit dizzy with all the casino style UI.  I have 144 hours on record but thats because I accidentally left the game on pause for a couple days.  

"
13027,"Can't sim to next appearance without 60hz v-sync. Playing that lag with rx5700xt and 144hz monitor...

13028,piece of trash as per usual
13029,TRASH.
13030,"Absolutely atrocious, devs do not care about PC players. Do not buy unless you just want to play offline. Even then don't support this trash company lmao"
13031," why am i  having crashing 
 issues when i play nba2k20"
13032,"Ofc same game as last year, bugs included, Ofc Microtransaction's a pain in the ***, and Ofc unskipabble cancerous cutscene all over again.

But this year, they added a feature where playing against bot in the MyTeam mode, which is the last thing i can endure now with all the cheats and microtransaction sh**, as became boring af. Take a slasher, run the floor, crossover, layup, works everytime. wow. How difficult ?! And that's not all... strategy is shittier than last year, they got rid of some usefull stuff like running the ""corner"" strategy and all that. They implemented the lock positon, whish is a good idea ! but they did it wrong and alot of player can't be swapped on their second position as in real life. I'm not carrying on you got my point, this game is trash. 

I just hope Nba Live will do good someday, so we have a BBall game again cuz this one will have to change a lot before i start to take it in concideration again"
13033,"Why is this game not yet supported by Nvidia Game Ready Drivers? I checked into the support dates of 2k19 and Nvidia had released a version update on the 11th of September 2018, just 2 days after it was released. 2k20 doesn't seem to have an update yet even after almost 2 months of release. I don't want to spam the game with negative reviews since it's clear that Nvidia support seems to be the problem for now."
13034,love my team solo
13035,the fuck is this game supposed to be?
13036,"Waaaaaaaaay better than the previous one.
U gain badges and overall a lot faster.
Gameplay is better.
No probs running the game.
No need to put your money into it, as long as you dont wanna look like a fucking x-mas tree at the park."
13037,"It's a fun game, but it's made by retards. If you don't mind stupid bugs and mind-boggling out of the blue nerfs/changes to the game with absolutely no communications, this game might be for you."
13038,"Most if not all of the negative reviews have to do with IAPs.  
Having played for quite some time now, I can say its a minimal concern if you don't play the card game, which I don't. 
Gameplay is improved over 2K19, graphics are improved, My Neighborhood is much improved, and its an overall better game.
The only thing that irks me is the shortness of the MyCareer mode.  Its a better and better told story but its super short compared to previous versions."
13039,"I really dont know why so many people are hating 2k20, its rlly not even that bad."
13040,This game is trash I borrowed my account to my friend i China then he got banned when he logged on . This game is trash they don’t ban hacker they ban some legit ppl

"
13048,"nba 2k error code 726e613d

With every update the game seems to be less fun.

First when you get drafted you get 1000vc per game after update I can only get 750vc.

2nd update:

Now it won't let me play my career. Game tells me to you must download the update, but the download is stuck at 6%.
"
13049,"So, I bought the game, I played the game, I accepted the grind...for VC. Until today, when 2K decided to halve VC earnings for endorsements. It is outrageous. Two months after release. Every other player who starts to play the game from now on is in disadvantage. I have had enough. I was not going to buy VC and as of today I wow not to buy any other 2K game in the future. 

I can not recommend this game. This game is pay to win/enjoy (after purchasing the game for its initial price). Do not buy."
13050,Hackers
13051,"Honestly, I never played an NBA 2K game before this one, and I like it. The game has provided me with many hours of fun stuff, and I plan to keep playing it for quite a while.

Yes, I agree that it is kind of weird that they made everything just so that you feel frustrated and put you in the situation to buy VC to improve your player. But if you just keep playing and try to have fun, the game is actually not bad at all, I like it.

P.S.: This is my personal opinion, so, please, don't get angry :)."
13052,Game is freezing and crashing and very fun
13053,total disappointment
13054,"I love 2k games. I even enjoyed 2k19 but this is such a shit show its embarrassing. 

I normally only really play single player modes like mycareer and its normally alright but this year they changed it up. In order to unlock mycareer clothing, tattoos, jewelry, dunks, celebrations, etc.  you have to level up by playing against other players. Who 9/10 times are rampantly cheating with nothing you can do. You can't report them, there is literally no anti-cheat engine. its disgusting. 

They also changed the graphics which makes normal players look somewhat better but your myplayer looks blind. I dont know what they did to the eyes but you never look at the right spot and they have just a slight lazy eye. They look like they are made of rubber. Not to mention small issues that still have not been fixed. Legs clipping through shorts, socks clipping through suit pants. Just awful details that could have been easily fixed if anyone cared.  

I actually normally really enjoy nba 2k games but this.. Noone should ever have to pay $60 for this."
13055,EIEI
13056,This game  is ok except for the fact that it keeps crashing my computer every time I open the game and start playing. I've seen that other have been having similar problems. I know it's not a problem on my end because I just bought a brand new gaming pc and everything on it is up to date. Anyone have any solution to the crashing problem? I would not recommend this game until these issues are fixed.
13057,"Shit as always. From the first day with chetos and you try to contact support to ask what tests they need to ban them and they close the chat, come on, they don't care, and we as idiots buying the game again one more year."
13058,Overall gameplay has improved but many mycareer bugs and cant purchase VC
13059,dont buy this game!! many crash...
13060,"I am a massive bball fan.
For years I have played the 2k series since 2K7.
The last 2K I played was 2K15, so I thought... lets give this a try.
...............
.........
......
....
..
.

This has got to be the biggest piece of garbage I have ever seen. I will NEVER purchase 2K again.
Oh man, this confirms to me that sports games are dead.
Games like this make me want to never turn my PC on again... so painful lol"
13061,"New year, same game-breaking bugs. It amazes me that these people still have their jobs after so many people experience random CTDs and blatant exploit abuse. Also, they added gambling this year. Not basketball related gambling. Literally just gambling minigames.

Edit: stills sucks, I just want the steam badge thing so imma repost this"
13062,"Come on people..., the gameplay is the best it's ever been and the graphics are pretty good as well. The only limitation is that it has to play well and look good on this current generation of consoles as most of its sales are on generated from console sales. Seems to me like everyone negatively reviewing this game is just hating on the VC , the over the top online park, and the microtransactions, but just for actually simulating playing the actual game of basketball, it is topnotch! Just look at most if not all of the negative reviews and most all of them speak negatively about the aspects of the game that don’t even pertain to actual basketball gameplay! As a NBA 2K console player for many years now, I am enjoying playing NBA 2K basketball (now with the WNBA) on my laptop and while it can always be improved upon, it is by no means a bad or terrible game. It actually plays quite well considering the recent patches. Seems to me like a lot of people are just jumping on the negative bandwagon because it cost real money to make a fictional player in their likeness play well in the create a player online portion of the game. Personally, I believe not every  personalized created player online should be ranked a 95 or higher overall player right out the gate anyways... (That would be some really unrealistic and crazy gameplay). Anyways, if you play this game to simulate the actual game of basketball and the NBA League it does that job quite well! 

Note: if you play this game on a NVIDIA equipped laptop be sure to dedicate your graphics card to your laptop as the game for some reason will try and use the internal integrated graphics card as a primary graphics card? To do this, right click on the desktop and select NVIDIA Control Panel. Once in the control panel select manage 3D settings and under Global Settings select High Performance NVIDIA Processor, apply and then you will be good to go. Learned this the hard way at first as the game played really slowly on my laptop until I figured this out. Now it plays smoother and better than my console.
"
13063,"It's just another pay to win game. All they care about is how much money you give to them. You cannot even sim to next appearance. Buggy gameplay, total shit show. Not worth it. 

1/10"
13064,"everytime i play a game, mycareer, myteam, play now, right before it starts up, the game closes out. Why does this happen? Someone please help"
13065,"Basketball is great, most realistic in years. People complain about micro-transactions and grind when you don't have to play those modes or buy the coins + this is the least grindy 2k in a while. The negative reviews are very deceiving making people think it is a terrible game when it is actually great, but the circlekjerk hivemind don't like it."
13066,copy paste
13067,"If you're like me and are only really in to playing the MyLeague mode, then I would certainly consider buying this game, as at its core, it is still the best Basketball game on the market and will satisfy your need for building and playing as your favourite franchises. However, if you're expecting an improved experience over 2K19, you will unfortunately be disappointed. The comments about this being a copy/paste of 2K19 are accurate, this game feels identical to the previous installment, save for some minor interface updates. Even with the new Rookies, they haven't included actual photos of them, they're just computer generated faces, so if you're buying this game to get the most recent up to date teams, you may as well just stick with 2K19 and download a rookie/roster update pack, because that is all this game really is, a $60 roster update. It comes across as very lazy.

For that, I've given this game a negative rating. I'm also pretty turned off by the whole casino/gambling thing, but as mentioned, I only play MyLeague, so I thankfully don't have to experience those things.

If you do plan on buying this game, wait until it is on special, because it really isn't worth the price tag at the moment."
13068,"Game is broken.Park is dumb and there is no point playing if you can't spend a 50-100 hours just to perfect your jump shot.Someone who can't play a game whole day and whole night can't do shit.Guy hit a half shot white and got it twice in a row.I shoot normal tree, same white and i can't make it (Same rating for 3pt,yes i checked) + i have more badges than him so there's no point saying ""he hits that beacuse he have more badges"".If you want just to chill out and play some carrer games i recommend,otherwise don't buy it.


EDIT: Now is even worst so don't buy it at all.They don't deserve it.Every fifth player use some hack and i'ts so disg.Developers don't care about game or players.No point buying this,every year is same.This is last ""2K"" game that i bought.Cya."
13069,dooky
13070,"The game is amazing. Last nba i played was 2k14... This one is damn siiiiiiiiiiiiiiick! Animations , cutsenes and MY PLAYER HISTORY!!!!! RECOOOOMMMEEENNNDEEED"
13071,Camera angles still suck. All these updates and they still didn't fix them. I have to abuse the badge system just to make a jump shot as a big even though I'm a shooter/defender. Just like last year all white releases have a poor chance of going in. And devs hate tall and long armed people. Apparently we don't have handles or a jump shot.
13072,"My review is focused only on mycareer mode (I've been playing nba2k since 2012).
This game is way better than nba2k19 in every aspect:
The gameplay is more realistic;
Good skill and badge progression;
The story is better than the others;
Better player moves and animations;
I don't need to buy vc to enjoy playing ( I'm playing on superstar difficulty); 
I really didn't find any issue and I'm very happy with the game.
(To give you an idea of my progression with a point guard: I've played 13 nba games and my player is lvl 74 and  has a season average  of 12 ppg, 8 assists p game, 50.5% FG, B+ team grade and got 6 badges upgrades so far)."
13073,"Absolute crap.
Unplayable.
Nba 2k19 on Ps4 looks and plays better. So buggy"
13074,"fantastic basketball simulator, but horrible game, with microtransactions everywhere, commercials that you cannot skip . last time i am gonna buy from this shitty developer."

its a shame that VC costs that much :("

FUK !UUUUUUUU!"

Edit : somehow the park lag was fixed. now i would recommend the game, but it really blows that they nerfed vc earnings. getting badges is really a grind and vc was pretty easy to get. now its hard to grind badges AND earn vc"
13084,"If you want to play MyTeam and work your way through a well planned out domination gamemode... don't get this game. Half the time you click on the three star option, the game rewards you with two instead, so have fun replaying the exact same game over and over until they feel like you've done enough to earn the rewards you were due from the very start. Shit bug, same shit as last year."
13085,"Amidst the shooting revolution of the NBA charged by teams like the Warriors and the Rockets, 2k destroys shooting mechanics. What a time to be alive.

Edit: I have played over 1,000 more hours of 2k and because of this Steam wants me to revise my review. The shooting I have grown accustom to, in this 2k you will miss many more shots than the previous 20 entries, this can be extremely frustrating. MyCareer is the best it's been in this game, unfortunely, by month 3 the park was overrun by hackers, sitting at 95 overall and with slenderman arms. This is achieved using ""Cheat Engine"", a program I personally haven't used since 2010 when I was hacking Wizard101. Explain to me why this same exploit works in NBA 2K20, a less than a year old triple A title. MyTeam is by far the best gamemode this year, cards like GOAT Kobe, Steph Curry, and Larry Bird add a lot of time-killing grinding, and are likely why I have 1k hours on this game. These cards are outclassed, naturally, by the GOAT cards in packs that you can pay real money for for a chance at them. Packs this year are more expensive than they have ever been, and the odds seem worse than previous entries. MyLeague/GM is a joke, it has been the exact same game mode for 4 years in a row. I genuinely don't think 2k cares about this mode, being that fundamentally, year to year, nothing changes."

13090,"Terrible game. I got it because I myself plays basketball, and wanted just one game where I can sit down and relax while still doing the sport I love. Sadly, it did not turn out this way. My PC has much higher than the recommended specs. On the lowest possible settings, I am getting 30 frames maximum- making the game unplayable. They would not let me get a refund, even though lying about how optimized the game is for PC is false advertising."
13091,me gusta
13092,"Outrage over the games micro-transactions is so out of touch.  I was highly hesitant to buy the game because of how negative the outrage over it is.  End up breaking down and buying because how hyped I am for the upcoming season.  I immediately go into the one mode I stay out of normally which if myteam.  Start playing and after awhile forgot about what I was suppose to be doing, which was finding all this bad micro-transactions.  I was never even tempted to buy VC.  I think the game outright asked me once if I wanted to buy some and then that was it.  After that its just advertisements for the stores and whatnot.  IF you care about competetion during the first few months for esports or whatnot I could see you having an issue.  Past that its just a slightly above average basketball game.  Also, happens to be the only basketball game out right now, so if you wanted to just enjoy a basketball game/simulator then NBA 2K20 is perfectly enjoyable for the price point.

Negative points about the game:  1) the timeout loadtimes - feel like you could work out a way to really decrease loadtimes during timeout.  Rest of loadtimes feel normal.  2) the story mode is pretty weak.  I mean yea its cool to change the world but I kind of don't need my slasher to do that.  Not sure what the story should be but this doesnt really feel like its it."
13093,the grind is too much bro some of us got lives outside ballin
13094,"If you enjoy grindy games and basketball this game is great. People talk a lot of trash because it is pay to ""win"" even though in reality its just pay to progress. You can get everything other people have with time and dedication whether thats a 95 ovr player or a god squad in Myteam. Understand that the first 20 hours or so of the game is going to be grinding and then after that you are going to have to grind another 30 hours to actually be relevant. That sounds like a chore but overall the game is great and fun besides for the occasional disconnect."
13095,"Where to start another year another epic fail in game design and execution, unplayable game bottom line, online lag is to much to swallow, i believe developers are basically overweight nerds that never played real basketball. Dont buy it if you want better product buy cheap key for 2k19 much better game overall."
13096,this should be free to play 4 real

13100,"First of all , Im a huge fan for 2k. i just bought this game for a month since its just been released for a month. the story mode its okay.. but when i first saw the new park of 2k20 , i was disappointed at it.. its totally the same with 2k19. I heard 2k crew said the reason why they didn't change anything in this year's new park its because they want us to feel like home.. The graphic has been improved. Now to the main issue!!! Its similar to 2k19's issue "" HACKERS "" a few days ago i just played against a few hackers!! I'm like "" 2k20 just released just about a month , and there's a lot of hackers already? "" 2k has to find a way to stopped those hackers otherwise its not a fun game to play lol  If they still can't fix this problem , i really don't recommend you guys to buy this year's 2k.. here's an advice , during next year's 2k21 , please wait for the early reviews first before buying 2k lol"
13101,Disappointing
13102,PLEASE TELL GEFORCE TO ADD NBA 2K20 TO THEE APP (GEFORCE NOW)
13103,filled with hackers
13104,every year it gets worse. this will be the last year i buy 2k until i see improvements made via a review. until the first patch whenever i played this game it would say nba 2k19 on the toolbar lol
13105,That is good

13110,this game is still trash
13111,great
13112,"Terrrible game, full of bugs. Frequently have problems and cost me to lose my game after 1 hour of playing, making me have to replay my 12 min per round game. Some daily spin rewards don't work at all. Computer team mates are frequently dumb and makes moves that don't make sense. Don't recommend this game at all. NBA 2k19 is better than 2k20, although not very good too."
13113,"Decent Game if you only want to play quick matches against AI and offline in general. New badge system is nice.

Bad Game: If you want to play online, play multiplayer, play my career...

Due to the lack of competition in the industry 2K has once again ported over the old game with new rosters and some changes that were buggy and probably not play-tested before launch. The game has had multiple large patches that have completely changed the way it is played, and made certain player builds that were good at launch completely useless. Additionally the servers seem to be somehow even worse than last year despite claims that 2K20 had new servers to eliminate the issues from last year.

The game is full of ads for companies that paid to be included in the game not to mention the ads for VC (the in game virtual currency) all over. To make matters worse VC is the only way to increase the abilities of your custom player and any cosmetic item you may want to apply (ie shoes, jerseys, braces, sleeves, etc) can only be acquired by purchasing with VC. Even more offensive is the fact that the equivalent USD amount for many of these items ranges from 10-35 REAL WORLD DOLLARS. (for the price of one historic player jersey you could go to olive garden for lunch with someone)"

13115,pue la merde
13116,i got the game and played it for a while grinding and now my game will not open after restarting redownloading and everything there is no way for it to work
13117,"Best 2K ever, best mycareer mode ever. Much love to 2K for a great PC port, it runs like a dream. There are so many small things in this game that just show that love was put into it. Tiny, insignificant things that make the mycareer mode world seem alive. Thanks Kenny, back over to you."
13118,"this game is BIG trash. DONT BUY!!! DONT BUY!!! DONT BUY!!! 6 days after release cheater/hacker have taken over the courts. so there is no chance to have any fun in park games without using the cheat table. 

2K - i hate you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I will quit this year and never buy again...

2k is a 1 man company. This guy took a new photo for cover and change the numbers from 19 to 20 and game was ready for release."

13120,JOin my pro am team
13121,"This is actually the best 2K I've played. I've played 31 hours and i'm already 82 overall without any microtransactions and loving every minute of it. 

I've got 2K15 through 2K19 on steam and those were ok for the most part, however I have always played on Hall of Fame 12 minute quarters. In those games it felt like my team was absolutely useless, I couldn't hit shots and just became a volume shooter and the movement slow and clunky. Also when they had changed the free throw to a badge and just how you got badges in the previous games was an absolute grind to Hall of Fame badges (or just badges in general were a grind).

However with 2K20 the new skill system is amazing, not hard to ""grind"" them at all because you get a lot of points to unlocking a level in the skills from just playing, in combination with the extra practice sessions its no issue and a huge plus. The movement and speeds of all the characters feels a million times better, you can do stop and go moves, use your quick speeds and you don't have C's catching you down the floor on the break anymore. Loving the story as well, really interesting take on your way to the NBA, with a bonus of great actors to be apart of it. As for the difficulty level, as I said I play Hall of Fame 12 minute quarters and this is the only 2K (2K15, 2K16, 2K17, 2K18, 2K19) that I can actually play Hall of Fame properly without getting utterly frustrated from it seeming like nothing can go right. 

I feel like its got horrible reviews because people look to purchasing microtransactions to be amazing straight out of college, which isn't realistic, and then complain about how aggressive the microtransactions can be. And yes, obviously its pretty microtransaction themed in a way, but at no point have I thought about buying microtransactions in this 2K. In previous I had because I got so frustrated that I couldn't do anything right ingame, so to solve that I had bought them. In this 2K, you can actually play just fine with the VC you make naturally throughout the game.

9/10"
13122,"It's actually a good game. Finally 2k made it into a basketball simulator instead of aracde game for casuals. People cry about not hitting every single 3 pointer, not beeing able to dunk on bigs as a guard and stuff. Like WTF? Have you ever watched/played basketball guys?

Pros:
- You have to hit green if u want to hit 3 pointer which makes the game more real. 
- The MyPlayer creator is awesome. You can finally create all-around player.
- New badges system makes the game more insteresting and flexible.

Cons:
- Potato servers.
- MyTeam turned into FIFA Ultimate Team which is bad.
- That 62 Overall guy who never passes the ball when playing 2v2."
13123,"can't connect to server..can't connect to server...can't connect to server, why don't you gimme an option to play offline, why forcing me to play online, with ultimate server issue? OK  that's it, byebye, never gonna buy your products anymore"

13130,"Ain't that bad. Servers are sh*t, but gameplay itself is great!"
13131,"Gameplay feels better - you earn more vc per game - the grind isn't that big anymore -  they patched the speed gap this morning. With the patch they created a bunch of new bugs, basically we are testing their patches...they just don't deserve a good review for a half newish game, which still has a bunch of bugs and ofc, there are still cheaters running around."
13132,Fun game and very fluid. Makes grinding easy :)
13133,its a fun game ngl
13134,"its, meh. NO online play, servers ass. But singleplayer is fine......"
13135,the game crashes every time i try to get a game going. 'Edit': they fixed the game for like 2 weeks and i was playing normally but now it crashes again as before smh
13136,They literally copy/pasted NBA 2k19 and called it NBA 2k20. Absolutely not worth buying.
13137,waste game
13138,good if you have low expectations and stick to career mode. DONT PLAY PARK.
13139,gr8 smh
13140,better graphics - mycareer is better so is myteam.
13141,single player is good but the multiplayer gambling casino shit is so bad and u have to buy vc for everything in this game worst 2k so far
13142,craZy
13143,good game
13144,"This is not a gameplay review. I'm gonna try to be as brief as possible.I am a LONG time basketball game player, actually since these things exist. I've seen everything. Yet, i've never seen anything like Nba 2k. On one hand you've got a solid base game with an enormous amount of content and potential. The gameplay is actually the most solid it's been in years, even the story in my career is by far the least cringey i've ever seen. The graphics could though really use a new engine, as this one's been showing signs of old age for quite some time.  But on the other hand, you've got a publisher who literally doesn't give a single f$%# about the users. The game is riddled with bugs that have been there for years and haven't gotten addressed, they're still the single most greedy gaming publisher in the world with the pay to play mechanics of the Virtual currency, but THE ABSOLUTELY WORST part of it all....

They will charge you for the VC (if you want to be able to compete at all) BUT at the same time they create an enviroment where literally every other person is using something called a CHEAT ENGINE and it doesn't even matter how developed your character is, or how experienced you are or how smart you are. They will own you. And the fact that 2k doesn't care about that, or hasn't done anything AT ALL over the years to stop this, is by far the most low experience from any company in the industry i have ever experienced. 2k is the worst of the gaming industry that has ever existed. They are hurting the industry, the players, and everything around them, except their bank balance. Now to tell people to stop buying it is not enough, because it won't happen, since there's too many people who LOVE the game of basketball. But TO ABUSE THIS LOVE FOR THE GAME in this kind of manner should be punishable by, i dunno, prison for life if you ask me. I won't tell you to stay away. I will tell you that this kind of practice has to be stopped in its tracks. It's abusive, monopolistic, unethical and just plain disgusting. 
"
13145,"I got a serious question. I plug my controller into my labtop to get a ""better gaming experience"" but I don't even know how to emote in a park game. I bought multiple intros, Multiple flop animations, and a lot of in game emotes. I can't do any of them for some reason. I have to stick with the default one for everyone even though I assign them to each category. I need some help."
13146,"Just a copy of 2k19.

-Game is full of bugs and cheaters.
-A.I. is terrible even on all of fame level.
-Connection is terrible expecially if u are from Europe, most of the time My Park is unplayable with lag and connction issue messages (attempting to reconnect bla bla).  i0ve got 95 in three points shooting, and i can't put a single open shot on my park because the connection lag.

I tried this on Ps4 and works much better, i simply think the PC version is Garbage and devs caould not care less.

Used to be one of my favorite games, but this year is so bad, i would not recommend at all."
13147,"This is my first time i write the comment. 
coz it  is too bad to play right now, so many bugs come up. and the manager mode changed. it was a good mode to play BUT THE 2K20 MANAGER MODE IS S H I T RIGHT NOW. You will not want to play this mode. 
i want to make successful trade to make the team better and make good relationship with players. it is not to have fk with the workers.
and the AI is noobs . in MT ,they did not understand what to do in the game if u don't control them."
13148,"Better and better every year but still with some cons.

Edit number 2. Best game.

EDIT NUMBER 3.
Rec center. Literally worst online thing with randoms in whole universe. Every single random teammate more and more retarded and worse than previous one, every single random stupid teammate dont have pass button or just shooting full contested shots day n night. Literally worst online matchmaking - rec center solo. Brainless teammates every single game. Worst online experience in the world. I just cant imagine worse thing, this rec is new level, literally nightmare hell. Fuck off retards.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzxEzk7lr4U very enjoyable spend of time."
13149,Love this game <3 ! Nice
13150,"Well lets start off with is this game fun? and to that I would say yes it has always been fun, almost every single year, theres no doubting the game has amazing potential. 

Now lets get into the juicy stuff here:

Horrible Moderation: You have some of the most lazy Moderators in the world, working for this company, they simply will give you a macro or ignore you, basically it.

Crazy amount of hackers: Each year no matter what, theres going to be hackers, they do nothing at all about them and infact your most likely more often then not going to get warned or banned yourself for trying to report these hackers, its insane.

Censorship: Almost anything you say bad about the company or moderation staff will be censored near instantly, they don't want future new players or players coming from consoles to learn the terrible secrets that NBA 2K series is completely ruined by the amount of cheating, hacking and exploiting on PC, the moment you point something out like this anywhere else, you will be censored and most likely warned. Sad but true and the funny thing is, they protect the hackers like no tomorrow. 

Overall I would say do not invest money into NBA 2K or any of their PC games, even investing it into console enables them to keep printing the same game each year with zero anti-cheat and the worst support possible, the real only way to make a change is to do what? Protest their horrible services and treatment of customers. 

But everyone can do as they please, take this however you want but this review should be a pretty clear warning that they do not care and will not change. Also you can find many hacking threads and guides on Steam, apparently they're allowed but reporting cheaters and showing evidence on steam, even to have a laugh at the 1,000 foot ""Honey I blew up the kids"" will result in you being censored, warned or banned."
13151,My career's file disappear
13152,"The game is trash still no anti cheat!
bro trust me dont waste your money on this shit!
better spend on toilet paper

but give it a try its worth it"
13153,"no,just no"
13154,Everything sucks. Please bring back the ability to change accessories before a NBA game
13155,"Could be good, but so many bugs and glitches, makes me wonder if they play tested this game. The servers are ass as well, every time you try to play a park game, you get disconnected."
13156,"I've played both the PS4 and PC versions of NBA 2K20, mostly the park, it's a shame how miserable it is on PC. On PS4 you don't have frame drop issues, latency issues that basically boots you offline after playing one game. If you want to enjoy the park, buy yourself a console, it is not worth it to buy this game on PC it is in shambles. I had NBA 2K19 also and it did not have these issues that NBA 2K20 has on PC. DON'T BUY IT NOW! Let the devs know that the PC version is garbage and maybe they'll do something about it! Another thing that I noticed, if one players has a PC that has bad FPS, the other players with good PCs will also be affected by it, I've tried this on 3 different PCs with the same result"
13157,"What a horrible game , it´s actually deppressing , you litteraly cannot make a single open shot unless you get a green , somehow it´s actually worst then 2k19 ..."
13158,"Good game only its boring to farm in nba and in park you get not that much vc
"
13159,This year 2K is trash it's literally a reskin with somehow worse gameplay and lackluster career mode. They haven't made any improvements to MyLeague as well. Very disappointed and I wish I had not preordered this.
13160,This game make no sense. i smashed my keyboard for this damn thing.
13161,Another crap 2k game.
13162,"A fun game turn into trash because of greed and profit, you are stuck watching ads for a game you paid for!

Mycareer  mode is mess, your team mate break open shoots,most time they  wont take shots till the defender gets close to them making them turn over or just out right  miss the shoot. Another big problem i encounter often is when your freaking team mates wont pass you the ball even when you are wide open even after spamming the button to call for the ball.  

On the other hand, the npc team you are playing against, they freaking make  contested shots  with defenders all over them.

The worst is most of the good cosmetics/animations are locked behind  1000+ hours of grind where you need to play online matches, this wouldnt be a problem if there was alot of players , on the pc, i barely see a dozen people when i log in. 


"
13163,"If you play everything ""Offline"" this game is ok. Nothing really new compared to the last 5 NBA2K Titles but solid.
If it comes to online, the game laggs as hell. There is so much Input lag, that you have to release your freethrow at like 50% to green in. I did a lot of research and it seems to be a common problem on the PC version. 

It's just not fun to play online, when you have to play in a completly other way than you play your offline MyPlayer Season games.
Maybe there comes a patch for that, but i dont think so. 25€ is okay for the pc version, but definetly not 60.

Edit: Now, already 3 Months after release, one annoying bug is still in the game: If you play on 140Hz and vertical sync off, you have to alt+tab 3-4 times when your coach sends you to the bench, because the skip-button (A) does not come up directly. On 60Hz and V-Sync on, the game makes no fun for me."
13164,Only good thing in this game is soundtrack
13165,Garbage
13166,Keeps crashing in my career and I lose all progress. waste of 60 dollars
13167,Still not worth it.
13168,"The best game ever
great mycareer plot
great the same mypark
all fine
recommend it
but pleaseee fix this errors"
13169,My career is fun with the storylines And the builds you can put on your player
13170,Best game i've ever downloaded. I 100% recommend it. Cheap and definitely not pay to win (:
13171,"As another review stated ""I question my sanity every time i open this god awful game"""
13172,"I actually enjoy this game.

[EDIT AS OF 30/12/2019]

I think this is it for me and PC 2K. Unless they add an anti-cheat, I just accepted the fact that this game is full of cheaters. The recent sale of 2K20 brought a new wave of new players in which I have no issues with! My only issue with that, is the fact that they bring in more throwaway accounts for cheaters. They just come in from China or just NA itself and they start invading the servers with All-Around Threats at Rookie 1 and Glass-Cleaners that can speed boost with a 39 Handle and 50 post moves. I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS GAME ON PC. I play with a community that is 50% legit players and 50% Cheaters. I've seen more All-Around Threats than ever before it's horrendous. If 2K21 comes out, I'll make sure to get a console version of it. This version has so much potential, we just want an Anti-Cheat system..."
13173,"Better than 2k19, still utter trash. NBA elite players' basketball IQ in this game is lower than a 3-year-old kid, LOL"
13174,honestly this game is pretty solid not as bad as what people perceive it to be. the only problem is that when you're  drafting a player the game crashes
13175,Money sucking machine. Even if this game is on sale for 0.00 and you just love to play my team and have a real life - this game is not for you.
13176,this is the game when you are bored of BR games but still you want to be in challenge!
13177,"After wasting my money on this game for the 5th year in a row im now deciding after this terrible game to never buy another one. i really tried to like it like all the others but this one is just so bad and unfun. please no one by 2k games anymore, feels like the only way it will ever get better. feels bad but nothing has to be better than this. fuck 2k"
13178,"Game is alright, but I disconnect after every single park game. I contacted the 2k support team and they said it was my ISP, I contacted my ISP and they said my internet was dandy on their end. I have NEVER disconnected in any other game like I have in 2k. If they were to fix the connection issues i would consider re-installing this game, but like many other bugs I doubt they'll fix it. over all, 3/10"
13179,"2k19 was a horrible, horrible product. You can see my previous review on that. But this series, Its Good.

Here what I like:
1. It's realistic. This is the most realistic 2K series.
2. Size does matter. You can really tell the stark difference.
3. Shooting is harder than last year, but you can tweak the sliders. 
4. All I can say is, it's the most realistic series ever.

What I don't like
1. Well the GM series is still the same like last year. But I'm happy with this year game play. 
2. Wished there is more you can added.


"
13180,Whats wrong with your servers?? i keep on disconnecting on MYCAREER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

edit: kyle kuzma 0 min pls. trash
edit: just hog the ball all the way, teammate is just trash, ad and lebron open mid range miss?!?!?"
13183,"Gameplay generally has improved.
BUT they have fucking butchered MyGM, I understand its not the most popular game mode; but for the core fans of the game mode it has been a very good experience in the past few years. I'm pretty sure the boys who play this game mode don't give a FUCK what random kids are doing in their own MyGM, and just want to build their own experience; so what fucking retard devs decided to butcher this game mode, into some online garbage leaderboard comparison garbage which literally noone could give any fucks about, and then to make it better, make it the only game mode in the game which you can't change game lengths; when its the game mode which is most about delivering the most authentic and realistic NBA experience, all the stats in the game are fucked with like 63-60 International/WBNA-type scores. What about its new garbage UI, where you literally have no idea why you have just advanced 4 weeks and all your games have been simulated. No more custom drafts, no fucking anything, all because some fucking clowns thought that I wanted to compare my MyGM to fucking corey from Azerbaijan's MyGM. No work will likely be done to rescue this game mode because 2K cant generate money from this game mode, and its clearly the only thing they give a fuck about now and this is where 2K just becomes FIFA, you hate to see it.
Its all chill tho, because I can still hit the quan in MyPark and go to Ladbrooks or Coral in MyTeam."
13184,"as the only triple a basketball game we got on PC, its not bad. but zero anti cheat and same cheating methods for years, you wont enjoy playing legit often on park. 

Stick to single player modes, or get a good team to roll with seriously. 


soundtrack was trash





edit: 7/14/20 

0 anti cheat makes the game pretty unplayable, you're bound to get a cheater on your team even if you dodge them. Since they hack legend and kick your teammates off the court and 2k wont let you back out fast enough to leave."
13185,Online sucks balls. Crashes every second. We spent hours to play just one game.

13190,"fk this shit its a sucks. Always crashes when I launch a game. Non stop.
"
13191,"Horrible game. Most inconsistent launch of any triple A title video game I've ever seen... There has been so many game changing patches since the game came out, you really wonder if you're playing a demo or beta. 

Examples:
For some reason now there is a better chance of shooting an early shot and it going in, then shooting a slightly early just off the green window.
No matter what 2K promises the servers will never be good, because if 2K can manage to save any money for in exchange for in game performance, you'll be safe to bet a billion dollars that they will surrender customer experience for MONEY.
Shot contest is a joke. You can contest a shot / layup and be given 'good shot contest' only for the shot to go in. 

Don't buy the game now. Wait until next year. The game will be much more polished ( hopefully ) and you will have a better experience compared to buying it right now. 

In totality, 2K is so out of touch with their community and game. Simple bugs and glitches aren't even noticed by the dev team, but are noticed within the first 20 minutes of launch by the community. They released another un-finished product per usual.


"
13192,"As another review stated ""I question my sanity every time i open this god awful game""

So another year and another 2K... Its still again one of the few and only NBA games, but at the end of the day its mostly another copy-paste with updated rosters and slightly better graphics. This time in any mode your best player will get double teamed no matter what during every play its been like this for weeks and still hasn't been fixed.



"
13193,"As a player of  my carrer its not as greedy as it was, earning VC is easier the gameplay is one of the best within the last three games, The badages are real great, the AI is pretty fine. Give the game a try. (On a discount)"
13194,same game from last year
13195,"Review I've written when I had 70 hours in this game (editing when I had 375 hours):
I think I've played enough of this game to write a review, so there it is:

Pros:
[b]+[/b] I really like the MyCareer's prelude;
[b]+[/b] I love MyPlayer creator: you can now choose which badges you want and same for attributes;
[b]+[/b] I really like a lot of things NBA added to MyTeam:
     ""+ Evolution cards;
     ""+ better awards for playing triple threat (mainly offline);
     ""+ harder domination (if you compare it for example to last year);
     ""+ better rewards for collecting cards;
     ""+ better auction house;
[b]+[/b] I like the change of neighborhood, when there is an event around (excluding Court Conqueror, because it didn't change much);
[b]+[/b] I love it that you can now see when an opponent shoots (% of being contested), etc.
[b]+[/b] I really like the change of wheel of fortune - what I mean is for example: if you get a free NBA Store item, you can now just go to the shop and choose for example any shorts you want, not just random.
[b]+[/b] I love that 2K returned to the Reputation system in MyCareer, which was a really successful (imo) in 2K17, but...

[Cons]:
[b]-[/b] ...because of it nobody wants to play with you if you don't have minimum All-Star MyRep level. I was grinding my player to become 90 ovr, but because I'm Pro 1, nobody wants to play with me, which is ridiculous and just sad that 99% of players just look at your reputation.
[b]-[/b] [spoiler]Game feels slower;[/spoiler] Edit: they changed gameplay a little bit - in a positive way;
[b]-[/b] Defense changed so much if you compare to last year and unfortunately - in a negative way;
[b]-[/b] Absolutely nothing changed in MyLeague...
[b]-[/b] ...and on the other hand new MyGM sucks
[b]-[/b] [spoiler]At the beginning, I liked the concept of this game: more greens and if there is full white - you'll probably miss it. It was a good idea, but I think 2K should just a give a little higher percentage of making full whites;[/spoiler]
[b]Edit:[/b] Now there is a bigger chance of hitting full whites, because of few bugs that they've repaired (https://twitter.com/Beluba/status/1178719919946338306);
[b]-[/b] My favourite mode: MyTeam... As I've written in last year's review - the most irritating thing in the world right now is an error: ""A problem has been encountered that prevents gameplay from continuing. This game will not be counted"". And what I mean by that is: (just like last year) you can play in Unlimited and win by for example 10 points and there is like 20 seconds left. An opponent can somehow MAKE THIS BUG HAPPEN, because they don't want to lose. That makes me so fucking angry, when you are winning and something like this pops up. It was happening last year, but you know what? I thought when this year arrived I was like, it'll be a fun game - well not today motherfucker: In my first Unlimited EVER on NBA 2K20 - I shot a buzzer beater to end the 3rd quarter to have a 11 point lead and then what happened? ""bla bla bla bla bla. This game will not be counted"". It's just fucking dumb; 
[b]Edit:[/b] Actually it's not a massive problem as it was... I mean - in 10 Unlimited games you may get 1 game, in which someone hacks, which is still sad, but...what you gonna do? 2K didn't resolve this problem since 2k15, so yeah...
[b]-[/b] servers are trash [spoiler]- sometimes you can't do a team practice, because there is an error, so you have to restart the game, to join mycareer;[/spoiler]
[b]Edit:[/b] So this problem is not in the game anymore, but still servers are trash...
[b]-[/b] even if you play a game in mypark - you either have a lag and then you get an error or everything freezes except you and you can't even see what ""the real"" score is - even more play a game OR you just drop to 20 fps, so you have to restart the game;

And just on a record - I'm not one of the dumb people, who writes a negative review saying it's pay2win, which is a total bullshit, because you can have more VC and better MyPlayer overall, since NBA 2K17. Is it really hard to grind MyCareer to get minimum 2,000 vc per match and 10,000 vc for endorsments? I don't think so.

If you are a huge fan of the NBA this game is for you, but only when it's going to be on sale...like a bigger sale, because what's the point of grinding MyCareer when no one wants to play with you (unless if you have a friend you can play with), same as MyTeam.

Also this game is better than NBA 2K19.

[b]Edit:[/b]
[b]-[/b] 2K releases players from the token market in a different collections... for example: Lou Hudson, Mark Price, Bob Love, Isiah Thomas."
13196,the number of times this game has crashed at the end of a 48 min my career game where i lose all my stats and upgrade pts... i spend $400 on vc and this is how im rewarded.
13197,skrrrrrrrrrrrr skrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
13198,I have played nba2k games since 2k9 and this is literally the worst one ive ever played....im talking worse than 2k18.
13199,"I have a pretty strong pc not to brag but to let you guys know that i have frame dropps in park, rec and 3v3 proam. only playable in my career and 5v5 proam. as i said i have a rig that can handle any new game coming out for the next few years without a sweat. i have 200 MB/s fiber optics. but they answer is that it's still me. i have tried new graphics drivers and old, it just doesnt work. other than that the obvious cheaters. 

P.S: i have rtx 2070  i googled and tried all the tweaks that you can do to it... it's just poorly optimised."
13200,"So as this is the first basketball game for me in a while this is pretty meh. My biggest issue with the game is the fact that they included microtransactions into every aspect of the game, especially leveling up your character stats required credits that can only be obtained in game or through paying out of pocket."
13201,shit SA servers
13202,This mechanism is so awful!!!
13203,"My biggest gripe with this iteration: You MyCareer Player can now only be good at one thing. So you you cannot really become a great NBA player. Example: You`re great at post offence, but that means you can only be mediocre in Rebounds, Defense, Driving, Passing, etc. It makes no sense. You can't aspire to be a player like Jokic, Durant, Lebron, who a great at more than one aspect of the game. This was a porlbem last year and they doubled down on it this year. You're supposed to create more than one player, I guess (thus more opportunity for microtransactions). 

And another thing that has plagued the series for a while now: Unskippable animations/cut-scenes before the game, during time-outs, etc. I feel like every 2 minutes someone is taking the controller away from me, saying: You gotta watch this 10 second Gatorade commercial before you can continue playing. 


TLDR: eSports aspirations and microntransaction greed are runing this game."
13204,"This review is based on the my career story mod only

Everything in the game improved , except for the servers they are still slow. 
other than that everything is fun and there are some bugs there and there but hopefully they will change. 

overall if your a NBA sim fan then that's a win for us, the game is much more realistic than ever before and i like it so much this way
if your a more of an Arcade type of gamer then you wont like it
"
13205,"Full of hackers who just exit you out of a game when u enter menu and hack all the cards,just pirate the game if u want gameplay.2k wont do shit to ban them on pc so its hacker land!"
13206,"Got clapped in the park by a 7'7 99 Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, Steph Curry kind of dude, 10/10 would get clapped again."
13207,"This game used to crash and restart my PC 100% of the time in exhibition games. Never even been able to play past the 1st quarter! 

No other PC games crash my PC? 

Guessing my video settings were too high for this program to handle even though gameplay was smooth with no lag. Put it on 4K medium, and anti-aliasing to 1 and finally made it past the 4th quarter. Looks good in 4K and game play is super smooth.  

Hope EA works out those kinks that keep crashing peoples computers before releasing NBA2K21. Please get more testing and validation staff to test PC and console varieties and work those problems out from the get go........

13219,no
13220,"2nd Update:  Game crashes at the end of 2nd season in my league consistently.  Can not get to third season.  This game has been a nightmare.  I almost had it where I could thread enough needles to have fun with this game, but every time I get there, something happens to break it.  It shouldn't be this hard to enjoy a video game.


Update:  The game can work with a CPU vs. CPU my league but it has to be done differently.  You have to control every team, but change every team except the one you want to control to auto everything in the management area.  This will enable you to view games other teams play.  It's not ideal, but it is a workaround that works easily enough.  

Original Review: 
Broken for CPU vs. CPU sim players

Tried to play other games in a myleague and let the CPU vs CPU go and while the option appears to be available as you can check the games, and the option has indeed been there for at least a decade, it appears to not work this year.  While I know we are a small portion of the people who play the game, it's impressive that they actually decided either to purposely remove that feature or be so buggy a game that they accidentally removed it.  Maybe this game will be worth it after they fix, but for CPU vs CPU players in my league, this game is currently a non starter."
13221,overall a good game
13222,"Dope game you can sink midcourt 3s but you ll brick a free throw if you don't have atleast 70 ft rating and you don't green it, centers can screen you out of existence like imagine playing a 6ft3 sg and steven adams comes and rapes your ass into the crowd (which btw have a nice animation for you falling onto them), or picture danny green (skilled player but still has alot to learn) getting buckets from limitless range like harden and curry but with a 85 overall.
Gr8 game would definetly play again, bugging through the floor is a feature.

13224,"incredible how sh*t a game can be, u can have fun but its pay to win game with braindead developers

honestly i want to die...
like wtf is this shit, 0 fkn logic in it

After 120 hours i reached chronic depression, i cant eat or sleep, sometimes i wake up in the middle of the night and think of just how shit 2k is, i dont know what kind of retards work there but jeez fuk me dude

13228,"Servers are too rubbish, all kinds of connection errors, this generation of unlocking and dyeing hair is the most basic thing to force the play of parks, parks are also all kinds of hanging gods, the game experience is very poor, servers are often not connected, can only play fast games, this generation of things are the previous generation, there is no new experience, On the contrary, there are more and more bugs. It's too bad. I swear I won't buy 2k21 anymore. 2K is a fraudulent subsidiary company. I hope some warriors will sue 2K company for fraudulent consumers and let 2K company go bankrupt."
13229,"Cancerous microtransactions, similar to mobile games. You know how in Youtube, you can't skip ads for 5 seconds? in every match, there's an unskippable (for 5 seconds) Gatorade commercial everytime your team takes a timeout. I do not recommend this game to anyone. Please stop supporting these kinds of developers."
13230,underrated
13231,There is no mycareer offline. Im very disappointed with this game.
13232,SO SLOW
13233,"As a game its not NEARLY as bad or pay to win as people say it is, though there are a decent amount of glitches in the animations as ive literally seen the ball teleport once and sometimes contesting a shot will look like it worked but really didnt, its still an improvement from 19 and the whole slot machine issue is vastly blown out of proportion"

Final Review: VC/VC"
13236,"In the sea of negative reviews, I wamt to write a more positive one. 
I played NBA 2K seince 2013, and constancly see the change of the gameplay, animation, UI , and more. 
The thing is, I'm talking from a perspective of ""My career"" Only.  I've barely seen other sides of the game, because I only focus on this one. Can't say too many bad things about it... The opposite is true, there is an improvement in player movement and animation. Maybe I'm the only one who think that way, but at least in ""MyCareer"" there are not bad changes from the previous game.

In Conclusion: If you play solely in ""MyCareer"" you will not have a problem, you will enjoy it."
13237,"No anti-cheat system, you can't even report cheaters."
13238,"The game is built for competition and not for fun. I wish they would separate my career from online so i could build a super player and unlock all the rewards. Fortunately i found a way to make this game fun

Edit:Honestly, this game has got a lot better than last year, but then again the only bad side is the REP. I dont play multi player but REP will force you to play online to unlock certain animation and upgrades"
13239,"You are forced to play multiplayer if you want the full single player experience. You have to gather ""REP"" if you want to have all the nice animations to be used in MyCareer (single player mode). Gathering Virtual Currency is slow and no matter how good you play to the draft night you will always start with OVR60. You are a ""solid first round pick"" and still the worst rookie in the whole game. Prepare to spend more money for micro payments. 
The true game price isn't the price you pay for this game.

I recommend EA Sports basketball game."
13240,piece of shit server 2001 cheapserver lagging 4 no reason
13241,The game keeps crashing at random points. Its also not even optimized for PC. DONT BUY FOR FULL PRICE lmao plz dont

13244,"A poor port from the console version. If you play over 60 fps you cant sim to next apearance in the Mycareer mode.

$ h itty laggy servers that will kick you out of the game after a neighborhood match. Terrible coding that causes the game to freeze at times on a 2080 rtx with 16 gigs of ram and a i9 processor. 

Its better to waste dev resources on making the wnba roster instead of fixing our piece of shit buggy game
 
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME OR ANY 2K GAME,  $H I T COMPANY WITH PREDATORY BEHAVIOUR"
13245,"Well Hi,

2k20 is the last edition il buy. we had great times since 2k14 but its over.

Changing each year the gameplay aspects such as game speed, badges and other gameplay aspects, makes it boring to adjust every year to some of the changes. I dont mind the grinding but based on the conrtol and pace ive come to know and sometimes like from 2k series.

Its a great game to play for  1 year and thats it.

Best Regards

13246,"TRASH :)

Worst game I've ever played. Full of bugs. You can't start a game with friends because every second the game carshed. Don't buy. A waste of money. Give my money back!!! give me my moneyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"
13248,I don't know why I bought this game
13249,"Game devs should go seek a career in another field, as they are extremely useless. Game is very slow, full of glitches and does dumb stuff to often for it to be excusable, definitely wouldnt recommend to anyone else. The game is beyond rigged, dont listen to what difficulty the level is on, as this is definitely not the case. Need to win the last game for a special reward, well have fun because the opposing team starts moving at lightning speed any time that you develop any sort of lead. Utter waste of money."
13250,"Pros:
-attribute upgrades cost less than in previous versions
-new introduction that allows player to boost initial salary (combine draft and university games are cool)
-new moves appear, so now you can just easy to stop while driving and make open shot
-player building process enhances. It gives you more flexibility to build player you want. After you finish building your player, you can test it in a single game before you proceed to my career.  Builder also gives you a hint who's similar to your player. That makes you capable of creating player similar to any real player you like.
-capability of choosing badges you need/like etc... That's pretty cool that devs give us opportunity to select badges we want/need and upgrade them to any level including to Hall Of Fame.
-myteam doesn't require multiplayer game winning  to open Auctions.

Cons:
-controls have changed. So, need time to adapt.
-major bugs on the initial release date, though they have been fixed in the later patch (patch works fine at least for me)"

13278,"Is it worth $60? Not sure. I don't play online, the online is trash and even worse on the PC version. 

The single-player gameplay is fantastic, though. Easily the best basketball simulation so far, one of the best sports simulations as well. The game feels less hyper and unrealistically quick as previous games, all in the name of realism. Graphics seem slightly better than 2K19, and the animations are much better. You can customize all of the animations from previous 2ks, as well as new things, such as dribble/running style. A lot of subtle jumpshot and dribble animations were added, making the game feel much more realistic. I enjoy the new MyCareer system, except for the awfully long grind. In-game, it's pretty enjoyable as a campaign experience. As a person who likes the single-player, simulation aspect of 2K, and occasionally creating custom characters to insert into the NBA, this is easily the best 2k yet.

The online is less than worthless. Only people playing it are blatant cheaters, 99 ovr everything, morbidly obese kids who can't get out of their mobility scooter in real life so they have to pretend to be good at a basketball video game instead. Buy a PS4 if you want a decent online experience."
13279,Its ok i guess
13280,"Game is good, can't believe it has so many negative reviews haha. The irony is that this isn't so much of a review I guess, just some tips from what I've seen so far...

1) It's much easier to get badges you actually want now. Just make sure you do some research before you make your build - 2klabs website is good for this, or even some youtube videos. Be especially careful if you have VC that came with the game or you have bought because it really sucks to waste it on a bad character that you will end up ditching.
Personally I just bought the base game and anything I have now is just from grinding. If you are used to playing certain MMO's then I doubt you will find this especially taxing.

2) Set it to 12 minute quarters, hall of fame difficulty - this is good for grinding badges, which are FAR more important than they may appear at first. You will lack some VC to upgrade your attributes (progression) but they will improve over time anyway. Focus on whatever your main skill is. I play a Centre (glass cleaner) so I have been focusing on upgrading my defensive attributes & most important badges in the team workouts (which are worth doing if you have the time).

3) Slashers aren't that great so don't just focus on dunking!

4) The game seems much more fluid. There is an extra setting in the coaching controls menu, and the auto play calling seems quite a bit better because of it.

5) Gatorade boosting after every 3 (?) games is finished. You only have to do it once a week for all categories (strength, stamina, etc). It also seems a lot easier to get fans now for the endorsements, and the way that the +/- is attributed in game has changed. You no longer lose rating for both a turnover *and* turnover leading to score for example. Play carefully & it's quite easy to get a good rating, you don't even need to get that many points per game.

6) The my neighbourhood areas seem much more full. Maybe they changed the way servers are populated because there are actually quite a lot of people playing in the parks compared to last year.

7) Make sure you use some of your VC to buy shoes & clothes. Running about in the default clothes just isn't fun for long!

8) Try to run up a lead and get A+ rating ASAP. If you can get a big enough lead then the coach will set you for large portions of the game - which speeds the grind up considerably. Also the intro loading screens are now mostly skippable so it's quite fast compared to 2k19 to actually get into a MyCareer game.

9) Make sure you pick the right team for your MyCareer player. There are lists/youtube videos regarding this but it is quite important. For example there would be no point in me (as a centre) joining a team that has a lot of dunkers, as I would get fewer rebounds per game - which would lead to slower badge progress. The name of the game is efficiency!

If you stick to MyCareer & the park, and don't get into the awful gambling parts of the game then you will probably enjoy it. It is certainly an improvement on 2k19."
13281,The gameplay is clearly improved and the game is harder than earlier versions. The whining about micro transactions only matter on the silly card game....
13282,"I don`t know why people are hating. This games MYCAREER is sick. I didn`t play NBA2K19, so from NBA2K18 to 2K20 it is pretty good. Also I don`t see what people wanna see change massively, Fifa and WWE don`t change to much.
Stop hating lol"
13283,this is stinky poop but i will still play it sadly.
13284,"Wasted opportunity.

I didn't want to write a review, but I feel like between the trolls and the good reviews there's a lack of details about why this game is as bad as it is. I'm not at all surprised about the micro-transactions, lets be real, this is 2k they're not going to slow down on that. I do understand that it's tough to make an annual sports title that actually has new content and I'm happy to say that 2k, for the most part, has actually done some great work with some of the new features. However, MOST of these are implemented in the wrong way, and/or broken. 

The progression system is really good, it allows you to actually choose which attributes you want to upgrade. That was one of my biggest issues with 2k19 and before. Instead of hoping to get your next ball handling/3 pt attribute upgrade, you're allowed to upgrade any of them to your cap right off the bat, that's really great. Here come the issues...

The shooting, it is soooo inconsistent. I have made shooting builds and miss open 3s and 2s CONSISTENTLY. So basically the only way to make shots is to get a green release, which for most of the people playing this game casually, myself included, its not fun to shoot because you have to concentrate so hard to make your shots. And this is offline too... Not even in the park. This means that it doesn't really matter how you build your character unless you know your jumpshot or have badges, which kind of removes the point of attributes in the first place. 

Next is badges. You basically are a 10 OVR if you have no badges. If you have an 80 3pt and no badges, you shouldn't even attempt a 3 because you're most likely gonna miss. ON PRO!!! On top of that it takes for ever to get a badge upgrade point. I'm a 90 OVR with 5 playmaking badges and it takes me 6-8 games on 12 minute quarters to get 1 badge, which is basically upgrading 1 badge to bronze, unless you have more, then you can respec, make some HOF, gold, silver, etc. It really sucks this way because, why should I even upgrade my 3pt in the first place if I can't shoot without HOF range extender, deadeye, steady shooter, difficult shots, quickdraw. I just don't know what they were thinking.

This game ultimately isn't rewarding, getting yourself open for looks only to miss on a full white isn't my idea of fun, it's more frustrating than I ever thought it would be. 

In the end, I cannot recommend the 2k series from this point on unless they address these issues. Hopefully micro-transactions go away in a couple more 2k's and maybe soon we'll actually be able to make an NBA superstar, but until then, save your money, it's really not worth 80$."
13285,worst of the worst award winner *clap* *clap* *clap*
13286,"Okay, this is very very similar to 2K19 and still LITTERED with microtransactions for the MyCareer mode. Same EXACT neighborhood, don't buy this until it's 20 or less on sale. Not to mention they added ZERO new features to any mode that doesn't have micro-transactions. The EXACT same create-a-player features, they on the sly RAISED the prices of the vc too. Pass this one up boys."
13287,"this is a fun game, but the creators of this game do not put an anti-cheat for this game, its BS of how they cant put an anti cheat while everyone is trying to regularly get better for their player, im a streamer (UncleJonJon) and its stupid why they cant put one on"
13288,"Waste of money. First of all, it's the same game as it was last year. 2k was too lazy to even change menu. 2k20 is a bag of bugs. You can get fouls without any contact with other player, some of your wins can be not counted and so on. Also why the f.. my team players release are different when you play offline and online? It's a shame to ask for this game 50 euros. You have to be realy greedy to do so. WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!"
13289,my nba 2k20 keep quitting by itself help me please
13290,Don't believe the review bombing geeks from Reddit. Game is good.
13291,"Stupid game and far too many bugs in this game. I played MyTeam online mode for 20 minutes and when I almost win the game, it said there is an error occur and the match doesn't count. What a stupid game."
13292,"good game they patch every bug in less then 12 hours stop cry its worth af really good game yall just haters
"
13293,"DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF U A TRYHARD PERSON AND USE CHEAT JUST FOR DOMINATING THE GAME AND EASILY RAGE WHEN THERE IS A GLITCH 

BUT 

BUY IT if u fine with the grinding and play for fun.. 

In My Opinion people who ABSOLUTE hate the game are the tryharder person and getting really serious with the Park Game...for me this game is better than the other basketball game, althought yep u can call this game 2k19.5 :D but im good with the game. 

SO
IF U DON'T LIKE THIS GAME THEN DON'T BUY IT AND GO BUY NBA LIVE :P WHICH IS ""BETTER"" (MAYBE)
PEACE..."
13294,"MyPlayer is really buggy when you are playing, timeouts the game goes into slow motion and waiting to be subbed in takaes forever because the game doesnt allow you to immediately simulate the game. Very buggy."
13295,What a joke.
13296,Greatest 2k ever
13297,"welcome to nba2k20!
where everything is copied from nba2k19
where you are non existant on defense
where your offense is trash because you are 60-70overall
where bugs n glitches happen
where its p2w
where its shit servers
where your name disappears

what can i say, this is the best game that has ever been made... copied... 10/10 :)"
13298,"great game






kappa"
13299,"Always when I win on MyPark I get ""2k Online services error"". Is it worth to buy VC for Player upgrade ? 
I cannot get out of Rookie 1 level, because of damn 2k server crashes.... F$$K YOU"
13300,lag refund
13301,"Okay. I'll make this quick.

1. Crashes. Wack.

2. Microtransactions. Wack.

3. Loading screen wait times. Wack.

4. The game LITERALLY PICKS AND CHOOSES WHICH GAMES I CAN CONTROL MY PLAYER IN! SOME GAMES, I CAN MOVE AROUND AND SCORE. SOME GAMES, I HAVE TO SIMULATE BECAUSE MY PLAYER WILL NOT MOVE, PASS, SET SCREENS.... NOTHING. WAAAAAACCCCCKKKKKK!

5.There's no way EVERYONE is outrunning my 87 SPD MyPlayer. Absolutely not. Wack.

6. I got stuck in the Kemba Walker playground before the scene ever started. Just standing there next to Kemba. Wack.

That is All."
13302,fucking fuck
13303,awww shieet... here we go again
13304,"This community is incredibly negative. Of course the game has its cons, of course money spenders will always have the upper-hand and of course the game is buggy, but it is fun. It is indeed fun to play with friends and it is the best basketball game in the market. It is super grindy, but at least you get that sense of accomplishment when you grind out HoF badges. Buy the game because it is arguably better than previous 2k versions, don't buy if you hate grinding. Also wait for a sale or buy the game from a key store. Buy vc for 10€ and enjoy the gameplay."
13305,"Literally unplayable on 144hz, with GTX 1060 and i7. Why would they put that as a option if it's unplayable? Getting a refund."
13306,Trash
13307,pretty good game. it plays well. I like all the modes. my only problem is that 2k needs to push for better pc support and player base. story mode is great.  I was really involved in myplayer story. the card collecting mode is fun.
13308,very good game
13309,"Had a hope for this game, maybe this year as special celebration edition game will be done right. Sadly no, even after patches this game is unplayable. Just had one of the best My Career game and after the game when my player went for interview game just crashed, turn on the game again, and I'm in a start of the same game that I just finished. Progress of this game is just not worth playing, badges and vc is hard to earn, which looks more like casino game - ""More real money, more fun"". All I can say is my decision of buying this game was bad, all I want now is #Refund..."
13310,anthony bennett mvp 2020
13311,"Better than 2K19, typical micro transactions but its really expected with 2K. Better paced game play and MyCareer."
13312,"People act like you need to drop money, to have a good Experience with MyCareer or Online, you dont.
Gameplay this Year is really good, and i did not encounter any Gamebreaking bugs."
13313,Nope.
13314,Loading screen takes a century. VC is way too much for the fact that it barely makes your my player playable
13315,What a rubbish! Combined with bugs.
13316,"trash, A.I team mates barely pass the ball, make terrible decisions both offensively & defensively. I don't rage at this game but seeing the questionable decisions by your team mates and just the game mechanics itself utterly ruins the experience. Btw, the worst idea 2K ever had besides their glorious VC is adding quick draw. I shouldn't have to grind copious amounts of time just to get the badge to HOF which is the only badge level that shoots relatively reasonable (still way too slow). Ronnie2k should be fired, I should be able to get my money back but because I was a dummy I played more than what I should of. Do not buy this product, stay clear and only get it if it's on sale for like ten dollars maximum, absolute trash game."
13317,get my money back! ! no changes but still stupid ai. my fxxking idiot teammates in MC
13318,"sucks game

i can't even save the mycareer progress everytime i played mycareer, and went to story, when iquit, i look back into my save and my save is missing/gone

I WANT TO REFUND THIS FUCKING GAME !!!"
13319,"As long as they don't break MyLeague, which is still not broken, always positive.

Little scary though that the thing about MyCareer/MyPlayer being broken in perpetuity has spread to MyGM breaking which means next year I bet MyLeague will be broken, then ded is ded. 

Everyone who plays MyCareer, just stop buying the damn game, I don't wanna hear people tell me the reviews of this game sucks because of thousands of whiners that hate on a game mode I don't even fuck with. Go buy a PS4 and get NBA Live."
13320,"The game play itself is fine, but the fucking thing is full of game breaking bugs. My My PLayer simply cant sub into games. When i push A to enter the game the games starts moving in slow motion and it takes 25 min to sub in the game, and then the game crashes, EVERY TIME. Dont waste your money. Its a shame because the game itself is pretty fun."
13321,Awsome Game
13322,"Completely bullshit. Every time when you try playing individual battle with the opposite, you just stopped and cannot dribble and move once you touch the opposite players or the opposite players touch you, what's that stupid setting? Does that mean I never can make a driving lay-up? Have you ever seen Lebron or Antetokounmppo played basketball? Most of their scores are finished by speeding up and knocking others down if someone tryna stop them then with a slam dunk as an ending, but in this game, you never can do any similar actions or ways to score. Cause you are just forced to stop each time you bump anyone, what the hell is this shit! Stupid company with dumb programmers, fxxk you all!"
13323,waste of money.. worst game ever !!!!!!!
13324,Such a money grab game can't even play solo games without long grind or micro... If someone read this don't do the same mistake and avoid this game at all cost.
13325,"I don't think a buggier game exists. I've crashed 5 times in 15 hours of playing. The most recent crash completely wiped my MyCareer save I'd spent all those 14 hours and long waiting to even play the game I was excited for. I had hope, but now I don't think a worse game exists. The strategies are the same across every team (Center and power next to paint, shooting guard and small forward in the corners, and point guard top of the 3 point line) and everyone is guarded from the 3 point line or even half court. Who guards montrezl harrel from anywhere but the paint? Why do the centers, specifically gobert and ad, stand anywhere but the paint on defense? I could let it slide if they were defending a guard or a center who could shoot, but no nba player would even think of guarding boban from three. Oh wait, 2k says everyone guards the guy who is so bad at shooting he doesn't even try from 3.....



Also, it's 99% the same as 2k19. The overalls changed, very few faces got an update, the teams are updated for now, and there's a new story for MyCareer. Everything else is the exact same as 2k19."
13326,"- 1  Playing PG in my Career and be as slow as Center and being forced to do the Gym once a week to get faster. That's with pure speed build.
- 1  Impossible to Guard certain point guards in My-Career NBA games . Small fast one are pretty much impossible to guard . When you do what real NBA games do and lead them to the Center , the Center isn't there most of the time.
- 1 AI getting fast breaks ever single time down the floor in My-Career.
- 1 Game is trying to break my control hitting A to skip everything like timeouts , stupid replays that i have turned off , changing camera to crowd etc.
- 1 When you are on the bench right before half time or the end of the game , you will watch the  ""action"" and can't skip.
- 1 Super Ai cheese
- 1 Myteam being in the game.
- 5 for sliders not being in MyCareer Nba Games. 
- 1 Same game as last couple years and I'm not talking graphics.
- 1 My'Career when the AI literally sits in the paint and no call. Or when they are holding you the whole game. I could literally just start playing with low character and they will hold on to me.
- 1 Literally no improvements to My-League offline.
-  5 No Yearly Rosters for 60's,70's , etc  for my-league. So if i wanted to play in the year 1980's and have full rosters  in My-league i could. I have thought they would have done this years ago but nope. 
- 1 For making me waste my time writing negative review.
+ 1 for doing your job of doing the roster. Because that's literally all you do. All the need game-play mechanics and shit is just sliders . All you care about is mediocre my-career,  kid parks and my-team for money from idiots.
- 1 Left out Coach Mode again.

- 21  out of 10 GJ. 
"
13327,it's so trash
13328,Yet another year that the release version is unplayable due to bugs
13329,"This game wasn't ready to be released. Most, if not all of the commentating is reused from previous 2K. Lots of bugs even after all the patches. Game startup where it would just not respond and freeze your pc. After the first drill in the team practice, it would also freeze for no reason. 2K won't allow Nvidia live streaming for some reason, game would just close itself."
13330,"Game is trash. Only runs at 50% filled out a ticket a week ago havent heard anything back. 2k20 is trash avoid buying it this year, save yourself from a 2k that was released with so much wrong with it."
13331,Dont buy this game.... i didnt believe any of the review down here but right now I realize how bad this game is. So many bugs not optimzation is bad. 千万别买这垃圾。。
13332,"Now cheaters are 99%, will not buy 2k again

although there are tons of bugs, the new movement engine is great, but one thing i cant stand is that RT running feels like skating...."
13333,That's my first review on Steam ever. Sim to next appearance still not fixed. It's so annoying. As a NBA player I cannot afford new shoes or tattoo. How ridiculous is that. This need to be changed.
13334,"Great fucking game. People are crying for some reason, just buy it and grind it. People don't appreciate the grind!



Yeet!"
13335,"Simply disgraceful. It is as 2K is putting a strong effort into getting this series poorer and poorer every release. 
My career mode is constantly slaughtered, main character history gets shallower to the point where not even PA says your name anymore. 2k18's DJ is the last character whose story was able to kept me engaged and give the my career mode a reason to be played. Now my career is dead and it's just another way to have you buying VC: no more main character's friends, no season running personal history or anything like that, just an (extremely) short intro and sponsor contract signing scenes where they haven't even bothered recording the whole script (that you get to read by yourself...).
It's frankly embarrassing no other game company is stepping up to replace 2k series."
13336,"How to solve system error? ""It says  that a filee of 2k20 is locked by and cant be updated. Please close this program and Try again.""
Thank you."
13337,"A much more polished game play over 2k19. Foot work has improved dramatically and timing on jump shots isnt super quick anymore which is great. The face scan feature has also come a long way from when it was first introduced and now looks somewhat decent. Gone seem to be the days of mouths for cheeks.
Ive run into some technical issues like massively long hangs in between gameplay and cutscenes and vice versa. 
The no names on jerseys in mycareer seems to be a huge oversight on 2k's half.
This game is good. Its better then 2k19 minorly but in a lot of areas. Im hoping updates fix this but with how long this company has been making these games, you might think they shouldnt need updates and patches to fix some of the problems they seem to be having at launch. Might be worth producing games once every two years instead of every year to really develop the game and give it time to grow. I know msot people would be willing to pay top dollar for a genuinely great product. It just doesnt seem to be that anymore."
13338,Broken features early on in mycareer.
13339,"Why so bed, men? Ikea, pls, refund."
13340,Don't need to review much.. basketball? 11/10
13341,"i get hangs in playground some kind of error kicking me out all the time. Waste of money? for sure.
Also i got the EU version not the US waste of money again"
13342,"I purchased 2K19 and first time playing the game on PC (other than PS3 versions) and LOVED IT despite the backlash from loyal users who complained about the game. Fast forward to 2K20, what a pile of shit. Deleted the game only logging 11 hours of gameplay. If you call it gameplay. Then find out the tards released an update."
13343,anyone for play with me and my friend we search group for playing pro am im pg and my friend pf
13344,"It's a fun game but it's literally just 2k19 with updated rosters. I enjoyed it at first until I encountered several bugs that made it unplayable. I understand the developers had a due date they had to release the game by but I was really hoping they'd actually improve the graphics, the game modes and the game itself to be more enjoyable. Initially it's a waste of money at the moment. Hopefully next year they start from scratch and use a newer, smoother engine."
13345,"Slow slow grind. Total cash grab as always with like two new dunk animations, a couple new players from the draft, but 3000000000 different ways to gamble your vc (real money because you couldn't be bothered grinding for years for it), in the park, rec, etc.

2k also give youtubers like ChrisSmoove 500k vc so they can instantly upgrade their players and enjoy it from the get go. But not you  and me. We're stuck with a crumby 55 OVR who can barely stand nevermind dunk, shoot, run, walk, breathe, exist etc....

Don't bother. It's always tempted me in but it is just a total cash grab. Don't."
13346,fuck ea
13347,"Got my MyCareer save file corrupted and apparently 2K only offers a one time courtesy restoration, even when they admit that there's a problem with game files corrupting at the early parts of the game, so if your game file corrupts more than one time there's no way to get your charcter back. 2K is a scam company."
13348,very very bad
13349,do not spend your money on this unfinished game no crossplay parks are empty lag outs no updates like x1 an ps4 safe your money
13350,best  basketball game ever
13351,"It's extremely clear that this game is some kind of mobile game. Where you pay money in order to skip tedious gameplay.

You make about 5K vc every hour from playing my career games. You need about 250K to get your player to some proper overall. That's 50 hours of ""play"", unfortunately about 30% of playtime is loading screens and cutscenes. 

And grinding badges is even worse. 
You choose one player, you grind it for 200 hours. Wanna try another player? Well, good luck, that's another 200 hours.

The game is designed around the concept of having A TON of tedious tasks (mainly pressing A to skip). This is also present in MyGM. The players then pay to skip through the BS. That's the heart of the game basically.

Servers are still trash btw.

"
13352,game is crashing all the time
13353,"There's a basketball game hidden in this Casino simulator, so that's a plus."
13354,"The design of this game is exciting, but too many details make people angry and I feel bad.！！！！！！！！！
AI in MC mode is very dumb，Often strange change of position。
Even the worst opponent can be very accurate.
Feling very bad, feeling badly messed up。
In the MC mode, the thunder team was placed fourth, but the system replaced Adams with a 75-point player. This kind of behavior made me feel bad and I couldn't understand it.
It's very simple to play against the weak team, but it's very difficult to play against the strong team. The difficulty difference is too big.

13380,"NBA2k will always be one of my all time favorite games. I buy the game almost every year it comes out, having said that here is a quick review of how Quick Play Online, one of my favorite modes:

Quick Play Online: pretty much broke
- most of the games encounter a problem that doesn't allow it to finish (and not counted on your record). I have a very good Internet connection and network seems fine, but netcode or whatever on NBA2k side seems terrible. After all these years, errors like these still have not been fixed. It's not a new error on PC and game play issues surrounding online vs. have been there for years. 
- still after all these years, no microphone supported game chat against opponents on PC
- why am i still buying this game? because i love basketball and this game, but... it's getting a bit silly.
- i remember when 2k was light years ahead of nba live. Nowadays, I wish nba live would come back to PC, so 2k would actually have to fix their broken game. Or anything? Maybe CD Project Red can make a basketball game.
- i'm happy to review other aspects of the game, but by far quick play online is my favorite (and almost unplayable)."
13381,They made MyCareer super redundant to prevent you from refunding the game.
13382,Task bar still says '2k19'
13383,There is a few issues with it but overall a pretty fun game and to be honest you dont need to spend any money on it if your willing to actually play the game :/
13384,"This was on my wish list as a game i was looking forward to playing. I have not played a basketball sim since the old Live days (well when Live was actually good). But I had held off getting it because I read about all the bugs, glitches and such. Even though I knew I was taking a chance I broke down and bought it today anyway. What a mistake!! All I had for the whole 25 minutes I tried to play was a black screen with sound. I could not tab out or get to the task manager or any of the tricks to get back to the desktop. I tried multiple times. My rig can more then handle this game so I decided that this buggy mess is not for me and i cashed out. I might as well use that reference for this buggy casino sim. Refund is on the way."
13385,"Full of bugs, cheats, glitchs, crashes, 90% same as nba2k19. It's a joke"
13386,"Fuck this game, this game have a toxic community with trash talkers and hackers. If you didn't play 2k ever before, i would not buy it if i was you."
13387,Exactly what you would expect from 2K Sports.  I loved the career mode.
13388,Can this Studio close already?
13389,it's bad. update: still bad.
13390,"ANÁLISE/ REVIEW 

EXPERIÊNCIA TERRÍVEL!

O modo Mycareer é o único modo que jogo, e o menos caça níquel também.
Entretanto, se você optar por evoluir o seu personagem com as partidas será uma decepção.

Os personagens ou são rápidos ou são grandes, eu simplesmente não consigo jogar de SF, PF ou C pela velocidade deprimente deles.

Seu jogador respira e a stamina despenca, existem algumas badges que diminuem isto então eu preciso deixar de colocar em uma badge interessante da minha gameplay para investir numa badge pra não dropar stamina, um absurdo total! O jogo ainda te pune por não acompanhar as jogadas que claramente são impossíveis de fazer antes do 99.

A atualização nerfou tanto meu playmaker que eu precisei evoluir mais 10 pontos pra ficar parecido como estava antes, que decepção. Se você quiser jogar como slasher, vai se estressar, as infiltrações estão ridiculamente difíceis, te obrigando a jogar como shooter.

Infelizmente eu gosto muito de basquete, senão passava fora dessa bomba, quem gosta pouco é melhor nem comprar. Com a 2k sem concorrência essa bomba vai continuar a se perpetuar por todos os anos.

Eu nunca fiz uma análise negativa de algum jogo antes, mas esse eu me senti na obrigação de vir aqui e fazer isso.


TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE

Mycareer mode is the only mode I play, and the least pay to play as well.
However, if you choose to evolve your character with matches it will be a disappointment.

The characters are either fast or big, I just can't play SF, PF or C for their depressing speed.

Your player breathes and stamina drops, there are some badges that slow this down so I need to stop putting in an interesting badge of my gameplay to invest in a badge to not drop stamina, total nonsense! The game still punishes you for not following moves that are clearly impossible to do before 99.

The patch nerfed my playmaker so much that I needed to evolve 10 more points to look like it was before, what a disappointment. If you want to play as a slasher, you'll get stressed, the infiltrations are ridiculously difficult, forcing you to play as a shooter.

Unfortunately I like basketball very much, otherwise it was out of this bomb, who likes little is better not even buy. With 2k without competition this bomb will continue to perpetuate for years to come.

I have never done a negative review of any game before, but this one I felt compelled to come here and do it."
13391,the game broke at the start nice 2k very nice
13392,game trash
13393,Sick of bricking wide open shots with Klay Thompson. Trash game.
13394,SPRICH DEUTSCH DU HURENSOHN
13395,"Exact same hackers as last year. If you go online everyone got 99 with all badges and 60 overall, trashgame"
13396,This game is excellent. On a high power pc gameplay is super smooth.
13397,You try every year the game thinking it will be different but nah its just a copy of nba2k19 and its even worse the servers are impossible and even with my rtx 2080ti i feel lag like what the hell is this? Just gave up never buying any game from 2k again.
13398,this game gets more unplayable with every year
13399,"The good:

- graphics
- optimization
- presentation
- movements

The bad:

- game is a big pile of buggy mes!
- it runs good only on a 60 hz monitors
- it freezes often ofr a few seconds

Still waiting for fixes to recommend this buggy mess!

Avoid it as far as you can!"
13400,this is the worst in the series in a long time
13401,Come on NBA2K20 why cant we play Triple Threat on MyTeam. Keeps coming up a ERROR like WTF Fix this already!!!!
13402,"Loving the game so far. If you're a basketball fan, you would enjoy it! Except for missing name on MyCareer, sudden lag etc. The gameplay too is good. Maybe don't mind the overwhelmingly negative review because some will still put a thousand hours on this game.

So far 7/10."
13403,"The gameplay itself is really good, but be prepared for an extreme grind if you do not want to spend extra money.

It´s the most realistic version of the 2k series, worth it if you are okay with the grind. If you intend to play offline, it is always worth it but when it becomes cheaper.

If you are an online player but do not have the time to grind do not even bother."
13404,"needs optimization, needs better gameplay, needs better economy, needs to stop taking up all my free time"
13405,"how to fix the mycareer game i can get one court if i got one court 2 min no longer all game u need to wait !   


!!!!!!!!!!  help plz thank you   !!!!!!!!!!"
13406,bug game
13407,"The whole AI. mechanism is broken. They run directionless, opponent just usually gets an easy pass + layup. Plus, AI. decision is joke, they use center to jack up 3. And they force you to defense mismatch and not that the opponent switch defense or anything.
P.S. Mostly, I play my career with AI. due to bad sever."
13408,Why is there basketball in my casino?
13409,"Pretty good game, story line is well developed, mechanics are greate, overall playable and enjoyable experience 8/10"
13410,"Unbelievably and badly bugged. Hackers rampant. Game crashes completely at random, removing earned progress and forcing you to replay games. If it weren't for playing Neighborhood with my friends I honestly wouldn't play this at all; it's so astoundingly lazy. 2K clearly does not care about the PC experience. It's laggy as all hell, simple functions are buried in menus that change depending on where you're standing, and every aspect of the design is built around forcing you to spend at least an extra $50 to get past your character being a complete doofus for the first 15-20 hours of the grind.

DO NOT BUY unless you're fine with just kind of accepting that it's a good game buried under several bad ones, and if you don't mind having to do repeat standout performances in games you've already played (for instance, break the NBA 3-pt record, play for 40 minutes, barely win game on buzzer beater, then crash and lose every ounce of it).

2K should honestly be ashamed. These issues have existed on every 2k PC title to date, and the only reason they get away with it is because there's just no competing basketball title and they know people will get forced to buy it anyway."
13411,2k20 suck suck suck seem as 2k19
13412,"This will be the last 2k for me, alot of bugs that they won't bother to fix, all they care about is money"
13413,VERY LAGGY; DOESNT WORK
13414,shit ita so bad im stuck on the email promtps waste of money dont buy i thaught that i should buy even when i saw people say dont buy listen to them PLEASe
13415,"I expected way too much of this game... full of glitches. The ""sim to next appearance"" simply just wont work. 
Way too bad."
13416,This game is perfect
13417,"recycled trash 

same as last year"
13418,"The game is lagging and the video in my laptop become green screen, when i play nba2k19 my setting is ultra but in this game even low is lagging. Please fix this"
13419,cant even play myplayer because the game crashes every damn time the first cut szene starts. gj 2k!
13420,"An even more broken version of 2k19..
Only thing 2K is capable of is making the most money out of their game.
At least they pretend that its an good game in 2KTV (trigger warning) 

Rather watch NBA than playing this pile of crap

Edit: IM SO VERY FUCKING HAPPY WNBA IS IN THIS GAME

Edit.Edit: My Carrer is pretty fucked up, but what they have done to My League is madness

Edit.Edit.Edit:Off and On Ball Physics get worse the more u play

Edit.Edit.Edit.Edit: Cant play the Game because its stuck in Update screen??"
13421,jebal kas pa hujnu
13422,"its 2019 and its still a pay to win game i need to say no more, follow fortnites steps to become a real game"
13423,"These devs are fucking clowns! EA please bring back LIVE so at least these clowns will put some effort in making this game at least playable. Bugged asf, a lot of microtransactions, they totally ruined MyGM and made some totally useless changes just to change something, like the positional playcalling that now is really slow and uselless to do etc. The players now moves like they have some physical problems, unless if you go to the rim and you get some bugged animations that will make you teleport to the rim to dunk ignoring the defense, also players get tired real quick, i get that they can't run full time in a game, but for god sake they're athletes, they doesn't get tired after defending for 5 seconds irl. Anyway do not buy this game, if you really wants to play a basketball game buy some olds 2K and download updated roster. Just don't buy this trash."
13424,The game is unplayable. Always lagging
13425,"2K FIX YOUR FUCKING GAME, WHY DO I GIVE IN TO THIS SHIT ITS PEOPLE LIKE ME THAT MAKE THESE GAMES WHAT THEY ARE, A STEAMING PILE OF SHIT, SO AGAIN FIX YOUR FUCKING BROKEN ASS GAME 2K ITS SO FRUSTRATING THAT A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR COMPANY JUST SHITS OUT THIS ON A YEARLY BASIS AND RELEASE IT SO FUCKING BROKEN



after playing for another 100 hours after i first made the review my conclusion is the same do not buy this unless its £5 or less"
13426,i really like this game this game is awesome
13427,"Not much to say that has not been said. I got a refund and will miss this year after 6 years straight of playing this franchise.

2K does not care about PC players or its core users."
13428,"First off, let me get this out: HAHAHA

There. 

To release a game in this state and call this an AAA-title and charge AAA price for this should be illegal. In its current state, there is too many bugs to even recommend this. 

Luckily for me, I don't play the online portion which is the buggiest now. The ""single-player"" MyCareer mode has at least been playable for me so far.

Even with all this mess sorted out, maybe I could recommend the game, but still there is the underlaying issue of the horrendous microtransactions. The fact that you must pay 50$ extra just to be able to compete in the online MyPark mode is absurd."
13429,everytime I try to play mycareer and sim to next appearance my game goes into slow motion and takes forever to sim
13430,"#FIXNBA2K20

2k has 10 billion of dollars and their servers are worser than africa internet


Sad."
13431,"Bro I have always knew nba 2k series are full of bugs. But this is literally the worst I have ever played.
No name shown when playing mycareer, cant change the fucking quater-length in myGM, cant subs in or subs out player in myGM as well. Hopefully we can get a full update asap and I really want the use-create roster too.
2k Please take it serious I dont want to buy a unfinished game with such a high price and just feeling disappointed every fucking time."
13432,Best basketball game since 2k9
13433,Fix the game you pocket plundering assholes
13434,If youve played 2K before dont buy it and if you want to start playing 2K buy 2K19 for 10€/$ on a keysite.
13435,"MC mode is shit. This game is a disaster, so disappointing. Is there any way I can have this refund ?"
13436,"Shooting without Badges is ass, dribbling not necessary at all. Beside the absolute worst performace i've seen in a game! Still aight to play if you're not mad about freezes etc."
13437,"Worst game i ever played so far, cant play because of loading wait, play 1 hour and wait 1 hour in total, no chance to grind my player because story mode gets to slow motion when im on substitution, cant fix it. plis help?"
13438,"Same trash every year.
Still buying o.O 
tell me why we waste our money"
13439,"Lot of negative reviews talking about pay to win and microtransactions etc. I've never once spent extra money on any 2K game. I don't know what people are expecting. I'm incredibly pleased with this years game. The degree of customization is incredible for each character. You can make exactly the kind of player you want and focus on badges and stats you'll actually use. I'm about 30 hours in already and I'm completely pleased.

If you're interested in this, don't let the negative reviews distract you. You can't expect to come out of college and be a 95 rated over all player who instantly starts in the NBA. You need to work for what you get - put in the minutes, the drills, the effort. MyCareer is much more like a Basketball RPG now and I love it."
13440,money evaporation simulator
13441,its a new dlc for nba 2k19 which cost 60$
13442,"I bought this game to gamble all my real hard earned money away, and what do I find? Some basketball. What great mind at 2K decided to put basketball in my gambling game? Outrageous, will not buy again. 0/10."
13443,The only one Basketball game now. Really good NBA video game！
13444,"你们的身体接触就是一坨屎！！！
your body touch is a piece of shit!!!"
13445,"The game play is actually quite good this year.

Unfortunately there is a glitch in MyTeam where an online game crashes and neither player is awarded a win or a loss. This is occurring 3/4 games for not just myself but a friend. Both of us have cable connections. Unfortunately without online stability this game is unplayable for me."
13446,Pretty frustrating. You get to the NBA and apparently can't shoot and run like a turtle. I would hope they will improve it but for 60 bucks plus they basically make it so frustrating to play you feel like you need to spend money on VC to improve your player. This video game generation sucks. Is 60 bucks not enough? Garbage.
13447,"Multiple crashes, constantly not recognizing controller, an hour played and maybe 6 minutes of gameplay, this game is shit, the playability is shit, im so dissapointed, I'm not even playing a game.... its worse than EA.. jesus christ

Worse sports game ive ever played"
13448,Man isn't awesome to be able to gamble in a Basketball game. I know I love it 10/10 ;)
13449,"i mean, the only problem i'm facing is that i cant play triple threat offline."
13450,"Despite copying and pasting large chunks of the game from years past, NBA2K have somehow managed to create a game more broken than any 2K game ever. This game, I kid you not, is unplayable in every single platform right now. That is as disappointing as it is impressive.


And yes, AD is ridiculously ugly and you have to stare at his face for a few seconds every time you launch the game.



Do not buy this game. 

"
13451,"Where to start,

The gameplay is the best it's ever been and it's a shame because everything else has become a shitshow."
13452,Nice facepack DLC
13453,"- Runs very slow on even decent computers
- servers are powered run by hamsters and drop out every minute due to tiredness
- full of microtransactions and the story is as boring as plank of wood  
Somehow even 2k19 is better than this, would recommend playing the old versions over this.

Still plenty of bugs, blue screens my computer when i try to play it."
13454,2K14 with updated roster
13455,"Warning! Do NOT buy this game!
It is impossible to enjoy at this moment with looooong loading screens and you have to wait like 5 minutes every time you hit ""simulate till next appearance"" on my career games.  
Plus it has all the usual microtransactions that 2k is know for, and a freaking casino."
13456,"Do not buy this unfinished alpha of a game from probably the most incompetent and uncaring AAA developer at the moment
✅Neighbourhood crashes on average once every 2 minutes for me, sometimes nearly instantly crashing after I've rejoined my friends' neighbourhood
✅Nearly impossible to play rec with friends as one is guaranteed to lag out/crash at one of the 4+ glitch stages you need to pass before actually getting into the game, and the possibility of lagging out mid-game still exists. I've probably spent 5x more time alt+f4-ing and re-joining than actually in rec games if not more
✅The servers are as bad as ever, which is hilarious for it to be this bad at release
✅Player Progression was completely broken for 2 days
✅Needing to restart my whole PC about 3-4 times every hour while trying to play rec because of the crashes
✅Single player triple threat is still down despite being down at launch 4 days ago
✅Devs flat out lying multiple times during development on things that simply don't exist and probably never will such as being able to re-spec myplayers, which would've been huge for saving time and money/vc on making new builds
✅The WORST game for pushing micro-transactions/gambling - probably costs about £40-50 to fully upgrade one character which is made worse now that we cannot re-spec players.
✅Despicable advertising and encouragement of gambling in MyTeam in a game that children can and will play. Why hasn't this been more restricted by law worldwide yet?
✅They seem to have made some small improvements to gameplay but that is completely neglected by game modes being completely broken, glitched an unplayable
There is/was probably heaps more issues i cant think of rn.

Seriously, did 2k not fucking play-test this literal pile of digital human excrement of a game. It's been out 4 days and half the game breaking issues have not been fixed or even acknowledged by 2K. I cant tell if its more incompetence or just 2K don't care and I'm not sure which would be worse.

Do not buy, the only reason I did was to play with friends who were all getting it before i move countries and you can barely even do that right now."
13457,"New year, another cash cow. That game is a pure copy of NBA2k19 with some ""features"" to justify the AAA price tag (either way not even a good one cause of all the game breaking bugs). Its clear now that this game just wants to tear your wallet into pieces with all those microtransactions.

Stay away from it. I already regret buying this piece of trash."
13458,"Ugh.  All the negatives of 2K19 amplified and you have 2K20.  Gameplay is severely lacking...feels like there are way too many locked animations that take place.  Playcalling is still horrible... :/  Passing still sucks.  MyCareer teammate AI is even worse than before. Unskippable ads are completely unacceptable.

There are a few improvements:  You can now choose a body type for created players.  You now choose your own badges for MyCareer toons.  Purchased clothing and tattoos are shared across all created players.  MyTeam is pretty fun this time around.

I've noticed that now there are ads that you cannot skip that play before a MyCareer game."
13459,Dopeeeeee !
13460,"Game is just a copy of NBA 2K19. Down to the task bar icon still saying NBA 2K19 for the newest version. My career story line is un-creative & over dramatized, ultimately it ISN'T the players choice. Game is monetized to the millionth degree. Unless you buy Virtual Currency in the game you get destroyed. Game is built to bleed real life money from online players instead of offering a pleasurable experience to a single player campaign or story line.

I left a bad review for 2k19 and no one listened, this game is exactly the same, why would I pay for the exact same game. Im so disappointed I don't ever want to play NBA 2k again and i'm a life long fan since 2000. Make a game that delivers enjoyment not monetization. THIS IS NOT A MOBILE APP STOP TRYING TO MAKE MONEY OFF PEOPLE AFTER A RETAIL PURCHASE.

I've refunded my purchase of the legendary edition. Will not buy 2k20 until the 1-10 dollar sale day in a year. Thats all your over-hyped story line and roster update is worth anymore."
13461,"Cons: 
-Can't shoot with my 3-level scorer with 95 mid rage and 95 three point
-Can't dribble and lose the ball alot with a slashing playmaker
- Badges take my whole life to get one
- Can't pass to save a life
-Everyone can out run my 87 speed
-I lose mypoints for getting a 3 star in practice
-Can't skip to me coming in game without is slowing down for a minute then letting me play
-None of the builds feel like they matter
-microtransactions
-Lost my name
-Servers

Pros:
-The community is coming together against this garbage

-#fireronnie"
13462,This game is shit
13463,shit 2k
13464,"It costs a lot for a game that relies so heavily on microtransactions. 
If the game was going to do this, the game should be free."
13465,If you are gonna get this game at least get it on console
13466,"So I've read some of the reviews here and I don't really gat what y'll complaining about. If you are not a die-hard player playing this game 24/7 just in MyCarrer to get to that 99 OVR, this game is comletly fine. I've played 2K since 2K14 and spent 600+ hours on each one of them. The game is good every year and it is also better every year. Sure the servers were always a problem of 2K, but they will figure it out eventually. They always do. 
Trust me... If you want to have fun playing this game, you will. Just ignore microtransactions and it'll be just fine. Can't wait to spend another 600+ hours on the game this years.
Thanks 2K"
13467,"Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty good basketball game.
BUT, this is the same game as idk let's say 2K17. Like literally nothing is different in gameplay. And the MyCAREER mode is still quite bad, nothing has topped the Spike Lee 2K16 story.

Just don't buy...."
13468,"Good innovations were made to this game that were removed in the first update. Each update makes the gameplay feel more like the previous games. 

Removed ability to load a draft class or even edit a players number in MyGM mode. It costs points to play games. Its now a simulator mode. 

This is easily the worst 2k in ten years and the only I would not recommend buying."
13469,"I was so hyped for this.. Unfortunately it is not just bad, it is horrible. 
This is something to expect from a free to play game or developed from some small company. 
Anw it is 2k19 with some tiny changes, which this fact alone marks this as do not buy. Plus this year they introduced some game breaking bugs) YAY!! Because paying for the same game again is not enough, you have to play and right before you win tadah!! disconnected. You wanted to play some mycareer game and you got benched. Well don't you dare to press the simulation, spoiler it will crash the game. So just to win one game you have to play hours praying that it won't crash this time.

Sad.

UPDATE 1: New feature introduced to the game-> error code c3854bcc
UPDATE 2: Apparently matchmaking in MyTeam is at its best and thankfully no exploiters exist :*"
13470,Tons of bugs…and one question: why there is always a dead ball 3 seconds before half time? Is that even a basketball game?
13471,This game crash every 5 min what kind of shit game is this 2k19 at least wont crash.!!!
13472,Fire Ronnie
13473,"It's a pile of shit, trash server for 4 entire years.FUCK you 2K"
13474,man i hate this game wish a passion  they took away expantion teams in my gm and custom teams in my gm and you can be talking to hire new staff and it freezes and you have to restart it and wont be able to hire that person you have to end the conversation this happen in 2019 to and the roster isnt right they got guys that signed contracts 2 weeks before the game came out that are free agents and the load time is terrible but i can deal with that a bit better then the rest of the stuff dont buy this game  also the frame rate randomly drops and the game crashes in the middle of you playing
13475,Completely trash. Once again. Dogshit.
13476,"worst 2k ever, its been worst and worst since 2K17
dont buy this game, its just an update of 2k19 that adds more glitches and bugs

WORST DEVELOPPERS OF ALL TIME (WDOAT)"
13477,"low quality server. tons of bugs. for instance, i cannot quit viewing rosters...the only way is alt+F4, which made me lost the update  downloading at 30%. it took me half an hour to download 30%...what a great server! and without the update, i cannot even continue MC! oh come on this is not a total new NBA game, after 20 years, what did you learn 2K?"
13478,Terrible game. My career wont load. Cant finish a my team match. Horrible launch.
13479,"for me, it is unplayable, making me angry instead of making me happy. Waste of way too much money and time."
13480,"Best 2K Gameplay yet. In the recent patch to fix things for console players, they broke the PC version, to where it renders all NBA games unplayable. I love the game, but wait a week or two before you buy so they can patch this again."
13481,What else am I gona play? NBA Live? lmao
13482,"So happy I paid for an unfinished game. So many problems.
:
No name on Jersey or in the stat line.
In Mycareer shot says 5% contested when I'm all over the guy. 
The release is so slow you need 20 ft of space to get a shot off. 
You miss 90% of your whites. 
So many more problems, don't have time to type them all."
13483,"This the worst nba so far. WORST!
going back to 2k19.
"
13484,game is shit
13485,"This was the worst drop of 2k ever, i literally don't even want to play the game. I get no progress in my career for attributes or badges, every time i get to team practice it says its over and i cant do any drills to keep grinding and upgrade my player. I've heard people aren't getting rep in my park either but i mostly play my career and so far this game gets a 0 from me. Never buying a 2k after this, disappointment year after year and now this just way over the top. What do i get for pre-ordering a legend edition? I get to upgrade my player with the vc it comes with and then have his progress for attributes and badges freeze and can't do any drills in practice to try and get xp to upgrade my player so i can enjoy the game i payed for."
13486,"The only reason I play this shit is I got no choice, curry up NBA Live!!!"
13487,"Shit game, I crashed four times in the same match in mc mode and it will happen everytime. I can't finish that match to continue mc."
13488,Game crashes randomly if you take a timeout in MP. Loading times in park are utterly slow. settings are being reset before games and so on...
13489,video file is corrupted tried redownload still have problem fix plz for fk sake ronnie 2k
13490,"still the same p2w game as every year, same bugs, same crashes, bad optimisation for pc, problems with hackers. Unfortunately its the best basketball game in a pile of shit that this genre of games is."
13491,"numerous bugs, basically same content from last year's version"
13492,"can't connect to 2K servers.
there is NO MyCareer in the main menu for me and NO way to fix it. 
complete waste of money, refund
"
13493,"I solely play offline, mostly MyLeague, and the game has been great so far. It actually runs better on my PC than 2K19 and looks and feels amazing in gameplay. I get a lot of the gripes and it's a bummer to hear about bugs, etc, although the worst thing about this game is a toxic community. If you don't care about online play, give this basketball sim a try and test out MyLeague."
13494,I love getting a loss after a disconnect while being up 57-13.
13495,not fun for pc
13496,玩过了次世代和本世代21这俩垃圾之后 才发现20是真的好玩 我错了2k
13497,"Don't buy this game yet for PC. It's so so buggy. Everything went fine for me through the initial story mode in MyCareer. Once I got to the regular season is when it just all went downhill. The bug that won't let you sim until your next appearance happens almost every time I have to sit on the bench. The game has stopped responding on me at least 3 times. It took me half an hour just to get through one game after restarting the game a bunch of times. Tried some ""fixes"" off of the 2k Support website and they didn't work. Just gotta wait until they patch the game. I think this will be a good game after its patched, but why don't they release a finished working version of the game on release day? 

IN SHORT -- Wait to buy."
13498,This is clearly the best basketball game on the PC by a mile. Yet year after year you get overwhelmingly negative reviews by spiteful players.
13499,Game won't even load.
13500,"Those of you on the fence deciding to purchase this title DO NOT DO IT YET!!! The last 2k Title I have purchased was 2K17 and from my experience the only thing that changed are the team rosters. Sure the animations and graphics are a little bit smoother from the game that will soon be 3 years older, I would have hoped that issues from 2k17–19 would have ironed out already. Jokes on me I guess. 
What ever has been “improved” gets massively out shined by the countless issues that plague this game right now. I don’t even have to go over the greedy micro transactions u have to dump into your player to actually have fun or stand a chance online. I wouldn’t be surprised if they patched in a option to just straight up buy badges because the progression rate is a joke. But the main punchline, finishing a game and then it crashes making you have to replay that game all over. My park same thing, crashes and 0 progression. I even lost a whole rep lvl when I tried to play the next day. Oh and the server quality... free to play games have better servers than this 60 dollar game  how is that possible??? 90% of this game is based on online game play and the same server issues are still here from 2k17 h"
13501,"improved mycareer this time around that's cool

will continue to give a negative review every year that they do not add an anti cheat."
13502,First NBA 2k game since 2k17. Three years later game is trash once again and the only good mode which was myGM is now f'd up as well. honestly never thought it could get worse than 'frequency vibrations' and 'orange juice'.
13503,"nba 2k19 v1.5
"
13504,well there is something I learned from this garbage... I am not as slow as a NBA pro athlete
13505,"Good Evening all, yes we are all aware that 2k needs fixing, I am not going to complain about that at the moment as I see that everyone has different problems, but i only came up with a few problems at the moment such as not being able to reecord game caputres using the xbox game bar/. In my opinion the game is fun but the servers needs alot of attention and some badges as well. The storymode felt inconsistent and putting all of this hype around your character regardlees if hes good or not without even steeping on an actual nba court. it felt rushed and wasted that had promise   but came up short. the draft combine and the character progression however is pretty good but just wait for a price drop if you are not a big nba fan, (FYI) consider cross-play please 2k the pc community is dying"
13506,"So first off, I'm a fool for buying the game this year. No way around it. 

Now lets get to the game itself. 
From my 7-8 hours of gameplay, i still see the same issues that the last few editions had. Let's name a few. 

Disliked the archetype system? Well this year that's changed, into the exact same thing without the names. There's literally no difference, except instead of sharpshooter/slasher/defender/etc, you now have pie charts that does the exact same thing.
Want a Melo clone? Well fuck you, have a watered down version that either doesn't know how to finish at the rim, shoot 3's, post up or have a ball handling stat that will enable you to go by terrible defenders. Chose 2, and forget all about defence. 
Wanna make a fucking Terrence Ross? Well pick between Dunks, 3pt and finishing at the rim. You can't have all 3. 

Wanna double team? You'll get minus point for leaving your assignment. Doesn't matter if you get a steal and win the game because of it. You left a person open, so the game will fault you for it. 

Got less than 70 in block rating? Your character will jump AWAY from the ball. I've played and trained basketball for tiny people. Even the 8 year olds know to jump TOWARDS the ball. 

Dislike cutscenes? Well bohoo. This game will force you to watch them. 

Liked last years choices when it came to MyGM? well fuck you, this year you only get the storied version that nobody liked in 2k19.

I could go on and on and on and on and .... But seriously, we all knew this was gonna be the game. 1 step forward 1 step back. Of course if you expect any focus on online play and hackers, well you're as big an idiot as i was. 

I realise my next words are gonna sound cliché, but I won't be buying 2k games for a few years.

I shouldn't have bought it this year, but i somehow fell for their marketing tricks and decided to give them 1 last chance. And holy fuck do i regret doing so. 

This is a trash game made by a trash developer, produced by a trash production team. 

It's trash.

1st Edit: So i've played a bit more, and i've encountered so many other issues, that i think i need to keep going with this. Bear in mind that these are all bugs that were in previous years editions too.

If you pass and the ball even scratches a player on the opposite team, it's about 50-50 if it'll count as a turnover or not. Doesn't matter if they actually had control over the ball or not. 

I'm currently an 80 overall, despite not having a single attribute above 70, and alot of my attributes being below 50. So this year we're able to play as the most overrated NBA star to ever grace the earth. Thanks 2K, you sure know how to give people what they want. 

Demarcus Cousins. So his injury apparently affected his shooting mostly, since he's now in the mid 60's on open 3 pointers, and high 50's on open midrange shots. Of course we all know lower body injuries fuck with your hands. 
But in that case they must have changed his tendencies too right? Nope. Every time i pass to him, he takes the jumper and of course misses. He might honestly be the worst player in the game right now, considering his stats vs tendencies. 

Teammates don't run their lanes or roll towards the basket. The amount of times a teammate will move to my exact position instead of rolling to an open basket is like 99% of the time. 

I'm using a Dualshock 4 Controller, and despite it being fully supported on the PS4, it's still not fully supported on PC. The game tells me to pass by pressing ""A"" despite my controller not having any ""A's""."
13507,"MyGM mode is somehow WORSE than last year, even though this new mode is dubbed ""MyGM 2.0"". This shit is fucking trash, don't waste your money. I got this as a gift and I feel bad that my friend even bought this for me. 


If you really want to play this shit, wait until it's 20$ or something, literally not worth a penny more than that."
13508,明明修复一下bug就是一个好游戏，偏要不管不问，mc不加经验你让玩家玩什么，你是逼着不想开挂的玩家开挂啊
13509,Server is SHIT! Nothing more than fking ubi's server. Even Ubisoft knows developing their server!
13510,"I only play MyLeague, the last game mode that helps me get my money's worth from 2K."
13511,Last time I ever buy an NBA 2K game.
13512,"I paid 90 dollars for a broken version of 2k19, I could've bought 40 cheese burgers with all that money, but i didn't."
13513,imagine they game just released 3 day ago and people start cheating on park
13514,"Cannot stand anymore. Starting from 2K19 cause I played a lot I found this series is a trash! First of all, force you to pay but not even pay to win, you have to gamble. You cannot even compete with computer if you dont pay in MC or MT mode. Try yourself as a 65 overall in MC NBA game and you will be like a fool. Try  yourself with sapphire or lower card to play against diamond or higher card team and you will see god. Difficulty is a joke, if you have galaxy opal cards, hall of fame is easy. Secondly, make the offline content worse and force you to play online mode so go back to rule No.1. Thirdly, trash-like servers all around the world. No matter you are in US/EU/Asia, you will face network error anytime and loss your game progress no matter what you did. Not to mention there is a super lag in the server response which make the online play unplayable. (So you have to pay the money but we dont make sure there is a good server, hahhh) Fourth, so many bugs in the game. Players like air can run into each other's body/face/ball in the game if you look replay which is ridiculous. Auction house in MT mode cannot work correctly. Eg, if you search for silver cards, you will find bronzes. Auction house even broke down in the final month of 2k19 which means they dont fix it for the whole year when you play! 3 vs 3 offline in MT mode is unavailable. (Did 2k really serious to launch an unfinished game?) The program icon for 2k20 is still 2k19! So 2k is telling you directly that we are selling 2k19 again and you need to know all the customers you guys are fool! Last but not least, in the online game mode, so many cheaters, they use super power they force you to lose connection and lose the game but 2k did nothing. They only care about how to push you to spend more money but not the game experience!
Overall, 2k basketball series is DEAD already and I really hope a new series to be available on PC, eg LIVE from EA, welcome back. I would try any other basketball games if they are close. DO NOT let 2k have this super monopoly in PC platform any more! THEY DONT DESERVE!"
13515,"I've been a patriot to NBA 2k for almost a decade. But as new versions of the game get introduced each year, we're treated with almost the same features with only some minor tweaks and changes. I wish 2K stops producing yearly NBA 2k iterations and focus on a single one with timely updates. I'm fine with the microtransactions but would've been great if I stick to a single MyPlayer for years instead of making a new one each year. Also, I wish 2k were a bit friendlier to PC users. There has been a considerable number of 2k Players who game on the PC (including me) but they still haven't catered to that market."
13516,fucking badge glitch frozen shit... no progress!!!
13517,"2K20 with 2K19 icons kidding you not, developers copy&paste and an brand new 2K game this year!"
13518,"(Updated)
I can't say anything about multiplayer modes. But if you're mainly a MyCareer player, then this game just satisfies that yearly craving for a new storyline.

Game is playable since the beginning of 2020. I've played for about 30 hours since and have not had any problems like the ones from last year.
==========================
I should have listened to the negative reviews. I bought the game because I skipped NBA 2k19. Hoping that the game is actually playable. I'm mostly a MyCareer player. Before today I was always booted out due to server issues. Now, I just cant get MyCareer load. It is stuck at 96%.

Don't buy this until January or February next year if you are planning to."
13519,"pay to win, there are already 90+ overall players with just 2 days of game"
13520,"This is the most broken game I have ever bought.

- No name on jersey
- No rep
- Shoe transactions are duplicated (paid twice with VC)
- long load times
- copied and pasted most things from NBA 2k19

overall this game feels very cheap with zero effort made compared to other NBA 2k series.
Stay with 2k19, no point buying the same game twice. MyCareer mode did not live up to any hype,
story line is really disappointing with nothing notable. The actual games feel a lot slower defensively, and on offense, it
feels way too easy to cross anyone. (Shooting feels slow, but i think there are badges for it later on) The new character build 
makes defense look useless. anyways, hate this game, really want to return it at the same time i wish 2k would send out an update to fix it. in the meantime, stay away.

(there was an update just now with zero fixes on any of my issues)

"
13521,Booo 2K
13522,"Here is what I have to say about NBA 2k20. Are there improvements? of course. The game plays better than 19 and career feels like a fucking career finally. There are some interesting dynamics that have been introduced and should make for an exciting year. The grind has been somewhat cut down! getting a higher overall and ranking up in park seems easier if you know how to play. 
The park is the same however. Minor changes but not enough to call it a brand new park. The game constantly crashes on me and Im running an i7-8700 with a Asus 2080.-. so it's not my rig. There are already people hacking which I can handle but for some fucking reason, Centers are able to boost and run as fast as guards... wtf.... and that is due to the update that 2k just dropped yesterday. 

I could honestly go on but I'm sure the majority of you already know what I'm talking about. It's sad that we don't have many other choices but to either run 2k or not play basketball. Assholes have us in a tough spot. Good luck, Hoopers! I hope we can get this game fixed."
13523,Its a good game everyone is saying shit and its fun to play neighbourhood is lots of fun getting badge is more challenging now JUST Freaking calm down and dont be sheep to what other people are reviewing its great buy and play :)
13524,Game is 2k19 with some new nba players. Absolutely nothing changed with character creation. Nothing changed accept some few little tweaks to the gameplay itself. Sucks ass and I'm going to request a refund
13525,"You know how EA has Madden? Well...2K has NBA...

Yeah, the game is decent but 2k16 was decent as well. Today I can't play My Carreer no longer because they shutdown the servers forever and you require ONLINE to play against CPU in my carreer because that asshat ronnie2k needs some people buying 10k VC to upgrade your jumpshot from 71 to 72 so he can hang out with the hottest dudes in the NBA.


Suck my escrotum ronnie"
13526,i like that they got rid of the archetype system i  just enjoy playing the game been playing since 2k16
13527,"(Don't mind the played time shown here - I've played a few hours on a friend's console port).

This is a terrible iteration of the 2k franchise and the only one of the past 4-5 I've requested a refund on. It's a copy and paste fest through and through and egregious with it's cutting corners.

I'm a MY GM player and have always liked the option to build a team through trades/the draft and then play around with that team whenever I wanted to in the past games. However, with this game's god awful AP system, I cannot do that. 

Instead of being able to build your team and staff and play at your leisure, you're now given a quota of points and games are auto-simulated behind the scenes. You can either take control of your team and play the basketball games, OR do the team building stuff... not both like you could in past games. Why restrict a game mode this way? What was wrong with the old way of giving us GM players the option to do both if we wanted?

It's garbage. Guess I'll stick with 2k19 for another year."
13528,shit game!
13529,"Least consumer concious product I've ever purchased, a great way to light $60 on fire without having to clean up the ash."
13530,Servers is garbage. Can't play REC with other 4 friends.
13531,I don't understand this hate. They've made a lot of stuff but I guess people'd like new game with new mechanics. For me that's better then 2K19 and gameplay've changed.
13532,"what kind of joke of a company releases a game with so many bugs BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN MAKE YOUR PLAYER HOLY ****. for one whole day theres a bug that doesnt let me accept or negate the nba2k20 news so I'm stuck on the screen, thanks for nothing"
13533,"Preordered the Legend Edition and these items are missing.

- 20 MyCAREER Skill Boosts
- MyPLAYER Shoe Collection

It's a complete recycle of 2K19 with a few new faces, and jerseys. The icon on the taskbar even says 2K19."
13534,"I tried to like it, I didn't play 19, but the micro-transactions are ridiculous and it crashes frequently"
13535,a lot of bad reviews. Yes it's almost a copy paste from last year. But I liked it. Some patches and the game can me pretty good
13536,Bought it just to dislike it.
13537,"EDIT: I wrote this review during release hoping for once 2K would work with the community like a pipe dream. It's kinda fun, it's also kind of mind boggling it's $60 every year but has worse support than a free to play 2D basketball game. (Seriously....I'd say there's better support for Freestyle Basketball2 than 2K has ever received on PC.)


It is one of the better NBA 2K's I've played in a long time since MyCareer has been added. The ability to truly dictate how my player is played based on the build I want has been something I've wanted for quite some time. It is probably the easiest of the last 3-4 games that I can not only level my player in but the grind seems satisfying for once.

I can't speak much into myTEAM's over-the-top antics, if you open it and decided to pull your wallet out, like Marshawn Lynch said (a bit rephrased), ""you know why you're here."" I can't speak to the park being reused assets with improvements here and there. (Which I honestly have zero problems with the same park. They're adding new events, seasonal parks, etc. Giving me the exact same park and then having nothing to show as an upgrade to it would be bothersome.) 

Now, would I recommend this NBA 2K to everyone? Not if you're on PC. PC has had this game for about 7-8 years now and it's consistently the afterthought, red-head stepchild, bastard that 2K continues to push out without providing any community support from someone over there. There's been a few years where they've peeked in the room on talking to us and then removed themselves from the equation immediately. I get it, we don't make up the majority of your bottom line, but we could easily be apart of that if you would willingly develop the game and support it properly on this platform.

Don't buy it if you're interested in playing myTEAM, the underlying system for myTEAM's gameplay has gotten better (no more out of position plays) but the overshadowing whistles and bells for what looks like a gambling with some of the worst RNG I've ever seen and believe me. (Try to TET something in Black Desert Online and know this is at least two times worse.)

P.S. Seriously 2K, support the game properly on Steam/PC. Past few years there have been a plethora of people with glitched players. It was highlighted by two of your major content creators. That's a PROBLEM."
13538,"The game is good... but it seems more like an update of 2k19, I understand that if the user buys the previous one they should put a special price on it, because  60 dollars every year for the same game  with some new things ... it’s not fair."
13539,i cant run my career in my pc
13540,Recycled.
13541,"Don't look at all these bums with negative reviews talking about micro transactions.

You won't see any in-game unless you want to see them.

Talking about grind? 2 days after the game was released I'm 83 OVR without spending a single penny.

The game itself is really great this year, it's like a mix of previous 2Ks and the new player builder is just insane!

Only bad thing about this years 2K is the music playlist, it really sucks...

EDIT: ok, the music is cool this year as well."
13542,"game update stucks at 0% all the time
and when i started my career i only see green screen while 2 persons talking"
13543,"Absolute TRASH. 7 hours played, 1 hour of gameplay and 6 hours of glitches, bugs and loading time. Good game if you want to waste your time."
13544,"Nearest defender: *is at the other half of the court*
2K: ""100% SMOTHERED"""
13545,Buy it on sale and you will walk away a winner
13546,"List of a few of the bugs I've came across: (Edited June 2020)

MC you cannot simulate to next appearance.
Turn the frame rate over 60 the game itself starts to slow down, so 1 second takes about 5 seconds.
Loading screens just frozen end game till it loads to the next area.
Lag out during practice. I'm the only human in the game world how am I timing out?
The story is over in about 3 hours only about 5 games, compared to last year 7-8 hour and whole campain with g-leage team. (the intro/outro and credits were about the same as the whole story)


Wait till they fix the game. Tested on 3 high end computers
9900k/2 2080tis ftw3
8700k 2080ti FE
6700k 1080ti.
Drivers and game both up to date.


Final Edit August 2020 before 2021. If you can get the game on sale for $15 do it, outside of that still a buggy mess. 

Few fixes I have found, Play the game in borderless window or fullscreen..."
13547,myplayer name missing!! no fix at all..
13548,"I'm playing 2K, since 2014. Except this year, i've purchased gold edition packs. I've started to play on PS4, but this season i prefer to play on my windows pc because last 2 years i haven't had good experience on PS4 server(i thought its just because PS servers) (i realized that PS servers are innocent) 

Dear 2K, I'm living in Shanghai China. I have 200mbps stable connection speed and i don't have any problem about my online games. Except 2K. Actually i already done with playing ONLINE. Im disappointed. I don't want to play your game online. I gave up already. I can't change my hairstyle aswell. Because of your PERFECT SERVERS. Usually im playing 'my career'. After every single game, when my character go to the neighborhood, connection lost. After Every single game. Can you imagine, how hard it is ? Feel me ? Im sick and tired to waiting my opportunity to play mypark again. I am waiting more than 3 years and im done. You definetely lost me. I keep playing my career without any mypark game for my own pleasure. But i have to put some warning sign here for the other gamers.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME 

2K SERVERS SUCKS

IF YOU ALREADY PURCHASED THE GAME, DO NOT BUY ANY OF IN GAME MONEY (VC)

2K WILL NEVER FIX THEIR SERVERS FOR ASIAN PLAYERS (ESPECIALLY FOR CHINA) almost 1.5 billion people living here

HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED

THEY DESERVED THEIR REVIEWS: OVERWHELMINGLY NEGATIVE

IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BUY THE GAME, READ THE REVIEWS FIRST.

WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY
"
13549,"Same game as last year really the only good thing is the my builder. They keep fucking over their community and continue to copy and paste, it's pretty insulting towards the NBA community and NBA as this game represents it to some extent. They need to spend less time on the story and make the process of a my career game faster if we're are to grind it for badges which no ones likes or make the park equal like Ronnie said but here we are with nothing like that. It's sad really that 2k can't make a concept that's the same every year into a different and original new nba2k when other company's make games from scratch. They're just lazy asf and I wouldn't trust anything that Ronnie 2k says. Servers are dog shit too."
13550,"Game is filled with game breaking bugs, got to play 3 park games while crashing 3 times, also crashed twice because squading up makes you crash, you can't play on 144hz because you won't be able to sim to next time you play in mycareer as it only works on 60hz... Are you kidding me 2k?"
13551,"Most broken 2K ever.
Go play last years 2K, don't bother buying this one, especially because 2K don't give a flying f**k about the pc community.

Servers laggy and unstable, also they crash a lot.
AI still more dumb that my 4YO brother.
Park is the same as last years (they changed some minor things nobody cares about).
NEW AND IMPROVED: HACKERS ARE BACK AND BETTER THAN EVER.
You have to grind for months or spend all your money to become a decent rank."
13552,"Scripted as hell. No, no, no more. Ever."
13553,#fix2k20
13554,Full of micro transactions.
13555,its like they want you to use money and upgrade your player its so fucking hard
13556,Game keep crash and the website dont let me to told me that my error code is not avaiable
13557,"... time to reinstall 2k19, why play a broken copy of a perfect game."
13558,"terrible and slow. copy pasta of 2k19, so glad i didnt get last years version. 2k20 park exact same as 2k19 LOL."
13559,Lot lot lot of microtransactions! The game feel like some free mobile game rather then AAA title that cost 50 euros. Simply your progress in almost every part of game is slow down drasticly if you want to grind and not spend lot of money. And simply there are very small changes from 2k18 or 2k19.
13560,Yes if you don't experience any crashes. If you do.... then ********
13561,"So First of all I always love Basketball, About the gameplay and the mechanic i feel the same with NBA 2K19. i buy this game just to make content on my YOUTUBE CHANNEL 
Another problem is while i wanna play online it sitll laggy and took long enough to find a player please imporve and fix it

and 2K can u give me a MEDIA KIT NBA2K20 iwould like to intoruce Basketball Through NBA 2K20 in indonesia

"
13562,"The worst NBA2K ever, way too many bug."
13563,Better than 2K19 but still needs some improvements. 7/10
13564,They tried to install transgender bathrooms in my arena and I said no so they moved the all-star game.
13565,Buggy! and the game is so slow!
13566,"No NBA Draft animation again, only a clip saying that you got drafted.
Gameplay makes absolutely no sense at some points (My 90 Overall Slasher PG can't outmove a 7"" Big Man most of the time. When i guard the other PG the arrow often switches randomly to another Player and i get bad grades because it says bad defending. I also dont like the Nickname they added again. I miss the time when they let the players decide what nickname we wanna use. The Neighbourhood isn't integrated that good. You're always in a menu and need to go there. I like the Pre-Draft frequences and also that you get 1.000 VC salary per game if youre good at them. The little things like tattoos and stuff seems a bit expensive to me tho. All around i would not recommend buying the game. I just hope they will do the draft like they did in 2K13 and fix the all around issues next year.
"
13567,"At this point I do not recommend this game for the following reasons:

* I have stumbled upon the bug that prevents you from receiving experience and badge progress after you have completed NBA game or Park game

* Loading screens takes a decade to decide what to do

* Poor servers, gives you all sorts of errors

Overall it's copy/paste from NBA 2k19, mypark is exactly the same, almost no changes. Gameplay feels... same. Archetypes are kinda different, but that's it."
13568,please 2k get rid of the hackers please jesus christ they ruining the game
13569,The game is incomplete and everything feels like you're being forced into playing the micro transaction ridden myteam so that they can reap in cash. The myGM game mode is worse than ever and you cant even play 12 minute games in it. Couldn't connect to servers and when they make online such a big part of a game this is hilariously bad. Luckily got refunded and will only look at repurchasing should there be a huuuuuge patch soon.
13570,this is easily the best 2k so far everything about this game is amazing. the best thing this year is mycareer the build system is so cool because you can make a bunch of good builds and there is way less blow by moves its balanced. post scorers are way less cheese and defence is way more smooth. so i realy reccommend this years 2k.
13571,"As of 9/9/2019 the game barely functions online. Nearly every features' availability is intermittent at best, from upgrading your myplayer to making a pro-am team. Stats disappearing off player cards, parks freezing up and forcing restarts. WHEN IT WORKS the gameplay feels great but sadly it's overshadowed by the ever-looming server problems."
13572,i fuckin love baseball
13573,"Seriously, we're on 2kWHAT now and there's still no sort of autosave involved with MyCareer games? It still makes you lose progress for the whole game if there's a possibility of losing connection to their shitty servers at the end of the game? Which is asinine by itself considering you're playing BY YOURSELF? WHY THE FUCK DO I NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SERVERS FOR A SINGLE PLAYER FUCKING GAME, FUCK YOU. it's absolutely ridiculous. very disappointed in this game. just stick with 2k19 for another year, or get this on one of their sales they do in a few months. this could have been a fucking update of 2k19 itself. Like everybody else said, when you start the game, it literally shows the 2k19 icon in the taskbar. That's fucked, fuck you 2k, eat a fucking dick."
13574,this's nba2k19 DLC(2020) right? Please cheak the game EXE file icon ！It is NBA2K19！！！@2K @2K Fvck!
13575,"Copy and paste from 2k19, but most of the game is even worse. Not to mention the bugs. How do you have so many bugs in a game that is 99% recycled from the previous year? Complete joke and cash grab."
13576,"I am leading 20 points in the my team unlimited mode. Then my opponent just leave the game, and then i receive a lose record wtf!?
"
13577,"trash game, hacks since day one, copy paste nba2k19, loadings for everything, 2k dont give a f*** about the pc users."
13578,"Trash server. After I played a 30min game and won against the HOF CPU, it said ""Failed to connect the server"". LOL. Pay2Win game."
13579,"People expect 100% done games but it's 2019. Every game comes out complete crap nowadays and gets upgraded day by day.
At the moment the game is full with issues but i'm sure that it will get better with time."
13580,bad
13581,"As far as MyCareer goes, I enjoy playing the game. I don't play any other modes so I do enjoy it. HOWEVER... The reason I'm voting this down is because the amount of time it takes to load between some scenes and selecting some options is unbelievable. Once this gets optimized, i'll change the my review."
13582,its 2k
13583,"Copy and Paste of 2K19 and its worse. My player has no name

REFUND"
13584,"A problem has been encountered that prevents gameplay from continuing. This game will not be counted,
same buggs same bs slow trash game"
13585,"I got this for free, and 2K should pay me back for wasting bandwith to download it."
13586,"I take back what i said before the park should be fixed, come on! and all other parts of online, my internet is great no other problem with any other game online"
13587,Suck
13588,"terrible refund requested I expected more 2k.

Terrible game online is trash and the servers are so bad. I don't have a clue why the game crashes every 30 mins and its freezes so much I expected more from 2k and I just learn that anything over 2 hours playing time though steam no refund or credit nothing you just out as a customer. Something told me to buy this game through Amazon just in case but lesson learned."
13589,Better then NBA Live
13590,"trash game, trash 2K"
13591,What 2k is doing is beyond greed! And it's quite obvious what their intention is with this game; it's to milk their fanbase for every nickel and dime.
13592,fucking trash game
13593,FFS 2K.. What did you do to the gameplay? And all these bugs. Unplayable game. Unfinished. Totally trash. I hope EA bring back Live in a great addition to this piece of garbage.
13594,I can't speak for others but I have had several issues with server connectivity. I've had to replay games in My Career over server errors.
13595,"I'm generally not one to leave reviews, but this game is so unpolished in places. I love 2k, have put in well over 100 hours into each of the last couple of editions. I don't play online, and never have serious gripes about changes in gameplay. Usually I am unphased by the yearly wave of hate going towards 2k. This year is different, two big issues right away.

First: I'm not sure if everyone has this problem, but when I start in offseason in myleague and select to use the real 2019 draft class none of the rookies of the 2019 draft (ie zion, rj, morant) have scanned faces. They all have these generic faces which look roughly similar. All the attributes on them are the same, and their scanned faces do show up if I start at beginning of season, so I have no idea why this is happening.

Second: I keep getting an error code: 95b37d16, which doesn't even register on the 2kstatus webpage youre supposed to check when receiving error codes.

Additionally, I feel like the load times are even slower than last year, and in game advertisements for money-grabbing features are even more prevalent."
13596,"I bought this game just for the annual check-up on if the alleged developers have fixed the very basic features, which would serve as the basis for this game to start distantly resemble a team sport. I try to enjoy this game as a realistic basketball simulation, playing mostly 5v5 vs AI. I find it hard to enjoy this game.

No. The automatic playcalling option still doesn't not work. The on-going bug since atleast NBA 2k16, has not been fixed. 

No. As a ballhandler, you still cannot protect the ball, if you want to call a play from the playbook. Or call any offensive tactic, whatsoever.

These two flaws alone should help you decide in favor of not purchasing this game. I don't realistically see anyone with any bit of basketball history, to be able to enjoy this game, due to these two afore mentioned flaws in the game alone.

The ballhandler being restricted from simultaneously protecting the ball and calling a play, is claimed to be an intended functionality by the ""product support"". That feature interplays together with the automatic playcalling bug. Often times a play is automatically called, that directs AI players to bring their defenders close to the ballhandler, who is desperately trying to go through the clunky playbook UI. While restricted to be able to protect the ball. In this year's ""rendition"" of the ""game"" there is an extra layer of UI to choose and pass as you try to call a play from the playbook as a ball handler. This makes it even slower to call a play. The NBA 2k19 displayed the most lopsided AI perimeter defense. Allen Iverson was unable to dribble to the basket through the perimeter defense of the likes of Shaq. That aspect of the game has been balanced. But with this new UI rework, we stand at the same woeful situation as with NBA 2k18.

I'm forced to use quotations around the words developers, game, edition, version, rendition, bug and fix. The product support claim, that known bugs will be fixed in future game versions. If it's called a _game version_, why do we have to pay full price for it, just like we would for a brand new game? On the other hand, if it's a brand new game, then why is it's functionality the exact carbon copy of its predecessor? Launched with a couple of broken features, which are then restored. Why would you call developers with the term developers, if they don't develop anything? They merely break aspects of the game, and then restore them back. They forgot to update the taskbar logo from 2k19 to 2k20. Worst gaming franchise by far."
13597,lost my player first day and they send me a email to download from the cloud for console when i put windows 10 and PC but i guess they can't even listen.
13598,all the time is shutting down...
13599,everything bad.
13600,"If i could i would sue this company. they promise so much, but in the end they take your cash for trash. The reason why its trash is because of the bugs and all the disconnect. Whole squad litreally have to alt+f4 min 5 times or more before we have a slight chance that everyone gets in the game. Today we tried to go in rec after trying in 2 hours. finally we didnt get a bug where people froze. and when we go in rec one of us crash again. so now we 3 out of 4 in the rec. and we have to leave again. So i started playing story mode. guess what it also crashed. Now im done, i want to write a refund but i dont think i can cus i already used the 2 hour limit, when i used 7 hours to get on the game."
13601,2k why the heck do bugs keep popping up in a copy/paste game every single dang year?? when i try to skip to my next appearance in mycareer it doesn't auto pop up with the choice to skip so i have to spend like a whole minute just waiting to skip every single time and it even crashes my whole damn computer occasionally when i try to skip. please spend time fixing these things now rather than a few months from now and fixing an exploit that apparently popped up last night and fixing it the morning after. use some of that big brain energy
13602,"I just love the fact that 2KTV actually did a whole bunch of episodes of interviews with the fans telling us how great they think the game is. Blah the rating on Stream says it all. I hope 2K21 will be a total flip around otherwise I'm not buying it.
BTW is NBA live 20 on PC?"
13603,"It has so many bugs and issues it is unbelievable ! I cannot even play online, controller never works there."
13604,"pay to win
crashes randomly without an error message (same as it has since 2K17)"
13605,"Don't buy this shit game. Literally has the same 2K19 icon in the taskbar, cause it's the same shit with little changes. I regret spending money for this stupid game, I wouldn't accept it even if someone was giving it for free."
13606,"The only reason I bought it on launch is because I haven't had a game since NBA 2K12 and wanted to play a more recent game. In retrospect, buying NBA 2K19 on sale during the summer would have been the wiser purchase. Terrible bugs and performance."
13607,"Shows 2k19 icon in the task bar, which prove 2k20 = 2k19= 2k21?"
13608,"just tryna put the reviews up lads

Yeah i'm still trying"
13609,"Yikes. Among other things, can't sim to next appearance in myplayer and have to watch the game move at half speed slow motion. Myleague mode is playable so that's nice. 2080 ti."
13610,Do not pay more than 20 bucks for this 2K19 (2020 version).
13611,Worst game ever.
13612,"I never write a comment but this shitty game makes the first time for me to leave a comment here

This game crash every single time when i try to go online and i think one of my saving file had been corrupted and crash everytime i load it in, in which i spend like 20,000 VC on that data file.

Please fix this crashing thing asap. Did you guys ever try it before you release this game?

So DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!"
13613,Best 2K yet!!!!!
13614,"The game is the same even icon on tool bar says NBA 2k19 
New sound track is good
New MyPlayer customization is good too
MyTeam servers are bad just lag"
13615,absolute fucking garbage
13616,"Same game as last year, don't waste your money! Still sucks"
13617,anyone else having trouble when u try to play my career the screen turns green but the sound in the back working all fine?
13618,"It's pretty good, a couple of new things, but mostly copied from last year.

The funniest thing is that when you alt+tab you can see the nba 2k19 icon in the taskbar, that's pretty sad."
13619,The game is fire idc bout no Casino i came to whoop ass and thats all im going to do
13620,ok story line in the personal career mode. couple of glitches here and there but an overall improvment.
13621,"Best basketball sim out there. I only play MyCareer (NBA games), MyLeague and Play Now. 

Don't bother with MyTeam AKA the casino mode yet. I only play it late when they giveaway rare cards."
13622,"Nothing more than a replica of last years game with new badges and ways to spend money on a player... Not to mention the smaller community on PC. If your gonna get it, get it on console... Otherwise stay far far away. REFUND!"
13623,amazing game but the fucking servers are shit once again
13624,GOOD BUT A LIL GLITCHY
13625,tooooooooooooo  rubbish
13626,"Defense is so broken. At first, my PG build was a defensive liability on the court and I just figured it was because I prioritized my build in other categories. So then I make a player with defense as a higher priority - STILL horrible defense. Ok, must be because I need to level up. Nope. I'm seeing average players get green shots and fade aways right under the basket that should be impossible. Theres a new ""coverage"" meter for the defense that is completely broken. I'll be close enough to kiss the guy and it'll say 12% covered. I'll jump straight up to go for the block, make body contact, says ""8% covered"", guy gets green shot. WHAT???

Also, it's nearly impossible to get enough stats to get more minutes when no one will throw you the ball. I get that you have to build team chemistry and then eventually they will throw you the ball on command, but I'm making cuts that Lebron couldn't chase down and they'll pass me over for a terrible shot from the corner. This game is bogus this year."
13627,"This is not fun, grinding is already hard and then now I can't even earn MyPoints, no badge and attributes upgrade. I will ask for a refund"
13628,I'm not going to buy NBA2K anymore. Get your money and get out of here.
13629,"My impression is that 2K was focusing in other games and didn't develop NBA 2K20 well enough. I hope the game gets better with patches because right now a lot of features missing in myGM and the myCareer ""story"" before entering the NBA can't edit the length at all..."
13630,Nice
13631,"We gave money for playing new nba game, not for same” 2k19 but servers not let us play adition” when you try to team up with your friends one of your games will be frozen(sometimes all of yours)  you couldn’t able to play rec if you somehow achieve that it means you are gonna get server connection lost.  So fuck this game but im still gona play bc im a patheatic cuck"
13632,"After 2K19 I thought there's no way 2K20 could be worse or even as bad, sadly I was proven wrong.

Actually it's so much worse than 2K19 it's just ridiculous."
13633,This game sucks.
13634,"First impressions:
MyGM
One can't change the quarter length in MyGM??!! 
It's static at 6 mins.
Also, it's filled with redundant (and they repeat the same ones, over and over) conversations  with the team staff/players.
I skip them, but it's annoying.

I give this 5/10 for now. I hope 2K fixes these two annoying flaws in MyGM."
13635,This game is terrible! Shuts off with a tons of errors and a ton of glitches
13636,"10/10 
They put a basketball minigame in one of the best gambling simulator game on steam!"
13637,"It's trash. 
Game crashes.
can't skip bench sometimes. gotta use ALT + Tab
It's soo slow.
Badges are trash and you can HOF next Easter and still would be trash 
Stamina is trash. 
VC to level up your trash from Trash to trash. Nothing changes. 
Strength, pie chart trash. 
Attributes, levels are trash. 
Don't buy it. I'm a 2K addict and I'm telling you to stick with 2k19.

THIS MAKES 2K19 LOOK LIKE JESUS,"
13638,"Heaps of bugs, terrible server"
13639,Great game guys. I don't know where this negative reviews come from. Good job devs.
13640,"Okay, been playing for ~310hours ish already, tried all modes, aside online connection problems due to sick number of players , have to say everything is really nice and smooth, I enjoy it, as PC version user I recommend for you getting Xbox joystick to connect 100 %, regarding VC easy to grind them, mhm what else, WNBA looked fun, the only downside I personally felt , they didn't implement on PC version chat with other people and voice talk, I hope thats coming this year in one of the updates ;) 
All in all, I'd say from all the past NBA versions, this one is the only one which is worth the money you pay :)"
13641,"1) Always crash
2) Game icon is 2k19 LMAOO
Please fix this, don't want to spend 40 dollars just to get a damaged game."
13642,Normalized stats to to sim quarter is broken!!!
13643,"Just keep press ""space"" button when u start the game dude if u are using keyboard"
13644,Pretty alright game.
13645,"Pros :
better defensive adjustment (steal indicator)
myplayer creator looks better than last year
you can choose whatever badge you want your player to have
new shot meter (splash etc.)
made it harder for players to score in the paint
new player badge (rookie to elite etc.)
Rookie Draft Combine (😱😱😱) 


Cons :
same old playground
minor bugs
still long que in MyRec and proam
long loading times

but overall this game is better in terms of gameplay compared to 2k19.
would still recommend it to players 👍👍👍


EDITED : now the game is forcing you to watch unskippable adds. very annoying to be honest. 👎👎"
13646,"Honestly, I am extremely disappointed  in the 2k development team. We're still dealing with the same problems from NBA 2k16 for ex: save files keep getting corrupted and you NEED to be connected to the internet to play ""MyCareer"" which is absolutely annoying when you spend 20+ minutes on a game only to get greeted by ""We can't connect to our servers"" and loose all your progress and have to do it all over again. With the same old engine getting constantly recycled and the game breaking glitches you will encounter you're better off just buying an older version of this game which is a shame because it felt they were finally heading towards the right direction with your MyCareer character."
13647,"1. Bad sever connection, very unstable.
2. Name was blank on myplayer
3. The Chinese commentary often change to English
3. No big update vs 2k19, just name list update"
13648,Mamba forever
13649,"Id rather drink gamer girl pee, pee it out, then drink that pee, and then pee that pee into my own butthole than think about buying this game again. What an embarrassment. KYS"
13650,sometimes i wonder how big companies like 2k can mess up this bad.....
13651,"If you're into basketball and love sports games, I can recommend grabbing this when it's on sale."
13652,"Tragically bad, we have been lied to with false advertising about what the game would be. disgussting really"
13653,"Dont buy, just play 2k19, that trash is actually better then this."
13654,"if you like the nba you should get it, but don't buy it if you're gonna play multiplayer or have a bad computer. I only bought it for mycareer and myleague, servers on pc are garbage but i like this game it has a really good storyline compared to previous games and the game just feels really smooth"
13655,i cant even get to the main menu. There is no way to accept or decline locker codes and news. fucking trash didn't even get to play the game. Thanks
13656,people like myself spend money on these high powered pcs but with this game for example is pure bs graphic look like playstation 1 but every other game i play is great going to give it until monday if it's not fixed everyone should be allowed they money back and just buy nba live
13657,"Server is quite stable now but still slow to load, but overall still a good game. (At least for single player)

Just a suggestion, maybe you could improve your highlight system in the future. Like adding Top 10 plays for myCareer. Like top 10 crossovers, assists, dunk. Also some highlight mixtape of your player. Something that we can share easily and not manually capture through replays."
13658,"This is my FIRST ever review of any game. 
DON'T BUY THIS GAME. I was a fool. This game is making me lose interest in the NBA as a whole. 
Glitchy. Takes THREE MINUTES to go from game screen to schedule. Then THREE MORE MINUTES to go from Schedule to Player progression to add points. Just now I added points to my stats and then waited five minutes before it timed out. I'm just trying to play my career. I don't even want to play online. Why do I have to load anything??? 
I will NEVER buy ANY game from EA again. Not NBA 2k, not Star Wars. Not ANY title. 
EA, you are the WORST people in the gaming industry. 
DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME."
13659,"Holy shiz. This game is awful. They changed up the mycareer slightly, but other than that this is an exact copy paste, SAVE YOUR MONEY SERIOUSLY PEOPLE."
13660,"I buy 2k20 beceause the sever for 2k17 is down, the gameplay and AI have huge improvement comparing to 2k17, but I am getting tired of listening to the same commentators over and over again, also the loading time in MC is frustrating.

If you never play 2K18 and 2k19, I think you will enjoy 2K20 because the changes are huge, otherwise I think you should just stick with your 2k19 until the sever is unavialiable, then you can buy a 2k21 or 22, it's just a better way to spend your money.

 我买2K20 是因为2K17 的服务器停用了， 对比2K17， 20 的操作性和AI都有很大的提升，但是令我没想到的是20解说的内容居然还是跟17差不多，然后MC模式的加载时间太长了"
13661,garbage
13662,Full of micro transactions. Yet nba fans have to buy it as there is no better alternative nba games for pc. I swear every nba fans/gamers would complain about nba 2k every year yet here we are buying it like the slaves of the game we are.
13663,"I expected a lot. MyGM this year is totally a trash. I hope NBA2K can still change around and change this feature. It's unplayable with those building relationships feature. I understand you want a change, but please do focus still on the gameplay while considering it's reality effect. 2K18 and 2K19 are way better than this one."
13664,"Pain In The ASS !!
"
13665,"Cash grab as usual, but it's the only decent basketball game out there... D:"
13666,Always crash (GTX 2080). Disappointing.
13667,"Currently this game is shite. However I can see it being fixed in next upcoming weeks or even months cause 2K won't give a shit bout PC release. I had no problems with MyCareer so far and I've enjoyed it except for the stupidly long loading times, the salary thing after every game is a big YES. MyLeague all good as well didn't wreck my enjoyment of the game however I went on MyTeam and god have mercy the input lag is atrocious, 0 defense can be played as players never manage to even turn the right direction in time.
So far I would only recommend this to play as an arcade game with few friends as couch co-op or do single player MyLeague and farm some VC."
13668,"


I really want to like this game, but it has been soooooooo buggy and crashes. Random and excessive load times between games, progression, etc... I even bought a brand new RTX card last week to really enjoy this game. And because this is so similar to last years neighborhood, crib, stores, gym, and everything else... I'm just so confused what the f'ing problem is here?! 

Great story though, awesome character creation options, love the badge upgrade system. A lot of good things in this game, sadly over shadowed by the bugs.

 I can't recommend this game in its current state.

2K, please fix the game we all love!!

UPDATE: 11/11/19

The game still crashes at the end of games played while doing the points load out. They don't care, they aren't going to fix it, and I think it might be time for a class action lawsuit since taking away those assholes money is the only thing that will get their attention.

I am so sick of having to replay games I have won and did amazing in, only for the game to crash, and replay the game with different and sometimes worse result from my crashed game... assuming that game doesn't crash too, which it has!!! Not to mention the time wasted replaying games I have already won!!!!!!!!!

I JUST WANT TO PLAY MY GAME WITHOUT CONSTANT CRASHING AND BS EXCUSES BLAMING THE USER AND THEIR EQUIPMENT!!! F U 2K!!!"
13669,"Cash grabbing game with gambling .. rated E for everyone.

Strauss Zelnick, 2k CEO is also the ESRB Chairman .. 🙂"
13670,"What the fuck is up with nba 2K20?
I really wanted to say this game is just like 2k19, but it's even worse.
The gameplay is extremely slow and defense is straight up horrible, seriously, the gameplay is so boring it's almost unplayable.
They didn't even bother to change the park, not even a little bit.
The game is filled with bugs and just seems terribly rushed, it even shows as an 'NBA2K19' icon in your hotbar.
Better luck next year 2K
"
13671,"always be halted
need to be fixed ASAP. 
"
13672,"For years I have been saying 2k is good, that the server issues arent as bad as people say. But this year? 2K is purely just a clone of 2k19, some name missing issues and crashes already happening to a lot of other players. 
The career cinematics where too short and rushed, 0 point behind them. So here 2k, a negative review from a longtime fan. Stop being so garbage"
13673,Need to be fixed
13674,"MyGM used to be the mode that I played all the time starting with 2K16. Look at my time in 2K19 on Steam; that's all MyGM.  It was what I moved to when they implimented the stories into MyPlayer. I could create said player and draft him and play through his whole career. I liked that you could customize it and that content creators could upload their rosters and/or draft classes for you to use so that you could sort of have updated rosters through a couple years (barring all the bizarre trades and the Spurs getting horrible no matter what). Along with that came customizable difficulty and sliders for contracts, trades, progression, and injuries that gave MyGM ""realism.""
At his point, all the customization I loved is gone and now it forces us to compete against each other in a ranking system in a single player mode that was just there for us to mess around in. They've stripped basically all the customization out of it save for the difficulty setting. You can't even play the full 12 minute quarters. I'm sure it's still in Season Mode, but I want that little difference between that and the old MyGM mode. It was just enough immersion for me to keep coming back to the game.
Another thing that kills it for me is MyPlayer. They told us that we could customize our player's progression and overall max stats individually, but that's only half true if I'm being generous. We still have to use the broken arc type system that can be abused in the Park and handicaps you in two skill areas. The only difference is that now we're even more restricted on how good our players can get because we have to allot our attributes within that arc type, and you don't enough ""upgrades"" to max out that arc type.
I'm also tired of these preludes and how heavy the mode focuses on story. I like seeing all these cameos, sure, but I remember back in 2K14 when the story was minimal and didn't impede on the fun of having your character actually somewhat be you. They were a blank slate and the arc type system still allowed your character to excel at all areas. 
They weren't forced into a set story-line that lasts hours longer than the actual gameplay it's supposed to build around. I don't care about the story. It's not engaging; it's disruptive. Sure, you can skip through it and ignore the whole story, but I couldn't even make it that far. And I don't want to play a ton of games that aren't even in the NBA before I can get drafted.
It wouldn't be such a problem to have them give us these narratives in MyPlayer or give us the new competitive MyGM mode if they would let us opt out of them for the classic versions. I can't imagine that it would even be that much work to do, they did it last year.
The last thing is Microtransactions."
13675,"Play now online is so bad in this game, nobody has quickdraw, they force you to play every tier to progress to next one, but matchmaking is always tier 3 against tier 1, which is total bulshit"
13676,"2k Servers remain terrible. DC'd from first 3 games on play now. Also they tried to fix gameplay by reducing sprint speeds - while the idea is good and you can't just blow by players, even athletic freaks now feel incredibly sluggish. I imagine they'll fix this in upcoming patches, but for now this game is not worth buying."
13677,This game is bad but imma keep playing cuz its 2k
13678,"Worst money spent ever. I rather wished I flushed that money down the toilet or bought a skin disease. Story in MyCareer is great, but gameplay is straight out trash. This game is all but finished development. DO NOT BUY and support 2K. This game is getting worse for every single year!!!"
13679,"I can't sim to next appearance in MC, and also found many other glitches. You developers didn't even finish your jobs. Stop scamming your customers, 2K !"
13680,I didnt know that 2k was 13+ so I put in my real date of birth and wasnt allowed to do myteam mycareer and my league so I just waisted $100 dollars
13681,"Too many bugs:
In MyPlayer:
1. Can't sim through to next appearance. you have to sit and watch from the bench
2. Player name disappears when you get through the story component, after I'd spend 36K VC to have a blank name player
3. Get stuck in doors trying to leave the gym
4. Can't exit the game, no one tested being able to quit the game? I have to task manage and stop the process. Wow!
5. load times are crap on an i7 8700
 


"
13682,this game is so broken its not funny i have asked for a refund it is so bad
13683,"Its not that bad as people portray it to be, people just some b!!!TCHES NO CAP"
13684,2 days in.. Still full of hackers/cheaters. WE WANT AN ANTI-CHEAT CLIENT OR VAC. Or even just a simple cheat engine detector/blocker. FFS. Rulers still ruling continuously for 4 years. Does 2k even care?????????
13685,ALT + TAB your way to 99 Overall
13686,"1. Crashes
2. Literally a casino
3. My career development takes forever
4. I'm not kidding, they didn't even change the icon. It still says 2k19
5. Delay when playing online
6. False advertisement
............................."
13687,"2k20 seem to be rushed to be released, way to many bugs and too similar to 2k19 to be purchased at this moment. I would skip this year and hope for a better 2k21"
13688,"People complaining cos it looks the same are idiots. Game is so much better, ability to create your own builds, choose badges etc is great. Also upgrading with VC is almost manageable now, not forced into the pay to win style.

Have yet to come across any major bugs, unlike 2k19. If you're someone (like me) who enjoys these games somewhat but hates the pay to win, limited archetype stile of play, this game is a must buy. Soooooo much better."
13689,Formatted my pc and all my park builds are gone... 2k support are trash and won't fix it but it instead mark my ticket as solved and give me useless link of how to recover XBOX and PS files
13690,Game is broken. Can't sim in mycareer. Name isnt displayed.
13691,Really like basketball games but 2K knows how to ruin it with VC and no rookie mode on my career come on let me play what every way i want and no updates on bugs or crashes
13692,"One of the many ""features"" of 2k20 is my career players being nameless after creating them with no way to change the name in career mode you are screwed and nameless forever. Don't worry though the pay to win mechanics are still firmly in place, so break out your wallets fam cuz its gonna be lit! On fire! 

Seriously this thing is a pile of shit dont buy it unless you want the same game as the last 4 yrs and the same bugs and pay to win as last year.

Update: fired up the game because lack of NBA has made me want to play to find out all my MyCareer characters are ""corrupted"" and deleted all 3 of my 95's. GG"
13693,"Horrible entry from 2K. I saw all the negative reviews and still gave it a chance. Refund inbound. Slow, Clunky, Horrible."
13694,"I literally can't click to accept or decline about hearing their 2k news so I can't even get to the opening menu. New record for how quickly a game has ever been unplayable.

PRO TIP: Apparently you have to spam space bar 20x when the game starts to get past it. SMH."
13695,"Broken POS game
This is the straw that breaks the camels back. This is bad enough we could sue Visual Concepts and 2K. 

I can hear it now, we get the mesothelioma guy...""Did you or someone you love buy NBA 2k20? You may be entitled to compensation for your pain and suffering."""
13696,lmao this game is so similar to 2k19 that it even says 2k19 instead of 2k20 on the windows taskbar
13697,"List of things I like about this game:

- Idris Elba

List of things I hate about this game:

- When the game doesn't let you sim to your next appearance, so you're stuck on the bench watching the CPU play and then the game goes in slow motion so now you're watching the CPU play sim basketball like a Zack Snyder movie.

- When you go into the gym in the neighborhood to check it out, and then the game doesn't let you leave even though you don't want to play bench press simulator 2k20

- When the game doesn't count any progress in games, whether it's MyCareer or park, meaning you played 12 minute quarters on the hardest difficulty just to get that fat 0.
- When I think 0 progress is bad enough, team practices now actually give me negative points and badge progress is reset to 0. Am I a joke to you? What am I Markelle Fultz?

- When you finally find a match in park which takes forever cuz there's no real matchmaking system only to have the game lock every person on the court so you have to force quit the game.

- When your MyPlayer name is removed and changed to "" "" once you create it like it thinks you trynna be Arya Stark"
13698,"Controls are mesmerisingly shit.
Park is the same. 
Game feels laggy.
Error.
Where tf is Tacko Fall."
13699,I hate ronnie and all 2k stuff omggg
13700,It's the same but a tiny bit better.
13701,"Haven't even been able to load a match. The game freezes at the loading screen and won't accept input from mouse, keyboard, or gamepad. I'm essentially stuck at the ""create a MyAccount"" page.

EA isn't interested in making games anymore, just micro-transaction loops. 

Lazy development at its best. I've requested a refund."
13702,"Thankfully, I've not had some of the problems that others are having with actually running the game. Playing mostly on My Career and other than some very bad choppy frame-rate on some of the cut-scenes (and during some of the half-time/ full-time shows) the game has mostly run fine. Don't get me wrong, there a ton of bugs, but I've been lucky enough not to run into any game-breaking ones yet. 

That said, I put in 760+ hours on 2k19, and after only about 20 hours of 2k20, i'm wondering if it's worth putting any more time in. 

The MyCareer story is kind of lame. Apparently, you become the Colin Kaepernick of college hoops. Lame as it is, it was also a little too short and a total waste of Idriss Alba's talents. 

There are also a ton of changes to systems and my neighborhood. A short tutorial or a write up would have been useful. For eg. how do you gain reputation, changes to the physical stats, etc. 

The tweak to player builds is interesting. I would say the jury is out on whether this is a good or bad thing. Same with the badges (swapping out badges at will seems like a cool thing, since there are badges that may be more useful for single player and others which may be more useful if you're playing multi). Except earning them now seems a lot tougher. Also happy not needing to go into the gym after every game to get turbo, that at least is a welcome change. 

But the new stat progression system kind of stinks in how you cannot put points into physicals (Speed, Acceleration, Vertical, Stamina). Apparently, these physical stats and kind of tied into the other stats and they increase bit by bit as you increase the other stats. In theory that sounds ok, but this does not translate well into gameplay once your player hits the NBA. In previous games, the first thing I did was to pump all points into the physical stats. If nothing else, it allows your player to be competitive and keep up with the PC players. This time round this is not possible. The system means you generally won't hit your maximum physical stats until you're close to maxing out ALL your other stats (i.e. end-game). It means you'll be slower, weaker and jump lower than most other PC players unless you are close to max stats. That combined with the change to turbo (using it really terribly drains your stamina) means that 1/2 the time PC players are blowing by you. That's crappy when you're a wing and guarding top-stars, who waltz into the paint at will. But the time i wanted to put my fist through the monitor was when i realised that as a SG, i could not outrun a Centre on a fast break. Things like that really affect enjoyment of the game and I cannot help but cynically feel that all these changes are intended to force players to spend $ on VC to max up faster. 

There is a new simulation system when you are subbed out. Previously, you just press A till you are subbed in or the game ends. Now, there is a choice to watch the game play on before subbing in - but apparently, quite a few players have complained that this feature is bugged and causes the game to go into slow-mo. I've not encountered this thankfully. But the developer who decided that it should be a good idea (when simulating to sub in) to be forced to watch the last few seconds of every half if you're not subbed in should be shot. After a while, it gets tiresome.

Been reading some other reviews on the changes to MyGM. They sound horrendous. After MyCareer, My GM is usually my next favourite mode. Apparently, MyGM has now become something like a mobile app game ... 

tl;dr, i think i hate 2K. 2."
13703,bad again
13704,"Bad game, crashes, bugs, same archetype system with a different look, microtransactions galore, etc. Don't buy it its a big waste of money."
13705,"Just copy and paste of 2k19 the taskbar icon is even the 2k19 icon, but the player building is different everything else is the same."
13706,"THIS GAME IS ""SOOOOOOOO SMOOTH"", THERE IS ""NO CRASH"" AT ALL........ IT'S NOT LIKE THEY BRING EVERYTHING FROM OLDER VERSION TO THIS, GAME SYSTEM IN MYCAREER CHANGED TO BETTER WHEN YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE TO MAX EVERYTHING YOU CAN IN THE SHOOTING IN ORDER TO SCORE WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE YOU JUST MISSED 90% OF THE TIME or you choose to dominate the glass which is also great when you cant even move your player to the glass without zero stamina. 2K, fix your goddamn game, the most frustrating of all... is why i have to wait for fucking 30 min to actually get on the court after being sub and the worst thing is, my game will crash. Well 2k btw.... 

SO This is the review, its a trap, dont buy the game"
13707,"Can't even play the ""biggest"" mode in the game, MyCareer. It won't let me sim in I have to watch the ai play until i get subbed in then when i do get subbed in the game is in slow motion. Why does 2k release a broken game, cmon. I just wanna grind my guy but i cant. The game also freezes from time to time, i cant get past this halftime in this game because of it.My computer exceeds the minimum system requirements btw."
13708,Anyone want to play and hop in a discord call
13709,gets slower and slower for each year. the simming in myleague takes forever. 2k done a shit job once again
13710,"this game would open millions of instances of windows explorer whenever i launched it, to the degree that nothing on the pc worked anymore. 

no other games do this. 

i asked for a refund, and got it. 
gross gross gross gross gross. 

0/10 stars for not being able to work on my high end rig."
13711,"if you like the 2k series just get the game, if you've seen many reviews about gambling and blah blah etc, half of them kinda over exagerate regardless, its not even gambling really, its just a sales pitch, if you chose to gamble after playing this game, then write a negative review :)"
13712,Too laggy... cant even shoot a single shot in park mode
13713,"An almost exact copy of 2k19. If you take a gander at the icon in your bottom bar while the game is on, you will see even the icon is still 2k19. LOL these devs are so lazy and ridiculous. It's a clone with a little polish, but as you can see, you can polish a turd all you want, but it will always still be a turd. 

DO NOT BUY into this money making, gambling scheme. The Career is boring, crashes constantly and has no real risk or reward system."
13714,"Stop buying this game. I’m not coming back to this game until they get rid of pay to win, cheaters, and the gambling aspects."
13715,"it´s just like 2k19 but worse. controls are wonky af, more microtransactions, park looks like sh*t. DONT BUY"
13716,"I can understand why so many people complains about 2k20... cuz at the start you have no badges at all and rly bad. but if you just get over that little hump its so fun. 2k20 is much better than 19 - 18. much of the gameplay is the same but you can tell that they have changed some details :) i recomend this game if you like basketball 8/10 would play agian. 
wait for sale"
13717,All hope is lost
13718,"This game is garbage.... it's the same game with a different story. The mynba2k20 is also a garbage app that does not work. Please save time and money by avoiding this game completely.

Hi to be honest this career mode was not as good as the 2k17 one i liked playing for team USA and the 2k19 g league concept was cool too this year there is nothing new same old stuff some new badges. U get gymrat for winning championship and that way you get perma boost which is +4 to all your speed vertical stamina etc.

This year some overrated actors are there to make a baseless story even more boring than it was. Watch some YT u can judge for yourself.

Park is even more cancer. if you are on PC (obviously) realize this YOU CANT PLAY PAST !:30AM there is noone around and this game only comes to life around 7pm-1:30pm

Do enjoy the teams that will be looking for you. this year park is taking noob crushing to the next level if u are below basically 85 you are easy pickings unless you go a big man build then use post moves

ALSO no MYPLAYER Nations?? SRSLY? you guys are a cheap corporation 2k"
13719,"nevermind it's good and Im looking forward to the new game aswell. 

~MrMarc :)"
13720,"Apparently the last name ""Icehart,"" is considered offensive. Therefore, my last name isn't displayed on MyPlayer.

Good job Ronnie. Great game 10/10."
13721,The game crashed in both of my first games. There's gambling mechanic everywhere. the core gameplay didn't have any substantial improvements. they didn't even bother to change the logo from the last year. what more can i say?
13722,"Just don't.
Already refunded."
13723,This casino simulator is literally unplayable. So many bugs and trash gameplay to go along with it. Ronnie fix your game you fucking bum
13724,"The game is terrible.  There is nothing else to say. If you actually like Basket ball, and follow basket ball you will find this game terrible. Here are the reason why : 

First of, it is a PAY TO WIN. There is no argument against that. The progression is as slow as it get. Your player enters the NBA with a rating of ... 60. There not even one rookie in the last 10 years that has entered his NBA rookie year with a rating lower than 70. That game literrally sees you as a living walking wallet. 

Right now player is at 80 (I payed with the game money to try out), and it barely feels any different. My point guard is slowwwww. He is so slow I sometimes dont have the time to come back in defence before the AI can score. It is THAT BAD. Your player feels like he ate 18 triple baconator before the game, and needs rehab therapy for both his knees. 

The Dunks. Seriously, I made a Slasher. He litterally did not start dunking before 79 of rating. Like a little mongrel handicaped kid that  discovered his own ability to jump around 27yo old. 

The Story. I truly fell asleep during one of the cutscene. It must have lasted for something like 20 minute of useless boring drama. And you got these cutscene during the whole career. 

The other reviews : All the positive review you can whatch saying that ""the negative reviews are just from people that dont know how to play the game"" ? All those reviews come from the kind of cuuunt everyone hates. The kind that are not good at playing, but rather, that have abandonned all sense of dignity, and started accepting the game was bad and scripted and finish with the foots. 


The robbery: During the story at the beginning, your player really feels great. He is super fast, strong, precise. You tell yourself, ""damn finally that game actually made an effort making it all feel realistic ! The truth is, its all for hooking you on the game, caus as soon as you start playing in NBA, the game will feel as slughing as it gets, even worst that 2k19. 

To conclude I would say I got HIV playing this game. It was not a pleasure to play, and I hate myself every second that pass for giving again my money to a company that does not listen the negative review it gets. I wish a lot of bad thing to all the developpers that where involved and I will return pukin' blood now. As you read this review, I have probably ended my own life and the life of everyone I love and care about. Also that game SUCKS. Thank you for you attention. Farewell."
13725,"It's the same one game as 2K18 and 2K19 was!!! The same one graphics, microtransactions and f@@g VC, bunch of stupid bugs from previous seasons, face scanner wich doesn't work propely and create freaks, annoying gamplay! What did you do all this year 2K? Don't buy it! Shame on 2K!!!

Update: Now game doesn't work at all. This piece of shit trying to update but nothing for a hour!!!! WTF! I even can't launch it. 2K denied my request for refund for this f*****g fake game. F@@@K swindlers from 2K!"
13726,It is not that bad in my perspective. Atlought it is a really similar game to 2k19 but i think there are some improvements tho.
13727,Very Bad game dont buy it and dont even think about purchasing it.
13728,@Ronnie2k，Where is the previously promised option of changing the dominant competition at any time?If all of guys working in 2K like you are the humble person， PLZ don't let us see you in the game.
13729,its too lag to play online in the philippines.
13730,"AFTER THEY LOWER THE PRICE AND MORE PLAYER COME IN, THE ONLINE LAGS EVERY 10 SECONDS (after they lower the price and more player come in, also in other consoles same problem)! THE SERVERS ARE 0! I FAKING HATE IT'S GETTING WROST THAN DAY ONE
Mycareer:
Shoutout to the b!tches Pg that NEVER pass the ball untill the match is over and they shoot bellow 30% more shoots than the rest of team, they can iso some times NOT EVERY TIME PASS THE BALL!!!!! (90% rec center guards)
more problems with crashes (more than 2k19 and previous 2k) and hackers (a game with years of hackers being a problem)
More unstable scoring % with NO reason behind it xD You can take wide open shots: one match you r kobe and other you bricking everything (if not perfect both), how's that mean this is a good game if i HAVE to take green shots every game??? You don't know if you r doing a great or bad defence xD that's insane! This game is unstable AS F****
THE F**** BUILDS CHANGES EVERY UPDATE! Dunno how the fuck this game works! 64ovr big man hitting 3s (not all perfect), Slashers dunk on 7' with no problem, jump for block is very fast anyone can jump 2 times before a shot goes off,bots at online are OP they can read every hook and every shot taken, hackers everywhere and some B1tches want to play with them, I hate to see ads like Kia this late after release and the servers not even fixed not a single anti-cheat programm f**** u doing for this game? 
Myteam: 
dafuq is this out of position? xD who ever grind for them its easy win, they patched the name under the control player on defence (before u would c the username now player namewith a small delay) SO THAT N00BS CAN PLAY OFF BALL!!!!!
nba 2k21 will be the first nba game i will not buy first day or even month of release!"
13731,"WTF!
Congratulations 2K  you ruined the MyGM Mode.
   Who had this Stupid idea with the AP?  Why do i need Aktion Points in oreder to do somthing? Did i mist the last time a NBA GM said on TV that he can´t go to the Game because he has no AP left? Come on, this is BS. Also  why am i forced to play 6 minute quarters? 

I´m not gonna try the other modes because i want to get my money back. Maybe I will keep playing 2k19.

Anyone who has NBA 2k18 or 2k19, DON´T BUY THIS GAME! KEEP PLAYING THE OLD ONES.

This PIECE OF S*** GAME is not worth the money."
13732,"I think the game is great,if you like nba you should get it. Even though people hate on it they stil play it and tbh just want to be a part of the hate group."
13733,its a no for me
13734,every time i skip to next time my character is on the court.. it dosnt skip and gets played in slow motion FYI
13735,"Same bullsh** like last year, at the beginning if u wonna have fun you have to buy vc or grind 30 hours without any fun, cause you dont hit anything and yout teammates are not even able to score infront of the basket alone after you passed the ball to them. before you get drafted you get a glimps of what the game will be cause there you hit and play normal and its fun. last game of 2k for me

update after 20h of playin this crap:
even worse then i thought, hitting any shots even with big guys alone in front of the rim is pure luck if u dont hit the green, opponments (AI) glitching through your body to score, blocked shots from guys who are 2 meters away from the ball with their arms, could go on with this list as long as u want, this isnt an AAA game, this is just bad, real bad"
13736,"Hello,

Do me a favor and do yourself a favor and dont buy this crap nba2k20 game.

Input lag online is horrible, offline it is also felt. The game plays like the shitty nba2k19 with a slightly adjusted defensive AI awareness so that the AI defense sticks to you like shit but not as much as 2k19. the playcalling and online team selection the shit is similar to 2k19, which means the playcalling is not back to the 2k18 easy to handle menu and easy to call a play, and you cant play with 1 team online you need to play with different tiers to advance which means you cant have a favourite team. which means if your favourite real life team is a tier 3 team you get to play them only once every 5 games. anyway this is not the issue, the issue is input lag that is horrible enough to make you want to crash your computer. 
gameplay feels like the game is playing by itself without you contributing to anything.

good luck wasting 50 euros. 

nba21k18 is the best, i played 1300 hours.
nba2k19 i played only 2 games and stopped
nba2k20 similar to 2k19, a waste of money... i promised myself not to buy before asking couple of guys who played it but then i was wrong again fuck you ronnie 2k turning nba2k into a piece of shit scam to collect money"
13737,"garbage !!!!!!!!!!!!
Wasted my money !!!!!!!!"
13738,"Well there is a little improvement in both graphic and gameplay. The main story of the my career is Good but short . I have not gotten any slowdown glitch when siming in my player career. My gm has been downgraded a little.I don't play my team mode. if you have 2k19 and like playing offline don't bother but if you are a basket ball fan and play online then go ahead, it is really just a polish 2k19 but a Good polish.
But i will advice to wait on a price cut on this game if u really not sure about the game because it doesn't do anything spectacular from 2k19"
13739,"Probably the best sports game out there.. But without anti-cheat .. I can't give it a thumbs up, since PC gets the middle finger. I enjoy the other modes more than multiplayer which is unfortunate."
13740,"Wow. 

So, let me just start off by saying, I really don't care at all for the MyCareer/MyTeam aspects of this (anymore) thanks to 2K monetizing it and making it grindy (not to mention the cringe-worthy storylines and dialog). My bread and butter is really MyGM mode. MyLeague would be my preferred option, except every 2K for the last several years has bare-boned MyLeague in favor of MyGM, leaving out crucial features like morale changes (I benched Russ the entire first half of this season to test for instance, and his morale didn't drop one bit in MyLeague), not to mention other features such as badges on staff and other aspects. So really, there is no ""perfect"" mode for me, thanks to how 2K has broken these modes apart.


Anyway, so the last several years I've been playing MyGM, because with all its flaws, it's still at the best experience available (unfortunately). 2K19's MyGM was actually fairly decent, it gave us most of the options available in MyLeague, while still retaining its own feel. It was fine. Apparently that wasn't going to fly with 2K.

So fast-forward to 2K20. MyGM has been bastardized and is TOTAL GARBAGE. Gone is the ability to edit your players -- AT ALL. Want to change Ben Simmons from a PG to a SF? Can't do it. Want to make AD a PF instead of Center since LA already has Boogie and Dwight at Center? Nope, not anymore.

The entire ""edit player"" option is gone in MyGM. You can no longer edit a player's number (so now if a goofy new player comes to OKC and takes #0, well, even though it's unrealistic, you're stuck with it). You can no longer designate a player as a playmaker in the edit settings. You can no longer edit their accessories. You can no longer do ANYTHING we could previously do in those settings in other iterations -- it's totally gone. I get removing the ability to edit other teams players, admittedly there were ways to really cheese the system last year, such as changing other teams' players that you wanted to crazy positions (like Andre Drummond as a PG) in order to make them tradeable, so if they had removed the ability to edit other teams' players, I would be ok with that. But you are telling me as a GM, I can't change the positions of my own players to evolve with my team? What?!


On top of that, you can no longer use a custom roster anymore. Honestly, I wouldn't care much about this personally, the only reason I use it is because 2K still lists KD as 6'9, despite the fact he is clearly not and has admitted so himself, so it looks goofy seeing him next to Giannis who is 2"" taller than him in the game, even though they are the same height in real life. 


Also, another HUGE missing feature, is that I can no longer set the quarter length, or sim the games I play to have realistic minutes and stats, so now everything is off if I decide to play my own games (which if you don't, what is even the point of playing?). Why was this removed? It makes no damn sense. We can no longer make any other difficulty edits, other than a generic (and totally vague and unhelpful) option to select an easy, medium, or hard difficulty at the beginning, and that's it. 


And don't even get me started on the new ""action point"" system. I still don't understand it, and it still makes no sense, but I can already tell it's awful. Apparently, you have to do something every single day if you want to be able to even play a game -- I can't even just fucking select a game to play on the calendar anymore, it won't let me. I have to do BS tasks and other things each day just to advance. The NBA season is long! I don't want to literally do hundreds of things that are mostly meaningless every season just to be able to play games I want to play. 


There's a lot of other things I am forgetting in the heat of the moment, and I may come back and edit this as I remember/discover more. 

But the main takeaway is that this game has been severely stripped down from the MyGM aspect, to the point that it is pretty much unplayable. Again, none of this would be an issue if MyLeague were given the same basic features and systems that MyGM has, such as working player morale, coaching badges, a feeling that players actually care what you do, etc, but that has been neglected for years by 2K. I suspect it's because they want people playing only modes which include options to spend VC, and if you can customize the game mode to make the league how you want it, how are they going to get money out of you? 

This game is really gross. I'm going to give MyGM a while longer, but I may legit ask for a refund. I keep asking myself ""why"" throughout my experience with this game. MyGM was fixed and fine last year, WHY did they strip it down and make it so restrictive? Restrictive and prohibitive is the best way to describe it. 

I won't be buying 2K next year. I'll wait until a decent version is cracked, and then just grab it that way. I don't care for any of the online BS because it's already been turned into a grindfest in order to milk money out of people for a game they already paid for, so in my eyes 2K did this to themselves. What a gross and disgusting company. 

Stay away from this game. 


Also, as I saw a few other people mention, this is literally such a copy-paste of 2K19, that as of this moment, the icon in the task bar when it's running still shows the 2K19 version. LMAO"
13741,"Hello, I preordered game. When opening game I need to registerd my account, agree terms and so on. And when I got page to agree with sening news to email I can't push anything. Can't select agree, can select decline, can't do anything. 0 reaction. Tried with mouse, keybord, joystick. Tried restart game/pc. Tried to reisntal game and same! Can't even reach menu of game!"
13742,eh
13743,"Terribly optimized. Can't hold a steady 30fps at 720 with high graphics, but jumps around from 60 all the way down to 12 while in game. Runs at 24fps while staring at the main menu screen which just makes no sense to me. Green screen flashes during cut scenes then pops in like nothing happened. Cut scenes run at sub 20fps. This game needs a patch desperately."
13744,Great game if you're into the My Career mode. I really enjoy it. I dont play online so cant comment on that part. The way the game plays feels realistic and i like how you really feel as though you are at the game.
13745,"I guess it really is that hard to make a good basketball game. I question if Take Two could actually make a good one if they didn't spend so much time and effort on marketing and making the game pay to win. 

I didn't buy the 100$ preorder, therefore my mycareer player has to be worse than the worst G-League players but somehow got drafted first round. I'm sure if i shelled out that extra $$$ I would actually feel like a rookie with potential instead of a fat old dude at the neighborhood park trying to play with NBA stars. 

Please Take Two just go $@#% off and take your money grubbing practices to mobile gaming where the pay to win stuff should at least fit in. 

NBA2k always has people buy it but then is downrated to hell cause we hope for a good basketball game and they feed us this bull*&#@ year after year. Between NBA live and this dumpster fire I fear for the next time we will actually get a good basketball game that's consumer friendly. 

The basketball itself is good *most* of the time. Some 2k jank still, but it's better than last year for sure. If you're here for the basketball this game isn't made for you, if you have extra income to spare this game is definitely made for you."
13746,"This game is unplayable, I have a very good computer but the screen flashes every time I try to load into mycareer... Broke trash game, f*ck you 2k you money hungry pricks"
13747,totally a trash
13748,"Classic PC NBA 2k reviews, microtransactions can totally be avoided.  Game is a solid upgrade to last yeasr installment.  My PC seems to handle it a lot better getting FPS rates of 80-100 where last year would dip below 60."
13749,"Serious question. Is anyone else having issues with the game being laggy only during gameplay. I mean, cut scenes are smooth, as is everything else. The only issue is that whenever I'm playing, its super slow.  And thats not to mention how i'm getting green screens that go away after a few seconds. I feel like these are all bugs, I could be wrong, but until then, I wouldnt recommend this game"
13750,"shows as NBA2K19 icon in task bar. :thinking:

(not even joking btw...)

edit: they fixed it 4 days after game release..."
13751,I never thought I would say this but 2k19 is better than this one.
13752,"Shit game, cannot finish NBA games because it crashes before it saves. This issue has been happened in 2k19 and obviously the developers cannot be bothered to fix
"
13753,Honestly love the 2k series but this season people on PC cant even purchase VC from the steam store. So now we are left with a somewhat not done game and cant upgrade our players. Come on Steam and 2K. Enough is enough
13754,Why is there no music when I turn on the game ??? And why is my career stucked right after i finished building my player ??? comon 2K i didnt pay for this crap
13755,"R.I.P. MyGM. 2k19 listened to the MyGM fans by bringing back classic MyGM after the botched 2k18 MyGM Story Mode. 2k just loves to screw up a good thing. Locked quarter minutes at 6 minutes, glitchy leaderboards, terrible generated draft classes, no custom draft classes, broken action points system, no custom difficulty settings, missing textures, missing players, etc. Thank you 2k!"
13756,5 minutes in and im already stuck. cant even play the first match for bay city in mycareer.
13757,"i cant even select an option in the 2k news tab after you make an account. this is ridiculous, i dont know what else to do but refund it."
13758,"Don't buy it, a bunch of things you would unlock by overall is unlocked by playing park now, it's too laggy to actually be enjoyable to play that shit, im really pissed with this"
13759,"This game is far from perfect. Looks great but they changed so many things i loved about 2k19. 

BIGGEST issue is MyGM. BROKEN."
13760,honestly mixed on this game. story was shit its buggy as hell and its pretty much a casino. honestly last years game was better sad to say that. the only thing i like is that they made the game smoother over last years
13761,"You have to understand that 2K is the epitomy of a soulless, late-stage capitalism company and their game entirely reflects that fact. If you take that into account regarding every single aspect of the game then you will never be surprised by anything you may come to encounter in NBA 2K20. If you love or even just like the game of basketball DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. 
Playing online is one thing (cheaters, for example, run rampant without consequence), but even in MyCareer games playing with and against AI players there is no logical consistency in the game. Not only is the AI horrendously badly designed, but the game is entirely dependent on random animations. It is the WORST aspects of RNG based gaming stuffed into a horrid package that has obviously had more resources put into its graphics than any in-game mechanic.

You can call me dramatic, but I honestly think if there was any justice in the world 2K would go bankrupt and every single person who have had any creative control over the game would quit the industry forever and live out the rest of their lives deeply ashamed of themselves."
13762,"From playing I went into many bugs. First, in my career mode I can't simulate to play next while sitting on the bench. When I press to simulate, the game slow down and I can't press any other buttons to simulate it and the game went to slow mode and force me watch the entire game while I'm sitting on the bench. 

The game play for me so far shows the offense has improve, with blow by and making some contest shots, but the defense is so bad. Players can't make contact to push out players trying to cut, and when players are under basket 70% they making the shot even when contested."
13763,"unfortunately, it still a horrible game
 the only thing that matters to 2K is your money.
it's definitely a NBA2K19, but with more bugs and different interface"
13764,"Graphically 2k20 is the same as the last two games, gameplay wise, it's vastly different. The features added in myplayer creation has added flexibility in builds that we previously didn't have. I also thoroughly enjoy the new MyGm mode.

In 2k19 it was practically impossible to drive on a big man, player collision was poorly done resulting in turnovers and frustration. 2K20 has mended this issue and provided the consumer with a more fluid and realistic game. The game itself feels like it has less RNG and provides a more skill based gaming experience (which is very much appreciated honestly).  Overall, pretty good for a NBA2k game."
13765,"There is a lot going on and i understand most people are mad about micro transactions. The way i look at that is if you don't want the experience of starting from the bottom and working your way up then buy some VC. For it to be competitive for myplayer online i can see why people are mad. It doesn't bother me a bit. Now the neighborhood experience its the same exact as 2k19 in my opinion. I don't see the difference at all. It feels a bit clunky running around and the stores really are not that great. I played the Myplayer story and i liked it. Some parts were confusing and didn't really seem like a real players experience to me. Over all good acting and game play. On the court it sometimes feel clunky just like 2k19 but feels faster and more like a basketball simulation. So from playing Madden football and playing this,  NBA2K is by far the better game. Football i love more than anything but this game is a better all around package. If you played madden you know what I'm saying. If you like solo play and just want to work on Myplayer or play franchise mode this game is for you. I also think this game gets a bad rep because there is always so many problems when released. I've even said I'll never pay full price again and haven't for a few years till 2k20. I feel its a great game and the graphics are amazing. I play on a 1080ti with a 5820k at 1440p and this looks like the best game on the market in my opinion. Just know going in its a grind just like all good games. Enjoy the grind. 8.8/10.0"
13766,"it isnt letting me accept the terms...




EDIT: I just had to reinstall and it works fine."
13767,Game keeps crashing in MyCareer. Fix this!
13768,"Hate it or Love it, its always the same, people will complain, train will keep going. Game have + and -. But overall i always love NBA games. Learn to enjoy or learn to skip things that doesnt make you happy. Peace."
13769,"As of right now, the worst 2K ive ever played.

Bought 2k most years since 2k14, this is exactly the same as last year except the following:

They changed the colour of some buildings. (they got rid of foot locker and Jordan rec center, probs didnt pay them and lost the sponsor lmao)

Gameplay feels allot worse that last year IMO. Feels clunky and slugish

MyGM is unplayable.

The menu's look different.



Thats about all the changes from 2k19.

They probs spend all the money for developing a new game on Idris Elbas Paycheque

I rate NBA 2k19.1  - 1/10

Rip my money

EDIT:
Game crashes all the time
There is a bug where if my Mic is turned on and I am in a squad with other people as soon as I speak the whole park freezes and I have to restart 2k"
13770,剛下載完 開的時候一直黑屏怎麼解決
13771,This game is absolutely trash. After playing for years on PS4 I decided to get it on PC since my PS4 stopped working. It was a mistake to buy this game as it’s just the same thing over and over just a roster change with minimal improvements and more and more micro transactions. The my team mode is basically gambling with low pack odds and the new “features” they added in the mode. You have to spend and decent amount of money to have a good overall player unless you would like to grind for a very a long time for your player to be only half decent. Unless you are willing to spend (waste) tons of money for no reason whatsoever then stay far away from this game.
13772,"I have been a 2K fan since I was a kid, that was back in ESPN 2K5. 2K7 was so good that I broke my ps2 because I played too much. Now 2K20, and I've gotta say this game is so bad, even compared to the game play in 2K12, player move like they are drunk and on skates, dunks and lay-ups feel so clunky and unreal, shooting feels so weird, the only thing that is ok is the shooting stick, however, it is so much less responsive compared to previous games. 

Now the WORST part!!!!!!! The connection!!!!!!! I bought this game and still haven't connected to the 2K server yet, all other games are fine, tried everything forums and 2K support told me to do, even reinstalled the game and steam and the WHOLE SYSTEM!!!! still, error code ！！！！！！ I am sick of this game, I didnt buy 2K19 or 18, i thought i missed out, turns out it saved me about 200 bucks. Thanks 2K for ruining the best basketball game."
13773,"Happy release day, 2k! 

Have been playing 2k since 2010, but now I am really done. 

- PS4 Compact Controller works only with Steam overlay open/active and even then, configurations change at will or can't be changed at all. Never happenend before. Almost unplayable. 
- Camera settings switch back to default everytime the MyCareer-Player comes off the bench. 
- After ten years, my real surname is suddenly rated as offensive. I find that hard to understand. 
- Face scan is messed up, but it's like that every year, right?
- Gameplay is so unrealistic that it makes 2k19 look like a milestone of basketball simulation. I don't want to go into the details but trust me, it's horrible. Feels like your player is swimming in a pool of honey, the dribble animations make no sense and the shooting is completely random in terms of release and success. 
- The new archetype system is just as limited and bad as the old one, just with a new outfit. Window dressing.
- Literally NOTHING has been improved, instead, the game is more messed up than ever before. How hard can it be to release a game which at least works in the most basic areas? Espcially when you have made endless amounts of money off of older games. This is a slap in the face of any basketball fan out there."
13774,The worst AI in the 2K history.
13775,"So i buy this game every year and always have my expectations very low but this year they seem to go below and just flat out disappoint. The MyCareer story is much improved than the last few years where they were a cringe fest and you just wanted lil tay to pull a vic and die. Gameplay is much improved than the last few years aswell. But these two positives don't excuse the amount of copy and paste they did and it feels like i purchased an upgraded 2k19 where they just added minor changes to the buildings in the park and just threw in some new shirts and called it a new game and it honestly comes off as lazy. I've experienced only one bug so far were my name isn't on my jersey, to some this isn't the least of there problems as they can't even get into the game as their game just says f u and crashes."
13776,"Game is unplayable, mycareer cannot load, stops at 30% or 43%"
13777,"2K19=2K20. Same game, same graphics, same gameplay, SAME MICROTRANSACTIONS. It is my fault for buying the game once again, and it is the last time I make the same mistake. The archetypes were bad, but the pie charts are even worse, much less room for customization. The MyPlayer has never been as limited as it is in this game.
Do not pick up unless it is on sale for 5$ and you only intend to play offline."
13778,"FULL OF HACKERS CAN NOT ENJOY PARK AT ALL. I BEAT HACKERS AND THEY COME BACK AROUND LIKE I HACK smh. I will continue to fill this list up and comment the names of the hackers you come across so i can add them to the list. TOP REP IS ALL HACKERS

13779,"Anyone who says this game is the same as 2k19 is completely wrong, its 100 times worse. 

Pros:
- updated rosters

Cons:
- The movement is soooooo slow at some parts but also way to fast at other parts
- Dribble moves are ruined
- So many fouls
- Movement feels so bad its hard to even play the game
- I can't play myplayer cause the game is broken
- My opponent disconnects and I don't get a win
- So many microtransactions"
13780,"Is it only me or every time a new 2k comes out on PC, the game is always so laggy and slow for the first few week."
13781,"I'm pretty sure there are people writing negative comments without actually having tested the game properly. This is an awesome basketball videogame, great graphics and an enhanced MyPlayer builder. MyTeam has enough offline options to keep you busy for a fair amount of months. MyGM and MyLeague are back and you even have a fully featured WNBA season! come on guys, drop the hate and try to have some fun with the game!"
13782,"Can't even play MyCareer, I just sit on the sideline and watch my team in slowmo."
13783,"This game is unplayable.
My career is a mess, the story is too short and I can't sim until next subtitution. Instead of simming until i get subbed in, the game becomes slow motion.
"
13784,"A big fat W!
Graphics are fantastic for a sports game,  there is a big improvement when you compare it with NBA 2K19. 
There is a better my player builder,  a better menu, the game in general is a lot better than the previous year! A
"
13785,Alt + F4 simulator
13786,"Total improvement over the last few 2Ks. I play mostly MyCareer, and while you still can't really create a unique player, you have a lot of wiggle room when it comes to customising your player. It's not perfect, but surely a step in the right direction, I really like it."
13787,"Corrupt company DON'T BUY THE GAME GETS MORE BASIC

This Company is the worst, rivals EA and Bethesda hard"
13788,Last years game with some polish.
13789,"Great game and shouldnt be getting so much hate, as a basketball fan this game is a absolute blast. It looks fantastic on pc and I dont really see any huge problems with the micro transactions. This game is light years better than 2k19 in my opinion so if your a basketball fan like me on pc then dont be afrade to purchase this title"
13790,"2K keeps getting rid of features and replacing them with gambling mechanics. Pay to win, loot boxes, and a straight up casino in a $60 game. While for some reason they get rid of Release timing (Normal, Quick, etc.) in rosters... Sometimes I wonder if 2K is actually a money laundering scheme.🤔"
13791,2K Fix this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13792,"Online gameplay is simply terrible. 

Anyone can blow by the defense and score. No skill needed at all.

Last year the gameplay wasn't great but holy cow, this is something else."
13793,"I sadly cannot recommend this game at this time. 
The game makers should be embarrassed. 
Steam should be embarrassed they sold this crap. 
Right now, in its current state, the game is not at all playable. 

The first thing you notice is it takes forever just to connect after you download. 

When you get into the game, even on my 4K computer, it runs with latency. 
At 4k resolution, the game will not let you run faster than 30 mhz refresh rate. 
At 60 mhz and at about half resolution, the frame rate is terrible even on low settings. 
The game videos do not play but instead give you a choppy green screen. 
If you get passed all that and can get to MyPlayer and make a character, you'll find more issues. 
The menus do not always work. Especially when simply trying to exit. Hit A. Nothing happens. You have to minimize and then close the application and restart. 
So you're building a player. Sometimes it will let you choose what he looks like and sometimes it'll just send you straight to ability making. 
After you choose your position, your ratings for various stats, etc, and you save your player, when you go to load it, you will something else. Like I made a Shooting Guard that can Slash to the basket. I ended up with a Small Forward with a different ability. I made a center playmaker and ended up with a Center paint defender.  
With my center, I was shooting deep 3's and did not miss a single shot. On either player I created, I did not miss a shot. I did not play very many minutes, but still did not miss a shot in maybe a dozen or more attempts. 

After all of this, I decided to ask for a refund, so unaware of what other problems there lies in other modes of the game or further along in a game or in MyStory mode beyond a few minutes. I am sure there are other issues. 

This has been my experience with this product."
13794,10/10 if you're just playing like mycareer as long as it's not online.
13795,can't open the game ! stuck on blank screen.
13796,"Very bad and broken game in so many ways! 

Just a few thing i noticed after 90 minutes of playing.... 

-I'm playing only MyGM and first thing i notice is 6 minutes quarter length without ability to change it (if i overlook that setting somewhere - my apologies). I played one game, which is finished 79-72, someone who is a fan of very old NBA or current European leagues will probably enjoy result like this. I can't find it very attractive or (to be honest) realistic in today's NBA game. I'm not sure what developers tried to do with this but it didn't helped the game at all. Absence of one of most common setting parameter is bad bad move!

- Game didn't let me to play first game of the season, it just skipped to second one - very odd..

- While creating MyGM character, game founded my last name inappropriate and didn't let me continue until i changed it. My last name is Vorkapic, so i dare everyone to find what is so inappropriate in my last name.... 

I'll ask for refund and re-install NBA 2k19 if nothing else, there i can enjoy length quarter longer than 6 minutes...."
13797,"Okey this game is really full of bugs cant even play on low graphics (btw i have way better pc than requirments )actually that game is joke but joke for 49,99 USD
full of lootboxes and other microtransactions 
i think its not worth it even if they will repair bugs bcs of pay to win

i am giving 0,5 from 10"
13798,worst fucking game
13799,Destroyed MyGm good job 2k
13800,My Career is epic...worth the money...i highly recommend this game...
13801,"You can play using a keyboard on pc, but still finds itself lacking on proper key display. Specially on My career mode where various keys are needed to be used, it only shows what to press if you are using a console controller, no support for keyboard users. Plus I encounter a problem where I finished the story in my career mode and I'm on the start of the 2019-2020 NBA season, only to find out that my player has no name. It's blank and it is pretty annoying. I tried using the 2k19 trick to change my player name but it doesn't work anymore. So all in all, I can't recommend playing this game yet with all the problems or lack of support thereof."
13802,"Had a potato at time of release - a few months later and I upgraded to a Ryzen 3700x / RTX 2070 Super and have had zero issues running this game. Frankly, at this point it plays quite well at the end of its update cycle. Definitely recommend - 2K20 is very capable of creating high quality basketball moments on the court."
13803,Game is better now but in MyCareer there is a bug so you can't skip ahead in a match while you are on the bench. Its stupid.
13804,Crashed a lot. Can't even play
13805,"servers fucked on day one, my player got hit with the no name glitch, many of the interfaces are the same as last year

just a trash refresh game if I’m being honest"
13806,"way too epic gamers, this game costs at least $110 to play mycareer which is epic."
13807,"2k15=2k16=2k17=2k18=2k19=2k20 Ahhhh shit, here we go again*6
plz 2K kill urself ty monkaS"
13808,fix your game 2k cant even play on low graphics
13809,What an unfinished version of this game. I have to regret buy this n pc because first of all there already lots of bug that have nothing to do with the game itself. Load up my career mode and Im having this green screen where Im seeing just green color. I met the recommended pc spec requirement and using gtx 1060 gb graphics card with 16gb of ram and i7 cpu. What a joke on this version and I wish I can refund this.
13810,"Already refunded this game. I haven't played since 2k15, so I thought that even though people are saying it is the same game, that enough time had passed for me to enjoy some new things. I tried 20 times to upload a face scan using their absolute garbage app that also forced me into some card game and made me click through 20 store pop-ups and complete the game in order to go back to the menu (even force quitting the app brings you back to the card game when you reopen). 

Every time I uploaded my face scan, it would say error and then make me do another face scan. I got sick of it not working, so I created a player based off a face in the game. During the customization, it skips a bunch of things I would want to change, and locks in a semi-customized player. I played career mode for 20 minutes and cringed and found myself skipping the cutscenes since they were so cheesy and obvious. 

I thought I would delete my career and try again today for making a player. I deleted my career, and when I went to start a new career, it had that same semi-customized player locked in without any way for me to make a new player or change the appearance. 

All of that, on top of players pictures showing them in their old jerseys when this game released 3 months after the trade happened. Lazy game that from what I played, seemed clunkier than 2k15 and is full of dumb stuff they didn't even bother to check."
13811,"Best one yet!!! DOPEAF
The haters are just that- haters. Do I play MyTeam collector scam game? Of courase not. I play Park, Rec, and Pro Am like a civilized person, and it's great."
13812,"Last one I will be buying. Can't even max out character with 100k VC. This company is almost as bad as EA... Microtransactions everywhere, cannot escape."
13813,"I've played the NBA 2K franchise since 2K5 and this is honestly the 1st time I feel like the game is broken and should've not came out. Game is too slow, defense is horrendous, stamina runs out soooo fast, triple threat offline doesn't work, there isn't custom pie charts in my career, my team offline content is awful, feels like a casino with some basketball in my team. I have no idea how 2K has taken this many step backs from previous iterations of the game. Utterly disappointing and sad because I thought this year it would be different."
13814,They continue to shit in my face every year. No one at 2k even remotely cares about the consumer anymore. Ronnie is a bum
13815,RTX 2060 + i7 and I cant get 30 fps on medium settings. something is wrong about the optimization
13816,worst nba2k ever .. worst gameplay ever
13817,Piece of shit
13818,"Mechanics feel excellent compared to last season. 

I don't play any other mode other than core NBA teams - it's great for the price.

Not perfect, but a big improvement over last year!"
13819,"It's still the same. Like 2k19. Still buggy. Error code unrecognized.
Don't buy this game if You want to play only offline."
13820,lol havent even played a game and theres already numerous problems great game again
13821,"Garbage copy paste of NBA2K19 with more micro-transactions, trash ass company"
13822,"I don't understand why you cannot set quarter length in My GM mode (at least I don't find it). If it's because of the online ranking thing, that's really stupid (to a degree I understand why they don't let you change difficulty). I believe most people enjoying My GM mode before would not care about how they rank online but rather enjoy their own experience of running a team.

Oh, and if you make a trade on a game day, or talk to a player or anybody, you can't even play the game because it costs action points to play a game? Someone needs to remind TAKE 2 that this is after all a basketball video game, not the basketball version of Football Manager. YOU SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PLAY EVERY SINGLE GAME!

Let's say just I am actually  fine if they copy and paste 2k19 and update the official roster and call it 2K20.  They can't even do that lol."
13823,"I haven't played much of this because i'm getting frustrated with it, i just started my player and my guys on the bench and when it tells u to skip so u can get ur guy in game i press the button and guess what it don't skip so i'm stuck watching the entire quarter or hole game, sometimes in slow motion cuz it glitches the game into slow motion so if u have 12min quarters expect them to be an hr plus i've tried to restart the game same thing happens and u cant quit matches all the time because u don't get any VC points so wth can you do, But i will say the Story is a lot better than NBA 2k19 and the gameplay from what little i have gotten.. But is this a game u should buy... If u don't come across my problem then yeah go for it but if u do u will be hating it so for me i'm saying don't buy just yet. wait a little for some new patches.."
13824,"waste of money it doesnt let me play online, it says i have to sign in but it doesnt even give you an option to do that"
13825,So Many Problems so Quickly.
13826,shit game
13827,"You spend 3-4 hours to create a myplayer...I guess only because you couldn't refund the game after seeing it's game shit like last year, maybe even worse."
13828,"I'm a gambling addict.

13829,"after waiting so long for the game to unpack through the night while i slept, the game has me logged for 5 hours of gameplay which is untrue ,ive only played this game for 20 mins and cringing through the experience. i would like a refund of this game. the only mode i play which s mygm is so downgraded to where the game to me is very unplayable. I hate the fact that 2k is putting so much emphasis into a game mode such as mycareer and totally forgetting about the people who like to play offline instead."
13830,A lot of lag and frame rate dropping happens all the time with this version of NBA in Steam. Fix this 2K!
13831,"2k my team mode sucks ass like always 
fk this mode"
13832,the new mechanics are great! driving in the paint feels really good and the defense is more reactive!
13833,Its lagging fo rme
13834,"Well I downloaded the game opened it up started doing the basic sign up stuff with birth date, email, and then I got to a page that asks you if you would like to receive updates, codes, etc and is can't get past this screen (broken screen, i tried connecting my controller to see if I would be able to press ""A"" to bypass this as well). So can't even access the main menu.."
13835,"You will be better off playing 2k19, this game is way too much slowed down, mycareer is a scam, and myteam isn't even playable in most european countries cause of the gambling laws, i mostly bought this game for offline myleague and mygm, but i dont like the gameplay so i'm trying to refund the game

Also they released this game waay too late for europe, i waiting for like 7 hours before i could Unpack the game -> yes not even play but Unpack for 2 hours, till you can play it pff"
13836,"Game actually feels really nice, Great movement & A fan of the new MyPlayer system. Only problem is microtransactions however, you DONT have to buy them, you can play, invest time & do just as good.

13838,"MyGM is the mode i played most. But now it has no customization and you are forced to play with 6 minutes quarters, no sliders, you can't set difficulty (gameplay) , you can't load individual roster...


This mode is dead for me, thank you 2K! You sacrificed this mode for Multiplayer Leaderboards...What a punch in the face !

Future of Sports Video Game getting darker and darker :-(

This is the fa**ing problem with modern Sports Video Game... 2K act like EA and forgot the old/loyal fanbase who buyed every years NBA2K....I'm done with 2K."
13839,"Having issues with the game. Whenever I 'Sim to appearance' the game glitches out. The game continues playing, but the commentators completely shut off, it does not sim, and after the first quarter finishes and gameplay resumes, literally EVERYTHING is in slow-motion, and then the game crashes."
13840,lying ass bitch ronnie
13841,This game is broken. All cut scenes and videos are blurred by static and the game does not sync to your system and will lag or have frame rate drops regardless of specs. (i play all games on Ultra settings and this game has only slight graphical increases from 2k19. Needs an update fast or needs to get registered with GeForce Experience to be optimized that way. since that option is not yet available it makes this game a giant heap of garbage. Back to ps4 until this trash is fixed smh.
13842,Its Basically 2k19 doesnt deserve the money at all
13843,pls pls dont buy it its trashhhhhh
13844,"Had about 500,000,000 technical fouls in a game in my career. Tried exiting and coming back. Same thing. Just a loop of technical fouls. Been stuck in the 1st half for about an hour."
