7,"Nice survival game, specially in night time :)"
8,One of the funniest experience ever with friends. The love that the developers have put in this game can be truly felt.
9,"very good game, although kinda hard for younger players, also its hard knowing what your suppose to do when you first start playing"
10,"Absolute W of a survival game. I love smashing in the faces of enemies, it is incredibly satisfying to kill the annoying pricks that attack you for no reason."

18,We starved together.
19,The Most Toxic  Communities ever
20,"I love this game to the brim, and it holds a sentimental value so absolutely love it!"
21,Really fun with friends
22,"Lets start off by saying, this certainly is one of my favourite shooter experiences of this year, i have many reasons but no doubt the best thing about this game is the innovative features it brings into the shooter medium, i've played many games like this in the past but none of them have quite caught my eye, the default settings need some tuning, but after you get past that the multiplayer is great, i think the gun mechanics are really great, in my opinion there isn't enough ammo, but thats up to preference. I haven't experienced much lag, which is really important for a game like this, so what can i say besides good job?

Everyone having a lot of hp might deter some players from enjoying the game as much, but its a different unique experience from games like, (for example) Counter Strike. I'd say some of the characters might be a bit overpowered on certain maps but that usually works fine, after all its generally skill vs skill.

Some of the unlockables might take too long to get, and i understand the people who are very dissapointed by this, especially since you can pay to unlock them earlier. The game isn't pay to win, though, which while good is just a standard.

Although some of the weapons, especially the shotguns and automatics can feel a bit frustrating, if you play enough to learn most of the cover mechanics, you can usually learn how to counter them. 

The PVE gamemode is somewhat interesting, with its large upgrade system, somewhat reminds me of the Mann VS Machine gamemode from Team Fortress 2, its not something to play the game FOR, but it certainly can be fun if you bring friends.

Pretty much nobody plays Payload or Capture The Flag, which even though rather unfortunate, i can see the reasoning for, the game feels much more right played in settings such as 1v1 or deathmatch.

Overall, this game is a solid 8/10 for me, the mechanics carry it, despite some of the weaker aspects.
I highly reccomend you to try it for yourself, its something that no person who enjoys shooters should miss."
23,it good
24,best game to play with friends
25,ITS A very fun game!! absolutely recommend it to be played with friends.
26,coop fun
27,it's free and fun for multi-players
28,A great game to learn from your mistakes!
29,"This is a simply amazing game. then again, most games by Klei are. it's very hard, but that's part of the fun. 10/10"
30,"Fun game too run around with group of friends or randos And Die Many Many Times lol

Oo and did i mention sometimes u starve"
31,it gooooooood
32,there is a funny frog.
33,This game is too hard
34,"mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm good
"
35,"One of the best games you will ever play.
Death will be certain, but also your best teacher.
Do not get discouraged by it, but learn from your mistakes and survive next time!
This game has lots of lore, mechanics and amazing quests and adventures that you cannot miss.
From exploring, adventuring, resource gathering, fighting, base building, skins, events. And More!
Klei Entertainment makes free updates basically almost every month, so...
You will get way more than what you are paying for!
Absolutely 100% Recommended."
36,Gaming
37,needs cross platform. Been playing this game for years and by far the most annoying thing is the lack of cross platform. Really makes it hard to play with friends unless EVERYONE can play on the same platform
38,"i can relate


(i cant find food anywhere in my house)"
39,"more dont starve that i get to play with my partner, 9/10"
40,Excellent experience in co-op
41,Have and will always love this game. I've never completed it but have had lots of fun adventures in it.. It's such a thrill!
42,"The game itself is very enjoyable, especially with friends, getting to know the basics and progressing further is a pain tho. Runs can easily take 2 hours and you still die to the hounds or winter and in the next run dont know what to do.
Be prepared to use the wiki a lot."
43,"The game is consistently good, with a content rich world that surprises even after the 40 hour mark. The developers have been actively supporting it for years. 

This is a Classic, by all standards. If you enjoy indie games, it is a ""Must Play"". 

Bravo, encore!"

66,"If you don't have the money to buy both singleplayer Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together, get Don't Starve Together. Though the single-player experience can be a bit odd in Together, it has way more content and you have lots of ways to customise and mod the experience to fit you better"
67,"Great game, don't see any guides or google stuff to actually enjoy the discvoery"
68,"more like ""dont let the detox gremlins kill you"""
69,"Game is meh, look at this instead.

lovin this game so far"
72,"Jeux de survie en solo ou groupe, bonne difficult√© et grand monde √† d√©couvrir !"
73,fun fun!
74,"The amount of fun that you can have in this game is so huge, I think some of the updates over the years have over-complicated the simple formula that made me love DST when I first discovered it but it's still a blast to play especially if you're jumping in with a few friends."
75,"great game, died by hounds,lighting,starving,overheating,hallucinations,pigs,beefalo,spiders,bees,freezing,fire, food poisoning,earthquakes,and lastly frogs. buy this game if you want to get kicked in the balls and have your heart get rip out of your chest and get tap danced on."
76,Amazing game. Turned down most of the monster settings and my previously non-gamer wife and I enjoyed it non-stop for an entire weekend.
77,i starved

79,"There's a bit of a learning curve or I'm just bad at the game. Whatever the case, this game is very fun and my husband and I love playing together."

81,pretty good
82,i love beating up animals
83," its a fun game played it with my brother and dad
"
84,"Terribly boring and slowly paced, zero explanation on how to do anything in the actual game itself showing the devs pure laziness, making the players look up how to do the simplest of things to even slightly progress."
85,This game taught me I don't need friends.
86,"gud gaem, veri diffkult"

114,"I am a 406 yo fat lesbian mother, probably one of the youngest people playing this game. I am a single mother to my uncle, who is 25 now. My son got this game for Penismass in 2012 from his mother, so we installed it on his lapcock and he started wanking. By the end of the day he had 3000 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my big fat greasy balls, as they are always out in public. So I decided to make a Steam account and bake some bread to see if I could maybe play alongside Jeffs' mom. I loaded into the game, came, and started nutting but I was stuck on my huge penis. I asked Joe and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the sexiest time I had spent with my balls since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my closer again and now we actually spend time together  and outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many  and happy and memories."
115,A community made up of people who are quite literally willing to kick players for dying a lot because they're new is just toxic and not worth your time.
116,What can I say the game speaks for it self. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt starve‚Äù story of my life and Now living with my significant other ‚Äúdon‚Äôt starve together‚Äù is chapter two of my life! Great game though!!
117,"a real classic, its kinda hard at first but once you find your way its so fun"

122,great game c:
123,"This game embodies the work smarter, not harder mantra. It's super fun as long as you are vigilant. Also, you can laugh at your friends when they repeatedly die ..... because they weren't paying attention to the dark or their torch or, you know, the many, many enemies you may encounter : )"
124,"This is the perfect game to enjoy with your friends.  I like the cooking feature, and gardening feature."
125,"A lot more fun with decently large groups, still very fun even if its single player.
I need more friends who like this game tbh"
126,"Super interesting game to play with friends. Although it's super challenging at first, but in my opinion that just adds more depth to the game."
127,please don't starve :(
128,"A game aware of what they want their game to feel like. A rich and wonderful world with superior survival game mechanics. A perfect balance of challenging and rewarding. Steam Workshop offers great quality of life mods; though the game does not depend on mods to offer a great experience.  

If you like survival games even a little bit, give this game a chance! You will not be disappointed."

136,.
137,nice
138,"Chaotic, gives you anxiety, but amazing mechanics and a lot of fun to play with friends."
139,"Love the Gothic Victorian charm to the art, and clever text quips from the characters. Can be tough to start depending on how the world turns out (randomized). Great game with friends! 11 out of 10 will purchase as gift for friends."
140,"Be careful trying this game. Once you make it past the initial challenge of survival there is a lot of content to suck you in! Also I highly recommend checking out the shorts about Don't Starve on Klei's Youtube channel, the intriguing lore is part of the reason I love this series.

Very worth playing with friends! Supports up to 6 people or potentially more if you invest in a server.

Also modding support is fantastic, there is many QOL and content mods to shake the game up and improve upon it. Also, Klei themselves have been hard at work updating the game, I'm always eagerly anticipating the next content drop!"
141,"I just like to play ft a friends then after 40 days of game days il just set everything on fire to see how he cryes.
Guud game Frends needed"
142,"10/10 recommend
beat this shit after 100hours"
143,"I remember being excited back in the day to play Don't Starve multiplayer, it was just a wonderful new thing. But DST has grown to be so much more than that, def worth checking out if you're on the fence"
144,starving for more
145,gud stuff.
146,fun. kissed my mate callum. he gifted me the game. i kissed him.
147,It's ok i guess only played it for a little bit though.
148,"I actually tried playing it a couple times, I have never got trough more, than 3 bosses. The game is nice, hard and great. With the Terraria collaboration, I even tried it again, but I guess Im not good at it, or dunno, the game is really complicated and hard for me. Maybe someday, I will finish it, but I dont know actually for sure."

155,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

161,"This is a neat little survival game with a high entry barrier due to a lack of information resources in-game. It's not exactly intuitive at the start, but once you really get going, things start making sense.

also the designs are good so that's that"
162,Great survival game with friends and it has a ton of content to explore. Pretty challenging gameplay with a lot of replay value.
163,"Don't Starve
do that again

good game"
164,I hate rain
165,"die to a cat, a frog or a hairy spider...your choice."
166,"Seems liked a fun game however very little is inherently intuitive and it takes hours of researching on the wiki how to do/craft/define the parameters of what things are. If you got the time to invest in figuring out what the flim flams and quigquams do with the floof stumpf. 
Coming from games like green hell where you dont know what you can craft off the bat but with a little trial and error and hintful creativity you can make the tools needed i appreciate games that challenge you in this sense but dont force you to read a dictionary just to play much less enjoy it.

I'd give it 3.5/5. Only due to the huge turnoff of learning all the random bits which you NEED to know. This game would be much more enjoyable with someone that could explain it all as you go along in order to prevent alt-tabbing every few minutes."
167,so good
168,one of the games Of  all time
169,"its fun and all but since the new update it keeps crashing when i try to load a world

204,fun game for a minute. something different than other games. I starved together.
205,It's crazy how every time i play this game i find out about a feature i had no idea existed and the love and attention shown from all the updates is *chefs kiss*.
206,"My wife bought this for me so that we can play it together. Right now, we play in our own server with just the 2 of us and I have to say that the first few runs were very painful and not enjoyable at all, BUT that quickly changed. The more we learned about the game, the more we played, the longer we got to survive with each run. Teamwork is key here and it's important to gather resources in preparation for the next season (or you're screwed, lol). One of the most enjoyable things about this game is definitely learning new things and building a fort. There's also something very therapeutic about gathering resources - from picking up items from the ground to gathering twigs. I could do all day. I have to say though that each run gets longer and longer. The more you learn, the longer you survive; therefore the longer your runs get. Some of our runs can go for as long as 4 hours. It's actually crazy how addicting this game is. I highly recommend it. If you can run a server with 5 friends, you're gold. Enjoy the game!"
207,Poor experience.  It is easy to die when you enter or leave the under earth world. I dont know what happened. When I loaded and find I was killed by bat or rabbit. terrible experience.
208,"Game makes me cry at times but I love it, I love that the developers still update it regularly and we also got a healthy modding community so if you're looking for something that doesn't hold your hand and lets you learn through trail and error this is it."
209,"A unique take on the survival genre, funner with friends than alone, although can easily be enjoyed alone. If you die the world is reset."
210,good pretty good
211,"Definitely don't play if you get frustrated easily. It is very hard to make progress and the default is perma death (with the exception of a few ways to respawn). But if you can get past that it is incredibly addicting and fun as hell, especially with friends."
212,"this game is amazing and i would recommend for anyone who likes survival games, single player or not, you will have a good time"
213,"It's all hounds
Everywhere I go
it's hounds

10/10 game"
214,"I will always recomend this game in the highest regard to anyone interested in a survival game with lore.

Although I haven't been in the community for this game in a little over 4 years, this game and its singleplayer version have legitimately changed my life forever.

I made so, so many friends and I still have some of them, but the fact that I met them led me down new roads to change and grow and become the person I am today.

I owe you, Klei."
215,"Is nice, and better with friends, any way, this is the hardest survival game that i played !"
216,"Game constantly disconnects in local only mod. Klei servers constantly crash and are completely reset. Private servers, constantly crash and go offline. Klei, fix your game."
217,I starved
218,"yes
yes
yes
yes"
219,"I did the exact opposite of what this game's message is, but its a really good game"
220,I starved
221,"The game is very well made and has both style and substance for those with the patience to master it. That is not me!
 
I can't say I find the ""not starving"" (exploring, scavanging, crafting, fighting, base building) apect all that enjoyable. It's very trial and error with punishing difficulity. That's not really an issue but I wouldn't call it ""fun"" so there's nothing beyond the art and character that keeps me coming back. I love Wurt, her personality and unique perks but that doesn't hold much water in the long-run, sadly...

I don't really enjoy the fundamentals like moment to moment gameplay, paper flat perspective, movement and controls so this isn't a game I will stick with. It feels like a waste of time that can be fun with friends, but any other multiplayer game would be equally or more fun."
222,good game.
223,hehe beefalo
224,"remember don't starve together, starve alone"
225,Excellent game to play with friends.
226,"ITS FUN
"
227,"By the time I'm in the game, almost every other player is a pro. As a beginner, almost every hostile obstacle is hard; the bosses, weird weather events. The skill gap between me and everyone else is just huge. But there's something about overcoming obstacles ending up giving you satisfaction in this game. You have to craft various items and plan ahead for every events as well as seasons. To succeed in doing these, one have to explore the entire map, collecting all the necessary resources. The thing is, the game has no tutorial whatsoever, so you have to learn through harsh and brutal experience. Or, you can find guides available online through youtube or wiki. I mostly depend on the latter, but still I am having hard time surviving past any boss spawn. The greatest aspect of the game though is sharing these experience with friends or good online people. If you play with fellow players it felt like the whole group is going against the world together. The sense of cooperation, doing different things to fulfil each other's need feel just so wholesome. The bad part is, there is a category of bad players called griefers who just sabotage your base and your group. Some of them pretend to be friendly and asking where your base is, and turns out they brought bosses to your base without any of you being ready or just burn everything down. And not everybody is welcoming of other player, making it lonely for me sometimes in my own server cuz I got nobody wants to play with me sometimes. Overall, one of the best game I have ever played. 8/10 rating"
228,"Absolutely stunning, only problem for me is finding the people to play it with, but public servers make up for it"
229,-
230,Really fun I‚Äôve been playing this game for years and I moved to pc to experience mods. Obviously this game is more fun with friends. Don‚Äôt starve isn‚Äôt like other survival games which is what I love about it‚Ä¶ as someone who has all the PlayStation trophies for this wonderful game I definitely recommend it
231,game bagus ada tentaclenya saya suka
232,Port shipwrecked and Hamlet you cowards
233,when i played this game i farted
234,Is good. Very easy to starve together.
235,"By far one of the most expansive games I‚Äôve ever played.  The formula of the game is not difficult, but the execution is flawless and the challenge real.

Game is possible solo, and has a lot of exclusive content and features over the normal single player game‚Ä¶ but get some people who enjoy this Tim Burton-esk survival rogue-like insert-buzzword-here game and it‚Äôs a blast. I‚Äôve not even seen a third of the game probably and I keep trying and would like to think I‚Äôm not bad at it‚Ä¶ but in a few years when I read this I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm going to still say I knew nothing because there‚Äôs so much to discover and learn in this game!!!!"
236,This game is such a casual match 3 game i love matching the items together because it pleasures me
237,"It's very fun, challenging as well. Great game to play with hardworking friends. <3"
238,lots of little creatures
239,COOL
240,"I've put about 30hrs into Don't Starve Together and maybe another 10 into Don't Starve. The game does such a shit job of explaining well... ANYTHING. I get that some of the fun might come from learning but let's be real.. this is not a noob friendly game. Is the draw for most of you that there is secret knowledge that must be obtained through the wiki? Take say.. idk Subnautica or Valheim. Conan Exiles.. ANY other survival crafting game. Things might not be explained in the best way and there are things for you to figure out.. but you can manage just by playing and learning.

In DS/DST I feel like its pretty much a requirement to read the wiki. Like I can't have any sort of progression unless I read a guide/wiki on it. Its to the point where the game might as well just have the wiki in an in-game browser. Everything is just so obscure and maybe that's a huge draw for others and i'm probably in the minority here because the game has such great reviews and everyone seems to love it, etc etc.. but when does the game actually become fun? is the fun just reading the wiki and/or doing what guides say to do? If so.. why? why would having to follow a guide and do exactly what it wants you to do be fun? The game feels like work and that's about it. I guess it just isn't clicking for me.

The tim burton-esque art style is what drew me in to this game and I want to like it but I just seem to not be able to. I'd say i've given it a very fair try with around 40hrs and have played with friends, etc.. but really.. WHAT is it about this game that everyone seems to love?

ALSO: The combat is downright atrocious.. if you can even call it combat. Kiting is the only way of fighting? who thought that was a good idea? Sure you could just stand there and fight like normal with armor on, but to do that would be gimping yourself."
241,My playtime looks short but I have played about 12.8 hours counting the original Don't Starve and I have learned that you die a lot in this game. It's fun playing with people online and it's worth trying out if you like survival games
242,GOOD
243,Add achievements pls
244,play it all the time at work very good :)

253,love this game to death
254,good when play with friends
255,Fun coop experience
256,"I love this game. It's all about surviving and there's A LOT to experience and explore.

However, It's definitely not for everyone as I have few friends who actually like this game...."
257,I starved false advertising but funny chest mouth was funny so I ain't complaining
258,"its good, dont know how my buddy eric has 500 hours on it"
259,it reminds me of when my parents drove me out in the middle of the woods and left me there
260,Very fun and super addicting. Something for everyone to do!

262,"This is an amazing game, just be aware that default settings include perma death. but you can change it in settings."
263,i dont remember this game [-:
264,"I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently downloaded Don't Starve Together and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
265,Tencent moment
266,Good Game
267,its a nice game i like art stile and ways to play
268,"the game lives up to its premise

just dont starve"
269,"A wonderful game. Great visuals, music, and game play. Very easy to customize, super friendly to mods, and the community is rich. if you like survival craft games with unique bosses, characters, and other creatures then this game is for you!"
270,"This game is so amazing! a category by itself! First day playing it and already spent 7 hours exploring what I believe to be tiny bits of the game. 
Can't wait for the next run."
271,"This game is very epic (YIPEEEE) I like it (YIPEEEEEEEEE)
(YAWHOOOOOOOOO) Play this game (RAUGHH) or else (MEOOW)"
272,"Awesome multiplayer. Really, the gold standard."
273,bewwy good
274,"Why are you starving?



The game told you not to starve.




So don't starve."
275,You will die.

287,I always used to play this game as a kid. Its probably the best survival game there is and I highly recommend to anyone who likes survival games. Ive only really enjoyed this game being played with other people never solo because im not really into survival games. To summarise this game is best in survival gerene. However I only enjoy playing maltiplayer.
288,i love this game its my addiction someone help me
289,Scavenge the things to make the meatball and then you cook the meatball and then you eat the meatball and then you crave the meatball in real life and then you order meatball from local pizza restaurant and then you eat the meatball in real life and forget to eat the meatball in the game and then you die in the game and then you die in real life. And then it is The end.

I play it once a week with four friends and it's always a delight. One day we might even tackle Fuelweaver!"

330,CX
331,"I probably have 200-240 hour gameplay with uhh ""not legalized version"" of the game. You'll have A LOT of fun with watching your friends starve while you're eating all the food, that's me."
332,I enjoy playing this game
333,incomprehensible death and despair
334,"The game is hard at first, but the more you play, and more experienced/longer u survive, the more fun it becomes. I do recommend mods, but only after you have played through at least maybe in game days, regardless of if those days were all spent on one or 20 worlds. Really fun, and its survival aspect is done really well."
335,good
336,good
337,"i played this game with a friend of mine a few years ago when the Return Of Them update was first being released and he spawned about 100 pig houses, punched one of the pigs and they all immediately ganged up on us and killed us within like 3 seconds flat. did feel strave, was fun, Wilson will always be a sexyman in my book"
338,"Eh, it's fine"
339,its ok
340,I ate.

342,good
343,I just don't get it. I played with friends and its still boring.
344,"It's a fun game to play, quite challenging but isn't hard to play for beginners!
Beginner Friendly :D

Would be fun if you got friends to play with"
345,"'tis fun
"
346,"I absolutely love the artwork in this game. I love the features, mechanics and the characters. The story line for this game is kinda cute too. I like that there are multiple scenarios, and things to do inside of the game. I would recommend playing this game with friends, it is rather hard to accomplish on your own if you are a new player."

348,.
349,challenging but fun - tutorials help a lot
350,Difficult but i love it
351,Pretty fun game with mods <3
352,"I freaking love this game, I got it pretty recently and I already have 38 hours in it, and I've only killed 5 bosses! There's so much fun to come and I am so excited
"
353,"Let me start off by saying while I love this game with all my heart, it's definitely not for everyone. It's not very beginner friendly for starters. It has no tutorial whatsoever and throws you in blindly to figure the mechanics out for yourself. If you're someone who doesn't enjoy using trial and error to figure out what you're supposed to do, or if you don't like the idea of needing a guide to survive your first year, this game is not for you. But those who get past the learning curve will find hours of enjoyment. 
You will find something new at every corner of the world. Tons of replayability. You will definitely get your money's worth. You'll never find yourself stuck on what to do next, because the game is always throwing things your way to keep you on your toes. There's always something to prepare for, whether its a boss being thrown your way, the harsh winters, springs, and summers, or the inevitable moment when you run out of food. 
This game definitely comes with a challenge, but don't fear if you're a player who likes to take it easy. The settings allow you to disable basically anything you want. Disable nighttime, certain seasons, certain enemies, bosses, literally anything you can think of. You can make your own fun!
Though this game is meant for multiplayer I wouldn't let that stop you if you just wanted to play on your own. Since the original singleplayer Don't Starve stopped being updated, I would still push DST your way instead since you can easily make your own private singleplayer worlds here too.
If you're a fan of survival games I could not recommend Don't Starve Together enough. 100 stars out of 10. DEFINITELY worth the price."
354,"I like how wormwood eats shit
Pretty good"
355,"very   coolll and    gud

Do you have friends?

Yes: You will have fun!
No: You will have fun, just a bit lonely!

It's worth the money!!
"
361,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

363,"shitty steam deck configuration, can't turn off controller potions and turn on keyboard and mouse"
364,"I don't know what to do
7,5/10"
365,So even after playing this game for 45 hours i feel like i have barely even experienced the game wich is why i like this game its hard its fun and very long i mean i havent even beaten a miniboss yet. So after ive survived a year ill probably add way more to this review but thats probably after surviving a real life year though. And it being hard isnt bad thing about the game its the GOOD thing about the game. So far i recommend it
366,"bruhh lit game
"
367,i starved :(
368,"Professional tip: Whatever you do, do not starve at all. You'll thank me later."
369,"Such a classic game that is great to find out how well you work together with friends! Characters are charming, creatures are creative, and you can choose to have a relaxing or stressful play through. Love the fact you can customize the world to create a more peaceful or intense experience to fit your play style, game knowledge, and provide experimentation on how other mechanics within the game work. Only thing I would like to see in future updates (or DLC) is the ability to create your own character for this survival game. Either way, this is a great game to try out if you are new to PC gaming or a long time PC gamer that everyone should have in their library."
370,I starved multiple times.
371,Ironically did a lot of starving. 10/10 would die again.
372,"Game is very difficult at first but when you get the hang of it, it will be fun. Game fun with friends, don't get attach to your pet, sometimes we gotta do what we gotta do to survive"
373,"Super fun to play with friends, especially if you get accustomed to the game and decide to use mods. Take your time cause there is plenty to learn and the game gives you no hints so use youtube when needed."
374,"you rlly gotta spend some time learning about the game mechanics, wont last long for casual playtroughs, but probably will be very enjoyable if you plan on playing that way.
great."
375,BEST GAME EVER
376,W
377,"if you die in dont starve, you die in real life"
378,"if you like replayability then this game is for you.

you'll also feel like every death was your fault 100% of the time"
379,"Here's it in a nutshell. I liked it, it has a lot of good features and items but how it runs is like a Bethesda game on life support, it's awful. 

In the short of it, Klei's attempts to try to polish out frame rate instead makes it a laggy mess. I have various other complaints but there more petty then anything else.

Would i suggest it? I like it and it's good, but unless Klei fixes the lag problems i cannot do so."
380,Cool :)
381,"It's really fun but sometimes it's hard, but if you're with your friends then it's all good"
