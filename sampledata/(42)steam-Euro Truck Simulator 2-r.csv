35,Its a very fun game open map i would really recomend buying this product
36,good game
37,"the game is cool to play with a wheel,but with keyboard and mouse...different story, anyway 10/10 game"
38,great gameplay and addictive sim
39,"Throughly addicted.   Not just driving, but a true test of skill threading the needle... where instead of cotton, you're threading a 25 tonne pantechnicon through a set of bollards only a few feet wider than yourself.... At 50mph... on a time limit...   Truly fun.   

When I first started playing this, I was using a keyboard and mouse, and didn't really care about what I was doing.  I was careening into cars, smashing into crash barriers and tipping cargo all over the M1.  Then I started to grok what the game was really about,  being a perfectionist...  

Optimising the money you earn per hour of your time is what this is about.  As the best driver  you can easily earn ten to twenty times the amount of any other driver... But then, what if you hire ten or twenty other drivers?  You can take the time to do more relaxing jobs, buy a nice truck, buy a nice livery and post pictures on Twitter of your sweet ride.   But you can only do that with scads of cash, and you need skills and a workforce to do it.

Once you get eight or more drivers, you start to see the cash build.  They collectively earn about the same as you, and you just have to keep pushing the tin around the map until you get garages all over the continent.

Once that's done, you're free and clear to start enjoying yourself.

"
40,One of the best games i have ever played. Would advice people to install TruckersMP for online fun its great!
41,"Fantastic and immersive if you are into your Simulator games. Kept me busy for hours.
Great game"
42,"The Simulator you expect to never like but somehow fall in love with, Euro Truck Simulator 2 lets you experience the world of cargo haulage right at your PC and it does it very well for the most part. You start with nothing, just taking low paying jobs in the quick job menu but gradually you will expand your company until you have your very own fleet of trucks and truckers all across Europe.

+Great graphics, the trucks and trailers in particular are very high quality
+Large map made even larger by the Going East DLC and the Scandinavia expansion
+The system of building up your company works well and as you improve as a driver it becomes easier to improve your company
+It's a very relaxing game and is a perfect excuse to listen to music, podcasts or the radio
+You can play your music or a radio station through the game's menu
+Trucks have lots of customisation options
+Lots of different skills to improve to make yourself a better driver or to unlock new types of cargo
+The paint job packs are very high quality and in my opinion are worth their price (especially on sale)
+Plenty of great mods and it's very easy to install mods
+Controls are fully customisable
+Plenty of different cargo types, especially with the High Power pack and some of the skills you can unlock
+Several truck manufacturers with several truck designs each
+Seat heights, lights used etc are all customisable
+Has a photo mode with lots of different options allowing you to take plenty of nice shots of your truck
+The devs run events which give you the opportunity to unlock exclusive content through the World of Trucks website
+It's easy to progress through the game without taking loans from the bank which is good for players who want to maximise their rewards in-game

+/-Pretty hard to play with a mouse and keyboard but this is more than made up for with the controller and wheel support, if you don't have a controller or a wheel you might find this significantly more challenging to play

-The AI can be pretty poor sometimes, AI vehicles almost always travel faster than the speed limit, trucks in particular have acceleration faster than makes sense, cars will sometimes accelerate into you while you are turning rather than stop
-Major cities do not resemble cities in anyway, they are very small and all cities have a similar layout (a repair shop, two distributors, somewhere to sleep and a garage)
-Major cities do not have gas/petrol stations so you have to rely on service stations on major highways for fuel
-Doesn't have different seasons which seems odd considering they run seasonal events, such as the Winter Holiday event (seeing as you had to deliver presents it would seem logical to have snow)"
43,real relaxing game tones of fun cant recommend enough
44,yes
45,truck
46,"driving to paris in the darkness hours, speeding down the highway at a gingerly 120/km, blasting cbat in the background i can hardly pay attention to the road infront of me. suddenly i see on my minimap that there is a roundabout up ahead, not realising the mistake i have just made. i prepare myself in this event but mistakingly pressing the right key instead of left. i can see a sedan infront of me with a family of 4, my heart drowns in sorrow as i smash my 4.4 tonne truck into them, instantly killing all of them instantly, without a second word. i gaze into my monitor of what horrors i have committed...
i immediately respawn at the nearest city and continue my journey from there.

thats euro truck for ya"

54,Euro Truck simulator 2 just feels real when you have the streeing wheel breaks gears and the gas i recommend getting this game for people who like to deliver as a delivery truck driver!
55,"besttttttt game
"
56,you can go across the sea and there lots to do.
57,:like:
58,"for those who like to waste time in front of your PC, this game suite for you :D"
59,"Many games attempt this genre and fail.
Euro Truck Simulator 2 succeeds in capturing that one essential thing which makes or breaks a good delivery sim: a living breathing world.

Although technically not fully open world, ETS 2 manages to deliver the best-in-genre type of open world to drive in. Combine that with an enjoyable delivery management system, great driving mechanics and an awesome coop experience. 

It is simply the best and most addicting fun I've had yet for a game of this kind!"

I love and support your work, especially since you announced that West Balkan is coming as DLC pack. I've been waiting for that since I downloaded this game, and it was like 8y ago. Thank you and continue to make such masterpiece, and also end full EU map so we can drive and discover it fully! 

Cheers!"

278,"Did you ever want to drive for hours, keeping to speed limits, not running red lights, getting confused by the GPS and having to drive a two hour detour missing your delivery deadline?  Then this game is made for you!

I make fun of it, but that's actually what you do if you ignore the whole ""run a trucking company"" aspect, but you are fully free to ignore all that and just drive. I like to tune in a local radio, sit in front of the TV like an eight year old playing Mario, and then just do a few deliveries. It's very relaxing..."

Driving a truck for hours might seem boring but Euro truck Simulator 2 just changes that feeling. It's so much fun. It has every part of a real truck that you can control. It even has radio. And not just some random in game radio, it has almost every radio channel that you can listen to in real life. I'm sure you will have fun while playing Euro Truck Simulator 2!"

303,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you

ETS2 is the final version of our childhood (born in 95), smooth as butter, also TMP (Multiplayer platform) helps you play with other people on gigantic servers with 4000 trucks in it. You will see some annoying stuff with funny stuff on the side.
Even still, customising your truck and exploring Europe is always fun.

If you have 2 monitors, crack a tv show on the side, or a podcast, or a movie and hit the road.

430,"Like its American counterpart which I have played more as of the time of writing, the original Euro Truck Simulator 2 also encompasses the feeling of trucking in the dense and interesting roads of both European countries as well as the UK.

I can wholly say that this is a great simulation of the feeling of European Trucking along the differing roads and weather conditions of European countries, whether be it on the left or right side of the road, day or night, rain or shine. There's that sense of serenity that comes with cruising on the highway as well as the annoyance when stuck in traffic, I suppose.

For a game released initially in 2012, I am glad it is still in active development, garnering overwhelmingly positive reviews all throughout. Instead of another game released yearly and under a mandatory paywall for others to enjoy, this one is different. Not to mention, when sales come by, you can pick up the map DLCs for fairly cheap.

Graphics-wise, the game has gotten pretty good as of 1.45, but of course should you not be satisfied nevertheless, there always are mods to counter that issue ‚Äî or any issue you may find with the game, even.

The modding scene with this game is among the largest I've ever come across, spanning different versions of the game as well as changing from the littlest of detail to even improving or adding to the whole map itself.

Definitely a game that I'd recommend you to try, whether you're a casual person who likes freeroam driving games or is a person that is an avid or real life trucker. Frankly quality and solid. 10/10, would completely recommend. If you have a friend who likes driving or peaceful games, then this one I recommend as a gift.


TL;DR: Much like its American counterpart, it's an equally solid game due to great gameplay, good graphics, excellent modding community, and also fits any type of person ‚Äî from casual freeroam driver or real life trucker. Trucking and cruising on the highways and roads have a serene and peaceful experience to it, which makes the general experience 3x better."

441,"game is fun, enjoyable and relaxing, highly recommend getitng tmp when you can"
442,"May be I am a bit spoiled by SnowRunner but I find there is very little point to continue playing this game. May be things are different once you buy some of the newer DLCs, but in the 8 hours I have spent with the ""Essential Bundle"" I have seen:

- very little variety in mission types
- very little variety in the paths used, mostly highway to highway
- very little challenge
- large parts of cities are inaccessible 
- great cities like London and Paris have been very underwhelming in the facilities, activities and experience they provide.
- an UI that is ugly, tedious, and dated (but there is a flat UI mod that makes it a bit prettier).
- most disappointingly of all, the trucks have very little variety. There are only a handful of trucks compared to similar games, and the driving experience is nearly identical from one truck to another. The upgrades I have tried have also made very little difference in the experience. IMHO the various DLC regions should have come with their local Truck manufacturers (or fictional ones inspired by them). And there should be other types of trucks of multiple shapes and sizes.

There are some positives:
+ The management side of things is a bit of standout among similar games. You can buy and upgrade garages. Hire NPC drivers to handle your extra trucks. This side of the game should be further expanded with management of your company and garage staff, 
+ Their DLC model of expanding the map gradually by adding more areas is ideal for a game like this. Other sim devs (:cough: Dovetail Games :cough:) should learn from this. I imagine that with all DLCs this is probably larges open world for on-road travelling, even with the game's scaled down geography, with several real world hours of travelling required to reach one end from another. I imagine those lengthy relaxing virtual drives are why so many love this game. Unfortunately for me the core gameplay is not interesting enough and the DLCs not cheap enough to try it for myself.
+ There is an abundance of mods. 

Some people will likely think 8 hours is not long enough for me to evaluate this game. But the thing is why should I continue to play something I have not enjoyed? If the game takes more than 8 hours to get going, it is a problem with the game's design.

I have read the devs are revisiting old areas to overhaul them. Perhaps that will improve the areas of the map that I have tried so far. I will try it again next year and update this review, and possibly invest more time and money."

478,"Very nice and relaxing game, for people who enjoy trucks. If you expect realistic crashings, or any sort of excitement and thrilling action, stay away from it. Even though various accidents happens, its minimal interactions with those. THe game could really use something like this, random events or jobs, like phone calls with requested deliveries, a little something to spice things up. Also, at least a minimal colision model would be nice ( i guess we wont see trucks desintegrated by trains or anything ) or trucks bursting into flames, but the current model is so 1990. Also what i'd like to see is some official variety ( i know it can be done with various mods but im too lazy ) in vehicles, GTA style, to be able to buy other types of vehicles like smaller trucks, pickups , buses or work for fire dpt. etc."
479,"I started by playing American Truck Simulator, and fell in love. Because of that I came back and purchased Euro Truck Simulator 2, and love it every bit as much. The similarities are enough that it is very easy to jump between both games, yet the countries, roads, businesses, trucks, and other scenery are varied enough to provide a different experience. Lots of fun to play using online profile on www.worldoftrucks.com. I highly recommend this game!"

543,"Euro Truck is game simulator masterpiece. I absolutely love this game. If you ever wanted to be a trucker in life and did not have a chance to do so this game is for you. There are many venicles to choose from, beautiful open world, interesting cargos and much more like you can fully customize your truck .... Cons I would say are separate dlcs. Many people dont want to put more money in this game and so they are losing the full experience. But at all I recommend you to buy this game but dont buy it when it is full price ( 20.00 euros or so). It is better to buy it at 5 when it is on sale. Hope this review helps somebody. :)"

Graphics are awesome, the game concept is really good.

Been playing this game for years. Only downside is sometimes driving on Autobahn(highway) can get a little bit boring. Pay per distance driven is somewhat unrealistic, but for a game concept it is understandable and good. 

8.5/10 would recommend, even if i get bored, a week later im back on the game. LOVE IT! (would love some new 2022. trucks updated :) )"

619,Game is truly well made though I can't play more than 10 minutes before entering in a sleep state. I'm probably chronically sleep deprived and I have trouble falling asleep. But now I can dump the meds and let the chillness of the European roads and the continuous motor humming drive me to Orpheus kingdom.

622,I t is so cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
623,"this game deserves its spot as the pioneer truck game and it delivers an almost proper truck driving experience with many decent aspects it offers. The driving feeling, maneuvers, and loads definitely make you realize how heavy and huge vehicles trucks are. Long routes for shipping goods may seem tedious at the beginning but they are worth it when you deliver them and make money from them. There are diverse roads and sceneries which look fantastic. 

The biggest handicap for some may be the fact that you may get bored after a while if you play with keyboards. Starting your own business is a good way to hold on to the game if you feel bored due to driving. Of course playing with steering wheel is the best way to experience this game. it takes the game into another league by offering super enjoyable and realistic gameplay.

As a result of my evaluation, I can sincerely say that it is an excellent game overall. Anyone who is into cars or just a relaxing game should definitely try it."

638,"AITA for accidentally running over a family of 4

This happened early this morning. I, (68 M) and my wife (18 F) were celebrating our ten year anniversary and we wanted to go to a special fancy restaurant to celebrate. Me and my wife got into my 2004 truck named Bessy and I started up the car to drive up to Wendy's. I was following the Google maps suggestion and was looking at the map, when suddenly i noticed I was approaching a crosswalk. This was no big deal on its own, but suddenly my virgin eyes had been violated by the intense glare of the suns rays bouncing off the heads of four seperate bald people crossing the road. After being flashed violently by these hazardous bald heads I immediately cried out my war cry mating call while my wife was begging me to stop. I let out a stomp to assert my dominance against my wife (Who was going through a puberty mood swing), forgetting that I was the driver. My intense and very powerful stomp had landed on the gas pedal, and my good old truck Bessy had started speeding towards the Bald family like a pissed off bull. Before I could react, we had already rammed into the four baldies at 80 miles per hour. The family of four (Now one because three of them had died from my intense stomp stomp) had taken me to court for quote unquote ""manslaughter"" but I see this as ""innocently trying my best to drive even in the midst of a traffic violation"". I don't think I am the asshole, and my wife agrees with me that it's their fault for being bald in the open like that, and flashing innocent drivers. AITA?"

750,"Enjoyed it at first but it started crashing and traffic was spawning inside of my truck 
"
751,This game is a lot of fun. Nice locations lots of different jobs and you get to run your own trucking business. That being said it would be better if the game had more actual trucks and not just configurations for them. It would also be nice it when you're buying a truck you select the truck and then select the starting config as opposed to having all trucks and configs thrown out in the same menu at each dealer. It's very confusing that way. Same for trailers as well.

775,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

799,"The overall graphics of the game are pretty nice and normal. There is nothing fancy in this game however the sheer simplicity of the game saves it from being a waste of money. However, that being said, I like the concept of driving trucks in different locations and under different types of weathers. I would give this game a solid 7/10."

804,"A very fun game. Relaxing and thorough in giving you a glimpse into the life of an independent startup truck delivery company. It also has the ability to tune into real radio channels. And of course, who wouldn't love a chance to explore the gorgeous countries of Europe? 10/10, would definitely recommend if you're interested! My only warning is that the drives can be very long and perhaps boring or tedious at times. However, that's exactly what this game is all about. The experience that is being a truck *driver* and it pulls that off beautifully."

857,"Euro Truck Simulator 2 is very simple but incredibly addictive. Driving through the European countryside is very soothing and makes the perfect backdrop for listening to music or a podcast. For those of us who need to keep their hands stimulated while they listen to something, this game is absolutely ideal. Your brain can go on autopilot while you go on long drives delivering cargo or simply exploring the map.

The developers continue to update it despite the fact that it's nearly ten years old. There are also regular DLC packs, but prices are fair and the only packs you really need are the ones that add large swaths of driving area to the map. You never feel pressured to buy anything.

The addition if driver/truck/garage management systems was a nice touch that takes it from simply being a driving simulator to something that has an additional axis of progress you can work towards beyond your player's driving skills. It feels good to be able to do my own deliveries and watch my trucking company expand at the same time."

886,"Road trip simulator with unexpected bonusses

I bought this game somewhere in 2020. I was looking for a ideal timesink with high replayability, when this game popped up in my list... As I have no affiliation with trucks whatsoever (besides occassionaly admiring their chonk as they plod along the highways) i was somewhat apprehensive about buying a game about moving trucks from one place to another. But the game was on sale so what could go wrong?.

Two years later i have bought most of the map expansions for the game and logged 250 hours. So far this game has surpassed my initial expectations. The concept is very simple: you have a truck, hook up to a cargo and transport it to any old place in europe.

But the game is more than doing this repetitive action over and over again. What makes this game stand out to me is the way it manages to make you feel as if you  really are moving through different countries. The developers have put a surprising amount of effort into details such as traffic signs, road markings and roundabouts. This is especially true for the more recent map expansions.

Besides this, the game gives you the freedom to customize your experience as you see fit. Play with traffic fines or not, speed limiter on or off. You are als not forced into only transporting cargo. If you want to roam free and discover all  european road systems, you are free to do so.

And as an added bonus it seems to magically improve your trailer parking abilitys. I found myself in charge of a sizeable pickup with a little trailer as part of my work and despite having  no previous real live experience, i had no problem backing it up and parking it. So there  is that!

For me the mayor pros of this game are:
- The detailed road systems (at least in the new locations)

- The freedom and customization abillitys of the game

- The feel of driving is well simulated (especially with wheel and pedals)

- Very few bugs, i have encountered none so far.

- Active dev team. They regularly organise events, which can be completed and reward you with cosmetic items for your truck. They are still (this game was released in 2008!!!) pushing out updates to make the game better, so +1 for that.

The cons:
- The game does show its age in some of the older parts of the map such as england and scandinavia. The environment there isn't as detailed as in the newer parts.

- At some point all of the highway driving got a bit stale for me. There is a big focus on highways in the game, which is only natural of course as it is probably the trucks favoured habitat. But i personally really like discovering the more rural and built up areas and there is proportionally less of that in the game. But recent updates have improved this somewhat.

- Physics. There are no simulations for loss of grip, overheating brakes or jackkniving trailers. Crashing the truck or AI cars can also lead to an awkward dance party. But that is a minor point. 

Final note
I think the game is best played with a controller or wheel and pedals, as using a keyboard means you will be constantly pressing left  - right- left - right in order to go straight.

If you have but a slight interest in roadtrips or travelling through pretty landscapes, this game is a definite recommendation. Even if you have no interest in trucks at all!

Lots of truck brands and I like the levelling system. Worth the 5 euros I spent when it was on sale. Is it worth 20 euros? Depends. Played 19 hours in the past 3-4 days. Good for relaxing and shutting your brain off. Would recommend. 9/10"
902,"You drive around. In big rigs. In Europe. That may not sound like a lot of fun, but trust me, it is. Graphically, the game engine is slightly dated, but the mechanics are spot on, which means you'll be picking up one more mission, long after you were supposed to go to bed, or take out the garbage."

I'm here to enjoy driving , not these crappy bugs !"
1072,fantastic game even beta with MP now
1073,"It's a very fun and relaxing game.  I can't explain how driving a huge truck all over Europe can suck up your time, but here we are!  Recommend a few DLCs of your choice to expand the map at the time of purchase."

Then it's just chaos."

1078,.l.l.l.l.
1079,"Found it in my catalogue of games (one of the many obtained through bundles) and decided to give it a whirl, just to check if, within the sometimes car crash simulation games can be, this was another one.

Two hours later, I found myself in a zen like place, doing quick jobs back and forth with a variety of trucks, enjoying driving back and forth, mindlessly transporting things (don't ask, I certainly didn't) between cities while watching the sights.

Didn't take me long to just go full ham and acquire all map DLCs in the hopes of driving many many hours on them digital roads, again transporting some stuff (still don't plan on asking)."
1080,amazing and fun game. almost as good as ATS.
1081,"The game was done so badly in spots that it would throw your truck in the air and crash your game making you lose all your progress
"

1083,e
1084,"Would reccomend this game 100% great fun, after maybe 50 hours can get quite boring, if you don't want to spend money on the expensive DLC's, and too bad that TruckersMP is corrupt cause for me that's the best part of the game."
1085,Very fun driving game! I like TruckersMP where u play like an Truck driver. Sadly i got banned cause some nerd recorded me accidently bumping into him. Ah! Too bad right? But good game nontheless.

I only do hope that the parking challenges are a little harder, but I am only at level 10 at the moment. I heard harder parking will be available at later levels like 2 trailer reverse parking. I hope to reach those soon."

It is just so casual and on a free day an amazing way to sit back and relax behind my logitech wheel. And with friends it is insanely fun to turn off that speed limiter and go down the highway with 140km/h and then get a traffic jam going by driving 30 and blocking all 3 lanes. Bought it in sale and I would recommend to anyone to try this game, it is so worth it!"

1403,"Been playing this sim a lot. It's relaxing and beautiful especially if you have a sim racing setup with triple screens. The FOV setup is very important if you wish to achieve excellent sim experience and immersion. It is worth spending some time fiddling with different options like FFB, FOV and mapping buttons to suit your play style and visuals. Just like any other sim or game, more time spent gives you better results. As for the performance, even if you own the best GPU, some game locations will have heavy stuttering or low fps."
1404,FUN!
1405,"Many hours and a few DLCs into ETS2, I have no hesitation about recommending this game. Among simulators, this has one of the best base game mechanics‚Äîthe game offers exactly what you'd expect. The locations are interesting, and the DLCs have only gotten better at offering up novel locations to drive through. The developers are communicative and responsive. As a result, this game does not feel dated. I've gotten my money's worth and then some."
1406,buy a steering wheel and you will addict to this
1407,yes
1408,unlimited times I lost my brain cells while honking on npcs is what makes this game playable
1409,I fell asleep while driving but good game
1410,"Still early hours, but after 11 hours of grinding I finally have my own truck and getting some pay days! The start really is a grind for buying your own truck, but the reward for getting that first truck and all the customisations you can play with from the start is a great feeling! It would be nice to start off with a truck, something like Truck Driver on PS4 (my first truck sim game) but the positive in ETS2 is that you get to test drive many of the trucks before purchase, so really you are saving a lot of money making sure your first truck is one you really get on with. So I don't really hold it negatively though the loan options didn't show for me, I could see very high offers for loans but couldn't select them. Its no big thing, I'm here for the trucks and it doesn't disappoint there, but I'm definitely happiest when customising my own wheels!
Its such an eye opener when comparing console gaming to PC! ETS2 is HUGE! The map (even DLC free), trucks on offer, trailers, and the massive customisation options available too. So far its run very smooth for me and I only run a basic 4+ year old ¬£500 prebuild PC. an AMD FX-8300 Eight-Core Processor 3.30 GHz. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti. 8GB RAM. And I can play on High and Ultra settings smoothly. I play my own music too, simply add MP3 music files to your documents/ETS2/Music folder. Loads of options for graphics, sound, GPS, map, layouts and truck controls, you can have a very simple auto setup for new players or go full on sim mode.
I've yet to try out the convoys! Something I am very interested in doing! So far this game has ticked all the boxes I was hoping from it. And I got it in the sales for something like ¬£6!!! This was like receiving a gift.. from myself! Loving the feel of the trucks and the scenery.

Just 3 minor things at the moment are negative,
1. I can't get the cruise control to work which is a pain as I play with controller so trigger throttle isn't easy to maintain a reliable speed. I've had so many tickets by going 1 or 2 mph over the limit.
2. There is an area in England (SE), sadly can't remember where precisely but its off a motorway onto a carriageway with a fuel and rest stop where being on the left lane penalises you for driving on the wrong side of the road.
3. The road coming out of Calais into England (on England's side) goes up a steep ramp to a fast motorway with a blind corner and no lights, so you literally have to guess if you can go or not. And with the uphill struggle you end up stuck in the path of traffic flying at you! Had loads of Channel Tunnel short runs and every time I would look for any sign of lights and either I need an eye check up or there just isn't anything there,
None are game breaking but would love to see those looked into, if I find the road with the penalty I'll try to come back to edit it here. But even with those 3 things I'm still giving this a solid 10/10. And that's before even experiencing the convoys..
Definitely a must for truck and sim lovers."

1417,"Where do I begin! What a great time to be had playing this game... got plenty of spare time? play this game! Just won the lottery? play this game! About to quit your job?  ...probably look for a new job... yeah, don't play this game too much if you need a new source of income. Try applying for a job. Maybe try something you never thought of before... maybe join the Army. If you do there IS a game you should play a lot to get ready for the constant combat you will be exposed to in the Army; it's called Call of duty.. any version will do.

So yeah, that's my review."

1468,"I got this game very recently and was really enjoying it, looking through the DLC I saw that Russia was planned. Sadly the developers have taken the decision to make a political statement by announcing it will not be released for now due to current geopolitics. I play games to escape the BS, not to hear somebody else's opinion on it. I would take no issues if some players decided not to buy it but for the developer to take that decision out of the player's hands and thereby insert their own particular views into my experience was just wrong in my opinion and I will no longer be playing or adding DLC as previously planned."

1674,The trucks
1675,"it is exactly what it says it is, a truck sim. does its job flawlessly."
1676,"ENG:

If you dream of taking a break from nerdy dumps like Dota 2, CS and GTA 5, I recommend ETS2.
You  stretch your left toes while a 10-ton truck race on a cruise with Country-Radio.

The most interesting thing is that you are really drawn into this game. You want to earn as much as possible, you start swearing at every –∞ssh–æl–µ-NPC, you want to keep your babe-truck virgin, drive as many beautiful places as possible.

In short, category C you want to get more and more with each session of the game - the profit that your lazy –∞ss wants to find a job. You do not get tired mentally, only physically, your sweaty –∞ss starts to hurt from the chair.
 
10/10 - I recommend it to every pudge degenerate, idiot who takes AWP in every eco-round, dumb who downloaded cheats for the game and breaks the whole session for every player.

1702,I love the game. I can play it for several hours straight!
1703,toti soferii-s niste hoti ailailailailaa
1704,great game
1705,"Been playing it for a while. If you play it without mods it can get boring soon but with multiplayer third-party software and some fun mod the experience becomes much more realistic and enjoyable. worth buying,"
1706," Is a very good game if you like trucks. The game needs some updates for the sounds, simulation, phisics. But is a very nice game. If you don t have a wheel is not so fun. I have a logitech g29 and it works very good if you set it corect. 
  I recommand this game for all the car and trucks lovers!"
1707,"it's a hard job. change gear, change gear, change gear, check your mirrors, murder a prostitute, change gear, change gear, murder, check your mirrors. it's a lot effort in a day"
1708,nice game
1709,Awesome game to learn something about the logistics industry.
1710,It's alright for a few hours.
1711,Great game worth the buy.
1712,"Good game but I would like rigged chassis as a option (and some 
compatible trailers), full rear light customisation (you can choose from different lights (square or circular) and the position and colour. Some classic trucks would also be nice, apart from that, I'd recommend this game"
1713,"i crashed into my friend and made him lose 14k :)
update - he made my game crash making me lose 24k :("

1723,"You think its going to be boring right? Because driving around at 56mph down motorways isnt very exciting but its very fun. Its challenging, you learn new things and its actually really engaging and relaxing. Personally i would recommend buying the DLC too because it adds more locations and really enhances the game. Also would recommend downloading ProMods which transforms the game (google it). Only bad points for me are that the trucks in game are not the latest versions anymore (apart from the DAF) and the money that you earn for jobs seems to be very high (not realistic). On top of this once youve got a truck and built your business then some of the fun leaves the game because youve done everything. The only thing left to do at that point is drive around making more and more money that you dont really have anything to spend on because youve already got a business, trailers, trucks etc."

1757,"Best game ever made, too bad i can‚Äôt get the actual wheel, stick shift and pedals to really experience the game how it is supposed to, but it is a super fun game!!!!"
1758,"So as far as a review goes this game is top shelf, if you enjoy driving games of any kind you will like this game, for the most part bug free, most negative reviews are from folks that pile on mods that cause their troubles, SCS does excellent work and while the games graphics do show their age in places SCS are always upgrading both ETS2 and ATS so it's always getting even better.
Another great aspect are simply the game play options, there are a ton of them, SCS understands that not all players want the same experience and they give you the options to play the game your way.
As far as content the base game has enough to keep a casual player busy for hundreds of hours then add in the very reasonably priced DLC's and you can spend hundreds more.
If you are North American and play ATS and need some more tucking in your life don't be afraid to dive into ETS2 it's a real pleasure to jump between the two games and enjoy all that both have to offer.
As with any comments here on Steam this is only my humble opinion but ETS2 is a really great game made by a great developer, read some of the reviews and for sure check out some vids, I think you will buy it."

1789,"Such a great game just for chilling, hitting a road and spending time in your thoughts. You don't see how time flaws and spend in a game many hours. I love DLC's and little details that they added: like, cities, trains, boarders, and outskirts, etc. Want more of them, like, more complicated roads and more detailed life that you kinda interact with. Definitively recommend for a person who like relaxing driving, long roads and listening radio. Very cool game! :)"
1790,thanks  for development for this game! but optimized is want to this game
1791,"just buy, you'll see"
1792,Veeery good game üööüöõ
1793,e bun ma in pula mea
1794,Truck go boom
1795,Kinda nice with the steering wheel
1796,simulates actual scenarios of driving. would recommend if you just wanna relax and have a nice drive around the beautiful Europe world Euro Truck simulator has to offer. Buy this game its definitely a keeper!
1797,Very nice game played along with friends or alone. Can give you a good amount of good experience within the game.
1798,Stress relief
1799,The most fun I've ever had in my life
1800,its ok
1801,"The truck simulation is excellent and the basic mechanics of driving across a beautifully simulated version of Europe are fun, but other parts of the simulation feel shockingly unpolished. Other vehicles' AI is buggy, the application of traffic fines sometimes makes no sense (e.g headlight violations in broad daylight), and random detours can add hundreds of km to your route without your GPS warning you or suggesting alternatives. Collision damage, fines, and detours can all be turned off in the extensive settings, but this undermines the realism that is the game's bread and butter. I'm amazed the non-truck parts of the game still feel so rough when it's been out for nearly 10 years."
1802,"Personally, I like to put on some music I haven't heard for a while, and go for a drive.  
That's all I want from this game :)"
1803,GOOD GAME!! :D

Does it lack in some aspects? Yes it very much does.
Will ETS2 ever get better? Whenever they decide to move on and release ETS3.
Do i recommend this time consuming and effortless game? Fuck Yeaah!
Drive around in Europe, Scandinavia even if its just a few cities in some countries but it is worth it!
Get truck, map or trailer addons and you can do a lot of stuff!

1890,"Euro Truck Simulator 2.
A game being in development since a decade. The main core of the game stays the same as it was back days, except developers still provides new content. Either by refreshing existing cities or developing new regions dlc's with reasonable price tags.
SCS Software are legit one of best developers nowadays.  They're Constant support to their hidden gem of sim games, as well as listening to fans feedbacks.

Graphically it did get old but still is pleasing to eyes. 
Gameplay wise. Its simply brilliant, so relaxing game, to do something meanwhile listening to music. 

If you're a sim fan, this is definitely a game for you. Always something to do, tons of achievements to get, and i dont mean here steam achievements (tho these exists too).
Being able to buy your first truck without taking a loan is an achievement on its own, and gives a nice feeling of accomplishing something. 

If you ever wanted to make your own company this is game for you. Simply AMAZING career mode.

Just try it, there was (or still is) an ETS2 demo to try. Do it. Game is relatively cheap, and on discounts u can get it for funny moneys like 5‚Ç¨, and it will pay off double. It's really worthed."

1909,"you're probably thinking this game is boring. Why would anyone just want to drive a big truck around? Thats what I thought, but when my friends told me to get this game, and I did, everything changed. (No, the fire nation didn't attack.) I got obsessed. I would put a podcast on, do a drive or two. Then it took over my life. Everything is truckies now. You will get obsessed, but is that a bad thing? If you're not sure, play the demo for a little bit! You'll see what i'm talking about!"

I own nearly everything ETS2 and American Truck Simulator related as well.  Boring it is not. The difficulty scales well. Controller and wheel-pedal support are fine.  You can prefer short or long hauls.  It gets updates often.  The community is solid.  It is IMO a lot of fun."

1921,"I'm 16 yo boomer, who likes sitting in front of my pc. Normally I have nothing to do, so I turn on steam and the first game I see is Euro Truck Simulator 2. I just run it and the time just  go by very quckly. 
You just go through many  missions and jobs, earn money, then you can buy your own truck. I recommend playing it on steering wheel with pedals, but you can also play on keyboard. It's really relaxing just sitting and driving some trucks. It gets better when you get more and more dlc like going east, italy, vive la france, scandinavia or even heavy cargo pack. You also gain steam cards which you can use to craft a badge that gives you xp. 
Overall, after 25 hours in the game, I didn't get tired of it even once. And the most important thing is that this game is not really expensive. I bought it on a -75% sale with some dlc. Hope you enjoyed the review, and have fun with ypur trucks!"

1923,Amazing game to pass the time and listen to music or podcasts
1924,"I love BALLZ there are monkeys crawling in my wallz
Straight sigma male grindset average gunky game.
here is a cheesecake recipe 
STEP 1
To make the base, butter and line a 23cm loose-bottomed tin with baking parchment. Put the digestive biscuits in a plastic food bag and crush to crumbs using a rolling pin. Transfer the crumbs to a bowl, then pour over the melted butter. Mix thoroughly until the crumbs are completely coated. Tip them into the prepared tin and press firmly down into the base to create an even layer. Chill in the fridge for 1 hr to set firmly.

For more detail on how to make a biscuit base, take a look at our how to make a biscuit base video.

STEP 2
Slice the vanilla pod in half lengthways, leaving the tip intact, so that the two halves are still joined. Holding onto the tip of the pod, scrape out the seeds using the back of a kitchen knife.

STEP 3
Pour the double cream into a bowl and whisk with an electric mixer until it‚Äôs just starting to thicken to soft peaks. Place the soft cheese, icing sugar and the vanilla seeds in a separate bowl, then beat for 2 mins with an electric mixer until smooth and starting to thicken, it will get thin and then start to thicken again. Tip in the double cream and fold it into the soft cheese mix. You‚Äôre looking for it to be thickened enough to hold its shape when you tip a spoon of it upside down. If it‚Äôs not thick enough, continue to whisk. Spoon onto the biscuit base, starting from the edges and working inwards, making sure that there are no air bubbles. Smooth the top of the cheesecake down with the back of a dessert spoon or spatula. Leave to set in the fridge overnight.

STEP 4
Bring the cheesecake to room temperature about 30 mins before serving. To remove it from the tin, place the base on top of a can, then gradually pull the sides of the tin down. Slip the cake onto a serving plate, removing the lining paper and base. Pur√©e half the strawberries in a blender or food processor with the icing sugar and 1 tsp water, then sieve. Pile the remaining strawberries onto the cake, and pour the pur√©e over the top."

1986,"This gamewould be much better if it had actual roads or even narrow/challenging roads/stuff to do, as of now it's good only w/ mods or playing Multiplayer, otherwise it's just highway & highway + the sound is very bad for a company that used the best equipment to capture real world truck sounds, modders are doing way better.

2009,"Great game, very relaxing"
2010,"This is a very beautiful game, from the scenery to the small details that you probably wouldn't even notice. The physics of the trucks in this game is extremely similar to that of real life, and the driving is also very fun."
2011,wow
2012,Great game to relax and listen to podcasts too.
2013,I've been playing this non stop. It's so fun and relaxing. It's not required but a must playing on a wheel. It's so immersive. 10/10 for me
2014,Trucks go brrr
2015,A great game!
2016,cool
2017,The best simulation game
2018,"AI is pretty awful, I've been chillin' with cruise control on and perfectly in lane and quite often really I'm side swiped by some car thinking he's the boss.

Also it seems rear ""load in"" is very low and stuff seems to just appear randomly (even on the highest quality setting)... I would like stuff to load in much further away from the sides and rear.

Otherwise it's not bad, the game however can become very expensive when you start buying all of the map addons and some of the DLC packs for tartin' your Rig up are 1 vehicle specific, ie the Renault one is for 1 single reno truck, the truck you wouldn't even buy as the starter truck because there's a more powerful one for nearly nothing more.

Convoy mode is pretty cool, you can all do the same delivery with family and friends (although giga repair bills entail when people start trying to race lol)."
2019,Yeah its good if you like simulation and driving
2020,Mega W
2021,"I really love this game, even if I'm playing it with XBOX 360 controller. :)"
2022,"I played this game for a few hours now and its cool and all, if it wasnt so bugged. Multiple times when i turned the game off and went to bed, the next day the game said ""the save file couldnt be load because your game crashed"" or something like that even tho I closed the game normal. another one I had was when I went to the bottom left of the map (DLC Countries included) and when i tried to save it deleted my save states(most of the time it happend there but since then everywhere else it happend sometimes). and after sometime that happened (about 2-4 hours) I restarted the game because the bug was still present and when tried to load one of the latest save states it said the same thing i discribed above and the last quicksave i could loade was a ingame week back and between there and the latest broken save were atleast 6 REAL HOURS! so because of this bug if lost 6 hours of progress. 

If theres a mod which Fixes those bugs (This game allows mods) PLEASE tell me because i like the game but these bugs destroy it entirely

I still recommend this game because its good. its only those bugs which mostly kills the fun playing it.

2113,"I can embrace my inner trucker in me, finally... broom broom"
2114,"Very Entertaining, would recommend to any future young truck drivers!"
2115,"This is probably one of the best simulators I have ever played. Its realistic art style, feel of weight and interactive controls for your trucks (such as a Light Horns, Indicators and much more...) create extraordinary and addicting gameplay, minus the patience you have to have for traffic and long road trips of course.

Speaking of, I've decided to accumulate a list of pros and cons during my time.
Pros:
- Smart AI drivers outweigh the Dumb AI drivers
- AI response to player actions (Waiting for player to make turn or let them turn etc)
- Developer response to road designs (Example: The first road to enter the highway near Calais after exiting the Channel Tunnel)
- Details (Braking while its raining has a chance to make the player hydroplane, braking too hard stalls the engine, AI turns engine off when waiting to use fuel pump during long queues)

Cons:
- Most roads need immediate redesign as it is almost impossible to enter a motorway/highway on a junction
- Some roads and terrain show the ""underworld""
- UK noticeably needs a rework as the motorways are way too ""twisty"" as opposed to the actual UK
- AI brake checks player randomly, especially when there is nothing wrong nor on a hard corner (a car passed just to get in-front of me in the UK and brake checked just to enter a petrol station)
- SATNAV rarely attempts to make player go through blocked areas
- Some areas with invisible walls have no blockers

Overall, as long as these small little cons don't get on your nerves, I believe this is one of the best simulators out there. 

Important Note: If you wanna expand and buy the DLC(s) sometime...I recommend waiting until they go on sale for 50% or 75%. ¬£3.99 for 6,000km+ of map expansion is an absolute steal.

2151,"For some reason I have this bug that prevents me from seeing anything when I start the game up. I hear the sound effects, and the game responds to button presses, but I just can't see anything. First it depended which version I launched the game on, Like I had to launch it from the Steam page instead of the desktop, but now I can't see anything no matter what version of the game I boot up. Even safe mode doesn't work. It could be because i have a low end computer, but then why was I able to run the game properly before? Anyway, the following review is based off the times that it properly booted up and could actually SEE SHIT ON MY SCREEN.

2153,Basically its the best truck simulating game
2154,"This isn't a game for me. When I set up to play this, I use a force-feedback Wheel and pedal system, and I connect to my 55"" 4K screen. I LIVE this. I EXPERIENCE this. I'm sick of always getting tickets for doing hardly anything, but regardless, this is very realistic, and I do like it a lot.
I hope one day there's a ""Real as can be"" WORLD Truck Simulator. With the option for real time ferries and what not. Okay, maybe not RT Ferries, but the quality here does make you wish for such things."

We spend the evening chatting about things, whilst driving around Europe. Sometimes we play serious, other-times we let loose and race each other down the motorway at 80mph. 149hrs in and I still enjoy driving around, discovering new places.
Give it a go, you might be pleasantly surprised at how relaxing it is."

ETS2 is one of those games that seem to be nothing special from outside, but inside its a masterpiece, this was the first game I ever grinded, back when I was little I used to play it all day on my brothers computer, but then it just kinda disappeared, but now recently I found this game and oh my, the nostalgia the everything, a true masterpiece."

2174,"Fuck this piece of shit software and fuck SCS Games.
I was on a 80km/h road, went straight ahead and another Trucker wanted to turn left, even it's my priority in traffic, he turned anyway and we crashed.
I got fined with 240‚Ç¨ and the fucking game told me it was my fault.

Where is that a realistic simulation?
I would return this fucking shit if I could, even for free I would not take it.

Seriously, I loved this game but this just shows how bad the developers are.

2184,"tl;dr just buy it on sale when it's absurdly cheap and see it for yourself.

Despite the name this isn't a simulator. Not in the full sense of the word. Your definition may vary but for me the goal of a simulation is to try to depict the reality as much as possible. I know that full simulation is not always desired as there still needs to be some gameplay value which may require certain shortcuts and simplifications. Still, this game doesn't even seem to strive to be an actual simulator. It clearly tries to attract a bigger community by following a more simcade-y path.

In a similar way as we talk about ""walking simulators"", we could also derive a term ""driving simulator"". And I believe this is what suits this game the most. It's impossible to fail, there's no place where your truck can't fit and you need to avoid, roads seems wider than in reality and every mistake can be easily forgiven due to simplified economy. The process of loading and unloading the truck requires you to hit just one button. Ultimately, what's left in the process is pure driving experience which is simply take it or leave it.

And I take it. It's simply relaxing - take a trailer, turn on the radio and drive. Sometimes that's all what you want to do. There are people around here who prefer to cruise around the map in GTA V rather than enganging in any action-packed activities. This game is exactly this but uses trucks as a main theme.

Anyway... don't expect miracles. This game has gone a long way during 10 years of its development but there are still some issues with core elements and unpolished gameplay aspects. Proper antialiasing is lacking and that's important in a game where you mostly stare at the road somewhere in the distance. Seeing all those jagged lines might get tiresome. AI is fine at best, it might behave weird on highways which is most roads (it's a trucking simulator, isn't it?). Multiplayer doesn't always work as it should, I sometimes expect desyncs especially with weather. Lighting is nice unless you enter the tunnel where it's just not right at daytime. Certain areas of the map hasn't been reworked yet and look straight bad as if taken from 2000s. Some of those issues might be minor but trust me, as you spend more and more time driving, you keep noticing these things as there is nothing else to focus at.

There are getting there. They reworked lighting, added multiplayer, they've been revamping old areas in the map. There's certainly some labor put in the game to keep it fresh. However, it takes time. A huge amount of time. For this reason I simply recommend buying this game as it is and don't expect things to be fixed. If they actually fix them, that'll be nice. But nothing's granted."
2185,nice game

2191,"Great game to pass the time. You don't have to have the best computer to run it, you can alter the driving mechanics to your familiarity with driving trucks in real life, and the gameplay has the perfect balance of keeping your attention without getting too confusing or technical. I would 100% recommend this game."

2246,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

2258,"Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) is a great game that's been consistently updated for a decade over which SCS greatly improved the quality of their works... in fact so much so that the map has unfortunately become inconsistent with some countries looking really immersive and some looking like a port from an early 2000's game. With regards to the latter, it's primarily Poland and the United Kingdom; those two are in the base game and haven't been touched since release in 2012 and are in need of a major overhaul while Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, which were added in the first map expansion, need a solid update.

With this in mind, I would recommend folks try out American Truck Simulator (ATS) that was released in 2016 and already has had its base map overhauled to match the quality of ATS's DLC's - this way, you'll have a much more enjoyable and consistent experience compared to ETS2 quality roller-coaster."

2284,"It's good. The quality of DLCs can vary between each other, but they are at least worth exploring. Community map mods should improve it greatly, although some popular options will require some or all map DLCs."
2285,trucks and trucks
2286,"it's a good game but not one that I'd actually recommend you buy unless you're really into trucks. the main gameplay loop consists of 
1:find a job
2:spawn at/go to location (depending on if the truck is your's or a company's)
3:drive past the 3 buildings in the capital ""city"" (of which 1 is a dealership and 1 is a repair shop, and the last is the one you left)
4:merge on to motorway
4.5: drive past the endless service stations and absolute barren wasteland most places seem to be
5: drive until you reach the 3 buildings in your destination
6: park, and deliver trailer (but you don't have to)
7: get paid
8:repeat process until you can afford the thing you wanted
again, interesting concept, but don't buy unless your love for trucks outweighs the boredom of driving for hours just to repay that bank loan you took out to buy a basic truck"

2334,"Be a truck driver without the long hours. Starting out, you drive for someone else. Eventually you get enough money to buy your own truck so you can start your own trucking business. With only two hours in, I have not earned my own truck. I just finished my first delivery. 

Games such as these live and die on the driving mechanics. If you have played any GTA you won't have any trouble with the mechanics. Handling a big rig is another matter. I spent my first hour trying to back and turn the truck without ramming into buildings or parked cars. Once I got onto the freeway it felt like I was really driving on a freeway, something I haven't done for years (in real life I only drive in town). The game environment has a real-world look, almost photo-realistic. The mirrors actually work. The GPS works. The radio works. 

One thing I didn't like: there is no driving avatar. It looks like Caspar is driving the truck. Or maybe one of the Mythbusters are driving it with their remote. Not a big deal. It does break immersion a bit."

It's a beacon of simplicity, caked in a layer of gameplay not often seen in gaming.

A simulator that allow you to run your own company. Starting from nothing and in to a europe wide enterprise. Building garages and hiring drivers to the point you can just drive around and do whatever you want since money won't be an issue.

The game features realistic driving, puts your parking skills to the test, and requires you pay attention to local speed limits and trafic laws to turn a good profit. It's by far one of the most relaxing and low energy experiences I could ever reccomend on this platform.

Get it! Even if it's just to mindlessly drive around while listening to podcasts in the background."

2364,"I heard this game was supposed to be realistic, but I disagree. I was able to move freight between the EU and Britain easily. 

Jokes aside, it's a detailed sim with a lot of polish (and Polish). Driving is super relaxing, and construction work, accidents, and road closures make the world dynamic. I do wish the management side of the game had a little more to it; logistics and supply chain management are enormously complex and there's untapped potential there."
2365,gud.
2366,"nice game
"
2367,My Grandson bought me this game and I have played it for hundreds of hours! Buy this for your grandparents kids!
2368,"This game is really fun and relaxing but can also make me rage more then any other game.

I was fined for being rear ended (again), then hit a plastic road cone and my truck was hypersonic lanched from Denmark to outer space.

The physics are rather poor and the AI is down right terrible, but I still love to play this game.
"

2409,"I live in Britain, there is a shortage of lorry drivers here!"
2410,Best game
2411,"The game is very cool, clearly worth the money. You can kill time by transporting goods, it's cool. But, like all games, it has its drawbacks: 1. It's not the best graphics, but it's not bad for a 2012 game. 2. there are broken textures on fences, it is very easy to get stuck in them. There is also a good number of add-ons that you can buy if you get bored. And so, in principle, the game is cool, you will definitely like it. Worth the money."
2412,Just yes
2413,Most Realistic Game that provides Calmness and Soothing for a stressed mind!

other than that it's pretty good
"
2431,"well well well, euro truck sim. if you have a good mate that likes to drive lorry's through calais this is the game for you however i don't have that, i have to play this game with a stupid old mong of a grandma who leaves you stranded on a discord call for 3 hours 30 mins while he drinks vodka for the first time of his life. sooooo i had to play fs with someone who i didn't want to play with classyjaden22 knows this person. {ring ring}<<<hint"
2432,its fun good keeps me from being bored i recommend
2433,Amazing game!
2434,drive truck and make moneyüëç
2435,"One of those games on sale, why not?  Then you spend way too much time.  I used to drive a 32' RV all over and that truly helped me on this.  Italy, France, East, all worth picking up.  Addictive."
2436,This game is very fun and this game can be multiplayer
2437,Cool entertainment...
2438,ok
2439,fun but could get boring. if u got a wheel then why not get this
2440,"Basically the game is as following:

Pick up your cargo,
Drive to your destination
Deliver cargo
Repeat.

To be honest this works better then a psychologist to get relaxed.

PS: this may change when playing multiplayer because driving might be hard for some people, but overall this game is a 10/10"

A unique game that keeps you coming back for more over and over, dominate the european continent with your trucking empire and fleet and earn some serious cash. Bravo to the devs for continuously bringing out new content, dlc, maps and events.
gameplay is great and you can do as little or as much as you desire. 
Enjoy convoys driving with friends with set jobs for all or just play on your own building that empire. btw a steering wheel and pedals is an absolute must."

You should try it 999/10"
2522,If you like Trucks this is the game for you
2523,"I've been on American Truck Simulator ever since it released, so I had to add this one to the collection. Same gameplay, just different roads and a whole different environment to refresh and enjoy. The support of this game between updates, DLCs, and the third party mods are the same as ATS, which makes this an outstanding game with potential hours of relaxing and enjoying your drive. If you have the money, after purchasing this game, go out and buy some DLCs and some third party mods (Zeemods, Jon Ruda, B4RT, etc.) to really make this game come alive"
2524,BIG MAN TING
2525,If your bored and have nothing do to. I guess you can play this.

2590,IT VERY REALISTIC
2591,Best game!
2592,Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a very interesting game but enjoyable one. I am from the United States of America and even though I have both American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 I mainly play on Euro Truck Simulator 2 over American Truck Simulator. The reason is of many. First the graphics on this game are way more crisp and clean and clear rather then American Truck Simulator ( bloom way too high ). Secondly the amount of trucks we are given to use or choose from is a wide range of trucks and the options that come with each one varies. The large map scale of this game is very well done and even if you purchase the game without the ability to purchases map DLC's right away the large default map is quite impressive. Euro Truck Simulator 2 has that country background style rythum that does not come with American Truck Simulator.

2637,"drive truck, yes."
2638,good!
2639,"literally amazing game, i don't need to say anything else at all"
2640,"IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE, PLS READ, TLDR BOTTOM.

1. Slow progress. Updates are plenty, but content, nah. It's small things here and there. It took them 10 years to add air suspension.. And still, tons missing!

Updates are more to screw with the mods, than add things. It's like they try to quickfix their sorry ass of an game, even tho it has been 10 years. They should by now have been down to fewer updates, but more consistent and meaningfull ones.

And if something of use is coming, you can bet it'll have a prize tag, or it's just ""too little, too late"". 

2. The community. Their own moderators derails threads, and permbans you when talking back - SCS don't reply nor even care about their steam community ( they left it, and left an idiot to moderate that can't even shut it or keep it to topic ). The average age is 14 - 16, so maturity, is around there.

Even tho you're around trucks, it's very rare to meet an actual truckdriver.

Many of these kids, even if they aren't serverowner - they'll for sure use their time to destroy yours. Some use their time to play police, especially TMP. Keep in mind, we're talking kids who still lives at home, now supervising you and will report you to retarded staff who will ban you, for weeks.

Some kids even doctoring with evidence, and when TMP is presented with the full story, they ignore for weeks, then play it on something else, and close report. Lying, ramming and blockin guy, who sat and used his freetime to nail others to the cross? Kept driving, even tho the situation itself should have been enough for the dude to sit out for a couple of years.

Not even a ""sorry"" for 3 weeks ban. My feedback, ignored and trashed weeks later. 
I do opposite myself, maybe that's why my community smiles at me, without I force my community to pay, fill out shit or spam #BestCommunityEver. Not even an EULA.

DONT. USE. TMP, if you have >2 braincells and despise dramaqueens & bootlickers. Most sit and polish their trucks in their fake VTCs, playing with their shiny titles, trying to be on the next ""Idiots on the road"", driving same road, back and forth. 

Some sit, on their FREETIME, watching you, to rep you, for that shiny star on their ""Special Deputy""-role.

If you do TMP, ALWAYS(!) record EVERY second on there. Saved me so much time and trouble.

I was a member for over 6 years, before I ever had with staff to do, and it was because some dude blocked the way on kirkenes road. For minutes, he refused to move, even staff admitted it - but still rep me after I overtook him ( I did exactly like you should IRL, I know, I'm getting paid for it ), in this case a week ban. First time in 6 years, for a fucking 10 - 20 km/h overtake with no meeting traffic, where the dude clearly didn't take his chance to drive..

I've seen people smash others, like a tornado, get banned 3 days. But what is actual harm to others, to a legal and justified overtake..

Above is TMP in a nutshell, thankfully most trash wanna be around trash, but still, you should'nt wanna be trash.

3. SCS is shit. People don't know, because SCS transparency is shitty or they're bootlickers ( too many of them! ), but SCS literally just with 1.45 (came out the other day) targeted custom servers who provide larger servers than 8, but still not as big nor cancerous as TMP, with a clientlock on everyones game, so we can't join nor see 8+ servers without modified exe-files.

It's not even in their changelog. You'd think for transparency, it should be mentioned they choose your options.. 

And they have targeted us/these servers from day 1.

So in short, they literally hardcoded into the game, what you can(t) see and play. But TMP, who has created this game horrible reputation, has made millions in the process and has the worst management I've ever meet in a game, is still here.. People literally came from that place to my server, crying, hating, screaming over how horrible TMP is on the CB. Like for hours, random people during all day, once mentioned TMP, shit just poured out. 

But then, they lost 3/4 of their community over a night. Rest of us know why, but not SCS. They pull 4k people, when ETS has over 35.000 people playing...

TMP is so bad, new people regurlarly comes in, judging my server since it's one of the bigger, as I'm one of TMP. I have worked since day one on Convoy, to be as opposite to them as human possible. Luckely, I just get shit until I tell them I'm not TMP, far from, like opposite, and they realise they can actually breathe here. People enjoyed it, till SCS shut it down - without warning. 

SCS didn't even come by and say hi before.. 

We were thousands, combined into dramafree communities ( that's amazing, in this game - like making fire outta thin air amazing ) with a strong backbone of regular people who do meetups, everyday. Standards and maturity, no BS or drama - 100% free. And we filled out, every day, 12 AM/PM, didn't matter.

If you were new and you wanted a perfect starting zone, You should've come, as so many did, to us. We'd set you up good with free cam, how to solve problems, installs, mods, be a part of convoys, races, meetups, you could advance - you had questions, we had answers.

Big problem for SCS, since they look more for paying sheep who'll happily devour their prizetag with no second thought ( forced to pay, to play full exp ), while spamming #BestCommunityEver ( observe the singular, not pluralis - they will ensure, there will only be ONE community ). 

We did, what SCS should've and what they said they would do.

4. The content SCS puts out. It's a joke in my opinion, kids in their mums basements deliver better stuff, like fenders, bullbars, lights, lightboxes, new trucks/trailers/maps etc, FOR FREE in many cases.

With way more diversity, detail and options to specific thing.

SCS were so satisfied with Iberia map and its details, but come on, Promods made even better maps 2013 than you made 2020. And promods is 100% free, 1 euro if you wanna download quick, but you could download slower for free.

Their survival is based on their monopoly on truckgames. It's gonna change one day. 
------------

I've done nearly everything in this game - freecam, savediting, mods, tweaks, bigger servers than game gives, i've gotten bugs you most never will know - but i've also been on TMP for years, as SP, as I've now played SCSMP for over a year. I've been a player, I've been staff, I now own my own community. 

I've played for over 10 year, and was reading about TMP back when it was on Moddb and only speculation was a thing. Ontop of that, I've driven trucks for soon 8 years IRL.

If it's in this game, I've most likely tried it to the extent I understand it and use it, or know enough to be able to help myself or others further. 3000 hours, i've explored this game as widely possible ( and further than SCS even ) and SCS could have been decent, but their recent changes and their shitty practices with content, restrictions and their aim - it's disgraceful and I feel ashamed I've paid their salaries.

I've spent around 2k hours into my community the last 12 months. Nearly 24/7 work, ontop of 40h+ job. Lost over a night, by the very creator of the game I paid for.

How they still allow TMP to exist, for all shit they STILL spread (while making millions!), but kill communities built on passion and love, who sits and help people globally for 100% free. Unbelievable.

10 years, I could make whole magazines of SCS/TMPs stupidity.

Don't make the same mistake, and if you must, buy only the standard game on sale and start researching how to obtain the DLC's another way. ( *cough* Youtube *cough* ).

Over 12 months, thousands of hours invested and thousands on thousands of players - and not a single negative reaction to my server. Not even the other similar servers. But we had to go. TMP tho, leaves scar on your community and bad taste in mouth, still here.. 

I do not support a game developer, who works against its own players and community.

nothing and i repeat nothing comes close to how amazing this game really is, with over 500+ hours i can assure you that this game will give you hundreds of hours of fun and with the addition of a highly skilled modding community the fun just keeps on going.

One last thing, if you plan on modding this game I recommend using only realism mods as it turns this game into a true work of art."
2793,"this game is soooo immersive. i would massively recommend downloading truckersMPtoo in order to go online with other truckers, makes the game abit laggy but i guess that depends on your specs.

(English evaluation, 90% by Google Translate) I've played this game for 200+ hours and I think:
1. Although the picture quality is good, it lacks in many details (such as road reflections in rainy days, road bumps, physics, weather details, etc.)
2. The shifting logic of the automatic transmission is rubbish, I had to set a key to switch between manual and automatic transmission mode
3. The cursor cannot be moved out of the game when it is paused, or there is no way to put ETS2 in the background, which has always been a problem.
4. After the multimedia key (previous, play/pause, next) is pressed, neither the music software in the background nor the radio function in the game can switch songs. Do I need to set shortcut keys?
5. In many cases, the mechanics or principles of the game have not changed, and the update is only the map or vehicle update. Even if the mod author does not need to change anything, it is judged to be incompatible. As a result, some mods need to be constantly updated. Both the author and the player are tortured. Wouldn't 
 SCS Software also improve the game's own truck?
Summary: It's fun, but there are many small details that really affect the game experience"

2865,"I really recommend playing this game if you like driving games, or maybe even if you don't like driving games. It's really fun and REALLY beautiful game. If you have a high end device i really recommend to go to settings and change the graphics to high or even ultra. By far one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen. It also has a lot to do. To be honest, it needs a lot of time- fx. I've played for almost 15 hours (a lot for me) and I've only gotten the cheapest truck there is and nothing else pretty much. But it is worth it to buy your own truck because you can get a lot more money for jobs, you can drive around freely and play online. I haven't played online since i like to play this game single player so i cant comment on that but a really great purchase. If you're still not sure if you wanna buy this game you can get the demo for free and play until level 3 and see how it is for yourself."

2875,"[h1] Wanted to like this but it is BS [/h1]

I really tried. I gave this shit numerous tries. This game is great on paper. But due to bad game design I have lost so much progress over the 90hrs that I am not willing to put out with this BS anymore. Fanboys will call me bad at driving, but whatever.

[h2] IDIOTIC AI [/h2]
AI drivers are literally blind and ram into you while you are in the middle of the turn or coming out of a yard/parking lot. Numerous times I have double-checked the road is empty, just for an AI driver to spawn in, ram into my truck and not only make ME pay the ""crash offence"" price, it sometimes even damaged my truck or trailer.

[h2] GETTING STUCK IN TEXTURES [/h2]
This is why I lost my last 2,5hrs of driving. Was doing an online job (if you crash, turn vehicle over or get stuck you lose the job). When turning to a narrow road I miscalculated and trailer touched the siderail. Normally it is not an issue you just back up a little and do it correctly.

But this time the trailer went through the guard rail partially so I could not go back. Only way was to go forward onto the narrow bridge, just to find out both ways out of that bridge are closed. Lots of traffic behind me made it impossible to reverse and bridge was so narrow I could not turn around.

And this happened to me numerous times where you get stuck in texture, or blocked by AI vehicles making it impossible to get out of the situation.

Out of my 90hrs I lost good 30 just on BS like this. Each ride is a dice roll whether you gonna finish it. With odds being stacked against you. And single player missions where you can scum save, do not count towards progress in World of Trucks so why would you play those?

[h2] LIGHTS ARE A JOKE [/h2]
Basic truck light can't illuminate for shit so unless you spend fuckload of money on extra lights, you have to use GPS at nights or you will miss the turn easily as you can't see anything except 1m in front of your truck. And just hope it is not raining!

Thank you very much, I am done and really angry I can't refund this garbage."

2879,"The best Truck Simulator available to date. Even though it is now 10+ years old It still looks really good. I would however like the cities to be more built up. When you drive into London, Paris, Berlin, etc they are just like any other city, i.e. nothing amazing. The capital cities in this game should be more built up and look amazing!. Other than that, i love this game."

2882,"My son said i should try this, he is 17 so i thought it cannot be that bad.
I tried it.. i have not played another game since (2 months and counting).
The idea of driving about trucks sounds lame, but it is not, and i really enjoy building up my business and it is now expanding fast bringing in the monies!
and thankfully with mods such as 'promods' the map is expanded and improved even further than the dlcs alone can take it.
Plus if you bring in other mods such as cars you can really enjoy the roads of Europe when you want a break from the earning.

2888,"Never thought I'd play this game, but it's surprisingly relaxing to just drive trucks while watching something in the background. That is, once you've learned how to properly drive and not crash into everything on the road.
And the attention to detail is incredible. Of course the scale is way off, and cities are smaller than in real life, but landmarks are still there, even more obscure ones. It's really cool to recognize something that you also see on your daily commute."

2908,"After 130 hours, I finally feel qualified to write a review for this. All I can say this, thank god there‚Äôs a demo, because if I hadn‚Äôt played that I probably wouldn‚Äôt have ever given this game a go. 

I had no interest I trucks whatsoever. Yet, within 5 minutes of playing the demo I felt a very strange mix of feelings - giddy excitement at just how big the game world is (especially will all the DLCs), and genuine fear of crashing as the physics felt so realistic even using an Xbox controller. And that is the thing - if you have any interest in any kind of simulator game at all, I‚Äôd be astonished if you don‚Äôt love this game. It‚Äôs the only simulator game I know of which has actually managed to mix the simulation side of things (great physics, wonderfully detailed scenery) with the ‚Äòtycoon‚Äô style business side of things, which gives your journeys actual meaning. 

It‚Äôs probably the most relaxing game I own, especially since you can listen to real internet radio stations or your own music/podcasts whilst driving. You get a real sense of place and can experience some spectacular sunsets and sunrises as you drive from one country to another. 

The scale of the map is obviously not 1:1, and it‚Äôs true that some of the cities lack character (especially UK and German which are the oldest countries in the game) as they are mostly just made up of the various cargo yards and service stations, but there are also some genuinely authentic feeling cities (I think some of the French ones are superb) and also little towns that you end up driving through randomly which adds to the realism. 

I just think everyone should try this game, even if you‚Äôre convinced you‚Äôll hate it (I was pretty sure I would) for the money it‚Äôs one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played."

3059,Maybe the best game ever and gets better with future updates and DLC's. Love driving trucks around Europe its awesome.
3060,"Definitely highly recommended especially if you love trucks and was dreaming all your life to drive one. Buy steering wheel with pedals and gear shifter and you'd feel yourself as a real truck driver. One drawback is that you don't know what to do further when you progressed far in game, explored all cargos, roads, cities. trucks, made more than enough money and so on. It's still fun to haul loads here and there but aim absense  greatly decreases your satisfaction. MODs, DLCs, convoys partially level up this bringing some more excitement, but in my opinion it needs a bit more challenging gameplay in part not just deliver loads from point A to B. Or may be I don't know something yet? Steering wheel/pedals/shifter is a must  as well as good videocard not weaker than RTX 3060 and a big screen or, better, two or three as game supports multiscreen setup - now I'm driving with 32"" Xiaomi gaming widescreen - it's good but not a setup of my dream yet."

3073,"I have played this game for a while, i bought it back in 2017 (roguhly) to get into a new genre of games. I enjoyed it for a bit due to my lack of knowledge of mods and how to use them (Yes i know very nooby of me). I stopped playing and after a sometime i came back to find alot of new dlc with a lot of content. I must say the game has improved alot, and now i enjoy my time on the game alot. Honestly if anyone is looking for a simulation game they want to try I highly recommend Euro Truck Simulator 2. This game is amazing for the funcition it was built, immersive driving with amazing scenarios and simulation of trucking. Can't wait for the third one (That is if there is one :P)"

"
3079,"[b] Beginning [/b]

The game welcomes you with a nice loading animation. You choose your character avatar, there are many of them, but they are simple. Create your company and choose one of the few logos. Choose the truck that you like the most and take training on it. At first, you drive other people's trucks, and as you earn experience, new longer routes will open up for you, for which more rewards rely. You will not even notice how in a couple of hours you will make trips to neighboring countries, instead of between cities.

[b] Gameplay [/b]

The game has acquired a bunch of mechanics all the time: air suspension, which if you do not lower it, you won't be able to hitch a trailer, power windows, wiper modes, traffic accidents due to which your planned route will have to change, changing the rigidity of the cabin and stabilizing the trailer. Also, you can take a loan from the bank and buy yourself a new truck that you dreamed about and go to private orders or expand the company by buying 1 or even 2 cheap trucks and hiring drivers for them. The game won't let you get bored with its radio, which has more than 40 stations, I think everyone will find a suitable wave for themselves and will enjoy the road. The road in the game is too monotonous for me, the same interchanges that meet one after another. In the game, you can adjust the amount of precipitation, which is a very convenient feature. If you are used to seeing rain more often than dry weather outside your window and vice versa, then in the game you can customize everything for yourself. When you are already stand firm and can afford the truck of your dreams, the game will not deprive you. Many variations of the engine, chassis, standard hood amplifiers and beacons on them. For more colorful skins, wheels and accessories, you will have to pay for the DLC. Absolutely the same with trailers, game has almost all types of trailers in the world.

[b] Traffic [/b]

The AI in the game is very well done, they use turn signals, they don‚Äôt run through red lights and they know how to brake urgently. If you have an emergency situation along the middle of the road, then when the hazard lamps are turned on, the traffic will not drive up close to you from behind, but will leave room for maneuver. I have noticed more than once that the AI is trying in every possible way to help the player when leaving the site of the nook companies by stopping and letting you go ahead. The police are present in the game, they do not have designated places where they could stand, so you meet them on the road. If you drive on the highway more than 90 km / h and the police catch up with you, they will fine you in 95 percent of cases. If you violate and drive 120 km/h and catch up with the police, who goes 110 km/h overtaking them, you will be fined in 80% of cases, but if you slow down and follow them at 110 km/h, then you won't be fined.

[b] DLC [/b]

The game has accumulated a lot of DLC, most of them are coloring pages of different countries and are simply themed. There are tuning packs that add many parts and accessories of a specific brand of truck. DLC for expanding maps has been in the game for a long time and they have already accumulated, considering the size of additional maps. Due to the huge number of DLCs, it may seem that they are expensive if you want everything at once, but individually they cost quite sane money. [u] Therefore, the developers are SCS, not Ubisoft. [/u]

[b] Online [/b]

The game has a partner ""Truckers MP"" with which you can drive in multiplayer with friends and players from all over the world, however this is just a mod and there is no traffic inside. Not so long ago, the developers added their own internal multiplayer with traffic. Playing with a friend has become much more enjoyable when there is traffic. You can create an open server and wait for new people and make new friendship, or make a closed lobby and arrange a private convoy of up to 10 people, and that's all with traffic!

[b] Conclusion [/b]

If you are a fan of the auto industry, auto simulators and want to safely drive around Europe, then the game is worth the money. The developers were able to make a game where you can relax, immerse yourself in your thoughts and watch a beautiful picture. Personally, I liked the game for its simplicity, which lies in a bunch of little things.

P.S. at the time of writing the review, I have played more than 3k hours on the second account.

- other cars will drive straight into you when you f.e. try to leave compound,
- while I was making a narrow turn bus literally drove straight into my trailer like it wasn't there,
- roundabouts in the cities are a Russian roulette minigame,
- while you drive along highway other drivers will change lanes and hit you,
- got 25% damage to my truck when I dinked into a caravan trailer that was moving on lane next to me (so relative speed speed so around 15-20 kmh),
- I can't even recall how many times my truck just flew into the air when I scraped on the barriers between lanes on highway ending up with 60-80% damage,
- the uneven traffic generator: you can get massive traffic in the middle of nowhere at 3 AM and absolutely nobody at the same place in the middle of the day,
- sometimes complete f*cked up traffic generator: I got stuck while making turn at junction in industrial area at about 5 AM and suddenly there were several cars in all of streets around me, so I couldn't even back up or move forward without hitting anyone,
- I built and maxed garages in every city available in the basic game only to find out that... there are not enough drivers in the game to fill all the vacancies.

I quite liked the first game, it was simple, it was boring, it was pointless, this one is more complicated, in many ways far better, but the creators seems to be completely focused on selling DLCs and some silly graphic improvements than fixing the basics of the game."

3110,"game is very good

3111,"Really good game.  With a steering wheel and a podcast in the background, its the best way to relax for me. The built in trucks are really good and the graphics are amazing, and mod compatability is a huge plus."

10/10"
3122,yes
3123,Cool and chilling game.
3124,"Zen game to chill out on. People laugh at the thought of relaxing in a game by driving trucks delivering cargo, but they don't understand until they have played this game."
3125,This game will never be the old..Timeless beauty..
3126,"Fun game for a while but quickly gets repetitive, some suggestions that I have:
¬∑50% price for all DLCs, because they are too expensive to consider at the current time of writing this review.
¬∑Upscale at least a bit the graphics.
¬∑Add more buildings and such to the environment.
¬∑Add events such as car crashes that make traffic congestions or other stuff.
Although, this game is fun with friends, if you have friends it is a 8/10, if not, 6/10."
3127,Great truck game
3128,"yes

"
3129,"best game ever

history games go poo mode"
3130,"SCS pretty much have truck sim sewn up with this and ATS. 

ETS2 is probably the best starting point for any would be virtual trucker. Not only has it forged the blueprint of all of SCS offerings since, it's probably the most complete of all of them. With the base game offering a fairly substantial map of Europe and numerous expansions. On top of that there are literally hundreds of MODs that have been developed over the last decade. Ranging from liveries to entire new maps.

So what is so appealing about SCS's offerings? Well they are the perfect blend of accessibility and sim. From a keyboard to a full wheel set up there is plenty that can be gotten from ETS2(and ATS) whatever your skill level.On top of that SCS have rendered some fantastic scenery with recognisable landmarks. Which makes ETS2 the perfect game to slap on a pod cast and just chill as you cruise across the continent.

ETS2 is regularly on sale, so do keep a look out. However despite being almost a decade old now, it sill holds up even at its full price.  SCS still drop updates for the game and have new DLC planned."
3131,Its nice.
3132,"very guud
"
3133,Good game!
3134,I have close to 8000 hours in ETS2 for a reason. It's a brilliant game.
3135,"A very fun simulation game about driving trucks through highways, best played with a joystick or steering wheel (never tried myself)"
3136,great game
3137,10/10
3138, tokyo drift vroom vroom
3139,Must play game
3140,"-Relaxing game, nice to listen to radio whilst driving
-Wide variety of places to explore
-You can drive a variety of different trucks and trailers, and slowly hire more drivers to build your empire
-Unique deliveries such as the special transports (if you buy the DLC)
-The AI cars can sometimes be a bit unpredictable
-Some of the cities look better than others
-I would say if you are thinking of buying a DLC, wait until it is on sale as they are a bit overpriced"

3154,Pretty fuckin boring tbh
3155,Nice driving sim
3156,W
3157,If you love simulator games then you should definitely buy this game. If you're after multiplayer then there is an official multiplayer known as convoys that's still quite new and have a small player cap. They'll increase it eventually but I don't think it'll ever be like the TtuckersMP mod which supports thousands of players in a server. Still an amazing game in singleplayer though.
3158,pula
3159,great game if you like lorries and driving them realisticly.

3176,"Already have 8 garages and nearly $10 million in ATS. ETS2 is a little, just a little , tougher. Have 6 garages but are earning at over EUR 1.1 million per week. Best things in ETS2 are that gameplay is on the one hand intense with time, traffic and tiredness being the enemy, and, on the other hand, is relaxed and immersive, with places to go, things to do, and , best of all, you can build up your business with little problem. The following are highly recommended:
- upgrade the trucks to reward the best drivers. When the company is doing well, upgrade everything before buying more garages.
- buy trailers only if you really want to- there is little business sense as the jobs you can do get limited.
- get your truck report by fast travel after each job.
- you can tone down or turn off the annoyances such as weather events, diversions, road events, fines for speeding and fines crashing into others. But speed limit warnings and fatigue simulation should be there. Damage cannot be turned off. 
- the best roads are in Norway but they are usually two lane only.
- the best highways are, of course, in Germany, but the speed limit is 80 kmph
- there are way too many toll booths in France. But the max speed of 90kmph is there on all highways.
- crossing Britain is really easy as all the towns are bypassed by the highways.
- there is really great fun in doing ferry crossings. You can drive onto the ship usually. The crossing takes place off-game but the time on ferries counts towards rest stops.
- things I like- crossing the bridges from Denmark to Sweden, the winding roads in Corsica and Sicily, driving through the town in Vienna, looking for landmarks like the gherkin in London, Eiffel in Paris, Munich Stadium (beautiful at night), the massive topiary bull on the approach to Madrid, the roundabouts inside the tunnels in Norway. Always blow the horn in the alps tunnels to hear the echoes.

Great fun. Buy all the DLCs.

Good game, I play it with low graphics and I still find the graphics very good. I love how much developers have added detail to the trucks and stuff.

The last delivery I made I stopped outside the delivery point gates to check how much time I had left.....1 hour 15 mins. Drove in, went through uncoupling procedure only to  find I was LATE and had 15,000 Euros deducted! One journey from Glasgow to Birmingham apparently took 23 HOURS and again lost money as I was late!!  
The game is reasonably accurate (I drove Artics for many many years) except for the aforementioned  accurate timings."

3266,am ready to take my c category hehe
3267,"i like this game a lot because of the realism of some of the mechanics such as the exploration and the vehicles feel when driving as well as having to hook up the trailer. there are a lot of places to explore and drive to however i would have liked the game more if i could have visited ireland and northern ireland as they are both parts of europe and the UK, even it they were added as a DLC i would buy them just to be able to visit those areas."

3269,Awesomeness
3270,"The game is amazing.
You can do many things from working at a company to having your own.
There are many goods to transport and you can also play the multiplayer version (Truckers Mp).
Which is free.
Overall you should really buy it 10/10.

3296,"There is so many different ways to play. 1. You can play it realistically, following traffic laws, stopping to sleep and using your turn signal. 2. You can turn off laws and drive dangerously, still trying not to hit other cars. 3. You can install a mod where your truck does not take damage from the easy to use workshop and mod manager. Now you can drive down highways ramming every car off the road just so and IKEA can get carbonated water. The map and DLCs are beautiful and well thought out. 10/10"

3299,"Absolutely the best driving simulator I have ever encountered. I think the fact that it is a single game that gets updates over many years is one of the reasons it is so well-made. Compare that to driving simulators that release a ""new"" game every few years with pretty much the same content but with an updated year in the name, a few features removed and added, a new yet not bigger map and an inevitable UI overhaul.
Euro Truck Simulator 2 offers an immensely huge map (I bought all of the map expansion DLCs and the base game during a sale for dirt cheap) with satisfying roads and a huge variety of trucks to purchase. It also offers valuable customizability and flexibility in the controls and settings. Euro Truck Simulator 2 is THE game to relax on and clear your mind. I even managed to use it as a ""tactical distraction"" years ago for memorizing vocabulary without noticing that an hour passed and I actually made progress.
Thanks to the game being ""old"", it gathered a really great and dedicated modding community that comes up with a lot of mods that really enhance the driving experience by a lot such as mods that significantly improve the graphics and the textures, add AI vehicles and change AI behaivour. People even created web-apps that connect to your game and allow you to utilize an old tablet that's been laying around for years as an actual dashboard for your truck!
Something that you can find in great mods by the community that I would like to see implemented in the base game is the ability to adjust the traffic intensity since the traffic on the roads often doesn't feel satisfying enough.
A huge turn-off for me, regarding mods, is that you cannot play multiplayer (Native or TruckersMP) with mods that do not affect the game but only make local changes such as graphics mods since it either is completely impossible on TruckersMP or on native multiplayer requires everyone you play with to have the exact same mods, which is very inconvenient and often impossible with local mods that are not available on the Steam Workshop.
Another worth-mentioning point is that while the AI feels pretty authentic on single-player, on TruckersMP, which does not contain AI vehicles at all, you will be driving through empty roads and seeing a truck every minute or so, possibly driving on the opposite side of the road. When you do encounter other people driving around, they will most likely be stuck at some weird intersection in a situation that would not happen in real-life.
Something I appreciated as a kid, playing this years ago for a couple of hundreds of hours is that the graphics are not insane and your computer or even laptop are very likely to be able to deliver satisfying performance, but at the same time if you have a more powerful machine - you can download mods that significantly enhance the graphics and it no longer feels like an ""old"" game.
I play this game with my mouse which is surprisingly comfortable for me and encouraged me to use mouse steering on other driving simulators as well, even though they don't manage to do it as well as Euro Truck Simulator 2 does since it has a setting called ""Steering non-linearity"" which I have never encountered in any other driving simulator and makes the steering using a mouse make much more sense as it adapts the sensitivity of the mouse according to the speed of the truck. That way, you can make more precise corrections to the steering wheel on a highway, but also comfortably navigate inside cities.
Driving in this game feels the closest I know to real-life driving, and I wish other driving simulators could use the same base of the game and its features instead of creating their own."
3300,Good simulation of driving trucks
3301,"I find this game relaxing and calming to play in my humble opinion. HOWEVER... When doing a 130,000 euro 56 hour drive, and at the end... I DON'T want to loose 80,000 euros in damage because I touched but a petulant curb and my employers Truck flipped over... Overall I'm satisfied."

3328,"a very nice game to play with your friends

3329,"It is a pretty good sim, realistic and very beautiful."
3330,"Roses are red,violets are blue why not buy, ets2

This is a semi realistic simulator in which delivers this is a 10/10 game for visuals game-play  you can also enhance your gameplay even further by buying yourself a steering wheel ranging from ¬£250 and above for the better ones however this game also has conveys lets you play with your friends online recently added so only hosts up to 8 people, however there is truckers mp which also lets you play with your friends but hundreds to thousands more people in a server at a time all in all i rate this game 100/100 as it is a quick and easy game for new and experienced simulator players to get a grip with this game so i also recommend to new people in the simulator community 

Hope you enjoy your recently purchased game (or not) . Bye Everyone thanks for reading :)

3338,I can't stay home... I'm a trucker
3339,"nice game for chill <3

3342,I really enjoy this game. Its Great!!!
3343,top <3
3344,Love hitting cars 10/10
3345,"This game is one of the best games that car enthusiasts can play, along with many other, but this one is just... Special. With many trucks to choose from and different locations to go, connect your steering wheel, pedals and shifter and head on to the big adventure awaiting you. Make money, play with friends and many more."

3348,This game is the best it cured my depression.
3349,not the best quality playing on mac but that is my computer not the games issue. 5 hours in and barely scraped the surface of what can be done on the game.
3350,gud
3351,very good game
3352,Epic gameplay
3353,A great medium for chilling with friends. No too intensive and just enough canvas to make your own fun.
3354,"I don't even care about trucks. Why did I spend 4 real time hours driving from Istanbul to Germany? What even is this game, and why can't I stop playing it?"
3355,The best trucking game. I would love to see a bus simulator from SCS.
3356,"ETS is an amazing simulator, same goes for ATS. Great wheel support, customization and game modding support w/ steam workshop. The World of Trucks profile synchronization is pretty neat and useful for sharing stats/screenshots with friends/other users. As for gameplay, It's a great experience and very immersive. The DLC is worth picking up on sale, as well as the accessory packs if you like them. Looking forward to putting more hours into these games :)"
3357,"Pros:
- Any more realistic and you'll need a commercial truck license.
- Perhaps, the cheapest way to explore European roads without flying (for most)
Cons:
- You may need mods to enjoy it more.
- Does not model weather. Some countries, especially in the Alps, often close sections of road in heavy snow.
- Does not model road conditions, which can be bad or good. Some countries, especially parts of Eastern Europe, don't have well maintained roads.

Not bad, I enjoy this game. It is probably the cheapest way for an American to tour Europe without leaving home - and make ""deliveries"" too."
3358,good
3359,"love it

3360,This game is fucking fire I had my doubts about it at first but its fun as hell especially if you download truckersmp and its also just fun to listen to music on spotify while driving
3361,nice game
3362,"This game has come a very long way! It's constantly improving and becoming more and more realistic with each update. It has a very easy to use setup wizard which supports almost every control scheme you could imagine. The game also runs well most of the time, even at high settings. Overall a fun game to play if you are into sims, or just want something to play to relax and enjoy a single player game."

Indeed, there are many more things to add to the game to make it perfect. So this game is worth the money and the DLCs are well done"
3416,What's up guys Michael Niger here today I'm going to show you how to fuck a briefcase with a handful with a metal or minion shirt case in the Pennsylvania Road against the i-85 road that goes up to your mouths occurs pretty unfortunately pretty much ask me but there's a retarded right it's not quite working I'll talk to
3417,"I say it's a great game for people who are not competitive and want to relax. There's a huge world that you can explore, with amazingly beautiful scenes, A good collection of trucks, decent level progression, and then the satisfaction of doing a 1-2 hour long (in reality) journey without a single ticket or scratch to your truck. Can get a little boring for people who want something or the other to happen every time. I say that you either turn the radio on or put up your favourite podcast on the background and go trucking! And with the addition of convoys, a great game became way better."
3418,Great game :)
3419,yes
3420,"It's very fun, but the thing that makes it more better and fun with people is that it's graphics and engines and all of that developing script or anything makes it very fun, i recommend you play this!"
3421,This game is an excellent trucking experience....If you love trucking this is the game you wanna get and also its DLCs are best. Highly recommended !!!

3460,Yes

3462,"This game is okay. 

I mean okay in the sense that it's only okay if you have no friends and play alone in your sad, dark, and depressing basement owned by your mum. You can easily spend several hours driving pathetic virtual trucks and not notice the piss leaking onto the carpet below from one of your bottles. 

The real pain starts when you decide to play with friends- or worse, on truckersmp. Your gaming session will start of with the comforting delusion that you'll be having a nice time with the homies. But, do not be fooled: doom, pain, suffering, and the overwhelming desire to off yourself awaits you. You'll be satisfied in a happy clappy universe on your rainbow-coloured unicorn of delusion before you spiral into the deepest pits of humanity and helplessly fall into a depressing path of destruction. You will breathe pure fury and your eyes will seek only for murder. Your breath - which only moments before consisted of the most vile scent of cheetos - turns into an ever-increasing fireball of pure hatred. Your mum will enter your basement to let you know your chicken nuggets are ready but you will only hear the taunting laughter of a toddler. You will wreak havoc and everything you touch will turn into ash. You will not see the devil as for you are the devil. You will not be the personification of evil as for you are the evil. You will assure that pain does not become a concept to people but rather becomes their only reality as they beg you for release. Your name no longer becomes recognisable to you and you'll only respond to the crying of those who you torture. Your face warps into a disfigured Guy Fawkes mask. 

And then you'll call it a day and repeat everything tomorrow. 10/10"

3494,"Awesome game that you can have loads of fun with if you want something a bit more relaxing than sweat filled FPS lobbies or tryhard RTS ones. It's literally just a game where you drive a truck around and manage your income and expenses, the mods that you can add to the game are also amazing especially the TruckersMP which lets you play with around 1000+ other people. I would recommend buying a DLC to go with the base game though, it just expands upon the base game by adding new countries for you to explore."

3504,"The game is simple and relaxing. Is friendly to beginner who never play this game and easy to follow. The map is pretty big on original game (not including dlc maps). This game also has various mods you can install. For multiplayer, there are 2 options. First option is convoy mode (is on the game already, you dont need to install aditional mods to play it). Second option is TruckerMP, you need to install truckerMP mods to play it. 

Although the game is good already, there is some i want the developer to add to make the game more good. Like add some new truck (some truck are too old, Iveco is one of the example), improve the graphic setting (add some puddle when rain is a enough to increase the game experience)"
3505,very good game
3506,"Just put on your fav relaxing music and forget about allllll your real life worries and focus on paying off that 400K$ loan, the one that you used to buy em garages and trucks, yeah i'm looking at the future YOU. Good Luck :))
Anyways, i love this game. It looks good enough, runs well and is calming but what really got me interested in this game is its huge map as i love cruising, been a long time (TDU2) since i played a game this chill. You can even run a truck fleet of yours if you git gud but it takes a lot of time. And apparently there's a lot of modding potential for this thing too but i haven't gotten into that yet, thou i have the impression that it'll make this game even better than it already is. 10/10."

3527,great game
3528,If you like trucks and driving long distances this game is definitely for you! I would consider this to be the best truck game on steam (as well as american truck sim) it is differently a must for all truck fans.
3529,"Very realistic experience at being a truck driver.
The detailedness of the map should be increased. (size of cities, number of cities)"
3530,Finally understand why there's so much hype around this game!! Only played for 10 hours but I can see myself playing it for 10 years!! It's truly remarkable!!! Thank you to the Devs for this masterpiece :)
3531,"Very nice game, Im going to play it another time because its fun and good when you are bored"
3532,recommended to one who loves chill driving across Europe
3533,"This game on its own is fantastic. It nails what it was made to do with that being driving a truck around Europe.

Now I started playing this game on keyboard and it was pretty bad to be honest so I spent around 5 hours on keyboard before grabbing an old Xbox 360 controller and using that which made the experience 10x better, I could smoothly change lanes turning wasn't all or nothing I had the ability to turn smoothly.
At the point I had put around 50 hours in and then learned of how much this game had been modded both on and off the steam workshop, there are new maps, more detailed version of the vanilla map, new trucks, cars, AI diversity, Lighting, Graphics you name it and it's probably been modded there is also a mod which turns the game into an MMO basically.

Now when I got to 100 hours I decided to take the plunge and got myself a wheel, pedals and shifter which just improved the game, even more, I have perfect input for small changes, and the force feedback makes even the smallest of bumps important to look out for, the control of gears while taking heavy cargo up a hill or offroad it's just amazing and add in the fact that you can play this game in VR! The immersion is just out of this world.

If you have ever wanted to drive a truck around Europe but not leave the comfort of your own home then this game is for you and if you get bored of driving around Europe hop on over to America with American Truck Simulator both games are the exact same thing but each has their own atmosphere around them with how the laws are, roads you drive on, trucks, AI traffic, Cargo you take and the trailers that are used.

This is a godlike game and a must have if you love sim driving/racing games and just want to relax while in a VC for hours."

3537,"Its a very good simulator game!
I really like the real life truck sounds!
Can't wait to try American Truck Simulator!"
3538,"i got this game for christmas 2013 along with ets1 and scania truck simulator. i was young and did not quite understand the mechanics, so ets2 kinda got forgotten for some years, until recently, now that i'm done with school and i finally got time to invest some hours into this game, i realise how amazing this simple truck simulator actually is, and this game fits for every type of plater

you can haul cargo from portugal to finland while relaxing with a podcast or something playing in the backround, which i find very relaxing

or, you can download truckersmp and experience psycological horrors and moments of frustration that will increase your blood-pressure as you face 5 trucks overtaking eachother on a narrow two-lane road and get flung into the stratosphere as your truck hits 100% damage just from the turbulence.

overall 12/10 could not reccomend this masterpiece more"
3539,yes
3540,game is really good 10/10
3541,"very good game
"
3542,"Did you want to be a truck driver when you were a kid? Well now you can live out those fantasies without the costly licences or the required beer gut.

Want to pimp up your 'cab' then got for it....

Want to drive long distances but are sick of EU regulations forcing you to drive no more than 9 hours? 
Get this and drive all day (Not recommended)

So pick up your wheel, controller or god forbid your keyboard and blast across Europe with no regard for traffic, public safety or yourself.

this isn't a very informative review"
3579,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

3581,"Since I use a wireless Xbox One controller I have to use Steam controller configuration. FIne.
But every time this game updates, my control config becomes incompatible and I have to redo them. With how many controls there are, this is a gigantic pain in the ass and really puts me off from this game."
3582,this is an amazing game! i love it.
3583,I think 1 thing they need to add is severs that has no mods just for people who want to chill
3584,"Do you like sims, trucks, driving and just plain old good fashioned work fun well then ETS2 is the game for you. If you are mildly interested wait for a sale otherwise you will get your moneys worth out of the game and more."
3585,beep beep
3586,very chill game to play
3587,its fun
3588,"What a game. I've burnt so much time travelling around Europe. This is a no brainier, if somehow you don't own this game where have you been?"
3589,Noice
3590,"such a great game, give me relax after work but on truckerMP is way great with friends!

i‚Äôd rate this game a solid 8.5/10
it worth it must buy but it really suck on M&K better on steel wheel an gear way better!"
3591,"pretty good but kinda boring game, maybe will not be boring for you if you have good wheel like G29 or G920
or any pro racig wheel with MORE THAT 180¬∞ stearing.

I have urage gripz 500 (not so good wheel)"
3592,"I love it a lot I crashed into a police car and they just let me drive away, you can literally get away with anything and everything in this game 10/10 would recommend"
3593,"This is an amazing game with great amounts of reality, Europe looks somewhat like it does today, adding beautiful sites, and the DRIVING IS SO REALISTIC! I suggest what you should do once you join is take a LOAN from the BANK once it pops up in your email, and buy your first truck by taking a 100k Loan, I personally bought a daf. I love this game, and I hope to keep on playing it for years to come, I suggest you look into mods to ehance the game as well!

100% RECOMMENDATION!"
3594,trust me... This is awsome<3
3595,so realistic
3596,"It's a really good and fun game that runs on great pretty good even on low end PC's.
It can feel repetitive at times though. 
"
3597,Actual Good Game - 8/10. Would have rated this game way lower if it did not have the radio. The country song at the background while I drive this digital truck for hours on end is really something else.
3598,da
3599,best thing ever
3600,"recommend, because it is good"
3601,The best game ever made.
3602,"GOOD 20/15, not 15/20, but 20/15"
3603,nice
3604,"When my friends chose to buy random FPS games (in which you shoot everyone else to get the #1 position), I chose to buy this. And I haven't regretted buying it a bit.
So what's this game about? Well, driving trucks. That's it. No hopping out of the driver's seat, no thinking about when you'll have lunch or dinner. [i]Just driving trucks[/i]. 
You keep driving your truck across the continent of Europe. You start with delivering cargo on the company's truck ([i]this is a good time to test various truck designs[/i]). You slowly make enough money to buy your own truck, or just get a loan instead. You make more deliveries and your rating (and XP) slowly increases. You learn to maneuver tight corners when delivering big construction equipment or even boats. You slowly find yourself wanting to transition from just being a truck driver to becoming an entrepreneur of sorts. You purchase a 2nd truck and hire another driver. You then realise that even though the driver is working and bringing in profits, you can never actually 'see' the driver or that truck in person!! Even when the truck is parked in the garage, you still can't see the truck in the garage!
Ok, so that's how you have become a smallish entrepreneur. Then slowly you begin climbing the ladder. More truck, more hired drivers, more places explored, all that stuff. The 'mouse steering' option kinda doesn't seem like enough, you begin to crave for something more. Something better. Something more realistic. A 'steering wheel', to be precise. In short, you begin to fall in love with the game.

Alright, that's enough storytelling from my side, now let's get to the pros and cons.
Pros:
1. [b]It's the kind of game that brings peace[/b] to my life. Whenever I get stressed out, I fire up this game. There's something about peacefully driving a truck on cruise control across a beautiful 6-lane highway. It calmes me down.
2. [b]There's no end to this game.[/b] It seems like a real job. It's not like you put in x no. of hours or complete y chapters and everything's complete. Even if you seem to be at the 'end' of the game because you got a garage full of fully upgraded trucks and have explored the full map, SCS will push out an update/DLC that'll get you back on the road sooner than you think.
3. [b]The options and places to explore are endless.[/b] You think that you've explored 100% of the map? Think again. Go back, I'm sure you get atleast a dozen places you haven't explored yet. Go explore them now!
4. [b]Exceptional compatibility[/b]. Let me elaborate this a bit. I bought this game on Steam back when I used Windows 10. But since I'm kinda a tech nerd, I recently said Windows bye-bye and made the switch to Linux. And guess what? Euro Truck Simulator 2 [b]works on Linux flawlessly and with no crashes[/b].
I also got it running on the M1 macBook Pro one of my relatives bought a while ago, and this game ran there without issues as well.
Also this game supports low-end hardware pretty well. I played it on my old trusty Intel Pentium G2030 with 4GB of RAM. It ran fine on low settings & 720p. This game seems to work just about everywhere. [b]Hats off to SCS for pulling this off![/b] :)
I can't recommend this game enough. Go on. Buy this game when it's on sale. Get your friends on it. It's well worth it.
It gets a [b]10/10[/b] from my side. Have fun!"
3605,Nice calm game to pass time :)
3606,"i really like this game but i have problem with the crahe every time i open the game after like 20 mins the game crache

do you have the solution"
3607,A chill game for when you want to relax.
3608,its a alright game
3609,"Absolutely beautiful trips, if you can't afford to travel to Europe. Very detailed and VERY addicting!"
3610,gaga
3611,"It's game, where you are a truck driver, in Europe, and this is a simulation which is the 2nd of it's kind. Yup it gives what it says in the title and somehow very therapeutic."
3612,"FOR MANUAL TRANSMISION DRIVERS!!!

just make sure to disable sticky key in windows
its been like multiple times i crashed my truck because i spammed shift key to change gear and stupid windows popup right on my face and when i go back into the game my truck is already fucked in middle of highway

3626,"I really love how the game is open map and you can almost travel anywhere. If I could change some things about the game I would make it so that there is more action with the police and firemen with emergency calls and physically pulling you over, ect."

3643,"* If someone hits you from behind, he will not pay for causing damage to your truck + you will get a 500 euro bill for him breaking your truck
* If you are driving straight in a highway and you are passing a truck, the truck on your left just suddenly switches the lane and hits you! Whose fault is that? Yours for sure :), u will get a bill for that plus your truck, trailer and your package get's fucked in a random place, at kilometer of 491 out of 1900km.

Yeah, enjoy the game!"
3644,funny
3645,really realistic and fun to play.
3646,"If you want to take a step back from all the live-service games and just relax this is the game for you: Endlessly driving around accurate roads of Europe with or without  your friends  while listening to a good playlist of music
 
At first, the game is a bit difficult, but after you buy your first truck it becomes very easy.
The sense of progression it this game starts very soon, expanding your company with new drivers and truck and leveling up and unlocking better trucks

The best part of this game is it's dedicated comunity, who always add new mods that refresh the gamplay with new trucks, accessories and tuning parts.

This game helped me a lot during covid curfews as well as when I wasn't feeling like going outside. 

I absolutely adore travelling Europe in my Volvo truck whilst listening to various songs, feeling like a real trucker (less pedophilia and spitting) and just enjoying the open road. 

Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes driving but lacks purpose, you do have purpose in this game, you are earning money for your logistics company. 

PLUS it is now easier to play online through forming convoys w/ your friends so there's that. 

Go buy this game, play, drive idc. (8,5/10)"

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

3799,Êàë‰∏ç‰ºöÂºÄËΩ¶  T T
3800,Great game! Love the game play mechanics for an older sim game.
3801,"A hesitant recommendation. 

Pros: 
1. I played in VR for about 10hrs, then I went and picked up a u-haul trail irl. It was the first time in 15-20 years since I had driven a truck and trailer back on the farm. On my first attempt, I backed up the u-haul trailer at a right-angle into my driveway which is on a slight incline, and continued into my garage with only about 2-4 inches of side clearance from the trailer's wheel wells. This was all in one go. I thank ETS2 for that.

2. Get to drive a big rig.

3. Truck comes with a radio for some country hits and 80s power ballads.

Cons:
1. Just like riding and driving a semi irl, it isn't always the most fun thing to putz around and do. The whole gig is romanticized.  I grew up  with a couple trucker's in my life, and it seemed cool as a kid until I took a couple trips.

2. The cities in the game suck. No semblance of care has been put into making any of these cities look like there local. The cities all look the same. A handful of roads, some warehouses, some motel signs.... yeah, that's it. Heck, there's not even a trickle of water in Venice, Italy. No toll to drive the unloading dock outside the city. Nothing. Just same old, same old as every other city.

3. 50% of the time there is a wreck on the final exit ramp for your delivery, and if you decide to drive around you are looking at another 10-15mins of ""real-life driving"" and 2-5 extra hours of in-game driving. So yeah, just squeeze thru the barricade.

4. Can't stop at the Gas Stations for Road Dogs ...you know hot dogs on the road.

5. Can't stop at Truck Stops for Road Head ...you know head on the ....nvm. inappropriate.

6. If you want more Cons, just hit up the Negative Reviews there's loads of complaints about how shallow the game is under the hood."
3802,Best Simulator
3803,i crash too much in this game
3804,VROOM VRRROOOOMM VRRRRRROOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMM
3805,Good Game

I definitely recommend buying it"

3860,"not had this game long but  really love the realism. just added a few mods and wow this game is  never ending.
just need to fine tune a few settings but getting there. i think I'm going to be on this game for quite some time . totally recommend this game i got it at a steal  in a sale . cheapest game i have bought but by far the best so far."
3861,"I will not talk about how good that game because its a very good one.This is a very good game if you can play with your friend,you can all relax while driving together.Of course is not that fun playing alone but its still fine altought you can only drive.The steering wheel system is also good,actually i dont have one but I played with it at on my friend's PC and it was awsome,the way you could optimize the gameplay was very elaborated.In counclusion I have only good words to say about this game.I'm not surprised that is the 2nd most played game from my steam library.Euro Truck simulator 2(ETS2) deservse my positive review!"
3862,It's really good. If u want to enjoy the game completely buy the DLC's. Worth it
3863,"Honestly I am not a big trucking fan but this is a hell of a simulator, love the way you can interact with other people and how good the driving mechanics are. 10/10."
3864,This is the best simulation game i have ever played. I really enjoy this game. Even though i don't really like the truck sound because it's not realistic. I recommend using truck sound mod
3865,gg
3866,yes
3867,24hrs a day isn't enough
3868,"i got this game on a whim during the summer sale and was suprised how fast i got in to playing the game. it's quite a easy and simple game but it dosent need to be to as good and relaxing as it is. the most complex thing is the amount of detail they put in to game with the seanery, controls, trucks, and dlc. you dont even need to mess with any of them too much. they even alow mods so you can improve on what they already give you which even though you dont realy need to its super fun. the bigest down side is the money and its not that it isint worth it more like you can start spending alot with dlc and controlers to improve your experience. but in the end your spending it cause its a good game"
3869,yis yis veri guut you can not run over jeze so gud
3870,This game is the best especially if you install TruckersMP and visit Calais.
3871,ye
3872,Good Game
3873,"Can be a relaxing experience if you dont stress on the cargo your carrying (talking about you, explosive cargo). Seeing a different country from the window of my truck is such a unique experience (and much cheaper than traveling there), but it has helped me add a few places to my bucket list of vacation destinations."
3874,extra
3875,good
3876,"i liked this one so much, i bought a trucker hat and grew a handle bar mustache for the ride."
3877,"Very reccomend for those who wants a relaxing experience and visit some cities around Europe. Also is  one of the best driving simulators out there, if you have a racing sim setup, you should try this out. 

Rating: 8.5/10"

3907,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

4042,"good game man, like it"
4043,Good Game
4044,Its really fun if u like driving and doing missions while driving
4045,"Strangely calming and satisfying this sim is perfect to chill from life and just drive around Europe for the fun of it. It makes you want to buy a truck and live a simpler life (bet in real life it's truly challenging and stressful - but in my office, bit less!)."
4046,There is a bug/problem with ETS2 - i have run out of drivers for hire in the agency. Does anyone have a solution for this?
4047,i really like this game because it simulates reality very good.i will reccomend to you all this game and its worth buying
4048,like this game a lot its very good and very nice to play
4049,Great game to chill out to
4050,"Had hours of fun with this game, a fantastic way to relax and forget about your stressful day.
scenery and graphics in the game are awesome."

4056,"A couple trips in and I'm actual surprised how easy this game was to get used to (in third person at first but now first person as well).  It was a little intimidating at first but after following the tutorial and watching a couple YouTube videos, I'm very happy with how I'm able to pick up this game quickly; and I'm playing with a keyboard and mouse.  Definitely worth the money (and I'd recommend picking up the 'Map Pack' bundle to expand you're map selection to start).  Lots of fun to be had here, great game play, and beautiful scenery.

Just kick back, drive and listen to the massive selection of in-game internet radio stations.  I'm not saying I'd enjoy being a IRL trucker in the EU, but this game is even more enjoyable than I was anticipating.  Well worth it."
4057,It is very entertaining!!
4058,"I tried the demo and love it ¬°¬° Thats why I bought it the summer sale adding the scandinavian roads, If are the ones who enjoy driving in GTA or doing taxi missions or simulators this one is for you."
4059,My business may be failing but I'm having a great time
4060,me like to drive big trucks but in europe vroom vroom
4061,i like how the game works
4062,There is a bug with this game and I do not write to me how many hours I have in it and says that I played last year. I've been playing this for 100 hours so not cool
4063,I first started playing American Truck Simulator and loved it. So I was curious about Euro Truck Simulator and fell in love with this game as well. Cool trucks and beautiful scenery!
4064,obviously it's the best racing game ever
4065,XD
4066,i like truck :)

4068,"Ingredients For Lean Making:
If you are looking forward how to make lean, below is the list of all the things that are a prerequisite for preparing this drink:

Promethazine
Codeine
Prescribed cough syrup, the primary ingredient
Sprite
Styrofoam cup
Jolly rancher candies (optional)
Styrofoam cup
Jolly rancher candies (optional)
Guidelines On How To Prepare Lean:
Pour a bottle of sprite in your styrofoam cup. You can buy this cup from any liquid store.
Next to that, add the syrup in the cup and mix it in and out.
You can add few Jolly Ranchers which can bring some additional taste in the drink. Shake it in thoroughly.
You can add the volume of syrup and sprite in accordance with your choice.
Though sprite confers a classic taste to the drink, you can also try cherry soda or Mountain Dew for a change.
The cough syrup, you should be using must contain promethazine. Promethazine contributes to being the right and active ingredient and you cannot prepare lean without the use of it.

Don‚Äôt consume the drink in overdosage. Take in small quantity to enjoy it.

The drink makes you slow. So you should refrain from driving or any such work that needs more focus and concentration."
4069,so relaxing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! fr fr
4070,"OK so ive been playing this game for 5 years straight and oh buy what a ride it has been. Its a decent truck sim that has been kept alive for 10 years straight at this point not only by the game devs making the game, but the absolutely insane mod support this game has. The sheer amount of mods available for this game is impressive to say the least, only helped by the fact that SCS themselves know that without mod support this game would have already died 5 years ago. So the tools to add content to this game are easily obtainable. Overall its one of the games that I bought that I really don't regret paying for as it payed off immensely with the endless amount of content being added to the game by both SCS and the modding community."

4081,I LOVE DRIV
4082,Best game ever !
4083,"What i have to say about this game is that it's a very good game for people that enjoy driving but don't want to get out of their house, and also for people that enjoy slow pace simulator games. So far i like the game, i play it on keyboard and mouse and it's not bad like people think it is, sometimes it's even better to play on keyboard and mouse than a low budget wheel. I do not recommend cheating cuz it defeats the purpose of the game, because if you don't need money you will not drive, and free roaming around europe is fun but still their are countless other games meant for JUST driving, and one more thing about having ‚àû money is that traffic rules lose their point and punishment mean nothing.

That's all from me, overall this game is very good if or if not you have a wheel."

4132,"This game is a masterpiece it's two simulators in one: a driving simulator and a consequence simulator.

You decided to get behind the wheel of wagon to deliver 20 tonne of concrete across Germany after 10 pints? Well you'll wake up finding your career ruined after you drunkenly ploughed down the autobahn the wrong way, at 100mph writing yourself and many unfortunate souls off in the process has consequences: you bank is empty and your staff have fucked off because there is no money to pay them. 

Texting at 100mph while going south bound on the M5 to get to London? Daft sod, you've just caused a 20 car collision and now your trucks in Calais. 

You thought that car would wait at that junction considering it's been sat there for 10 seconds while you approached and are now basically in-front of them? Nah mate, it's just like real like and the silly cunts gonna drive himself right under your wheels.

11/10 - Would turn limiter off and cause havoc again.

4170,"When this game first came out, anyone who grew up with PC gaming in the late 90's/early 2000's, would look at this game and expect to find it, in the ¬£4.99 wired basket bins in PC World. It was the sort of game, that was a throwaway game, you'd only pick up, if you absolutely loved the genre and you'd expect a couple of hours play from it.

However, over the years SCS has developed it to a point, where it is so much more that that.

Graphically, yes it looks good, but not stunning. AI Cars/Trucks, can still move strangely, let's say and of course just despawn, which is common in games like this.  

Game play wise, it can be grindy, pick up a cargo, drop it off and rinse repeat. After a while though you get enough money for your own truck and start to build your business.

Yes it can still be grindy from this point, but if you are into your trucks, you want to collect them and upgrade and customise them.

For the rest of us, who like driving games, it can be a nice relaxing game to pick up and play for a couple of hours now and then."

4189,"So my thoughts on Euro Truck Simulator 2. it has very good experience, especially when you're playing with wheel, the game doesn't get boring, especially you're playing with friends or TruckersMP client, about TruckersMP i can say that there is some people in the server that crashes to you for no reason, and you're flying in to the air and you are getting truck damage 100%, but there is some in the server that do those things, many players are friendly, also this game has much interesting dlc's, i live in the Lithuania so it be fantastic to buy Beyond The Baltic Sea dlc. About graphics: Graphics are really good for a 2012 game, also the developers are updating this game which is really great and the game will be much better and much better.

So this was my thoughts on Euro Truck Simulator 2 

Peace!"

4213,"This has to be the best, creative and funniest game ever made. I started playing this game for the first time yesterday (02.07.2022). It's already my favourite game now and I will be grinding this game the next decades. The PvP modes are the best and it is really fun to drive cargo/trailers around EU with your friends. 10/10 highly recommended. Get it before the summer sale ends (in 7 days)."

4265,"If you are fan of simulation games, this game is for you. I can say environment art and design are not bad, but not good enough imo. Cities are just few roads. Player base is small because of that. It was cheap everyone got that, but right now, I don't think it will sell that much. Overpriced for turkey at least. That's why I don't recommend if you are not a fan for simulation."

4367,"Listen, you drive a truck.  You follow the speed limit and wait for stop lights.  Sometimes you have a detour, sometimes there is traffic, sometimes it rains.  This is a game that is very basic up front, and once you have a couple of large garages filled with employees, you'll struggle to find something to do.  Thankfully, that should take at least 50 hours, at which point I think it's fair to say you got your money's worth.

On the plus side, there is a free mod called ProMods that adds A TON of new places and roads, among other things.  So it's nice to have that, but again, once you do a couple of 3,000km trips, you'll probably be wondering what exactly you're doing.

That said, I do enjoy it even if I might only play 30 minutes at a time now.  Just when you want to chill for a bit before getting back into something engaging, whether that is another game or going outside."

The game can also be really relaxing despite needing to focus on traffic/surrounding vehicles. Wide variety of cool DLCs for an even bigger and better experience too as well as cool paint jobs."

4477,"[h1]I have lots of fun, cruising and doing jobs.[/h1]
The quality is very high, with just a few flaws here and there.
(+ = positive, - = negative)

+ great graphics, both beautiful and precise. supporting 4k
+ truck handling feels realistic
+ all major european trucks, plus adding new models for free
+ good customization options
+ steam controller support, powerful tool to have lots of control
+ the multi player community is fun and mostly friendly, but most of them race at top speed like crazy on their jobs, which is annoying. actually driving convoys is not fun like this
+ support for double trailers in corresponding regions (but only recognizing the start and end point, not the route. you can drive through regions there double trailers aren't allowed)
+ well compressed large world with lots of regional details. the length of the jobs is satisfying. the space is shortened and time accelerated outside of cities.
(my region is pretty close to the real thing, just the cities are generic)
if you tried the base game and enjoyed it, i recommend to invest in map dlcs, it adds lots of new high quality playground
+ regular updates, meaningful improvements, taking care of the community
+ sometimes cool events, like providing material for a new bridge and then have it build after reaching the necessary amount of goods or transporting christmas presents or vaccines
+ fair pricing, also for the dlcs. you have the chance to support the ongoing development, but it's not to pricy

- the default settings are not good, you have to put in work and learning time to get things right, but after you did it's working well.
- your custom steam controller setups, which you need to build to have good control, can break with updates, you have to do it all over again and this is a lot of work
- not enough info. about your truck and trips for instance. things like weight of a build is hard to find out
there are often no explanations about the technical details and terms of the trucking world and how the game works
- the AI traffic is okay, most of the time pretty clever, but too often indifferent unnatural reckless decisions resulting in accidents and other bothersome problems. they give way when they shouldn't and don't when they should. on top of that, the game always blames you for accidents. more demanding situations can't be solved by the AI. the AI's physics are too simple, driving on rails
- surprisingly the english satnav voices are very low quality, the rest is good.
- the satnav is often too late and unprecise, but routing is good
- the compressed world leads to several problems. 
sleeping times are scheduled too tight, 2 hours left is already complicated, hard to find a sleeping spot on your route in that time, but some kind of jobs are on very tight schedules
the allowed speed differences are often too heavy and too fast
- zones are too rigid. you can only sleep on rigid sleeping zones, which first let you sleep on spots where you are in the way and second don't let you sleep when you are positioned well enough.
same goes for parking trailers at your destination.
- some trailer parking spots are bothersome, blocked by objects
- with double trailers it's sometimes impossible not to get stuck, cause the spaces are too tight, this is bothersome
- company grounds and cities are too generic and not very appealing, the dlc cities are way better
- the UI is not very well designed. it doesn't look good and takes too much space and is difficult to use
[i]- most parts of the accessory dlcs are dead ugly trucker taste (in my opinion lol) but you can use some[/i]
- the finances are not well balanced. at the start your budget is pretty tight, but after you start your company, you end up having overflooding hundreds of millions. ideally i would like to have a motivating (but not frustrating) financial side later in the game too and fun things to do with your money, invest and manage your company.
- you can't see your company drivers on the road and can't do much with them
- there's no truck storage space, for the trucks you want to use privately, you have to use garage space
- there should be more animations of truck unloading, refueling, ferry trips, speeding, police checks and the likes
- the construction work is pretty nice, but the accidents on the road are pretty unrealistic.
- i don't know much about truck transmissions, but with automatic transmission, even with 100 tons of load, it uses only 6 gears of the 12 or 16 you could have.
- the simulation of air brakes is a major nuisance, cause if you are trailer parking for instance, you are 80% out of air pressure, but you can switch it off. i don't know about the realism of that or ways to solve that in reality
- when loading heavy weights, axle load is ignored. 
- a saveable setup would be nice to tackle different loads with a suitable setup, without having to rebuild every detail again.

alltogether, it's bothersome at some points, but i'm enjoying it a lot most of the time"

4484,"I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

4490,just a great realistic game
4491,"VR! VR! VR!  Yes, it's ""not supported"", but still very good.  With a steering wheel and pedals I would highly recommend it.  Even without VR it is still a great game.

Purchased in 2013 and played it for 100+ hours with only a couple DLC, great with multi-monitor and head tracking.   Over the years, I have kept purchasing DLCs hoping to get back to playing the game, but just did not get around to it.  2022 and finally got a quest 2 VR headset, all I can say is that playing this in VR puts head tracking to shame and it was great with head tracking!

If you have VR, I would say this is a must have and I hope that SCS continues to support VR and maybe even put a little more effort into it in the future, really just needs some UI tweaks to make it a bit better."

Although for the purpose of this review perhaps I should make it clear that you only get amazing with the right gaming rig. It has to be top notch."

4601,"Very good game! It's fun to drive around either alone or friends, explore new places and try to not crash. It's also very realistic, at least in my home city. The fact that it's still being updated with better quality stuff than ever, even thought it came out a long time ago is also amazing!"

4609,boring game
4610,best
4611,Great open world
4612,Very fun game to play with friends. Also a real good dedication game and there's so much to the map (with all DLC's and mods). There's also a large selection of mods that I really like.
4613,"[list] 
[*] The audio is awful and weirdly broken. For example, when the truck shifts the audio seemly just cuts out entirely, which just immediately ruins any immersion.  
[*] The graphics are pretty bad by today's standards.  
[*] The UI is a hot mess.
[/list]

Idk if American Truck Sim is any better, but I wish I had refunded this when I had the chance.  Some say mods fix the issues, but I personally found the modding community for this game to be a headache to navigate."

4633,ETS 2 is a quality trucking simulator and is very addicting. It can be a time sink at times however I like how it's beginner friendly and the customization options are vast. If you like simulators with a realistic feel this is for you.
4634,I spent over 100 hours playing this game and I still don't know why

4680,"All jokes aside, this is an incredible game. All you fellow Americans might be wondering, is it hard to drive truck in Europe if I've never been outside the States? No, my friend, this game will slowly acclimate you to the roadways of Europe. The routes are fairly simple at first and as you level up you'll get more and more complicated ones with cargo that's more valuable and possibly more fragile/dangerous to haul. 

This game is perfect for people who like chilling out to a video game or are looking to have at least one game that's chill for listening to music to, putting on a podcast, or whatever. It's fucking great. Yeah, you can do a lot of silly things too as you'll read from other review comments, but if you take this game seriously you'll also get something from it. Difficulty scales in a few different ways:

Complexity  of the route - How far, where to, how remote, night or day, weather, etc. This will go up as you level up.
Load - What you're carrying might be fragile or dangerous. As you level up, you'll be have the option to haul dangerous and destructible loads that worth more for successfully transporting to the finish line.
Realism - You can choose the level of realism you want in your driving experience ranging from automatic transmission that's simple and has an almost arcade-game feel to it or you could get yourself a wheel, pedals, and an H-shifter and drive like it like the real thing. There's options in between these two extremes, of course, but it's neat that they included that.

You can customize almost everything in this game: cab, trailer, garage; once you've got one of each you can start expanding your logistics empire to cover the entirety of Europe if you've got the business sense for it. 

And maybe you just wanna drive without worrying about being the next Logan Roy of trucking, ok, there's an option to pick up routes for other companies on a freelance-style arrangement where they supply the truck and you drive the thing from point A to B."
4681,"Great game for winding down :) Invested in SV 750 Steering Wheel from Argos, makes a huge difference :)"
4682,"Great Game to Play After Work. 
Mods makes this game even better, especially Truck Sound Mods and Graphics Mods."
4683,Absolutely brilliant! Lots of jobs and a great simulator.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After a measly 64 hours playing Euro Truck Simulator, I can safely say that this game has changed my life, and has inspired me to achieve more and strive to reach greater heights. After my wife left me in 2020 with my two children and most of my money, I was consumed in a downward spiral of depression, and there were many moments I contemplated ending it all to escape the miserable rut that became my life. However, I persevered, and my suffering finally payed off when I downloaded Euro Truck Simulator. There isn't a game that even comes close to reaching Euro Truck Simulator in terms of quality, most likely because Euro Truck Simulator has transcended the definition of 'game' entirely. Euro Truck Simulator is more of an enlightening journey, and as I travelled across the roads of Russia (Shout out to Putin) , my life took on a new meaning. At last, I had the courage to tell my boss I was quitting my day job to pursue a life on the roads. I don't have a driver's license, nor do I live in East Europe, but Euro Truck Simulator has opened my eyes to a new path for my life to take, and I intend to follow it. My only regret since starting Euro Truck Simulator is not getting it sooner, and I urge everyone reading this to get Euro Truck Simulator as soon as possible and also to donate money to me so I can move to Romania and open my trucking business."

4705,"this is a cry for help

4706,Very good game. I recomend getting it. If you like it much like it me I recomende getting teh DLC's. When there is steam sale get the bundle with evertything (except Iberia). It will be worth it.
4707,"Fun and relaxing game, it can arguably be quite a nice training simulator as well. Alltho this should not in any way replace actual driving lessons...."
4708,nice
4709,The best trucking sim to ever exist.
4710,"very realistic, TONES off truck upgrades, loads of trucks to choose from, never gets boring. recommend getting a steering wheel for very realistic game-play!! 9/10"

4714,AHUJIENAS GRAJUS ::)
4715,"Apart from the very simple mechanics of this game (drive and earn money), it's great for relaxing. Just put on your favourite radio station or music on the game radio and start driving. 

I recommend increasing the ""rain chance"" to 50%. This further enhances the relaxing atmosphere."
4716,very gud
4717,Such a nice game and community
4718,Most realistic driving simulator.
4719,vERY FUN GAME
4720,"best game for those who love, europe view, and truck"
4721,good game
4722,like
4723,"Besides American Truck Simulator, in my opinion Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the second best Simulator that i have ever played in my life. Great games"
4724,"I am a retired long haul truck driver and trucking company owner. At first, I thought that ""playing a trucking game"" in my retirement would be silly, but I was wrong. It is a great game. I am totally amazed by the realism and the perfect logic of the game. But I must admit that I have a super computer with a super graphics card and so I run the game at Ultra graphics settings. I also have a top of the line Thrustmaster wheel and pedals set. But even on a basic computer, this is a great game because the developers did an amazingly great job. Plus it is not just a 'driving' simulation, you need to manage your trucking business so it is a management game too. The pleasure of driving through Europe's fascinating cities or America's vast expanses is only one of three major pleasures of the game. Secondly, it is the challenge of driving a big rig with a triple lowboy around tight spots and up winding mountain roads, not to mention tricky pick up and delivery yards! Thirdly, the management side is much fun too. I play both Euro Truck Simulator and American Truck Simulator. Yes, I definitely recommend it."
4725,10/10 Super fun!
4726,i learned how to drive when i was -10 i dont know how to drive a druck i mean truck
4727,You drive around. And if you hit a car so be it.

4813,I've had 30 hours of playtime and i would say you need a couple addons to make it fun it doesn't have an accurate representation of citys i would recommend it if you have the money for the addons much better with a steering wheel
4814,"sure do love driving a few meters before being slingshot... rather fast into the stratosphere. 

great game."
4815,"This is awesome simulator game
I am playing more than 10 years"

*buy the game and invest 1000s of hours*
11/10"
4818,Good game
4819,"I play eurobeats when I'm driving eurotrucks
and with that much highways, 
It became Wangan: Midnight Trucks - Cummins Tune 

DEJA VU.

Amazon prime get ready for my resume."
4820,"Best simulator game I've played, the amount of fun this game has is beyond the world and there's thousand of mod you can download and make the game even more enjoyable. If you're looking for a game to kill your time this is the absolute game to go."
4821,now i understand why they told me to put my phone off while driving
4822,"One of the better ""chore core"" games out there. Easy to zone out, and drive 3000km's across Europe while listening to a podcast in the background. The huge modding community also adds countless amazing add-ons that enhance game play and the audio/visuals of the game. Great to play with a wheel and a button box. Heres hoping for 10 more years of content."

4855,"good game, ETS 2 is better than ATS"
4856,"I like this game alot, to be honest i thought this game would be boring after a day. But i played around 50 hours within less then a week. I think this game is very relaxing and a way to just be by yourself but driving trucks. I'd 100% recommend buying this game if you're unsure of buying it. For me it would be a game for just relaxing and being myself or if you actually enjoy trucking. The graphics and quality is insane and the truck look super realistic. There's nothing i really dislike about this game to be completely honest 10/10 game."
4857,"very good
"
4858,Love This Gameüòç
4859,good
4860,"great game worth the money!!!!!!!
"
4861,"I was going 80 kilometres right before I had to do an 80 degree turn so I quickly slammed the brakes and veered sharply to the right and ended up missing it and hitting a divider instead so I had to back up on a highway and I ended up freeing myself from the clutches (pun intended) of the divider but I ended up jackknifing the entire truck and I flipped onto my side and at this point there were now 3 people behind me (this is in multiplayer) and I hit one of the guys behind me and he fell on his side and I couldn't get free from being on my side so I had to call an emergency tow truck.

10/10 one of the best games I've played in 2022"

4889,"Many players have said it before, I don't have anything new to add. It is peaceful to play, can run on variety of hardware and kill time like nobody's business. On top of that, the community and SCS keep it updating so often, there is always something new no matter how long I have played it before."
4890,"This is an ideal half-game. Perfect for having something to do with your hands while watching a show, series or a stream. Gameplay is simple, straightforward, and rewarding. 

There is no early game, there's no endgame, there's just driving.  And what driving it is. ETS2 manages to capture both landscapes and cities in a beautiful and very recognizable way. Once you have employees, go out for the views and enjoy the driving.

Any full game, whould have a transition from driving your truck to managing your trucking imperium. But alas, this is a half-game. But it's very good at what it does."
4891,"Its honestly a great game, i thought a simulator game would be boring and i wouldn't like it much, but they really nailed it with this truck game thats for sure. get the game when its on a sale for a like a couple quid really cheap and good game i would reccomend"
4892,yah

4907,we goin truckin'
4908,"if u like trucks, and u like drivin'. u will like this game"
4909,"Just really relaxing, long drives are fun and the graphics are beautiful. Add some mods to it and you will have more fun with it. The more the game gets updated the more and more immersive the world gets, there is a lot of support from SCS to make this better with every update. Also, I highly recommend getting some map DLC, nothing is the same, it's all different, and it makes exploring Europe even more fun.

Overall give this a game a go, this is definitely a 10/10."

4932,"Im not really into this type of game but from my time playing it with others it really wasn't bad at all. It was fun. =)
But the only reason why I would not recommend this game is that when I and some friends start the game our mouse would somehow get stuck for whatever reason and we had to restart our pc. And then there was that time I did a job with a friend and for whatever reason I was never able to finish it. Some randoms who joined our session tried to help since they were more experienced in the game but even they had no idea as to why I could never finish the job. Good game with friends if you role play but all of those bugs I've encountered pretty much just made me uninstall the game. If you get this game just be very aware of the bugs I've encountered."
4933,"vere good and the game is rilly smove

4939,Many hours of enjoyable driving. Fully recommend this game if you're looking for a few hours of relaxing game play.....

4960,"The game play is awesome. From a US trucker with 17 years of experience, I've been every where in the ""lower 48"" of the US. Was looking for something different. Found it with this game. However I'm tired of seeing all this Russia stuff. You guys have gone all over Europe including East to Russia. But you skipped Ukraine. Why? Ukraine is a much better a prettier country than Russia. Not to mention they don't go around bullying other countries or invading other countries like Russia. Let's see a Ukraine expansion. Or are you guys anti Ukriane?"
4961,"Been playing ETS2 for a few years now and I got to say it's really unlike any other game I've played.
If you buy this game, please go for the full package and buy the DLC's since it makes the game a lot more fun and complete.

A huge con for me though is the modelling in the cities in countries such as the UK, the Netherlands, Germany etc.. (The countries that are by default in the game). Cities in these countries could use a lot more work and modelling.

As disappointed as I am with the cities in these countries, I am excited about the cities in the DLCs. You can clearly tell they put a lot more effort into modelling these cities because they actually look like cities, and when you drive through them it actually feels like you're in a city and not in some village with 2 truckdealers, a petrol station and a garage.

I highly recommend ETS2 and if you decide to give it a try, I suggest using a decent steering wheel for the true experience. (Maybe a shifter too)"

1. The new scenery is absolutely lovely and so well detailed that it really does look like a real place.
2. Vehicle customisation is fantastic with tons of cosmetic parts plus the usual engine upgrades etc.
3. Ability to hire extra drivers to expand your empire
4. Ability to purchase your own trailers
5. Proper multiplayer support with A.I. traffic and a neat convoy system to make meeting up and doing the same job really easy.
6. VR Support that actually works very well

5001,"it is actually a little boring after playing for a long time. I got bored of it after playing for 17 hours. But it is indeed a quite relaxing game, and you can play it while listening broadcast. I suggest you not to buy it if you are looking for a game with more game contents. However, the game itself is not bad, so I give it a thumb up anyway."
5002,Currently I'm listening to '9 to 5' by Dolly Parton while flying down a highway and transporting cargo labeled a bio-hazard by the German government
5003,Relaxing easy game with no subscriptions!!
5004,people relly need to learn how to not trasspass on my lawn also ima real american so i do not understand but the fuck i cannot drive 250 kms without getting a speed ticket like GET ON MY LAWN

5012,"among us simulator 2 is the second instalment in the among us simulator simulator, it provides many more features than the original among us simulator and in-turn provides a better gameplay experience, overall among us simulator reminds me of my dog , he is a bit sussy when he humps my chair leg. 

Thank you for reading this dumpster-fire."

"
5019,"This game is really fun to play single player and on convoy, I would recommend new players to also install TruckersMP (TMP), It turns the game into a server so you can play with other people online. I have been playing the game for 230 Hours nearly now and I have enjoyed every second of it, weather it is with my friends, In TMP events or just my byself, I would 100% recommend this game to everyone, I got the game when it was on a ¬£3.50 sale and I got all of the map extensions on exterior websites that give the DLC's for a cheaper price. ProMods is even better although you need all map extensions except for Iberia to get it, It ads in more places such as Ireland and it also adds in new cities and more detail to current cities. Keep up and amazing work SCS, I am looking forward to ""Heart of Russia""!!"

Tried playing it again but i just don't have the patience for it anymore."

5096,"vary nice game
"
5097,good games period the mods a lil ass cant find none but a good game nevertheless
5098,"Fun with friends. Relaxing if you know how to drive and have a wheel, but if you don't know/have either it's such a funny-chaotic experience. Don't expect much more than what the title insinuates."
5099,nice game
5100,At this stage I am just enjoying the game.
5101,Great Game (y)
5102,"For starters, the game is pretty bland but once I installed the weightless traffic mod, my world has changed around. With every vehicle I crashed, it gave me a sense of joy and I once crashed a truck off a cliff smiling as I know his family will never see him again"
5103,"With or without addition of mods, this game is really spectacular at simulating driving experience. The steering can be quite tough if you don't have a steering wheel set but mouse works fine. 

The take away is that the A.I traffic does not simulate IRL traffic. Still, it can be improve with mods though."

5285,"The game is designed superbly. Everything looks top notch. If you're driving in the dark and flash your lights to warn the incoming traffic on roads without middle separation, they will flash back, as you'd expect from people who respect road etiquette. You also have to rest, so if you go on for too long, you'll get a fine. Every eight or nine hours of driving, you actually have to pull into a rest area and take a nap. There's rain, there's fog. Worth your money."

I personally have experience driving big rigs, heavy equipment, pulling, backing, loading trailers of all sorts and more.  This game captures a lot of that real world life and implements it very well. 

If you want to really immerse yourself in the most realistic aspect of ETS2 just go into the settings and be ready to see how much you can enable in your truck to truly grasp what a REAL LIFE trucker goes through in cab and while on the road. 

The keybinding in this game rival that of Squad and Escape From Tarkov, as in there are a lot of them and tons of options. I was happily surprised when I first saw this. It told me that the developers are not messing around here and cared to make this as real as possible for the driver who wants to get as close to the real thing as they can.

The in-game environment is very visceral and plants the player firmly in a reality of actually being in a real world situation, you can hear birds chirping, the weather and lighting, time of day, sounds from people, industry, trains and so on are all great. 

C'mon, you get real lighting, thunder and the sounds that go along with a big strike as it lights up the sky at night while the rain is rapping at the cab of your rig and windshield. 

I play this game at 2K and the graphics are anything but ""trash"" as you may have read in the ignorant reviews here. I have everything maxed and I love how they chose to make this game look. Nothing else to say here. Proof is in the pudding!

Customization of your truck is endless, yes, you are awarded more and more as you gain XP and can also buy more customization options in DLC form but you are not beholden just to how those look, you can tweak those designs to the moon and back and make them something totally different. So basically the mind is the only things stopping anyone from doing what they want with these provided designs for customizing your rig. 

Then you can start your own fleet, manage multiple garages and all that goes along with that in this game as well. Or, just work for yourself, whatever you chose, I bet you will enjoy yourself. The online/convoy mode is another part of the game this is a hoot and brings something fresh into the game if you want to switch is up, it's a blast! Getting on the CB and chatting with your fellow drivers. 

This is not a gripe, but really, the only thing about a trucker they missed here is the securing of a load, the pre-trip-check/walk around for a drive, packing/stowing tarps and the other the various other aspects of the life a trucker takes care of on the daily while out for a delivery or for the long haul. That all said, I LOVE this game .. so to all of you i say grab a gear, hammer down and make the roads all yours."
5335,This game is really enjoyable and a stress-relieving game. One of the best simulator games for me along with the vast DLC (although you probably need to purchase all the DLC within discount so you won't burn ur hardworking money) and also the community (i'm not even kidding) :-)

It can be fun, driving your speedy, Swedish, Scania through the winding roads of the Baltics, overtaking every car. It can also be chaotic if said friends are idiots that cannot drive.

"
5417,"its a great game very realistic and fun ,about 99% tho .sometimes these things will happen; if your half way out of a lane a car will crash into you  car crash into you at roundabouts .speeds change down to 50 and then without time to slow there is a fine, if the trailer is still moving across the traffic lights line a fine is issued, pilots dont get far enough infront,vehicled dont get off the road very far enough, pilots stop on upward onramps as the rear pilot(who was just there) makes wait to catch up .pilot will stop and not get out of exit lane if you are too close when its doing it 200m before an exit. no penalty for cutting into a police road block .too many police road blocks . speed zone on maps could be bigger /or flash up speed changes, but these are sometimes and of very little worry just an annouance when not expected, im level 25 now with 5 trucks and 4 drivers had to register my steam so i can buy more garages and expand my driver network,  its been a good distraction from my issues of the day, .tanks ships forza and trucks what can i say ,i like to drive, if there way an update to drive around perth/western australia, some mines would be my other hope, now for some truck buyiin Thankyou 5 a great game, gday from W.A."

Not a truck enthusiast.  Never driven one or ridden in one.  However, I love this game.  Driving around miniature versions of Europe and the United Kingdom making deliveries, levelling skills, earning money to buy my own vehicle and start my own company.  This is becoming an addiction.

5480,Makes me sleepy like driving a real truck :D
5481,"Absolutely love this game - I mean, what's not to love? Nothing like a long drive with your favourite tunes cracked up."
5482,"You start as a low-skilled, truckless lorry jockey, forced to take work from established haulage companies. Slowly (or rapidly if you go to a bank) you amass the funds to buy your first rig and rent your first yard. Then the fun really begins. Contract perusing, truck pimping, skill upgrading, driver hiring... this is Eddie Stobart: The Game in all but name.

Spending 90 minutes ferrying a tank of propane from Sheffield to Prague could (should?) be tedious. The fact that it isn't is largely down to good-if-not-quite-OMSI-standard physics, and varied road layouts and scenery. Periods of smooth, almost soporific motorway motoring nestle between passages of edgier wheelwork. One minute you're cruising along contemplating the sunset over the central reservation, the next you're on a rain-lashed country road at night, waiting for the right moment to pass a painfully slow pantechnicon. Tiredness can't kill in ETS2, but it can leave you jack-knifed in a ditch, feeling awful with a substantial repair bill to pay.

The only time when the game itself loses concentration is when attempting to evoke certain regions and sounds. The further you get from central Europe the less convincing the landscapes become. No one seems to have told SCS's countryside crafters that rural Britain features long green things called hedges. Cities are often depicted with the shortest of visual shorthand ‚Äì a few warehouses, the odd landmark if you're lucky. Don't expect to see a favourite local roundabout, slip-road, or speed camera in this highly-recommended HGV-driver RPG. 
From me the gameplay is 10/10 
Graphics 10/10 
Physics  10/10  
DLC and Mods 10/10  
Conclusion : 10/10"

Euro truck sim is a little more challenging to me since I'm from the U.S. and have never been to Europe. If you like ATS you will like this. Also I recommend at least using a controller, makes the game exp... a lot better compared to using a keyboard."

5507,"Very few driving games offer a relaxing experience and exploration of some beautiful roads and scenery. This game does in spades. 

The gameplay is excellent and the truck physics are quite realistic. You can choose to do long journeys or short, or just drive around to your hearts content. You run a business to make sure you get steady cashflow, and at the same time can chose your locations where you want to set up garages.

Over the years this game hasnt changed much, but then again....it doesnt need to. A very relaxing drive from one end of Europe to another if you wish, hauling deliveries and making money along the way.

The interface is clean and not cluttred, you have loads of customisations for your truck and to top it off, you can add your own music on the ""radio"". 

A game that can keep you entertained for hours on end if driving is your kind of thing."

There's nothing better than going down the motorway at 90 with your articulated trailer and watching your friend crash with his cargo of Pfizer vaccines, having to watch him save a load because hes done 40% cabin damage and 10% cargo. The only other time in my life where ive experienced such joy is when I make a baby cry.

10/10 amazing game. Even now, after all these years, it still holds up well and would encourage you to play it. Oh, and also, Fuck you, ""DAF"", you'll never win against me, even with all those ferry cheeses you do! If I see you again, I swear to god, I will ram into you with my 750 Volvo Globetrotter and sabotage you till the end of time."
5517,"I've been playing this game since 2016 having over 367 hrs played.
It is a very relaxing game for casual occasions, playing it with your friends ,talking over it or playing it just to kill some time , sure. 

What I really would love to see in the future : 
- More truck models , like brand new trucks ( like the new Mercedes Actros 2021 model)
- Include police in multiplayer ( Get a speed ticket , your driver licence suspended for different reasons such as ramming into someone ) 
-It would be nice if there was an RP server for ETS ( Some could be police , some usual drivers, the police pulling you over asking for documents or interacting with you in general. .. i think Roleplaying would be something nice in multiplayer 

Im just asking for a bigger dose of reality/simulation type , not just driving a truck from point A to B .:)

5587,"Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a very nice game.

Starting with graphics that were good at the time, it looks very photorealistic today.

The game offers a remarkable variety of tractors, whether Iveco or Scania, every type of person gets their money's worth here.

There are many different types of trailers, from a small container trailer to the giant of the road: the triple trailer!

tuning options
The standard game already offers a tasty variety of tuning options, be it MAN (the new TGX is also coming!) or Volvo, but you can expand the brands Volvo, Scania, Mercedes and Daf with optional 'tuning DLCs'.

Half Atlas
The game features a large road network, do you want to drive in warm Turkey today and a week later hit the adventurous roads of southern Finland?
No problem!

Overall the game is a very enjoyable game, you don't need to own a steering wheel, there are mouse controls.

However, a steering wheel is highly recommended, I drive a Thrustmaster T300RS GT.

The only point I have to complain about is the articulated trains.
After so many years of standard tractors, articulated trains would be a most welcome update.

I can recommend the game, there is now an integrated multiplayer, alternatively you can choose the third party 'TruckersMP'.

I've been playing the game since 2016 CD version, since 2020 the Steam version."

5609,"So in general this game is great. It starts easy on you, no problems as long as you play in singleplayer.
But then you had to make the mistake to play this game online. With other people. People that probably never sat in a car. 
You want a heart attack? The other people in bigger citties got you! They drive like crazy. If you enter a city, there are no rules anymore. It's survival of the fittest.
You want your heart explode because of anger? The people on the highways or other streets in general got you! You drive where ever you want. You get fined for driving too fast? Don't worry, You get the Money back by ending your mission. You get fined for driving on the wrong side by accident? Don't worry, you will just be reported but still get your Money back.
But the other players have a different plan for you! They don't drive trucks, they drive bumper cars. And your Truck is their Target.
However, there ist one more enemy... Your own friends u play this game with. Because on a certain point of driving your truck throughout the emptiness of some cities, you let your guard down and that's the point where they strike, ejecting your truck into the unknown by pushing you off the road and then hitting you from a weird angle. 

So this game is funny, as long as you don't take it too serious :)"

I got really annoyed with the silly fines for headlights not being on and then being on so I was glad I went into options and found that you can turn that off. Camper Vans seem to have it in for trucks.
5641,nice game

5673,"Played this game for a about 6 hours now after playing the demo.  Yes its good.  I can chill after work and do some driving and that.  Put the headphones on and the radio and not have to listen to the misses moaning about me not washing up. 

However.....   It does need to be a bit realistic if its going to be a good sim.  Like FS22 very much realistic.  This for example.  I got fined for having my lights on during the day.  I am WTF.  Who gets fined in the UK for driving with your headlights on.  Them Volvo drivers must have deep pockets.  Also driving on the m25 in the middle of the day and no traffic.  I mean really.  The developers have never drove on the m25 before.

In review.  Good game but could be better,"
5674,"Good. Sometimes bad. Sometimes boring. But most of the times is good. And hell, how much it helps me to cope with the anxiety issues. Just putting some country music or soft jazz and driving around Europe, I get so much peace of mind."

Writing this after spending almost over 6 months of gaming, I would definitely suggest this for simulation. The graphics, the dynamics and the gameplay keeps anyone sticking to the road for long hours. 
If one have a proper simulation setup, I bet this is one of the best options to start simulation on (thought I drve casually with an Xbox controller)."

5784,Good Game.
5785,Nice
5786,"I first played Euro Truck back in 2010 even to this date i find it amazing, now with the convoy mode and AI traffic its even better. I enjoy playing this game with my cousin."
5787,"Yes, Game itself good..
Need to improve graphics more..
 But how can i create garage ???
Someone tell me ??"
5788,i have barely played this masterpiece but i already know it will be my most played game on steam

5790,love this game
5791,The most angelic sound is blasting your air horn in tunnels
5792,"ETS 2 is a game that I have been playing since my childhood. I'm still having fun playing. I can say that this game is among the most relaxing games I have played. But there are some major shortcomings in the single player part of the game:

‚Ä¢ After playing the game for a few hours, it turns into a game of just taking a task and pressing the keyboard keys, and this is what discouraged me from playing the game all the time after a while.
‚Ä¢ I don't think the money earned from missions, tow truck prices, trailer prices, bank loan rates and the like are perfectly balanced.
‚Ä¢ The fact that it only rains in the game makes me think that the weather mechanics of the game are very poor. It would be more fun and challenging if it snowed, tornadoes or other natural disasters."
5793,It is not a 100% real simulator. In Romanian DLC you cant bribe the police and I couldn't find the potholes on the streets. Not the real feeling.
5794,nice game
5795,"Amazing game and realism
"
5796,no other game will give you that ramming another vehicle on the highway which causes a major accident involving the 24 vehicles behind you making all traffic stop entirely as the road is physically blocked and you realize you also killed about 20 ppl as well and all simply because you wanted to look at the notification you just got on your phone for a second feeling
5797,i cant find special transport jobs
5798,"Game is decent,good to have some fun,best if u got with somebody to play."
5799,very good
5800,"i love it
"
5801,"Highly recommend. It's a good in single player, and multiplayer elevates this game higher, especially now with ETS2 Convoys and especially with mod support in said convoys. 

Don't have many, if any, negatives about this game."
5802,It's cool
5803,"It's a very contemplative experience to drive for 1000+ kilometers through Europe. 
A wheel and pedals are a must for this game. Some parts, such as speed cameras right after signs lowering the speed limit, slow AI drivers, and the AI slamming on the breaks into your face is annoying but manageable. Also a lot of fun to avoid red lights by going the wrong way down the parallell road! 

Overall an 8.5/10: Good atmosphere, relaxing, fun to see your company grow, dumb as bricks AI. A bit of polish or some mods and this would be a 10/10."

5840,"Unrealistic handling and very poor sounds. Graphics are outdated but looks OK with some mods. Although not fun to drive because of handling, and not immersive because of very poor sounds (even with mods). Also roads are a bit short and world not enough detailed.

Even then probably the ""best"" truck sim existing as no other serious ones does"
5841,An absolute best game when it comes to driving simulation.

5844, Best game for who wanna learn the rules of driving.

5846,"Nice relaxing game no one trying to kill you. there is some DLC but, the base game is complete and fun to play. If you like the base game DLC is worth the price, especially new areas which are always well done. I actually look forward to the next coming out. World of trucks adds events very cool. If you want a relaxing sim here you go, oh you do want a good steering wheel. I have 434 hours on this and still plan on going back for more."

5860,"is good, mexican player for the win"
5861,H‚Äãoly shit i love trucking
5862,"Groovy beats. Idyllic european countryside. High-powered machines. Slightly... less high-powered machines (not naming names, Hino base model :}) 

Good fun. Lots of freeways. As the old German proverb goes... All roads lead to Ausfart!"
5863,"best

5864,
5865,Absolutely fantastic game. Most of Western Europe is in the base game. Buy the DLC's on sale and you have an unbelievable amount of area to cover. Been playing since 2014 and still coming back.
5866,i love driving my truck
5867,We can all agree that this game is among the best ones ever made.
5868,"SCS keeps supporting this game and it simply become really polished. Map expansions keep becoming better and we are consistently getting new trucks. If you have a wheel it can keep you entertained for many hours. 
"
5869,good truck
5870,"it is a nice game, but I miss the physics when my truck hit other cars or wall like beam NG. I know it is not the objective of the game, but I think it would be nice to have."
5871,"Completely recommended for relaxing, the support of developers is amazing, still delivering new content after 10 years, I thought nobody played this game in 2022 and I discovered a very alive community and support from the devs"
5872,"Seems like every year I remember how fun this game was and re-install it.  I install my fav mods and have a great time.  As I'm driving I see an accident ahead so I move over and slow down.  Traffic ahead of me has slowed down as well, then all of a sudden they slam on their brakes for no reason and I have no time to stop.  I am then reminded of how infuriating the AI can be in this game and uninstall it."
5873,"The roads and scenery are well done. I am unable to speak to the accuracy of anything but as far as gameplay goes, it is a great way to explore. I am in the US and find the European trucks and trailers interesting and fun to drive."
5874,Very good
5875,very nice

5879,h
5880,i like driving truck and gaming
5881,Just one more... Time flies when transporting goods around europe.
5882,amazing
5883,"A bit boring -oh wonder who guessed you have to drive from A to B...

But it could be better.
- anti aliasing would be great
- better graphics 
- better bigger cities 
- better landscape
- more departures from highways/autobahn, so if you miss one you can drive back, like irl...
- villages between cities
The only thing u could enjoy on your long trips is the stuff you see and this is atm mediocre

Next is the AI and the ticket system
AI in the first moments drive good, they seem to look out for others.
On the autobahn they speed heavily and ignore incomming traffic on the autobahn.
Ones they switched lane directly from left to right in me, causing an accident and I had to pay...
DLC: Special Cargo with safty cars = Convoy wants to turn left at the intersection -> AI blocks the way bc they have to wait until the transport has passed -> but safty car won't go around the waiting AI so the convoy cant continue -> endless loop of stucking traffic ; If you drive of alone you failed the mission cause you left the safty cars behind
Also those safty cars brakes heavily on the autobahn if they want to switch a lane from right to left.

Ticketsystem,traffic light
AI wants to turn left, me wants that too. The intersection is green and we both go to the middle for turning left. AI waits so that traffic from the front has passed. Meanwhile the traffic light turned red and we started moving.
I got a ticket for passing a red light... although I was alread in the Intersection 

I guess the game hasnt reached the sim lvl I'm used to.

Important Mods that makes the game better and should be vanilla
- Realistic Truck Physics Mod (by Frkn64) <- !
- Realistic Vehicle Lights Mod (by Frkn64)
- Fael Environment
- Realistic Building Lights
- Sound Fixes Pack v22.01 - ETS2"

5885,"TLDR: It's honest work. 

Good calming game. I deliver goods and listen to podcasts or music. Sometimes it feels like meditation. There are a lot of mods that improve the base game so make sure to check out Steam Workshop. I have hired some drivers and focusing on their education. They are improving and that makes me happy. I buy trucks, upgrade them and give them to my employees. I drive my Iveco Hi-Way and eat pizza."
5886,good
5887,"this is a very relaxing and fun game, more fun on truckersmp (multiplayer) but can also be enjoyed in single player. nonetheless the reason i find it relaxing is because you can just sit back and relax while you drivel, i always loved trucking but this game encouraged it especially. the reason i find it fun is simply because there can be some traffic jams on multiplayer which i always find a very nice thing to stumble upon. yes i like traffic jams even in big trucks."

5948,"i am at the point where, watching everyone drive volvo and scania is making me hate to drive them, own them, like i cannot accept the fact there are only 2 trucks that can do stuff well, and any other truck is just meh, i sold the volvo's that i gave to my drivers too, and when i drive a renault or iveco or man, people go dude get a scania/volvo i dont want to slow down for you, why are you using a truck that cant do stuff, etc etc....

devs if you are reading this, I feel convoy is really really good, driving together is amazing, but having only 2 trucks as a major power horse is hurting a lot of people who dont want to feel bad just because they are driving another brand truck and start hating the only 2 power trucks in the game, this cannot be avoided, and no matter how much you love the other brand truck, you are still gonna end up marrying scania or volvo just because they are good house wife

I humbly request to give the base game trucks more performance upgrades or introduce more truck brands, it has been like a decade almost I think since release, you sure must have some money laying around for a new truck license, that is can be as good as the scania and volvo."

5963,"Nice simulator, for full experience i recommend (gaming) wheel and it will be the easiest way to play (controller is also fine), i don't recommend keyboard, because speed controlling is really bad. Now big minus is all those DLCs which you have to buy if you want to open almost whole Europe. with mods added this can be a massive game, couse you can unlock 100% of Europe. I recommend this game but only when it's on sale. This game was released in 2012 and had few patches so it looks better now than 2012 version."
5964,always on the wrong side of the road. also speeding tickets
5965,"This game helped to get some ladies.As before I was a pathetic nobody who WAS NOT a ladies man (unlike now) This game is very good for driving as it helps you to get all the ladies.

5969,"Very good game, you can actually play for ~20 minutes and have some fun. No need for more hours like other games !"
5970,"If you are wanting to play a rewarding and very very relaxing game with a huge amount of detail, this is it.
Honestly has blown me away and especially wanting to get a Wheel/pedels just to play this more.

From the random road closures changing your route to the relestic nature of driving from the UK to Europe and having to change sides of the road. This is such a great game. Dev's first off I apologize for not getting into this game sooner and secondly, thank you for making such a great chilled game!"
5971,"it's cool 
"
5972,amazinggggggggggggggggg
5973,.
5974,Really nice and relaxing game.
5975,50h 3 maps extensions and a lot of world left to explore . LOVE it
5976,good game ever
5977,"A great game that defined a genre. With the community mods you will expand it in way that even SCS didn't imagined. The game works great on older hardware and it's VR compatible for the ultimate immersion. The new map DLCs and other content keeps improving a game that's nearing perfection. Don't forget about the periodic engine upgrade, like graphics, and the free licensed trucks added on a yearly basis."

6007,Very hard to use a steering wheel set with this game. Recommended only if you use only mouse and keyboard
6008,"So nice. I just sit back and relax,"
6009,"Great game the graphics are amazing
"
6010,"yes, i would but it has minor problems but u can barely ever notice them
"
6011,"The game is gonna celebrate it's 10th anniversary this year. And it's still popular and it's still growing.
The creators, the modders and the players together form the #BestCommunityEver"
6012,"This game is excellent but developers should add the whole Turkey map to the game. ""Edirne"", ""ƒ∞stanbul"" and ""Tekirdaƒü"" aren't enough for our pleasure and ""Road To The Black Sea"" DLC."

6023,cool
6024,"To be fair this title shows it's age but if like me you have the wheel and pedals already, you like big machinery in games and you can get it on special then this one's a no-brainer. Definitely worth it. Captures the feel of being out on the road even tho the time and distance scale is very compressed. I have only played offline but I hear there is a pretty active community around this one."
6025,Very relaxing and a good bit of fun when it comes to exploring europe.
6026,"This game is so amazing, also when driving and listening to a podcast. Just so good."
6027,I was playing this game since 2015 through CRACKED VERSION and i purchased it for playing Convoy with friends.... Realistic Driving..

6034,"very fun to play
"
6035,"This game holds deep good vibes something I can't really explain.. The massive beast of like-engine roaring on the streets as I go deliver cargo or heavy equipment, or the exploration with the beautiful scenery and good day/night cycle, the truck stops, your computer, the customisation, at the end of the day, this game is top 1 for anyone who likes trucking and exploring!"
6036,yes
6037,good
6038,"This has been my best purchase on Steam ever!

And then you get to mainland Europe through the ferries and suddenly everything is right (literally) again?

6185,"Went into the game expecting to grab a few hours out of it for the meagre ¬£3.79 or so I'd paid for it, to then move on and thinking nothing of it.

Boy, oh boy was I wrong about that.

It takes something that should be boring by design, monotonous even, and makes it enjoyable. It's relaxing, therapeutic, cathartic? There is something genuinely satisfying about kicking back, flipping on the radio, enjoying some music whilst taking in the scenery across a variety of European landscapes on the way to finishing your current job.

As of now, I've completed a bunch of quick jobs, built up some safety capital to take a loan and then used that loan to purchase my first truck. I'm steadily paying that off whilst exploring and completing jobs, along with upgrading my truck and customising it with the spare change in my pocket. I've only really scratched the surface at the moment and I'm yet to own multiple garages, trucks or a driver / staff network, but I'm looking forward to that down the line.

Ultimately, the game-play loop won't change much, but it doesn't need to as it does what it intends to do quite well and I'm having a good time with it.

Happy I decided to take the plunge on something I wasn't sure of, ended up really enjoying this one.

[b]Edit - I bought the map pack booster, couldn't pass on it for that price on-sale. Not made of money, so Iberia will have to wait but I'll be grabbing that soon enough as well![/b]"

It's anything but.

It takes a simple concept (deliver cargo from point A to point B) and executes it very well.

Download the demo and see if it's your cup of tea."

6223,I absolutely love this game. I pirated this game as a kid back in early high school. Enjoyed it then and stumbled across it again recently. I bought it this time and this is such a joy to play. The game is still very enjoyable despite playing on mouse steering. Not a lot of driving sims can do that. It's silly to love a game so much when you're just driving a truck for hours on end lol.
6224,very wonderful trucking game beautiful maps and really good trucks and heavy haul loads etc

6231,"Best simulator you'll find. Genuinely. Don't go in expecting some amazing exciting blood-pumping gameplay. This is a game you pick to calm down or when you simply don't know what else to play. Once you get the hang of the basics, this game will take the ,,guaranteed enjoyment'' spot in your library. If you already bought the game, but you're considering a refund, because you're not getting the enjoyment you thought you would - stop. Give it some more time, it will get better the more you play, and especially the more you explore. In this game driving isn't the main focus - the scenery and those sexy machines are what you'll be mentally jackin' off to. I recommend buying all of the dlcs, but only on sale, because they can go down by up to 80% off, and quite frequently at that. The dlcs have 10 times more detail and content than the base game, but that's a given considering the basic map came out in 2012, and the skill of the developers grew since then. I bought a steering wheel just for this game, which I'd never have thought I'd do back when I initially bought the game - that's how hooked you will be. I hit my 100th hour, playing with a steering wheel in VR (It is supported without mods). When I took of the headset I felt like I just came back home from a genuine trip across Europe. I honestly do not know what else I am supposed to add. Just buy the game and give it as many chances as you can possibly hand out. If you buy the game on sale, don't even bother refunding it, you'll be happy you didn't."
6232,the game is too good I recommend everyone to install a demo and buy the whole game because it is better than ATS enjoy euro truck simulator 2 because it is the best

American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 are both great games. I bought the games a few years back when they were on sale for $4.99. I absolutely love this game. With all the new DLC's coming out theres so much more to explore. You also have TruckersMP and Promods to make the game more fun. You can also mod the game (not compatible with TruckersMP) to make it even more beautiful or fun. There are all kinds of mods, visual, audio, AI, map, you name it!

The trucks, physics and graphics however, are amazing. It feels realistic. With mods you can make the game even better and they're super easy to install. If you need money or you're not a high enough level for a truck you like, you can either mod your level/money or you 'grind' for it."

Although this game is already 9 years old, it still has pretty nice graphics, and is pretty unique. Gameplay is very interesting and entertaining (mainly online thanks to mods and with a wheel setup), it's sometimes pretty fun with friends,, sometimes a bit raging with people crashing into people and creating a big mess, with also some glitches (you can make infinite money with a mod content bug), some bugs (the game sometimes gives you a fine because you ""passed the intersection at red light"" as it was at orange light) but nothing really annoying, except when your truck clips through texture because of accidents. Some people will bore on this game really fast, some others will not, but that's an interesting experience, with a pretty ""simulation-like"" driving experience (you have blinkers, your truck can stall, you have cruise control which is very rare in car/truck games)."

6305,"A fucking game is mining crypto on your GPU or something. Fucking no-sense usage of your GPU power even in main menu afk in alt+tab is 99%. WTF. I don't want my sole-one video card to die because of a game where there is no real high-end graphics, but it just kills your GPU for no reason. 

The game content is overall ok though

UPD: Well, it was fixed by manually turning v-sync in Nvidia Control panel. Found a ""fix"" there: (https://steamcommunity.com/app/227300/discussions/0/3094509155609467740/). 
IT probably had to deal with some unlimited FPS. An engine infinitely required the CPU to calculate as much as possible. 
Probably locking the FPS to the frequency of the monitor is recommended as well.
 
There is a problem that wasn't fixed, despite the game having 10 years of experience, and a quite a community: a shame, really. And please, don't even start on ""that's TOTALLY NORMAL"" thing as a lot of normies were telling on similar threads. Cause it's obviously not. The game doesn't need that much of a GPU power to run smoothly. That much of GPU usage lead some ""users"" to bust their GPU's much much faster. Which is not really good thing, considering the time we live in... 

In conclusion: I leave the review as negative until the game run smoothly on default settings, without any unnecessary computing, as intended. The game itself, however: is to my very liking. Hope the devs will think and fix that issue, it would be really nice."
6306,very cool
6307,fuck you qoiq
6308,"Nice game. It was a bit hard to setup and fix the VR mode, and now it's FINALLY working. VR in this one is far from perfect, but does the job quite well. On the Quest 2 stuff beyond ~10 meters away are VERY blurry, but you can drive ok. The only downpoint is performance: I have a, RTX 3070 ti, and the game STILL (since almost 1 decade ago) has lots of rubberbanding, stutter, and other performance and bug problems. DEVS, WHEN WILL YOU FIX IT ALL?! Dear lord... Since 2012 pointing this all out! Nothing gets fixed! Each passing year, more and more problems need fixing... 

I like the way trucks work, and as I have even worked in a truck factory, I can say they're quite accurate! Really cool. I just wish sounds were more close to each individual truck, and more interactions were possible. 

But sadly, to trully get the entire game, you need to buy WAY too much in DLCs... This is the sad part. I DON'T like the way they charge for pieces of the map and addons. The base game is so cheap it should be named ""base game demo"", or even get released for free (again, 10 YEARS), and then you pay for DLC if you want. That'd be nicer! 
When you're missing TOO MUCH if you don't get most DLCs, this is the problem: it's not clearly explained when you get the base game, and this makes me REALLY disappointed. New players get totally confused. 

Final veredict: 6/10 for base game, too restricted, could be a 7 if some of the new trucks, parts or addons from some of the DLCs were added for it at no cost, otherwise feels like selling the same game for almost a decade while not adding much on it. Not buying many DLCs means not getting much different from 2012. Again.. ALMOST TEN YEARS SINCE RELEASE. 

DEVs 100% need to stop wasting time with their restrictive old slow bad performing engine and start a new better game ASAP, based on a more capable mainstream engine. They know how to code! But that ain't making it easier when using new technologies. Just imagine if the game had better performance and compatibility for DLSS and RT! 
Many other games have more details, more simulation and better graphics and have BETTER PERFORMANCE. 
I really like simulation games, but I won't and shouldn't wait 10 more years for the next great better one because the devs keep waisting time with stupid tons of generic little DLCs. Time better spent making the game run better and have better graphics. It's DX11 based and still don't got 10% of the graphics settings many other games have. I'm that frustrated because I feel the potential this game has and could be an even better ETS3 instead."
6309,"Nice game to play with friends and destroy each other trucks and then to start all of it again and then be emo and go with 150 km and right away fell on the road. btw the npc are dumb sometimes they just stop in front of you and idk when they bump in you ,YOU are the one that pays the money for them crashing in you"

It is a wonderful representation of ""that road life"" and the European aspect of it really sets it apart from its American Truck Simulator counterpart. Graphics, audio, etc. are similar if not identical. Great casual gaming all around. Sales are common, so if you see it at full price then just give it a few weeks. SCS is always offering sales on Steam so just hang in there if you are interested but not sure about the full price scheme."

6441,Awesome Game
6442,very nice love it just wish graphics was like realistic but other than that its good
6443,Best business Game. I wish they could make it possible to walk out of the truck and back in. Please also do a feature for real off road roads with potholes. We don't mind the shocks we shall always buy from the garage

I'd say that the lack of variety in the weather is disappointing.  There are no changes of the seasons.  But that is a small gripe.
All in all I would recommend this game to anyone who likes driving simulators."

2. need better engine sounds varying upon different rev ranges.
3. traffic, trains need be more varying and versatile, more buses on the roads."

6700,"One of my favorite games to just relax in. Just connect your steering wheel, put on your favorite spotify playlist, sit back and enjoy the ride. The most special thing about this game for me is the possibility to visit almost every European country, especially the parts almost never presented in video games otherwise, such as my home country Sweden and the rest of the north. Central Europe is also never explored except for in WW2 and medieval games. Can't wait for the map to cover the entirety of Europe (hoping for Ireland, Iceland, rest of Balkan)."
6701,Si eres aficionado a la conduccion este juego es un vivo ejemplo de un buen juego de Simulador de troces. Muy recomendado y creeme no te vas a arrepentir.

6733,"Overall good game, more trucks are necessary in my opinion, but they are good as they are, they need to have more complex cities, because with the current design, well... driving through huge or even capital cities seems to be boring af. Plenty of work ahead, if they want to continuously  update the game instead releasing a new, better one. They REALLY should HIRE the team of PROMODS, so they can work together or something."

6742,It is a very great and detailed game with alot of features and also very cheap addons. 10/10 would reccomend.
6743,the best game i played ever!
6744,trucc go vroom vroom
6745,"This game is awesome! Graphics are so gooood.  Physics are also good! The only thing that i don't like is that the price of each tour is very big and when you have a lot of trucks you earn like 200.000‚Ç¨ - 300.000‚Ç¨ or more per night. And it's a little bit anoying beacuse you can take a sleep, and when you wake up you can already buy a new truck. 
But othervise the game is amazing like i said!!!"
6746,Este conceput pentru a fi jucat corect doar cu un setup adecvat si anume un monitor imens cu volan si pedale dupa care realizezi ca progresul in joc este complet degeaba!
6747,good

6769,This a good game I just don't like that the DLC for the game ( Which literally is necessary or else the game is not that good ) is priced at like a billion dollars for just a little map part in the game like I can get a whole new game for that price better yet buy ETS more than once just for a DLC this is honestly just stupid and I really think that the pricing should be changed

6801,Really good game works on low end computers too mine is a low end computer it lags sometimes within the first I would say 5-10 minutes but after that Nothing wrong with it 10/10 would recommend
6802,"good
"
6803,"A very good simulation game, I would like to have a steering wheel for more experience in driving. I would have liked a little more of famous site seeings while in cities. Other than that the game is really cool, I recommend to all who like or not simulation games, plus I hope that some time will expand transports in the other continents :)"

6818,"Its a great game love the scenery and the realism of the driving, it could have more real places like my country Gibraltar that is not added, a great pity as this would be a great challenge for the drivers, also i would say Real weather could be a great improvement, also i do not like the fact that when i buy my livery and i change it i have to buy it again, same happens with the trailer."
6819,Stefi Petkovic vezba kvacilo
6820,"Been playing ETS2 since 2012, I'll break it down into simple pro's, con's & wishes.

Pro's:
- Immense map (though the best bits are DLC related maps)
- The map gets updates; both in terms of new locations and old locations receiving updates
- Detailed trucks & trailers
- Fantastic customization (though some of it locked behind DLC)
- Being able to copy a configuration so expanding your fleet with the same trucks becomes easier
- Recently added *official* multiplayer mode
- The game is so relaxing
- DLC is very affordable and includes new countries, cargo, customization, liveries ...

Con's:
- Some might say there's too much DLC in this game (76 items at the time of this review)
- As your company grows, buying new trucks & drivers becomes a chore; would be nice to simply buy 5 trucks at once and auto-hire a driver for em.
- The multiplayer mode; as great as it is, lacks social features. As well as reporting-features; or ignore lists. Sadly toxicity and griefers also can make their way into ETS2
- Sometimes, traffic feels weird, no traffic jams ever, unless the Ai messes up unto itself.

Wishes:
- More licensed trailers for more industries (Nooteboom, Schmitz ... MORE)
- Visual update on older truck models
- New Lights & Beacons (dlc?)
- A slide-bar that allows us to change traffic density
- Dirty trucks / Flat tires / Oil changes etc. Extra maintanance for realism
- Being able to design our own trailer-livery with an in-game editor. Not everyone likes mods. Adding 'company information' on trucks would fit as well. 
- Allowing for owned trailers to be passed around automatically between garages, so you just buy trailers for the whole company, not 1 specific location."
6821,Great experience!
6822,pppro cok iyi
6823,the speed limit is always multiplied by the number of axles you have

6829,Just like it
6830,"The game allowed me to take a break from the daily grind and see what it's like running a trucking business in Europe. Majority of the base game is in Germany, France, Netherlands, UK, Czech Republic, etc. Looking forward to new and fun DLC content which contain new maps. Fun and enjoyable and I was also able to create my own sound playlist as well while making the deliverables."

6852,I GOT STUCK IN A WALL AND GOT LOTS OF DAMAGE THIS GAME IS TRASHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6853,"This game is the first simulator I have played in my life.

The hours of driving, while relaxing and listening to music is really what soothes the mind.
Also, the different views you get while driving makes the driving never boring (especially mountain areas)
Along with these benefits I have also learned a lot from this game about trucks.
I would definitely recommend this game to everyone to at least play it for a couple of hours, you'll have an unique experience!
This is the game which you should play if you are in need of relaxation, truly!

Normally I download DLC's when I become bored, but for this game I bought the DLC's because I was curious to discover all the new cities.

My recommendations to the developers:
- Please make the use of gas more realistic: when I'm not accelerating, the radius decreases as well.
- You could ad bikes as well.
- Maybe some missions where you have to do deliveries to special/restricted areas would be fun as well such as military bases and the airport
- Also if there is an opportunity make the driver see more of the city. If I'm in Paris for instance, it would have been lovely to see at least some more famous French structures.
- Please make Netherlands more realistic (I'm a Dutchman)"
6854,"When I first bought this game, boy did I love it, I mean really love playing it. I grew up around trucks, what with my father owning a haulage company. So it was a delight to see a Volvo F10 in the workshop and actually be able to drive one of the trucks my old man owned. That really appealed to me, so much so I taught myself how to mod a trailer, make a skin for the truck. Then life got in the way, my father got ill and I wasn't able to play ETS2 for over 18 months. I came back a few months ago, hoping to play it and take the old truck out on the road. But ETS2 had other idea's, Steam forced me to update my install, even though I didn't want to (Would have been nice to have the option). The update completely messed up my install and made all my mods, custom skins incompatible. Basically it broke a previously perfectly working game. Way to go SCS Software! Truly, bravo! There should be an option to opt out of updates, because you know what your update did? It put me off buying anything more from SCS software. I'm done constantly having to wonder if the next time I play the game, you'll have broke something else I like.

So long as you don't use any mods, alter your game in anyway, you'll probably have a great time playing ETS2. IMHO SCS should remove the mod feature from the game as it leads one to think ETS2 is a mod friendly game.

6939,"I've played this game since very close to release and I've also played most of the older trucking games that SCS has made. To me this game is the equivalent of comfort food.

Yes, it's nice for killing time, it's also nice for something to do while you're listening to a podcast or chatting with a friend. Sometimes though, you just have to step back and admire the work and soul that's been poured into this. The attention to little details, the pursuit of making the roads and landscapes feel accurate even though the map about 1/19th of the size. Even the lighting effects as your truck passes under a street light late at night, the sounds and of course all the beautifully crafted mods made by one of the most dedicated communities out there.

I could go on for ages, but I think you should get it yourself and discover more of these trinkets on your own."

6952,I have 69 hours in this game which means it's a NICE game
6953,like this game <3
6954,k
6955,thats was fun
6956,"Very enjoyable and a fresh change from American Truck Simulator for me.  Hard to find anything I don't like about the game.  I did start with a keyboard and found it somewhat difficult as the roads and such are very tight compared to ATS, not a lot of room for error.  I love playing the game now I have a wheel for my computer!  The trucks are super highly detailed and the scenery is great!"
6957,"What it does well: 
 + Each country is well researched and the landscape looks / feels realistic. Road markings, signs and textures are realistic for each country
 + The graphics are good/great. One of my favorite things is to enjoy the landscape while making deliveries. 
 + Can be a low-stress, very relaxing game. 
 + Really the only option out there currently.

Downsides:
 - No dynamic seasons / seasonal weather - Snow would be really nice. I know there are mods, but...
 - Roads ending suddenly - It would be nice to have a larger road network, including alternate routes that would allow for avoiding tolls
 - Asset loading / unloading - the game will unload assets once you pass them - it's really weird seeing the tunnel you just passed through disappear in your rear view mirror. 
 - Asset variety - As a gearhead i would love to see a larger variety of traffic / car models in the game. 
 - Expensive: If you want access to the entire map, there are a lot of DLC's / Expansions that need to be purchased. 
 - Lag / Stutter. After playing for long periods of time I get rubber banding - The game will slow down, the suddenly speed up to 2-4x speed before returning to normal. A restart normally fixes this
  - More management options for the drivers you can hire would be nice - Assign them to longer routes or specific routes or cargoes.

Overall a good game, but there certainly is room for improvement before I would call it great. With all the DLC's available it does make sense to wait for a sale to pick it all up at once."

You can pick a selection of Trucks to drive all over the world, by yourself or with up to 7 others. And what I also like about it is that they are still doing daily updates on the game, even when it came out about 10 years ago. One of the oldest simulators, yet one of the most enjoyable and realistic ones I have ever came across. Amazing!"

7032,"What is there to say that hasn't been said about this game before? It's really fantastic. Though the physics are by no means full on racing-sim level, why would you ever need them to be? You're driving a truck along motorways and country roads, not pushing a Porsche 911 GT3 around the Norchliefe to its absolute limits. The physics are more than good enough for what this game is, and with the correct mods from the workshop can feel just as detailed as the likes of Assetto Corsa when driving normally and perhaps a little too quickly!

In addition to this, mod support is really good, with the option to keep the game at a specified version to ensure all of your mods aren't broken in an update. It's called Euro Truck Simulator but with the right mods you can drive in Indonesia, North Africa and South America - just to name a few.

If the images and videos get your interest then I cannot recommend this game enough. It is everything you have seen and quite possibly more."

7132,"Pros: 

- quite relaxing in single player and (sometimes) multiplayer
- fun to customise your truck

Cons:

- Gets repetitive and boring without multiplayer

- Multiplayer community isn't ""verbally"" toxic but rather entitled.  Expect someone to fly into you at 70Mph as you lose your hard work and watch nothing happen. Meanwhile watch you make a tiny little mistake that damages no-one and expect 1week+ bans from people with 4000+ hours in the game.  

- Have to record every single thing you do for when you get banned. (oh and by the way even if you can prove you did nothing wrong you still get banned)."

It isn't reasonable at all to not include the FreeRoam Feature from the start, like every other sound game developers of simulation games long before today. Very sad but true the developers exclude this beloved feature by the vast majority of sim - or any game - fans, not only here. Very dampening towards the love to simulator games. Probably impossible for me to get a refund now after having learning after weeks from purchase."

Was it worth it?  It depends.  Euro Truck Simulator 2 is just ""only"" a good title of this genre.  The production is very playable and enjoyable, but at the same time it disappointed me with some of its solutions - maybe I was just too demanding for it.  However, this does not change the fact that it is currently the best truck simulator available and I can honestly recommend it to every fan of ""road cruisers""."

7244,Great trucking sim. Realistic. I read one review about it being to bad you could not actually get in and out of the trucks and walk around. That would be a great addition to the game where ever there are sights in the game  and do walk arounds on your trucks and stores and companies .

7264,"I've played this game in many different ways, simulation, ""creative"", vanilla, modded. I can for sure say this game is fun no matter which way you chose to play it. If you like big trucks, GTA V style Ai driving sense, super long drives, international radio stations, cops that somehow see everything you do even if you're 5km away, flipping your truck while you figure out the correct ways to use you retarder and the engine break, driving with friends, then i suggest this game for you. 

Mods you should consider (steam workshop);

Realistic Traffic Fines, forget who the creator is but it should be the most subscribed one
Better Ai Traffic, same as above haha"
7265,"this game is incredible; at the moment i don't have the greatest pc but the game still automaticly adjusted the setting to be the best while keeping 60 fps the developers have done a great job;

7273,"Since the last update the game now refuses to start on the good old Steam client from [b]OCT 2019[/b] and requires the modern piece of trash steam library to work.
Now i have to keep a separate install of this bloatware library to play online.

The forced updates are becoming annoying too in this game, every patch it takes several minutes unpacking/updating/repacking files that it took only 10 seconds downloading."

7280,"As a 61 year old ex-UK trucker with 35 years of experience behind me, I can honestly say this fantastic game is as close as it gets to the real thing!
Great selection of tractor units and trailers and brilliant maps.  Driving physics, sounds and graphics - all better enhanced with the best mods - are spot on!

Get yourself a really good wheel and pedals (I use the G29) and you're good to go - and you don't have the stress of dreadful route planners and transport managers with sh*tty attitudes.

ETS2 has to be possibly the best driving game out there.  It's definitely the king of large vehicle driving games!

Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day.

7343,"Euro Truck is a pretty cool guy, eh shoots up motorways and doesn't afraid of anything."
7344,"This game is surprisingly fun with many roads to drive and beautiful scenery to take in, plus, the trucks are highly detailed and fun to modify and improve. The feeling of getting a new truck is always something to cherish, as you start to build your own collection, you realise you need more garage space to store the trucks and so you complete more deliveries and BAM! You can hire drivers to complete deliveries for you so you can take a break.

Pros:
Fun and doesn't seem to get old (for me it's still fun after 69 hours)
Cheap! For a small game, ¬£15 ($20) is reasonable, but it's often on sale for ¬£4 ($5)!
Many great DLCs! They are inexpensive and are great value for money.
Great Developers! They are constantly updating the game even though it's a decade old now!
Excellent controller support! Keyboard, Gamepad or Sim Wheel, they all work very well!
Mod support done well; Many great mods can easily be implemented into the game!

Cons:
Some areas are tedious to drive through, like most of England's motorways and all the ferry ports' roads.
The DLC vary in quality, and so do the trucks.
Not enough trucks (Mods can fix this).

All in all, it's a great game worth buying!

7363,"I cannot emphasize how great this game is!

This review might sound like one of those humorous over the top ones but this has honestly given me so much for what I paid for this game.

I bought it originally as a ""I'll get an hour out of it every now and then"" game, starting off with a controller. Pretty much straight away... I'm living on this thing, putting hour after hour into it.. 

I'm from the UK.. and with no disrespect to SCS... The default UK map is horrendous.. there's not much authenticity to it... But then I found the modding community... Good god I was amazed at how many mods there are for this game. As soon as I saw promods I downloaded it and within an hour on that, I had a wheel, pedals and gearstick ordered.

This game with a few mods looks immensely realistic... I just sit here for hours at a time sometimes with some earphones in... Sometimes with music and sometimes just listening to the sounds of the environment around me... 

This game has increased my obsession with trucks dramatically and exploring the promods world and seeing some of the landscape has at points Literally had my mouth wide open in amazement. 

Don't get me wrong... This game does have some annoying factors... But they're nothing compared to the positives and if anything just make it realistic. Sometimes the traffic AI make silly decisions like slowing right down on a motorway when other traffic tries to merge onto it... Causing me to either slam into them or have to indicate quickly and knock the next lanes traffic out.  sometimes they fail to give way at roundabouts and I'm blamed for it etc. But I also acknowledge this happens in real life sometimes and by no means puts me off this game. 

I'm completely obsessed and in love with it when using a steering wheel I just forget everything exists... It's just me and Silvia (my truck üòÇüòú). I love this game with a passion and can safely say I'd spend many more hours on it..

This is such a stress reliever and whenever I'm feeling down its a sure fire way of cheering me up a bit by forgetting whatever I'm down about and adding a few thousand miles onto Silvia's clock. 

I 1000% recommend this game and now after getting a new wheel after the old one broke I'm definitely going to be racking the hours up. 

Sidenote - I also have all of the DLC and it's amazing!!"

7431,Good Game
7432,Nice game to relax and chill to
7433,Honestly a very chill game to both play on your free time and stream to other people.  It doesn't force you to take the simulation seriously by making the whole driving process require a bunch of buttons or for your character to be forced to take rest stops to sleep but at the same time it gives you the ability to make it that way through it's extensive options menu. It's rare to see a simulation game that caters to both the hardcore simulation crowd and the people who just want to have a fun truck driving game experience for an afternoon. Plus both this one and the american one are still getting new areas which is pretty neat.
7434,sweet game
7435,good
7436,grate and fun relaxing truck driving game wood highly recommend it to others

Its only fun if you find it fun. Its simple. You drive a truck with cargo around europe and earn money to buy more trucks. Its quite old so the graphics are very meh, but i think there are mods for that.
!dont play without a steering wheel! Its completely unplayable without one. 
I love the VR support and i play it mostly in VR. But you need to watch a tutorial on how to switch VR mode on.
The map without DLC is a bit repetitive as everything kinda looks the same but its ok.

The map is also very huge and driving is relaxing and fun.
I'd suggest to improve the AI for other cars and how they behave to avoid collision and accident, it's not currently bad the way it is right now but I think it could be improved to make it much more realistic.
The graphics are very nice especially the driver cab and the sounds are very nice!
I bought this game when it was on sale, worth every penny!
P.S. having a steering wheel with a shifter and 3 pedals is advised for better experience (even with the keyboard it's still nice but the difference in experience is huge)."

7503,"Euro Truck Simulator 2 is one of the  best games i have played and it it very good for the price and personally i think this game should be at least ¬£8 since you can travel through the whole of Europe and experience what it is like for day to day people who drive a truck not only that it has all real driving rules and proper names of roads everything that this game has to offer is similar to real life 

Thank you"

With DLCs being reasonably priced and releasing almost every year, the longevity of the game is superb. Definitely a must for anyone looking for a relaxing driving game to play by themselves or with others"

Credit goes also to the developers still keeping the game enjoyable by adding new content and still developing and introducing new features to further improve the overall gaming experience.

Great game to relax and unwind in. Be advised, this is not the game for you if you're impatient."

7599,"I find the game to be relaxing, strange as this might sound. If you're really into trucks and trucking in general, this one's for you."
7600,"Love the game, seems boring at first glance but in reality it's addictive as hell, yet highly enjoyable."
7601,nice game
7602,"I like the fact that the team behind this game are always working on updates, bug fixes and others. There are more thing that everybody wants to be added in game, but is not as easy as is sound. It is not a perfect game, but the fact that they still working at him makes it perfect, in my opinion. There is always room for improvement if the team is still working on it. Overall a good game to spend some time in."
7603,It's fine. It most certainly is a good game so I think it deserves a thumbs up but it's just not quite right for me. The game play loop get old fast and it feels like you aren't really progressing and so things like purchasing your own truck can feel like a step backwards. I do still find it very enjoyable in moderation which would be my main advice to anyone who plays this.

7615,"If you play this alone and just want to play TruckerMP or just want to drive and listen LOCAL music on your pc I don't reccommend very not reccommend, waste your money and waste your time. Just play DEMO and fill your needs go buy another game please."
7616,"Already played 36 hours. Addictive truck simulator. Nice maps and scenery. Very good features. Radio option inside also good add-on. All in all, who likes truck driving, highly recommended. Cheers!"
7617,I like trucks
7618,"This game is addictive, but VERY annoying too, you just cant progress, every time you make any money it throws you a curveball

i almost put my fist through the screen when i went to mod my truck and it changed it to left hand drive, i didnt tell it to, thats about the final straw with this game messing me about, so i deleted my progress, and im tempted to ask for my money back, i wasted nearly 90 hours playing it for seemingly NOTHING"

7699,"Great game, graphics are most appreciated and the rain effects while driving are good.  I also enjoy the realism of the hauling of certain weights of loads.  Traffic can be annoying and it's a tiny bit hard to not just pedal to the metal everywhere since you have to beware that cars will come out in front of you and stuff while approaching red lights.  There's options to change a lot of the things in game that might not be too good at the first bit and it makes the game really playable.  If you have a USB controller you can configure it with the game to make gameplay much nice.  Lastly I didn't realize for years that this game was available on Linux and I am so amazing stoked that it is.  DLC selection is also very nice too.  Can connect to WorldOfTrucks website and there's a sister game for it called American Truck Simulator in case you don't like the european style of trucks or map.  Absolutely recommend this game to all."
7700,"SCS has done an amazing job with both Euro Truck Sim and American Truck Sim, great detailed locations, detours and road accidents, and they are still continuing to update the game and dlcs. I have been playing truck sims since Hard Truck 2 and how far they have come blows my mind"

7705,"First time I saw ETS2 I thought: Nah not my thing, good friend of mine said try it...then lockdowns kicked in, then the Winter sale put this icing on the cake! what enjoyable little game^^ truckin' about, making deliveries, getting a slapped wrist by rozzers like a noob...ahem; happily, gradually getting used to being in a cab, weight, grip and individuality of each truck, reversing into place to deliver truck and container for the full xp, right hand drive, left hand drive, making trips for UK to Europe and vise-versa...Well worth picking in the sale with all DLC included, easy to play with a controller a smidge remapping helped alot.

Update 16/01/2022: really enjoying ETS2 such a good game, throwin' on some lofi chill drive on youtube, best so far has been going from Strasbourg to Lyon with a slight puckering of the cheeks as I head down unlit country lanes with 50mph limit hauling 21tons of LPG just letting the cruise control do it's thing... odd thing is that it reminds me of/ give that nostalgia feel of Jaguar XJ220 racer on the Mega CD, Lotus Elise and Lotus Elise 2 on the Amiga/Atari ST 520....just pulling several tons of cargo, at 60mph on down hill section of a motorway speed limiter doing it best to slow me down and failing whilst trying not to flip my truck again going round a high speed corner!"

7812,"This game is a bit of a guilty pleasure to me. I had no idea that driving a truck throughout Europe could be that fun and relaxing. With your favorite playlist/podcast in the background, the hours really do fly by. The expansion DLC's are definitely worth getting as a discount. The mod support is outstanding too if you wish to tweak the game."
7813,Chill game. Not a lot to say about it to be honest. Buy only on sale for 5$
7814,"Got a small loan of 100 thousand euros, and with the help of my life savings I bought the most beautiful Volvo in the world.

7836,"The map looks the same no matter where you are. There are a few landmark buildings in some cities, but that's it. Also, when there are traffic signs indicating a speed of eg. 90mph the board computer will say 80. If there is a sign that all restrictions are cleared, no matter if you are on the Highway or not, the board computer will say 80. It's just poor for a simulation game."

VR only makes it better."

7892,Lots of great scenery. Interesting way to see much of Europe.

7897,yea
7898,good game
7899,i genually like this game could do with some minor gameplay to make the game more realist. 1) could be working in bussiness accaully loading the trailers. 2) loading docks could open when you reverse into the. 3) could accaully have a delivery form for the bussiness your delivering to. But besides the points its a really good game suggest playing it and cant wait to see if they bring out and future driving games

All-in-all, this is a great game, with negatives being little-to-none."
7960,"Don't buy it. Great game, but steer well an truly clear. It's partly steams fault but also these stupid devs. After driving trucks all week signing on to see a 12 f***ing gb update is disgusting. I don't care I don't want new s**t. Just let me play the goddam game with wasting my time updating it. Gaming got me though the toughest parts of my life but I'm so so over these f***ing updates and devs thinking they can force me to update MY, MY PROPERTY. I paid for the game, now f**k off, stop making me update it. I was happy with it in 2014, I'm less happy with your game now than I was then. I don't care about some expansion or some online crap, STOP UPDATING IT, let me choose to play it outdated at the very f**king least. All you - the devs and you - steam are, are a pack of C**ts.

The game itself involves a player slowly building up their own trucking empire, starting by using company trucks and trailers, to their own trucks, to eventually, their own trailers. The game developer as foreseen the issue on spending a literal 7 hours on the road, and as such, has a clever time skip, that simulates time quicker while driving which games gameplay enjoyable.

My main issue with this game, is the cities and the photos of them, against what is posted as well as a severe lack of detail. Picture this, you've completed a long drive starting from Paris, your destination is London. You're carrying a large crate of wood shavings (Don't ask me why) and need to get across the channel. There are two methods, either hop on a train, or hop on a ferry. No Eurotunnel to drive through; first disappointment. Next, once you finally reach your method of transportation, you're greeted with a menu. ""Fast Travel to Dover?"" Of course, you must click, am I then given a cool montage of the sailing progress or the train going through the tunnel? No, my screen fades to black, the game loads, then I appear on a new Ferry in Dover, ready to drive off and go. Following a disappointing channel crossing, I finally make it to London. I see the Gherkin form on the horizon, with the London Eye and a few other similar buildings of the London skyline. But wait, it's just in the background, a skybox. The London itself, that you can drive on, is no larger than a small Russian city on the other side of the continent. What a buzzkill huh?

Don't get me wrong, fun to drive, if tedious at times, and certainly relaxing, but more than a few things that make me go, 'seriously'? I expected a lot more from a larger developer, especially as this game was a sequel."

7974,"Turns out driving a truck through the night under light rain, while listening to local radio stations, is my dream."
7975,"This is the most ""dad"" game I've ever played.

This game makes me feel like I'm driving for the first time again: Terrified I'm going to crash into something!"
7976,"I love this game. I can't say it's objectively the best game to ever exist but I can say it's a very relaxing game that's easy to get into.

A downside is the amount of DLC you'll need to buy with the game.

An upside is the amount of mods available."

7980,"It is a lot of fun to travel the roads of the world, with a series of fascinating vehicles, even if not easy to drive, if not after having acquired some experience, with maneuvers and encumbrance.
In addition to the fun of driving, there is also the business management aspect, although making money with this game is too easy ... I don't think that, in real life, truckers can become millionaires that easily ..."

8007,"Miracles from heaven. The single best videogame experience of this century, if not of the whole mankind.

Let's talk about the graphics. They are stunning, it's an eye candy and I certainly am glad to put my gaming rig to work with this beast. The graphics are important, remember that!

The OST is fantastic, every time I play it, I get goosebumps and flashbacks to my childhood when nobody wanted to be my friend for this game.

And what about the cultural impact, you might ask? Well, governments have agreed to withdraw nuclear arms race just to be able to play some EURO TRUCK SIMULATOR 2, kids in school no longer study Fortnite skins, and they have EURO TRUCK SIMULATOR 2 to thank for that.

I love EURO TRUCK SIMULATOR 2, I play EURO TRUCK SIMULATOR 2, I breathe EURO TRUCK SIMULATOR 2, because I want to be EURO TRUCK SIMULATOR 2. Your boyfriend, your dead grandmother, and even your local game journalist can enjoy this piece of history and masterpiece. 5/5"

8022,"Did I just get scammed or did scammed just get I'd?  This game acts as living proof that Fortnite has irreversibly damaged the gaming industry, and, quite possibly, is a warning sign that humanity will cease to exist in the next 1000 years as a result of hitting a Fermi Filter.   To the devs: the game would be MUCH better if you added guns."

8024,"You might think, trucking is boring, why play a game of it? Well i have no idea BUT for some reason, for me, it is fun.

8190,"Euro truck simulator 2 (ETS2)
The ultimate truck driving simulator

ETS2 is a truck driving game, based on the older truck sim . As its name suggests you are driving in Europe.

Location:
As the base game  you can drive in the Northeast of France, south of the UK, Luxembourg, Germany, Netherlands and Belgium.

Trucks:
As of trucks you get pretty good choices of the more modern trucks. But if you want to you can add mods. Truck dealers are MAN, Volvo, Iveco, Renault, Mercedes and Scania. Most of the community recommends Scania or Mercedes.

Settings:
The settings are great in my opinion. You can costumize almost everything. ETS2 supports steering wheels. But you can also srive with a keyboard or controller.

DLC:
The biggest drawback in ETS2 is that for almost anything you want to add to the game you need to buy DLCs. We now to groups of DLCs. 1. Map extensions, 2. Tunning extensions. Map extensions are priced around 19.99‚Ç¨. Tunning extensions go for 10‚Ç¨. The older DLCs get bigger discount's while newer smaller ones.

Conclusion:
Euro truck simulator 2 is an great game. And the developers are doing a great job at updating and making DLCs. With a few drawbacks, like the pricing of the DLCs. The game receives a 9.5/10."

8233,Very good game !!!!!!!!!!!
8234,"First of all I want to say that I'm playing this game since 2021.

This is a game certainly worth spending the money for. That is easy ... all elements you'll find in a real life trucker's life, you'll find in the game. You can make the gameplay as easy as you want but also as hard as you want. And then I'm talking about the controls which you can choose to put on all automatic or trying to do everything yourself by deactivating that automatic stuff. The more you challenge yourself as being a virtual truck driver the more interesting this game gets! Aside from that the graphics are marvelous which means you can really enjoy every little detail on the trucks and - not to forget - the environment.

If you want to take it a little bit further than just the game itself you can go for the truckersmp multiplayer modification which is free to get and use! This will provide you the chance to drive with your friends in a huge multiplayer environment. And from that you can even take it a bit more advanced by joining a VTC (Virtual Trucking Company).

As you can see the developers of both the game itself and the multiplayer environment are providing us with more than enough material to keep you busy for the rest of your gaming days!"
8235,"I love this game one of the best games i have played in a while , I have just bought a Logitech G29 So i can play this game with more immersion/Roleplay. So far i have went on 3 IRL hour convoys what have been great. I 100% recommend this game to people like me or who like simulator games"

That's when I found out I deserved better. Every Romeo has to meet Juliet. As soon as I saw a Scania V8 with an old skool steering wheel, I realized right then that Euro Truck Simulator 2 was the right one, I left my old girlfriend and took my new love interest. We are currently in a happy relationship. I plan to spend thousands of hours, maybe remembering my existence, Euro Truck Simulator. Wedding invitations are made, if anyone is interested. Thank you for all the memories made, and the most to come. I love you, Euro Truck Simulator 2"

8373,"its a truck simulator, you can drive trucks 10/10"
8374,I have played this game for a while now and where i fist found it hard to start out it does become easier with time. the graphics are good and the AI are OK for how old the game is but they can still be improved by more realistic driving. The rucks are good and so is the level of detail that you are able to see. My overall opinion of the game is its good and well worth the buy if you like this type of game the steering wheel support is fantastic too but i wish it was more realistic in terms of fully turning the wheels for u turns and so on. Over all i recommend the game.

8453,Good game
8454,"Euro Truck Simulator 2 is that rare thing, a strong sim tethered to a strong game. Where other vehicle-obsessed devs seem to take player motivation for granted, Czech studio SCS understand that a pleasingly modelled steed needs a pleasingly modelled environment to shine. On this occasion that environment is a swathe of Europe stretching from Plymouth in the west to Wroclaw in the east, from Aberdeen in the north to Milan in the South. The tangle of motorways and major roads is stylised and condensed, but feels massive."

8485,"TLDR: if you like the demo you will love the game; try the demo.

First off, I played the demo, before purchasing the game, which I would recommend to anyone interested in this game rather than watching YouTube videos of people with ¬£4000 computers with steering wheels.

Second, I also use an Xbox controller to play the game only using the keyboard for certain things like loading the game up and adjusting settings.  The game can be played exclusively with a controller and is a cheaper alternative to an expensive steering wheel; also the rumble effect works too which helps.

Would I recommend this game?  If you liked the demo then obviously yes I would as the demo is a 3 hour timed version of the game; not sure if it is the actual retail version or just the demo version, but I do think the retail version looks and runs better.

The game is fun and enjoyable and the included radio stations are amazing; lots to enjoy there.  The graphics are good (for a game like this, much better than Farming Sim games) and the driving mechanics are excellent and enjoyable.

I only use a few mods which are easy to install from the game's mod-menu and only include minor changes as there is very little that needs changing.  

If people are concerned about mods outside of the steamworkshop I would say they are not necessary as the map booster pack (which is what I recommend https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/5555/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2_Map_Booster/) is enough to start and gives you a lot of places to visit.

Thank you to SCS Software for making such a good game and I look forward to future updates (and hopefully a next-gen console version!!!!!)  please!!."

2. Roads & Weather simulation is cool.
3. Real time experience and fun, relaxing 
4. Cities and Game design improved a lot.
5. Introduced new Maps, roads & traffic

Dislikes:
1. Needs to improve vehicle features.
for example the highest engine capacity of scania V8 770 HP) not in the list.
2. Poor Breaking sensitivity for every truck
3. No off roads
4. Vehicle lighting system not better than American truck simulator
5. Improve motion bar effects
6. Need to add some more trucks
7. Cars and other vehicles not that much expectations reached.
8. Snow weather couldn't see in the game mods
9. Need add reverse parking camera.

8496,"Good relaxing game, but I wouldn't recommend the DLC as you spend a lot of the time driving round in pitch black darkness, so you wouldn't get to see much of the scenery. Plus if your a safe driver your eyes are looking forward at the road anyway. Just get the base game."
8497,FUN !!
8498,"Driving on the road while listening to the radio, just what I needed"
8499,"Driving around in virtual Europe while listening to the radio or a good podcast is a surprisingly enjoyable and relaxing experience. An acquired taste, perhaps, but still a good game."
8500,"The most important thing to note about this game is that the folks from the company take special care.
If you're into a very chill game and likes the slight idea of working on freights and sightseeing, this game represents it with the best of its capacity."
8501,best !!
8502,das
8503,"It's 9 years old and still strong. That is basically all you need to know.

It has a lot of trucks, most of the Europe by now, they are regualrly updating legasy locations and the engine itself.

Whlile I might want a direct access to configuration files to set LOD/shadow distances and somtimes angry at blind AI, I spent almost 500 hours in the game and it got me througth a lot, when I needed to a safe space to be with myself and think or just relaxt after a hard day."
8504,"[h1] This is the best simulator on the market [/h1]

I played with some other simulators like OMSI, Bus Simulator, etc. but none of those satisfied my needs for a driving simulator. Then I met ETS2...
Do you have enough of the russian screaming kids in CSGO, or the guys in Rocket League who admittedly banged your mom last night? Well, well, this is your game then! No madness, just chill driving with beautiful landscapes!

This game constantly gets improvements, and has so many cool DLCs that you'll probably find whatever pleases you.

I  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game. Really. 

And finally, a list of improvements I'd like to see in the future. I will come back and check anything that's been added.

    - I'd like to have winter and snow in the game. Would be fun to drive in different conditions.
    - I'd like to see animals and other hazards on the roads which would also make the driving more versatile."

8520,"Who would have ever thought that a Euro Truck Simulator would get a rating this high? This simulator is one of the most relaxing games ever, but can also be very intense when carrying fragile cargo. The scenery is beautiful. When it rains in game, I get the same warm feeling inside as when it rains in real life. I give it a perfect score because I just can't find anything ""wrong"" with it. Get this game."
8521,awesome gameplay u can buy and enjoy daily realstic drive feeling 100/100

8524,"Game is fun and the world is very beautiful. However, do not try doing online contracts. Every time I try to do an online World of Trucks External Contract, I will drive, deliver the load and be hit with a message box, ""Synchronizing your progress with World of Trucks"". About 25% of the time it will go through and the assignment will complete. The other 75% of the time it will hang. No matter how long I wait for it to process (I waited once over an hour) it will not sync up, so I have to hit cancel and restart the game to resync with World of Trucks. However, doing that sets me back usually 300km away from my destination. So I have to drive another 300km, THAT I'VE ALREADY DRIVEN, just to back my trailer in AGAIN, to complete the contract. This translates to another 15 minutes real time I have to redo what I've already done because SCS's servers cannot connect for whatever reason. It is not my internet connection either. I've done all the troubleshooting I can and every 'solution' proffered has not solved this issue.

It is extremely aggravating to spend an hour and a half on a contract just to redo the last 15-20 minutes because World of Trucks cannot connect. So if you're wanting to truck offline, fun game. But if you're wanting to partake in the online community events, plan on adding an extra 300km to your drive and having to park the trailer in twice.

Edit: I am playing a clean install. No Mods, just the official DLC."
8525,"Ta bueno, es un juego re chill y jugarlo con amigos rinde para charlar mientras te pegas un palo a 90km/h"
8526,nice
8527,ETS2 is one of my favorite games of all time. There is so much to do and explore in the base game that you won't need any DLC for a long time. The very large modding community is also a very good part of the game.

My last session, i was playing for 7.5 hours and it probably felt like 4 hours! time flies when you have fun.
Even better with friends! Not talking about online as i still havent tried it, but just taking shifts with some friends and grinding for hours and getting the good feeling of either upgrading your truck, buying or upgrading garages and hiring new people for your company."

8543,Dobra za potapanje kupusa
8544,"Amazing game, worthy of overwhelmingly positive status. All of the mechanics and visuals work flawlessly to create an engaging experience. While the premise of the game seems incredibly boring from the exterior, you won't understand how great it is until you have played it (I recommend the demo, gives limited time access to the full base game). Even though this is a simulator, it can be as hardcore or casual as you like depending on your gameplay settings. You do not need to be interested in trucks to enjoy the game. Sit back, relax, and enjoy."

8604,"The fines are a frikin problem, get a red light while still turning? you get a fine for that. Got a car ramming into you at high speed?(while turning at a junction or just driving normally) there's a fine for that. Too bored or thought that your too rich? get a random fine for crashing in to a car for no reason. Yes i got fined for nothing the closest car was like miles in front of me there was no car in the near vicinity other than the ones i'm carrying but getting a fine for what crashing a non-existent car? and lastly my speed was just at the limit of 80 but suddenly its maximum speed limit dropped from 80 to 50? well bad luck you get fined for that like really? I know there's a police car beside me but he was speeding too so was the other cars and that truck behind me why am i getting charged for that! Its like the NPCs are making me go bankrupt when I'm already having a hard time keeping to schedule to deliver fragile like trailers that can break with a light scratch on time while earning almost nothing if that's what you devs planed then wow you people need help(like from professionals who knows more about truck driving and laws and just everything about trucks and everything about real world physics and i dunno roads? objects on the roads?). after 3 hrs+ of game play i can say the game was fine but the fines... it needs a lot of working on especially those darn NPCs, cause only the player in this world gets fined and you know it. So I as an individual or maybe others is asking for an update on those problems like please change it so that I don't keep losing my money to ramming cars and accidentally running a red light while speeding at 80 since the GPS just never tell you about anything and told you to turn in which straits in to a red light...and got a fine .___. it was dark and night time so i was darn pissed about it. I'm not sure if its just me that's having this problem but I'm sad because these damn things are so common throughout my game play."

8624,"A couple of simple questions to ask yourself:

Do you like driving?
Do you like exploring?

Get this game!

No seriously, this game has been the gem of the decade, I've played the first early version in 2012 and it was rough, but it just absolutely matured into a special masterpiece. Every time you log on, you will have a damn good time! I send all my love to the devs, they've put all their passion and faith into this machine (hehe) of a game and they've delivered big time! They've finished off the decade by adding the cherry on top, a freaking multiplayer mode in order to truck with your mates!

A trully complete game 10/10

For devs: Thank you for bringing such a spectacular map of Europe into the digital realm, me and many other have always wanted to explore the world as much as possible in any sort of way and you guys made a lot of it possible, we thank you with the utmost respect! All of us are extremely excited for Heart of Russia to come out, but we ask you to take as much time as you need to polish it up completely, just like with the rest of the game. Love you all!

Oh, and one small suggestion. If you get to that point where you want to start improving the whole map all together by adding more cities, please consider Oradea my home town which is located right next to the Bors border between Hungary and Romania (you probably already know this). The city has transformed into a hidden treasure of Europe in the last decade, exactly like this game!"

Still only just scratched the surface, and have plenty more to do.  I'm sticking with 1.42.x atm as I've got the mods just how I like them, and I'll wait for 1.43 to settle down, then I can then mod away. Recommended yes, expense: depends how deep you want to go. 

Highly recommend if you're wanting to cut your teeth on a driving sim."

There isn't a specific mechanic or part of gameplay I can point to and say ""this is really fun"", but something about driving your truck through the countryside is incredibly relaxing and stressfree.

Pick it up on sale, along with the older DLCs as they're usually at a steep discount. France, Italy, and Scandinavia are excellent starting points in my opinion."

spent the last 20 mins on boring lonely road.

Refunded.
Well, time to find something that I actually enjoy."

I have played ETS 2 for years and added maps plus a few additions but you are not forced in to these by the developers plus you can leave the game and return at any point without loosing your progression also enables you to listen to music or internet radio while driving along with friends and family if you so wish, the only thing you need is a will to drive a truck around Europe."

8725,"I never thought I would say this but I enjoy playing this game, it might seem all basic and boring to you but sometimes that's what we need, I highly recommend purchasing it especially if you enjoy playing driving games while listening to your favorite music."
8726,Ntalika reeeeeee!!!!
8727,"Awesome. I would gladly recommend more community events and more trucks setup. Also i would recommend 2 more things which i consider useful :
1. To be able to reserve a cargo while i m on my way to that city and i m transporting another cargo.
2. To be able to see different type of cargos, using a filter, to show me the cargos that i m able to pick up with my trailers, even if i have a a trailer parked. Because sometimes i get better offers on a container for example instead of my refrigerated trailer. I can see container cargos on the market only if i attach my container trailer and sometimes you are loosing too much time doing that. Would be better if you can select your type of cargos you wanna pick depending on the trailers you have."

There are a few minor things to improve for VR, but still great. Being able to join a convoy with some friends and communicate over radio are things I really enjoyed during my first trips, so more experienced players can help you in realtime. 

Totally recommended!"

8867,"Simply the best game when it comes to driving simulation. Since its launch in 2012, it has got better and better every time through its regular updates and patches. I wish after adding all European countries in future, if they could launch Indian Truck Simulator having Indian Truck Brands like TATA, Mahindra or Ashok Leyland. That would be a great hit.

The map is good in newer parts however Great Britain needs a major revamp in a future update. The game's price is extremely low during a sale and so are the DLCs.

Buy a lorry and then go pick up a trailer full of fresh tuna from the depot.

Drive slowly out the port and notice you have been driving on the wrong side of the road for 5 mins! Get to your destination and earn your money for your company only to find out that your other drivers are spending more on petrol than delivering cargo.

I just wish they had a used truck dealer, besides buying a new truck for a 100 grand."

I complained to a friend and told him I was going to delete the game because I was bored. And he told me - how can this game be boring for you? These white lines on the road calm and hypnotize me, and I laughed and said I want fun, not hypnosis or second job from game :) Anyway, did i tell you this game is boring? 3/10"

9009,"Truck driving simulator with an autistically anal kind of accuracy
Trucks are realistic, scenery and towns? 2014 graphics; not even close.
Rarely crashes and aside from auto-reversing trucks, very few bugs

Controls? Pretty much how children think driving lorries would be like
Not even remotely realistic, even if you turn all the settings on
Roads? They're 10m strips that don't tick off as ""unlocked"" until driven down

This means driving every way around every junction if you want to complete the game
Handbrake (space) is the best brake - use it everywhere (turn off auto in options)
Stick to quick jobs till 10 NPCs (to cover costs) then buy a truck to explore with

Give NPCs the cheapest Iveco, balance skills (1 all) > long dist to max > balanced
Turn off fines and, when you've learned to slow down for corners, speed limiters
Use Convoy Mode to take rest breaks when you can't afford the time penalties

Simple Parking - Camera 3 to line up after driving close
Skilled Parking - Camera 2 to reverse, face the cab, left to move the back end left

Best for Exploring? Basic Scania + 6x2/4 + 730HP + 6 Speed Gearbox
Best for Trucking? Basic Scania + 8x4/4 + 730HP + 12 Speed Gearbox
Truck & Trailer ""upgrades"" are cosmetic only and increase your repair costs

Interest calculates daily in game and there's no early repayment fees
Max loans out at the start and invest early to build your empire

6/10 - About as fun as mowing the lawn if your garden was the size of europe

Issues: 

Seems to have some passive racism though as all drivers on the roads are white
Quick Job Truck damage costs nothing to repair and Trailer damage is meaningless
Employers don't care about crashes and Ratings are pointless"

9062,"I can't state in mere words how much I've grown to love this silly truck game.

1370+ hours in and I'm not regretting one singular second of playing this game.
I'm coming clean here: I love driving. I love travelling. This game combines both and adds to this a 1:19 (with the UK a little larger at 1:15) scale Europe that manages to be at the same time both quirky and highly realistic considering the limiting scale. You see little landmarks in the skyline of a city, or along the road, or pass a major bridge which you might recognise if you've ever driven around Europe. I've visited many of the cities that are represented in this game's world in real life, and I must say that especially the newer-released ones - the ones in the recent DLCs - really are spot-on. The liminality of travel is there and if you're into roadtrips you'll definitely love this game, even if you've got nothing for trucks (beware, it WILL grow on you eventually). Be ready for some driving time though because every 19 km travelled in-game equals one real km travelled on the in-game map, and this adds up on longer journeys from one end of the map to another - trips can take several IRL hours at its most extreme because of this!

There are still some areas that haven't much changed since the game originally released (2012) but those are slowly getting revamped bit by bit. I've not seen any other developer still caring so much about a game this popular nine years after an initial base game release. There's still DLC getting released plus the main game, and even existing DLC also get free content updates on a fairly regular basis. Speaking of this, the trucks themselves are pretty great vehicles, all of them licensed and highly detailed, plus there's loads of customization options you can choose from - especially if you've bought the Cabin Accessories DLC (which I highly recommend buying with the base game!). Driving physics are top-notch, and I've never seen a driving sim this realistic yet still this accessible - you can choose from multiple control schemes from simple to highly complex, making this game even accesible to the most casual of gamers (or even those with no IRL driving license and no clue how to drive ;P). Recently the game also added a co-op mode called 'Convoy', which should by the time I'm writing this also have support for mods.

The map DLCs are pretty much essential imho if you want to get a variety of diverse and good-looking places to go - the newer the DLC the better the quality is a good rule of thumb. The question of buying the other DLCs (paintjobs, new cargoes, tuning parts) is more of a matter of personal taste, and I with my poor judgement shouldn't say too much on those I think ;P.

Graphics-wise it should run pretty good on mid-range PCs - I've even played it modded on a laptop earlier with little issue. If you're using lots of mods though the game is demanding on your GPU - I've maxxed out mine whilst playing with lots of mods more than once. At it's best the game is really great-looking though, it's possible in places to take screenshots that could easily be mistaken for actual photographs ;P.

If you're trying to get any serious driving done in this game, then definitely use some of the excellent map mods around. They enhance the experience even further, you get new areas, you get rebuilds of existing areas that the game's developers haven't yet come around to - in many cases I've found these to be even more enjoyable and realistic than the vanilla map areas. I've been to places as diverse as Kazakhstan, Egypt or Svalbard using map mods. Be prepared though to spend a lot of your time behind the wheel and you better have a good graphics card and like an extra 30 free GB of storage for the mod files if you're using them all at once ;P.

Overall this has been a nothing but a great experience. I've played this game regularly since 2014 and I still periodically return to it for new adventures on the road (could you imagine?). If you're into relaxing driving in any way, shape or form, play this game. It is worth every penny you'll put into it."

Even though the braking, acceleration, and turning are all slow, your heart rate gets up as you plow through intersections and try to find the exact limits this truck can perform without receiving tickets, accidents, and major damage.  When you want to relax, you can drive the truck like a responsible person and enjoy the scenery.  Either way, you're building your trucking business and driving across different parts of Europe.  I have the Going East DLC as well and that has been really nice to have too.  Highly recommend this game to anyone hoping to have fun in a slightly unorthodox way."

9177,I personally love trucks and trucking in general so for me it makes this game cooler lol. Plus with the customization it adds to this game quite a bit. I think both this game and American truck sim are REALLLY good. (If anything I'd want more tire sizes but its not that big of a deal for me.)
9178,Amazing game. Amazing graphics for the time (2012 release I believe). Just fun and relaxing to play.

9187,"You dont have to appreciate trucking or deliveries to truly get immersed. It's the little things for me that matter, like, setting your favorite radio station from real life, in game. Bought myself a g29 and mapped every button to my liking and got a better experience overall. 

It's a beautiful game, relaxing. After a long day at work, I love to have a bit of ""headspace"" playing this. If you want to ""get more real"", plug in your VR headset and get going!

9225,"Pretty basic, although if you put setting's like tiredness on and make your suspension zero (they should be default on tbh) you can make a game out of this.

With the games default settting's it's all but impossible to really crash or get a challenge and it's just a relaxing game (well sim if you like) so i do HIGHLY recommend you make the game as hard as possible if you want to play it more as a game than a sim.

It's a 4/5 as it is sold as a simulator rather than a game and having huge option's allow you to tailor it to suit how you want to play it.

9342,"I'm still just a newbie compared to others out there and have only just started playing but this game absolutely blew me away.
It's an absolutely amazing Truck Sim, looks and performs spectacular and is so much fun with my sim driving rig, and with support for a wide range of USB devices and multiple ones at once, it can be played with all kinds of sim setups.
Great graphics with different weather and a day/night cycle which can be dramatically improved with mods, as well as probably the best AI vehicle behaviour I've seen in a video game.
10/10 would definitely recommend to anyone that likes trucks and driving sims.
Can't wait to play ATS too once I've 'completed' this one :)"
9343,This it the best Trucking Simulator for European Trucks..Thanks SCS Team.
9344,"The very first SCS game that I played was the original Euro Truck Simulator; and goodness did I play the heck out of it.

Discovered this game awhile after, and there is a night and day difference in the gameplay!

There are THOUSANDS of MILES of roads to explore across numerous European states, as well as several different makes and models of trucks to drive, too. The attention to detail in the countries and vehicles is SUPERB, for the most part. The graphics and landscape is beautiful, and never struggles to impress.

The one thing that this game (and American Truck Simulator) is lacking is soft body physics. It's a little boring ramming into something and having the truck just stop and not obliterate itself into a million pieces. Other than that it's a good game and I highly recommend it!"

9380,"good

9381,"I'm highly recommending the game so far (after 22 hours played). As for most of the past 20 years and counting, I've mainly played FPS games, however, I got this game as a recommendation from a friend who's got around 800hrs on it and told me he finds it relaxing. I've kinda made fun of him for playing it, so figured I'd give it a shot. Doesn't hurt to try a new game to play.

To my surprise, the game is extremely relaxing, as I put my headphones on and blast on music and then truck away for hours. For someone that even hates driving IRL, this game has made me calmer in traffic and feel less stressed in both the game and real life.

The game itself has amazing functions such as opening your shop, hiring drivers, buying trucks, or just driving around for fun. You can control the weather & random events on the roads as well which is nice.
So if you're looking for a game that you can chill with friends and just have a game or want to calm down, this is a game that you should buy IMHO.

5/5 rating on it!"
9382,"Realistic!

9391,I always play this game on TruckersMP which is I guess a mod so you can play online. But game is a nice calm driving game. Nothing special. It just has that odd feeling. Really good when you hit the truck in front of you and go flying 8 thousand feet in the air.
9392,i was worth every fuking cent and I aprove this message
9393,good soup
9394,this game so excited to meÔºÅlove this game
9395,"Life Changing. Only way I can describe this game.
My time used to be taken up producing websites, creating spreadsheets and fixing computers for friends and family. But ever since I purchased ETS2 I have been living in a whole new world. First was the purchase of a wheel, pedals and gearstick, soon followed by a third screen, and before I knew it a 4th screen. Not happy sitting at my computer desk, this led to designing and building my own simulation rig. My old i7 was doing okay, but the Nvidia 960 graphics card was being pushed to its limits, so last month I raided the penny jar and now have a powerful i9 10th edition with an Nvidia GTX 3060. I've now fitted my old CB (minus aerial at the moment), obtained a real van instrument panel, and purchased an Arduino board to make it all work (once I find someone who understands it better than me) plus a few USB joystick controllers and a load of buttons to finish of the build of the dashboard.

I'm planning to stream and create Youtube videos, so have just fitted a professional Mic and connected better cameras, so things are nowhere near how they used to be.

I run both ETS2 and ATS, but I don't know many, so despite attempting to join the convoy section I have yet to experience it with others. so if you are hosting a convoy session, then please feel free to invite me."

9420,"Euro Truck Simulator evolved in the right direction.
With little and bigger updates, that still launch to this day and with the relativ new convoy function, we can say that ETS2 is a great game and you get a nice gaming experience. In my opinion, with all the options you get without & with DLC's, ETS2 has a lot of freedoms and because of the ability to add various modifications to ETS2, you also get the chance to enhance your game and make your experience even better. With the Map DLC, you get a lot of new countries to explore and almost double of the normal map. And lets not forget ProMods, with comes with a lot of new countries for just 1‚Ç¨. ETS2 showed me how much is possible to develope into one single game and its a game, that still updates on a regular basis, even though the game been out for so long now!

They switched , by fly, from Direct X 9 to Direct X 11 and the transition , let me tell you it was very smooth. The community helped when the game was in its beginnings and that counted a lot.

They have been releasing good DLC's but not only that THEY HAVE UPDATED older ones and revamping them like the new Lyon city revamp in France. They bring constant new stuff and it makes me feel like this studio is one of the very few to not go EA or R* mode on its consumers. Support the game if you like but research well."

Even though I am more of a train fan, I like the time management aspect to the game, the strategy needed to be successful. Highly recommend it."

The game feels and looks old, I want ETS 3.

9531,"Maybe the best open world game I've ever played, along with it's American cousin. I run it on a 500 dollar laptop, WASD keyboard and it's rarely a problem for me. The DLCs make a very large map and there's a strong modding community, which, a year after I've started playing, I'm still finding great new stuff on often. There was the option of a free preview for me a year ago, highly suggest you run that first, mostly to see how your hardware stacks up. Even my 5 year old laptop could run a low res, low fps version. Highly Recommend!"
9532,It seems like a fun game to play.

9582,nice
9583,"This is one of the best simulator games I've ever played. Looks great, works fine, has enough variation, good realism, no steep learning curve. I just like to drive and look around in all these great good looking environments/countries. I've had many car accidents just because I was too much looking at and enjoying the landscape instead of keeping the eyes on the road.

I would enjoy it more if there were a bit more local roads. So a less high percentage of highways. What also sometimes frustrates me is that when the game updates, it sends my truck back to the garage. I understand that it is good for stability, it is safe to do it that way. But it is not nice to lose the progress on a job. A solution could be to allow the user to decide when to update (e.g. update after current cargo is delivered). Not sure if that is possible."
9584,"no thoughts. only truck.
no sad when truck.
truck is good."

 I had a broken hand when I first bought this game back in 2012. I remember being told, not to participate on our shity writing assigment which was given by our sadistic milf teacher, and bru I remember playing it all the week while my stupid-ass classmates were working their ass off. The feeling of that relief was amazing when it combined with this amazing sandbox road shit. (I MISS MY FUCKING CHILDHOOD!! THE TIMES WHEN I FELT LIKE A REAL HUMAN BEING!)"
9638,nice game.
9639,best game ever download now and play it with truckers mp to get more than 4000 people online with on the road
9640,"You can really lose yourself in this game. Very funny to play it with the boys and can annoy each other. The radio to talk to each other is sick, and the fact the truck has a radio as well is amazing, some good bops on there. Generally a game you can sit and chill out to tho."
9641,"Before I played Euro Truck Simulator 2, I had a small pp, no friends, no gf, depression, and no life. These things haven't changed, but the game is pretty good

9689,"If you're looking for a game to very slowly grow your bank account as a trucker, or you're looking for a game where you hypnotically drive on a road for an hour to hours before receiving a meager reward than I suppose this is what you're looking for.

It's kind of as thrilling as real driving which I suppose can be relaxing so put on a podcast and adjust your cruise control for hours!"

9782,your mom is pretty cool & nice ;)
9783,"its a great game , especially with steering wheel ,  i liked that you not only drive trucks but also building you own trucking business by buying more trucks and hiring drivers , 
also more experience you gain , more money you make , better trucks you can buy  so it will keep things interesting . 

disliked only that graphics are a bit old , could be much better  , so hopefully will get a big update on that eventually

i would recommend this game"

9794,"I have been a long time player of ETS2 and first bought it on disk back in 2012. 

I came back to playing ETS2 back in 2018 and still play regularly. 

I love this simulator and find both its community and customer service excellent. 

I‚Äôve live streamed many of my gameplays and have all the map DLCs combined with supported mods such as ProMods - this simulator is amazing. 

Best played with the Logitech G29, shifter and pedals with the combination of tobii eye 5, giving this simulator a great immersive experience. 

During lockdown this was the only way for me to travel and explore Europe. Having been to several of the places in game in real life. I appreciate the attention to details by the developers. 

The more recent ability to convoy with other real players is a great asset. 

Highly recommended!"

9800,good
9801,"Every place looks the same, no landmarks, no difference between the expensive countries that were all extra and offer very little. Just basic highway, always the same buildings and yards. Some countries, which again were expensive and extra, are basically three roads of flat, boring terrain with nothing on it. Really disappointed. American Truck simulator is much much better."
9802,good game
9803,very gooodddd soo get it
9804,"Its a very good game but can definitely be enhanced with mods. If you are the impatient type, hacks to progress you through the game ultra fast are available on the Steam Workshop and on mod websites. Overall a solid 8/10 and with mods it could reach 10.
Good game definitely recommend for its somewhat low price. :)"

9880,"This game is suitable for those who like to drive by looking at natural scenery. I don't know if the trucks here are realistic or not, but I'm happy with this game. although there are some things that I don't like, like bugs in the game, then illogical things (hit the rail crossing with the truck and the truck bounced flying, hit another player's truck and the truck bounced all over the place). please make it more real"

9930,"Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a [b]great game[/b] to play alone (there's also plenty of mods!) as well as with friends. The developers are still delivering great free updates as well as map expansion DLCs (which are mostly cheap during any Steam sale) and other contents - they have released an official online ""co-op"" mode with mod support just this year!
I've never really played any driving simulator or anything similar before. Now, after more than 200 hours of playing vanilla, modded singleplayer, and the awesome community-made inofficial multiplayer, I can't help but recommend EVERYONE to give this game a try.
You won't regret it."

Alot changed through years, new lightning system, sound and graphics improvements but most important convoy multiplayer, the best thing ever, including mod support, this game is close to perfection, needs some optimization for mid budget pc but overall it is an outstanding game and only one trucking game in the gaming industry, nothing compares to SCS Euro Truck and American Truck. Playing with my friends and family, recommending to everybody."

9970,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
9971,"Great game, for someone who loves casual driving."
9972,I wish to tell you my thoughts about this game 1. the game had problems whit launching and it made me unhappy 2. the game felt like it was fun like i mean when you look at the screenshots and stuff but it wasn't and it was boring and had lots of issues.
9973,this is just a all around great driving experience trucking  game
9974,"very cool and educational game, i like to play with friends, very funny!"
9975,"i've been playing on keyboard and mouse cause i can't afford a cool set up, but it's still somehow pretty fun. it's really a sit back and relax sort of game, but you can drive through europe in a like... an hour instead of several, and also no climate impact on your journey!"

9980,"Good graphicks but it is a little bit hard to earn money.
Still a great game tho"
9981,amazing
9982,"Bought this game a few year back, tryed a few times, but found the graphics werent so good as i thought and driving a truck wasnt easy to learn. So i let it rest. 
Now i try it again with a new  G29 steering wheel, it works well, the graphics look very good now too. I give it a try and start learning again (specially going backwards).  It surprises me that driving the truck in the highway is very comforting, and you have the good sensation of going in a big machine.  The landscape, the sights, all very nice. You can see all the tipical features you would find on specific road, like particular bridges, constructions and monuments. 
The game is about delivering stuff and making your own truck company, the fun is in the relexing driving, the challenging driving, the scenery and views."

10047,"I started off in American Truck Simulator earlier this year 2021. I really enjoyed that so much... that  I decided to try Euro Truck simulator also.  Euro Truck Simulator is very relaxing, fun, and challenging. I additionally feel - it is educational too! I only have real life experience driving in the States and Canada, so learning the European and Scandanavian road systems, signs etc was fun. Additionnly I love and love geography as a hobby and though I know many major cities in Europe, learning the smaller ones driving the truck was very educational an helps one learn ""what"" is ""where""? Best of all the landscapes and video graphics for everything are beautiful and game play quite realistic. I would recommend Euro Truck Simulator to all who love simulators or if you have done American Truck sim... you gotta try this too. Its great!"

10148,"I would recommend it to anyone with a proper controller or wheel. I do feel like it still lacks many features to make it feel real. My truck stays spotless no matter how many nights I sleep in it or dirt roads I drive on. When I saw ""myself"" standing besides the truck with both feet clipping through the ground and my whole body had less polygons than my left mirror.. It just felt off. Compared to other sims in general this still very much feels like a game."

10160,"I owe this game a review since this is the game I played the longest so far. It still amazes me that this game has captured my heart 7 years ago and does not want to let it go. For most people it would seem that driving a truck would get boring quickly. However all that work the game developer (SCS Software) has put into this game has been keeping it alive and well for the last 9 years. And definitely it's not the end. New content (i.e. trucks, locations) being constantly added, some of the existing stuff being revised and revamped, interesting community challanges every now and then do not go unnoticed by the devoted community of this game. Huge library of mods for this game also requires mentioning. Some of the modders have been updating their mods for almost as long as the game exists. This just shows that the game is truly unique. And the best part is that it's never too late to become part of this community and experience all the (surprising) fun this game has to offer."

10173,"I love the game! Its very nice relaxing, i enjoy the recent addition of the convoys! :)"
10174,like
10175,Really chill driving game. It does have pretty accurate physics and so forth so in a way it does resemble experience compared to actually being a truck driver. What I am amazed of is that the game manufacturer still frequently updates content of the base game and also content to their DLCs. I recently acquired a DLC for this game and was very surprised to see that the company is updating content in their DLC that was released around 2016. This much care for a title that a company has released so long ago is very rare. Appreciated effort!
10176,good fun game + when with friends

10222,"I started playing this game because a friend recommended it to me and because it was in discount, and I must say... I LOVE IT.

I was sceptical at first because the game was released back in 2012, but the fact that it is still being updated really blows my mind. SCS put such a level of detail and love in everything that I'm becoming addicted to it. 
I also thought it could become pretty repetitive, but it doesn't.

Yes, there are some things that are clearly from a 2012 game, like the vegetation, but the stunning view while driving distracts you from noticing it. Also, consider that you're usually driving at least 50km/h, so you won't usually stare at the vegetation.
The multiple DLCs available help in keeping the game fun, mainly the map DLC. But you can have a lot of fun even with the base game (I played for ~36h and I only recently bought a DLC, Italia DLC)

Would totally recommend it, considering that you'll often find it at ~5‚Ç¨"

10313,"Euro Truck Simulator 2 is highly recommended. Here's my review with time logged at Level 13 with 7 of 81 achievements complete. Game was purchased on sale and I just downloaded the Scandinavian DLC so I wanted to share my thoughts to those interested.

I was concerned about trucking doldrums but the tutorial paved the way to my entertainment experience. Starting out is a challenge and when you get your own shop and hire drivers you now have management tasks. You can assign drivers your own trailers and train them the way you want. My graphics work well, soundtrack is good, and game play cool. You will struggle financially of course but your as drivers improve so does your income. The sleep required option does compliment the simulator with the requirement burden. You  can borrow from the bank and have loans active so be careful. Your ability to drive in the UK will be tested adapting to the left lane as well. I'm still in business. Drivers wanted. Have fun!..."
10314,Easily one of the most relaxing games you could be playing. VR support is nothing to scoff at either - it's extremely enjoyable.

---{Graphics}---
Graphics are good, and with community mods you can really make it look beautiful.

---{Gameplay}---
What is there to say other than you drive the truck.

---{Audio}---
Audio is good, there is nothing better than rolling down the window and letting that breeze flow past your ear. Also there are more mods you can install for better audio if you wanted.

---{Audience}---
Anyone who just needs something to play that doesnt have 100+ things going on at once, just you and the open road (AND THE NPCs WHO DONT KNOW HOW TO DRIVE).

---{PC Requirements}---
Do you have a PC? Good enough.

---{Difficulity}---
Controller - Easy
MnK - Easy
Steering Wheel - Easy

---{Game Time}---
How long do you want to drive the truck for? Thats how much you can get out of the game.

10353,"This is one of those games that you pick up when you don't really want to do anything too complicated, filling quite a niche. If like me, you loved the whole hitching a rig to a trailer in GTAV then this is one for you. The trucks look great and the physics can be adjusted from basic acceleration / steering to the full H shifter experience. The customisation features for the trucks and trailers is very in-depth but you'll find yourself spending a lot of your hard earned cash upgrading your first rig.

Sadly the graphics aside from the trucks are not that great and the motorway layouts - particularly in the UK cause a lot of frustration as to how horribly inaccurate they are. For example most junctions have no slip road. The inside lane simply veers off, sometimes only leaving one lane of motorway! Most of the layouts in Europe are not like this so not sure why the devs only did this to the UK? Another bug bear is the traffic offences, where you'll occasionally get fined for improper headlight use in the daytime even though they're switched off. 

Then there's the cities. Ok, I get this is just a simulation and has to be scaled down, but the cities in this game are smaller than most villages in real life and really takes the edge off the satisfaction this game produces. 

Overall, I recommend getting this but only when it's on sale."

10370,"Amazing game. Entertaining, relaxing, therapeutic...

You may think (like I did since the game was released) that this isn't something people could be into, but you'd be wrong. Even if sitting behind a virtual steering wheel all day hauling tons of cargo seems like a waste of time, this game really delivers when it comes to the overall simulation experience, and that's what hooks you.

You'll learn about trucks and truck modifications, Europe's geography, many types of trailers and different cargo types, fuel consumption and fuel economy, and lots more. Not only you are given the truck driving simulation experience, this game also provides that much needed (for most people) sense of progress, be allowing you to build your own truck empire from the ground up, creating your own company and hiring people to work for you. It's just amazing.

If you like to play alone and spend hours in front of your monitor with nothing but your thoughts, maybe listen to some music, some stand-up comedy, or even watch a movie on a second monitor... This is the game for you.

Wait... You don't like playing alone? Well... You can also play with friends or random people through convoy lobbies or even play at a much larger scale on multiplayer lobbies without AI traffic! In that case, this is also the game for you."

10374,"Were to start?
this game has been on my mind since I have been a small child. What started on Windows 98 is still going strong on the latest update. This game has been fun to play ever since I started. 

With DLC's the game can be upgraded quite substational, but it is not nececary to have fun. the base game features a big map and all the Trucks available are free.

With the edition of mods you can really make this game even more intersting. Trucks, Sounds, GPS voicecs and more can be added to further broaden the game.

As a quick summary, this is one of the best games i have ever expirience. It is simple and jet you can spend many hours in one session just driving around and delivering goods.,

10400,"This is a game that's...almost 10 years old.
This game...has rather modest system requirements. Doesn't normally bode well to outstanding graphics or features. 
This is a game about...trucks. Arguably, not typically something to get excited about.

And yet...the thousands of reviews for this game are ""Overwhelmingly Positive"". How?

Well, I haven't played this game that much yet, especially compared to other people (many have put in literally hundreds - and some even thousands - of hours), but I can see why.

The low system requirements mean that you don't need a mega powerful computer to run it. If playing on a laptop, the battery will probably last longer than if playing most other games, too. 

Sure, the graphics do betray the age of the game (both in-game and in the menus), but they're not too bad either imho.

Driving such big and heavy machinery is surprisingly satisfying; being able to manoeuvre this thing - especially parking it - is no mean feat, which adds to the satisfaction when you are able to get it right. Moreover, you get so much functionality - ability to turn on/off lights, wipers, indicators, open/close windows, set cruise control, view fuel consumption...for geeks like me, this is absolute heaven. 

There are some good challenges that spice up the gameplay - keep in mind that this is also a business sim/tycoon game. And it's quite realistic - you can even get fined if you exceed the seed limit!

You also get to transport many types of cargo (and need to adjust your driving style accordingly), and see many sceneries across different countries. And the numerous DLCs further serve to add more [i]good[/i] content (i.e. these DLCs are not merely cash grabs to make a quick buck off of players like you and me, but are actually made with care).

Finally, this game has garnered a large and helpful community, which has also enabled the existence of numerous great mods, and new content is [i]still[/i] being released. This, along with frequent live broadcasts demonstrating the new features, are evidence that this game is made with love. The cherry on the cake is that this game is very reasonably priced, especially during sales (which occur quite frequently). You can't ask for much more than that."

10466,"Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a game about being a truck driver, mostly in Europe and your goal is to make a company.

ETS 2 has a really relaxed gameplay, which also quite addictive. You basically choose a delivery and make your way there with your truck, meanwhile you need to manage your vehicle and your company later in the game. You can also level up in different delivery types which let you have different cargo, which also needs different equipment too. In general, this is a simple, but great idea, but probably the only thing I can nitpick on, is that the base game has not too many places to go and those doesn't look that different from each other. Of course, at first this is not big of a deal, but later it will be more noticeable, where you get into 4 different cities which has somewhat the same layout. Thankfully this issue is somewhat fixable with the DLCs, which is not that cheap sometimes, but those definitely add some bonus content, which makes the game a hundred times more likeable.

Next is the graphics, which for 2012 is all right. In general, most of the models looks decent, just like the environment, but it has a plastic feeling just looking at it in my opinion. With a few mods this can be also changed, but for me, this is not the strongest point of the game, but definitely not a horrible one either.

The sound design is also really good. There are not too many music in the game, except if you listen a radio, but there is no need. If you want to listen something, go ahead, but the game give you the minimum sound you need, which are not annoying and perfectly fits for the game.

About the controls, I won't lie, it was bit difficult for me to get into and understand which button do what. It's not easy, but you can get used to it and you can check the settings all the time. There are lot of actions you can do, so it's definitely worth it to check these.

At last, the story. I will be straightforward, the game has none, and this is not a problem. You don't need it actually, you make your own story with your journeys, going around the world and you don't need more motivation, than to just make your deliveries between countries.

For me, Euro Truck Simulator 2 wasn't and interesting game at first, but throughout the years, the game has so much plus content and I didn't even mentioned the convoy mode, which makes the whole experience just better. This is the game which I pick, if I want to chill for a moment, just to drive out and it's perfect for that, but also you can put into a lot of effort and make your truck company empire. This is definitely the game you need to check, and I can absolutely recommend it to you. For 20‚Ç¨, you could even pick it for the full price, but get the DLCs on sale."

The devs have recently added the official support for online, name convoy, but I still think the online mod (TruckersMP) is way better in every way. Playing this game alone can be boring and frustrating at times due to the awful AI, but with the convoy feature you can play with up to 8 friends and it can be a lot of fun, but with the TruckerMP mod you can play in server where you can find up to 4000 real people driving trucks, it is better optimized, having a lot of real people can lead to really fun and chaotic moments but at the same time increasing the simulator factor of this game.
All in all, I totally recommend this game to anybody who wants an amazing truck simulator and at the same time a very cool and big community."

10544,"Playing this in VR with a steering wheel is the best experience you can have. VR is the soul reason I play this games. It's probably one of my favorite VR Games.

I do hope they add interactions with the vehicle itself in the future. That would make the experience even better than it is now."

Specialty lorries seem like fun to you?

This game is your ticket to taking on the UK like a king, and finding out how well you can truck your loads across the continent.

This game's traffic AI might still be braindead but the lively sounds of your engine and turbos wont be. A great experience for those interested in having fun in the tight, left side streets of europe.

Have fun getting fined by dickish UK police. Cheerio!"

10636,If you always wanted to drive a truck trough europe this is your chance. The dlc is worth the price if you buy it during promotion. The only down is that the hardware driving weels cost 100 of euro's but you can have a good game experience with a decent game pad
10637,Very relax game but dont hit bankine like me :D
10638,Fun
10639,I like this simulator
10640,"I bought this game as a joke, but bro, I don't think it's a joke anymore........

Generally thinking, it's a pretty simple game concept: you drive a truck from point A to point B and then start another gig, so it's impossible to explain how addicting it gets very fast. It's quite therapeutic actually. 

Eurotruck simulator isn't a very intense experience, but if you're looking for something to play that'll detach you from the real world, I highly recommend this game."
10641,I like this game because i love to drive trucks :D
10642,Realism so good and playing is is kinda soothing and relaxing. But my biggest gripe recently whenever I play this game I started to feel sleepy so I took off not playing this for a while. But this game is really worth paying and playing.

I run a Multi-Million doller International trucking empire, sleeping is for the noobs. this game recieves a perfect 10/10 from me, i have lost everything i have ever loved. but, i do have 20 Volvo trucks now...."
10658,"A very good game,

10692,"Ce jeu est vraiment incroyable. Alors oui c'est pas un jeu qui plaira √† tout le monde ni un jeu auquel vous voudrez jouer tous les soirs (quoi que ?), mais il est parfait pour se relaxer, regarder la route et les paysages sur son √©cran, en √©coutant de la musique et sans avoir √† √™tre tout l temps focus √† 100%... En plus de √ßa le catalogue de mods est tr√®s complet et les DLC ne sont pas du tout essentiels sauf si vous y jouez toute la journ√©e.
Les points n√©gatifs que je peux trouver sont d'abord les ""IA"" qui provoquent parfois des accidents dont on doit payer l'amande, √ßa fait chier mais √ßa reste relativement rare. Pour palier √† √ßa vous pouvez jouer en multijouer gr√¢ce √† un mod, mais attention √† ne pas aller pr√®s des grands axes (Duisbourg - Dusseldorf, Lille - Calais), ou vous risquez de rencontrer des gens plus b√™tes que des IA.
√âgalement si vous √™tes sur Linux, gardez en m√©moire que le jeu va moins bien tournez que sur Windows et vous ne pourrez probablement pas profitez de vos graphismes habituels.

Bref, le jeu co√ªte 5‚Ç¨, il est vraiment complet et est r√©guli√®rement mis √† jour donc si vous aimez les jeux de simulation, foncez."

10768,Incredible and realistic.  My only complaint would be no EU Driver's hours regulations implemented in the game as I think this would have been much more strategically challenging.  Also would love to see gambling slot machines and women on street corners to give it a more realistic edge.

10795,really good game
10796,the most relaxing game ever!! i just enjoy it with the steering wheel
10797,"Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a fantastic game. I'm so happy to have found it - and decided to play, as I had it in my arsenal for a year or two. It's got everything - a need for speed, a need for skill, drama, tension, you actually care, and the devilishly simple premise turns out to be full of twists and turns - literally.

This title blends strategy and simulation in a unique fashion. Some games manage to pull this off, but most either focus too much on one or the other. Yet, somehow, the seemingly most boring concept that could be has been designed into a thrilling, captivating game. Really splendid. I hear there's also American Truck Simulator. Well, you know what that means. A real convoy!

Cheers."

At this game you can see that SCS is working hard to fix issues and improve the Gameplay. For example the fuel prices being updatet constantly. This game wants to you the best simulation experience. And it does. It feels great driving the Truck on constantly updated streets. It is the best simulation which is available right now.

I really like it and if you are interrested of buying this game, do not think much about it. You will not regret it."

10880,very best game
10881,nice game
10882,"Cool, relaxing game that keeps on giving almost 20 years after its original release. Has tons of DLC but none of them are required to have fun and the developer keeps updating the engine to integrate new tech into it, like global illumination, a better sound system, a convoy mode, etc. 

And if you have a wheel this is a blast to play, but beware the rabbit hole as you'll soon [strike]want[/strike] NEED a button box, a truck shifter and a trucker hat!"
10883,"Fantastic game

10884,Best 5 bucks I spent on Steam

10886,"I won it at a give away , i enjoyed it so far , i recommend this as a microwave."
10887,How do i post a review? please help fellow steam forum members...
10888,Very good game for relax <3
10889,"Pretty chill and entertaining gaming, not really strong on the ""simulator"" aspect, but it's good enough to play it using a wheel. 

If you don't care much about traffic laws, you can play like a mad driver speeding through the cities and passing on red lights, the game is pretty lenient about that... not that you should do it, but, hey, you can, if that's what you want.

10930,"I like driving games so I bought this at 75% off many years ago thinking I wouldn't play it much.  It is now the 2nd highest played and the most costly game I own due to all the expansions that have come out, which I also recommended for the best possible experience.

Absolutely awesome simulation, super relaxing gameplay and very active devs that are constantly bringing this 7+year old game forward with new huge map expansions, engine, sound and graphics updates."

10961,you can never out-drive the michelin man
10962,THE BEST OF ALL
10963,Truck goes vroom vroom. It's great!
10964,Nice
10965,"With 500+ hours invested, I can say with confidence that:

- Truck goes BRR
- Crash goes BRR
- Cash go POOF

But other than that, the game is a solid 10/10 driving simulator.
When you drive, you feel the weight you are pulling, you feel every corner you went a bit too fast in and the scenery is truly beautiful (if your PC can handle the settings).

The game also still regularly receives free updates like new truck models, updated textures, updated road networks and for those with a bit of cash there also tends to be a new DLC in the works constantly giving new countries and new landscapes to traverse.

For anyone interested in a good driving game, this is almost a must."
10966,I enjoy driving in the night.
10967,Best game if you want to visit EU countries but due pandemic or laziness can't do that and have some fun in process
10968,As chill as it gets...
10969,da best driving game in the world!!!!!!!!!!!
10970,Damn I love trucks
10971,all this time and sometimes i still go back to this game. still updated to this day its my nomination for labor of love. if you want the best trucking simulator to date look no further than this game i have played this game way more than 14 hours dont know why it shows up like that hahaha but this is the best game there is for someone who loves to drive trust me

10987,This game is awesome. i love how it still runs perfectly on my laptop. the map is really big and i really want to buy the DLC. also this is a really great game to just chill.
10988,"This is a great game. I have not played it as much as American Truck Simulator, but I hope to. Love the trucks because they are very well done in my opinion. So far, my favorites are Scania and MAN. However, I like DAF as well. I have enjoyed every DLC I have bought, although Scandinavia was my favorite. Looking forward to the Russia DLC."
10989,"Good and relaxing game.
If you have time. Nice scenery.
Worth to buy."

You'll get the hang of reversing, but it's pesky at the start.

1.- Actually following traffic rules and being a good truck driver.

2.- Remove speed limit and go 100 km/h swerving in traffic to get from point A to point B as fast as possible.

All jokes aside, the game has incredible graphics, options to upload your own music files to listen as a radio, in case you don't use streaming services on the background; has a ton of truck modification options, both for tuning it for better performance, and to make the interior more cozy to your liking.

Honestly an absolute 10/10 for a game to just sit down, relax, and enjoy the scenery as you drive through some pretty accurate European interstate and highways."

11014,"I love this game.

When you're done driving in real life, you can sit down, relax, load up some ETS2 and experience all the stressful situations you just survived on the roads in real life.

The developers are active within the community and strive to improve the game so it can be the best it can be. I admire that and when you've set it up how you want too using the config file, it can be quite a pleasant, relaxing game.

You can import your own music or listen to REAL radio stations while driving through the night.

Ah, that simulated trucker life is a beautiful thing!"
11015,"It's a really great way to spend some free time and see places you might not have ever been, or will ever go - especially if you're in the states like me. Can be very immersive and I like building up my fleet with new garages, trucks, and drivers across the several different countries they have through their always affordable DLC's. Also a massive mod library in the workshop, if that's your thing."
11016,What can I say I just love hitting the road
11017,very fun stuck in traffic
11018,so good game
11019,yes

This and American Truck Simulator, both released by SCS Software, are great games. The games are constantly being updated and also getting new mat expansions. Also has mod compatibility."
11040,"Although I very much enjoy(ed) playing the game, I would greatly appreciate if the developers would add more depth and emphasis regarding the actual ""simulation"" of trucks and the environment ..."

11094,One Of My Favourite Simulator Game ever
11095,Best of the best in trucking games
11096,"Question comes into your mind: ""Who would play a game where all you do is drive a truck, isn't it boring and a bit lame?"" It's beautiful day outside and you told yourself that you will try out a game for a short time, prove your point and get a refund.

It's 4 am now and you have been selecting truck wheel bolts for last half hours. After that some electronics need to be shipped from Amsterdam to Bratislava. You will get some sleep. In game. On a petrol station."

11151,"Great game. There is almost everything I expect in this game. Except for a few cases, the animation of opening and closing doors - animation of the driver's hands on the steering wheel and animation of gears, clutches and brakes.
Thanks to the game creators. Do not be tired."

11184,"This is the best truck simulator there is. With all the updates and some DLC, the game looks decent and different places vary more. Earlier in the development and maybe with just the base game, every town is/was more or less the same. Could criticize a bit on relatively expensive DLC, but they are also good quality and add depth to the game."
11185,Nice
11186,Very good game simulator

11224,"Ever since I've tried the ETS 1 many many years ago, I've always wanted to try it with the steering wheel controller. So much so that I made a make shift steering wheel using the mouse. 
But now, I have finally managed to buy a Thrustmaster TX, and the first thing I did was purchase the ETS 2.
It might not give the excitement or the adrenaline rush like the other racing games, but there is something about this game that I really can't explain. Something that makes me want to choose it over the other games.

The recent update to the force feedback is also worthy of a praise and has significantly improved the gameplay."
11225,"very fun and chill! allows you to escape reality even if its only for a while, time FLIES when playing this game."

11233,"Very good trucking simulation. It is fun to play for simulation fans aswell as for casual players.
Although i would recommend buying some DLCs alongside the base game. The ""Euro Truck Simulator 2 Essentials"" bundle is a decent choice and worth the money. It adds more countries to the map and some other stuff. 
Every few months a new DLC gets released with new countries and new roads.

If you want to play with friends there is a official multiplayer mode where you can pick a destination and drive in a convoy with friends. However if you want to play multiplayer with up to 4800 players on 1 server i would recommend TruckersMP its not official but it is the better multiplayer mode in my opinion."
11234,Truck go vrm
11235,nice and relaxed game
11236,Great!
11237,"While this game isn't for everyone and doesn't have the most exciting gameplay, it is a great simulation title to just chill. If you have a VR headset and are into simulation games, this is a great title to experience in VR. I highly recommend using at least a gamepad for the controls, a wheel would be best but optional."
11238,"very nice game, if you like drive buy all maps bundle pack."
11239,"very good game, you can buy many cool trucks, customize them to your liking, and drive all across europe."

I love the modding community and everything about this, it's a lovely chill and relaxing game which is fun with friends."
11242,"I thoroughly enjoy player Euro Truck Simulator 2. It's such a relaxing game to play and being able to host convoys to run trips with friends is great.

The DLC is sometimes a bit pricey especially since how many DLC the devs release but overall it's an amazing game I'd highly recommend to my friends"
11243,A good and fun way to pass the time
11244,"surprisingly funny and relaxing game, after playing this I didn't need therapy anymore"
11245,very good game best game
11246,"Honestly, even years later after release, one of the best simulator games out there. Especially if you have friends and driving on Promods map, EAA, RUS map etc. I'd highly recommend getting ETS2 plus all its map DLCs, its worth it!"
11247,...
11248,Bloody love trucks
11249,very good:)
11250,Truck go Vroom
11251,"Surprisingly entertaining and relaxing, excellent developers and community, which keep the game interesting after many years with updates and mods."
11252,"I like the game, it has nice trucks and a big map which resembles the original cities/regions. It is quite fun but not in an arcade way. This is a simulation so damage will cost you your hard earned money.
If you buy that game you will get tons of updates and new content with upcomming DLCs.
For a game this old the graphic looks very appealing...of course it is not state of the art, but for an simulation game it is okay.
Btw. there is even internet radio available so you can hear some nice music while doing your job as an trucker.
Also check out the American Truck Simulator which is also really nice :)

11272,"Euro Truck is an amazing game with endless combinations of Trucks and Trailers. If this game didn't have the ability to have mods, it would have been a dead game for a long long time ago, but here we are today, playing it after 9 years and the community is alive and well and the mod community is amazing and they are always contributing to the benefit of Euro Truck Simulator 2 players and gives the Developers some inspiration to add the mods to a new version of the game and have it as a feature in the game. While the American Truck Simulator community is not as strong as the Euro Truck Simulator 2, they are both equally great games, from the long highways to the small country roads of France and Scandinavia, Euro Truck will never fail to make you happy."

Moreover, this game is beautiful and there are a lot of areas where you can go. Lot of different deliveries with super cool trucks. Plus this game always get the good updates.
I really recommend to anyone."
11281,Great game!
11282,Such a relaxing driving game

11286,love it
11287,"Who would have ever thought that a Euro Truck Simulator would get a rating this high? This simulator is one of the most relaxing games ever, but can also be very intense when carrying fragile cargo. The scenery is beautiful. When it rains ingame, I get the same warm feeling inside as when it rains in real life. I give it a perfect score because I just can't find anything ""wrong"" with it. Get this game"
11288,"Relax. Take your time. The driving game that rewards care, not speed. And a decade on, it is still being actively updated. And that my only criticism is that some of older, as yet not updated, maps are now looking very old indeed, is at once a complement to how good those updates are when they come."

11311,very good and calm game nice to practice driving too highly recomend playing with a wheel
11312,"I got this first as the demo and liked it so much I bought the base game and have since added many DLCs. Beware! You can easily spend many hours playing this!

I like that they not only release new maps and add-ons but also revisit and improve old maps. 

I feel that the game and DLCs are fairly priced, but you can also wait for one of the sales on Steam and buy them at a discount."

11317,Love this game lol
11318,"The thing is, it‚Äôs worth it. It took me less than 80 hours to understand not necessarily how addictive this game is, but how good it makes me feel while playing it. Just as PC Gamer‚Äôs Tim Stone puts it in his review, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is ‚Äúunexpectedly engrossing. Heed the mockers and you'll miss one of the PC's finest and freshest driving games.‚Äù


It‚Äôs the most relaxing vehicle-related game you‚Äôll ever play. I fell asleep playing it and I‚Äôd happily do it again. Luckily, console players will be able to experience this through the promised Truck Driver."

11360,Good game
11361,"I'm not too much into simulators, but it amazes me how this game relaxes me so much.

Sometimes a game isn't only about the biggest plots, the most realistic graphics, non-stop action or well-designed characters...but just a time killer to empty your head from daily stress...and this is Euro Truck Simulator 2.

I love to turn on a fan and point it towards me as I play, immersion ftw!"
11362,"I've somehow achieved the mark of 450 hours and I really have no idea how. It's been almost a year and a half since I bought this game and somehow it's been the game I most play. Does it have an interesting gameplay? No. Is it boring? Yes. Have I spent dozens of dollars on DLCs even though I could've just downloaded a map from the Internet? Yes. At the end of the day this is an amazing game if you have a lot of free time or just want to relax after a long day. You can download mods and maps and drive pretty much wherever and however you'd like. The company which developed the game also seems very passionate about it and that's pretty cool. My friends all make fun of me but it's really not that bad. I'm on my second save because I've done everything in my first one (bought all the garages in the game and expanded them, hired all the drivers, drove through almost 100% of the territory). 

I recommend it if you like simulators (even though I don't find it that realistic) and if you like driving games. If you don't match if these two things at the same time, it might not be for you. :)"
11363,Best Simulator Ever
11364,"Endless time killer, active friendly community, continually updated & in general an amazing dev team!"
11365,Best game for relaxing
11366,"I like trucks, that's all. Very good & relaxing trucking simulator, I wish there was more to it. It's still receiving updates, with Russia coming up, everything's good so far."
11367,"Ah, Euro Truck Simulator 2. A great trucking game of the last decade tons of trucks to choose and customize from trailers to customize and choose and load with cargo. Yep Euro Truck Simulator 2 has it all while most of the base map is mostly out of date and some bits of it being updated on new updates. There're DLCs that let you explore more area's and countries and let you play with map mods that make the experience more enjoyable. Theres even DLCs for a select few trucks such as Scania, Volvo, Mercedes And DAF. (And soon maybe more.) Trailer DLCs for more choices. Theres more to it with Euro Truck Simulator 2! I highly recommend this game!"
11368,"I SAID I HAB SMOLL PP >:(
"
11369,Very relaxing awesome simulator game
11370,Trucks are kinda cool?
11371,"This game is good and chill, enjoy the truck driving life and go sightseeing"
11372,"Euro Truck Simulator 2 is certainly showing its age however, that hasn‚Äôt stopped it from receiving regular updates from a very passionate development team, on top of additional support from the trucking community. This game can be enjoyed by both casual players and car enthusiasts with options to adjust their trucks to the simulation they desire, whether it's performance or cosmetic changes.

Game Objective:

You start off by completing quick jobs with an employer's chosen truck. The further you travel and the more precious the cargo is, the more you‚Äôll get paid. Once you‚Äôve gained enough revenue, you eventually become your own boss of a holding company with the objective of delivering goods throughout Europe, allowing yourself to gain revenue to grow your business, upgrade your truck, and unlock different types of cargo missions by levelling up. By exploring the world, you will also unlock new areas to expand your business, new cities to start your journey in, find new employees to hire, new truck dealers to purchase from, and more.

The World:

It's massive and will only get bigger and better with the additional purchasable DLC map expansions. The base game includes access to Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The DLC map expansions expand on existing countries as well as adding new ones. The developers also tend to revisit the base game and existing DLCs expanding on them free of charge. While some parts of the world look great, it can feel repetitive, bland, and similar at times. However, the weather, the road accidents (both customizable) and the in-game radio tend to keep me distracted.

The Driving:

While I‚Äôm not a car enthusiast, this game provides you with a decent number of options for your simulation needs. The majority of these options will, of course, be more effective for those who have a gaming wheel. This ranges from driver fatigue, traffic offence penalties, transmission types, breaking intensity, suspension stiffness, truck stability options, force feedback, internal friction, and other simulation options to make it more realistic or to ease your driving experience. The more basic features are also included, such as adjusting your seat, mirrors, lights, and truck to your liking.

The Community:

As per usual, the community goes above and beyond for the games they love, and this game is no exception. TruckersMP, as an example (a free unofficial multiplayer mod), expands on what SCS Software has created and makes it better by improving and expanding outside of Europe and even out of trucks. Believe me, there are plenty of mods out there to improve your trucking experience!

Advantages of ETS2:

‚Ä¢ Regular updates.
‚Ä¢ Massive world (even without expansions).
‚Ä¢ Tons of customizable options.
‚Ä¢ Lots of different cargo.
‚Ä¢ The developers revisit the base game and the paid content.
‚Ä¢ Great modding community & modding support from developers.

Disadvantages and much needed improvements of ETS2:

‚Ä¢ Outdated textures (some have been improved on, but don‚Äôt expect AAA graphics).
‚Ä¢ Can feel repetitive with similar environments, bland/flat areas and long roads.
‚Ä¢ Needs more local roads!
‚Ä¢ Bad damage model. No noticeable truck damage and unrealistic collision.
‚Ä¢ Very basic business features.
‚Ä¢ Not really punished for breaking driving rules.
‚Ä¢ No option to customise business building.
‚Ä¢ The United Kingdom is very outdated and needs a ton of improvements (unrecognisable in some areas).
‚Ä¢ More cosmetics and intractable items.

So‚Ä¶ Should I buy it?

The concept as a whole is great and I‚Äôve had a ton of fun playing this game. It can be very relaxing and quite a fun experience especially when playing with others. However, the more I play it the more its age shows itself. This game could be so much better but for that to happen I feel like Euro Truck Simulator 3 would only rectify my issues with the game. I do recommend this game but only when its on sale as its stupidly cheap when on sale. I was originally gifted this by a friend and became quite addicted to it. I even ended up buying a ton of DLCs because of how amazing the concept and the community is! It can however get boring after a while but I find myself coming back every now and again to experience another trucking day :)"
11373,"I cant help but keep coming back to this wonderful game, so good to relax and play at your own pace"
11374,"Euro Truck Simulator 2, even though 10 years old, still gets great updates often. This game might not be for everyone, but it is nice, relaxing, and if you are into these kinds of games (simulator game, no action, calm), it can even be fun. Love putting on a playlist of songs and just doing jobs.

Even if I have had times when I need to do some sorts of drugs to keep me awake while playing it (not that I ever have :v ), I love playing it and like mentioned, the game gets updates often and the updates have been great, even amazing at times, in my opinion."

Listening to the community and making changes the players actually want is what they're doing, and they do it well.

This game is a gem of cozy simulator game, where you can deliver some cargo in mostly any part of Europe (devs do DLCs with new countires, but in my opinion those DLCs totally worth it) and just relax. Good graphics, a lot of mods, devs always bring something new to the game (new trucks, cosmetics, other features etc).

Totaly one of my favourite games."

11490,"Really good game with long relaxing drives, except for when you crash and can't start your truck and you have to repair it because you can't finish your order and you don't have enough money to repair it so you take a loan and then you have to drive even more to get money for the loan. But at least it's relaxing"

11495,"One of the best sim games out there. Certainly my most played simulator.
It's really as relaxing as people say it is. The exploration aspect is great, cause the map is really realistic and captures every countries' roads and feeling. The company building is awesome, you can really put many hours into that one thing alone. The truck customization is great, but you need DLCs (or mods) to really do it. So it could be better. But all in all a solid experience and a time well spent."

11531,"Good game, lots of fun."
11532,"It is what it says that it is, a realistic European trucker simulator. It adds some fun things in like managing your own trucking company. Above all it's a great fun realistic simulator, often offered for a great price in a steam sale.

I also love the ongoing support like the recently overhauled lighting engine and the best addition off all, ONLINE MULTIPLAYER.

Playing with friends really changes the experience, going from a sophisticated simulator to wrecking absolute havoc and chaos upon all the innocent NPC cars that happen to be on the wrong road at the wrong time.

Would recommend!"

11548,"This game did get my vote for the Steam Awards 2021.

Euro Truck Simulator 2 is not a dull simulator that will make you drive around. You can build up your company, take up whatever assignment you want. You can choose or avoid stressy jobs, and basically enjoy a lot of freedom while still having goals - but you're free to set them for yourself. Whether that is to discover the whole map, or build a big women truck driver harem spread through Europe. 

After all this time, the game is still being updated. Once in a few months, I pick it up again for a bit and the small added features and upgrades feel like little surprises that bring a smile to my face. It has gotten more beautiful over time and only for the pleasure of playing a game that still receives so much love, I'd recommend it."

- no seasons
- average and strange behavior of other road users.
- sometimes the streets are empty.
- simplifications in the game

I spent over thousand hours in these Truck Simulators and now I drive truck even in real life. These games did really helped me with driving school and when I finally started out in a real job. 
It's missing the real physics like cab moving and actually feeling it in your chair, but it will teach you how to stay in your line on a road and you'll even learn reversing and parking."

11625,"If you are into your trucks in IRL you will love this game so addictive to me and just such a chill game to play. 

Stock game version however is pretty bland if i am honest. 

Truck customisation is good but lacklustre of actual branded parts like Kelsa bars lights etc. also lots of chrome parts. TOO much if i must say. so get some painted parts via mods.

But there is Tons and tons of mods to make the game 100x better. If your new i highly suggest getting (Promods map) and a traffic mod to make the map experience more enjoyable and more realistic. 

Great game IMO but i would say it requires a couple of mods to make you like it more.

If your not into trucks and driving for hours its not for you."

I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy free-roam and job related games as you get to progress to the highest levels.

Highly recommended to play with a Steering Wheel. I've finally found a use for my Tobii Eye Tracker which I bought years ago. I can now simply turn my head to look out of the windows. Very handy for junctions, looking at your mirrors and tight corners.

11706,"Well, where do I start?
Let me be honest and say that I am a die hard FPS fan with the odd occasional racing sim thrown in.
A friend of mine told me about this sim and to say I mocked him for engaging in a dull, slow moving, driving sim would be an understatement. (In my defence, before he played this, he was raving about some train sim, which he showed me one evening. It was the longest week of my life! Ok hour, but it felt like a week).

Anyway I bought a VR headset and thought, hell, why not try it as there wasn't much else for VR at the time.

I'm a convert!! The base game is a bit small, but still big. I know it sounds a bit odd until you start downloading DLC's too.
 I love this game, it's so relaxing but slightly taxing as well. You get to drive a 40 ton truck across Europe and if you get the extra countries, which you will want to, then it does become a massive area to play in. There are plenty of DLC's and a large modding community. I downloaded ProMods map upgrades which gives you more roads, more towns, more buildings etc and their trailer pack which gives you real company trailers like Tesco, Lidl, Eddie Stobart to name a few. I've also downloaded mods from this site like real fuel station names, improved rain, realistic street lighting.

Playing the game, for me, is with VR. I don't know why anyone would want to play it any other way. VR is so immersive and although it needs optimising as I get a little bit of rubber banding at times and if I look out of the cab there are no wheels and the graphics are not quite a s good. The overall experience is that you really do feel like you are sitting in the cab of a big articulated truck.

You can start as a hired driver trying different trucks and when you have enough money you can buy your own truck, trailers, garage, hire your own drivers if you want. For me the fun is the driving and manoeuvring the truck and trailer.

If you want American trucking then American Truck Sim is exactly the same with its own mods. I own both and I love them both.

Keep on trucking. 10-4

11725,"It's a fine game. Better with a steering wheel, but could play without. Recommended to anyone who appreciates heavy duty transportation."
11726,this is very nice game
11727,"1) the GOOD:
- Driving is nice and smooth

2) the BAD:
- map distances are scaled down, so driving a distance of 100 km with 100 km/hr takes less than 1 hr
- time is also scaled down. The day duration is much less than 24 hrs! Are we on the Moon?
- so, space-time is scaled down to the 1/(x^2). Star-trek style maybe? Warp speed?

3) the WORST
- graphics are the worst point of the game because scenery is not 3-D as expected but all items are 2-D, like paper cartons put in a distance as in a theater.

11757,what a game hours of fun and alot of laughs
11758,"[h1] My honest review on ETS 2 [/h1]

This game is a lot of fun. At first, the game does not seem like it would be that much of a joyride. Looking at it, I believed it would be very boring to just drive around Europe. Oh boy was I wrong. With all that the community has put in, the new DLC (that I need to buy), the customization, and the endless driving opportunities, the game presents itself as fun as many other games on the platform. The game provides an interesting insight into the world of truck driving. There are many different and fun trucks to choose from as well as cool locations/cities to drive through. I have to also thank the developers for the many different graphics options for low - high end PCs. 

Overall, the game is as much fun as other games I have played. I have just recently bought the game but I am ready to spend many more hours on this experience. If you are looking to purchase this game, try sure to purchase it while it is on sale. It has regularly gone on sale during every steam sale and sometimes during weekend sales (when I purchased it). The DLC are also relatively cheap compared to other DLCs of games on the platform. From what I have seen, they contain lots more content to the already expansive base game and are a grand addition to the game. I am very excited to plow many more hours down the drain in this game. :)"
11759,"Very good game, various amounts of trucks and many places to go. You will definitely spend the majority of your life trying to finish this game üòÇ"

11763,"The game provides interesting experience of being truck driver. Lots of possible trucks to choose, many different cargo types with unique attributes (some are very dangerous and require special permit to work with, some require special care due fragility), many different delivery types. ""Special cargo"" for when you need to feel very important and everybody gives you a road =) Many different countries with different languages and differences in road rules. The game is a sibling of American Truck Simulator and provide a little bit different experience."

Every game offers some frustration. Deaths, random headshots, no skill etc. But this game has none of it. It's so smooth and well-done. Only chill and good vibes. One of the best ways to relax."

What an incredible game! I give it a solid 420 horse power out of 1 code brown. I will be playing MUCH more of this!

Also, because I know some people are going to want to know this:

>You do not need a wheel and pedal set to competently play and enjoy this game
>Mouse and Keyboard is fine, a Xbox controller is even better!
>Before buying DLC, make sure you visit each item's dedicated store page before adding them to your cart, doing so will reveal heavily discounted DLC bundles which when combined with a sale dramatically reduce the price of purchase.

Now go download that demo and see what you think!"

11891,k
11892,love this game
11893,"Even tho I just bought the game, I can confidently say that it is one of the most relaxing experiences I've ever played. There's something about driving around Europe with your truck that is so relaxing and peaceful. Especially after playing a game that requires alot of patience and/or knowledge about how the game mechanics work ( for example DCS ). That also goes for games that can get really frustrating after playing them for a while. So in conclusion I give this game a 9/10 ( cause perfection doesn't exist! ). So if this game is again on sale, I highly recommend you buy it."
11894,Nice game
11895,"Such a unforgetable simulatary life of a trucker in beautiful Europe.In fact, U just need a liittle patience to dive into this kind of game.I think it is worth buying ALL DLC because every area has different site and Brand View.
Thanks for reading.For respect  and sincere love."

12006,god
12007,"Okay, so this review is less about the game and more about the devs mentality, I think that their recent destitution to stop the release of Russian DLC just because of the mentality Russia Bad is just downright weird, its like they want the spotlight for the current thing... I like the game and will continue playing it, however it has made me think of DLC Unlockers."
12008,yes
12009,Very realistic simulation the AI drivers drive straight into me just like in real life

12015,wowzers fun game
12016,Euro Truck Simulator 2 is an awsome game. No Doubt! I have become a great fan of this games graphics and the details. Its my first purchase in the steam. Just loved it.
12017,"Because im asian, this game really educates me a lot about the transportation in Europe and many other countries"
12018,Perfect game to listen to podcasts to. Very relaxing. Definitely recommend.
12019,"Very helpful game, but I hope that they'll make it's quality better."
12020,"I was a bit critical of this at first, but I've grown to love this game. It has an RPG-style leveling system to it, but its simulator nature means that there's really no encouraged or otherwise 'correct' way to play the game. I've never been able to say that about an open-world RPG before, and Euro Truck Simulator 2 knocked it out of the park. Also, there are so many options to customize the trucks, trailers, and just the overall experience of the game, and you can unlock more stuff for the first two as you continue to play. It does a good job of meeting players where they are too. I've played a lot of games where driving semi trucks is a thing, and this is one of the best so far. I highly recommend this."

12057,A perfect game for a relaxing. If you play other games which are much maddening and nerve-racking ETS is perfect for take a brake and chill. Especially if you have a steering wheel and pedals (possibly even a shifter too). I bought the game at -70% and I don't regret it.

12075,"Ok, so I've only played this game for 14 hours, but so far, what I have played, is great. The detail in the game is astounding, and the fact that you can listen to your own music, or even tune into some IRL radio stations is epic. Gameplay is very smooth, but then to be honest, I play using a cloud gaming service, so as long as I have a good internet connection, it usually is. Admittedly, the only issues I have are the lack of some serious Grim Reaper art work in the game, but that's probably just me, and the fact that Free Roam is still highly limited to certain roads/motorways/highways and towns/cities.

I am happy enough with this game to consider streaming it over on my Twitch channel, but I am waiting until I get a steering wheel for my PC first (which might be a little while yet, giving me plenty of time to add more hours into it).

To sum it up:
Graphics: 10
Audio: 10
Available Jobs: 10
Free Roam: 9 

Overall, 9/10 from me

12109,Amazing game.
12110,Nice game!
12111,"This is a propper, realistic simulator! Especially given the price...
The details of the trucks are amazing. Driving feels realistic (I recommend using a steeringwheel).
Playing the game is surprisingly relaxing and highly addictive! ;-)
I bought a new laptop so I could play iRacing, but ended up spending most of my time playing ETS2!"
12112,"ups:
-community of players, streamers
-loads of in-game DLC's to custom your gaming environment
-good price/quality ratio. you can always wait for discounts and get the perks you want for cheap prices

downs:
-minimalistic player (Truck driver) customisation
-sometimes you crash in weird scenarios when you get stuck with your truck

I guess, overall it's best for those who like to grind stuff and best way to play is with extra equipment (steering wheels, pedals) because you can experience the surrounding rather then focus on pressing AD buttons all the time :)
Can't wait where this grows to and what will come next !"

12117,"A surprisingly fun game. I tried the demo thinking that it'd be a pretty game with some good driving physics but that I would tire of the game play after a while. I was wrong. After running 5 missions I was hooked and had to buy the game. Driving is only part of this game. The company management and whole business aspect of this game coupled with the upgrading of trucking fleets, garages, and hiring of NPC drivers opens the game up in a way that is comparable to any theme park or railway tycoon management and building game you may of played. Top fun all round!"

12123,its cool
12124,Relaxing
12125,"Great game. Relaxing of an evening after a stressful day of work. Sit down, pick a contract and destination, tune into a European radio station, and just drive around.

Take so many external screen shots, I usually run off the road and crash, or crash into oncoming traffic...interesting that when you crash into a bus none of the passengers have looks of horror on their faces..."
12126,"Yes, it¬¥s great for killing time. I definitely recomend it. But I¬¥m not okay with the fact that I can buy a truck paintjob with REAL money, and I still have to grind in the game to then pay with game money just to get it painted. I¬¥d have that part changed, if someone pays real money for it, they should just get it. But apart from that, I really enjoy the mechanics and the way the game is set up. There are a seleccion of road accidents that make you have to improvise, which puts more pressure on the delivery time, etc. It¬¥s great."
12127,Ton of a fun
12128,you put some chill music on and enjoy the ride :)

12130,"If you like trucks then you might like this game. I personally think this game is good but there is a very big difference between the dlcs. Look at the doc that add the nordic countries. It looks horrible. But look at the new dlcs they look awesome. I think they should go back to the older parts of the map and update it cuz there is a very big difference.

But over all it's a fun game and now we also have native multiplayer mode no more need for truckersmp."

12149,"After playing this game for like 140+ hours, I would highly recommend the game to anyone. The most surprising to me is the graphic support, I can't afford to use that high-end graphic card and wheels, and this game supports my onboard graphic chip on my Intel i5 average laptop under low graphic settings and still looks good.

Also, it is a very relaxing driving game when you can listen to your favorite MP3 while playing the game."

12155,"Worth the price.  Good graphics , detailed trucks , convoy + mod support all makes this game better and better. Almost 10 years old game and still getting good support from the devs. Not money hungry devs like EA. Play using a steering wheel setup."
12156,"Good game

12157,.
12158,excellent game
12159,Would recommend.
12160,"A perfect game for a relaxing time, especially if you have a steering wheel and pedals (possibly even a shifter too). The recent integrated multiplayer update has really upgraded the multiplayer experience as a whole, as you can now more easily play with your friends.

ETS2 is definitely one of my favourite games and I recommend it to anyone looking for something relaxing and fun."

12163,This is the best trucking simulator I have played yet. I have played for several years now. I continue to be impressed with the quality. Some things could be improved but ultimately at the end of the day I am very satisfied! I look forward to more titles in the future!

12168,"this is a really relaxing game. when im stressed out or having a bad day, i boot up ets2 and play some spotify in the background, sometimes i even put on local radio stations just to fit with the theme. the game also has a built in radio but it's pretty confusing to set up."

12178,"If you love lorries (European Trucks) then you will enjoy this game. However, TruckersMp takes ETS2 to the next level. Once you get ETS2 and TruckersMP (a free mp mod) do yourself a favor and drive the Calais - Duisburg road. It will be amazing!

One last thing I forgot to mention, At least it isn't Fornite!"

12183,GG bois
12184,"yes
"
12185,"Great Game! Driving simulation is spot on, but could do with some additions such as being able to walk around the truck and realistic country differences.
"
12186,"A very relaxing and enjoyable experience (I have ADHD and hate driving IRL so this surprised me).

Let me start out by saying that the free demo gives you full access to the base game. If you're curious at all, try it. If you end up enjoying it you can buy the game and continue that same profile with zero progress lost.

There's so much I could say about this game but I'll limit it to this: Turn your suspension sliders, in the gameplay options, all the way to the left for maximum wobble. Turn signals do have an effect on the AI. Every street light has a red light camera that will automatically fine you. Cops are assholes. Quick Jobs lets you try out every truck in the game - with only money loss being from fines you may get.

Just give it a try for a few hours. It does get a better once you have a few drivers under your wing, but overall if you feel it you feel it"
12187,"Very nice game to play with friends, sometimes frustrating but in 90% of cases very chill game."

If I'm ever bored, I can just start the game, listen to some music and chill while I'm driving on while it's raining and dark, or I can turn off the speed limit and enjoy a crazy ride.

Of course this game isn't for everone, but when your really just like to chill, this game is perfect"

I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a chilled gaming experience, but I would recommend playing this game with a controller rather than mouse and keyboard as it is a driving game in the end of the day.

6/10 - Nice and chilled game"

12276,"Euro Truck Simulator has changed my life in many ways in just playing it for 11 hours. 
I would've never have guessed that i would become a greasy truck driver but now that i have seen the
ice cold lifestyle, i just have to respect it. If i fail with my future aspirations, I shall definitely become a trucker
(I am not by any means saying it is a grubby job). If you asked me years ago before turning to teenage years that a game so beautiful and realistic would usher the world of trucking to an adolescent, I would never have believed you. 
Simply put, buy a steering wheel and this masterpiece and you won't have to be a depressed little-idiotic human in these purging times.
P.S please buy a steering wheel because it is a necessity or you will be as good as a person with Tourettes in a 2 minutes silence."

12295,"All I can say about this wonderful game is that Its of course,wonderful XD I still cant forget the nolstalgic moment when I finally hit France for the first time since I have been stuck taking job in the UK in game on my 2nd playthrough.It was nightime when I reach France. The most nolstalgic part is how those lights on the building lit up. Despite seeing France many times in game. By the time I reach France It was the time SCS just reworked the city of Lille. The city is just so surprizing beauiful and the highway is so realistically done that It was just nolstalgic,despite happening only one year ago LMAO. Though there are other nolstalgic moments back then. My final thoughts is that this game is very simple for a simulation,with very little challenge.(Real challenge only happend when trying to park the truck to unload cargo or taking heavy or special transport jobs)Despite that,It is very godamm relaxing,even on 15 FPS(Yes no kidding,I always play on 15FPS yet It is still more relaxing than many games I've played) It is just the best for stressful and depressed people(Judging by quite a few comment,and It really does heal depression) This game overall might be simple,but It is so relaxing and fun that you can forget all the complaints you wanna report to SCS, just admit It :) Although you will get random crash and rewarded a 100% damage with a ticket that cost 100 000 Euros to the repair shop."
12296,amazing but need to let the player get out of the truck add hotels that player can get inside and sleep make it more realistic as a truck driver and what he see on the road and his life

Whether you want to drive alone, or in a Convoy with others, arcade style with a controller or all out with a wheel, shifter and pedals this game will keep giving all the way.  Decent updates and new DLC.  Don't expect everything from day one, you've got to work your way up, but once your past level 25 with a handful of employed drivers you can chill out and splash the cash on custom trucks and trailers, and choose the routes you drive as you wish. ENJOY.!!"

 I played ATS for a year became a millionaire and drove 99.99% of map. Then I tried ETS2. The older basic ETS2 map was not equal to ATS map quality of assets. But the ETS2 map expansions are excellent. I never liked the look of cab over trucks but came to love them and their maneuverability."

Some request/suggestion for the Devs:
(1) Please make the ability to toggle on/off the legend (icons) on World Map. Sometimes it really hard to see unexplored parts that were covered by map icons;
(2) Possibility to get the trucks dirty would be nice;
(3) Visual damage on your truck after crash or collision would be nice."

12489,"6 hours worth and this might be the game I spend playing over the end of year break. Not sure what it is, the chill scenery, the knowledge that if I tried to handle a 12 wheeler in real life that it would start and end badly, the curiosity of the question marks I deviate some trips to go see to find out if its a garage, dealership or hiring firm (or what ever its called). So far I have been playing with speed limiters and speeding penalties (etc) off and have just been treating the roads as if I built them myself and that everyone else on them are there to my reluctance. This game makes me consider buying some peripherals specifically for it, which would be at least five to ten times what I spent on the game (+ some DLC's to unlock additional geographic areas) - I bought this because I was reminded it existed by that horrible English Patriot The Spiffing Brit (I can only hope his patriotism is just a persona for the novelty), but I have seen Limmy (World Famous Glaswegian comedian) play some on his streams (either this or the USA one) and so it's been on the back of my mind out of curiosity for some time. I'm glad it was on special after the reminder.
I agree with other reviews that say this game comes with a type of catharsis and that its oddly satisfying and somewhat unexpectingly a good game... It really casts a shadow on other ""Simulator"" games (not naming names, but you know the ones that become memes because the games a gag).
Other then all this, my brother is looking at becoming a truck driver, so I hope to get him over to play and/or give me tips, despite getting some of my initial joy out of driving like a sporadic psychopath, I find myself being pulled towards the allure of staying in one lane, using my indicators (blinkers), reversing the trailer into place upon delivery for extra EXP, and finding a great deal of satisfaction in these seemingly mundane activities.
Maybe I will try the online play at some point, I found out a friend has the game too so that could be fun... will wait and see. Hope this review helps!"

Price - 10 / 10 - Worth every penny.

1. Most important stuff -[b]trucks, trailers[/b]. Vehicles are detailed and good looking. Also there are many customization options for both trailers and trucks. I was not disappointed despite my very high expectations. 

2. [b]Map[/b] in base game is big enough if you want to play casuallly, once in a while to chill out driving your truck across the europe, but if you want to play more often - I'd reccomend buying one or two (or more?) DLCs with maps and one with some unusual cargo.

3. [b]Multiplayer[/b] is done right. Sessions up to 8 players supporting mods and map extensions inside base game - everything works smoothly and it can be considered.

4. [b]The AI[/b]... well the artificial intelligence might be artificial but I would not call it intelligence.

12618,"I'm not into trucks, I like cars but I was always curious about this game mostly because of the huge maps with different cities and countries. It is a concept that I love, having a base game and then get expansions for different countries.  

All the cities and maps are so well done that it's a real pleasure to drive around with real traffic, weather, etc.
My initial intention was to install car mods and then just drive around freely but to my surprise I found the trucks to be a lot of fun to drive, also the views inside the cabins is superb and doing jobs hooked me up in a way I never thought it would. From time to time I drive a car but it's mostly trucks what I use. I've bought almost every expansion there is (map expansions) and once I have it all I'll probably get the American version too.

I forgot to say I only play the game in VR and for those who really love trucks please do yourselves a favour and get a VR headset because this game in VR is AMAZING, a night-day difference. Fantastic game!"

Decided to give a start a couple weeks ago, now at 35 hours and counting.
Even bought a wheel-controller set for it.
Never knew driving a truck in a game can be therapeutic, relaxing and fun."

12636,"This game is the closest thing to a Euro Trip I can experience in a post-pandemic world. Thank you SCS  Software for making this one of a kind game that makes that both possible and affordable.

I have had this game in my library for years and only decided to try it now while looking for something that offers an open world driving experience and a laid back one at that. After a few sittings, I decided to pick up both the Map Booster and Cargo Pack DLC to expand the game further and open up more exploration and scenic opportunities.

After the tutorial and first few deliveries, the game opens up and adds upgrades, garages, and exploration and transforms into a vast sandbox loaded with opportunities. After buying your first truck and taking on longer missions, all the finer details of the game start to show up in nice and subtle ways. I really like the dynamic weather effects, turn signals, different driving rules and patterns for each country, AI seems to change depending on the location or road patterns... England has terrible drivers that always ram into my trailer in roundabouts or merge into me on the highway on-ramps. Conversely, Netherlands to Luxembourg was one of the smoothest trips ever and the AI is less aggressive. I also play the game with an Xbox 360 Wireless Controller, and when drifting off the side of the road, there is force feedback from the rumble strip at the side of the road, so cool!

One of the best and simplest features in the game is the Internet Radio. You refresh the list and pick from lots of real live internet radio stations and stream any genre of music at any time during your drive. It totally makes for a great driving experience and becomes driving therapy. I like streaming classical music upon arriving the destination and performing the skill parking. Really brings back vibes of landing in a new city on the airplane and the pilot has the classical music and announces the weather and time.

SCS made this game highly configurable and moddable, so almost any gripe can be addressed. I turn off the traffic violations so I don't have to worry about speeding and driving rules and bad AI crashing into me and getting penalized for it. I also turn off fatigue simulation so I don't have to deal with rest stops. Anything to make the drive more relaxing. The cruise control feature is a nice touch. Setting up head tracking with Open Track and your smartphone transforms the entire game into an ultra realistic driving sim with the FOV angle independent of your vehicle controls.

This is such a great game and completely immersive and engrossing. Sometimes while playing, I forget I am driving a big rig and dragging a 40-ft trailer behind me. I only have some minor requests for the devs: 1) offer an auto-drive / auto-pilot mode (similar to RDR2 cinematic cam), because sometimes I just want to camera out and stare at scenery without worrying about crashing, 2) adding a wheel orientation HUD indicator in top-down cam would greatly help the skill parking (right now I constantly switch between top-down and wheel cam in order to back up perfectly straight), 3) add more ambient lighting during night parking (right now, I unhitch the trailer in order to brighten the parking area), 4) allow a zoom out level on the top-down cam so that we can clearly see where the parking space is.

Awesome driving therapy simulator. Highly recommend."

12640,"This game came into my life at a very low point and really helped me go through it. I flip burgers at McDonald's for a living and became really depressed because of it. My wife left me because of the nauseating smell of french fries I constantly had (I don't shower). She left with the kids and married a KFC manager. On top of this, I was playing with my dog and accidently set him on fire which then led to my house burning down. Yeah my life sucks as you can see but this is when I miraculously met a beautiful woman. She was so kind to me made a small doghouse for me to live in. She gave me a crappy laptop that apparently used to belong to her son called Games. When browsing on the internet I found the song called ""Two Trucks Having Sex"" which used to be my favorite song when I was a kid and it also birthed my truck kink. I quickly tried to find a truck game where I could make all my fantasies come true without anyone thinking I'm weird while also being able to afford it and found this game on sale. I also use this game as a coping mechanism to my trauma about the sword war of 84, I roleplay as a UNSC armorer who delivers energy swords. It's definitely my best purchase."

12657,"Enjoyed the game play smoothness, the ability to buy your own trailers, though I feel sometimes  it requires a lot XP to upgrade to the next level as you progress further up in the game. I would recommend upgrading the RAM to at least 6GB and one will be guaranteed a smoother game play. Instructions on how to play or access DLCs added to one's profile would really help. 

Really a cool game! Thumbs up to the developers and the rest of the supporting team."

12666,"The game is very cool and has amazing graphics if your pc can run it, Sadly there isn't a built in feature to play multiplayer but you can always play truckersmp! I recommend this game to drive in a convoy with friends on truckersmp! Have a great one!

Edit**
The game now has a convoy feature that supports up to 8 players wich is more then enough to be able to play with friends. I also tried this game on my new pc wich runs it easily on ultra settings i do recommend the game and i rate it a 8.7/10.

12675,"This is one of those games that surprise you - I thought that I would never be interested in a game about truck driving - and here I am after several years and over 200 hours in-game (and almost the same in American Truck Simulator).

This is a great, relaxing game, and if you invest in a good steering wheel - it's even more revarding. Over the years SCS Software added a lot of new contenct (both a free updates and also as paid DLC's) and the game is still in development.

A wide range of countries, cities and trucks makes it a great game for truck fans and gamers searching for a relaxing title. I usualy listen to podcasts or audiobooks while driving and it works really well."

12685,"I have so much to say about this game.
I started out with a poor performing laptop and did not have any extra accessories like a steering wheel.
I enjoyed the game alot and quickly racked up hundreds of hours. This game is definitely not for everyone. It's very relaxing and can be enjoyed on low-end devices.
ETS2 is priced cheap and has a huge selection of DLC's for both map expansions, cargo & customizing.
There's also a huge modding community in ETS2. With easy access to the steam community workshop or for  example the forum:  forum.scssoft.com.
If you've got an interest in big machines or a passion for trucking, defietely pick up this game and some DLC's to go along with it!

All in all, this game played a part in my inspiration to becoming a truck driver in real life. 
10/10."

12703,"Having gained some moderate enjoyment out of playing ETS2, I couldn't wait to try it out with a VR setup. It seems like a slam-dunk win in this regard: a slow-paced driving game with real immersion, the ability to check mirrors by simply looking instead of having to steer with one hand and try to control the view with the other, that feeling of really sitting high up in the cabin with all those blindspots.

Unfortunately despite claiming to support VR, the game really doesn't. The interface is terrible. I struggled to even get it started (it certainly doesn't play nice with SteamVR). You have to remove the helmet to get through the menus then put it back on again when you're driving. That would be annoying but not a deal-breaker. However it's the poor quality of the graphics engine really get shown up. It's absolutely terrible. The resolution looks like something out of the 90's, I haven't seen anti-aliasing this bad since GTA IV came out on PC and the game just flickers horribly all the time; it's absolutely headache inducing. I spent several hours checking out forums and tweaking settings but nothing came even close to resolving these fundamental problems.

If you're buying this for the standard flatscreen experience then go for it (be aware that you'll then need to spend more for maps and content, which I think is reasonable) as it's a decent game. Note that you'll probably need a steering wheel if you want to use it as anything other than a simple simulator (i.e. automatic gears, etc).

If you're buying it for a VR experience though then stay away. It's the worst game I've played on the headset so far by a long, long margin."
12704,Nice graphics. variety of buildings and roads.  I feel like I can drive trucks already in real life as long as we're going forward.

12706,"Amazing chill game, but at the same time very engaging and addicting."
12707,A wonderful game. I drove trucks for a decade. This game captures the essence of the job and keeps it fun. So many ways to tweak the experience. I don't think I will ever stop playing this game. If you learn to park a trailer in this game you will have a much easier time learning in real life.

12755,"Im writeing this afther 1.43 update.
ETS2 was made on 2012 ,before that they was similar games ,but we get few brands of truck.But is it real truck simulator? 
since 2012 we getting few week or months updates who looks so lame that it diserve negative feedback. 
Reskinig updates mostly change textures and stills dead world.
All map dlc are payble so much without worth any pence,because promods made and progressing much more better then original scs payble dlc,also mostyl maps looks familiar and its easy recognized driving from one country to other.No geographical precision accuracy,mostly feels like same country's maps just changed citie names with different languages.

most trucks are old and not update ,but in real life we have almost few new generation tucks.
This game becomeing dlc buying game "" buy cring dlc to not get bored few weeks till next dlc"". For me ints not keeping game live and atractive players, its like playing with my money and believing that next update i finally got what all payers want so long time ago:

*Real tuck physics ,much better then i can find in internet.
*different carges should be delivered like in real life ,like food delivering in earlyy morning,forestry at nights, 
Gasoline delivering not only from company to company ,but to gas stations *scs believe me it make more live in maps).
ferries should have shedules. Yes it takes time SCS,but i earing money on my job to buy this game,so start work in real progress not michelin or volvo cargo dlc ,because i can get better addons on internet and cargoes then you offer.
Garage:
we can buy as much we earn money in game and whats then?
We have garage,but we dont have mechanic,truck wahers. We have scandinavia dlc ,but we cant buy chains for frosty roads,why ? because physics on this game are same like 2012.
We earing money and it time its lack of place to spend them.Why you cant add more places like spend money in gas station for coffee or energy drinks for example to keep driver drive little bit more not to feel sleepy and drive more distance. 
Buy garage,buy trucks ,hire drivers,they earn money, but they are ghosts. Why ? since 2012 are same. Every scs stream live they mentioning how they proud of this game,but it stuck 10 years ago mostly. We can see npc trucks on roads,but not owned company trucks. Why we dont have live weather like mfs2020. There are free data base what can used for it.Since now all reskined maps have so big fps drop ant its not optimaized. I can play warzone on medium ,but ETS2 fps dropping 70-32fps from cabin view (my pc have 16gb rams)
I damaged truck and no visual? ,No mud ,snow and dusts on trucks  in 2022 game?Simulator? I would like to go and wash my truck and afther dameging not feel that now its my truck slower ""go to repair"" ,but also see that my rear lamps not working or i damaged my mirror in narrow italian roads delivering cargo in early morning.Aslo every time driving and delivering i get experience and what ? i can buy better engine ? Improve my garageand my mechaning should get experience to buy company better engines adn tunning not me. For me let earn my experience not even delivering my cargo ,but also how,like dirving without speeding ,only on green lights in cities ,passing truck and earing exp for buying perks like in Forza horizon where i get exp eveing for pessing truck or car like ""save turn"" ""correct breaking"" and then spend it on perks like, longer driving distance  valueble paintjobs and truck tunning pars or trucks ,finding abbandoned trucks and repairing it. If some of you looks like that im talking like two different game i agree,but its too borring just driving distance of 4 real hours and what then? Next cargo ?WE go conwoy then MPtrucking we already have long time ago.
This is lame and lack of imegination truck simulator that was dead long time ago if not Modders ho keep this game alive with free mod that keeps interesting to play for a while.Thank you all moders who tries improve this game all time.Devs should be shame how greedy they becomeing.

If you want to buy it,buy but none of dlc are worth to buy,better use mods like this.
Promods
DANIELS RANDOM EVENTS
NO ICONS MOD (there is only v1.37 but it perfect works even on 1.43) 
REALISTIC TRUCK PHYSICS 
Realistic Vehicle Lights Mod
REAL COMPAY LOGO Mod
GAS STATION MOD
Real Tyres Mod

          I do not hope that this game become more interesting afther so much small updates whiches are divided to small upates ,thats makes dev showing us that its in progress,its not right.Only progress is making from modders."
12756,This game is fucking great in a way to loose your time and play all day long to get busted with double debt. The amount of money for a repair is extremely huge and it's unreal. I would have to play for 8 hours straight to have my money 0 and then earn more. Fuck this game .I.

12778,"Part of what makes ETS2 so compelling is the fine balance it strikes between being a simulation and being fun and accessible. Not to mention the variety of ways to play, from simply enjoying a road trip to building an empire. ‚ÄúAt the time of release, this combination was quite rare in simulator games."

12782,"Harm's principle states that every individual should only be limited in their ability to harm others, and this game is exactly that limiter that would change those lost sheep and guide them back down the path of Nirvana. To quote, ""Over the body and mind, the individual is sovereign.""

I used to play League of Legends for days on end and would not do anything else but waste my life away on that god forsaken game. I used to be miserable, hateful and toxic, lashing out on my friends and ruining the relationships I had build up  throughout my life. As all my friends walked away from my life one by one due to the way I was treating them, the only thing that stayed a constant was my life spiraling further out of control. In a desperate attempt to save me, my friend tried to introduce me to another game so that I could rehabilitate myself and change myself for the better. 

That game would be Euro Truck Simulator 2.

Initially, I resented my friend for introducing me to this game as I believe that no form of tranquility could ever be discovered from a game that literally does only one thing well; that is, driving trucks. To add on, all i did was drive my truck into other cars, and kept on racking up speeding tickets.

However, truth be told, I had already embarked on a spiritual journey to attain true happiness. 

One job led to another. And another. And another. Then it dawned upon me why I started to enjoy this game.

The sounds, the background, the cities, the roads, the traffic and more. Everything about this game was simply surreal and heartwarming. Brimming with life and joy, this entire game holistically brought out a side of me I never knew I had, or rather, locked away for so long. 

It brought out respect.

Respect towards my family and friends, and most importantly, to myself. No long would I be trapped in a self-deprecating loop of sorrow and misery, and no longer would I bear anger towards others. I had truly begun to live once more. 

To anyone reading this who hasn't gotten Euro Truck Simulator and feel like life is treating you wrongly, please play this game. It changed my life, and it can change yours too.

This game is god's work."

If you can then avoid driving on keyboard and get youreself a game pad with analog sticks or a driving wheel for more fun.
12806,Excellent gaming world!

12831,"What can I say. A game that was revolutionary even 10 years ago, even for its age is one of the best games on the market, constantly updated, improved. Fun alone and now, since the release of convoy, fun with friends. Has the most fantastic modding community you can ever found, ranging from real-life trucks to little interior decorations. Frick it, you can download a BUS and drive it around transporting passages through Europe. There's also a multiplayer mod which a lot of enjoy to play. It is extremely modifiable. The developers are actively listening to their #BestCommunityEver. Always was, is and going to be in my favorites.
I understand that simulators are not everyone's cup of tea, but with these games you come a little closer to understanding of the process that's behind that particular industry. 
10/10. Would love to relive the first time I've played it."

- Brewing up a big cup of tea.
- Booting up ETS2 for some relaxing Zen truck driving.
- Searching for French HotmixRadio 80s on radio.
- Loading up 24t of Milk for 41k ‚Ç¨ from Poland to Romania. approx. 1100 km
- Empty polish road 3 am with Cruise Control on 80 km/h. One hand on the gamepad, one hand on the tea cup.
- A very good song comes up. Turning radio and soundboxes to max volume.

12874,"I'm not normally into simulator type games, however this is one of those gems that you play when you need to just relax and vibe. The music/scenery and smooth driving adds a lofi chill type of feel with lots of customization to your trucks/tons of different trailers meant for different types of hauls and an assortment of different countries to drive in/through.

Someone could ask what is fun for driving truck around european roads. It is combination of great enviroment, very nice visuals, top notch sounds and what more - it is one of the game where you are not forced to hurry up somewhere. Sure, you need to deliver the cargo in given time, but there is plenty of it. 

So, together with it's younger brother - American Truck Simulator - this game is best what the genre could provide - so I could only recommend it!"

12914,Really realistic gameplay
12915,"You drive from A to B, then B to C... Sounds boring as all buggery and why would you want to do this in a game without shooting or constructing a fortress???
Because it's immensely relaxing way to enjoy your music/radio/podcasts, while cruising down motorways in a massive rig! ...Now you can create a convoy to cruise with a few mates!

With just enough rewards to keep you engaged (new trucks, trailers, parts, paint, artwork, new maps, constant updates and mods!). Whether you‚Äôre chasing down that urgent delivery time to maximise that profit, or just viewing famous landmarks and locations, for some great photo ops (graphics are pretty nice and the trucks and trailers look great!!)

Then the sound! You can literally feel the strain (with a 47t load) of the rig when it climbs a steep incline, as you shift down to maintain momentum! Gives me goosebumps every time.

I‚Äôm playing this with an ageing Logitech GT Wheel/Pedals/Shifter and I swear, it feels pretty close to the real thing at times. The recent force-feedback update has made it even more realistic! Great stuff! Great price, you don‚Äôt need to buy everything at once, just the base game is plenty enough to sink your seat into."

You can set up steering wheels with it, or just use a keyboard. There are lots of different trailers you can use, and a very large map to explore. This game has a ton of truck options to purchase, which is a big game changer compared to the american version of this game, where truck options are very limited. This game can be very addicting and fun for anyone who enjoys cruising around in vehicles.

Pros of this game:

- Very large map
- Very realistic
- Full support for steering wheels and pedals
- Lots of customisation for your vehicles

Cons of this game:

- Can get repetitive and boring after a few weeks (I frequently have to take breaks then come back)
- The AI for traffic can be a little bit crazy at times. (They could drive differently in Europe but I know Canadian road laws)
- Too many DLCs to unlock simple things

In conclusion this is a very good game it just needs some minor touch ups. I recommend this to anyone who likes vehicles and simulation."

12962,"A very nice and addictive truck sim. Very easy to learn with a lot of customizations for trucks and trolleys. I downloaded the demo and switch to purchase the game after ten minutes. The more I play, the more I want to play. Even with mouse and keybord the simulation is easy to manage and the challenges doable. My advise is to keep working as a driver until you get very use to drive these beasts before diving into the managerial part."

There is a SteamWorkshop page and Forum Website from SCS filled with mods all free to use

13109,"I think this game is the best driving game ever aside American Truck Simulator. You have endless truck parts, you can install mods (maps, sounds, trucks,truck parts etc) which makes the game super cool. 

You can drive on lots of kilometers of roads, getting from A to B for example from Portugal to Finland takes like 3-4 hours if you don't speed, so that's how we're talking about distances, but if you put mods like Promods, and Rusmap, you can go from Iceland to Moscow or Longyearbyen to Portugal etc, so you get it :) )

The view is breathtaking, even if the engine is old, it can run kindof fairly on a Ryzen 3 2200G with its integrated GPU. Please note that, if you have a 1440p monitor, you will have some lags even at medium, so I'd prefer playing on 1080p. Unfortunately because of the lack of ICs, i can't buy myself a dGPU because it would break the bank."

13112,not a perfect games but its okay
13113,i like it but a need a steering wheel asap lol
13114,"""I would say I was playing 25 hours a day at the peak,"" says self-confessed gaming addict Habibi, now 69. ""I kind of half block it out because I hated school so much but the worst year I can remember was when I was playing Euro Truck Simulator 2. I was 39, and I was getting up at two in the morning and going downstairs on to my mum's laptop to play. I was up until eight, and then I'd get back into bed saying I was ill.""

Habibi's story is not so different from my own; we were both miserable as ""teens"", and we both played truant in the fantasy world of Trucks in Europe. Habibi's attendance fell from 100% in his first year of secondary school to 45% in his last. Mine was less extreme ‚Äì I would miss, on average, a day a week. In both our cases, every day spent off school was a day spent playing video games.

But in the end who the f**k cares and we both d*ed of Ligma. Cuz the truckz were too intense for us.

And more other effects such as the crossing of motorcycles, people and bicycles across the roads within cities.

I didn't know if I wanted to go with the American or Euro, but the European trucks and the larger size of the base game made me pick Euro, and I'm happy I did. Enjoyable, relaxing game. Not too challenging, just you and the road. The optional ""where do you want it"" mini game at the end of each mission makes for an enjoyable little challenge, but once you figure it out it's not too tough to pull off quickly every time."

13252,"This game is always there, you can either be bored, too tired to pay attention, or just want to vibe in your truck and make some money and this game is great. I usually put a chilling playlist on spotify and drive for hours at night. Highly recommended although gets boring if you get serious in it. Also great for watching podcasts or youtube on a second monitor as you drive which gives off a great vibe."

I was trying to read The Man in the High Castle for school but was having issues staying on topic. i pulled up the audio book and launched this game, and wow did that ever help! I was enjoying a fun, easy, and quiet game. it game my brain just enough to engage me to keep me from being distracted completely without drowning out the audio book. 10/10 would do again.

BTW the book is very good, you should read it."

13319,"I like trucks to the point where, as a birthday present, I got to sit in one just driving around. So, giving Euro Truck Sim a go was a no-brainer and, yes, its not only everything I hoped for but it's so, so but more. Why?

In a nutshell, this plays wonderfully in VR (using a Quest 2) and the level of emersion is off the charts and the graphics come to life in a way I never would have expected. I really feel like I'm driving a truck (badly - already I've been done for speeding, I've bumped into a few things). The extent to which the VR experience pulls you into the world verges on the sublime. I am amazed by it.

If you like driving, if you like trucks, and you have VR capabilities I urge you to give this a go. You'll be spellbound. Seriously.

Now you'll have to excuse me, I have a delivery to make."

The trucks are quite different from those in ATS, with the whole right-hand drive and virtually no American models, but this (along with driving on the wrong side of the road (JK) ) give the game a different feel from the other game, but is no less fun. I still have a lot to explore in this game, but look forward to the journey."

This is the best truck driving simulator. The game allows you many customization to your trucks, but unfortunately attaching a bull bar does not provide any additional protection for your truck in the event of a crash. The only benefit of a bull bar here is to install additional lights, and for cosmetic purpose.

Bahasa Indonesia:
Ini adalah simulator mengendarai truk terbaik. Saya suka dengan berbagai modifikasi yang dapat saya lakukan kepada truk saya, namun sayangnya modifikasi bull bar tidak memberikan perlindungan tambahan terhadap truk saya apabila tertabrak. Bulll bar hanya bisa sebagai kosmetik dan tempat memasang lampu saja."

apart from that i really enjoy playing this game, it is very good for someone who wants to become a lorry driver when they're older, like myself. I also think that job sheets would be a good additional thing to be added to the game or a PDA thing that can be used to confirm that you have done the delivery. And also an option to be able to make your own company or work for a company that will give you jobs to do."

13514,"Firstly I'd like to say i'm not one for simulators let alone a one about driving a truck for a living, However I was actually really suprised about this one, It has somewhat great graphics, plenty of landmarks, vehicles etc. It is actually somewhat realistic and by that I mean you will face traffic violations and have to pay a fine. One thing i will say is that it has some hardcore, die-hard fans, even with complete radio stations manned 24-7 so that you can both listen and interact. there is a sense of multiplayer via an external mod. which does allow you to see other folks. 

Its certainly a game you can waste some hours on just driving around doing pretty much nothing, or if you are wanting to build your trucking empire up then go ahead, id recommend it to anyone especially for the price."

13574,If you like trucks i suggest giving this game a shot . I believe it is worth your time. It's better with a gaming steering wheel to be honest
13575,am
13576,yes
13577,this game is just......fantastic
13578,This game is brilliant when you download truckers mp. the mod brings in more realism and its great when you've been driving for an hour and get hit by some random going 30 over the limit. The base game is also great with alot of options for different truck designs along with alot of customisation. driving doesn't get boring and you progress quite quickly. i recommend this game if you like driving games of if you're bored shitless
13579,"Find me a better game to play with friends, I'll wait...."
13580,"If you want to know what it's like to drive a cab of engine tractor trailer and don't want to spend thousands on getting a CDL then look no further. This game offers a hyper realistic experience in truck driving, time management, and navigation. 

For the record, you don't just drive trucks, you are running a business and will eventually be able to hire other people to take cargo for you (you do have to by a truck for them as well). I do recommend to buy a flat bed and an enclosed trailer ASAP, these will open up higher paying jobs.

Overall a great game, just be prepared to shell out a few hours whenever you want to play this, most jobs take at least half an hour, and there are times where it will be very boring, but it is worth the time."
13581,"very good, very realistic, would recommend"
13582,very good game. perfect for my trucking addiction.

Review by CVETKOVIC"
13595,its a fun way to lean to drive its really fun for me at least
13596,"I have always wanted to drive a truck and with this simulation you are able to choose different kinds.  There re also a lot of trailers to choose from.  I love how there are so many options you can make in the game and how you can also customize the trucks.  Furthermore, you can use mods and DLCs to make the game more exciting, challenging, easier, and experiment on many things.  I love how the game is open for mods.  I think I need to upgrade my computer so I can fully use the graphics to make the game visually stunning."

13606,"Virtual Reality Review

Playing this (and ATS) with a VR headset and steering wheel combo is a dream come true. I can't begin to explain the feeling of immersion, or how satisfying this has been. (I think I've put about 30 hours of VR time on the game so far.)

When I put the headset on, I'm in a fully-realized truck cab, parked at a rest stop. I turn the ignition, grip the steering wheel, and my brain believes I'm there. I have a real-life coffee mug on my desk, and a virtual one on my truck's dashboard; more than once I've unconsciously reached for the virtual mug while caught up in driving.

There is a real coziness when VR-driving in the rain. You feel like the cabin is your little sanctuary, keeping you warm and safe from the elements. I wish we were able to get up and move around the cab, because I would park and sit on the bed during a storm.

If there are things that break the immersion for me, they are tiny. Sign posts still are usually hard to read until you're up close to them. And sometimes the dashboard or outlines of your mirrors flicker or bend slightly for a moment (it's not horrendous, and I've gotten used to it enough that I don't notice anymore). Ultimately, the clarity of VR shows you the imperfections in the graphics of the surrounding world, where you might not have noticed it on a monitor. I don't mind this one bit, and I think this version of Europe is charming and beautiful in its own right.

Playing this with the VR + wheel combo has completely soothed my thoughts of quitting my real job to become a truck driver. This scratches that itch perfectly, and it's everything I want it to be."
13607,This is the best trucks game!!!
13608,A very good game for those who are passionate about cars. It's very good for the steering wheel.
13609,"this game has its strengths but when i try to connect my logitech g920 steering wheel it doesnt work so i  cant play on steering wheel and am stuck to keyboard

13696,I lost my wife and kids.
13697,"I wanted to like this game, and it's not bad. The biggest disappointment is that cities and areas all look the same. I was hoping when driving through Europe it would actually at least be mountainous in areas with mountains, or urban with key landmarks in the notable cities. This is not the case. The entire map, even with the newer content, looks painfully repetitive. For the price I got my time, but it could be so much more if it actually brought to life the areas you travel."

Devs are keeping this game interesting with constant content upgrades free and paid and are working together with the community.

The only downside as of now is the not so perfect optimization even with high end machines like mine.
I love using my fanatec rig with a tripple monitor setup, but even an RTX 2080 starts struggling at 7860x1440 in this game despite runnign smooth in BF5 and such on Ultra settings.

13897,"Really good simulator of trucks just for real truckers! The thing that you can create your own business and make it grown is pretty cool. I've never been a fan of simulator games, but I gave it a try to this game and OMG, what a game to invest time in. Very detailed game, with a lot of references you can find during your travel. You can also play multiplayer with your friends doing convoys, what I really enjoy it! If something to say negative is that there's nothing, almost perfect if it wasn't for bugs (All games have those).
Simulation rating: (10/10).

Have you ever dreamed of driving a big truck, but all the training and licenses and drug tests prevented you from living out that dream? Well now with ETS2 that's no longer a problem. Tear white-hot ass across Europe leaving death and destruction in your wake. Exploit the labor of your employees and build a trucking empire the size of which the world has never seen. ETS2 teaches you basic economics, as well as how to drive a truck, for one reasonable price."

The developers are great. The modders are great. The online community is great.

Since lockdowns were in place due to the global pandemic, this has been by way of going out and exploring the outside world safely (unless you encounter drivers who think that this is a game of bumper cars... or trucks). Take the scenic routes, they're worth it!"

14042,"Game itself does perfectly what it's supposed to do. It's relaxing to just put on some music and get on the road after spending time in multiplayer fps games filled with toxics. Although be prepared to spend money on dlcs because without those you don't get the full experience from playing.
But I'm giving a negative review for one thing.
This game after all has a developed community with people being pretty active and devs doing events to connect with the playerbase.
I've noticed huge amounts of censoring people that disagree with devs and devs themselves being very politically correct. Me and many other people were silently censored (deleting comments) only because we didn't agree with latest annoucement. Doesn't matter that we gave constructive negative opinion in a politely manner without insulting anyone. This looks exactly like China - you don't agree with us - we censor you.
I believe in full freedom of speech and if I knew that devs promote censorship I'd never buy this game."

It turned out that this was actually a really good choice because I've found this game to be very relaxing. Some might also say it is boring to just move cargo from one place to another, but... well maybe it is? Boredom is what I sought in that particular moment in time, and I got it.

I can't say how ""accurate"" the roads are since I've not traveled around Europe, but... if it is anything like the American version of this game, then it is probably quite good. :D"

14071,"A trucking simulator game seemed more like a job or time-wasting endeavor than anything legitimately fun. I downloaded the Windows demo mostly as a joke, to see what sort of nonsense gets rated highly positive. If nothing else, I could spend an hour causing chaos across the EU and move on to the next game on Steam. I ended up driving from Prague to the northern part of the UK In a single sitting. I never made a delivery but loved the drive.

I saw this title as being Linux compatible so I figured I'd pick it up to ensure this account had access to the bulk of Steam's features that are locked behind a purchase wall. Despite this Linux laptop being a bit of an old dog with only 4 GB RAM and integrated Intel graphics, it ran smoothly. THe occasional graphical hiccup emerged as detail was raised above low, but it performed perfectly well at low settings. There's a load of radio stations to choose from and if you opt to go online, you can join a server and talk to other players via the CB radio feature. If you want to remain offline, the single player experience is perfectly fun. Adding mods and multiplayer extends the experience and replay value considerably.

The gameplay is multi-faceted, including a business management portion, the actual driving simulator portion where you do missions, and the potential for a more free roam or sandbox style of play. Controlling the vehicle with a full-featured wheel/peddle/shifter setup is ideal, but the game controls acceptably well with a gamepad, keyboard, or even mouse steering. 

This title offeers a stronger community base and game mechanics for roleplaying than many MMO titles do nowadays, despite being a trucker simulation. Sure -- you can't be a wizard here -- but you also can't be a trucker in Black Desert Online.

Top tier gameplay, top tier community, top tier mods, top tier UI, and top tier Linux compatibility."

14119,"The game is good, is relaxing, there are some very stunning scenes. It has some issues though, nothing major, AI cars tend to crash into you, some toll booths don‚Äôt work, map discovery is highly inconsistent (some overpasses/interchanges get discovered as a whole and others you have to drive through each centimeter), that sort of thing.
The big, major, unforgivable problem is the developer‚Äôs attitude, when you encounter a problem or an error, you‚Äôll be shot down, there‚Äôs never anything wrong, there‚Äôs never an issue, it‚Äôs always the user error, or Steam problems. It‚Äôs a very unhealthy attitude and has happened to me every time i had an issue. They will go as far as locking threads discussing issues to avoid taking responsability or any kind of action to help you. Their level of disregard is only comparable to those of EA and Ubisoft.

If i'd knew it was like this, i'd have never bought something from them, truly awful experience.

UPDATE: They will go as far as to delete comments and issue warnings if you dare to post anything other than ""the best developer ever"" in their forums on Steam. At least Ubisoft ignores you, but they won't try to bully you into posting positive feedback. Worst developer EVER."

I'm no truck driver (outside of maybe driving a de-ice truck), and I have never been to Europe before, but I must say, this game really impressed me to the point where I feel like I'm really there and driving a real truck. I am positively impressed."

14160,"This game is very interesting with many challenges to be accomplished. Beautiful scenes and road challenges. The only thing that bothers is that you do not have much choice with recruitment of drivers as it is limited. So even if you discover many recruitment agencies you still cannot have drivers for your garages and trucks. I would also recommend to introduce recharging your tele tickets at tolls as it is part of drivers income. I enjoy playing it and discovering new places and definitely completing the challenges given, Enjoy your ride!"

14169,"This game saved my life.

I am 69.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

14211,great game with much R rated content
14212,"This is one of those games that surprise you - I thought that I would never be interested in a game about truck driving - and here I am after several years and over 200 hours in-game (and almost the same in American Truck Simulator). 

This is a great, relaxing game, and if you invest in a good steering wheel - it's even more revarding. Over the years SCS Software added a lot of new contenct (both a free updates and also as paid DLC's) and the game is still in development. 

A wide range of countries, cities and trucks makes it a great game for truck fans and gamers searching for a relaxing title. I usualy listen to podcasts or audiobooks while driving and it works really well."

14256,It made me a person who interested in trucks a lot and I am very happy with that.
14257,if you like the trucking scene you will mostly like this game you can make it as big and small as you can lots of customising options and i think they are working on the VR option as well which i think this game is made for. so for all you transport and trucking maniacs out there this is a game you should try. sadly the scenary leaves a  little more to be desired for but nothing mayor.
14258,GOOD EXPERIENCE
14259,good game
14260,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories

14298,Love this game. Only Doug's raspy voice in my GPS can tell me what to do with my life.
14299,"One of the best games! Although it's not really simulation, as time passes faster inside the game, all situations are taken from reality. Maybe it's the game I played the most. By this time I have more than 600 hours of playing, but I've lost previous record due to some machine issues, so I had to build all those hours and map exploration again.
Because of this game I felt that stay at home during the pandemic was something I could take with ease. Seeing traffic, buildings, new landscapes and so on gave me some feeling that I wasn't stuck at home all the time.
So, if you are a Sim-gamer, it's a must to have it.
If you're not, it's a must to try. At least, after some hours of playing, you'll see that guiding those machines is not that easy and drivers deserve some respect for their work."

But that's the charm and what i love about the game, it's accurate and is an excellent simulator of a trucking job.
Traffic violations and real world scenarios all trying to sabotage your journey of that clean drive and big paycheck. 
Realistic turning is hilarious sometimes, the amount of times I've sped round a corner just to fall on my side and destroy my truck. XD
I love to sit back, put the radio on and just let time fly while i drive casually down the open road.
If you want to just chill... Get this game, put your favourite songs in the games radio folder and sit back and listen while you deliver goods around the country.

14390,"If you like driving sims and truck driving in particular, look no further than ETS2 and ATS. The AI can be frustrating at times but overall it's an absolute blast to get on and drive trucks around the EU and Western US. The maps and scenery are wonderfully done. There a lot of different truck types and trailers available. There is also a huge variety in load types to carry.  9/10, 4.5/5 stars, two thumbs all the way up. Keep up the good work and keep the content coming SCS team."

14401,I really like Euro Truck Simulator 2 because It's really realistic and chill to play. I recommend this game.
14402,Very chill game but kinda boring in the start : /

14407,Broom Broom - Charlie XCX: The game
14408,"Technicaly nearly identical to American Truck Simulator, but in a European setting. Covers most of Europe as of now. Not just for truck nerds. Can be modded extensively. Graphics somewhat obsolete, but the game works well. You can build your own company, and listen to real-world radio stations while driving. Development is still active with DLCs coming galore. This and ATS are [i]the[/i] trucking games."
14409,"great trucks , lots of location s to choose great grafifics engine sound pretty real ,"
14410,"If you like simulators and especially driving trucks on a steering wheel, is awesome !"
14411,it is fun and relaxing. Good graphics as well/
14412,"Unless you are a trucker or otherwise obsessed with trucks then I cannot understand why anyone would enjoy this game. The graphics are horrific, feels like a cheap game from 20years ago. The jobs are dull and repetitive. Any enjoyment from gaining xp and levelling up etc is nothing compared to the enjoyment you can get from levelling up in other games. Maybe it's more fun if you pay a fortune for a full driver controller setup, but if you are going to do that then there is a world of racing games that blow this game out of the water.

One of the most boring games I have ever played. i just don't get why this is such a popular franchise in this day and age. I can only think that the people that play this game are not really ""gamers"" but trucking enthusiasts with no real clue of how good games can be these days. Fair enough if you like it you like it, but I just don't get why."
14413,D
14414,"This game is perfect for when you want something continuous and simple with a lot of soothing spare-time included. Fetching a trailer in northern UK and transport it to southern Germany, realizing half-way that everyone except you drive on the right-hand side of the road (oops) and having to reverse around a tight corner in order for the AI cars not to hit you... It is actually kinda exciting!

The best part about the game is that there is no real rush in it; Get in, do what you declare to do, reap a small reward (although it gets more fun when you get a really tight reverse parking spot to manage).

The only particular downer would be that the Linux-binary of the game does not support VR, which I was really hoping that it would. Oh well, still a couple of hours left until I get close to the 60%-map counter. Better get truckin'!"
14415,Quite relaxing and yet challenging if you want. The choice is yours.
14416,Best game
14417,truck go brrr
14418,"Get over your snobbery and give it a spin ;)  - it's an impressive chill-out driving game.
Huge map, especially with the DLCs. Looks good, sounds great too.
Multiplayer via ""Convoy"" in the default game, is an interesting and easy way to meet others.
Great with TrackIR too!"

14425,A game I first played years ago when it was first released you come back to it after years of owning and go WOW you can see how far it has come. Id say out of most game studios these guys are the most deserving of all their money you can feel its a true passion project from start to finish
14426,very good game would recommend
14427,Podcast & trucks = ultimate chill
14428,i think its the one of best games for driving a truck but one minus is that a lot of dlc that are overpriced

14536,"If you are looking for a more relaxing driving game that isn't a racing game, this one is it.  It's a great game if you don't have a pc that can't run games that are more intense in terms of graphics.  The graphics are great in ETS2.  A quick note, if you plan on using a steering wheel, one with 900 or more degrees of rotation is much better, 270 degrees is way too touchy.  I've been using a Logitech Driving Force GT with no issues."

14578,"out of the plethora of vehicle based simulators out there with wildly varying levels of quality (usually leaning towards the lower end) ets2 is, by far, the BEST one. 
it does what it sets out to do wonderfully and has a very supportive and active dev team constantly working on new updates and features for it and its sister game american truck simulator (which is equally as good). As well as this there are countless community made mods to enhance your experience, and the new convoy multiplayer is a great feature - driving with friends is a lot of fun.

if you are interested in driving games then i highly recommend checking this out - especially if you're looking for a more laid back experience"

Maybe I had a lot of expectations but I thought you get to see some landmarks of cities or to see a significant improvement of this game during these last 15 years. It is not the case.
If you like to drive kind of aimlessly and listen to radio, this game might suit you though."

14792,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

14808,"Thankful for this game , want to create more"
14809,"Awesome! In these Covid days, a little e-tourism behind the wheel of a big rig is wonderful.
The graphics are brilliant. However, you need a decent machine to read the speed signs before you pass them, and that cop sitting on your bumper will fine you the instant you do... also the Russian roads are designed to farm speeding fines off you... I ended up getting a bunch of fans pointing at my Geforce 970M lappy, and that cooled it off enough to be workable.
It's too easy to make money. Once you can afford your first truck, you just rake it in, currently I'm getting 500k+ a day. 
Don't turn down the graphics to remove stuttering in southern Italy, it's CPU dependent.
I've played 800 hours in the last 3 months, enough said"

14846,"Sounds like the most boring premise in the world, right? I mean, who wants to spend hour after hour trundling along at the 55-60mph mark watching the motorway service stations go by?  Then I played it, and discovered that it's the digital version of crack cocaine. Like most junkies, I can't even tell you *why* it's so good.  Perhaps it's the cathartic effect of a growling engine and a swaying cab. Perhaps it's the attention to roadside detail that quickly becomes apparent in a way that no screenshots can ever do justice to.  Perhaps it's the satisfaction of slowly building up your own trucking empire.

All I know for certain, is that *this* is the game I originally bought a PC specifically to play.

Verdict - ""Who knew trucks were so fun""/10"
14847,"Good and fun!!!
"
14848,"Absolutely a great game. It keeps getting better and bigger with every DLC and free updates. Just that kind of game where you just sit, put on some music and relax. Don't use you phone or drink though. can't mix those with driving!"
14849,"I still don't know why I like this game.

I am a gamer started gaming back at 2000s, it was half life and CS 1.3, along with Starcraft and Diablo2 later on. Until today, I have been playing Arpg, mmorpg, RTS, FPS, TPS, sword & magic, survival, flight simulation, GTA that start from vice city to 5.

I have been play long enough to know my own taste, what kind of game I like, and when approaching to a new genre, I can tell why I like that game, with reasons listed out like 1234.

Then recently I bought this euro truck 2 on sale, cause I heard this game before but now I am bored and go no other game around to play, so now I gave it a try since this game got overwhelmingly positive, there's not much overwhelmingly positive game on steam, so I gave it a try.

And until now, I still don't know why I like it, yes I like this game and love to drive truck in the game, but I have no way to find it why its fun. The delivery satisfaction like death stranding? no, a bit but not that much, all I have when I send the trailer to the destination is a moment of relax, not much satisfaction.

the business simulation? it wasn't that in depth and with much details, you got money you invest and your employee start working for you, and life goes on, that's it. It is simpler than the other business or tycoon game that need a lot of management.

So its that driving? the driving part make me feel satisfied? from running on a highway that with no aliens and no enemy trying to shoot your truck, just simple driving, but why is it satisfied? 

I am going to drive more in this game and see if I can figure out what is the really fun in this game."

I had fun learning all the technical stuff about driving a truck. I don't drive, but this is a good simulator as i felt proper scares when i got tired on the road. mad people drive tired and they are also sociopath, think about the other drivers, yourself, your cargo, your job, and the hospital, cops, fines ! 

It's a loop about delivery and exploring the countries you cross, with great dexterity you can deliver in time and in one piece (no domage) your cargo hundreds of kilometres across sea from south to north or west to east of Europe.

Beautyfull mods and community made the multiplayer and pimping truck possible ! great game much love."

14996,Great game to learn how to drive a truck and how to navigate
14997,"At first glance, Euro Truck Simulator 2 seems to fall right into this category of miserable simulator games. It is a game where you drive a truck around the European continent - from city to city, on a huge network of highways and country roads. Along the way, try to keep to the traffic rules, avoid crashing into other cars, refuelling and paying tolls on a regular basis, and if the trip is extra-long, take a short break in a parking lot somewhere to sleep.
It probably does not sound very fun. And considering the kind of rubbish we find in this genre, it's no wonder you judge it down and home at first glance. But as I have said before: What games are about is really irrelevant, it is what the developers make it that counts. It's fine to make good entertainment based on basically boring themes. And Euro Truck Simulator 2 is, in fact, a pretty good game.
Euro Truck Simulator 2 is ultimately about making money. When you start the game, you are a truck driver without either a car or money, but by taking jobs for various transport companies, you gradually build up your bank account. When you have earned enough, you can drop by one of the many car dealers in the game, and buy your own donation, which you can then use to make more money. Then you can hire new drivers and buy new cars, and build your own little transport empire.
The game has both licensed trucks, from manufacturers such as Scania and Renault, and fairly obvious counterfeits of cars the developers have not been given the rights to use - for example DAF, which has now given its consent to inclusion in the game , and will come in a free update . The cars you have bought can be further improved, and there are a number of types of accessories that you can buy. A lot of it is purely visual, but you can also upgrade the engine and so on."
14998,"I am big fan I have being playing ETS 1, trucks and trailers, i believe it was the name of it, and now, and when I say now i mean since 2014 I have being playing ETS2, the game has come a long way since its release and congrats to all production of the game and for all the updates release up to date love it before and love it now, thanks for countless hours that i have spent playing this game"
14999,good game
15000,"
The game is perfect, it's a real pleasure to play it. I would like some DLC covering the Balkans in the future (Serbia, Croatia, etc.)
Please insert all four seasons (snow, icy roads, snowy roads, mud, etc.) and real damage to trucks, trailers and cars after a collision, dirt on trucks and trailers.

Thanks for everything and just keep it up

You're the best!!"

15017,"My friend told me about this game , i was like it`s not for me it looks boring , but it`s actually really relaxing and fun .

Playing truckers MP with my friends , driving from A to B listening to the live in-game radio with traffic updates .

Wheel and pedals is a must , im currently using logitech g923 with shifter."

15023,This game is good but I would recommend a steering wheel to play still good tho with keyboard and mouse but a steering wheel makes it way better so If you really into this game I would invest into a steering wheel. Hopefully this helped!

15031,Love it!
15032,Bought the game to play in VR and have to say it‚Äôs my most played VR game out of all the others it‚Äôs a great way to chill driving whilst listening to the radio I have purchased all the maps to the game and it‚Äôs great driving around Europe and discovering cities and landmarks and also using mods also brings more realism to the game definitely worth getting 10/10.

15057,"To enjoy simulator games, you must make sure that you are patient enough at first. Although you can indeed enjoy the casual time in simulation, you might unavoidably spend a lot of time to acquaint yourself with the complicated operations at the very beginning.
But as a simulator game, it is good enough. I won't give the nice game an inverted thumb just because of some extremely personal preferences.
If you are passionate about the simulators, then just go for it."

15070,amazing game could spend hours and hours on it
15071,"From my very first experience of this title over at a friend's house, to all those long hours behind the wheel, ETS2 has lost none of its charm. When I initially heard about it, and listened to what people who truly adored it had to say about it, I really didn't know how it could be possible that something seemingly so mundane could have the appeal they claimed it did. It didn't take me long to realise how right they were.

Obviously, sims like this aren't everyone's cup of tea, but for the people who are drawn to these types of titles (you know who you are!) ETS2 is - in my opinion - one of the best. Its current review status of 'overwhelmingly positive' speaks for itself, and the number of VTCs (virtual trucking companies) that exist via the TruckersMP mod adds another dimension and potential for interaction. The sheer scope for customisation in terms of the trucks in the game is vast, and the available DLC opens up even more for you to play with. 

And let's not forget how damn relaxing it is to just jump into the cab and wind your way through a simulated Europe, shipping things where they need to go. It might not be a hack 'n' slash, an FPS or an action RPG, but the kind of fun to be had from games like these does seem to scratch a certain itch."

15085,"It was better to involve with daily life details such as getting off the truck and refuelling going to the restaurant or bars to grab something.
Before we could hear the sound of thunder inside cab but now impossible and engine noise is very bad.

Mm, yeah
Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here, and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
Well, I wanna drive it all night long
Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood, and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road, and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down and back up again
You're in my blood
I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
The road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

There was a distance between you and I (Between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye, ooh, yeah
There ain't no load that I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors
Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long (All night long, yeah)
If you're going my way
Well, I wanna drive it all night long

15214,"Trully a great simulator, relaxing and really fun if you are into simulation games."
15215,"The official multiplayer its good but please add LAN Support or dedicated server tool for Convoy mode, because when steam is down (like today) we can't use this feature, every other aspect of the game its really good."
15216,I was told this was a nice soothing game to chill with. Sadly not my experience. Severe lack of a tutorial makes the parking section a nightmare. Far too hard to get to grips with. A proper area to practice in would have been useful. Simpy frustrating. Uninstalled.

15324,BEST ROAD AND TRUCK SIM GAME EVER ...... and now i think it is only thing make that can make me relax
15325,"I was very disappointed that i couldn't kill any prostitutes. Although, I was very hooked on the idea of getting the best truck and becoming the best truck driver to ever touch England. I started in Manchester and made way down to London. This drive was fantastic. I was able to see all the sites like the M1. Anyways after London I had a good amount of wonga to spend. So, I bought myself an Iveco Truck. This baby was called Flenck and could go from 0-60 in 8;14;48. She was could get me to anywhere in the world. Paris to be exact. This was the job of a lifetime. I was finally gonna get my big break ¬£28,942. Couldn't believe it. This was gonna set me and Flenck up for life, but then I sold Flenck for another a beautiful Mercedes. She was Slim but curvy in all the right places. Her exhaust was so silent and barely made a whisper even when I plowed that baby from Plymouth to London at a coooooool 58 mph. took me the good half of 10 minutes. was a delivery of tyres worth a whopping ¬£70, when I got to London (the second time) Me and missy (the merc) saw another truck, an Iveco. It was Flenck. She was being driven by another person. I was amazed and disappointed I didn't know what to think, but in a moment of genius I realised what had to be done. I had to kill Derek Ingleburt my arch nemesis driver, he undercut all my prices and he was driving a VolksWagon next to Flenck. I knew then that he had to die. This was outrages. He would go to London from Rome to Hamburg for ¬£4.20 where as any self respecting driver would do it for ¬£50,000. I'm suprised he's still in business and that he can eat. So I followed him to Flabba and beat him to death with a spiky hamster that was on fire. (quick detour: hamsters are from Israel originally). After that i had to hide the body. I did this by parking Missy in a Toys'R'us and parking her in top of Derek Ingleburt with a gun on Derek making it look lie a murder/suicide. Anyways, enough about me. Loved the game. Love trucks very realistic!"

15559,"When you think about open world games, your mind tends to leap to Assassin's Creed, Grand Theft Auto, and all the other big hitters of the genre. But you might be surprised to learn that one of the best, biggest, most varied, and constantly evolving open worlds doesn't belong to a blockbuster third-person action game with a mega-budget; it's the setting for Euro Truck Simulator 2."

I usually lose interest in a game after a hundred or so hours when playing a game. I am now at 260 hours and now I am wanting to buy a wheel controller set just because of this game. Superb.

15593,"Euro Truck Simulator 2 is an open world truck simulator game developed and published by SCS Software for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS and was initially released as open development on 19 October 2012.[1] The game is a direct sequel to the 2008 game Euro Truck Simulator and it is the second video game in the Truck Simulator series. The basic premise of the game is that the player can drive one of a choice of articulated trucks across a condensed depiction of Europe, picking up cargo from various locations and delivering it. As the game progresses, it is possible for the player to buy more vehicles and depots, as well as hire other drivers to work for them. The game has never-ending play style.Gameplay follows an open world style, with players being essentially free to travel anywhere in their lorries, provided they can keep up with fuel, maintenance and toll costs, alongside fines if they incur any. When starting out, players choose their HQ's location in any of the game map's cities. At first, the player can only take what is known as quick jobs‚Äîthese jobs involve making hired driver deliveries while employed by a delivery company, with a provided truck and all expenses (fuel, road tolls, ferry crossings) covered. As the player earns money or takes bank loans, they can eventually afford to buy themselves a truck, acquire a home garage, and start accepting better-paying jobs by using their own truck instead of being a driver for hire with gear being supplied. Money earned in the game can be spent on upgrading or purchasing new trucks, hiring NPC drivers to take on deliveries, buying more garages and expanding the home garage to accommodate more trucks and drivers. The skills of the drivers hired by the player also grow with experience and the player can create a huge fleet of the trucks and drivers expanding the business across Europe.

As players progress and earn money, they are also able to purchase their own trailers, which can be fully customized in the same way as trucks. Player-owned trailers can be used to receive and deliver cargo at existing storage locations. Like trucks, trailers can also be allocated to company employees, resulting in higher income.

The player gains experience points after each delivery. A skill point is awarded after each level-up. Skill points can be used to unlock deliveries that require different ADR classes, longer distance deliveries, special cargo loads, fragile cargo loads, deliveries that are urgent and eco-driving. This progression allows the player to take on better-paying jobs.

The base game features 71 cities in twelve countries, over twenty types of cargo and over fifteen fictional European companies. There are seven map DLCs that expand the game to more countries and locations, and multiple other truck and trailer DLCs."

15648,"Do i recomend it - Kind of yes? but not really anymore (buy a bundle at 70%discount) its not worth the full game price, and dlc map prices.
 If you LOVE flat Truck games to go from point A to B and thats all, then this game is for you.

You got base driving, the same driving like it was in the base game in 2012 ! soon 10YRS
all dlc have improve in quality of the map, from first oldest dlc to newest.. there was an graphic overhaul of trucks, 

But

For a long time now there were few trucks added (in very good quality) you have 18 models of truck for today in 7 manufacturers. There are few facelift version in this....
The system is old as hell, the engine of the game is obsolete for todays quality (chopped roads, low poly figures and everything beside the truck is like from 2010), and the campain is flat as hell close to non existing.. There is no suriving element in managing your company.
Company. that you can run is just a money making cheat, and the road Ai is worse than in cyberpunk xD

Yeah, on VR game is ok, but after ~400h on torrent edition, then i wanted to play MPtruckers so i bought the game and DLC at this time and VR came in to play i managed do another ~160h. and now if i run this game i got an instant exit spasm. So last dlc i bought was Iberia that i played maybe 2h... 

No more dlc for me... for you? decide by yourself. 
I wont pay their bills only for a new map, and no other improvements, or if the stories are true for DLC with trucks...

I would give a Meh ratting, but there is none, and i cant give Yes. 

Przepraszam SCS,ale walicie po prostu w Wacka i lecicie juz na nostalgi i hard fanach.

"
15649,Its ok
15650,FKN SUPERB
15651,"Maybe one of the best Trucking game I've played since now.
I always enjoy the rides from A to B, and gotta admit is satisfying seeing that Excellent after every safe and in-time jobs :D

Now about the game itself.
Looking at the first ETS and this one, you can already see they done a Good work. Devs are still bringing cool updates, at least lately they done a really nice job on the Sounds, Lighting, also finally including multiplayer to it is a really nice improvement.
The graphics are pretty good for what it ask for, but i would recommend a medium to high setup to enjoy it at a higher level of detail.
The physics are pretty good too, the wheels grip good on the road, so you should be careful how fast you take the corners, don't end up on the side of the truck :D
It has support for steering wheels and controllers, I don't have a certain list of the supported ones but I guess you could find one on the Internet, or you could just opt in for Mouse Steering in case you don't have a controller or a steering wheel, which I do love because I've rarely seen a game that has such a good Mouse Steering.
About it's content, they got Licensed Trucks, Scania, MAN, DAF, Iveco, Volvo, Renault, not all the models, but we got a few Old gens and also from the New Generations, which you can pretty much customize as you like, chose what ever color you want, there are some paintjobs also, change the cabin, chassis, engine, transmission, gearbox, slam some new rims along with some better tires, put on some lights, do what ever your heart wants. Don't forget, this game also has Workshop compatibility so, content, you have plenty of it.

And that's pretty much all i had to say about it, the price is all worth it, but I would recommend a sale for it, specially for DLCs since for me at least are a bit expensive some of them."

But without it on keyboard from my experience, I've been thoroughly enjoying it. The economy is very well tuned. I like the tickets mechanic, cause if you're not speeding much they usually don't bother you from my experience (except cameras). You can take loans to get your company started, earn money through hiring drivers and their own truck to use, take freight shipments with your own truck for more money. I would say early on to stick to doing quick jobs because if you damage the truck, your employer will pay for damages and etc. (56k one time... oopsies, I'm an Asparagus ;> )  But yeah, gonna be playing this for a while. Remember to train yourself early on to back in because experience matters a lot. You never know when you might need to back out of somewhere!"

15783,"The game is awesome! And I can talk a lot, because you should buy it, it is the game which you want, if wanna play such games, just because there no such detalized and huge game, as Euro Truck or American. so just buy it)

And there is the letter to the owners, I dont know mb you dont have so many people to promote the game, mb anything else... but read it, pilease we are custumers and we want something new and often it is related to trucks, make more cabine accelerators, tuning, if you want just go to the work shop, download and put these things to the game. I dont know how these guys make all these stuff, but why dont. 

You are the best. And becouse you should increase. We want more things in this game) 

Thank you!

15808,very good gam
15809,"Euro truck est un bon jeu. Ce qu'il promet est respect√©, malgr√© √ßa je vois plusieurs points noirs au jeu.

Premi√®rement, la carte est tr√®s bien garnie, cependant, je trouve que payer un DLC pour acheter une portion de territoire est ridicule, c'est du contenu qui devrait √™tre pr√©sent de base.

Deuxi√®mement, les collisions ne sont pas parfaites, je me suis retrouv√© coinc√© √† plusieurs reprises √† cause d'une pauvre pancarte, ce qui nuit au r√©alisme et √† la fluidit√© du jeu. De plus, le tutoriel du jeu est selon moi pas assez explicatif, beaucoup de m√©caniques importantes ne sont pas abord√©es et c'est plut√¥t difficile de s'amuser sur le jeu au d√©but.

Pour conclure, Euro Truck Simulator est un excellent jeu de camion et est l'un des meilleurs dans sa cat√©gorie. Malgr√© son age, il reste amusant √† jouer seul ou entre amis. Le prix de 22$ est justifi√©, mais personnellement j'ai attendu un rabais pour celui-ci.
Merci d'avoir lu.

16008,"my first driving experience

i start in london
i get on the road
i immediately think ""wait why is everyone on the wrong side of the road""
turns out it was i
so i broke several more laws and got onto the correct side of the road
got stuck because i can't drive in video games
i get towed
i leave where i was dropped off, real close to where i needed to be
i GO BACK ONTO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD [i]AGAIN[/i]
i proceed to drive on the sidewalk
got stuck again
drove myself out of where i got stuck
drove onto the wrong side of the road yet again
get back into my lane
pull into client's parking lot
decided at this point, backing up into the spot would be a terrible idea
picked the easy parking spot
drove there, no biggie
i did it"

16018,"The best way to chill and relax while exploring new places and different world.
The new contents seem always exciting and SCS has been really dedicated for developing and improving the game through the years for nearly a decade now.
It is obvious a hard work is being done and there is very close attention paid to fine details.
In my opinion the main things this game needs to improve is anew user interface for the game, graphics improvement for the environment generally,  the sound configuration is done pretty well and I think it has been optimised to some extent even for 5.1 channel system so well.
Definitely would love to see more challenges, career mode with progress percent would be nice to have sense of achievement, but anyways overall the game is more than fun and enjoy to play.
Kudos for the Developers.

16019,One of the Best trucking sims by far along with American Truck Simulator
16020,"Nothing is more important that trucking, this game has changed my life for the better. I no longer have interest in anything else apart from trucking. Hopefully one day this game will inspire future generations to truck. Delivering the cottage cheese and fish fingers to Aberdeen changed my views on society and I now understand the meaning of life. I have quit my job and left my wife and 3 children to lock myself away in my room from society just to truck. I have not left my chair in 75 hours and do not plan on doing so anytime soon."

16081,"Been playing the game for a good while now and honestly, it's been a hell of a lot of fun cruising across Europe and seeing all the different towns and cities.
Game still has its quirks every now and then, but what game doesn't? Especially when it's still expanding deeper into the heart of Russia - a place i'd love to explore in the real world at some point.
The United Kingdom and the older DLC may need some reworks as everything felt like it was copy and pasted; especially the depots. But, I won't fault them as the game is fairly old and they were working with a small team when it started. Some tunnels also need to be properly finished if they have been in the real world.
Absolutely love the game and can't wait to see it finished and I hope they keep tweaking and refining it as time goes on. Hell, it'd be awesome to see them add in electric trucks when they start coming out."

16204,"A hyper-realistic game about truck driving has absolutely no right to be this fun.

Beautiful graphics, wide array of jobs, great progression system.
Controls can take a while to get used to; E.G changing gears, using headlights, indicators, brakes, mirrors, micro-managing the GPS system, etc. But after a while it becomes easier and it's a whole boatload of fun.

You can also change the controls, use different control methods or just use a controller which is a huge plus- although I personally prefer just using KB&M. 

For ~¬£4 in the sale, I would 100% recommend. I don't think I would pay ¬£15 for this game personally, but I can certainly recommend it for that price too.

I can really see myself sinking a lot of hours into this game in the future. 100% would recommend."

16233,"It's a fun, realistic game. I like the fact that you get to manage the finances of your company. You get charged for speeding, crashing, blowing a red light, absolutely everything. It's super fun. Plus, you get tired, run out of fuel, get damage on your truck, trailer, and cargo which affects your final performance and rewards after delivery, not to mention your wallet if you need to repair. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be well optimized for macOS, it's just unplayable (my hardware destroys the recommended settings). But, it runs flawlessly on Windows (I'm using Boot Camp)."

16248,"i played this on a free weekend, did the tutorial half asleep and thought ""eh, not for me"" but i decided to give it another shot the next time round and thats when i found how relaxing it all was, i dont drive IRL and this allows me to just escape to the roads in the country with my music. ended up scooping up the map bundle straight away, some of the earlier DLC countries do feel abit samey, but the variety in locations/assets improves as the DLC's get more recent (with another one still yet to come out).  only clocked about 48 hours on this so far, hoping to increase that Tenfold. this game is amazing and holds up REALLY well considering when it was released, the fact it also is still being regularly updated is incredible too. great job SCS!!!!!"

Highly recommend this game, and you will love to play it. Loads of mods available to enhance your experience. 

The new convoy option is very interactive and it is cool to drive with 7 other trucks from the UK to Turkey!

Please buy this game as it is awesome!"

Each delivery is a new experience, should you have your settings right. 1.41 MP update is amazing, too. Allows for small multiplayer sessions instead of joining a server of ~2k on TruckersMP, great for messing about with mates.

All in all a solid 9/10 for me, as someone who don't like trucks all too much either. Amazing."

16399,"At first I thought that the idea of a truck simulator seemed quite silly, but after giving it a shot I have to say the relaxing feeling you get from driving your truck around and completing deliveries simply is amazing. Wonderful game to play while you are listening to audiobooks, or music.

I've only played it for 4 hours so far but instantly fell in love."
16400,fun
16401,amazing game very epic haha yes
16402,"it is a really fun game to play.

16403,"Personally I never play these kinds of games. However a while ago I bought this on sale for roughly ¬£4. I don't know why but this game was screaming for me to purchase it. So I did. Then I pretty much forgot about it for a couple of months. However the other day I decided to play it, AND WOW AM I IMPRESSED! To my surprise I really enjoy playing this game, it's so relaxing and I can easily spend a good few hours a time playing it. 

You start off as a truck driver for different companies. You get many different routes and destinations to choose from. (You have a wonderful little mini map called Route Advisor to guide you to your destination)
You also get to see the start and end destination before you accept the job. As well as the amount of money you will get for completing the job.

I'm fairly new at this game. So I apologise if I may be slightly incorrect. 

The further you get into the game, the more money and destinations become available. You can start saving up to buy your own truck and trailer to deliver goods. (Which I think allows you to make more money) You can also get more XP for parking the truck manually at set destination. 

The ranges of jobs are amazing. You can deliver many different kinds of cargo and drive many different kinds of trucks. What I also like is that in the UK, our drivers side is the right. And outside of the UK it is the left. The game takes this into account and it's a wonderful challenge to learn to drive both sides.

Another thing to take into account is Speed limits. Most roads/ areas you drive in have different speed limits such as 50mph/60pmh/30mph etc. You can also damage the truck. (I think you can turn this particular setting off) You can get fined for not using your headlights. It can rain. Be sunny and have thunderstorms! (You can turn your wind screen wipers on too!) All buttons are customizable so you can set out the best way for you to play. OH! did I mention there's a chance for some roadside incidents?

There is MUCH MORE to cover. 

Overall this game is great. I love it. You'll love it too."
16404,"Really cool game , i lov it"
16405,"so uhhh... this is really cool, i was on a trip to germany and i took a bus between Munich and Berlin. and on the road i was like ""huh, this is really familiar,"" and i was keep thinking about it, thinking i was a having a deja vu of some sort. and then i realized, ETS2 is the reason why it's so familiar.

16454,"This game, considering its' age, is one of the best simulators still around. This game really shows that there are developers around, that really care about their community. Either with TruckersMP or the home made ETS2 Convoy Mode, this game is fun to enjoy with friends and can deliver hours of gameplay. Europe and ofcourse the states around it are shown in incredible amount of detail, you can really see the whole game has been put together with love. 

Although some parts of ETS2 are still from the early times of 2012, like Great Britain, Poland or the Swiss/Austrian alps this game gives a great experience. Topping things off, SCS plans on reworking the alps region to fit with the rest of today's game. I really hope to see much more rework going on especially in Great Britain and I'm looking forward for the amazing ""Heart of Russia"" DLC! Thank you for the hours of joy and fun, this simulator makes me feel I drive a truck irl."
