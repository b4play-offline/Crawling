27,fun
28,"Fun game, I learned not to get angry at RNG. Lol"
29,"As a mac player, this game is really cool and there aren't many substitutes on OS. It's a really cool and fun game, but playing as a F2P really brings you down. This game is 1/2 a cash grab, and I reccomend not spending any money here, as you'll get too invested. I can't, but if you can, just play World of Tanks.

TL:DR, the game is really fun, but it's kind of a cash grab."

37,good game very fun
38,fun as hell
39,I may be new to this game but so far it is very fun and relatively easy to get accustomed to.
40,Very much alright indeed.
41,"Better not waste your time on Wargaming games at all! Blitz suffered the fate of the older line of games. They constantly change the characteristics of tanks, not for the better, even premium ones. If you do not regularly pay, your premium machine will become dull, and you will lose interest soon. Today you like to play some techniques, and the developers will reduce its characteristics tomorrow. Usually, game creators motivate players to increase excitement, while these games work solely to suppress excitement. There are a lot of much more exciting and honest projects, don't waste your time!"

49,wotb getting worse with the game matching. too easy for credit spamming player to reach high tier but do not know what to do in the game

51,Good game but my team is always trash
52,"Used to be a good game for strategy but has been taken over by 12 year old kids with Mommy's credit card.  Now the only strategy they use  is ' drive forward, mash fire button,'  die, then yell at the ones still alive for not protecting the precious snowflake."

87,based
88,95 % of the time the games are totally unbalanced.
89,I really like this game but it is frequently unplayable because of bugs in the game that Wargaming just cant seem to fix. Currently it keeps kicking me out of games but leaving my tank in the game. It happens about half the time and really sucks for me and my team as it is almost a guaranteed loss for them and me. It has been doing this through the last two updates so Wargaming has had lots of time to fix it.
90,Its a great Game has some amazing WW2 Tanks has everything you would want light medium heavy destroyers its a game for everyone
91,ккласс игра прикольное хотел бы десятку но  уже есть девятка и дефентер мк 1
92,entertaining game
93,"The amount of super bad players in this game makes it beyond unplayable. You will lose most games even if you are relatively good at the game. 40% winrate players in everygame dying within the first min. I would not recommend this game just because of the bad matchmaker and terrible players.
"
94,"I have more than 60 vehicles in garage, all equipment and all the praises in this game. Causes addiction worse than whiskey. Lots of ads, asking you to buy useless items every 5 minutes, cases, boxes, tanks, boosters and so on. I've more than 40K battles, started playing back in 2014 from version 1.2 on an iPad. I saw the game develop, unfortunately it is in the state of stagnation for the last 4 years. Today the game experience is awful. Battles are all the same, there's no adrenaline at all. 80% of battles end in 2-3 minutes. After 1,5 minute in game you probably will find yourself alone withstanding with 7 enemies, as you understand you don't have even a slight chance of winning in this situation. Game community is awful and rude, kids under 15 is a target audience here. For now I don't recommend this game to anyone, if you want to try and play from scratch, be prepaired to spend smth around 100$ to buy premium account and premium tier 8 vehicle (Lowe or T34 - classic farming bundle) and some credit boosters. With all that on Lowe you can pretty guaranteed get 100k per battle (140k for victory and 80k for defeat) I wish Wargaming see this comment and make game better for oldfags that oneday liked the game and helped it develop."
95,"Unfortunately as visual stimulating as the game is, it is a massive cheating apparatus. You have to pay to win, and if you do not the game will screw you  7 ways from Sunday. You won't be able to do damage to lighter tanks, bot profiles will target you from across the map despite being in the midst of other tanks firing at them. Tanks will disappear right as you shoot at them and then reappear after your shot hit the dirt directly behind them. Your shots will go through tanks and cause no damage. Your tank will slow down, point your turret in the wrong direction. Shots will curve  as if you are throwing a baseball curve pitch. Expensive ammunition will fall it the dirt. The percentile impossibilities will happen to you on the battlefield all the time. 

Meanwhile paying players will enjoy the comfortable suite of success,  not having to employ any skill whatsoever and still have a winning percenage and awesome stats. The game also employs a massive amount of AI accounts to pad the fact that they are losing players left and right. Every stat in this game is a lie. And everything is based on greed."
96,lmao
97,"Fun is often talk about when playing certain games. In Blitz, there are many way for players to have fun. 4 roles that determined how the match is going to play out, i think that is what make Blitz fun for me. Don't expect for easy progress, in this game ""grinding"" is a bottomline word. Unless you want to pay some gold and speed up the progress to tier 10. I forgot to tell, that Blitz has it's own progression. Playing from tier 1 to 10, it's hard but possible. Being able to understand mechanics of this game, all of it will make new player enjoy the game a bit more. 4/5

Trust me I've played over 670 hours of it and i'm still having fun, plus it's 100% free to get over 100 tanks in the game and to get them you need to spend a little time sure, but it wont cost you a single dime! So have fun, and i'll see you on the battle field!

120,"The game is pretty frustrating at some times, match making is a mess, rng is kinda decent unless it's about lock boxes, grind is manageable although it would take time to earn credits from tier 7-10 without premium account and vehicles, the latest updates released by wargaming seems to be going in a good way for now. Over all, the game is good and fun specially with friends and during limited game modes."

130,hohohohoh
131,Good game has flying tanks
132,"11/10 story line, would play again."
133,"karena dikasi sekin dan teng geratis coy, mantap gokil."
134,still worth if you buy in discount
135,"The game is ambiguous. It has troubles with new players(balance), donations, community, and technical stuff, but it is sometimes fun and captivating.

Regarding company interests, they focus on newbies as a source of additional money, which makes matches unbalanced and irritating. For example, a player without any skill can get top tanks only through defeats. That leads to a significant fortune factor in matches: will you play in a team with normal players or with beginners? Even on 10lvl tanks, that are supposed for experienced players, it occurs too often. Ranked battles partially solve this problem, but they are influenced by other problems.
What is more, a lot of people believe that accuracy and armor random dispersion is unfair. Say, a great player can shoot a newbie on a light-armored tank without penetration, whereas a newbie may penetrate a heavy-armored tank even in the red zone. Although it is supposed to be unpredictable and random, fortune happens with newbies more often.

The game does not follow the PAY-TO-WIN principle, but grinding is way more comfortable if you pay for tanks that make this process quicker. Also, if you want to get a certain tank which is quite rare, you will need to spin dozens of loot boxes in most cases without any guarantee. Even if there is a guarantee, it demands an unbelievable amount of money.

The community is toxic. Well, it is not the worst one but it lacks calm and patient people. A cult of good statistics exists: gamers become upset when they lose a battle. So oftentimes, they blame teammates for poor skill. I do not know, how the situation is in other regions, but in the russian server, these accusations go along with filthy words. 

Therefore if you want to get a positive experience, I strongly recommend you disable game chat.

NONETHELESS, this game CAN be entertaining, especially with a friend. You can take two T49 and break a battle into a nightmare for enemies, provided that fortune is on your side : ) Besides, it improves tactic variation and team play.

To summarize, this game is not for everyone. That is why I cannot rate it well."
136,play it
137,Good enough but you'll soon realize that the game is designed in a way to make money and not to enteratin. overall decent
138,"It´s clearly a pay-to-win game, but you can still have fun"
139,"Вцелом все более менее адекватно, но пролёты снарядов сквозь танк, интересный, особенно в период ивентов, балансировщик, совершенно необъяснимые и непредсказуемые траектории полета снаряда (вообще почему пробитие или нет определяется рандомом?) в совокупности формируют такое себе представление об игре, однако это не все, фатальный удар наносят сами же игроки: чат полон агрессивных школьников, способных только оскорбить родителей. Тема с ивентами особенно интересна: бои в матчмейкинге делятся на два вида: турбопобеда, когда за 1,5 минуты счет 7:0 в вашу пользу, либо турбопоражение, когда за то же или меньшее время вас сносят всухую, оба случая хаарктеризуются никакущим уроном со стороны игрока и это - главная причина, почему я эту игру не порекомендую в период крупных событий, в обычное время на свой страх и риск можно. Также стоит отметить интересную политику разработчиков в отношении новых вводимых 10 уровней в дерево исследования: вводится новый танк, который ломает все независимо от команды, его статистика начинает сильно выбиваться из общей и танк нерфится, что приводит к недовольству тех, кто уже новую десятку исследовал. Кратко резюмируя, задумка игры хорошая, однако для полноты картины нужно поменять механику стрельбы (я про, так называемый, ""круг разброса""), составить адекватную систему банов, которая будет наказывать плохих игроков, а не хороших, потому что плохих больше и ввести подбор игроков на основании статистики, то есть там, где можно выбрать режим игры, предоставляется настройка твоих противников и союзников по одному из критериев статистики. Да, такая система неминуемо приведет к долгому времени ожидания, но так высокоуровневые игроки смогут исключить фактор ""глупого союзника"", а низкоуровневые игроки не будут портить последним бои."

155,"After the update some assests is not loading anymore and resets everything after a game, now I can't even get past the login screen."

159,"'World of tanks blitz' is a good game with lots of different tanks and a huge selection of play styles. I like how every game feels different and it doesn't get boring for a while because of the large map and tank selection. Some people say that it is bad that the game has lots of pop ups wanting you to pay for special tanks and premium stuff, however it has no ads on mobile and is free so really this is the only way it can make money.
these specialised tanks only give you a slight advantage so the game remains very well balanced.

I have only recently downloaded the game on steam and i used to play it on mobile. I have experienced a well balanced match making system and i have never spent any money on the game and reached tier 10 from just playing casually, this proves it isn't pay to win.

Great game, please reduce the amount of pop ups."

In addition, as of update 9.2, the game crashes on certain maps (Black Goldville, Yamato Harbor, etc.) on the Steam version. Community is also toxic and immature. Time is better spent elsewhere."

196,Good game to start messing with tanks. Easy to get into but beyond lvl 6 or 7 it suffers from the same pay-to-win problem as it's big brother WoT. Stay at or around tiers 1-7 you will have a lot of fun. Beyond tier 7 you WILL have to pay to not make it a painful grind for any tank. Or just spam gold & get a premium.

*Free To Play
*Available Tutorials
*Accessible Meta-Tanks
*Premium Currency is accessible even to free players via Gold/ Boosters earned on Daily Loot-box/Quests
*Fun Modes are sometimes available
*Keyboard Configurations
*Could be played on both Mobile Device/PC
*PC doesn't have ads (good despite the free gold)
*Some premium tanks are accessible via events

Cons
*Matchmaking is broken/unbalanced
*Rating is too weak to even play/rewards aren't fully visible, and therefore most peeps ignore. 
*Community is pretty much Toxic
*Loot-box = Gambling, not for everybody
*Running stock/ <100% crew xp on higher tier is straight up DUMB

This game is ain't cringe, this game just makes me more entertained than before. I rate this game as 9/10 as being Super Great."
227,"i hate games that cost either time or money to progress .
this one is no exception, while not as bad as war thunder with progression it is 100% worse with toxic players and pay to win vehicles, not to mention that the people with no life who spend hours playing this game will farm new players for free wins. don't recommend at all, all this game will do is take away your inner peace."
228,"It is a good game, fun to play.  You will enjoy it until you get a few thousand battles in.

Then the anti-seal clubbing rules kick in, and you will have trouble playing Tier5 and below.  At this point you have to move up to tier 6-10 and run into matchmaking.

Here you have a vast majority of players very experienced with a lot of premium tanks and the best regular tanks.  If you are playing a tank that isn't the best in slot, particularly if you are a top tier heavy, you can lose the game for your team just by being in the game.

Once you get to know what is what, you can tell if you are going to win or lose as soon as you see the teams with 90% accuracy, simply by seeing a weak link in your team and a really bad match.  This is the real problem with smaller teams in every game.  You can see that you have no real counter to certain players, or you are severely lacking in hpts, penetration, or speed.

If you play at peak times, you are going to have a very difficult time.  My advice is to not worry about your stats.  Just play the game.  If you want to know how you stack up play ratings, or look at your stats just in your best tanks that you want to keep."

247,"too many bots that drive right past enemy players, love watching them pass enemy tanks while getting shot and 3,000% oblivious to whats happening in game. you'll get like 4 bots on your team the enemy will get like 2 and you'll just watch your bots get stuck and shoot the ground. happens way too often and it is a deciding variable for winning and losing, more than 3 bots and you might as well idle bc you lost... imagine a game where you're limited on selling things you buy, well you found it. this game only allows you to sell 3 tanks and cuts you off until the next day, why? no one will ever know. kinda goofy they halt you from progressing the game... when you que up for a match you'll see like 180 people looking for a match yet you still get bot in a match, crazy as stated before the bots are trash and will make you lose. matchmaking has really faded away in games, its sad."
248,"""World of xxxx"" has the most poisonous community I have seen of any game. I have been gaming for over 30 years so that is quite an achievement for ""World of"" to be rated as the worst gaming community in 30 years worth of gaming."
249,"This game is good they have historical fantasy in this game like ""Mad Games"" where you get fun and Cool abilities to play with in a specific tank, ""Uprising"" where you get three lives and can get 'New' Abilities when you die and have enough points, and ""Boss Mode"" where you have the chance to Be a Boss on your team, Test New technology and to Destroy the other team's Boss to Win! And for the other modes,  ""Gravity Force"" where you can soar the sky all the way to the moon in an almost NO gravity Battle where you Can fly, ""Skirmish 5v5"", well, you know what it is, a Mode where the map is cut in half and the teams are both 5 players each! Play World of Tanks Blitz Now to Find your fun in this game, Have fun!"

276,Its hard to explain
277,"Pretty good game, more of a console/mobile game than PC but it plays just fine, pretty low demand on terms of power. 
Pros
• Casual gameplay 
• Arcadey (if you consider it one)
• Low stakes
• Good performance 
Cons
• Lots of pop up microtransactions 
• Graphics aren’t very impressive or eye-candy level compared to WoT
• Questionable game choices
Overall pretty fun game, good if you like fast and quick fun, but I’d say just download it on mobile/handheld instead 
"
278,I think this game is close to reality considering all the factors involved in determining a hit. Tanks with different characteristics. Play with others as a platoon or go it alone. It's very challenging because you play against others who may play with different strategies. Many maps to play on. This game was originally made to play on cell phones and you still can although it is easier on a computer. Great way to pass time.
279,ert
280,"good game to pass the time

8/10 game"
281,Played more on mobile. This is a really good game!
282,poor balancing - full of gacha stuffs
283,"I have multiple opinions on this game:

It is definitely a pay for CONVENIENCE game, whilst they do from time-to-time release purchasable tanks with real money that unbalance the game, often times they will correct it and balance the tank out within a patch or 2.

Would definitely recommend if you have a penny or 2 to spend on the occasion.

Would also recommend if you have tons of spare time & patience. 

Console, PC, and blitz all are wonderful variations of a tank game"

307,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

337,Could be a fun game if they would just let you play instead of all these pop ups and alerts about the cool things they want to sell you.  I just want to play the f**king game.  Greedy POS developers.
338,"Matchmaking sucks big time. Most of the time you either get in the team of strong players vs a team of weak players and then you easily win with a team losing 0-2 tanks, or it's the same but now you get in a weak team and can't do anything really single-handedly. But you still get penalised for weak teammates play by getting twice less XP and game money, which is really annoying.
And then occasionally you get to play against a team of tanks mostly a level higher than you, about 3 tanks TWO levels higher than you and only one tank same level as you. Which is nonsense since even a level higher tank has no problem shooting through your armor. Fighting against a two level higher tank is a joke. Nonsense match."

348,"I've been playing WOT_Blitz for 6 years and too be honest I'm quite sad that after all those years I don't recommend this game. This game is what I would call a ""money trap"". The developers actively don't listen to what the players say and make the game paid to win. The game has no matchmaking, no effective report method, and again the developers just simply don't care. I've invested so much time and money into this game and it does break my heart to leave it after 6 years. I think this should say a lot for someone who has played a game for 6 years, spent over $USD 300, participated in countless tournaments to be leaving the game because the company simply just wants to make money and not care about the player base. Hopefully nobody else has to waste their time and money and end up heart broken like I did. Please.............. Don't waste your time on this ""money trap"". It's just simply not worth it."

Earning gold is hard but not as bad as other P2W games. This game ain't P2W but still if you are not grinding much, you can't get golds easily either I don't know the easiest way lol.

365,"Look, I am a long lasting veteran of the game and have been playing for many years (most of those years on mobile) and I can truthfully say that this game is and was fun.

However, it has become a cesspool of microtransactions. You can mostly get by without buying anything from the store but many of your opponents will have premium tanks. Premium tanks do not entirely ruin the game but some of them will make you want to waterboard your monitor.

The only true problem with this game is that the player base is either toxic assholes or 2 year old kids who look like they are trying to drive their toys-for-tots red foot-powered car for the first time.

If you can keep your sanity intact rather well and control your spending, than this game is fun and I would recommend. 7/10"

If you've never played a tank game that's bigger than 50 GIG this one might just impress ya a little. but get it from World OF Tanks you'll need to anyway when you want world of tanks lol

387,help me
388,"Awesome, fantastic, mesmerizing, engaging"
389,"Overall the game itself is pretty okay and can have its fun moments. The problem lies in the community, the players. Same as every other multiplayer game I suppose, so nothing new there.

The issue is the recent influx of new players (Sub 1k battles) and large, large number noobs who can't be bothered to learn to play the game or simply don't want to play well (Players with <45% winrate), and saltbois.

It is very hard for 1 or even 2 decent players to turn the tide when 4 players on the team are either new or noobs who refuse to play well.

What does refusing to play well mean? Well, a few examples would be: players who go alone to one side of the map, Light Tanks that play like Sniper Tank Destroyers and don't move to spot, Heavy Tanks that don't move to the Medium Tank side of the map when the map or matchmaking needs them to help the MT side in order to win.

There have been cases where the opposing team has no Heavy Tanks, yet my own team's 1 Heavy Tank will stubbornly go to sit in the corner where it can't help the rest of our team on the my side of the map. Worse is when a Tank Destroyer or another Medium or even Light Tank decides to go help them, but no enemies are there at all. So the my side gets trounced in a 7v4, while 3 players drive around doing nothing.

Another big issue is all the saltbois in this game. You could be doing your best but if almost half the team is away and isn't supporting you or giving covering fire, it is very hard to perform well. Saltbois will still confusingly blame you for the loss.

Or maybe as a Heavy Tank that has weak armour and long reloads like the French line you logically should be playing more of a 2nd line role, but saltbois will expect that as a Heavy Tank you should be up on the frontlines like a VK100P or something.

I have nothing against new players with less than 1k battles at all, especially when they follow the team, communicate, and try to do their best. 

The issue is, a some, or quite a lot of these new players refuse to follow the team sometimes, or just blindly charging ahead despite the whole enemy team being right in front of them having been spotted for a while.
These stubborn players are potentially future noobs who will refuse to learn how to play the game and refuse to cooperate with teams.

Lastly, in many multiplayer games it is argued that you can have fun with friends. That is also possible here and strongly encouraged. If you can somehow fool a friend into wasting time on this game, it is not only possible to have fun, but also for you to get more wins. 

Platoons, 2 player pairs within a regular team of 7 tend to have a better time of winning or at least performing well simply because they communicate and cooperate better. They tend to cover and help each other as well. Alongside this, the probability of 1 player going off alone somewhere or being uncooperative is now reduced from 6/7 to 5/7, so there you go."
390,"No skill involved, if you play like trash you get better matches and rng to help you ""win"", play good and you're rewarded with rigged rng to make you lose and crap teams who do less damage combined than yourself.  In short, play like trash to ""win"" play good and lose."

394,Crappy game filled with micro transactions and not very good gameplay.
395,thx for 1 year
396,"just a heads up, yes i know it say i only have 95 hours. TLDR, lost steam account. 

so i have bin playing this game for about 6 odd years now. it can be really fun and thrilling. the key word is ""can"". most of the time it is full of people who dont know how to play from tier 7 and up. tiers 1-6 are devoted to new players, and less its an old player going down there i dont really see all that much improvement among the tiers. this could be fixed if WG fixed the tutorial to actually tell you how to really play the game rather then just how to move, shoot, and how in the tutorial you just cant die at all. but that is the least of the problems. half the games are just who can camp more, and the other half are feeling more and more like a free for all but its p2w too. why does that sound like war robots? (then again war robots is p2p so technically thats better) and dont you dare complain about p2w or p2p what so ever. you dont want to get harassed by the enemies (and allies sometimes) both in and out of the match do you. i mean how can you be mad when you have p2w tanks your self. right?. what do you mean you dont. the tier 10 premiums are like 20 bucks come on. oh and dont forget to praise RNG. because if you cant hit the broadside of a barn while face hugging it at point blank from the inside the barn. then you are just sh*t at aiming. now watch as you get sniped from the complete opposite side of the map, by the tank with the worse accuracy in the game. if and only if WG fixes the p2p, RNG bs, the tutorial, and both WG and the community at large work together to curb the toxic sh*t hole that regular can turn into. then i will repost this comment and praise how fun the game is, and how even through all that shit it has helped me in ways i cant say here less i want to counteract my own review. but untill then, this stays."
397,Shoot.
398,"I was wrong about tanks until now, they actually have hp"
399,"НЕ СКАЧИВАЙТЕ ЭТОТ МУСОР!!!!
Я, когда увидел wot biltz подумал что это новые танчики, которые будут лишены вонючей арты, карты стали меньше, больше геймплея и т.п.
Это все правда, да. Так игра выглядт действительно значительно лучше, но... Но гребанное комьюнити оленей, просто забывающих как дышать и пытающеися играть в эту игру - это то, что ее убивает. У меня в этой игре был 75% побед на 300 боев, я выкладывался как тварь, нанося минимум 1000 урона на каждый бой где-то 3-4 уровней. И все было неплохо. Но союзники, которые просто едут в лоб на противника и даже не пытаются спрятаться/стрелять/делать хоть что-нибудь.... Просто убиваются об противника, оставля тебя одного против всей комманды противника. Играть невозможно.
Итог: если решили это скачать - запаситесь нервными клетками в огромных количествах, оно вам понадобится. Удачи!)"
400,"to everyone whining and bitching about the game: if it's that bad then don't play it. it's that simple. it's a great game, and if you keep crawling back just be grateful it exists."
401,"spent 200 on a mobile game, very good"
402,it`s fine
403,"Total unbalanced game full of new players who are supported by WG to get X tier tanks even if they dont know how to play with them.Also unbalanced Matchmaking comparing high WR players with players with few games and zero experience.Another big problem are the crates forcing the player to gamble.Horrible toxic community.No relevant support from the developers who are oriented only in money.Adding useless content,modes etc,etc.After 8 years the game still has ghost shells,graphic glitches and bugs.
Definitely not recommended."

406,nep nep nep nep
407,Lose when you capture a point? ok
408,good fun
409,The Game used to be good we had a good clan good atmosphere good relationship with other clans then they got rid of the chat system that killed the game in my opinion i understand why they did it due to the war in Ukraine but they should of kept the chat working and expelled the russian speakers to there own servers where there meant to be but no they didnt now chat is destroyed and now i believe Blitz is dead as well and dont get me started on Ping crashes i thought it was my PC i upgraded my PC WOT PC works fine War Thunder Works Fine World of Tanks Blitz keeps crashing

434,"i have never been so disgusted by a game and its community. the matchmaking is so rigged and abysmally balanced. completely one sided. do not waste your time on this game, if you for some reason do, i beg of you to save your money instead of blowing your wallet out on this scheme by russians... this game has a toxic community, the competitive field is scuffed and a total waste of time unless you have true talent. the rewards are a complete scam, the meta is completely unethical, every tank thats implemented is more broken than the next, for some reason the type 71 hasn't been nerfed yet, the new aiming system is garbage, and the general playerbase knowledge of the game is quite saddening. i've been with this game since 2015 or so, and the developers are completely two faced, lying leeches, and are always in for the interest of themselves... they dont even play the game, instead just implement more garbage that either nobody asked for or is crying to be nerfed or removed/reverted, completely ignoring playerbase input. the discord server is a pigsty, have fun getting banned for 2 weeks just for calling someone unintelligent. the game is dying, ideas are running dry, and its best to jump off the sinking ship before it gets worse."
435,yay

438,"Do you like pain? Do you like suffering? Are you an avid enjoyer of masochism? If so, then Blitz is the game for you. Janked hit-boxes, ridiculous PTW mechanics, classically bizarre loot boxes and a whole hell of cursing at the game has been my life since I picked it up in 2017.

Having been someone who's played the game at high levels of tourney play, believe me when I say that the toxicity I experience in this game has been unparalleled. You be hard pressed to find worse in a COD lobby, believe me. That and the fact that the military honour does nothing to root out griefers and spammers only adds to the mess this game is.

The developers seems to have found the ability to milk us cattle for our money with camo skin after camo skin, and new tank line after new tank line while failing to balance the extremely... idiosyncratic gameplay between different tank types. I think those at Wargaming have lost the ability to hear our pleas of help while we wallow in the pits of smasher bonks and light tank tourney hell. It wouldnt be hard to level out the fun of the gameplay, yet instead of listening to the player-base and making meaningful changes, instead they choose the 5-year-old-blessed-with-chocolate approach and smearing it all over their faces while swimming in our cash. 

For the actual gameplay performance itself, I must say its... alright. The massive server crashes have gradually been fixed, the strange, inexplicable bounces caused by client desyncs gradually squashed under bug fix after bug fix and bloat has been cut from file-sizes. However, fundamentally the game always leaves me in a cloud of despair afterwards, when I'm forced to watch my teammate have a seizure at the wheels of his tank and throw perfectly winnable game after game. That's where the fundamental flaw of this game lies - public gameplay. In no way can you carry a team past a 1 v 3 unless you have snorted copious amounts of methamphetamine and are playing with the spirit of RNGesus possessing your mortal frame. And relying on your team is like relying on a Gregg's bakery to make a bad pasty - it just doesn't happen. That's why actual tourney play is the only way to really play nicely. Get some friends, and go club seals until the blood covers your face and the visceral rage is coursing through your veins - until you realise that the developers f****** the brackets up and all your amazing shots and driving around various similarly-textured rocks and assorted grass models means nothing.

Indeed everything about this game left me vacuous, incomplete in my own soul, as I poured money into it for little to no reward. Hell, I even set up a YT channel to make my life better while playing but to no avail. The amount of PTW, bugs, team-mates playing from ICU wards and overall jank will just leave a sour taste in your mouth that never really leaves..... 

Until you log on tomorrow. Because this game is stupidly addictive. It will eat your life up, so be warned. Stay away. I couldn't. And it almost killed me."

449,"This is an unbiased opinion: 

This game CAN be fun if you're willing to either spend a lot of time and OR money on this game.

It can take a while to grind for the best tanks, and certainly take a lot of money to BUY the best tanks. 

However, War Gaming ever so often creates events for you to get relatively good if not op premium/collectible vehicles. ( The Panzer IV Gargoyle or ""Goyle"" for short is one example of WG giving out a free op tank. )

Anyways, if you get past the whole ""pay to win"" part of this game, you can have fun!"

455,"This game is filled with bots and unfair matchmaking. After many countless battles you will notice that no matter how hard you try you somehow still lose while doing over 4k damage. The problem with this game is that Wargaming mixes skilled players with unskilled players in higher tiers, so no matter how hard you try to win a match the ""unskilled"" players just ruin it for you, which really cripples your win rate. This game use to be fun at one point but nowadays it's just a quick cash grab for Wargaming."

480,"The game is pay to win.
Though it doesn't mean you can't outsmart those wallet warriors, the better the crew, the better it performs, plus those additional items or stuff, you won't really feel the change, so don't buy the items that are really expensive.
And don't go lonewolf, follow your team or atleast let them know where youre heading before complaining that your team didn't help you, and lastly don't be a hero, if you don't know how armor works just stay behind your team mates and munch some HP of some enemy who are trying to be the hero. That's all I can advice you if youre a newbie, if you want to learn more watch some videos on Youtube or something.
(P.S. I don't recommend this to people who gets angry at games. Like seriously bro just don't.)

481,"If you like to stay sane dont play this crap or his bigger brother WoT.

Im veteran in World of Tanks normal version ( 6x X tier and hundreds other tanks, years of playing ).

From the beginning i think Blitz is much better, but thats what they make u think. You get ""tutorialized"" by killing player-bots for few tiers. Then you realize its same annoying game as its bigger brother WoT.

So if you like to stay calm and keep your sanity, dont play this. GL"

510,"I love to load into a game, be bombarded with multiple advertisments for extortion-level deals and events (some apparently having nothing to do with historical gameplay at all), joining a match with a generic map, spending two straight minutes edging around a corner trying to hit someone, then being hit at long range by a fictional pay-to-win tank destroyer whom I knew was there but couldn't see because of an absolutely broken spotting system and finally being cursed at by a cocky player on my team who did no better than me. 
Did I mention the fact that broken 'modules'' (things like the gun, crew, and tracks) can be broken by hits, and then repaired at the touch of a button? Just like that? Or how the combat mechanic is literally just RNG + hitpoints, nothing more? To be fair, this game is alright if you're looking for an arcadey kind-of-thing, but not if you're into actual historical gameplay, significantly varied tactics between maps, or realistic mechanics.  Admittedly, I'm probably biased seeing as this is what I expected going in to it, but the fact that the game itself doesn't advertise these things is a little frustrating in my opinion."

517,"I've been playing this game since 2015 and I've had a mostly positive experience throughout. It's easy to pick up and play a game that doesn't last more than a few minutes and the grinding, while tedious, does feel rewarding. People will complain about P2W but Wargaming has done a decent job keeping 90% of the tanks in this game balanced and there are plenty of free vehicles that are still a joy to play. There are toxic players as with any MMO but I've met some great people on here as well. I didn't think I'd still be here years later but it's still a good game and superior to the PC counterpart IMO. Just don't buy lootcrates."

The problem isn't in the game but its players but maybe its for my own side as I play in APAC(asia) server. The rewards is better than the original World of Tanks as this have small/weekly/daily achievements for you to grind but still this is how mobile monetization works as small achievements give players a dopamine to grind until you drain all the small missions for the day. I do not recommend this game as your main game still play the original WoT or WT."

601,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

612,Fun game for those on tablet or a low graphic PC.
613,This is really great!
614,Amazing game! Been playing for 6 years!
615,my tanks suck so i stop
616,"This game was really good when i started to play it 6 years ago, but WG started making desicions to add more premium tanks that are better than tech tree tanks , making game too easy for new players to get on tier X in 300 battles which seems like good thing but its not new players should stay on lower tiers until they gain some experience to not ruin games to others. The game was allways matter of skill but today its matter how much money did you put to the game to get unbalanced tanks that means its just Pay to Win. Balance team just dont know what they are doing, i will take example on Maus. Icon of game, Maus will be next patch literally nerfed when its just now really bad tanks that almost no one plays. Maus gun is bellow the average its movement is just bad and armor is average , then WG realease Type 71 which has better gun, better armor and better mobilty, thats one of the problem in game. WG is focusing more on money than the game they giving us too much events mostly where you need to pay. The game was for new players kinda hard 5 years ago, today its just too easy.
Battle passes arent bad but new players are gaining too much from them the missions should be harder and more challanging. Match Making is just bad the battle can be lost just because of one player, on X tier its mostly that new player bought X tier premium/collector tank or in 300 battles got tier X tank. Public battles are just chaos, the game is full of bad players.MM should divide bad players from good and decent players.
The next thing, the new event on the day it started just didnt work, players were disconnected from servers and spam bug that made everyone who got chat on, just to crash game expect the spamer who got thanks to that 10k dmg. The game is in big mess and if WG wont do anything their players will just leave. Im just really sad to see game i really like in this state. WG should listen more to community and change thing to better.
About this whole thing you need to make your own opinion but i feel lot of players who knows this game for a long time will propably agree."

664,"Well, what to say... The game is popular, addictive at once, very interesting. Yes, there are a couple of problems, but it doesn't stand out in the big picture. 8/10"
665,this made me fart aggressively
666,"This game and its community sucks. Don't waste your time exposing yourself to an absurd level of stress.

This game has a toxic and racist community. In most matches, you will see players cursing each other. Today (25/06) the game is celebrating its 8th anniversary. And guess what? THERE IS NO anti-spam system for the chat. Toxic players will spam over and over, until the match is over. It doesn't matter if you're a good or bad player, the matchmaking system will screw you over. Usually you find a match between 5 to 30 seconds. However, the biggest problem is in balancing the teams. The matchmaking will put you with a bunch of idiots who don't know how to play (even if they're tier X) and your team won't help you. They will curse you, even if you're the best player in the team.

Do I need to talk about the spotting system? No. It's trash and doesn't work as it should.

Do I need to talk about the RNG system? No. It also doesn't work properly.

Sincerely, I just uninstalled the game, I recommend you do the same.



UPDATE: I gave it a second chance. Things only got worse. Now I need to visit my friend once a week (he's a psychiatrist)."
667,"shit game shit team shit people shit balance, 8/10 would play again"
668,low 8
669,"Just play the original game, not this shitty blitz version"
670,having fun playing this game
671,sss
672,P2W hell. fuck this game.
673,tanks go boom is good
674,"game used to be good, now its bad"
675,f2p diomand:)
676,"The game have the same matchmaking of world of warships, it let you be from 50% to 60% victory rate, they make you think the shot go casual in the aim circle spot, but when you have to lose it go casual always to fail the shot, when you have to win it hit even if you mistake the shot or shot at max size of the circle. It occur even to not penetrate the armor even if isn't mark red when you have to lose and matchmaking create always winning teams and loser teams. The game is fun if you are relaxed to this scam, only premade teams vs premade teams can play fair here, all the rest will leave the game play with them.

I play it sometime relaxed knowing about this ""scam"" and i will never spend my money on it."
677,it is fun and has good fps
678,good game.
679,dr disrespect
680,ok
681,It's becoming the standard of got your wallet gaming. You know the kind of game where they make the next level of upgrades so grueling to get to that some people will actually pay money to get it. Largest problem with this game is horrible match making which should be done on a skill ranking not just by tier. Sadly even if you spend money on a premium tank the advantage can be small. Unless you dump a ton of money trying to get one of the best tanks in the game via a percentage drop. The game has its charms but at the end of the day you can't buy team mates and this game is a complete waste of time and money.
682,bring back normal tanks
683,"It may be free to play, but it constantly is begging for cash with constant updates and notifications to drag you into the shop."
684,Very good game good graphics and Good MM
685,"tank go brrr
"
686,Bruh it scammed me 129 SGD
687,good enough tank game not too bad
688,"The game is great UNTIL - the game creators have ZERO ability to properly match 7 players per team.   Other teams consistently are heavily armored, can shoot from invisible positions, destroy YOUR tank in 1 hit after you just pegged them 5 or 6 times with zero impact to their power levels.      You get matched with worthless team players and bots that have NO sense of helping you win.   I played over 5K games learning the game but now with new username it is still the same old BS.  Even with a higher WR you still get matched with crap."
689,tank
690,AMAZING
691,very good
692,"best free to play tank game on steam
"
693,"Good game, could be inproved but not by much."
694,i am in constant pain
695,Don’t really need to say much other than you have no idea what you are missing out on if you don’t have this game sometimes you might have very very bad players on your team but no matter what this game is still very enjoyable
696,"Cool game 
A lot of tanks 
Good maps but we need a new ones and new events"
697,epic
698,"Great game. The fact that this game runs on every platform (mobile, desktop, and console), has an arcade like drop and go game play with PC gaming quality is insane to me. Each match takes only 2-3 minutes, oh and if you die early, you can just grab another tank and go! Think of this more of a competative vehicle combat game and you are better understanding what world of tanks. World of tanks blitz is the streamlined version of the PC game."
699,VERY FUN I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD PLAY IT I THINK ITS FUN MY FRIENDS THINK ITS FUN AND I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD EXPIRIENS FOR OTHER GAMERS LIKE ME.
700,"Its good but flawed 
"
701,"The best tank game I've played. All the tanks are balanced and because of it, World of Tanks outputs a fun experience. Where everything is based around staying as a team, there is a little friction as new players are just as likely to be queued with an experienced player. This game is very easy to pick up, because the game gives such a colorful explanation on how to play it. Its also free, which is crazy knowing how well-made this game is.

Developers are still, constantly adding material to the game even to this date, since Aug 2010.
I remember playing WoT on my Kindle Fire and loving it. This game truely has been apart of my childhood as one of my favorites.

If you haven't tried World of Tanks, i insist you do.

However, these are really the only good aspects of this game.

As its progressed through the years, the game has made some very questionable adjustments- the game is a lot more pay to win, and Wargaming is really trying to get you to make some form of purchase. I mean, as you boot up the game and enter your tank lobby, you are bombarded with in-app purchases. I personally find that to be very annoying for such a great game.

As far as imbalance goes, this game would be the defenition. Its for one PTW, and secondly, certain tanks in this game are questionably stronger than others. For instance, the KV-2 is a tier VI tank that does 622-700 dmg in one shot. Whenever the avg health at tier 6 is < the dmg a tank can output, you cause imbalance to the game.

For new players, if you want to have a good experiance, spend money on the game. Its fun that way.
For experianced players, if any more even exist; your better off deleting the game."
702,good graphics and if your in to strategy games you would like this. You need to have some time to grind the game as well. This game is so fun to play with friends and sometimes satisfying. you can join your friends clan and play tournaments together.
703,"good game, too many pay to win"
704,"The game is too simple, just aim and shoot, it is not difficult and very boring, but I believe that if this game is improved, it will definitely be a very fun game, and I also look forward to the future updates of this game."
705,Wouldn't recommend for the grinding you have to do to get good tanks or the stupid amount of crates with 0.001 percent chance to get a mediocre tank. Its still fun tho.
706,The game is ridiculously rigged. It's the only game I can think of in which I lose resources for winning. STUPID.
707,rage
708,its cwl
709,"It is the worst place to invest your time and money. This is not free to play, it is free to download. A lot of people(some shouldn't be recognized as humans) get really angry in this game. Nobody cares about you, nobody likes you(if you chose to commit such terrible self harm as playing this 'game'). The best selling offer - lootboxes(because everything comes in lootboxes duh). It's just a casino with extra steps. So, instead of disrespecting your money and time better support your local ladies of the night kids. To sum up, РУССКИЙ ВОЕННЫЙ КОРАБЛЬ, ИДИ НАХУЙ!"
710,yes
711,"Fantastic game that makes me want to KMS every time i play it, the community is fantastic if you like being called slurs. Tournaments are fun and interesting if you can spend hundreds of dollars unlocking the newest BALANCED tanks."
712,.
713,this game is very fun and addictive but sadly you can't fuck the tanks :((
714,owh
715,Best
716,very addictive and fun
717,its nice and fun
718,"It might not be as complete as the original World of Tank, but it's not a bad option. First of all, it can be playable in a decent computer (I played the most on a Lenovo ThinkPad, which is a office/college laptop) and doesn't need the same requirements as Elden Ring to be really playable. Second point: tech tree is really similar to the ""vanilla"" game, but I found some tanks that are or aren't available in comparison with standard game (some of Tier 2 or 4 tanks were part of battle pass). People complain that the game it's pay to win, and they are right there, but this is a PC port of a mobile game, so only try-hards would buy premium tanks here. A good point is that sometimes there are events where you can get free tanks just by playing. The game modes are not as good as the standard version tho, since it's really limited, but again: originally it's a mobile game.

Overall, I give it a 6/10. It's good to spend 30 minutes of gaming if you cannot play the standard game or if you want to learn the World of Tanks mechanics. But otherwise, just play original World of Tanks, since it's a better game than Blitz"
719,tank pew pew game
720,Love this game!
721,"nice game
"
722,"Attention: I only recommend the game if you want something to just pass the time if you are not willing to put money into it.

The game used to be fun and fair but since I last came back to it (new to this Steam Version) I have seen a massive increase of paid content and not talking about small 0.99$ or 1.99$ offers, talking about a bigger investment for something that is basically a mobile version of the game.

Another thing to take into consideration is that War Gaming seems to have moved on from this particular game in order to focus more on their main game (WarThunder).

If you like this kind of games and have something better than a potato and also value your time, move to War Thunder. Again WoT Blitz is fun but nowadays you encounter a lot of bots and most of the clans seem inactive"
723,"i love this game, even a potato could run it, it takes up minimal space, and is interesting enough to get you to keep playing after the first few tank tiers"
724,Real mates in the game.
725,its gud
726,the game is fun and entertaning
727,"laggy, bad packet loss for no reason"

733,Really good game! It's free to play and and there are dozens of historically accurate tanks. You should really think about getting it.
734,Very fun but can get boring
735,.
736,Great free game
737,ez gem
738,"This game is not balance in the way of determine team player, they will put pro with pro and nub team with nub.. so most new player will have 20% win and 80% losing.. dont spend any money on this game"
739,"This game has alot a historical tanks i would recommed it to players its has good tank graphics like a meduim high range of graphics but it has tons of maps and the updates may intrudose a new tank there are heavy tanks,light tanks,medium tanks, and tank destroyers there are tons of historical tanks in this game you grind to early world war tanks to cold war tanks grind to tier 1 to teir 10 you need to fight and upgrade your tanks to be strong in battle and yea i would recommend it"

751,Nooo.....I'm not addicted what r u talking about
752,yes
753,"The worst Game in the World! They make loot box only and  other stuff for donation. I couldn't reconnect if my internet disappear for 5 seconds. I should restart game for reconnecting. They propose me decrease graphics settings after restart game when I had problem with internet connection. The best programmers in this company. I had 10 games and won only one, best balancer that I know.  I just wanted to take my x2 experience on 1 tank, but I wasn't able to do it for more then one hour... I had a good mood, but this game completely ruined it for me."
754,Good Game
755,"I really like the gameplay of this game. It's tactical enough that you don't just hold down the fire key and move around; you have to move, aim and fire. It also really helps to cooperate, so I think earning a reputation for helping out buddies would be a real plus. I am a old guy and not really used to all this mousing about, so I would really love it if they added controller support, but I don't know if that's hard to do."
756,"The matchmaking is garbage, avoid this game if you don't wanna go insane"
757,This game is so unbalanced is so many ways I don't even know where to start. IT IS THE WORST GAME EVER!!!
758,Great game
759,"dont camp in spawn pls its cringe, skill issue, bad."
760,Just play War Thunder or regular WoT if you're on PC anyway.
761,wargaming has made a great game its only down side in my opinion is its pay to win
762,"ok played the new game modes
big boss: it ok BUT the big f*cking floaty gravity orb f*cker can go suck a big bag of dicks

817,"A lot of bots (or just bad players), same bs matchmaking like in the regular pc game. This was supposed to be a mobile game but i guess its not anymore... and i feel bad for the people who play it on a mobile. Players with some brain starts to appear after tier 7-8 and thats where its ends lol. tiers 9-10 matches feels as stupid as tier 1-5. Just way too many brain dead players. Touch grass kids play on tier 5s and increase their win rate to 70-80% and then brag about their skill. i dont recommend."

819,vftg6re
820,yee
821,this game has a lot a customisation and i would highly recommend it
822,"This game has become a part of my daily routine.  Love the game, but hate it just the same.  About 4 years ago the game was much better in term of teams you get put in with.  The competition was high and you really had to work and gain some skill prior to playing in higher tier tanks.  Over the past year War Gaming has made buying higher tier tanks so easy for new players.  Fair enough, you have to make money, however, when playing in a tier 8, 9 and 10 tier battles with some of your team members having less than 400 battles under their belt.  They have yet to understand the dynamics of tanking properly along with the skill of map awareness, positioning, or even Tank role.  It really makes tanking frustrating when you are suddenly in a battle with 2 V.S. 7 in a matter of seconds after the battle starts.  War Ratings have suffered and Rating Battles are a joke now with these teams.  Matchmaker is broken!  I believe you need to change something, I say, ""Just because you have a tier 10 tank, doesn't mean you should drive it"".  I think tier battles should be available to a players depending on how many battles you have.  Once you have reached a set number of battles then you can progress into a new tier to battle within.  That way players in the higher tiers have a better skill set which will make battle more competitive and a lot less frustrating.  Other than that, Love the game!"
823,It's a great and easy-going game. I've been playing for almost a decade now.
824,patch 9.0 so trash
825,nice
826,"very good very nice, highly reccommend"
827,i got to drive real tank
828,"WOT blitz

830,"This Version of w.o.t. is 'fun and simple'. It take 3g's of storage. Got the Warhammer bundle for 75% off and that's all you need. The progressing of Blitz is better than the other version.

That other version is a super cash grab and toxic and the dev's spam you with buy this, Buy this. every day.
Looking for a Decent Tank Game?  Blitz is IT."

836,"What I liked about this game, is that it's fast paced, casual, and could play 60 fps on low end laptops. I recommend it for people who aren't competitive and don't like spending too much time on video games."
837,"this is a good game, well overall the MM (Match Making) is a bit off, where as 50% chance to have a bad players on my team and 50% chance for the enemy team have good players. Would really suggest this game as a cooperative and fun game if the MM is fixed for real. Been in this game for 4 years and experienced the problems from so many updates. So hopefully able to get it fixed.

859,What a disaster of a game. Inconsistent all around.

861,GOOD WITH PC
862,"Game's pretty rigged. Before you accuse me of lying, I'm just saying if I'm running 2k-4k damage a match and still losing game after game, it's not me, it's the match making system stacking it against me. Because I'm running 2k-4k damage as either first or second. Rest of the team is below 1k, which is abysmal. Just like all games like this, TBF. There literally isn't a game on the market with similar gameplay as this game that isn't rigged. It's called ""suffering based marketing."" All companies from former soviet states/Russia employ it, and I just don't understand the culture behind it. It's like it's a communist thing, you know? Because a lot of communist/former communist states around the world use the same marketing strategies in the companies they own.
Also, recently the game has been performing poorly. As if the optimization for it has generally fallen behind in priority. A new battle pass isn't the most important thing, making sure the game performs well is. I can barely get 30FPS on low graphics anymore. It's abysmal."
863,eh

882,"It's a really fun game but only when your team works together, otherwise most of the time you will probably end up losing you can try and tell your team to stick together but when you have Tier VII+ the won't listen 97% of the time. I suggest finding a clan when you become a Tier VI."
883,"it good
"
884,"its a good game, more good than WOT, i mean the gameplay. progression is fast, only 400 battles and i reached tier VI, in WOT i played for 500 games and still at tier IV with weak tanks. so i like WOTB than WOT

the problem is one for me, i played on my android and pc, graphic is cool in android with high graphic, but why on my pc the graphic so bad, i5 10400f ram 16gb gtx 1650 Super is not good enough?

thats my problem, sorry for bad english 😁"
885,muy entretenido y realista. ideal para pasar el rato en la oficina en los momentos de ocio.
886,"SUCH A GREAT GAME!!      SO MUCH FUN!! The only thing i wold change is to not make the some tanks O.P.  But That's Not A Big Deal,    I recommend This Game"
887,Match up system needs to be reviewed and player stats must be considered when creating teams. You can only do so much but if the team is novice then you wont win. Very frustrating. Not worth spending your money in this game.
888,tank
889,ammo racks go boom
890,"So, I were playing like for almost 4 years, I know you might see 120 hours on it but it's because I were playing on phone, so I recommend to play this game because it's kinda interesting to buy tanks and grind for other one. I had a lot of fun playing this game."
891,"At first I hated it. Then I really hated it. Then I left it a bad review. I guess that I kind of like it now.

It's a nice little game with fast matches that don't require a massive time commitment.

I will say that the biggest problem with this game is that it is cross-platform. Specifically, PC & Mobile. Mobile players have to deal with crappy touch controls and they're barely able to do anything in this game. They'll often drive and get stuck on walls, rocks, go afk, etc. As a PC player you can literally go into a random high spot and just repeatedly shoot them all down, often without taking a single shot of damage. They also often solo rush into the entire enemy team and die.

I believe that is what someone was talking about in regards to matchmaking. Your chances of winning is extremely dependent on how many mobile players you have on your team. I've had 7v7 matches where none of us died, and I've had matches where it's 1v5 because everyone on my team died because they just rushed in one after another. Really wish there was a PC only option."

I'm not saying this because I'm a bad player, I'm not, I'm just smart and am able to figure stuff out, and have spent $3,000+ on this dogwater game. Please, for the love of god, buddha, whoever tf you worship. Do Not Download This Forsaken game. I beg of you. Wargaming gives no shits about their community and only care about money."
925,fun
926,"I was playing Fortnite and I got bored and downloaded this. And my experience was amazing! The graphics, the concept, everything. This will definitely keep me busy while I wait for the new season of Fortnite to drop. I just wish there were free color customizations options. And I wish this wasn't pay to win. But overall I think this game is AMAZING! I've only played for 2 days but I would totally recommend!"
927,verrr good
928,"After playing the real WOT this one is OK..  For only being a 5 GB file size, you definitely get that in this game.   Graphics are low and hard as hell to aim.  Better graphics and better controls would make this game a lot better.  6/10."
929,too much toxicity and match making is horrendous and no transparency by war gaming towards offenders!
930,banger
931,"meh i guess its not as try hard as the PC version but it still looks shit, the controls are shit, the players are shit. The thing that makes me play this game is that its just so easy to gain wins in comparison. ive checked my stats in the weblabs and have easily past 3000wn8, which in the PC version is one of the reasons why im always so stressed playing. theres no gun marks which they could have to be fair. there are some funky maps which, for some, are not in the PC game which is interesting to learn. there are some questionable aspects such as the mobile popups and the crates system. the crate system seems way too overpriced for what it is. maybe they are trying to create a christmas loot boxes feel all year round but in my opinion just removes the excitement and i dont see anyone buying into it. honestly this game is like the child version of WOT PC and feels like its on EASY MODEand if that appeals to you like it does to me for a bit of change then chur"

937,For sure
938,"The most played game in my life.
since 2017.I love this game"
939,this is the best game ever
940,"I had a lot of fun playing this game, but ultimately the experience became too bad because of being pitted against higher tier tanks that I could not even damage because of not being able to penetrate their armor. It's also frustrating that people can pay to win by buying expensive tanks with real money and boosting their crew xp with real money"
941,"This game is at a point where there are more ads than game.

The constant and incessant badgering and begging players to get them into buying premium or gold is probably the most aggressive thing in gaming history. You literally have to close pop up ads before you can progress with the game. Truly pathetic.

It's simply too much work dealing with a failing company's desperate and laughable attempt at aggressive advertisement. Honestly, if the game was any good, players would voluntarily pay big money. Unfortunately this game stayed at its 2011 level of nonsense.

Not to mention that WG donates money to Russia's war effort against Ukraine but later desperately tried to cover it up. Stop playing, stop paying, uninstall and stop funding war crimes."
942,"This game is absolutely fucking bullshit. Every single server lags out, and its filled with nothing but toxics assholes that just tell you a lot of derogatory terms. Do not play this worthless piece of crap game"

972,"After playing World of Tanks PC for about 100 hours, I got tired of it and decided to give World of Tanks Blitz a try. And I must say, I've been having a lot more fun playing this game rather than the PC version. Some people like to criticise WOTB for its graphics but that isn't such a big deal to me. I choose to prioritise gameplay over aesthetics. The maps are smaller, meaning you encounter the enemy much faster. The battles are quicker, faster paced and more fun. There are cases in WoT PC where some maps are so big that, if you are playing in a slower vehicle, such as a heavy tank or a tank destroyer, there's a good chance you won't even be able to spot a single enemy and the battle will end before you even get the chance to fire a shot. This is not the case in WOTB, you will never see this happen. Besides, what I like about this game so much is that it's much more accessible to beginners. Its core mechanics are less complex and easy to understand. Everything is simplified, and not in a bad way. A third feature which makes WOTB better than WoT PC is the removal of controversial vehicles, which a lot of players dislike, such as the wheeled tanks and the artileries. In conclusion, I highly recommend that you give this game a try. It will not disappoint you and it may turn out to be your new favourite game, just like it was for me."
973,GREATE GAME VERY SATISFYING. BUT HARD FOR BEGINNERS.
974,"Grinding simulator, which at the same time punishes players for grinding. Also full of bots and AFKers, with no simple way to report them, and a system that instead punishes ANY normal player that happens to have an unlucky match.

Slightly better than regular WoT."
975,Asia server alway lagging and alway met premium OP tank => :((
976,good game
977,For me this game is better than normal WoT. I love premium shards. idk why but i think when u got premium RNG is with u :D. Come play this game i have to gring it alone :D
978,amazing game a must play get good at tier 5 and up
979,"
Nice"
980,"Blitz in name and in fact.


Fast  matchmaking &  fast fight ... a lot of adrenaline

certainly at the level of strategy it is limited but at the level of action it is the top.

At almost 500 hours of play (active not afk or awol) I can confirm the validity of Wot Blitz is continuously updated (not always at the best but the defective updates are corrected almost immediately) to keep the players busy every day they release tasks and there are even the weekly tasks, if you play consistently it makes no sense to spend real money to me no that you do not want to have dozens and dozens of tanks in the garage.

989,ok
990,I beg you dont play this... and if you're reading this and already played just know you're not alone. #Metoo
991,"Neither bad nor really good. It's a quick game of 5 vs 5 multiplayer tank game.  Got kind of boring since it's pretty much the same thing over and over again. It's p2w, but you can still win without having to pay."
992,not realistic as warthunder but fun
993,"WoT Blitz is pretty entertaining and fun to play for what it is. It's pretty similar to WoT for PC and it's on both PC and Mobile. 
The main differences really show with how it's multiplayer is and it's variations of tanks. There are no Artillery tanks in WoT Blitz like there are in the PC version. i think that's mostly because you can also play this game on your phone as well and I feel like it would be pretty difficult to have a 'bird's eye view' of the match going on and trying to place your shot's with a Artillery tank half way across the map.
  The other noticeable difference is the number of players per match. On the PC version you have 15v15 but in Blitz it's 7v7. Again, i'm pretty sure that is because it's also a mobile game. 15v15 players in a match with people cross playing on Mobile and PC seems a bit crazy. Along with it only being 7v7 per match, Platoons are limited to 2 players. It'd be kinda BS if almost half of the enemy team were in a Platoon together and all using KV-2's or TOG tanks. 
If i remember correctly, the PC WoT can have a Platoon of up to 3 players. Hence the ""almost half of the enemy team"".
  Blitz does feel a lot easier to play and more friendly than the PC version. It's F2P (free to play) and you can get pretty far into the game without having to spend a single penny. 

All in all, it's a great game to have on PC and your phone."
994,I like that is just WOT but no Artillery.

1008,"It is an easy to understand well to do game, would definityl recommend it if you suffer from a laggy or old PC. :D"
1009,"Pay to win game - it's fun for a while but eventually you run into the same crap as you would expect to:

Tanks that you can't do any damage to, teammates that make you wonder how it's legal for people to play this game when they can barely tie their own shoes, accuracy of turrets that make you wonder how / why any nation would ever employ such a tank if it can't reliably hit the broad side of a barn, etc.  Pay gold for each round of premium ammunition that you rarely make on your own (at least you can manually change it to silver for each shot but it's always defaulted to gold for every tank).  That cool looking camo you bought?  It's good for an astoundingly high 4% extra hiding advantage.......wow.....and it COSTS you money after each round win or lose along with all the other tank crew supplies?  Cool, I love losing money for being in the top players of the match, great fun.  You blew up a tank?  Good for you unless you did a significant amount of damage in the match, otherwise it doesn't matter and you get crumbs for XP.  If you can't pierce an enemy's armor due to whatever reason, no decent XP for you no matter how many times you shot (don't forget that each shot costs you money too.  On the plus side, at least people that join a match and go AFK don't get any reward and will only lose money since they won't do any damage, even if their team wins.  If you like the tank you have and are grinding out XP with it but want to use it to buy another tank, if it's not in that SPECIFIC TANK'S progression tree, tough.  The XP you gain is not shared in a character's account, it's specifically only for that tank's progression tree so don't expect to gain a bunch with one tank and use it to buy another even in the same faction's list of tanks unless it's directly related to the one you used (you can grind a million XP with the German's Nashorn <level 6> tank destroyer but you can't use it to purchase a Panther <level 7> because it's in a different bracket).  It's a fun distraction for a little while but as you get to level 7 and above, you really start to notice the unfair balancing more and more (you're lumped in with random people / bots regardless of their skill matched to yours).  If you don't pay real money to this Belarusian company, good luck and have fun going pew pew in a tank that probably shouldn't be in the tier it is.  I suppose a more accurate recommendation would be yes if you don't pay anything and just want to fart around in a tank for a few hours and no if you buy this thinking it will be based upon you skill level and not how much money you want to throw at it."

1011,y
1012,"Very good game, only play if u are true mlg 999"
1013,"This game is decent, and its good for people with potato pc/laptop"
1014,no
1015,Its addicting
1016,"Starter:
I dislike Wargaming's political beliefs, but the game is alright. There are many countries to choose from with a rather wide array of tanks for a game made for mobile devices. 

Graphics:
The graphics are maybe console level at best, which is impressive for a game, again, made for mobile devices. 

Tank Nation options:
From what I remember, the available tank nations are as follows: United States of America, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the British Empire, Canada, Australia (Canada and Australia being very minor nations, with no formal tech tree ingame, but having a few store tanks listed under it), the Japanese Empire, the People's Republic of China (which also has some Taiwanese tanks listed under it, such as the Type-64, and some tanks of the Republic of China. Those include tanks such as American lend-lease, and German lend-lease against their own allies.), the German Reich (although, it does have some post-war West German tanks), the French Third to Fifth Republic, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Sweden, Finland, Italy, and Hybrid Nation (Hybrid Nation consists of fake versions of tanks, like the Girls und Panzer tanks, tanks that are collaborative tanks sometimes, or tanks to some EXTREMELY minor nations like East Germany; the T-55A, which is an East German [GDR/DDR] variation of the Soviet T-55.

Pay-To-Win Issue:
Some people say the game is pay-to-win, but I used to be a free-to-play player for years, and I never really noticed a significant issue with paid tanks. I guess it could be chalked up to people in free tanks either being toxic, or not knowing how to counter these tanks. (Just learn how the tanks fight, and their strengths/weaknesses). (I used to be a free-to-play player, but recently, I've started to give up on free-to play and buy some store tanks. There is, however, some truth to the fact that it  takes forever to grind free tech tree tanks, while you could just pay for in-game recourses and essentially skip a lot of the grind. (But Wargaming is a company, they need to make money. It's not game breaking either, because a lot of these players are not that good.)

Game-Breaking Bugs/Issues:
I haven't found any extremely game breaking issues, besides perhaps the invisible walls everywhere making gameplay very flat and linear on many maps, with only some pre-set elevated hills and buildings existing. Aside from that, there is also a bug that allows extremely light tanks to be glitched into structures and rocks, but I hope that bug stays. (It's fun)

Report System:
I dislike the fact that it is extremely complicated to report players, and needs to be simplified. (Perhaps a system similar to that of Call of Duty's would work.)

Gamemodes:
The game has some normal and very fun modes that are either random, one-time, or planned for a specific week, month, or season. Some of these modes include:
 -Encounter Mode: the default mode where it's Team vs Team and there is a single flag capture point that tanks must either kill all enemy tanks, or capture all base points to win.
 -Supremacy Mode: Encounter Mode, but there are multiple flags and they had a far shorter capture limit and slowly build-up points towards a victory over time.
 -Rating Mode: Essentially the normal modes, but you are paired with players of a similar skill level to you (slightly similar to the ranked battles system of Call of Duty) 
 -Mad Games: which is a gamemode with fun superpowers for the tanks.
 -Uprising: a similar gamemode to Mad Games, but Halloween themed with slightly altered mechanics.
 -Gravity Force: the normal game, but gravity is set to the Moon's, and any tank tier V and over can use a jump boost, except for heavy tanks, as the heavy tank's advantage is their ramming capabilities and their weight.
 -Burning Games: a 'mash-up' of Mad Games and Uprising for Halloween.
 -Boss Mode: a possibly one-time mode with pre-set superpowers (but one team member has the role of the Boss, which gives them a massive health-point boost, the ability to fling nearby tanks, and do a highly damaging shot for one shot, that resets over time.

 -Skirmish Mode: normal gamemode, but on a smaller version of the normal maps with a smaller team."
1017,I enjoy this game
1018,"It's fun; for 3 days
"
1019,"Can be played on 3 screen desktop or mobile phone, on your own or in platoon with a friend, always changing yet the same."
1020,"A fun version of the game. Makes me think of playing tanks with Matchbox cars.  At least at  the lower levels.  You don't need to spend money.  But this thing is $3 or this thing is 99 cents, and you  think, that's not so much.  It can add up.  My older tablet cannot run the game well.  Playing on Steam makes things easier.  Some of the crazy modes , added as special events, can be fun.  Like low gravity and shooting tanks out of the sky.   If you want a serious tank game, maybe try regular WoT or WT.   But if you want some quick games and an arcade feel, try this."

1028,Honestly a great game. Played this for many years. Wish the player base was a little larger.
1029,"I won't recommend this for free players who have rage issue. 

Nice game but it's pay to win, if you're a free player then prepare for the pain rewards, it's hard to earn Credits (free players use this for upgrades) even if you do daily and clan missions. I suggest you to join active clans."

1040,"For playing the game since 2016. I could say that I recommend it for people who have little to no time to play, whether or not on the go or at home. the game just last within seconds or minutes. So Yes I recommend it for people who look for a short game on the go. But if you're willing to lose sanity and your bank account you can play this whenever wherever you are till you lose the will to play. And as well as get S*** talk but someone who have 20% win-rate with a pay2win tank that died 5 seconds into a match. That'll be all"

1063,"With close to 1,800 hours, I've played Blitz since 2016.
In my initial years (what I'd describe as the ""glory days"" of this game), this game was incredibly fun. Had a lot of laughs with friends, and had a great time. However, particularly during 2020-21, I have become increasingly disappointed that this game has moved in the direction of P2W. 

Overall, if you like tanks, and want a simple 7v7 match to play while you're waiting for a bus, or have a bit of free time. Go for it! However there are a lot of things that are being locked behind a paywall in this game. (My friend had to spend $200+ in order to get a Tier X premium...)

Would I recommend it? Yes, as the game can still bring about some hilarious moments, just stay away from all of the lootcrates."
1064,Nice  strategy and just a really fun game you can make your own tactics which is really fun.

just random review bc why not"
1070,"In my teens and early 20's, I played a LOT of COD and Battlefield FPS games. I was better than average. I played a lot of free for all and would place 1st 90% of my games.. But for the last 10 years, I have only been playing MMORPGs such as WoW and Guild Wars 2. Recently I wanted to get back into the FPS games, mostly PUBG and COD: Warzone. I spent a month playing mostly PUBG and some time on 4 other FPS games... I don't know what changed exactly, but man I SUCKED! Everything moves at a much faster pace now than back in COD: MWF2 on PS3 and on PUBG I can't EVER find whos shooting me.. Enemies are the smallest little dot you need supervision to even see.. It's insane.. So... After a month of this, I was very frustrated with FPS games.. But.. One day I'm browsing the store and I came across World of Tanks: Blitz and I love war stuff.. So it sounded pretty awesome! Well.. I'm absolutely loving it!! It's basically like playing an FPS except the enemies are easy to spot! and everyone moves at a slow speed and everyone has slow reload times lol. It's basically an FPS on easy mode! Except there are some unique aspects. Learning your shot angles and how they react to angles of armor and thickness of armor. You can block damage by positioning your tank at the right angles and you can use the terrane and other objects for cover in multiple ways. There is also a completely different strategy involved than in other games. So.. Basically, my bad vision or slow reaction time due to my older age now is not hindering my gameplay here and I'm loving it!! I'm an above-average player for sure. If it didn't rely on teammates so much I would be a top player! But sadly you are only as good as your team is. It's next to impossible to win 1 vs 7 lol. 1v3 would be basically the best you can do solo.. The biggest problem is teammates that just rush into the enemy where 2-6 tanks can shoot them and they’re instantly blown up.. WoT is a game about patience and strategy! Teamwork is by far the best strategy for winning! You need to stick close to teammates and all fire on the same enemies, because, the sooner you can gain the advantage by outnumbering them the sooner you will win with ease! Idiots that just stand in front of each other trading shots is what loses games.. That's just a fight with a LOT of uncontrolled variables making it very random who will win and even if you do win you have next to zero HP left and you instantly get picked off. The trick of this game is to get in as many shots as possible while not getting shot yourself. A great way to do this is when the enemy has all focused on one of your heavy tanks the rest of you should be getting shots off and all on the same target! I’ve seen games where the whole enemy team has ¼ HP left on all 7 tanks because no one actually finished off anyone and they slaughter us. Team up on a single target until it's destroyed! That is the 1 simple rule to winning WoT! Anyways! Love this game! Go play it! And don’t be a noob! :)

1090,"this game is beyond trash everthing is rng based so its unfair, you always get terrible teams or teams that demolish the enemy team."
1091,"After the release of Obj. 268 v4, the best tier 10 tank in the game, which you can only get via gambling with loot-boxes, you can be sure that this game is pay-to-win and is a cash-grab.

Balancing is non-existent, you are incessantly spammed with offers, and the community are all children, not meant for adults. If you play this game, I promise you will spend most of your money on it, and feel too financially invested to quit (even though the game makes you angry, and you aren't even having fun), and continue to spend money. 

The developers for Blitz also completely disregard all player opinions, and only listen to their own ""statistics"", which effectively ruins the game more. Do NOT fall into this trap. Don't download this game. If you want to play World of Tanks, play the PC version, or try War Thunder."

I know I am not the greatest player ever, neither am I the worst, it is just a horrid thing constantly being out tiered. I played 25 matches tonight, was out tiered for 16 of them, lost 17 of them. It is a game I have spent money on, and not a small amount, it kind of begs you to. The nice thing is it is cross platform, but the backgrounds and details suffer for that. I will still play it, but I could never recommend it."

1183,"Pay to win, and massively Pay to progress. The game itself is the true nightmare of Free to play players and anyone with brains.
You can skip roughly 90% of progression in this game by chucking some money at WG. As well as actively purchasing Premium Rounds that in-match, give you a higher chance to penetrate your enemies' armour. So if you're a F2P (either because you don't want to, or simply cannot pay), you will enter nearly every match feeling a sense of unfairness in matches.

Wargaming absolutely loves to advertise their crates, which you can spend your hard earned money on, to quite literally have a 90% chance of getting absolutely nothing - essentially gambling. Pro tip: If you save up gold (the premium currency), do NOT buy crates. You can buy bundles instead, which guarantee you getting a tank, or more.

Wargaming as a whole, are a very money-hungry company, even in other games, such as WoT PC, there is a clear bias against F2P players, as Wargaming simply makes their experience sh*t compared to Paying customers.

Let me clarify: You CAN play this game F2P, you absolutely can reach the higher ranks while being F2P. However, you will constantly be at the mercy of people who are simply rolling around the battlefield in tanks BETTER than yours. You will constantly feel enticed to drop a few bucks to literally be on the same level as the rest of the players. 

If you want to have a better experience in this game, skill will get you quite far, but through a lot of pain and suffering. Paying however, will get you there instantly. Why play for painstakingly long to upgrade your tanks, if you can just pay to have it done instantly? Better yet, just BUY a tank that comes fully upgraded AND earns more Credits per battle!

This game should not be advertised as a F2P game, because it is definitely only around 50-60% F2P. It is a whirlpool of P2W, and if you get sucked in, you probably wont make it out; at least with much money remaining.

The game is frustrating to play. Would not recommend it to any of my friends.

Do I recommend this? It depends:

-Do you have a high rage tolerance?
If yes, go for it.
If no, you're in for some pain.
If no + you're F2P, prepare for the apex of suffering.

-Are you ready to have the fate of all of your shots decided by an RNG?
Yes? Go for it.
No? Turn back now, or get ready to pay some money to WG.

-Are you prepared to deal with the toxic playerbase and wallet warriors?
No? Save yourself the problem of even installing the game.
Yes? Well good luck, remember to carry a hazmat suit.

Not recommended for the weak-minded. Or any-minded, actually.
The amount of suffering I've gone through I would only wish upon my worst enemy."

1206,"After a couple of hours I feel like this game is dead, idk but my 100% win ratio makes me believe that I'm playing against bots all the time."
1207,"I wish there was a ""Mixed"" button on steam. Gameplay is fun, in the later tiers you have to be smart (ish), but let's get the bad out the way first. The problem I have is that they are always putting advertisements in your face. Not popups, but every time you open up the game there are at least 2 different things that I have to close before getting to gameplay. Also, there are these ""deal"" thing were they show a price, discount it, and then give you 10 minutes to get this amount of currency or whatever. 2.99 for 2k gold? not bad, but I don't like the corporateness and scammy nature of it. It does not feel good having them cram all this on you screen every time you open it up, or have that timer looming in the background. Also, they have ""special"" tanks which you an buy with generic ""gold"" which is basically platinum from Warframe or the currency that you pay real money to get. Anyway, the tanks that are special cost a lot, I don't remember the specific prices, but most times 20$ CAD. This, in some ways can be put into the positives, as it discourages pay to win, but those prices just seem so ridiculous you would wonder who even buys it. Also, there is a ""premium account"" option where you get extra research points and silver (silver being the main currency and research points for unlocking better modifications for tanks, or new, better tanks in general), after every battle, they show you how much you got, and the in bigger numbers show you what you could have gotten with premium. ruins the good feeling after doing well and winning in a battle. Like in war Thunder, there is a considerable grind that comes with unlocking the later tanks, though not as bad. so, I need 50k research points for my tier VI or V tank (I don't remember) mos of the time, when I win, I can get, without boosters, around 500 to 800 points of research. If I did exceptionally I can get something like 1k or 1500 points. With boosters, I can get this higher, they aren't rare, but not exactly common either. and it gets worse. For the tier X tanks, it is something like 250k research points to unlock it, with the same gain of research points all throughout the game. And then you have to buy the tank itself. My IS tank costs around 1.3 million silver. To put that is perspective, you an earn about 4k-5k in a good match and n some cases even lose up to 2k from renewing camouflage, repair costs, and all the other miscellaneous expenses. (camo only reduces spotting chance by about 1-2%, not worth it). 

OK time for the good!
It's fun. Kept me coming back. there is an element of strategicness, tank angling, cover, and all that. In the early game, you can run out and shoot anyone you want. In the late game, you will get obliterated if you go into the open or behind enemy lines by yourself. There are some very cool moments, and times where the best option was hard to say, and that is what makes strategy games fun! When you finally get that new tank that you have been staring at on the research screen it really feels good, and speaking on the research screen, there are a lot of tanks you can play. Tank destroyers, Light tanks, Heavy tanks Medium tanks. Imaging how many there would be. in the Soviet one alone, there has to be a good 30 or 40 tanks to play, and each tank class has it's playstyle, disadvantages, and advantages. For example, light tanks are for spotting enemies, which then your entire team can see where they are, and they are fast. But, they have less health and little armour, kind of a support class. Heavy tanks, are slow, and are clunky to maneuver, but have armour galore, and also pack a punch. My KV-1S takes 18 seconds to reload but does 300-400 damage to a target at a time. To put that in perspective, most heavy takes have above 1000hp, the most I have seen would most likely be the TOG-II which has 1550hp, but I have probably seen higher numbers and not paid attention. One last point; sometimes It is hard to say which tank you want to get, after getting enough for one tank, there can be a choice of 2 or 3 tanks to get, each with different pros and cons, and it can be had not knowing how the tank controls and how it preforms overall by just looking at stats.

TL;DR: Great game. Thought out. Strategic, sometimes. Over monetized. Big grind, but rewarding. Pay to win discouraged.
Have a great day."

1237,"It's a great game. I love it. If you can find a friend to play with and a clan you can both be in, it's amazing. It's light, easy to get into, and quick to play. However, there is a definite grind, especially starting at class IV or V. It's not balanced , especially at the higher levels, again. Overall, great fun, especially for a cross-platform, free mobile game. Worth a try, certainly. If you find you love it, stick around. If not, it's absolutely understandable."

1239,Very Fun Game
1240,Realy awesome game! I recommend (played that game on mobile too).
1241,If you have low end pc but you want to Play tank game then go for it....

1249,"No 1 pay2loose game :) Download if you want to suffer. Also good for wasting money into useless crates. Grind 2 hours for 1 crate and get 10 common credit boosters and 100.000 credits.

Edit: The new aiming system made the game even worse - thanks for nothing i am quitting."
1250,do yourself a favor and go play war thunder
1251,"[spoiler]50,01%+[/spoiler]/💯"
1252,yes
1253,nice gameplay but u need to grind ur ass off to get to tier 10
1254,"Fun, don't need to spend money to be good,but I'm a tryhard and thus don't have fun if my stats don't go up. Also, you learn Spanish in this game! I learned pendejo means stupid! Duolingo doesn't teach you this stuff! 10/10 fun for a free to play game if you're not a tryhard, and a fun Spanish learning game. Also add me as a friend, I'm Shacka_coddle."
1255,"U doesn't have any braincells left?
Go play this game"
1256,good game  pretty deep
1257,"This game is really fun and I totally recommend you to give it a try.
I've played many hours classic World of Tanks but this game is much more fun than the original one in terms of action. Original WoT is much harder to understand and control than Blitz. WotB is more like arcade and that's better in my opinion.
You can play it on both PC and mobile, but I prefer PC (aiming with mouse is better).
The only bad side of the game is matchmaking - simetimes you get stupid teammates but that's normal in almost every other game.

Please don't get confused by some people that this game is Pay To Win. It's not true. Premium tanks are not better than the classic ones. And other benefits from donating are focused on faster grinding, so there is no reason to hate this game.

So, if you like tanks and you're looking for relaxing game, this one is for you."
1258,very epic and proooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
1259,Made me almost kill myself
1260,"good game with lots of tanks and many maps combined with amazing graphics.
"
1261,fun and chaotic
1262,"The game is great, don't expect it to be mercy to you all the time though."
1263,can't believe skin of the tank .
1264,asssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
1265,World of Tanks simple version.
1266,Tanks go brrrr
1267,"its unbalance,expensive,p2w at least the ""training room"" people are chill sometime"
1268,This is a fun game. It uses strategy to win
1269,"Hard to believe I've played this long; 5,549 hrs!   But it is fun, and I've made quite a few good friends via clan and Discord.   I've been a fan of tank games since I was a kid.  The first was an arcade game in the mid-70's that was the main reason I went to the bowling alley with my friends.  Lotsa quarters in that unit until we learned to hack it with a fingernail clipper.  :)
   Anyway, the Blitz graphics and stability are constantly improving and management seems adequately responsive to player concerns.  Maybe another 5,000 hours in my future.  :)"
1270,"Great game, a lot of content to grind. The game has it's issues such as playing f2p is significantly harder but if you do put in the effort you won't see much of a difference from my experience. Now of course this game has some overpowered tanks, but as long as you play to their weakness and your strengths it's always possible to come out on top. I recommend this game if you are dedicated to it."
1271,yes
1272,tanks tanks tanks
1273,"Эта игра очень класная, играл и на пк и на телефоне 
Пока играл ко мне приходили накачаные волосатые мужики, я в них спросил кто они они сказали что они мои отчимы и к 30 часам игры они начали меня еб**ь
Одобряю"
1274,Great game until your account gets screwed up and there is no SUPPORT!
1275,"gud game
"
1276,"Quite a fun game to play, however, the difficulty of damaging modules often makes damaging them a moot point when it is very cheap to fully repair all debuffs immediately."
1277,"Great Game honestly, On russian servers they have more game modes than North american Servers I recommend  this game!"
1278,its very good game but you need many hours
1279,Good game.
1280,"Simple easy game. Play a few rounds and have fun. Just ignore the constant bating to get this and get that. Or go hardcore and grind till it hurts, Your choice."
1281,"I like it a lot, is good :)"
1282,Отличная игра чтобы вдонатить зарплату и разочароваться в жизни
1283,"good
"
1284,I played just 18 hours and already have two tanks 7 tier without any donate. It's T29 and Comet. Game is surprisingly addictive and well balanced. The best advantage of WoT Blitz is a fact that I can play it on my mid tier mobile phone with smooth 60 FPS and it's really comfortable
1285,It is an all around good game
1286,Good fast paced action. Alot of fun.
1287,"Very Fun and versatile, but needs to allow more players in a platoon"
1288,"I think its a fantastic game, but I periodically have to uninstall and reinstall because of growing time delay in controlling my tanks.  If someone could give me a fix for that I would be even happier playing."
1289,Best game ever I would never quit playing
1290,"Boom, boom, Kaboom"
1291,I play on mobile :))
1292,"Perfect game. All working correctly without any of errors. For my opinion, this game is the ""second breath"" of world of tanks."
1293,Great game easy yo learn and to have fun!
1294,epic
1295,"This game is about the worst and most disastrous tank game I've ever played. I came here from War Thunder expecting something along the lines of decent matches, but that wasn't the case. Everyone I played against was about the stupidest person I've ever played against. I have no clue what on earth these developers were thinking, but clearly they should take another look at this game and see how bad it is/has gotten. I do not recommend that you play this and go play the regular World of Tanks or War Thunder instead."
1296,mind-numbingly predictable with salty entertainment
1297,"finally a good game from wargaming, it is balanced till some point but pretty harsh against new and free to play players."
1298,GOOD
1299,Good game for a while then you quickly need to pay to play or you will never have a chance against those who do.
1300,"game play and the fast pace more missions in less time
"
1301,So as a Beta player and at times I have to head out of town and the Main PC WoT account is not coming in without lag I love to fire up the Blitz and run a few for therapy and smiles.
1302,excellent game
1303,"best game ever, feels great to donate my money here"
1304,"fun. good port. bad teammates, unless you want to go through pain... just go for the normal wot not this"
1305,"This is how WOT for PC should be ,you can't have a credits problem in WOT Blitz"
1306,ez game
1307,good
1308,it is good game
1309,In half the times of game someone is sitting AFK entire the game
1310,"If you like fighting against a biased matchmaker, go right ahead. Unless you pay to win, you will not go above 51% winrate. when you reach 51%, you will be put with bots that will force you to loose. there is nothing you can do about this but grind through till you hit 48% winrate, then you *might* be allowed back into a fair game."
1311,"Great game for killing time. Don't rage people, it's just a game."
1312,"Než jsem to hrál, měl jsem malý penis, žádnou přítelkyni a žádnou vůli žít. Žádná z těchto věcí se nezměnila, ale hra je docela dobrá."

1314,Better than world of tanks :D

1318,If you are a tanker or ex-tanker or armor enthusiast...you will love this game!
1319,I used to play this a lot on mobile so playing it now on pc feels weird but i love it
1320,I enjoy this game. It functions well on a computer (I have trouble with the controls on a phone. If you play regular World of Tanks. Battles are smaller (only 1/2 as many tanks at a time) less tanks however some are totally fictional (from games and such). The game shows you the weak points when you look based on the round in your gun.

1327,"WoTB is the little brother of WoT PC. Originally a mobile-only title, the steam version offers what I think is the best way to play this game. A great time consumer with an enjoyable grind that isn't as hard as it's big brother, but also not a breeze.

Things to keep in mind:
This is an arcade style game, not a realistic battle simulator. Go to War Thunder for more of that.
This is also not completely historically accurate, so if you want something purely history based... good luck.
There are a lot of paying elements to this game. Not always P2W, but premium account, gold, and premium tanks are a thing that all cost money. Luckily, they aren't necessary to have a good time.

If you can live with that, give it a try. I mean, it is free after all..."
1328,Quick battle is very efficient.
1329,Pretty cool old school game.  Anyone can play at different levels and with various tanks.
1330,so very good for humans tanks

1335,Very fun game iv had 2 years of grinding but now iv got it on steam so im now a PC player. But there is better gameplay on PC then mobile for all of u Pc players that might have never played WOTB on mobile
1336,"I rate this game a 4.5/5. The .5 gone because of the players that yell at the team saying they don't know how to play the game while the person yelling has a 35% win rate and did no damage the whole battle whatsoever. Enjoy the game, its very accurate and fun without the salty people though."
1337,fun action and quick turnaround to the next match.
1338,"I like the fast games, the strategic nature of having 7 v 7 with all the different tanks and maps, and I like the community (Meadsy69, HisRoyalFatness, Droodles, and many more). I've been playing for 5 years and the game still is interesting to me and a great diversion."

1368,This game a tank game where you need to upgrade your tank and play some battles with other players but dont be toxic beacuse there are ratings if you are polite to other players then you get a good rating ad if you are not then you know what happens (there are no ban in this game)

1372,"If I was born without limbs, maybe I'd enjoy this game. Disney Plus fans might enjoy this, seeing as they are mostly retarded."
1373,much easier to play than wot
1374,"In principle, this game has quiet some potential. Nevertheless, it is the most frustrating game I have ever played. There are several factors that render this game unsuitable for anyone who is looking for a well-balanced PVP experience where your individual skill can actually decide over victory or loss.

1) The abyssal ""match making"" is a catastrophy for any serious competitiveness, because the player skill is not taken into account. And not even the claimed balancing on tier and class of tanks works due to obviously overpowerd tanks. So be prepared for:
	- lopsided games, where one team gets completly wrecked, 
	- team mates that struggle with base principles, not to ask for strategic playing,
	- harsh changes in win rate on a daily basis (e.g., one day 75%, the next merely 40%),
	- facing higher tier tanks in ~75% of the matches, although WG claims that the ""match maker"" works randomly and everyone has the same chances. What a coincidance that statistic web-sites like blitzstars.com don't provide insight in this regard.
2) There is way too much randomness involved in the game mechanics. Expect your shots to go anywhere but not where you aimed or even to disappear. Expect troll bounces and miraculous track hits. Expect low damage rolls in the most unfavorable sitatutions, and much more funny stuff.
3) Pay-To-Win, tough this may be much worse in other games. But fighting overpowered (premium) tanks is always a pain.

In summary, if you dont care about the mentioned flaws and look for a casual game then you might give it a try. If you want a skilled-based PVP game then dont waste your time, avoid a lot of frustration and dont let the game punish you for playing it!"
1375,hell
1376,its an amazing game and if i could i would rate it 1M+/10 stars
1377,good game
1378,
1379,"quick play
"
1380,I Really like game. wot blitz is for mobile users or for someone who had a low spec pc like me and the battles are like 7 mins long if you kill everyone or cap the base is like 3-4 mins. I really recommend the game if someone want to play arcade. I play World of Tanks from 2013 and I love the game.
1381,"good game, bad dev and matchmaking

pretty much p2w

stay out of asia/apac server

and ffs dont camp with anything other than TDs"

1388,Tanks
1389,"The balance of this game is tilted to pay to win. If you are not going to spend real money to buy good rounds, you have to accept their are several tanks in your tier and the higher tier you will be paired against that you just cannot penetrate their armor"
1390,no
1391,IT IS TANK WAR WHAT ELSE TO SAY!

1400,GREAT GAME TO UNWIND WITH ALSO MEET NEW FREINDS
1401,"Great game although teammates can be a pain. 

Key differences from other ports:
No Artillery,
Faster games,
Faster tank progression,
Better clan mechanics.
Less tanks in tech tree but most missing tanks available as collectables.

Don't buy loot crates you won't get anything good!"
1402,Excellent game
1403,GOOD STUFF
1404,"World of Tanks Blitz is a fun game. It can be played without paying, but with a little money you can get better tanks and be more successful. It is not perfect. They are working on making it better. Recommended."
1405,"This Is The Lite Version Of World Of Tanks

If you are the new player or veteran at world of tanks this is the one this conclude also crap pc this one same as the original wot but not much tank goin around so if you have crap pc play this"
1406,"The game is going downhill.  Never F2P except your 1st five tanks then it's all down hill from there.  Matchmaking in this game is horrendous.  Buggy monthly updates.  Toxic players.  No matter how hard you learn to play the takes well and get their ""super unicorn"" WN8 you will still lose because of the matchmaking.  You can't carry a whole team of players that didn't take the time to learn how to play."

1423,definately the best game
1424,Wotb is a really fun game. Invite friends to play to make even better. It's really fun when you ammo rack a kid that has full health and was talking trash.     Best thing ever lol.

1434,"The pay 2 win is annoying, especially at tier 7, 8 and 10, but the game is fun nonetheless.
Filled with pro players and complete morons, it allows you to determine which you are.
Different vehicle types also allow for different gameplays and strategies, and can be super rewarding or endlessly painful.
I'd recommend it to anyone who's enough of a masochist to like grinding to this extent, and is interested in an arcade version of War Thunder.
Have fun -or not- !"

1442,Its an awsome game recomended but its kinda p2w/not p2w
1443,I love this game it just makes me rage sometimes hahaha. For any others wanting to play this game its a slow paced Third person shooter with your scope of corse you can zoom in tho first person.
1444,Need skill and patience
1445,fun
1446,nice
1447,"Decent alternatives for wot on mobile, although the game itself is kinda p2w (chimera, smasher, etc). The community is kinda toxic if you doesn't perform well on the matches and the graphic itself is okay for a pc and mobile game. It took me months to grind tier 10, so you will need to spend a lot of time on this game in order to get the top tier tanks. Customization wise, you can equip camouflages (lots of choice) on your desired tank. The matchmaking is okay-ish from my perspective, although sometimes it will give you bad teammates that camp with the E 100. I was kinda disappointed when the 5.5 update come, many tanks were removed from the tech tree and recycled on the battle pass. It also has various events that come with cool rewards, but to get the good one you will need to grind hours or buy your way out. Better when played with friends and the MS-1 is goat."
1448,"good game, only kinda pay2win and bad teams
otherwise good graphics and good gameplay"
1449,"cool game, stuck tier 8
"
1450,This is a great game although sometimes matchmaking can be off
1451,"My dad has been playing this game since i introduced him to it and I'm just happy to see him play his favorite game again (albeit, a much more small-scaled version of the game). 
He's been playing the OG world of tanks for about 6 to 7 years at this point. At some point in time, he lost interest. When he played blitz, he regained that lost interest just mere minutes after playing the game. Seeing his face light up after the game finished downloading was heartwarming.

I wouldn't even play this game and sink this many hours into it if it weren't for my dad inviting me to his platoon every time he plays. Honestly, my dad playing this game made me find my lost interest in the game.

Highly recommended if you just want to play a quick 5 to 10 minute tank battle. 9/10"
1452,I really recommend to people who love tanks and have a hobby of playing with tanks i like it because of the variety of tanks there is too choose
1453,Great  graphics and sound.  Historical tanks which I enjoy to see and play.  Difficult to win on a regular  basis.
1454,"very nice for low end pcs but if you have a gameing pc get world of tanks normal not blitz

It is not something like pay to have and pay to play. Every tank will be opened but for higher rank tanks you should grind. There are some additional options like Premium Account, Free XP and gold but none of them is required to unlock higher tanks if you aren't in hurry. Just be patient and play the game. Enjoy it. I recommend it."
1475,Pritty good game. Not too hard to grind the tanks.
1476,I love the graphics
1477,this game is awesome and the kills dont get me started ok it is awesome it is fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1478,Golden tanks are incredibly overpowered both in armor and damage. Normal tanks are nothing compared to them.
1479,tanks
1480,garbage like all wargaming games
1481,WOT is a great game only if you cant get to the higher % in win's. Almost every match up is very one sided and your team is wiped out within 2 to 3 minutes tops. There is NO balance to the teams as far as HP and armor. After month's the play is 1 out of 10 battles or 2 to 3 of fifteen wins per. It's beyond madness to play for long this way and to have fun.
1482,The game is getting worse with every time they bring a new tank
1483,become wargaming's b*$#@

1502,"Easy to play very fun and competitive game-play, for Mobile and PC players alike.
"
1503,"The game is cool and fun to play. I hope the game will continue until the end of the world, lol"
1504,"Played with my friend, fun game. However, go play war thunder instead if you play alone

My complains are that it gets boring real fast, you can only use one tank per match, the repairs are insane, research takes forever and personally, I don't think its a accurate representation of tank combat

Don't get me wrong, tank combat is much much more complicated than just hover mouse to left,click and boom. But, it just doesn't make sense to me. Why can't my 17 pounder pen a tiger frontally without shooting it at the lower part, why is my Churchill reversing at breakneck speed and why is damage determined by rng.

I only play this game  with my friend since we both like tank combat a lot and I prefer this game if you have a buddy to game with, but alone however you should just avoid it. I don't wanna sound like a gaijin shill, but I prefer War thunder more than this game (it's addicting just like WOTB, but atleast there's planes and decent graphics soooo that's something :D)

So verdict: Avoid this game if you don't have a friend to pair up with you"

1522,"Fun game a lot of grinding to do when your mid or late game. Beside that lots of fun, I know its not the more realistic version but in my opinion its more better/ Probably a lot will disagree cause its not realistic and better but I like it for my self. Also they need to add more Classes. Don't have many hours but I enjoy it."
1523,Excellent game. In my view its better to delay my approach to the flag and take a position I feel is well suited to zoom and shoot at other tanks. You have to be aware of what is near or around you so you don't get hit without having an exit plan. If you are the only one left its better to run frequently and hide to take shots...best of luck.
1524,it is fun
1525,"bad matchmaking,,,,,, total bot players playing

1527,"BRING BACK HETZER DERP, BRING BACK KV2 PEN, BRING BACK ALL THE HIGH ALPHA GUN NERFS. HORRIBLE GAME, 1/10, i still recommend because I have crippling depression."
1528,"Fast, fun, and overall enjoyable. I thoroughly enjoy playing with tanks that have true historic meaning. But I really love playing with the original tanks. The unique designs and play style make them fun. The new game modes are also very enjoyable."
1529,"quick games, tactical games, lots of depth"
1530,love this game.
1531,yes
1532,"I play on PC only, very easy to jump in and play a few matches to relax your mind.

I don't pay to play, but there is enough reward content to keep you coming back and working toward upgrading or earning new tanks.

If you can complete the daily/weekly missions you will earn temporary premium account status, which results in higher combat XP and payouts for each match.  This really adds up quickly to upgrade modules and purchase optional equipment.

Some aspects could be improved, especially around the matchmaking.  I had a 64-65% K/D when I purchased my first tier 8 tank, then I hit a wall and it's been a grind ever since.  You will get tiered up based on your experience.  This is great until your team gets crushed and you see that the average battle count on your team is less than 2000 battles while the average for the enemy is 14-15k battles.  After you lose a few like this then will drop back down to where you're playing against players with similar experience.  Then you will win a few and the cycle starts over.  Your mileage may vary, I had an win streak of 40:1 immediately before I started experiencing this, so the matchmaking algorithm might struggle in my case.  My experience with this is basically the same when playing alone or platooning with clanmates.

One thing I really enjoy is being able to platoon with my young son as a Friday night or weekend treat.  He plays on Switch and/or iPad, and the cross-platform implementation is really smooth.

Of course, you will also have random matches where multiple teammates go AFK and either don't leave the spawn or quit as soon as they get hit by the enemy.  I suspect this is part of the cross-platform aspect and people just killing time on their phones during their morning commute.  This can't be blamed on WG, but is something that happens pretty frequently depending on time of day.

TLDR: Overall a pretty good game if you like FPS, tanks in general, or have studied military combat tactics.  The graphics are pretty good, could be better but no specific complaints or downfalls to speak of.  I have a backlog of many purchased 2017+ games, but keep coming back to this."
1533,Great interactive game that can keep you busy for hours. Love it.
1534,Play this game for eternal suffering
1535,"The size of the game is 3 GB, but it has good quality and tanks can be customized."
1536,wii play tanks are better wtf
1537,Historical tanks and easy combat format.
1538,xsx
1539,"if you enjoy being shot thru rocks or bunkers or when you shoot a tank that is standing still then disappears as you pull the trigger and get nothing if a hit or miss or out of 12 shots 10 are ricochets no matter where you aim at tank front or back or AT TRACKS ........ well that disappointment has your name written all over it !
UPDATE: so developers do read these and are petty .... seems like any tank i now do play has been nerfed to do no damage and my radar map wont let me see enemy tanks anymore.
glad i only payed $5 for this which is a shame cuz the other game i do have by them is cool but now i'm afraid to see what got jacked there.
update 2: whats the point of armor piercing rounds if they just bounce, now its been 9 out of 10 shoots fired, these developers have no idea how weapons work, maybe do some research ehhh?
"
1540,"Stupid game i just clicked ""alt-f4"" for the boosters.... the game is trolling :p

so just waited like 75 min in a tier 2 tank without getting in a match... really i know you have bots in the game just add them to the game when it exceeds 1 min i dont care if my team gonna fck me up (they do it even if they were players) however just try to have the same amounts of bots on each team and it would be fine.... i mean you cant play this if you dont have tier 6-10 tanks now so no new players will ever get to play this.... however i still recommend this cause its a fun and fast paced game compared to the PC version which is just too slow and grinding but please fix this since you dont have a high enough player base"

1542,"games great 
"
1543,"I recommend this game because: Real tanks,Online gameplay,Sooo many ways to have fun! Me and all my freinds  pretty much play this game and we like it! ANother reason is how you get to customize your tanks and get new guns,engines,turrets,tracks etc."
1544,yes
1545,"It's like the regular WOT; just the matches are faster, the tech trees are simpler, and the game overall is a bit easier.  If you like WOT but don't have the time to invest in the game, WOT Blitz is for you."
1546,Im really enjoy this game
1547,"YES, its the best tank game out there but owned by the greediest and most manipulative company in the history of video games.
If you plan to download this game and plan to spend money to buy premium or rare tanks, please do not spend real cash or game gold on boxes, just buy the rare tanks when they offer them with discounts and avoid ""gambling"" on premium tanks offered in boxes like I did, I have lost a lot of money gambling on ""tanks boxes"" and got boosters and other junk in return because this greedy company wants me to spend more until I open the ""right box"" with the desirable premium tank. I haven't spent a penny every since on this game and will not recommend it until they stop scamming players with their premium tanks boxes."

1575,love the game WoT! It's really amazing. 🔥
1576,"Garbage matchmaking, always got a team full of ""Special"" need folk that doesnt even know how to play this game that do nothing but messing the team im in, while the enemy always got the pro who knows the inner working of this game to the teeth.

not worth a single brain cell or effort to play this game until this MM is fixed. which is not gonna happened for a while"
1577,"Really good game 
would be better if you could test drive tanks before you get them so that you know what to expect. but other wise great game and would  recommend it."
1578,my wife left me
1579,A great game that is competitive and requires lots of tactics and thinking along with tank knowledge to play. There are a few kinks with toxicity like players every now and then sabotaging with no consequences to their actions. Other than that extremely fun grind to upgrade and collect all tanks.
1580,บอทเล่นโง่เกินไป
1581,"Hours of fun blasting the enemy, with your friends and teammates."
1582,yes
1583,"A less complicated version of World of Tanks. So many free stuff thrown your way from the developers, making grinding tanks far easier and enjoyable. Crew training far simpler and skills like 6th sense is available to everyone instead of needed to be grinded. If you want to play World of Tanks but hate the over complexity and micro management, then this is for you."
1584,Buy gold and get op tanks and win or just grind away for years and become a strong player..

Bir gün karşıma çıktı WoTB denemek amacı ile indirdim fakat denemek ile kalmadım bayıldım. WoT PC ye göre çok çok daha az P2W. Oyun bedava çok fazla şey veriyor. Grafikler ve bağzı minor mekanikleri WoT PC ye göre daha geride ama geri kalan her konuda WoT PC ile denk ya da daha ileride. Herkese tavsiye ederim!!"

1593,"It was fun when it was on it's peak: new exciting tanks, entirely new mechanics like drum magazine tanks, amazing events and super engaging clan wars, map pool wasn't filled with same looking locations, legendary historical tanks (Like T-34, Tiger, Panther, M4 Sherman) were actually good AND fun to play. Now low tier matches are filled with needless premium tanks, mid and high tier matches are just nightmare because of tank destroyers with RIDICILOUS amount of damage and penetration, nevermind the gamesense of an average player plummeting significantly. 
Overall: if you want to have a quick laugh and maybe you're in just the right mood to play a tank simulator while being drunk of high - then yeah, get yourself a KV-2 or FV 215b 183 and just die after making 1 kill. But it's not what i remember it being back in 2015 when i had hundreads of hours put on my iPad. It's toxic, unfun, ridicilously expensive to progress and is filled with abnoxious tanks that will make your life misrable whether you're driving it or being driven over by it.

I love the new game modes, not to mention that the game is free and not pay to win, you can get premium tanks for free(getting 4-7 day premium access).

1608,"I've played World of Tanks on pc for 10+ years. The rng sucks on the pc however, I started playing blitz just to try out the rng. At first, it was all good but once I bought the S. Conq prem my rng went to crap. I low rolled for 207 dmg btw THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE! The lowest that it can go is 300. How the crap did I low roll for 207 dmg? At tier ten too if I might add. Every team I got on were complete crap is it kept on getting worse. If rng isn't rigged then the math behind rng that's within this game. Is so flawed, that it needs to be fixed how did I kept on low rolling for less then 300 dmg. When that's not even possible according to War Gaming. Don't play this game I wasted 30$ on this game & I would recommend you to find some other game. Or just stop playing games altogether & find the Lord Jesus Christ & just enjoy life."

1644,"yes
"
1645,"I've grown addicted to this game, but I can't recommend it. It could really be great, but it can be so frustrating and punishing that I'd recommend others to stay away. The fundamental issue with it is that you're always matched with 6 randos, who could be good or bad, and however good you get, whether you win or lose will be determined much more by those randos than by you. Yes you can platoon with someone you know is OK, but that just means 5 randos rather than 6. As far as I can tell the game makes no effort to match the player win-rate between opposing teams. Add to that the mixing of 2 tiers within the same team, putting lower tier tanks at a huge disadvantage (and for some reason I'm much more often in the lower tier than the higher, which makes no sense statistically, so there's probably some sort of favoring of some players going on), and you can see how frustrating it can get. Plus the so-called ""rating"" system is so flawed that it's a complete joke, your rating depends 90% on whether your team happens to win or not, not on how good you or useful you are. It would be so easy to fix all of this but it's just not happening, so am very close to cutting my addiction cold turkey..."
1646,.
1647,"This game is a complete sh#t, biggest pay2win game i've ever seen, matchmaking 1/10, broken tier VII, X collector tanks, community is a complete disaster, racists, there will be atleast 1 player in your team who rage quits, if you play alone DON'T try to have a good WR (win rate) unless you play in platoon, because your team prbbly 70% of battles are trash and you win by luck or just by carrying them. Also, i've met some russian guy in regular battle who said ""F, R4P3 ALL UKRAINIAN SL@TS"" - yep u read it right, this type of players you can bump into very very often, why i mention that? I responded to that guy that i support ukraine and i'm with human rights without using any swearing words, guess what, i got a chat ban for 1 week. I looked more into it, started discussions with other players, and in conclusion - i'm not alone who got a chat ban from WG. So think again if u want to download this game, and if u do, DO NOT THINK ABOUT SPENDING 0.0000001 Cent on this. They have a nice system working there, this game is a complete grind, and if u play without spending any $ u will get bored very fast. Make a screenshot and print it, put it over your laptop or monitor and everytime u get an idea ""mby i should buy this"" read my words 3 times loud and 50 more times in your head."
1648,"Well, yes... only if you have self-control and want no friends"
1649,"Nahhh... 
-Nerfing tech tree tanks so that the premium counterpart would be better?
-Broken and Overpowered tanks on tier 7 and below crushes newbies, especially stock tanks.
-There are Tier X tanks that can be bought directly in the store, newbies who didn't play the game goes to tier 10 causing toxicity in battle.

1650,"A lot of paid content, but you could play even without it"
1651,mmk
1652,Watch a youtube video in this game that should be good enough   xD
1653,"Out of 5 I'd give this a 4/5 rating because I find this game is the most balanced of the 3 versions of World of Tanks and I've been playing the Xbox version for 5 years and the pc one for 1 year. 
I like how in this game a tanks armour means so much more. For example in the other games I've witnessed tanks with good armour get penned like crazy even if the shells their being hit with shouldn't pen their armour while in here you have a good gist of what you can pen and what you can't because I find the shell pen rng is a lot tighter on this one. Plus a lot of guns that should do good damage for their size and long reloads do mediocre damage on the other games while on here those same guns hit much harder giving you a good reason for your long reload. 

The only real complaint I have for this is if you don't have any friends to play with on here you more or less screwed 70% of the time. here's how most teams act in this game I've noticed: 
1. They hate basic tactics and rather randomly drive around the map.
2. As soon as the first enemy is spotted 80% of your team while dog pile that 1 tank leaving multiple objectives defenceless and leaving any team mate defending a point alone to get killed by 2 - 3 enemy tanks that show up.

My main argument is don't trust your team at all. seriously they act like ants in a hive mind for some reason not even a smart hive mind just a low IQ hive mind that likes getting flanked a lot.

It's not a bad game especially for a mobile based game just has some of the worst team mates I've ever seen in any game. Ever."

1659,"For me, WOT Blitz is a much more digestible, fun experience than the original World of Tanks. Battles are short enough that you can jump in and jump out; and there is enough tactics and teamwork needed to make things interesting. There is some grinding to be done, but it isn't pay to win."

1666,"This game is alright if you're interested strictly in the gameplay itself, but it is not worth it to be chatting with others, since the playerbase is absolutely terrible. I'd recommend turning chat off entirely if you want to play this game. Other than the playerbase issue, the actual game itself is pretty good. It's reasonably accurate with the tanks, but sometimes you just get some very weird bounces or hits.
All in all, good game ; would recommend for gameplay only."

1668,Nice game
1669,"All in all, World of Tanks is a ruthlessly addictive game, unique and confident in its place in the free-to-play world, this team-based MMO is a surefire winner, balancing fun with depth and detail with action.

This is by far the best free to play MMO out there at the moment. Its well polished, with good sound effects, well detailed tanks and terrain and regular updates and map.

The number of times I've lost because of garbage teammates is ridiculous. Slowly watching my 55% WR after 12k battles go down because this game thinks I need to carry every MF team to win. Game screwed itself when they eliminated 90% of their low tier tanks so that new players could access high tiers faster. Now you're seeing more and more idiots at max level. When you've lost ten times in a row and you're the top player each time, there's a problem. Thanks WG, I feel saltier than the bottom of a bag of french fries."
1674,"one thing all the tanks are good but maybe the Pudel should have a little more armor like instead of 70 for hull why not 72 or 75 like a panther 1.
can the tanks be alot cheaper so people don't have to spend so much money just to have one tank from the tec trees i think a tier 8 should be 1 million a tier 9 1.7-2 million a tier 10 2-3.5 million this would also make the game a little more far and less of a money pit
i am a 8 year player on the X-Box vertion and this game could live up to that title if it was fun to play grinding inproves skills yes but why not make it like a mobile game tanks aren't to expencive and its more fun to play
and every one complains that the game sucks i dont i think it just needs time to work out the bugs and the thing people cry about i'm not asking much more then any thing i want to see the tanks go from 6.9 million to a ressonable price tec tree mainly prem tanks can stay at their prices they arent what i want 
so please can you make the tec tree tanks tier 9-10 a little cheaper
i do see this game living up to its name i get it it takes time thats all the game needs is time
i hope this suggestion sparks something 
more then ever this is a fun game to play
:) can't wait to see what this game can be in the newer updates

1675,I like the game play and the fact thet you can have a strategy that can work... and not work the next time.. have to keep ypour eyes open..  I really hate the slow aqusition of XP and coin... I do not buy just to upgrade. its way to expensive..  so I just go with what I earn.
1676,good
1677,Ive never played a game so infuriating. Worst matchmaking of any game ive ever play. Every single match always 1 guys thats AFK to start the match. You have guys so bad on your team with 30k+ games played doing 400 dmg on 8 shots fired. How is that even possible? I cant recommend this game to anyone just awful just stay away save yourself the aggravation. And b4 people say you should just get good my wn8 is 2746 and wn7 1695. So i aint bad at the game the problem is getting teamed up with the worst players ive ever seen.

1778,"Great fun chugging through a rather poorly done Stalingrad in an excellently modelled T35 with all 5 turrets revolving beautifully and a plentiful supply of German A.F.V.'s to blast away at. It's definitely arcade, and some of the English lingo is a bit butchered. It's cheap, I encountered no bugs .Okay the buildings are bloody awful ,but it's grand fun to play for half an hour or so and the A.F.V.'s do look well. So yes recommended."

1787,"I quit. I came back for 2 months after reading some suggestions by others. And I quit again. This time...I really quit. My suggestion is not to play this game, at all.

There's very little depth to this game, and there are just some things about this game that don't add up and you will see them and become frustrated by them if you are a player that cares about W/L at all. 

free to play... pay to win, and over all a lackluster and uninspired product. 

Unfortunately if this game was ever great, it certainly is no longer.  If you like tanks and want to play this game, I personally suggest maybe to level 5 tanks and stop there. At levels 4 and 5, effectively you will have seen all this game has to offer, You can experience the 4 different tank types. I suggest not spending any $$$ on this game. It will be tempting, they got $65 out of me between 1 gold purchase and 3 ""passes"". 

Instead of paying $$$$, use the mobile ap even if you play on PC, to get the 50 daily gold, 1000 free XP mission, and container ad (in the store in the containers) and just do the missions. 

[u][b]Thanks...I'll pass[/b][/u]
There's 3 levels of passes. The basic level (free to play) allows you do missions and collect rewards. Then there's the upgrade to that which increases things like XP you earn from battles. Normally, this can be obtained for free but also can be purchased. The 3rd level has to do with ""events"" which are roughly 30 day periods of time which have extra rewards for completing missions, these passes must be purchased.

[u][b]Clans[/b][/u]
There is a clan system built into WOTB, and I suggest taking advantage of joining clans for extra rewards and comradary. Where the troubles begin is the communication system is horrible. Basically you can tell if your friends or clan mates are online but nothing else. You can't tell if they are in a platoon, or in battle. So you send an invite, or receive one. Several times I've been in battle and received invites and then have the person cancel it, only to later tell the person ""I was in a battle"". 

[u] [b] Most Profitable[/b] [/u]
Yeah, for WarGaming. Just remember any time you see ""Most Profitable"" remember it is not for you, it is for them. I'm sure there are 100s and maybe even thousands of players that have spent $100s if not $1000s on this game. With all the ""chance"" purchase I can imagine people spending $10-20 frequently just hoping to get that 3% chance uber tank instead they get some stupid avatar.

Far too much focus on spending. Nearly EVERY aspect of this game is to try to get you to open your wallet for SOMETHING and it comes in the small bits here and there that no doubt add up to big profits for them. I would rather just pay the $50 fee for the game, like most games and be done with it. Instead, they have created a system to (IMO) bilk every dollar they can out of you in dozens of pretty sketchy ways (like buying containers for ""random"" rewards). 

[b][u]All's Not Fair in Love and War[/u][/b]
Beyond tier 3 or 4, team equality starts becoming dependent on the team you ""randomly"" are assigned each battle. The effort required to acquire higher level tanks, outfit them with resources, train the crew, etc. can have an undesirable outcome especially if for whatever reason you find yourself consistently ""randomly"" being paired with, bad players, bad team mates, or something.

The variety of battle types (encounter, supremacy, skirmish, big boss) all essentially boil down to being some sort of deathmatch/sudden death battle. Basically you get no valuable XP or points for capturing a base. Very few matches come down to a team actually attempting to capture the base. I would say even, in Supremacy mode we often wait until the count hits 1000 to get the last tank kill, you can become quite effective at this and you certainly can tell others do to. 

[u][b]If it ain't broken don't fix it...IT'S BROKED[/b][/u]
So much is broken in this game. There are ""ghost"" shots, disappearing tanks (even if a tank hides, it is still there and my round should hit it even if I can't see it), which always seem to effect me at the worst times either I needed that damage on someone but they nick the corner of my fender armor and knock 300hp off my tank. I have shots fired apparently stopped by bushes, but my enemies have no problems damaging me through train cars. Sometimes I don't get all the ""daily"" missions so I can't get the full rewards, and sometimes I have had it where missions are not counting towards completion."

When you'll find this game boring and you'll find that it looks like Duplo bricks, turn your devotion to Word Of Tanks.

People can easily get into high tier tanks with 0 experience, 0 games, 0 skill and it ruins the experience. I have to pretty much hard carry every game and sometimes I'm doing more damage than the rest of the team combined, just to recieve another loss. now i remember why i quit this game before"

1886,"game has potential but at its current stage i dont think its really worth it
ill explain it to you in a simple way
lets say you are in a 5v5
seems fair right? not that much difference in the tank tiers
but you are dealing with teammates who dont have a clue on how to work together
each run off in a different direction without any plan
you are the only guy who tries to play tactically while your teammates are rich kids who bought top tier tanks and dont know how to aim 

but hey
if you had a full team of friends with you
then it would probably be fun

"
1887,"fun

1888,"Very nice tank game, a good variety of tanks/playstyle you can choose from. Lots of unique, rather fun modes too (on cycle). Just sometimes there are a few broken tanks which ruins the day. However, in general, it feels like a pretty enjoyable game (lots of grinding tho)! Keep up with the good work!
(Also PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make it less p2w...)"
1889,this game is absolutly amazing
1890,"Great game, I cant stop playing it ^^"
1891,"i wasted like 3k hours on this game and a lot of money, i wont play it again but when i did i had a pretty good time. 6/10"
1892,"Good time passing game. Aside from the P2W part, I wish they didn't time-box the battle-pass since it feels like another job to have to come back every day to make sure you get x amount of points if you are planning on completing 100%. Resulting in no incentive to keep playing once you have gotten you max points for a given day."
1893,nice game
1894,I enjoy this game it's very playable

1918,"first rule: never rush when heavy tanks and tank destroyers are not in a ready-to-fire position
the second rule: play with your friends because you can directly talk to them when the match is running and set a strategy or tell some information
third rule: use a tank that you understand and you are already very good at using that tank
the fourth rule: don't be alone on the battlefield because the enemy can finish you off easily
fifth rule: play happily without burden or anger so that your performance and mentality don't drop and fall

1929,Yo nice one but many bugs
1930,Some balance changes to be made. Overall a very fun game with many vehicles too chose from. From playing this game for 7 years and 400 hours i can confidently say that World Of Tanks Blitz has plenty to offer
1931,its good
1932,I have played this game for many years and still continue to play even with very op tanks because the game is still fun.
1933,really good game
1934,Merry Koreastmas on 12.25
1935,good game... yeah thats all
1936,"Very fun game to play for temporary breaks. I have been playing on Russian server since I know Russian. Also there are a lot of players and it is competitive. I have spent more than $100 in this game and bought some in game tanks even though it is free pack because I rather to buy good tanks in-game tier 8 that give good credit farming and make me to develop my tree branch to tier X easier.  

Some battles are having bots involved due to lack of players, but I do not notice them often when I am playing because most of times I win and players talk to me through commands. It really depends on the team.

The game has a lot of extra game modes, my favorite ones are gravity and big boss modes. More are to try out with...!

Rating mode is also involved in this game where you can try all-in and challenge against your own skills playing very skilled players. The ranked battles allows you to earn winning points and credits even tough you lost and are 1st on damage table list i.e. highest performed on the allied team. 

I only complain about high pings that I have when playing at Russia from US West, it makes me to have 180 ms ping constantly which I have to deal with a small delay. I wish the servers were united and allowed to reduce the ping to lowest possible. 

I seek forward to more improvements, but overall the game is fun to play and recommended!

There are video's and photos I have made in-game enjoy:

1937,As my 2 colleague mentioned above in a serious analysis that requires months of research and study. bad game i go to bed
1938,plays on my shit laptop which im thankful about. Good strategic shooter. If your a gamer and like shooters and don't like this I feel bad for you.
1939,"This can be a fun leisure activity,
especially when I approach play with my own intention and feel free to leave before stress creeps in."
1940,abit pay to win but if you can get around that its a good game
1941,"okay, heres the deal, the game is a Great Tank Game. - If you a money spender like i am, then stay away from the tanks until you know what youre doing / know what your shooting at on the tanks, (its different for each tank) if you buy a t8 tank you will be playing against t8 tanks, and they know what they are doing lol... - the best thing to do... is play the game as intended, if you dont wanna grind for the upgrades for each tank. buy that shit lol. its what i did. - but over all the game is pretty awesome. my favorite match ups is the t5-t6 area, its more my level of game play and im not being taken out the second i expose my tank to the enemy. (the higher level players, Are really good.)"
1942,I really like this game in comparison to the World of Tanks Console/PC for its simplicity as well as the least amount of stress in 15 v 15 maps. The multiplayer has less people in each round making your actions or mistakes more impactful to the game all the while having a strong award system for progression that feels faster than the traditional World of Tanks.
1943,becuase it good
1944,gud
1945,Easy to use.  Good action.  For all ages.  My grandson and I play a lot.  He may not read and write very well but he can do some damage and take out tanks.  Especially in Levels 1 through 3.
1946,its good
1947,"awesome play it for sure
"
1948,pew pew
1949,"good game, lots of content , after tier 6 it becomes obvious that it is pay to win, tier 8 made me  realize that it is no better than its bigger brother WOT. 

waste of time and energy, that or big waste of money."
1950,War Thunder is also free to play. Just to let you know.
1951,"I've played other WOT games and think this version is the best by far. I like the different battle modes available, like rated and big boss, instead of just regular gameplay. I've also played this version both on my phone and on my laptop. There are pros and cons to both. My phone offers more perks, like watching ads for free stuff. However, my laptop has a much bigger screen and is more user friendly when it comes to steering and driving the tanks. I also like that this game is available on so many different platforms. Which device and platform do you like to use?"
1952,wanna have a happy life? wanna stay rich? skip right past this game!! cuz once ur into this.... There. Is. No. Getting. Out.
1953,"Run away, fools!1!"
1954,its fun easy grinding game
1955,to many cheater
1956,frumos
1957,"Good Game I guess, A bit pay to win in my opinion but there are good tanks that are available to F2P"
1958,"This game is a test of your patience (your armor) against annoyance,stress ...

1. People join but do not move from starting point
2. People get in position but do not move no matter (even there is no way to shoot) 
3. People hide and do not move even when enemy near them and easy to shoot
4. People rush to their deaths from the beginning
5. Hard to make come back with each lost tank when you think suicide drivers
6. If your team lose their higher ranked heavy tank, it become way worse
7. Some players so lost themselves to shooting (snipe), they do not see the tank that shoots them with one shot life and kills them
8. Matches between same level tanks so there is no player level to make matches to be proper, you may crash the enemy (7-0) or may get crashed easily (I took 6 tanks but we still lost because you start with less people), and balanced matches is rare (I get that matches supposed to be fast pace but this is not that)
9. Sometimes, some players feel like 3 year old kids whose parents left them to play so they can have a relaxed time o.O (They drive around)
10. If you win by capturing the base and not shooting, you get nothing, no exp no money and you may lose money. The win you get stays as letters because it won't count as win for the missions or special things etc.

I do not care positives because even winning do not make you felt it.
You may find positives which you may enjoy if you play the game.
There are also interesting balance issues between tanks o.O

Have a nice day"

1967,"Garbage game with very sick matching making system. Some day you always win no matter what you do, someday you always loose not matter what you do. The trend is so obvious and can not be explained by statistics.  The only explanation is WG play nasty tricks on game matching to make players win or loose in a roll to stimulate emotion , so players can addict to this boring game."
1968,"Pay to win at it's finest.

Don't bother playing this game unless you want to waste real money on a substandard game.

the types of tanks don't even seem to matter it's like a bad phone game, where you put round after round into an enemy tank but instead of actual hit locations, it's a simple game of attrition."

1975,Started playn WoT 3 days ago then I find WoTB love both of them but Blitz is faster paced and in your face action. Big boss is super amazing...maybe I'm just sayn that since it's my first event....ohhh the giggles!!!!

1994,"This is ironically the only good tank game on PC (imo) since:
-War Thunder is painful with frustrating gameplay and sluggish grind for lineups and modifications
-World of Tanks PC is painful with crew system grind for lightbulb and crew management (i haven't payed WoT PC that much so idk what else)

At least in WoTB:
-you don't have to grind crew for lightbulb; its unlocked by default and crew system is more streamlined, only having crew training percentage per individual tank and a singular skill tree that applies to ALL tanks
-modification grind is less painful thanks to Free XP so you can play whatever tank you want and still be able to upgrade, unlike War Thunder
-you literally can't bleed credits unless you play like ass or use a ton of consumables in one match/equip too much items
-there's no crew lock that stops you from playing the game if you exit early or die from lack of spawn points early
-repair costs? what the hell is that? (at least in low tiers, and even in higher tiers its not bad)
-events are actually fun when they add quirky gamemodes, unlike in war thunder where its just more grind
-battle pass progression is relatively smooth, compared to war thunder where you'll gain like what... 1 level per 2 weeks if you play casually? the rewards aren't even that good and there's 100 levels there
-the grind is lessened thanks to the free XP boosters given in daily/weekly boxes
-Arty doesn't exist
(most ot the points raised are against War Thunder since I've played that more than WoT PC since i'm new to it)

In summary: Good mobile game with less grind than the two mentioned above, somehow."
1995,"I downloaded this because I was on a long car-trip and wanted to satiate myself with some tank game play. 

That's not the case for probably 99% of people, so honestly, I'm not entirely sure why someone would choose to play this over the well polished and much better developed (in every single way) WoT game. 

I guess you can progress on your phone, and play cross play, but even then, just download the normal game dude lol."
1996,works now but why does the gun bug sometimes
1997,Eat. Sleep. Tank
1998,"i like it more than regular WoT for the +1-1 matchmaking and the lack of arty. theres some ridiculous tanks like the annihilator and the smasher, but overall its a lot of fun. just don't take it seriously and expect crap teammates. with the addition of boosters it makes it faster and easier to grind tanks as well"
1999,trash
2000,"Conclusion of my novel:

The devs broke the game.


WOT Blitz review, the Novel:
(I could write 2x as much, but stopped)
(spot system, bad balance in the tech tree, battle pass, broken events, removed free tanks that got added back as paid tanks, maps are not getting updates, some tanks/entire lines are useless etc.)

The game is very simple, anyone can get good at it.
It runs on anything, for real. Natural potatoes included.
It's fun, the games are short.
It's not P2W, but premium tanks provide an easy way into high tiers, with slightly better stats then free ones.

Low tiers (1-4) are introductary tiers, you can get passed them in a couple battles, these are pointless tiers, almost all tanks are the same, there's no challange.

Tiers 5-7 are the tiers where you are meant to learn how to play the game.
These are the tiers where all kinds of tanks are introduced.

Tiers 8-10 are the tiers that give some challange.

So the game gives you an idea on how to progress, and git gud.

Now for the bad part.

WG has no idea about balancing.
They literally kill certain tanks.
And buff others to the point where you see min 2 of them in each battle, cause they're op.

You can buy into high tiers buy paying like 10$ for tier 8.
And you can rush high tiers, it doesn't take more than 1k matches to reach a Tier 10 if you grind for it.
(1k matches isn't that much, ~50 hours for the highest tier)

Most players have less IQ than roblox players.
The community is somewhat toxic.

War Gaming has messed up multiple times recently.

The 2 big ones:

They added tanks with missiles. They are broken, cause you can shoot without exposing yourself. Instead of changing how they work, they destroyed the stats of the missiles to the point where they're useless.

The most OP tank in the game is the Smasher. It used to be very very rare.
But now they gave it away for FREE.
(okay, it was an event where you had to play ~3 hours in 2 weeks to have a 4% chance of getting it)
But technically it means that ~4% of players have it now.
So about in 40% of the matches you have atleast 1 in the server now.

So basicly we have a situation, where tier 6-7 are unplayable due to the amount of smashers and the over buffed tier 7 heavies.
Tier 8 is full of premiums, which can ruin the gameplay for free tanks, unless you're good.
Tier 9-10 is meh, it used to be the same as lower tiers, but matches are much longer.

Match making:
There are 2 kinds of mm:
Casual:
Teams are basicly random. The reason being is that WG doesn't want to ruin the WR of better players by having a balanced casual mm. That's totally reasonable imo.

Rated:
It's meant to be balanced. But from my experience it's the same ♥♥♥♥ as casual, but more toxic and you can't play in platoon.

There are special game modes, the devs put them in regularily, these are very fun and If, even if I quit the game, I would come back for a few matches in them."

If you are confident you can carry your team single handedly or dont mind loosing due to bad match making then go ahead. your team are morons. you cant trust them to help you out and they most likely will hinder you if it boosts their damage, its just what the wotb player base is like these days. The devs on the other hand arnt helping hte game either, its a cash grab. they release stupidly broken tanks which is only  available for real life currency."

2030,"after playing this game for 6 years on my phone, taking a break and come back. I feel like this game is really sucks. Premium tanks are OP, and they've never got nerf, makes tech tree tanks suck ass to play, Stupid  obj252U is still so op that you have to use gold rounds to kill in an is3.

2041,"It's a fun lite version of World of Tanks. The main game doesn't run on macOS so this is what I play.
Aside from the pay to win aspect (premium ammo is significantly better than standard). It is entirely possible to play and have fun for free or very little money which is always good in my book. Even without paying anything a good player can still run about a 60% win ratio which is satisfying enough."
2042,Nice game if you're playing casually
2043,piece of shi`t
2044,bruh
2045,"The game is made for bad players, you're not allowed to try to do anything outside of the same exact thing that every other person does every game unless you want to get fucking kicked in the dick and told ""conform you fucking retard"". Most of your ""high skill"" games is from coming across a painfully stupid team, while also having a team just as stupid, allowing you to farm damage as half of your team is still trying to figure out that staring at the sun is harmful for your eyes. 
This game literally can never be good simply due to the fact that ranked is not a constant 24/7 game mode that you can play for a proper gameplay experience without having a team mate that could not kill something that was 2ft in front of them because they decided to aim at the thickest part of a tanks armor and then proceeds to die because their IQ is that of a fucking pecan. 

If you're a god damn idiot, this game is great for you, if you have any sort of thought process beyond mouth breathing, this game will never be for you."

2056,"I think the game is well balanced and it's fun to play, even when you are first starting out. It's very user friendly & if not careful one could find themselves  hooked in no time. There is also a lot of video's and content creators so if you ever want to find some pointers on certain tanks or the game in general there is no shortage of it out there. I give it a solid 8 out of 10..."

2096,"The game is good! I liked it, but when two men with big trunks approached me from behind, I was a little scared. I saw two young men running with a bomb and these two with guns wanted to kill them, so I decided to let them kill good people. I stabbed two men with trunks and let people with a bomb clear the hangar of debris. They thanked me and drew a picture with a heart. I was very happy, but they called me names on the radio. I still didn't understand why I was insulted (But I liked playing)"

2125,Its really fun
2126,"Awesome game for young adults. You are not locked in, and you don't have to buy anything if you are very patient.
Game heavily favours younger very competitive players with 'very fast' reactions and a 'great memory' of maps and tanks.

Be warned, Much harder to enjoy for older slower players like me (age 64) which is a shame as I would play more. Sadly WG takes No account is taken of a players poor win rate when matching up every 7 minute game/team. So unless you are a good player be prepared to loose.

2136,yeah overall it's pretty good.
2137,its great
2138,That Nostalgic feeling of Battle city and Tanks from 90's Gaming.
2139,"O original tem uma mecânica melhor,porem o Blitz é divertido,e serve para pcs mais fracos como o meu.
Achei muito bacana o jogo (as coisas tem um preço muito alto,mas não e pay2win pelo menos)."
2140,"Very fun for tank nerds. the combat is fun, and it is very satisfying to get a kill. strategies are very easy to develop. when im the last tank left in my team against a team of two or more, it is terrifying. i hardly ever
 make it out alive. but, despite that, i am always sat on the edge of my seat, just in case something cool happens (cool things happen very common)."
2141,"I have played this game on and off for 4 years, although not much on steam, this game is still fun. It can also run on my s**ty laptop! Theres some... unbalance... with microtransactions but overall blaming my teammates seems to make me feel a little better. 

7/10 would recomend"

Edit 2022: Its pretty grindy but i love it!"
2156,EZZZZ ASW
2157,One Word... PERFECT
2158,prety good as long as u have good tanks lol
2159,"I've been playing WoT Blitz for over 5 years as of this writing, and only recently got it on Steam instead of via MS Store. I have a love/hate relationship with the game, and yet despite any frustrations I might feel with the game or some of its less mature players, I still highly recommend it.

The gameplay is easy to learn and hard to master. Some people get good right away, others take some time, and still others just never really will. If you don't take the game too seriously, none of that matters. There is plenty of fun to be had here.

Is it ""Pay-to-Win"" like some people have said? No. While I don't have a screenshot showing my stats, I play my best games in 100% free, tech tree tanks. That's just a fact. While there are some premium vehicles that are overpowered, for the majority of them, the real draw is their increased credit earning. That's it, and you absolutely do NOT have to buy them to do well.

Speaking of the premium tanks, throughout the year WarGaming gives us ways to get some of them for free. PLUS, at the time of this writing, you can earn free gold daily via the mobile version of the game. Save it up for the Xmas auction and you could be walking away with something wonderful, all without paying a dime.

In fact, I encourage people to NOT spend any money on the game. Once you do, you may find (as I have) that it's a bit of a slippery slope. If you're a collector like I am, you could easily spend hundreds or more on this game, and I can guarantee that you won't play a majority of those tanks very often (some of the most collectible ones are actually kind of crap). I will, however, repeat myself: you DO NOT have to spend any money on this game.

If you want me to give the game a numerical rating, I'd say 8/10, and that's in large part due to some of the more toxic members of the community. I just shut off chat in battles (for both teams) and don't accept messages from anyone outside of my clan or friends list. Problem (mostly) solved. The only other issue I really come across is the aptly named ""ghost shot"" which seemingly just disappears and hits nothing, but those are rare and only seem to happen to me in tight situations (that last bit was meant as humor - those just happen to be the only times I care).

I recommend giving the game a shot, at least. I and many others love it, and you might, too. Plus...it IS free. Download it and join the party."
2160,Its a great game lots of fun if you're into tanks.
2161,"On a scale of 1-10, it is a 7.8 out of 10. I would give this game an 8.5 out of 10 if you could team up with more than 1 other person in a platoon."
2162,pay2play but fun to play anyway
2163,Easy to play and makes fun
2164,It's so good that i had to sell my kidney for a tier 10 premium.
2165,Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you.
2166,"you can shoot children 10/10
"
2167,some players hp dont go down.
2168,"in my time playing this game i have encountered a sacred creature named AVVOCATO, it was a hallowing experience, as he rendered every single second of my time spent with him into a unending nightmare, if you enconter such a creature please use the ingame reporting feature to send him to the great creators."
2169,"Much, much better than Warthunder"
2170,its a fon gay balls i am not gay help meeeeee i want to lick balls and puss y
2171,its okay i guess...
2172,"Very good, they had lots of work with this game, play it!/ Nagyon jó, sok munkájuk volt ezzel a játékkal, ne félj tőle, játsz!"
2173,"Never lose, but good game for my spec PC Potato"
2174,"Game is nice and fast to play few quick battles. However, the community is toxic and mostly raging children."
2175,need more balance
2176,"Matchmaking is completely broken, no matter what some ""Dev"" from the game tells you. team play is virtually non-existent the higher up in tiers you go thanks to children buying high tier premiums and not knowing how to even drive their tank forward. would not recommend at its current state."
2177,fast paced fun..
2178,"Shhhhhhhhhhhh
"
2179,great grind very rewarding pay to win does exist although the free to play tanks are in the meta more than the premiums top teir
2180,"really good game great graphics, so much fun. would be better if you could have more in a platoon like 3 instead of 2."
2181,One of the best free to play game right now 5gb for a great game for me it's a deal

2193,pro tank game if u like this dont get wot
2194,"awesome game love it 
"
2195,for levels
2196,"I would say that first several hours in this game are quite funny, though as with most of those F2P, Pay2Win games it is useless to spend on it neither too much money (if at all) nor too much time, it is best to treat it as a funny way to pass some time ... with moderation :D"
2197,Good
2198,I'm fell good
2199,Very short que times. not pay to win. very fun game overall.
2200, i cant stop playing........ despite how much i hate the game

2203,Not played this for ages and its vastly improved.  Love it.

2213,this game is good
2214,"World of Tanks Blitz is originally a ""mobile"" offshoot of the tank simulator for iOS and Android, with 7v7 battles and a huge fleet of over 370 tanks. Most of the mechanics in the game are similar to the ""older"" version of the game - to win, you need to destroy the enemy team in seven minutes or win on points, capturing the bases. Blitz has tank damage physics, as well as interaction with the terrain - for example, you can drift on a fast tank."
2215,"well after a couple hours of play this game, it's a fun games (some match) but if you find it stressful grinding and terrible matchmaking, just don't take it personally and just relax take a break do something else (for me if I lose 5 match from 5 battle, I exit the game and doing other things). Just remember that this game is Blitz version so the grinding is way more easy than the non Blitz version. 
Pay to Win ? maybe, Wargaming doesn't want to nerf OP premium tank? yes, What to do if you find a match like unbalance team or unbalance tank composition? just do your part and if it lose, just move on to the next battle. So just take your time, play with friend as a platoon or clan mate and enjoy the game like you enjoy your favorite tank on the game."
2216,"very nice game
"
2217,"this game is good, apik nemen wes, rugi lek gk main."
2218,Much better then Wot on pc...even tho this is also on pc so you can piss on mobile playes. But it's much better trust me
2219,totally crap forces you to load steam which makes the game unplayably slow
2220,Good game with great mechanics. Can be a steep learning curve.
2221,"childhood,"
2222,"The match making is very balanced and totally 100% not paytowin, also WHY THE FUCK WOULD A TANK DISAPEAR AND WHEN I SHOOT A PLACE IT CLEARLY WAS ONE MILI FUCKING SECONDS AGO NOT HIT BC THEY DISAPEARED WITH THEIR FANCY FUCKING CAMO I CLEARLY KNOW WHERE THEY ARE WHY MAKE THEM DISAPEAR"
2223,S M A S H
2224,just play war thunder. this game so p2w
2225,"If you like History, Cars, Tanks, and a mix of Realism and Fantasy then this is your go to game

This game features a Wide Variety of tanks, all of which provides different playstyles
A few have special consumables and provisions, some are over powered and a vast majority is for you to train and get better
Game modes which is unheard of for a Tank Game

Oh, not to mention its support for crossplay to Nintendo Switch, IOS, Android, Linus, Windows, Just about every platform there is

However Free to play games always have a flaw. A few of which are

- Pay to Win Vehicles only obtainable from real money purchases with sometimes Overpowered characteristics
- A bit of an Unbalanced match making on Random Battles (but it makes sense because its Random)
- 75% players Just Play, they don't know key mechanics, vehicle playstyle and even what to do with each type of tank there is offered
- Cosmetics, Premium account Time and Premium Tanks are purchased using gold which require real money
- Premium Battle Pass which require real money
- Gambling is a thing in this game with the existence of containers with very low drop rates

But not all hope is lost because

- Wargaming hosts events where you can receive free premium tanks (balanced ones) to help with your grind
- Separate game modes which are usually fun and doesn't effect statistics
- You can obtain gold for being active in clan missions, in game events
- Standard Battle Pass, Mission Containers and Free Daily/Weekly Containers can also help you on your grind as they do give out Boosters, Credits, Camouflages, Premium account time, A bit of Gold, Free xp and sometimes a Premium Tank (if you're lucky atleast)

There are also Guide Videos from Wargaming Themselves explaining about game mechanics
Trust me once you know how the game mechanic works, Gameplay gets so much better 

That is all about this game from 5 years playing experience
I hope my review is helpful"
2226,epic
2227,"super gud would reccomend 
DONT USE THE ANTI TANK GUNS"
2228,It is a balanced game.
2229,this game was so bad broke people dont come at me
2230,"Developers do not care about player feedback, blame you for their server problems, consistent imbalance of tanks. They do all the wrongs things just to make a quick buck."

2245,pay to win sračka
2246,the game is amazing
2247,good
2248,I prefer WoT blitz over regular WoT. It is more fast-paced and there is no random element in the form of artillery.
2249,Very Nice and easy to learn game. And if u like WW2 history this is for you !
2250,S'ight. good practice lol
2251,gg
2252,"In two words: great game. You'll have to learn how to control the tank well, what tank suits your style of playing and how to be successful in a team. If you're looking for a solo rampage kind of game, you better look the other way. This game is all about teamwork and, at times, individual brilliance. From getting to know maps and best strategic spots for a win to simple quick thinking and hiding behind a dead tank, you'll get to experience it all. Just when you think everything is lost, one individual will simply fight against all odds and take a win for the whole team.
Now for the good/bad points. Game interface is very intuitive and user friendly. Menus as well. However, researching tanks can sometimes be a bit tedious and long. It can take long time to earn enough money to buy new tanks and upgrade each tank. It's easy to get frustrated in the meantime 'cos tanks are quite disadvantaged while stock and defeats will follow. Luckily, there are boosters to get you there quicker. Premium tanks can be bought for money or gold coins that will require watching ads and completing clan missions. With patience, collecting gold is achievable. Premium tanks bring more money per match so it's definitely worth collecting gold to buy one. All in all, game teaches you patience and tact. Definitely give it a go."
2253,its fun
2254,"For a game that revolves around teamplaying, there is little to no team anything. Janky hitboxes, ghost shells, bullshit ricochets, the whole bunch. Was funny but god awful to play! Also severe pocket sniffing. Close your wallet mates!!!"
2255,Biggest waste of time. Both a good and a bad thing.

Have to alt-f4 to escape."
2263,I like it but do not recommend anyone play it. Grind is insane and pay2win.
2264,"levels controlled by skill level and selection of multiple tanks to own is very nice. My garage has level 4 to 8 tanks. When I'm gone far awhile, and start back up as a level 4. Then when I'm comfortable I can move up. Nice"
2265,"It is literally repetitive and pay to win, so unless I get everything without paying money and not using luck to get gord tanks it still dogwater"

2279,Good game but sometimes really annoying
2280,you buy a tank and they change its characteristics. i think is bad form to make you buy something then they weaken it so its not what you bought.  otherwise a great game.

Need some more tanks"
2289,"Long time player, dedicated team, lots of updates. Loyal fanbase and players and just great overall for a small version of WoT!"
2290,An utter waste when Admin makes matches so lopsided by stacking teams with better tanks & cheat codes. Disgusting when playing at a particular level (say 6) and Admin tosses a buttload of 7's in making matches worthless.

2307,"Game is fun, many tanks. The tecnology tree has been made so good."

2315,"Very good and fun game, although if you are going to play a lot and are not wanting to spend a little bit of money on a premium tank to grind credits with you probably aren't going to have a very fun time because of how long it will take to grind lines. you can think of it as like a $10 dollar game instead of a free one because to get the full experience your going to need a way of grinding credits. the game mechanics are cool and its a pretty well balanced game (except for VII tanks). i would recommend this game to anyone :). the company that runs this game tho, kinda scummy :L."
2316,"Really good game, especially if you like the desktop version.  No arty, and not quite as sophisticated, but still fun."
2317,Yes
2318,cool
2319,.
2320,"Great game. Plenty of tanks to choose from, from different nations. Of course there is the options of buying premium tanks. But I use the steam gift cards if I see something I want. I like watching the tournaments, great to see the experts going at it. Hope you enjoy the game too."
2321,"This game is awesome lagging all the time, garbage!"
2322,"

The constant ads to buy the battlepass and purchase in game credits is super annoying, Otherwise okayish game"
2323,I always grind for days to only get the same item I already have
2324,world of tanks > war thunder
2325,don't play if you don't want to contract cancer due to noob light tanks camping at the back
2326,We’ve been trying to reach you about your car’s extended warranty
2327,"this game needs more fun maps, and caves to hide tanks in, getting boring same stuff all the time,"
2328,I prefer war thunder but this game is a cross platform soo its alright
2329,you have to know you tank and hope rng is in your favor. Beside that it's pretty fun when you win in a 1v3 in a t-34
2330,"matchmaking gajelas, isinya player 15K battle tapi mainnya kek org tolol"
2331,"THESE PEOPLE HAVE NO CHANCE CAW CAW, BECAUSE CROW HAS PLAYED VALKYRIA CHRONICLES CAW CAW. YOU SHOOT THE TANK IN THE BACK AND DO A CRIT HIT CAW CAW

THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT THIS GAME DOES NOT HAVE BIG BREASTED SNIPER LADY WITH FOX EARS CAW CAW"
2332,Balance? Nooo it's not about this game.
2333,"If you have a gambling prone personality, don't get this game. If you have an easily persuaded pay-to-win mentality, don't get this game. If you are easily parted from your hard earned money, don't get this game. If you have a ragey gaming personality, DO NOT get this game. If you have an addictive personality, ESPECIALLY do not get this game. If you value your money, mental health, time and hell, the purity of your soul, DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!! 

25 percent RNG differential on most RNG-determined things like shot dispersion or damage roll will ensure controller or keyboard breaking moments that ""just should NOT have happened!"" 

I would say pay to win is a real thing, although it seems even in premium tanks with premium account and premium ammunition you can still easily get a 25 defeat streak if you try. 

I have wasted so much time, money, and energy on this sodding sorry excuse of a gaming company that given one of those hypothetical time-travel, red pill/blue pill, what would you fix type questions, one of my answers would be making SURE I tell myself to NEVER TOUCH  a game made by these greedy parasites of game developer."
2334,"Great game in general and really good graphics but the only thing is when I tried to update my account EVERY password i put in was ""TOO WEAK"", so for that 4/5 stars."
2335,Great game been playing it for plenty of years.
2336,"supa fun
"
2337,"Nice game, just don't over played, if you started to get negative emotion my suggestions is to take a break. It's a game to have fun after all. Have a good time mates, Cheers"
2338,Nice
2339,It's a fun and fast paced game.
2340,a good tank game for potato computer not to lagy but there its to much bot and sometime lag spike even tho o great internet
2341,everything is sooo fun!!!
2342,This game is very fun but the DLC's are very expensive
2343,"The game is pretty much a fun experience, i'd rather prefer World Of Tanks than World Of Tanks Blitz but this is just more fun, alot more content and tanks, events, and potato pc friendly!"
2344,.
2345,It is accurate and fun
2346,"Click., Nice!"
2347,intersting :>
2348,"An easy game for a quick break. If you're looking for something of this type, but much more serious, I would rather recommend tankionline.com."
2349,"very good but when i saw the prices of gold, i cry"
2350,This game still sucks ass
2351,"dont expect a the greatest competitive play here, unless on higher tiers

make your tank go brrrr and be casual about it and you will have a good time"
2352,Easy to play….
2353,mostly pay to win
2354,I get destroyed cuz I am newbie :(
2355,"YES VERY GOOD
"
2356,pogga
2357,"strategic, has levels and dont need to think about the world"
2358,it is a fun game I enjoy it. best experience if played on PC in my opinion
2359,"great game, teams are very interesting and if you have too much money why not spend it here."
2360,this game is pretty nice
2361,"A very nice simplified version of the original World of Tanks - basically faster to get amongst it - more emphasis on action and much cleaner Ui throughout. Battles are more brawl-like and light hearted.

Some Issues: Some elements in the garage/home menus are very much mobile phone game style, so purchase advertisements are gonna be an integral part of the experience. Bit of a buzzkill but it can be gotten used too, sort of. It's been fun for about 7 hours so far"
2362,Sve najbolje
2363,Great online game.
2364,"i guess i would recommend,  played this alot not on this steam account for around 1000 hours, games OK but very pay to win lots of gambling like crates and shit. I would get it but no buy crates and other gambling items"
2365,"good
"
2366,This game will never leave you sad.

2369,great game
2370,"Avoid all games from the Wargaming group.  This is pure pay to win.  The developers seem to have no ethics in this regard.  As this game dies, and it is dying (with few US players still playing), they are doing all they can to grab cash by selling better and better tanks to offer a competitive advantage.  Your free tanks will be terrible and you will have a horrible experience playing.   To make matters worse the game is full of salty trolls.  That's understandable because the lopsided games are hard to bear.   Avoid, avoid, avoid."
2371,"If you want to feel like God Almighty slaying noobz, this game is where it's at.

Every game you will be on top as long as you have an inkling of skill."
2372,"""Free"" to play....lol. Sure it is and it's fun at first. By Tier 7, after you've spent $$$ trying to get ahead, you'll realize you've been duped and you'll never get ahead, you'll only keep spending more to keep the game play fun. The plus is the game play is quick, sound effects are cool, maps are pretty good. What they do is place you in teams where you'll be facing off against some tanks a level higher than you. This makes you think that if you can just get that tank, you'll have better success, but you'll never stop chasing it. You'll get to the point where you've built yourself a pretty good tank, but the system places you into teams where of the 7 tanks, only one other tank will be your level. You'll be outclassed every time and when you die quickly, they penalize you by taking your hard earned (and sometimes purchased) credits. No thanks. I've had enough of that BS. Deleting this game."
2373,"Ridiculous, just so damn ridiculous. The game in it self would be good. But the match making messes the good experience up. There are way too many bots in the game. Not only that, but the game purposively makes you lose. Doesn't matter how good you are, you're going to lose, if the game wants you to lose. And it has been like this since almost the beginning. To actually be able not to get into negative credits is to be a P2W (Pay-to-Win). Or, you can take your free time and waste it on this game, trying to get the the tanks you want. Without a premium account, It's nearly impossible to get enough resources. I just find this so dumb. Do NOT download this game and go play the original game instead. This is game is just a pile of crap"
2374,"Literally a waste of fu*king time, it used to be a fun game because its fast paced and can be played with friends , getting ridiculous damage in a single shot with high explosive is fun to joke around with your friends but now you just get a game that claims it is family friendly. Censoring everything from words that just is there to express slight anger or to be slightly sarcastic like damn and crap then the developers just slap you with a gambling ticket you can buy crates of 3% drop chance and market it to kids, NOT A PROBLEM. How is words like damn and crap not ok and gambling ok? Furthermore, just join the game for 2 rounds and you feel like ragequitting, teams are bloody unbalanced with some games scoring complete wipeouts 0-7 and 2-7 and the developers just stand around saying that there is not a problem with the matchmaking. Then you got the hellhole which is tier 7 with tanks like the Smasher that can completely ruin a person's day with a single shot and the developers just decided to nerf the KV 2 which is the exact same tank but a tier lower and not retardly overpowered like the Smasher. Best part? People can literally pay money and get their way to tier 10 without having to grind at all. The whole reason is to let people grind while learning how to play the game so that when they get to tier 10 they will actually know how to play, with money it just renders the entire process useless. If you think that was already a bunch of crap, wait until you hear about toxic teams tere are some teams that will yell racial slurs at you and then you can report the players but the chances of it working is nearly 0 I have played for this amount of time and I only have gotten 4 times where reports have succeeded without me having to go to the website to do it myself. Overall if the developers don't want to listen to their playerbase, this game is not worth playing until they do."

4) as new player u try to progress but being in a team that dont know the back end of a taNK TO THE FRONT.( weere u see u turn your back on tank firing at u 1v1 its pathetic. 5) good matches are 1 or 2 survive the fights, not 7/0 wins every match. im thinking of deleting the game and spend my money on better things."

2395,"One of the most Pay To Win games on Steam, more than the PC World of tanks. Don't play this game thinking you will get anywhere without spending real money, lots of it and frequently as the most OP premiums keep getting replaced by new OP premiums and they never get nerfed due to the company policy so to remain viable or to have the best odds of winning you'll have to buy a premium every 5-6 months let's say. The only tanks worthwhile are the premium ones, tech tree tanks are there just as a fodder to help find opponents for the premium VIPs.

If you don't mind spending money to gain advantages over your opponents, then you will probably not be disappointed and you will dominate despite not being always more skilled just as in any pay-to-win game.

Here you have my mobile account info just to prove I know what I'm talking about:
https://www.blitzstars.com/player/eu/Snaps_CZ
Here you have evidence that the game is pay-to-win. I know many die-hard fans of this game will keep saying the game is not pay-to-win, but the data speaks for itself: (look up tier 7-8 and see the highest Winrate tanks)
https://www.blitzstars.com/toptanks"
2396,"World of Tanks Blitz is a game where something is going on all the time. The game has its pros and cons. The biggest problem is that players are complaining that there are bots in the battles that not only spoil the gameplay but also spoil the percentage of battles won. Wuerk (win percentage) so that we can be noticed by amazing clans who can play in international tournaments and gain fame on a large scale. Despite the fact that it has flaws and minor shortcomings, the game also has a huge list of advantages, incl. there are season passes every month where you can get different rewards and there is always a new tank to get, there are clan missions every day so there are also rewards, tournaments, events, game modes. The game receives updates on an ongoing basis, fixes bugs and improves graphics, mechanics and gameplay. I really recommend you to play this amazing game because it will be fun, it will keep you hooked for hours, but it's worth equipping yourself with nerves of steel :)"

2409,"The 'lite' version of World of Tanks, battles are faster, maps smaller, and teams smaller. Quick battles, pretty fun most of the time, variety of tanks and battles to choose from. If you want more complex tactics strategies and graphical details go to the larger game, for quick rush-to-kill matches Blitz is entertaining."
2410,Never gets boring
2411,"I'd say I recommend this game because it does give you something to do. Yes, there might be toxic players regardless of which servers you play on - but then again the grindy state is what matters, gives you something to do. As a player who has played this game for about 5-6 years (just starting to get back to it on a new account) I enjoy grinding and I'm sure most people love to grind, not only that - you have fun. Overtime the game will get easier because the more you play, the higher the progress. So yes I recommend this game, absolutely. :)"

2453,"Hi! I've read a lot of different reviews for this game and I will try and write a review that will look at the game from all aspects. Some of the reviews are not telling enough to other people but I will try not to do that. 

Not looking at my Steam Playtime (I've played on my iPad and the app from Microsoft Store), I've played this game for over 5 years (I registered in 2016) and, personally, I still love this game. A quick description for all of those people who spend 30 seconds reading those, this game is a mobile version with quick battles for the original World Of Tanks. I can say, it kind of acts like a sub-game. 

Let us now dive into the game itself then! 


1. Enjoying and Staying in the Game. A lot of people say that they've played this game for a long time, and this is quite common. The game can take you in and challenge you with different tasks and tanks to unlock. This includes different weekly tasks and daily tasks to keep you up and playing. The game isn't really as addicting as some of the games you can find on the internet, but it isn't boring either! The players will move through the journey of unlocking all the different tanks in the game. It will really take a long time, but it will be fun for most players for sure!

2. Historical Mentions. A lot of different tanks in the game were taken from WW2 and WW1. I would also like to mention that the tanks in the game have a lot of detail in them. The developers have also recently announced that they are going to remodel a lot of different tanks for realistic reflections and feels like in the original game, but now for mobile devices!). I would also like to say that some tanks were created by Wargaming themselves. Those are either remade tanks from real-life or fictional tanks either taken from literature, movies or created by the developers. They are still good though!

3. Realism and Mechanics. The game, just as the original WoT does an amazing job at that, even if it is creating a fantastic 
lobby with atmospheres for different celebrations and events - to even adding easter eggs on most of the maps in the game for players to explore. The in-game mechanics have different details as well. Those might include: different armour, types of ammo, ammunition, upgrades, tank parts, the crew, fire, battle rack explosions and many-many more! WarGaming also makes sure that the game stays fun for all the players, every month has a unique Battle Pass (Usually with 80 different levels!) with lots of rewards. The game also has different modes like: Gravity Force and Uprising that a lot of players really enjoy as they have many astonishing modifications that players might have never expected. 

I would really like to mention that even if you feel that you are confused and you wouldn't like to play the game because you are new and confused, don't worry, you will pick it up at the speed of light! 

The game also has many communication systems, like global chats to complete in-game tasks, search for a platoon (Play with friends or other players) and clans. Clans have different rewards as well, many of which can give you in-game discounts for a lot of things!

The players have developer different tactics and other manipulations to play the game and I can say, there are many strategies to explore!


4. Money and In-Game Purchases. I will tell you, NEARLY 20% of all reviews mention the game being either Pay-To-Win or having too much unbalanced gameplay. In my opinion, the game is balanced. WarGaming made sure that even some of the rare and expensive premium tanks are kept at the same level of power with other tanks. The only point of premium tanks is faster in-game progress as they can give you twice the amount of rewards from the battles. Even though, the game might always offer you different purchases, it won't necessarily make you much more powerful than other players in battles. The game still offers a massive journey of progress through all the different tanks in the game so premium tanks will only help you move faster through it.

I've seen people say that they spent over 200-300 pounds on the game. I just wanna ask: ""Why?"". If you are saying that the game is pay-to-win just stop flipping buying things for no reason! Even spending as little as 5 pounds can get you a nice premium tank especially when WarGaming has a lot of nice offers prepared for players!



5. Overall, if you somehow read the entire review, then enjoy the happy strawberry on top of the cake :) 
It is always nice to try the game and see if you like it, but never judge a book by its cover. Spend some time playing it, reach the tanks of fifth level and see if you still like it! You can find some of the other details (just as a personal rating) from me below. Cheers, Nit.


>>> Graphics: 7/10 [Settings, Updates]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> Gameplay: 9/10 [Different modes, tanks]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> In-game purchases: 8/10 [Much faster progress, quite balanced]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> Tanks: 9/10 [Different ranges, specifications and details] (I would give a 10 for WoT)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> Compatibility: 6/10 [A bit difficult to play on mobile]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> Overall: 8/10 [A very nice game and it is definitely worth a try!]

I love this game, it is really fun with all of the different game modes that it has to offer.
It's hard, sure, but it really brings grinding to another level.
I currently have 3 tier 8's in this game and getting them was hard. I have the KV-4, the ISU-152, and the AT 15.
This game also has a lot of historical references. For example, the tanks themselves. A lot of them like the Tiger 1 for example have been in WWII and a lot of other tanks from different nations have also been used in WWII. There are also original tanks that Wargaming made themselves. For example, the Smasher. It is a tank with high penetration values and 640 average damage. This basically means that you can penetrate most enemy tanks and can leave them sorry they ever poked up on that ridge line.
At first glance this game seems like only a retard would play it, but once you start actually playing it, it's kind of addictive. Thanks for taking the time to read my review, I hope you enjoy the game if you do get it."
2467,Great game to pass the time on days where you don't know what to play.

The game is nice if you are f2p until about tier 6 when the grind really kicks in. Regardless it is a really fun game to play once you get the hang of things, 9/10 would recommend."

2508,"almost 500 hours of my life wasted.
200 euros of my hard earned money wasted.
The faith I had for the community is gone.
And all of this because of some ""very"" simple reason.
My general PoV:
The maturity this game once had is dead and now it's just a shell for kids who like to spend 300 euros per month on the premium tanks they make every once or two weeks where they are still not getting creative with the fake names.
Competitiveness left when tier 10 premium tanks were added and more and more offers appeared in the shop. Most serious people left the game as soon as they saw where it was heading but I stayed like the sucker I was 2 years ago.
The sad and cunning trap these games have is that they make you think your effort in the game counts towards something and if you stop playing you will lose it. After getting 2 tier 10 tanks and a notable amount of premium tanks I came to the realization that the grind is just endless, there is no endgame even if you complete all tech trees, because they will just keep adding more tanks to keep people in the game.
I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game about 4 times and every time I played it again was in the hope that for once I could have fun. I'm not one of those salty kids who keep blaming their own team when they die first, but the competitive matchmaker and the matchmaker overall don't care about player skill, only for the tank you have. So it's very easy to get matched with someone that has 30-40% WR only because he has a shop tank so that the teams would have a relevant amount of diversity in terms of tank types.
The ""endgame"":
The meta of this game is either a tech tree tank that takes 4 months to grind or a tier 10 premium tank that occasionally appears in the shop for about 75 euro. It's not like they sell these tanks to fulfill their upkeep costs, but it seems more like milking at this point. I've seen it in many other games and I know what it feels like. 90% of the people you will find as your teammates are toddlers and in a game that requires communication to win makes it clear you can't really depend on someone like that who will just go die only because he didn't want to do what you told him, he lacks common sense and so does the community at this point.
The youtube community:
Most YouTubers I've seen playing this are not really having fun of it, it may seem like they are having fun but what they had when they first started making videos was gone after a while and was replaced with an advertisement puppet. All this of course is nothing but my pure opinion on what this game has become.
Conclusion:
It could have been something great if we didn't stick at the mobile plan, because it's the universal truth that free mobile games want to milk your wallet in the end and that's an unhealthy practice at pc gaming. I have found a better community than this at a more fun game of which I won't mention because I'm not an advertiser. If you want a good game and community just look elsewhere, because, ""You picked the wrong house, fool!""."
2509,"this game fun but MM so broken, i don't recommend this game for someone who want play game for fun especially for free to play player. i swear high tier is full of shiiit (tier 9 and 10), p2w is issue for this game combine with MM and Good RNG enemy team will blow your in sec. enjoy this game but i hate so much."
2510,nice
2511,"Not enough players, game is kinda dead."
2512,"WOTB is fun for a few hours but you quickly hit the P2W wall and are stuck playing with the same Tier IV tank over and over to grind XP for the next level. All the while you are constantly bombarded with the typical F2P bullshit (daily quests, consumables, tons of currencies, ""offers""). The game itself is pretty stupid too. There is no reviving or subsequent rounds so why do you have to watch the rest of the match when you die?

Also, can icon interface please die now? Stop making me guess which of the 500 vague icons does what. Thanks."
2513,Sadly p2w! Not much more needs saying. l8r

2515,"This game is designed to do one thing: earn money. You can install it for free, but the in-game purchases ruin it.
Initially you move along nicely, but when you hit level 5 and 6 tanks, things start to go downhill. 
Suddenly you aren't earning money, thus can't upgrade. Even when you win a battle you still lose money.
To get past this you need a premium account (which, of course, you can buy).
In the meantime, those that did buy upgrades had a fun time popping your tank within a minutes of starting a game.
All the while you are blasted with ads to buy upgrades/premium accounts/upgrades/special ammo/whatever.
So: up to level 5 tanks its fun, thereafter it sucks."
2516,Super fun only thing is that it took me 5 years to learn how to play the game so i am glad that they updated the tutorial. Some tanks they release for £££ is a bit dodgy sometimes like the concept 1B which is too op

2573,"Not too bad, pretty decent to the Original. Pretty Realistic. Good Graphics. Very Fun."
2574,"I've played this game since roughly when it first came out. When I found out it was on steam I downloaded it there. I have found steam to be far more reliable when updating the game, unlike the windows's store. The game itself is good, requires skill but not near as much as WOT PC. Also requires some luck from match making that at least half of your teammates can play the game well. The gameplay itself is great, the devs work hard to keep out the bugs and hackers. Now my negatives... The game has definitely been pushing micro transactions a lot more. They also removed the ability to research many low tier tanks, than turned around and offered to sell them. I also wish that the panel would default to the notifications screen and not the news tab.It also has been crashing a lot more recently all in all I'd probably give it a 7.5 out of 10."

To get here and type this...My opinion and my sugestions

Why I recomend this game to others players after 144 hours and all this hell?

It's a nice game with nice cartoon graphics with a lot of well designed 3d tanks, u just have to deal with p2w, broken OP tanks and toxicity...

-
Hints to start well on the game
Look for the best line that requires less EXP since it takes a lot of time to grind if u have only 1 year or less of experience on the game...I have played world of tanks PC version for 5 years yet the diferent mechanics made me take a year to arrive to tier IX...Certain heavies, Tank destroyers and light tanks lines are extremly bad...Try to check if is worth to grind for that line of that nation, there is a lot of info on this wonderfull virtual world called Internet

-
1 year and u only made 144 hours?

Its because I have played on mobile and windows store edition...Steam seems to be better and more optimized

-
Worst thing at the game

I'm a low end computer player, so mm, p2w and all stuff isn't my problem, the problem its not being able to use 120fps (only max 60fps lock) with means some sutters and lag (also instability), unless u playing on IOS or Mac-OS (Also servers are a pain, but it's understandable since its around 4 to 5 games that WG owns and updates and there is a lot of servers and stuff for those)

-
Ever wasted money? Was worth of it?

Yes I did wasted money mostly to battlepass. If was worth? IDK, the boxes act like EA loot boxs...pure gambling system... There is OP tanks and u can reach faster to Tier X...So Idk if it was worth of around 130€ wasted since I started to play this game on Steam

I hope my info was usefull and helpfull...I wish you the best luck, happy xmas and the best life u can ever possible have...thx ;)"

The game isn't bad but it isn't good either, after a while you will get bored of it and forget about the game, it is good to waste some time."

2596,"I like gun and this game has quite big gun and gun go BOOM.
Neonic is very pleased."
2597,While the battles are much better on blitz i still would love it if they would come up with better spotting mechanics. having a 150 ton tank hidden 100 yards from you is stupid. just make maps better and let there be realistic spotting. its far far worse in the standard world of tanks as you are getting hit mostly by tanks hiding in bushes on the edge of the maps.

2606,good game lol
2607,"As a someone who has over 3k hours in War Thunder,i gotta say this game is faster in terms of unlocking vehicles. Its not as realistic as War Thunder but that isnt the point of the game anyways. If you like arcade-ish types of games but you cant run the real WoT i suggest you go for this game. Considering not everyone has amazing PC and likes these types of games,i'll give it a 10/10."
2608,"The game itself isn't bad -> It has nice E-sport potential, a lot of good vehicles and if you want to spend some money on it -> It has also a lot of nice, unique premium tanks. Last updates encourages players to play better -> you can now earn much more money with medals such as M. The game economy is pretty good, at least much more better than in „big"" World of Tanks. You can grind the trees really fast, and Battle Pass has a great value, for about €5 monthly you get a lot of nice discounts, bonuses, premium tank and even some gold.

Many people are considering the game as „pay to win"", no, it's not pay 2 win, many of premium vehicles (there are some exceptions like Obj. 252U) are worse than their standard tree equivalents. There are some really strong premium machines, but mainly (and actually always) in META there are min. 80% of standard, free, tree vehicles.

There are a lot of lot boxes which aren't really profitable, but if you just focus on playing and sometimes you want to boost yourself with some bonuses - WoT Blitz is much better game currently placed that high on the market THAN War Thunder or big WoT, because as far as you can see - almost every bigger „Tank Game"" currently is full of aggressive marketing, while in WoTB you of course can buy something, but it is not needed if you can grind vechicles MUCH, MUCH faster than in any other Tank game.

I would highly recommend to give this game a chance, and stop blaming every F2P game publisher for trying to make some money from free game, developers, maintenance and servers costs A LOT OF MONEY, and the game has to improve over years, it is done only because of our money."

2613,Good games.... The long time game on the World Of Tanks Blitz. I like this games.
2614,"very good

2615,Really good graphics
2616,"The game is good. However, Wargaming ruined the credit earning the last few patches. I will give an example a good game with 3,500 damage in a 50 tp tier 9 polish heavy will earn you 15,000-20,000 credits with premium account. A bad game in high tier will be a loss of credits with premium and without you will probs be -10,000 credits or more.

What does that mean if you want to research tanks you will have to play premium tanks to earn credits as you can't earn while grinding them anymore.

Is the game pay to win right now?
Answer:Yes you need premium account and tanks to have a small chance to research vehicles.

Should you play it if you are a free player?
Right now no you will have no good premium tanks or account and you will not earn enough credits to play above tier 6. Even in lower tiers you will still struggle to maintain your credit balance.

If Wargaming reads this:
You must increase the amount of credits earned in the game because what you call balance is killing the game."

Only issue i have about the game is the premium tanks that cost anywhere from 3.5k-20k+ gold, it's annoying and i hate it and if your given the chance to get a decent tank from events or whatever then 9/10 you wont get one. Other than that good fun."
2634,"I hold some reservations about the game. I like it BUT when you are limited to the SE Asia server there are few players online the morning and you have to wait a very long time to battle. If we were connected to a server that allowed access to the US or Europe, then it would be a lot more enjoyable."
2635,"Gameplay is easy to learn, challenging to master - as it should be. And most players you meet will be folks dedicated to the game rather than trolls looking to make others' lives miserable. That's not to say there is absolutely no griefing, or absolutely no hateful language, but overall it's better than some other games I've played. Wargaming did good here and I think should be congratulated for it. Four stars out of five: great idea, good execution, needs more moderation to deal with the rare jerks who go out of their way to be terrible people.

Since this is a freemium game funded by microtransactions, let me add I have not spent a penny on this game, but still have access to the majority of the content. I would say a lot of the premium content is quite reasonably priced, though. And from what I've seen, premium vehicles and ammo aren't a win button in most cases. (My favorite example is a tank with absurd frontal and side armor values and a gun that fires a demolishing three-round burst - but it's balanced by having an underwhelming engine and taking a long time to reload.)"

I have changed tanks before, but match after match, I'm still losing. Last time I've played I have lost 10 times in a row. I feel like the developers really need to balance out the tanks, as a lot of tanks are out-classed by like 5 tanks in the same tier and those tanks everyone plays as. It has been so frustrating that I have decided to give up on the game."

but from tiers 2-10 is littered with ""mommy's credit card""
I don't find this game even worth the effort of a proper review."
2663,more painful than war thunder
2664,i got this game before it was on steam and before 5.5 it was a fantastic game back then but now it feels just to  idk boring or unfair before 5.5 came the low tiers were full of varrity lots of diffrent tanks but now with around 75% of the low tier tanks gone it feels to competitive and grindy but for somebody who wants chaotic battles and has money to spare you will love this game sadly lots of older players are leaving the game but with the old leaving the new join bringing new ideas to a game that once was a game about historical tanks i hope this helps people know more about this games past and want to find more about it
2665,Really fun to get with a group/clan.
2666,"gfhiuvdyfgtfsjgdcuy shit

2667,awesome game
2668,"First off, i want to say, that for a single-player puzzle game, this is absolutely breathtaking. The story line is wonderfully immersive with high graphics 4k texturing and antialiasing, aswell as the occasional nude female, resembling your mother. 10/10 would recommend, and its entirely free-to-play with no in-game transactions, what-so ever. Play this if you want to have a big peen."

2687,"shit game, gimme back my time"
2688,"All round good game , very addictive ."
2689,"sd error . then i download other games and play normally, but wotb is faulty"
2690,"Отыграл в это говно 110 часов. ЗАшел сегодня и вижу что нет ниодного танка и всё сначала, 
ненавижу этих говнарей !"
2691,"In my experiences starting as a new player might be a little bit rough. To be honest I used to play this game a quite long but then i realized this is a long grinding game if I don't use the booster or something. But Hey despite that, there still many event that you can get free tank :3. But Still sometimes matchmaking is not fair or too hard unless you had a good/ premium tank and skill. 7,5/10"
2692,Good game-play and right amount of difficulty for multiplayer
2693,"ok to be fair i played this game only for a short while and here is my stand on this game:

FOR F2P PLAYERS:

pros for f2p players: they give away freebies such as free gold, credits, and premium though it might not be so much stuff its fine as you dont pay money for it so why not. Also as a steam exclusive you will get 7 days of premium and other in-game currency from the bundle.

cons for f2p players: you dont get to experience nice vehicles that usually are insanly good (EX: most of the premium tanks that come back once every few months for around $30s or more worth of real world dollars for in-game cash), plus the grind can be frustrating as premium gives you so many benefits as premium doubles exp and credits, yet you rarely get those benefits. the only thing close to the double exp and credits is the daily 2x exp for one win which is not very good per say.

So basically the grind sucks BUT you get a good amount of freebies BUT as an addition you dont get access to cooler vehicles and you dont get more profit from battles.



FOR P2W PLAYERS:

pros for p2w players: you get access to literally anything if you put your money to it

cons for p2w players: your wallet is empty as every thing can cost up to $30-$100 for a vehicle and some items.

so to sum up free to play can be doable but you will suffer
and for p2w your wallet will be empty but you get everything you can buy (i.e battle pass, event exclusive vehicles, premium vehicles, etc)

For me i do recommend it as WOT:B is a good game just there is a lot of things to tell you to buy stuff and its frustrating, i mean yeah i know they want money but they dont have to put it everywhere on your screen"
2694,This is basically a budget version of World of Tanks if you don't have the money. Oh wait... World of Tanks is free.
2695,Best Job I Ever Had
2696,"Everything about this game is designed to make you spend real money and play the game infinitely. In the 3 hours I played I was constantly harassed by attempts to make me spend money. I felt disrespected. Violated even. 

When you start playing, you're given 2 days of premium free which gives you a huge currency boost. Practically double if not actually double. And still, with premium, the grind is unfathomable. You're forced to work through a tech tree to unlock the tanks you actually want to play. Something I could already tell would take weeks or months. You're also given paths to follow down the tree, naturally, and that means if you decide you want a tank from another side of the tree you have to grind your way there from the fork.

Or.. you can start shoveling money out of your bank account and get everything you want at the drop of a hat. This has got to be some of the worst F2P marketing I've ever seen. Idk if this is considered pay to win but it's definitely pay or grind your life away.

The graphics are dated and boring and the effects are bland. This isn't like Battlefield where you shoot a tank round and there's an explosion. There's just a little *ping* and a voice says ""Good shot!""  Also, I'm pretty sure this is hit scan. No bullet drop, no leading your shots on a moving target. Also, there's RNG involved in your hits. A direct hit might not do anything. Even on a soft spot.

 The 3 hours I played were definitely fun but I don't see any reason to continue."

2708,yes
2709,"Visuals: 6-8 allows for some customization of graphics quality, but overall is an amazingly detailed game
Sound: 8 sound can be really accurate to actual tanks, and it gives the littlest of sound details for added realism
Gameplay: 9 holds up very well, the tech tree and the amount of tanks it gives you to work with can add to your playset, like how some people only master tier V tanks and I master at tier III
Online play/community: an amazing community, rarely can find ""bad"" people on the game"

2735,"I like this game. Its simple, space efficient, and engaging. I'd have to say out of all the wargaming games (not including wows blitz), this one is the easiest to play and learn, however, it is an ""easy to learn hard to master"" type of game. My best advice to people who are struggling is WATCH YOUTUBE VIDEOS! They are so helpful, if you are getting them from a credible creator. It's sort of annoying how many new overpowered tanks there are coming into this game, but, if you're a good enough player, you can combat these with any old tank. It's free and only takes up like 5 GB. I'd give it a shot."

2746,"The fact that you guys made a game that crashes and gets bad connection this often, but more than compensates for that by making me voluntarily play 44 hours in <5 days, constantly think about it when I'm not playing and is more fun than any game I have played (excluding connection problems), it is nothing short of a miracle in game design.

Also, the fact that it's free and not PTW so far!? \(^v^)/

2761,GAME KONTOL
2762,"Lay out of Tank information all over the place. You have to click here for this information and then look and click another place for additional information about the tank and so on. They dont make it easy just to see if its a light medium or heavy tank. They need to make it easier and make it where it is all in one place and with one click to find it. Also what class of tank it is, more information like is the tank a scout, a tank destroyer, a support tank and so on, what is the tank mainly use for... Also when you make a video, like gravity, show us nubs how to set it up, what button does it use to lift off the ground,.."

Update 9.0:
Wargaming buffs those auto-loaders greatly in tier 10
Like TVP, FV4005, which can dealt >1k damage in 4-6s 
It's unbalanced because they are now low risk high return tank

2777,"Какие в этой игре есть минусы?
1. Профессиональный балансировщик: выиграли 5 боев? Значит следующие 5 сольёте, если только вы не сможете затащить 1 против 7. Часто у ваших тиммейтов будет стата 39-49%, у врагов 50-60%.
2. ""Адекватная"" команда:
- Держимся вместе
-Пошёл н**** чёрт
Такие диалоги вы будете видеть ежедневно, чаще всего от ""статистов"", которые будут агрится на вас чтобы вы не сделали, начиная от вашего пропаха/не пробития врага, заканчивая тем, что у вас на 0,1% хуже статистика, чем у него.
3. Система оценки игроков: Вообще не понимаю смысл от этого, хочешь пожаловаться на игроков? хочи дальше, твоя жалоба будет успешно проигнорирована. 99% всех игроков имеют 4 или 5 звёзд, как бы показывая, что здесь нет дибилов , только топ игроки.
4. Донат: Если раньше он был более менее адекватным, то сейчас wargaming ввели ОГРОМНУЮ кучу доната, ты посмотрел описание танка, посмотрел видео ютуберов, которые говорят: с этим танком вы станете статистом, хотя по ТТХ большинство из премов не сильно отличаются от их аналогов из ветки прокачки. Ты покупаешь его, играешь боёв 15 и понимаешь, что играть также сложно, как и раньше, ибо баланс болт клал на тебя и на твой прем.
5. Постоянный ввод всякого мусора в игру такие как аватары или камуфляжи.
И многое другое, это, по моему, самые актуальные ""болезни"" этой игры.
А какие плюсы? я не знаю
В игоге суммарно около 550 часов потраченных нервов, потеря веры во всё хорошее и понимание того, насколько безответственные разработчики эти wargaming.
P.S. интересно сколько платят ютуберам за рекламу этой ""игры №1""1"
2778,"If my laptop could run WoT I would play that rather than blitz, good game just needs work on UI and input delay as someone who play 200 ping on a daily bases the input delay makes it not fun to play, some features in blitz I would like seeing in WoT that being tournaments

Overall good game if you cant run World of Tanks, if you can run World of Tanks, play that instead"

2800,so after i have played this for sometime i can say its a good game for tank fans and war fans

2804,"It feels like a arcade tank shooter happy fun time week hour kind of game, ya feel???"
2805,"I have been playing World Of Tanks Blitz since 2018 (my profile is Raptor360VX). I had tons of fun when the game was still realitvely new and enjoed it a lot. If I was writing this review 2 years ago I would definetly recommended it. However, this game slowly sufforcated all the fun out of it, the game is filled with toxic re-rolling accounts. The game is mixed among hightly competitive players and casual players who just want to have fun. I myself started to fear about how my statistics looked on my account so I started to worry about everything. The matchmaking that Wargaming presents as balanced just doesn't feel like it. The game is filled with broken tanks and no lack of premium tanks in which you often have to pay to obtain. Unless you are like me and takes a lot of time and effort to try to get a premium time for free during events. 

All in all I had my fun and frustration whilst playing this game. It was a fun ride until the game slowly become twisted into something else. 

Do I think this game suites new players? Perhaps, if you want to downoad this game I won't say that's a sin, but I DO REALLY recommend watching so many tutorials and tips and tricks as you can before trying to play the game. (Such as martindogger, Meadsy69 and Pantouflee, these YouTubers helped me a lot when I was a newbie myself). Players will shame you for anything that is under average statistics. 

If you don't want to become a man who spent over 2300 hours in this game when I really don't have the time, do not downoad this game.

"
2806,"It has very realistic tanks and most everything about the game is great, the graphics are for some people, I feel some people wouldn't like it because of how it'll take 5 shots to kill a tank versus in real life it only takes 1 hopefully, but I think its just perfect."

2828,5/5
2829,"Better balance that World of Tanks, more arcade-like, easier to play.
"
2830,"this game has to sides: one being the pay 2 win version, the other one is the free to play. these 2 sides are 4 parallel universes apart. if you are f2p this game needs grind like no tomorrow which can be boring for a long time but if you are a p2w player u can just show your wallet and get to the top tier in a matter of seconds. but that does not mean that u will win every time. this game actually needs a lot of skill to play correctly.
 the only downside (other than the p2w tanks and the loot box system) is that sometimes your teammates suck and they get deleted right off the bat so you automatically lose. 
overall this is a good game with a lot of different tactics to suit how you like to play. (7/10)"

Crates play is on another level here, you can spend your mom's salary to open 20 crates and get some exp certificates and a week of depression, or you can just wait for a couple of months and get the tank your wanted for reasonable price. I almost never play solo, it's total cancer, my advice to you is just get a toonmate otherwise you have to deal with one more 43% WR scrub in your team."

2890,"Играл сначала в ""большие"" танки, но некст-ген графоний ушёл далеко вперёд, а вычислительные мощности остались на прежнем уровне хДДДДД.
ПЛЮСЫ: 
1) Нетребовательное железо - может пойти на компе за 10к рублей.
2) Можно играть на планшете и на компе - суммируется прогресс
3) НЕТ АРТЫ хДДДДД
4) Бои по 7 минут 7х7 - более динамично и меньше стоялова (ну может и не такой для кого то плюс)

5) И ПРЯМ САМЫЙ НЕВЕРОЯТНЫЙ ПЛЮС - это политика в отношении доната (голды, премов и премиум аккаунта). 
В ""больших"" танках у меня был 1 прем 8 лвл (за донат), и несколько нерелевантных семёрок. 
А в ВОТ БЛИЦ - с донатом в 200 рублей: Ис5, ФЦМ 50т, Т34 (американский тт), Тайп 59, и 2 премиализованных восьмёрки Ру 251 и ФВ301, и около 15 премов 5, 6, 7 левела (ну я не очень на них играю). + Где то с полгода я играю с прем аккаунтом на постоянку, ни потратив на это ни рубля.

Ну и МИНУС единственный (и вполне очевидный - как и у всех бесплатных игр) - токсичное и очень донное по скиллу комьюнити."

Drop $100 in this game, you will win most matches.
Drop $100 is War Thunder and you will get killed in an 8.0 jet by my dumb ass in a 2.3 I-16 baby prop plane from Harbor Freight.
I played 6 hours of this game, and without fail, every match I got instantly killed by some brightly colored fuck in his fancy pay-to-win super tank from across the map. Worst 6 hours ever spent."

2905,"Very fun and cool game but the KV-2 is ""too"" powerful, i did a 1 shot kill to a Firefly Sherman and he was saying ""What?, How?"" the whole game."
2906,"I would say, the community sounds very Republican from my experience. I may just be the bad apple but I mean when you do bad, people will know. You will see on that text box on your screen of how they feel about your family and yourself. But if you may be a bit normal and casual, I have stayed sane by just seeing fat numbers drop on your opponents health. Some of the events such as that Space event and Madness have been reallyyyyy fun. That part I do enjoy. But still, sweaty bois take those arcade style game modes as if it were their last game. I've had countless hours on mobile and I think even more on my other steam account. Take note, since it is a free game, be sure that you may be tempted to get them premium tanks and boosters. Nonetheless, this game is great. It had character based on its community. Very very flawed in its character, but in a way feels human. Every game and everyday will be in fact a different experience. 8/10 am still currently playing this game."

Keep a distance from this game it is my advice."

2960,"I play this on PC/Switch 

**Here's the tips for new player***
 
LT - Fast , Easy to flank TD but lacks of Armor (Best for Spotting Enemies Checkpoints)

MT - Balance Tanks , Easy to Flank HT & TD (Best for Offensive, Supporting or Spotting)

HT - Better Armored , Lacks of Speed and rotation (Hulls/Guns) 
Best for Defense against Enemies 

TD - Highest Dmg , Medium of Armored, Lacks of Speed & Rotation and Best for Supporting your teams."

2965,I like wot Blitz because it has you go back to the old days and work your way up and if you see yourself playing it for awhile the premium account to get more exp is helpful but not mandatory
2966,"it has come to my attention that i've played an additional 63 hours, and therefore whatever this review used to be is henceforth deemed irrelevant

made me only slightly misogynist"
2967,"Just play it !

2968,"Hey, Your tired of World of Tanks and its shitty RNG? Well you should try out World of Tanks Blitz! What's the difference you ask? In World of Tanks to get good you spend 20$. In this game there are only bots that get harder and harder to kill with each tier you advance and as a mini version of WOT, You only need to spend 5$ to get good! ITS SHIT. :)"
2969,I didnt know tanks could become such dangerous snipers
2970,nice game =)

For people that can click past the Loot crates, FOMO events, and other overused mobile app gimmicks; there is a solid arcade style multiplayer tank game here.  Seriously, sit down for an hour and get 10 matches in.  It's a good game for people that can't commit an hour to a single match."

3010,So far this is a great game.  If you use your head and use the tank how it is made you will be fine.  Take a paper armoured TD into the middle and you will get to watch the other people fight really fast.

3075,"I rarely comment, since the last MMO I played.  This game is STILL NOT Pay-2-Win.  You actually require skill to be a good player.  Even if you purchased the best tank.  You can be just as bad as if you never put any money into this game.

The game takes effort and skill to be good at."
3076,I made the switch from the original WOT to this one.  Since I started playing this I've been here frequently and having more fun as I grind up the tank food chain.  A different pace and to get away from the the ones that cry and belly-ache frequently from the other games.

3081,"If one is to attain a truly historical sense of tanks, as well as aircraft and naval vessels in one game instead of three separate games. If one is to grasp the immensity and raw power of these beasts of Kruppstahl and Stalinium then this game is not for you. Boys come here to play tanks, but men... they play War Thunder to live tanks. If you are a man then prove it and choose the path of righteousness, of glory, of unfettered conquests. But if you're just a boy then play with your Tonka Tanks in World of Tanks Blitz, just know you have chosen an unwise and dishonourable path. May you find victory in every battlefield, may your enemies perish in your presence, and may you conquer to your heart's content, blessed be my friend."

3101,"Honestly the game isnt the best out there , if you manage to get past the initial part and the more grindy parts you could find it rather enjoyable especially with friends or even a clan.
 
Been playing world of tanks since 2011 and stuck to the blitz version because I consider it way better for the smaller battles where one person's input can matter a lot more and even if the teams often drag you down , its still possible to carry at times , unlike in 15v15 matches , as well as less p2w imo , not the best balance , but not the worst either. 

There's a lot of events , with the best ones towards the end of the year like twister cup , black friday and new year , so there's plenty of opportunities to get free premium tanks or gold to purchase said tanks later on , crates are a huge nope though , its pure gambling and absolutely never worth the money , apart from the new years gold boxes , that 10% drop rate is way above everything else they offer in crates.

All in all its neat , might not look as stunning as the pc variant but worth trying only if you dont have anger issues and problems dealing with bad teammates xd"

3131,"Pay to win shit. Hitboxes are a disaster. The game is completely dominated by camping pussies and pay to win retards. Game is very inconsistant in its realism and its very annoying. The games ""balancing"" of tanks is laughably bad. Absolute Shit DONT download this game. But hey, at least its better than War thunder -_-"
3132,this game cool but its like pay to win to get gold but its still good games
3133,tank go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
3134,gud gem
3135,"open your wallet

3144,Quick games compared to WoT and less upkeep.
3145,"Played for a bit, not that great imo"
3146,"Easy to learn, easy (but not too) easy to progress and generally fun two play as a good, team and strategy game."

3152,"Ive played this game for a good amount of time, and let me tell you from experience, it's good, but kinda good. Let me explain. It's good in the sense that one, its free, two, u dont need a super computer to run the game, three, awesome variety, really open game with a lot of customisation, a lot of breathing room to chose your play style, four, easy to learn game mechanics, its not rocket science like SOME games... *cough* cough* arma 3 *cough*cough*.... six, tons of new content, wargaming, gotta hand it to ya, your really grinding this game, never gets old, always new tanks, modes, maps so on so forth. Speaking of grinding, it, well yeah, its pretty demanding in terms of grinding the game, but trust me, dont focus on getting the next tank or turret or gun or whatever, just have fun and those things will come. Seven, and this is very debatable, and ive seen some other reviews talking bout this, the people that play this game can be a little, idk how to say it, just downright stupid. And I dont mean only like intellectually challenged, but like just, you just dont wanna say anything, just like, stop. But those people dont really have a huge impact on the game, they can spam the chat all they want, doesnt really make a huge difference. Eight, its FREE, and I think this is a huge bonus, please, please, people stop saying the game is P2W, I have been playing for a good amount of time, havent payed a single penny and am at the same level as people who have payed. The ONLY, and ONLY ONE, exception is the Annihilator, I will have to agree on that one, cmon wargaming you can do better than that one. Nine, and this is a little bit of a down side not if your reading this, cus your gonna be on PC most probably, playing with PC players as a mobile player is gonna suck. Now dont get me wrong, some of the best WoTB players are mobile players, but... Why do I even need to explain this!? They are PC PLAYERS, its just that, they are there, and there is a large difference between them and Switch and Mobile players. 

Overall, just try the game, its free, isnt 55 GB *cough*cough* WoT PC *cough*cough*, its really easy to run, you can play whatever play style you want, and for Wot PC players thinking of coming to WoTB, guess what folks, their aint no artillery."
3153,its a fun game shoot other tanks explode tanks its awesome!
3154,"Fun, thrilling, edge of your seat play action. Or if you're like me, fall off your seat."
3155,5/10
3156,i love how i play and then learn about the tank
3157,suck
3158,its great
3159,"Ez clutch, play this if u suck at warthunder"
3160,"Amazing Game that provides hours of Fun and Joy!
Totally recommended"
3161,fun
3162,"So this game is good for the most part, but new players face bots for the first 5k battles which makes them much worse once they get to high tier game play. Players can instantly purchase high tier tanks(8-10) and ruin many games by not understanding the simplest parts of the game. The game is good but yeah it could be way way better!"
3163,"when you do absolutely nothing, the game gives zero reward. even if it is not my fault. please change that.
"
3164,its a hell of alot smaller then base  WoT
3165,
3166,Like the gameplay but aiming with the xbox controller seems to be to sensitive.
3167,"atfer 10 hours of play all stats has deleted and i was logged out and respawn with 8 bettles and all tier I tanks

but gameplays is great.... like old WoT in years 2013-2014
"
3168,"Good game for PC , mobile."
3169,"the game is OK but sometimes it gets boring, it makes me want to commit sudoku but atleast i had a fun 3 hours of playtime with definetly no struggle whatsoever. But i have to say the controls are really forgetable sometimes"
3170,Very fun
3171,pog game
3172,"Forget the original ""World of Tanks""! This version is much more fun, less confusing & less annoying. A good military tank MMO & PVP, to say the least."
3173,"I have been playing this game for numerous years, and I still love it."
3174,very nice
3175,"Its alright, i prefer warthunder i think but its not bad aat all, just sad that you need to grind a lot to get the cool stuff, and especially in this version of the game it really is the more you pay the cooler stuff you get and sometimes the better sstuff you get"
3176,"just installed it, battle button is greyed out, I can only enter settings or tech tree. Once in the tech tree I leave that screen. No user feedback no information. what is going on?"
3177,"Potato
"
3178,Excellent online Free game. Need continuous internet for playing
3179,QuadTrilion Nice~
3180,Good
3181,nice game i think
3182,"I LOVE THIS GAME! The accuracy of the tanks modeled after real tanks is outstanding and the action takes you right into the dirt and the muck. Shells whizzing by you, and the pressure you feel maneuvering while your in the middle of a match, are the details that will have you hooked! MUST PLAY!!!"
3183,Love the game
3184,Decent Game to pass time. But once you get to tank V its hard to advance without pay to play. But game matches you up with same level tanks so even staying in a level I or II tank is fine. Not sure when everyone sees the toxic playes.  Have not really seen anyone chatting.
3185,shit show
3186,"387 hours is not accurate, i think its more around the 2000 hour mark (Lol)"
3187,"i played this game sense it first came in 2014 very fun game lots and lots and lots of tanks to unlock go's from 1930's to 1970's tank for USA,Germany,USSR,U.K,Japan,China and Europe it's a must get and it's for free."
3188,best
3189,Amazing <3
3190,fun game good graphics
3191,Its good ig
3192,good game if you have 2 dads
3193,"250 ping in europe server and don't have singapur server
"
3194,strategy game depends on the brain and tank specific things wow!
3195,"Pay to win idiotic game 
I have played this game for six! years an seen how it ruined into pay to win game where skill doesnt help you at all! Rng makes everything even worse.
Oh you have been hard scoping someone for 10s too bad you haven't spent any money on our game you gonna miss now
Oh you havent bought any premium tanks well you gonna die because everyone with premium will penetrate you
Trash game sidescraping doesnt even help you anymore not any angles  because if there is a premium tank he will find a way to penetrate."
3196,"As you can see, I've wasted most of my life on this game, and believe when I say this: Only play this game if you have money on you. You can be semi-good with non Premiums but the learning curve is really shitty. The community is full of toxic, shit for brains 12 year olds that are permanently attached to  phones and to their mothers credit card, you might meet some 40+ nationalist boomer that will praise how the past was the ""good old days""."
3197,"YEs
"
3198,"Quick, great game play and cunning players. Love the upgrades. Hoping for a Swamp map or Forest map.  You won't regret playing."
3199,as a f2p game is not bad but sometimes like more p2w game and make things hard for f2p
3200,fast moving
3201,"This game would be fantastic, if it weren't for a large group of players who are extremely hostile towards other players. Not recommended for kids."
3202,"Short battles, 7v7, and good players to battle with and against! Time is short in the real world so a great satisfying distraction to forget about everything going on around you for a while... ;-)"
3203,good
3204,Blitz is great. Plenty of video on Youtube saying how to play. And the range of tanks is amazing
3205,a bit pay to win and it can be a bit of a grind to level up especially if your trying to get a tank higher than tier V but generally a fun casual version of world of tanks
3206,Fun 10/10 graphics 8.5/10 community 9/10.
3207,Good game
3208,"top

3209,"the game is trash, have bad connection server, so many bot, hope this game has been fixed. the most important to fixed is the server connection

3212,good game spoilt at times by fellow players
3213,yes
3214,"Decent Fun Game, enjoy playing it when I'm bored of my main games. Could use some improvements, but great game still."
3215,well this game good for low spec pc
3216,cool
3217,"Worst game I’ve ever fallen victim to getting addicted. Predatory pay-to-win tactics and lootbox economics create a toxic environment that encourages players to interact with each other negatively, making it nearly necessary to turn off chat (or have balls bigger than Stalin) to have any amount of fun. 

10/10, would never buy anything from Wargaming ever again! :)"

3223,This game was an absolute treat to play because it starts off playing with bots and it progressively
3224,"Guys, this game is awesome, trust me just try, and u will non-stop play this game. !!!"
3225,nice but miss the old tech tree
3226,it's fun to play but sometimes it can be a pain to try and even do stuff and you can easily lose nearly all your progress by accident.
3227,"good game but ping is bad

3230,"the game is fun for me, I don't really p2w but i really enjoyed the game"
3231,"great game

3232,its a real good game PLAY OR ELSE I GET YOU IN HELL
3233,"Balance in matchmaking doesnt exist. They keep pushing ""balance"" updates, but yet things only get worse. This game desperately needs some kind of skill based matchmaking system."
3234,"Solid tank game that has it's share of trash players that'll make you want to pull your hair the better you get and realize how bad everyone else is. Overall though, it's fun and the selection of tanks are plentiful."
3235,nice
3236,nice game
3237,Fun Game. No big wait before the game starts. You can't get lost in the maps.
3238,"its good
"
3239,"Greatm team  playing  game
"
3240,fast paced and enjoyable. also very challenging competition. over great game to revisit.
3241,Good game for relaxing from cs go :D but made to spend money...
3242,"mno cuz with every update and new modes cycles (uprising,mad games etc) the game lets muppets with under 500,1k,2.....5...10k battles to drive to t10 and make a shit show there. plus the selling of crates its a total fiasco and the game in last 7 years lost its future."
3243,"
The game is focused more on geting money so premium tanks are better and it destroys balance. On the top tiers are showing much more players that just started the game and paid for the tanks so thats destroing the fun in the game. 
But you should at least play it."
3244,dont play asia server  all it have is only pain by nub player.
3245,gud gam
3246,Archetype of a Paytowin-game and the Matchmaking is the worst I've ever experienced in any game! Don't even try it. This game sucks!
3247,Fun game with quite a lot of strategy. The pay to win is a little questionable but skill is the most important.
3248,Best game
3249,its a fun game !!
3250,How did he hit me i was behind a wall: the game
3251,"Have been in the WoT train for 10 years, this is better than the actual game oof, both are pay to win as hell tho, gotta make that moola"
3252,XD
3253,nice
3254,"fun
"
3255,"Game itself is great. War Gaming's business practices not so much. That said i feel out of all of their games this one is the most generous to the players, often giving free gold, event tanks, etc. The crew system is much less complex and tedious compared to regular WOT. Equipment for tanks stay once you unlock them, even if you sell the tank. Overall I have had a lot of fun in this game, if you plan on spending money on it i highly recommend the battle pass as you get the best value for your dollar assuming you finish it."
3256,govno <3
3257,"bruh pay 2 win
"
3258,Hmm...Maybe
3259,"""Pay To Win"" no bots in your team when matchmaking, high exp gain each round guaranteed 55-60% winrate under premium Subscription.
""No prem sub"" 50% of your team in mm is bots, 50% less xp gain each round and guaranteed to have 40% winrate against premium players. 
"
3260,Good game.
3261,Great Game Great Physics Def play
3262,"game is filled with bots now since its pay to win and noob friendly, but as a child I loved tanks from WWII, literally only reason why I still play."
3263,Pretty cool I guess.
3264,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa good game
3265,","
3266,"This game has gotten worse and worse with each new release. Now its full of bugs, ghost shells, point blank range with no effect, can take up to 40 seconds to spawn into game. Outcome of each battle seems to be pre determined, so it stops your shots doing any damage, makes your tank take longer to reload. I spent a lot of time on this game but enough is enough. Finally uninstalled it. Good riddance

Lol, gave it a second chance, this game is really bad now. You can be point blank, whole tank within reticle and your ghost shot does nothing...lmao"
3267,"I could justify recommending a game without skill based matchmaking in 2021 if it also didn't match you with people from different tiers than you. You won't notice games where you're overtiered, but being undertiered means that you'll bounce any shot that isn't to the treads or ridiculously small hitboxes (remember the game has weapon spread on any shot). Tiering becomes noticeable on tier IV, and by tier V you're already facing people with triple your dps and health, not to mention armor values.
Stop forcing 30% of our games to be unfair, and 30% of your games to be a cakewalk"
3268,"well Blitz is the hottest multiplayer tank game for mobile devices. Read our World of Tanks Blitz beginners tips to conquer the competition! If you recently added this pulsating tank blast em’ up to your Android or iOS mobile device, it's essential but you get 
bad teammates takes 2 years to grind to tier 10 for a average player"
3269,wot in not-p2w
3270,cool
3271,"So, first lets talk about how this the game's connection is, i had to quit the game and log into it at least 2 times everyday because the connection is so bad. Secondly, wtf is wrong with tanks that are bought with real money and gold? They are legit so Op, fix this shit ASAP pls

3281,"This game is fixed as you go from more than vii level,  they (the code of game)  make sure you loos a lot so you have to buy there shit."
3282,yes
3283,Its not that bad. You can play on PC its eazy.
3284,Good game but too many noobies that won't learn the game. Player is not toxic but cancer as their play style will cause you to lose all your games.

3291,This is one of my go to games. I love being able to login and quickly get to blowing up things. It is so much fun.
3292,Very fun sort of arcadey game to play. Nice hitpoint system although can be unbalanced at times for certaion tanks.
3293,ha poggers
3294,By far the best tank game out there.  Much better than the original world of tanks.
3295,it just fun
3296,noice
3297,"Surprisingly as fun as I remember when I played it on my phone, but with PC controls it feels much much better, not to mention it's a lot faster to pick up compared to standard World of Tanks, plus it seems a lot less grindy which is a big plus to me. Would recommend if you're tired of playing PC WOT and need something a little different but with the same formula you already know."
3298,Good Game

3304,it plays well and easy to pick up the options
3305,"The game just seems too bland, you got to spend hours to get any where, and It just doesn't seem nearly as detailed as War Thunder, if you like detail get war thunder, if you like simplicity then this might be for you."
3306,"I shoot da tanks, bom bom. Great fun"
3307,Every Game has Issues..that said its a great game. has short matches with quick to action gameplay. loads of tanks to choose and a good player base to support its Years. still worth a Download.
3308,"I played this game about a year ago, and decided to see where it is today.  The new tank interface is INCREDIBLY unstable.  Tracking with the gun is impossible while moving.  That makes sitting still and sniping the only viable option, and that is as fun as taking a nap.  I am done."
3309,"The firsts tiers are where you get more fun, but when you play with tier 4 or more all the people are just tryharding and wanting to get more kills and it becomes a game where you cant play it for fun."
3310,pay to win hell yeah the best game if you are a milionare dont play the game just for fun cuz ur gonna get aids
3311,"amazing game, i love the fact that you can play it on lower end devices and it's only 3GB of storage"
3312,I seriously LOVE this game. I played it years ago on mobile with some friends and I actually enjoyed the game and loved every second of playing it. I found it on steam while I was browsing for some games to play. MAN when I launched the game it just took me back man. Don't even know what else to say. I had so much fun playing this and still have fun playing it today. Phenomenal Game.
3313,"i cant ever get a good team ever. i lost 30 battles in a row and 500k credits. But tnere are those good battles in between.my game freezes up untill i die this has happend 4 times in a row. AND I GET KICKED OUT OF THE GAME AS THE MATCHED STARTED. BEING PENETRATED IN THE MOST ANGLED PART OF THE KING TIGER, MISSING POINT BLANK ROUNDS WHILE STATIONARY, I CANT GET AWAY FROM THE STUPIDEST PEOPLE ON PLANET EARTH, THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN WAITING IN QUEUE THE LONGEST SHOULD BE FIRST IN BATTLE"

other than that 10/10"
3329,"yes, that is awesome game.. tank upgrade cost much higher."
3330,Dont play. It depressing like League of Legends. (TwT). Its an alright game
3331,"Yes I recommend this game, but only if you're looking for a game that will require a lot of effort and personal skill-building. The RNG is troll, there are a great many OP premium tanks at practically all tiers (tier 7 in particular), and knowledge of every tank in the game (several hundred) takes a long time to acquire and use to your advantage. If you're looking for a game that will be a relaxing and easy experience, this ain't it, chief."

3337,"dont play this game unless you have money to burn because the grinding takes forever when you dont spend money on it and the match making is terrible. i highly recommend playing a game with better development and is kind on the players. so again, unless your willing to spend money on this game to advance in the tec tree at higher teirs its not worth your time."

3352,"the battles can sometimes be frustrating with over powered tanks, and inexperienced players however platooning with people and training rooms makes up for it.

3363,"I love this game.

I have put days and days and days into it. Its fun and challenging. I would recommend this game. But I don't recommend it because I want Wargaming to try and improve the game for the player base. And not just improve the rewards you get when opening loot crates. No. I'm talking about the inability of the company to deal with bad players. Now I don't mean noobs. No, I mean players that go out of their way to ruin a game for others. These people will try and block you in with their tank and not let you move for the entire game. Its incredibly frustrating. The trouble is that even if all players report them, nothing happens. They are never banned or suspended. It's getting to the point where I just don't want to play the game anymore. It gets me too frustrated."

3450,"I rate the World of Tanks Blitz versions very positively, there is no artillery, the maps are small, there is only action in every battle, every camper is unlucky in this version : D additionally this version of the tanks has very low hardware requirements.   Recommend !!!!"
3451,"game sucks shit, rigged for coiner and one side to win 90 percent of time. Would be better if no teams either. Game is also rigged with AI that can't be kill.  Game denies your shots while allowing the enemy to hit you with 1 shot kills. Funny how you can shoot at nothing yet it locks you out from targeting the enemy with a round. Totally rigged scenarios that are predetermined before every battle. Easy for game to control who wins or loses by where your rounds do damage or not. Game also promotes players with low number of battles versus those who play a lot. Battle wins are a joke as the game algorithm constantly places one team at disadvantage through platooning and experience and premium tanks on one side to allow wins.  The one good note on game is it kills time.
"
3452,It's got tanks. Nothing else matters.
3453,very gud gejm
3454,IT IS ABSOLUTE CUBE
3455,"Solid gameplay and positioning, Bad customer support experiences with WarGaming Inc. Game could use some more weeb stuff and WarGaming Inc could use their customer support fired and the whole website user interface scrapped and replaced with one that actually possesses  an 'other' category for creating a ticket. All tickets are ignored anyways even if the existing categories weren't for dumb shit like balancing the consumables. Overall if you liked Blitz and are thinking about trying the main WOT's game, don't bother, you will be disappointed."
3456,"Yeah, it's not quite as frustrating or soul crushing as War Thunder, which I played for many years, but the graphics and controls positively suck. Play it if you've got nothing better to do. I mean, it's FTP, right?"
3457,Fun game :D

3465,"I've sunk more time and money into this game than I'd like to admit. This game is slow and tedious at first, but when you reach higher tiers, the gameplay becomes more interesting. The most glaring problem with this game is the pay-to-win factor, but that's just kind of expected with a free mobile game. I recommend this game, but be prepared to sink a lot of time into it before it gets interesting."
3466,goood games but nerf the premium thank please
3467,Disconnect personal performance/reward from team performance/reward.

3480,its nice
3481,I recommend this because its fairly good but i cant even play because the game keeps crashing when connection to the server makes me very mad and impossible to play
3482,matchmaking is unfair and the too much Paid to win
3483,fun
3484,"I do prefer this mobile version of Wot, because the map it has is much more smaller, makes it even simpler to play, both games on PC and mobile are great overall."
3485,"The game requiring to lot of donate to have a fun.  Also, it is more casual than original World of Tanks. The skill does not solve anything - only random. All tanks almost the same. Most of them never being made in the real. So deleting the game was a wise chose."
3486,"its a ez pay 2 win game if  u buy crates 1% drop chance of a good tank
it is simply a gambling game for tanks this game should be banned"
3487,cool game!
3488,"""On August 1st, 1927, the Nanchang uprising laid the foundation of what later became the Chinese Red Army. From 1937 to 1945, it was fighting against the Japanese invaders, and in 1948 it was reformed into People’s Liberation Army. Right now, it is one of the strongest military forces in the world."" which is complete BS as it never fought the japanase and cowardly sat back while the real nationalists did the dirty work 

Plus this game just sucks if you want to burn money then go ahead"
3489,"Tanks go brrrrr.
Tanks actually existed (most of them)
Microtransactions out the wazoo tho :("

3497,Pay to win . nuff say
3498,JUST GOOD WHY I NEED REVIEW?
3499,"Due to the recent update 9.0, a lot of the faster tanks got nerfed. I play faster tanks more often than slower and powerful tanks. As the slower and more powerful can catch or hit faster tanks easier now, I don't see much value to playing faster tanks.

On that note, certain tanks will be made less valuable while still in the same category. I'd use my WZ-113 as an example, on paper it is very similar to the WZ-121, or it used to be. It is a heavy, but it was a fast heavy, and could be treated more like a heavy medium tank. Speed was one of it's greatest pros but not anymore. It'll have to play like most other heavies, and it's gonna lose against other heavies in a slugging match.

I don't like the current direction Blitz is going. It certainly feels like it's favoring heavies more and more, not like it wasn't already, but it's more apparent."
3500,"Fun game,   good community, very good graphics"
3501,This game is fun. Its super fun with others
3502,Decent game.
3503,amazing
3504,It is super fun.
3505,"pathetic game. Use money to win a single tire. Stupid game. Can arrange an unequal team. Plus there are players and not dyeing, fixing it immediately. Pathetic face. If Kit Khun Game  Really good  Both organizing equal teams to play normal and across the name, stumbling upon the worst player job and chasing the value, bumping up the game as well.  Mamkai is now a pay-to-win game.  Mamdu sees the lottery and loses a lot of respect for most of the players.  Pay 19.99 USD to win?  Pretty page with comments from people who like to play world of tank blitz. wg edit too.
"
3506,Tonk go Bonk
3507,yippee-kee-yay
3508,nice game
3509,"Honestly, World of Tanks Blitz is a lot better than the main World of Tanks. It's much more balanced, and you can actually play a match and survive without losing all your credits. However, since it's a free to play game, they expect you to pay money to get better rewards than what you're already getting. But hey, the free battlepass thing is still a good way to get what you need to move along."
3510,"This game is perfect for people who love war combat that isnt just guns like COD: Warzone. This game is a fun mix of battle strategies, grinding, and high power tanks. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who has an interest of blowing other people up with high power explosive tank shells"
3511,One of the best games with teams in Panzer :)
3512,"хорошая игра,но есть довольно токсичное комьюнити"
3513,"I don't recommend this game at all under its current state.  If you care about actual skills in a game this isn't for you.  Winning events and regular matches based on players having skills such as reading team lineups, reading a map, specific tank strengths and weakness and what roles to play those tanks in.  The prizes in the monthly events this game has started having are almost given away.  As long as you pay the $4.99 for a ""Premium Pass,"" or more accurately, an easy pass, you're almost guaranteed to finish the event and win the tank prize.  Also, the tank prize is near the midway point of these events.  The skill grind to win tanks is a thing of the past.  You used to be able to grind to win a prize tank and if you didn't make it, the monetary cost to make up the difference was reasonable.  The loot box system now has you playing chance and gambling on drop percentages for certain tanks.  Another form of skills taking a backseat.  

There have always been bad players at the fundamentals who ""just played for fun"" and winning was a perk.  Nothing wrong with that.  But I feel this new model of rewards is creating a completely new type of player class and driving out the competitive side of the game.  This new class of players is more focused on the easy prizes and gambling elements to the game and less, if at all, on improving their skill set.  Because when premium time, gold, credits, free xp, and tanks are so easy to win, who needs to be good at it?"
3514,good game but quite expensive... but to be honest im a gacha degenerate so this is far cheaper than my other games
3515,"this game is fun
"
3516,",kghjf"
3517,Does not load and freezes-up on connecting.
3518,The game is great. A lot of fun. There is this element of Pay to Win. However it is understandable that they need to make money.
3519,"Przejdźmy do sedna, gra nie jest najlepiej zrobiona. Dlaczego? 
Grafika jest na naprawdę niskim poziomie, wiem że to mobilniak, ale gram na PC w HD i max grafice, niektóre elementy nawet nie mają tekstury tak jak przestrzeń za gąsienicami Challengera. 

Udźwiękowienie jest również nie najlepiej wykonane, gdzie prawdziwe wybuchy i świszczące pociski, piękny odgłos trafienia w pancerz i płonącego kadłuba - brak

Muzyka? praktyczny brak, bitwy są irytująco nudne, to gra dla głuchej czy ślepej osoby? na pewno cierpliwej

dlaczego cierpliwej? Otóż Mechanika gry i pojazdów, o Boże to będzie największa część recenzji, po kolei 
wyobraźmy sobie sytuacje, jedziesz swoim brzydkim jak piorun wie co IS-5 i widzisz wroga, zanim wycelujesz przez nie realistyczny rozrzut na 100m. ogromny czerwony przeciwnik znika jak nie widzialny, magia? Nie, to Twoje wykrywanie, ogromny czerwony Tiger II zniknie jak odjedzie kawałek za daleko

Monetyzacja, to bardzo poważny problem tej gry, ale to bardzo, przykład z IS-5 nie był przypadkowy, otóż jest to czołg premium 8 poziomu, bardzo rzadki, dlaczego ? Musisz wbić X poziom zaopatrzenia klanowego i go kupić za 1500 ""golda"", ja nie widzę w tym problemu, sam takiego mam (specjalny kamuflaż kosztował więcej niż czołg) ale WG już tak. Prawdopodobnie wyświetla Ci się błąd, na pewno przypadek. Reportujesz to w suporcie, pobierają Ci z konta 1500 złota i dają CI nowy czołg premium. Cieszysz się aż zauważasz że dostałeś 50% załogi, a sam czołg zarabia (jego główna funkcja) jak czołg drzewkowy, kiepsko...
Ahh czołgi premium, drogie, zbyt OP, nie wybalansowane za dobrze i to nawet z Anime, gier i własne twory WG, a to wszystko w grze ""realistic WWII battles"", Gravedigger na pewno należał do Axis, pasuje kolorystycznie

Powaga gry, to akurat dość zabawne, otóż opisują się jako gra ""realistyczna WWII"", więc spodziewamy się czołgów. Dostajemy kolorowe kamuflaże za złoto, płatny battlepass o ""nowoczesne"" czołgi które są tylko przeróbkami czołgów które były już w grze, spójrzcie na Titan 150, to zwykły T-150 którego mało kto pamięta bo został usunięty, teraz jest płatny, Smasher to KV2, kryon to Stug. A tryby takie jak Mad Games, Big Boss i Uprising to żart, i to wszystko ""WWII"". Powagi i sensu - brak

A skoro już dodają te OP czołgi to dlaczego ich nie zbalansują? bo nikt by za nie nie płacił
Dlaczego nie dodadzą nam nowoczesnych prawdziwych czołgów jak AMX 56 Leclerc? lenistwo i skąpstwo
Dlaczego tak rzadko aktualizują modele czołgów? lenistwo i dalej skąpstwo
Dlaczego nie dodadzą większych i lepszych map? lenistwo, znów skąpstwo i trochę głupoty, dodali ostatnio nową mapę ale jest prosta i generyczna z wcześniej użytych zasobów.

Podsumowanie? Podsumowanie, WarGaming przygotował sobie ładną maszynkę do czyszczenia kart kredytowej... Twojej Mamy! 
Tak na poważnie gra ma zarobić na młodszych, jest naprawdę tanio zrobiona, serwery są dość słabo ustabilizowane tak jak sama gra. Spędziłem tu trochę czasu i na pewno spędzę ze względu na sam sentyment, ponieważ tylko on mnie tu trzyma. 

ocena gry to: 5.8/10

P.S: aktualizacje głównie dodają tylko nowe kamuflaże i czołgi które później sprzedadzą."

3535,did i play this game
3536,"Good game with good servers. Tanks mechanics are good, Its a mobile game so, its(Blitz) graphics are comparatively lower than proper World of Tanks game. But, you can play both on mobile and PC on a synced account. You can get free gold watching adverts on mobile. Freemium model becomes too steep after Tier 5, forcing you to pay either through money or time. If you have cash to invest you can pay though money and have fun quickly, if you do not have cash to invest you will have to pay through time and long grinds for upgrades. Those who have cash to upgrade will have fun by blowing your tank up while you grind. Occasionally, the devs will throw in free premium for everyone, for few days. Premium account days will make your grind easier, so you can catch up quickly, to those with cash to upgrade. Before investing in upgrade though money or time, try out all tanks types till atleast tier 4. Once you like a tank type that matches your style of play, like fast tank with low armour, slow tank with high damage (sniper role), heavy slow tank with lots of armour, medium a round tank etc. Then, finally chose a final tier tank and invest only on the upgrade path to unlock that final tier tank."

Grifting, preditory, false advertising, micro transactions with hidden microtransactions within to unlock what you thought you were getting:  you think you are buying one thing but in fact you are buying an pay-to-unlock grind for a 3% chance to get a loot box that you then have to pay additional real money to open for another miniscule chance to actually have the thing you thought you paid real money to buy in the first place. You know all the things people hate about microtransactions? This dev/pub said, hold my beer. 

TL:DR

Worse than EA. I know, I know. How is it possible? That was apparently their dying wish. I hope they go out of business."
3549,This is a great quick PVP game that is perfect for anyone who likes tank combat but didnt like the normal WOT
3550,good game
3551,This is the best tank game I have ever played
3552,Painful :)
3553,"Mad game it is basically the only game the Wargaming hasn't ruined yet and still have a dev team that cares about the game.
It is also very fun"
3554,"nice

3556,"This game is very good with a wide variety of tanks and tech trees, and it also can be very fun when you play with friends so get the game it is free.

some rules on how to be a decent player:

dont ram your teammates
dont killsteal
dont be toxic or salty, instead take a break from the game
dont camp at spawn (unless you have extremely bad armour compared to anyone else in the match or you just connected and are being flanked)

some tips:

learn your tanks armour and position it in a way it deflects shots
never leave your team, you can try to lead them but if they dont follow then stick with them
attack majority dont just go for the one guy because its eaiser, thats how you lose
test new upgrades gun or turret upgrades in training rooms because you dont want to lose silver finding out that the upgrade is bad.

that is all and i hope you find this review helpful."
3557,Ja!
3558,"Pretty fun game, more on the casual arcade side of fighting but I still find it enjoyable."
3559,"server lag, always
"
3560,"If you do not want to spend a fortune of your money on a game like War Robots, then this is the best alternative. You buy a tank, and that's it. No upgrading robots, weapons, or pilots. Leave War Robots with the rich kids."

3597,"It's really not the best. Haven't played Blitz much but played the main PC game quite a bit, both are grindy and having a hit points system for tanks (rather than the War Thunder style system where you know out modules and crew) is rather cringe and I personally dislike it."
3598,"Wargaming / Lesta - developers of this game support russian propaganda and soviet alternative history rhetoric. The game in fact is full of it. The same rhetoric is being used today by russia to justify their actions in Ukraine. 
The game is a World of Loot Boxes and Pay to Win crap from developers who are under investigations for money laundering and other crimes by number of countries around the world. Don't give them your credit card number, your email or anything or they will steal your identity for their shady russian business."

3602,"the best tank game :)
"
3603,everything is good.
3604,"Pay to win, my dad spent at this game about 70 hours from mobile and steam summary. Finally i have shown him really good games. Nevermind that game is free, it wants your money really fucking bad. Stay away from this one. If you like armored warfare, try War Thunder."
3605,"This game is the worse tank game i have ever played, the players in the game act like bots and the pure grind just to get a decent tank is stupidly long, also the loot box's are how to get one of the permium tanks are just scams compared to the normal world of tanks game."
3606,"I have been playing this game since childhood. very good, but there are disadvantages. if you think that I will upset you with a sniper, there will be two options: either the projectile will get where you want or it will pass through the tank. if you think that donat does not solve . I will disappoint you there was one event for a tank the so-called destroyer everyone could pass up to half and who will pay extra will pass everything and take the tank. so the tank will tear everything to shreds. there are also imbovye tanks that can be purchased only for money"
3607,"Great game either on PC or mobile, the grind is definitely easier here. Premium tanks are also easier to purchase here as they're relatively cheap and sales are always changed every 2 weeks"
3608,"I have played this game since it came out. It is just an enjoyable game that does not take a lot of hardware to run well. I would recommend this game to anyone but the community can be a little vulgar. Other than that I would say this is the best game I have ever played, in my opinion, as I also have a lot of hours on my iPad before I started on pc. Just pick a good tech line and grind it out. I hope to see you on the battlefield!"
3609,"I wouldnt recommend this game because the developers are cowards and they know it , they make it so you have really no chance of winning because they dont like you telling them the truth so they either ban you or make it increasing difficult to even score high marks, thats how corrupt they are , they are so vindictive and weak they are just like keyboard cowards , they hack the game and expect you to just sit there are stfu fk them"
3610,"As from my journey/experience in this game is just great I've met mutes,nice,high,demonic/possessed people and 
when u do bad there's a high chance someone will put a curse on u or will send u death threats
and I can say this game is p2w (only a little) the real currency here is what they call ""WR"" no matter how much Credits,Gold u have but if u have low WR people will treat u badly(Unless u meet the nice people that has 1.5% chance like getting a Op Tank in Crates) so i recommend playing this game with a friend and all the open clans are mostly dead but u can join active ones in  discord and the minimum requirements is 50% WR  and average damage is 1k Grind otherwise just depend ur  life with rng..... and thats all.

"
3611,"Yes, Good Game"
3612,"Very solid gameplay mechanics, great visuals and maps, overall great game."
3613,yes
3614,"I was an original World of Tanks player from 2010 to 2019. I quit because the main version is so painful to play for even both free players and ""not-pay-so-much"" players. You can search for more problems of main World of Tanks. I don't need to say more.

World of Tanks Blitz, however, solves many problem because some reasons:
1. It doesn't have SPGs, which is less punishment, more enjoyable.
2. There are only 7v7 player per match, with smaller map. It leads to less camping, more shorter match. If you are Classic WoT player, please note that this lead to a lot change in meta, so your favorite tank may not works the same here.
3. The shorter matches also help you focus on your grinding lines more. Because in original WoT, if you are new player and die a lot, you will find a very hard and long time to grind your favorite tanks.
4. WoT Blitz also doesn't require you to research and also purchase the upgrade, you only need to research it. In original WoT, it's a painful path, especially in high tier when you finally researched the gun and found that you don't have enough money for it. You also don't need to research suspension system to increase weight load. They remove the weight load system. Which mean you don't have to research suspension > turret > to finally get the top research gun.

+- It's not really the down part. But in WoT Blitz, if you play on PC, you may encounter against mobile players, which give you a lot of advantage. I think WG have to solve this in long term, or they will burn out mobile players.

Overall, if you are an old WoT player like me and tired of the old shit, give this game a chance. It's not as challenge as, but more enjoyable."
3615,Fun free tanks!
3616,better pay for ugly dog
3617,Blitz is a great tank game requiring skill. It is a lot of fun to play and the graphics are great.
3618,танчики)))))))
3619,hard game to play
3620,"so if you want you can read this and you can quote me:

-This game is the game to play if you want celebration and rewards like good tanks, holiday bundles, or just bundles in general.
-But the game is what I call the least laged-out version of it's big brother 'World Of Tanks' because it is so much fun please play, IT EVEN HAS BETTER ANTI-CHEAT THEN IT'S BIG BROTHER, so play either one if you want to have fun!
-So look at it and it's big bro for fun or this game to, you're welcome for the context!
-One con about it is the account renewal, it's not fun losing your account because you forgot about it.

3651,"World of Tanks Blitz is like a lite version of World of Tanks, but they both have diffrences like crews, historical tanks, camos, platoons of 2 instead of 3. The game has its flaws dont get me wrong like most of the hybrid nation tanks, the shark and what not. But hey most of the tanks have more hp that WoT so you get less punished for mistakes. All around easy to learn game with quick games ready for the go. Sadly most of the overpowered tanks are pay to win but you can play with your tanks advantages. all around fun and easy-ish game, i recommend it."
3652,"When logging in I was told to ""Improve the turret using Combat XP"". However, clicking on research tells me the following: ""Not enough Combat XP. Earn XP in battles, use boosters, or open containers."" 

It shows two buttons: Cancel and To Store. Clicking cancel in this menu causes me to get stuck without being able to do anything but to close the game. Clicking To Store brings you to the store where it shows you a Boost you can buy to get said Combat XP. Except this is useless since when I exit the store I still can't play the game due to everything being grayed out.

I wanted to give it a fair try except it won't even let me use anything but the store so I guess that says enough."
3653,very good
3654,I was never interested in tanks but this game made me
3655,"[h1][u]OVERALL[/u] 👍[/h1]
World of Tanks Blitz is not simply the ""mobile"" version of World of Tanks PC, it's much more than that.

This game is way less a mess than it's big brother.

I have a PC that can run the PC version on max graphics but I still choose to play the supposed ""mobile version"", here is why.


[h1][u]GOOD[/u] ✅ [/h1]

✔️[b]7v7[/b]

👉[i]A lot of players want a 15v15 gamemode, this is really not needed in my opinion, the 7v7 fast pacing games is really what make Blitz unique, less players means smaller maps, which means way less camping, you got into the action instantly and you have to play with your skill and knowledge to make the difference, you don't have to wait in a bush because the situation in your game is not suitatable for you to push.[/i]
__________________________________________

✔️[b]Quick games[/b]

👉[i]Games are usually 2-5 minutes long.[/i]
__________________________________________

✔️[b]No artillery[/b]

👉[i]Unlike WoT PC, there is no artillery in this game and this is perfect, you can push without being punished by some stupid clickers. Artillery is ruining the whole dynamic of battles in PC, when you get focused you just have to hide and wait. there is really no fun to get hit by something across the map while you are powerless.[/i]
__________________________________________

✔️[b]Matchmaking[/b]

👉[i]+1/-1 is the actual matchmaking in Blitz, this means if you play a T6 tank, you can be matched against T6-T7 or / T5-T6 tanks.
Again ... a far better decision than WoT PC which have a +2/-2 mm, good luck playing T8 against T10.

👉Some players will say the matchmaking is manipulated, this is wong, the matchmaking is completely random and yes, you can have some bad luck and encounter a huge lose streak but most of the time the only thing that make the difference is YOU. You have to know when to push, when to retreat, where to aim and you have to learn map awarness, this is very important.[/i]
__________________________________________

✔️[b]Balance[/b]

👉[i]Gold ammunition in Blitz have a better penetration like expected BUT they are dealing less damage so you have to make a choice between doing more damage or increasing the chance to penetrate a tank which is not the case of WoT PC (gold are doing the same damage LOL) this is a huge difference.

👉 Every tank that you acquire have the ""Six senth"" ability, it's a basic mechanic that everyone have in the game regardless of their progression. This ability tells you if you have been spotted by showing you a bulb 3 seconds after you got spotted.  

In Wot PC you have to grind your crew skills on every nation / tank class to get this ability, this is really stupid and mindblowing that Wargaming still not changed this mechanic that everyone should have right at the start.

👉The game is well balanced overall, there is some exceptions to it however.[/i]


[h1][u]BAD[/u] ⛔[/h1]

❌[b]Pay to win[/b]

👉[i]Some tanks like the Annihilator or the Smasher are way too OP and wargaming is doing nothing to balance them, however most of the players who drives these tanks are completely garbage at the game, so if you are a relatively good player you won't have a problem, it becomes one when good players are playing these types of tanks.

This is a free to play and a niche game, Wargaming are the only ones on the market so this is unfortunately inevitable, they can do what they want unless there is huge complains coming from the community.[/i]
__________________________________________

❌[b]Updates rate[/b]

👉[i]This game have approximatively 1 update every 1 month and ~2 weeks, you might think it's good but the updates are most of the time balances changes. There is 1 new map and 1 or 2 tech tree tanks per year. Considering the amount of money they gather with this game, the content is really lacking.
__________________________________________

❌[b]Lack of features[/b]

👉[i]Blitz still miss one of the best feature of the PC version which is the ""Marks of Excellence"", Wargaming still find some excuses about hardware limitation but I would call it lazyness. 

👉Missions to unlock new tanks are also lacking in the game, there is not enough exciting ways to unlock tanks for free. [/i]"
3656,Good fun while it lasts which is for a few weeks and then the premium tank ambush begins.
3657,"Another developer team to use ""players"" in matches.

There is a common deceptive tactic employed by gaming companies as of the last few years. They randomly generate fake player names (or copy real player names) and use them for their AI. So your match will be filled with ""players"" that are actually NPCs. This looks like ""JohnnyBlaze17"" and ""ghost_ryder"" but they are bots. I've watched them over many games and they will always follow me into games no matter what tier tank I'm using or what game mode I select.

My issue is that they are tricking you into thinking you're playing with real people most of the time. You're not. Spectate them during a match and they all behave similarly (and stupidly). Real players stick out and they are far and few inbetween. 

Shame on companies who use bots disguised as player names. Deception."
3658,fun and easy to understand
3659,"I love everything, overall great experience.
"
3660,Free Game.  and it is fun.  just to get it hours of fun.. everyone playing it will feel liek it is a mobile game. but hey it is a open world game. where you are on team and kill other ... and it is all set down to fun and fast games
3661,"great game. well balanced in terms of fairness, and you don't need to spend money to be good!"
3662,its a great action game most people should play

3670,"Played this on my old phone a year ago, and find the game quite nostalgic, I would recomend it"
3671,The tank can shoot so that's a good start
3672,"it was a good game until the devs decide to destroy it (p2w, matchmaking not equilibrate,servers of sh*t, lot of bugs not corriged since 3 years) if you are a new player you will find it fun but you will suffer to get advanced tanks without spending a lot of money so dont play too much this game if you don't want to throw your money from the window"
3673,the gameplay is great and i expected it to lag on my mac but it did not
3674,Fun to play but server is run by hamster on wheel
3675,Great mobile platform
3676,"70% of the matchmaking if you are solo player are meant to be lose no matter how good you are, you always got ganked and die instantly, the best part your team does nothing to help and yolo to enemy team and die too. Not to mention so much idiot buy high tier tank using gold but didn't know how to use it which make your lose streak even bigger than before. Stay away from this game. The worst part is consumables,provision, bullets and camouflage that constantly drain your silver and the game is dumb enough not to tell you directly so you always wondering why always losing silvers every time you play even if you win and become MVP, you still lose silver especially in higher tier rank tanks. Free to play, pay to progress.

Oh, don't forget you will be matched by higher tier tank most of the time once you reach tier IV and will increase even more lose streak than ever. If you hate yourself very much then this is the game for you"
3677,"great game.
"
3678,"TL;DR - Grindy, MOBA-shooter hybrid. Aggressive (but mostly ignorable) monetization.

This is a great game [i]if[/i] you have a lot of time to play. The game is meant to be played infinitely. An average player will never unlock everything you can earn for free. There are [i]so many[/i] tanks it's unlikely you'll ever play them all.

Battles are 7v7 and last only seven minutes. Queues are short. Typically taking thirty seconds or less. So you are always getting in and out of games quickly.

You'll be up against quite a few bots when you first start playing. This is a big help for new players. Gives you time to learn without being utterly owned.

There's an entirely optional rating system. (If ladders happen to be your thing.) Personally, I find the system to be unfair. I consistently lose more rating points on losses than I gain on wins. I need around 3-4 wins to make up for a [i]single[/i] loss. The only reason I play this mode is to complete the occasional mission that requires it.

There's also a ""fun mode"" game-of-the-week. Each offers an alternate set of rules. Usually centered around giving your tank ""powers"". Sometimes, they change-up the physics or add new maps. You never really know. Some modes you'll like, and some you will [i]hate.[/i]

Progression is performance-based. In other words, you gain more credits/xp if deal lots of damage. (And you gain a [i]lot less[/i] when you don't.) Even more when you win. Frustrating for newer players, but highly rewarding for experienced veterans.

A premium account is vital for anyone putting serious time into the game. The extra credits and xp you gain will help greatly with the grind to tier X. (Which is the endgame.) It's the only ""must have"" purchase.

The game is constantly bombarding you with special offers. Some are good. Some are bad. You need to compare whatever they are selling to the standard price of everything included.

Premium and collector tanks are fun, but not necessary. There are a [b]TON[/b] of them. You'd need an obscene amount of money to buy them all. Which you shouldn't. As many of them aren't worth the price. However, premiums do have a bonus to the credits they earn per battle. So, it can be useful to have one.

There's a lot of nuance to the game. There's a ton of rules and tricks the game will not tell you about. I strongly recommend reading up if you want to be good. Check out the official YouTube page for great beginner tips. https://www.youtube.com/c/WorldofTanksBlitz_official/videos

Lastly, I want to warn you: [b]Stay away from the loot boxes![/b]

The free boxes are fine. Never spend money on any of the boxes. They are a rip-off! Your chance of getting anything good is slim. Your chance of getting something useless (or at least, not worth the price) is [i]very[/i] high. Buy only stuff that doesn't have a random roll involved."
3679,"quite poggers

3680,not bad
3681,Tanks go boooooooom
3682,kinda p2w tbh but i want yall to experience this shit too
3683,Don't worry we don't have artillery here. No more annoying ass class
3684,after many hours as u can see i finally decided to delete this game for good the game is unplayable its filled with kids at every tier especially in tier 10 because all of them have premium tanks that they bought with their mamas visa most of the pro players quit the game also and the youtubers know where this is heading and its not a good place its just a place for kids to yolo or camp the whole game and be no help then blame u for the loss and today i broke after losing 24 matches in a row and uninstalled this near death game
3685,I LOVE THIS GAME but can it give more free stuff pls
3686,good game for chilling
3687,"As from tier 5/6 its essentialy a pay to win game. 
I never thought Armored Warfare was great, but compared to this...."
3688,fun
3689,"i aint playing this game no more
pure of shit garbage 
take my word for it it's just shit pay to win stuff seriously just a piece of fuck"
3690,Armored warfare is not woking so WOTB might help you .
3691,"This still has a lot of potential BUT they NEED to update the servers and looking for games with your friends.

They need to make it where you can play with 7 of your friends going into a game.

I was trying to play with my other 2 friends but only 1 of them can join. And everytime we look for a match together, it'll take 2 or 3 minutes tops! That's NOT acceptable!

But when I play by myself, it only takes 10 or 5 seconds. How does that make sense? I don't know but this game NEEDS a update BIG TIME.

And they need to add more tanks and maps. It's okay with what they have now but I know they can get more players if they have more tanks and maps as well.

And maybe go a little further in the tanks/maps time period. They should put more WWII Tanks and Maps AND Cold War era Tanks and Maps. Even some new countries. This game can make money off of that.

But as it is, 6.7/10 for me. It can still do a lot more."
3692,Cool game about tanks...
3693,this game is the best i recommend it  because the graphics looks amazing and and the game runs smooth
3694,Match making is completely broken. You could be a rock star and teamed with a use less team and stand no chance. What's the point of playing when it's an exercise in frustration. The developer gives zero XXXX's about fixing it as they care only about receiving stream revenue where they only introduce premium tanks and crates where you get a fraction of a percentage of chance in winning something. With almost no updates to the game itself why bother. What should be a $50 game at most ends up costing players hundreds of dollars if they are dumb enough to spend it in the first place.
3695,"Played WOT before, on the PC version. it has a lot more mechanics, better quality and artillery tanks but each game takes too long to finish and i have to wait a couple minutes for my tank to back at the garage. WOTblitz is different and in my point of view, is better for a player base like me."
3696,"A lot of idiot on the public servers.
Update: much more idiots now.
update: not changed. playing for some minutes and desire to break my pc
"
3697,"It's a pretty fun game, getting to learn the play styles of different tanks can be challenging at first, but eventually you learn how to play them all, and it has a good selection of premium tanks, as well as tech tree tanks"
3698,ye fun game wot but for less powerful pc or phones i guess
3699,"this is your day, let ruin it yourself by playing World of Tank blizt
"
3700,great for passing time.
3701,"A simple yet tactical game. Rarely any other game has mastered this formula, but you all exceeded my expectations. Keep tanking!"
3702,"Literally unplayable, the game has just gotten harder and harder for free to play users, in the last years, the amount of broken premiums has increased drastically, there is almost no Tier VI to X where you will not find any broken, fake, premium tank wich will easily destroy you, if you want to play a proper tank game, play war thunder, dont install this. 

Also and the worst part of it, the loot bokes, a complete robbery, this game is played by little kids, 7 years old, 8, etc, and here they learn to gamble, it's terrible."
3703,Great rapid fire fun.
3704,"Good game 


haha tonk go brrrr"
3705,yes
3706,he is very nice gamei love diss
3707,sheesh
3708,"I have experience playing other tank games which is extremely horrible and pay to win, I though this would be the same while I was installing this game but NO! Quite balanced in-general and has frequent reward system to encourage players. If anyone is interested in tank game I highly recommend to play this game. It does not punish you for not spending money and rewards for good game play."
3709,It has quick games that you can do when you are in between other things and has a scaling system that progressively gets harder the further
3710,One of the Best Tank games to exist!
3711,WW for the win
3712,"Stay away from drugs kids. Nothing but a time-sink.

You're quite dependent on your team to win, even if you're a 70wr+ prodigy. At some point the game just stopped being fun and PB's start fitting the definition of insanity."
3713,Лучшие танчики
3714,this game is good for a free game but its ass and id never play it again
3715,Great graphics! Fun game!

3731,“Nep Nep Nep Nep Nep!!!” GARBAGE
3732,It cool i like it pog
3733,"Much better than normal wot, game just feels good and works well, only gripe is T1 heavy is kinda op atm, so fix that and it'll be an easy 9/10 in my book"
3734,A very fun game to play!
3735,"I really hate this Game cause of the toxic Gamers. But i also cant stop playing, and i cant deinstall it, i played so long Time in this Game now, i cant just throw it away. 

But for new Players: pls, dont play that Game, its Trash"
3736,"I like how much fun it is, and I also love a challenge, which is what this game can be like sometimes."
3737,"Love the game, my boys set it up for me. Great way to kill time after i do my fatherly duties and chores. highly recommened."
3738,yee
3739,"Fun game, but Rng problem"
3740,Yes Yes Yes
3741,"I mean I wouldn't EXACTLY recommend it, too bad there's no mixed option huh. It's not as P2W as the actual WoT, but it still has some elements of it. Not really that bad but come on. 

If you want a quick game of WoT without as much assfuck, then get this. If you don't like WoT, period, then don't."
3742,very historically accurate and fun
3743,NICE
3744,"this is a bullcrap game that pairs you with a bunch of fckn losers - even if you spend a dime to get upgrades you still get paired with dumbfcks.   It is worthless to waste your time and money to get better at the game as the program has zero capability of pairing you with a proper team.  I have played over 400 hours and have only decided to QUIT playing at this point.  You would think the creators would make it so the more you played and spent, the better you would get - but its just the opposite. WHAT A WASTE!"
3745,the best game
3746,"The learning curve is HUGE! Most people don't know what they're doing, even in tier 10. Because the time it takes to get to tier 10 is too short. But it's a very fun game and fun to master."
3747,if you dont mind tank controls hell yeah brotherr
3748,hippity hoppity fuck your tank i got a tiger 1
3749,"This game is just hard to like. This multi billion dollar company's game really have some of the worst server I know....packet loss for no reason, and I know its not cause my ISP cuz other fkin game is working fine, high ping outta nowhere...even when u check to the website it self its so slow, it have more than 50% loss packet when check. ffs even X NXX have better server....."
3750,Easy to play and upgrade. much fun
3751,ngl its pretty good if your on computer.
3752,it's so good this game is amaizing
3753,"if you have a stress, dont play this game, this game a lot of bad players who trolls, afks, and noobs. i already give up with this game after 1 year in laptop and 2 years in android."
3754,just need better controls
3755,"KABOOOM!!!!! graphics, tank, gameplay is so cool.."
3756,"I don't like the game. 
Graphics aren't bad but i couldnt get more than a few feet without my tank just disappearing.
you get your ass kicked by people with tanks that are 2-5x better than yours"
3757,the community can be a little bit toxic but its been a game that ive loved to play since i was 6 because of the verity in teck-trees and maps
3758,game sucks cant use ak47

I has its ups and downs with updates and releasing op tanks, but for the most part ide say its an enjoyable game and if anythings going to push you away from the game id most definitely be the player base themselves as you often get ppl even in tier X with 1-2 brain cells at most. Its a fun pass time game and you only need to play like an hour each day to do all ur missions so for being a busy college student I still always have time to play and get my crates."

3779,The games graphics and how it looks is for a mobile device it's the same on my phone your better off playing world of tanks better graphics effect ai and destruction
3780,I wouldnt reccomend this game to anyone just because of retarded MatchMaker and braindead players which have no fcking clue what to do!
3781,"is good
"
3782,i reccomend this game but well i hate that i spent rm 20 in the ingame purchase
3783,this was my childhood
3784,the server keep getting worse every years
3785,"It is very fun but you have to grind for upgrades, i have have played 300 hours on my computer and over 1000 on my phone and have only reached tier 7 tanks, there are 10 tiers."
3786,"If you want a free, fun, fast paced game, look no further. Packed with events, tanks, offers, players, and action, this game will have you immersed for years. There are plenty of amazing historical tanks, and if you want something more interesting, there are also tanks based off of Mad Max, Star Wars, Valkyria Chronicles, Girls und Panzers, etc. The physics very arcady, and you can customize every tank through camouflages, multiple shell types, consumables, equipment, and some others. And with over 100M players, you'll have no trouble finding matches."
3787,"always lag, everytime i play this game got loss 20%"
3788,very fun if you get the better team
3789,It is a fun game!
3790,"great game, and mechanics. been playing this game on different platforms for many years, and I love it. it really makes me think about positioning and tactics, which has helped me progress in other games as well."

3793,"NOT WORTH PLAYING THIS GAME, RECOMMENDED DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME I REPEAT DO NOT INSTALL THIS PIECE CRAP OF GAME OR YOU'LL REGRET LATER. EVEN IN GOOGLE PLAY I GIVE 1 STAR RATING. WG DEVELOPER ONLY EYEING FOR MONEY GRABBER RATHER BRING IMPROVEMENT. DEVELOPER OF THIS GAME ARE BIG TIME SCAMMER"
3794,"This game is ruining me and is making me make poor choices with my money,I would not recommend playing"
3795,i have 66 hours of play time! not that much but still this game has lovely graphics and works well on low end pc and laptops. i 100% recommend giving this game ago if you have played wargamings other projects.
3796,Stop putting me in groups with players who all go center or hide out in the open.
3797,"Love this...
Highly Recommend"
3798,Great time waster

3815,"Worst game I've ever played. Pay To Win in every way, matchmaking horible,THE BRAND NEW boss mode is even worst than realistic mode, Grinding taking to long bc of bad teamates/afkers. Premiums are OP and I am not even gonna mention Blitz Nation tanks. Instead of doing what players want they do something to make players pay. Bounces on tank with no armor that are standing still, Track crits, fast-loader tanks, and the my BELOVED part, aiming and shooting, Grille with aim boost and it still goes to the stratosphere if it is not a GHOST SHELL ofc."
3816,"Fuck this shit, devs only care for microtranscation but neglecting the server stability, bad MM, & RNGesus controlling most game mechanics is literally garbages."
3817,its ok now
3818,"It's a fun game, but a lot of the time it's very pay to win. If you get the right tank, you pretty much instantly die because this one guy steamrolls everyone. That doesn't happen super often, it's only every few matches, so it's still fun, though."
3819,"lots of toxic players, pay to grind... well, this is really a good game, but due to lots of nerfs this game is not recommended. Unless you are a masochist like me ;)"
3820,"After a year of  playing. This game is frustrating. Buttttt, it is because it is a challenges. Get 1000 battles in, first 200 is against bots(that how they teach you) Its not COD type game, every tank has its own weakness and strength, 1 match 1 death. 

Try it it for 1000 battles it is fun"
3821,"Avoid this Russian cancer they call a game.

Mobile gaming cancer.  Overwhelming amount of micro transactions.  Bots flood the game and is basically like playing with hackers. Pay to win tanks run wild.  Garbage RNG game play.. like seriously, the tank tracks stop a tank round.  Your shots will just go flying wildly in a random direction with any movement regardless of your aiming circle.  And concealment is super broken.  Constantly getting shot by people you can't see.  LITERALLY, they will not render in at all.

It's cancer and the company should be blacklisted from steam."
3822,Its Fun. Quite addictive. Servers always have people playing
3823,pew pew

please help"
3831,best of the best
3832,look the game is a good time killer it has some flaws like sometimes there is a long wait time to get into matches but overall its is a fun easy to play game that can take multiple hours to master you can pay to get higher tier tank but they are not the best you actually have to grind to get the best
3833,lol

3841,50 to 50
3842,yes cool very nice gam
3843,"funi game
"
3844,"Pros: 
Faster paced than its competitors, World of Tanks and War Thunder, smaller teams allows you to have a bigger impact.  

Cons: 
Wargaming only cares about tank balance at tier 9 and 10, tiers below that they're mostly trying to sell premium tanks.  

Because this game is available to mobile players, there is usually a very large disparity between player skill and competitiveness.  This can sometimes be frustrating."
3845,lit game about tanks
3846,play it why not
3847,decent game can get repetitive tho idk.
3848,"You can play this game only in  60 fps, doesnt matter if it is a pc version, not worth it"
3849,REALLY FUN BUT I'M DEAF FROM ALL THE GUNSHOTS
3850,eee
3851,A superior game to the normal World of tanks
3852,"this game ate half of my soul during this xmas event 
I would like a refund of my soul"
3853,very good game and fun
3854,"After so much hours played i can tell you don*t play this game. the MatchMaker is rigged.... i lost so much games because of a stupid team i cant even count. And i won so much games, because i carried...but its 7 vs 7, not 1 (+6 bots) vs 7 !"
3855,"The review of ban on this game for a player is not fair. A player reported me for blocking however I was blocked first. Do not recommend the society/developers review of my ban was correct. Even though its a day ban Its still evil that I can get blocked 1st then try to get back my position to no avail, and inevitably caused another players destruction in a game. TO THE DEVELOPERS/REVIEWERS THE FACTS WERE NOT ALL CHECKED BEFORE MY DAY BAN. I WONT BE PLAYING THIS GAME OFTEN NO MORE OR MAKE ANY FURTHER TRANSACTIONS DUE TO THE UNFAIR WAY I WAS TREATED. I FEEL Ostracised AND DONT TRUST THE PLAYERS AND DEVELOPERS OF THIS GAME. i AM MOVING ON TO PLAY WAR THUNDER AND WOT BLITZ WILL NEVER AND I MEAN NEVER SUPPORT THIS GAME AGAIN.  ALL IN ALL THE GAMEPLAY MECHANICS SUCKS DOWNRIGHT AND APPALLING CONTENT  NATURE OF PLAYERS whom are ALL LBGT AFFILIATED"
3856,"ive been playing the game for around 4 years (mobile im new to steam version) sorry if im a bit bias. the game is amazing , but its not all realistic ( if you want realistic try war thunder but war thunder has planes and boats so if you dont want to be constantly bombed play world of tanks. war thunder [to me] is consideribly harder though) but again amazing game war gaming its fun and wierd in a good way"
3857,"very bad matchmaking suggest not playing it it gives you cancer
"
3858,"It good
"
3859,tank go boom
3860,"I have been playing this game for about 3 or so years. The game has been out for at least twice that.  The game used to be fun but I am not sure if it's a combination of the game dying or if WG's simply doesn't care about addressing it's glaring problems. The game itself is 7v7 and if you're good one person can definitely sway the outcome of the battle. That's how I was able to maintain close to a 60%WR for a few thousand battles.  What I have found in the last year or so is a growing problem with connectivity and LAG. You have players bouncing many tank-lengths ahead and behind making it impossible to hit a target.  Their servers suck. A big second problem, and I've notice this over the last 6 months or so, that almost every game has 1 afk. So if the teams only have 7 players and you are routinely 1 tank down that can and often does cost you the game.  I am assuming people wrote basic bot programs to have their tanks run continuously in play to earn credits at the expense of the 6 other players. Or it could just be bad connections but I think the former is more likely.  Imagine playing 10 games in a row and literally every game has at least 1 afk.  It makes the game unplayable. The last thing is a player base which is truly awful to play with. And again I am not sure if I am playing with actual people or bots because I suspect the community is dying. But imagine being on a team where everyone except yourself is camping near spawn all bunched together or 1 guy yolos out to his death and gets killed in 5 seconds. All in all, the game has become unplayable. Don't bother with it."
3861,My grandpa's favorite game. Testicular cancer took him away. I just want to say thanks to Wargaming for giving him his last best days in his life
3862,"Absolute scam, they will do their best to take your money. Even with the latest update instead of being able to simply open the crates like in the past, you have to view and scroll down a whole page filled with premium tanks, gold offers and much more useless stuff. Then you have crates... spend 4 euros for one crate where you have less than 1% chance to get the tank you want. 

Please just don't play this ""game"". There's more gambling than a casino with trash balance and economy and toxic community"
3863,"Game is really fun and very detailed. the community is great as well and there are constant updates, some minor, and some bigger. Each and every tank is very detailed and very differnet than the other. There is a reason to play a specific tank in order to be able to progress or even to upgrade the same one making it more effective in battle. I personally play the game purely to collect iconic WW2 tanks in the game, but even the not 100% realistic tanks can be very exiting to play. Playing for some time with one tank and then unlocking another one can be a great feeling of success. I definetely reccomend this game to experienced PC gamers and mostly patient people since collecting for some certain things can be quite a painful grind."
3864,Fun and fast combat
3865,yesssssssssssssssssssss
3866,"If it wasn't for the constant change to the tanks and gameplay performed by WarGaming, this game would be a bit better. As it is, if you don't want to pay for premium, and happen to hit streaks of bad luck, (can't stop loosing) this game is impossible  to progress in. Used to be better."
3867,"Played it, its fun"
3868,"A  bit simpler to play than WoT, a good place for a novice to start"
3869,The game is very good! But is some p2w

good alternative to world of tanks for pc, much easier to play and master. 
often updates very nice.
no artillery. 
the only negative i can think of is the constant loot boxes and some op tanks.
over all really good and fun to play"
3878,good game
3879,"as long as you do not pay , the difficulty gets higher
"
3880,meh
3881,"The game can be fun, but it has some incredibly frustrating drawbacks.  The biggest drawback is that you enemies can be invisible.  Not behind cover.  not behind a a tree or some shrubs, but actually INVISIBLE.  You cant see them, but they can see, shoot, and kill you.  that is a major flaw in a reality and physics-based game. i wont pay for this game until they get rid of invisible tanks."
3882,fuck steam for recommending this when i was clearly searching for the original game!
3883,it cool
3884,"Fricking epic
"
3885,VERI GUD
3886,"Don't ever play this game !

This game is very charge-inducing and matchmaking is also sloppy.
Recently, the level has gotten worse, so the team with the most expensive users is very likely to win.

The tank  bought in cash is never NURF !

The average winning rate between our team and the other team doesn't match !

I'm a user who played nearly 8,000 games. 
I've been playing this game for a long time and loved it, but I think it's time to let go. Please create a better gaming environment if a wargaming official sees this article."
3887,like
3888,Great game and very awesome!!!!
3889,"This is he best game ever.
It treats hypotension as far as I know."
3890,Since when could tanks fly? and why are they shooting chain lightning at each other?
3891,Buff Fv215B 183 :3
3892,"very good, but really wants you to pay for things"
3893,YES! my dreams is come true this game it so coool... I can shoot i can move and i can get a new tanks i like it 10/10
3894,"World of Tanks Blitz is a Tank action based game in a 7 vs 7 match, with over hundreds of tanks to choose and play. Start from tier 1 tank, to the tier 10 tank, from Small tank to a Artillery. some of the tanks can only be acquired by using the 'premium' currency. The game's match are quite fast,  and the graphics are not too bad, I play this game for 20 Hours, and got bored too quickly, If you want to play this game, You require a friends of yours to play. I highly recommend this game to a player that likes tanks and action."
3895,игра хорошая лучше большого собрата но много упорантов и токсиков которые не дают нормально играть
3896,"basically all i can say is that i love the game, who else?"
3897,it ok
3898,"Blitz is an improvement over WOT in that there are only 2 tiers per battle, smaller teams, no artillery, and easier progress."
3899,Great team work Game!
3900,its good nice game but needs a little work on the gun sounds just like the PC sounds
3901,i hated it so thats why i played 360 hrs of my life for that reason

3914,YO THIS GAME IS FUUUUUUUUUN

3916,A very awesome game and can't recommend enough.
3917,Fun game and can run on anything. Great game to spend your time as there is always something to do.
3918,Seems really easy to collect rewards and credits.
3919,It's a glorified mobile game where you play against bots that never miss you. You either die being the last one or you win with a full team alive. The balance is sewer bottom scraps. Let's also point out that your full head on shots will bounce. XP gain will be quick on the first levels to get you playing but don't count on it to give you anything good.
3920,Play this gam

3927,"This game gets a lot of hate for being a mobile port and not the full WoT experience but having played both I can tell you this is just a different game. There's no artillery, the maps are small, and matches go very quickly because of it.

You still get your WoT mechanics with penetrations, armor thicker in front, angle of attack deflections, module damages, ammo rack explosions, and crew damage based on hit locations but in a slim fast paced fun design. And never more or less than 7 people per team.

All in all it's a really fun game for what it is."
3928,Yes
3929,addicted
3930,"Cool game, can be  a lot of fun but frustrating too."
3931,nice game :)
3932,"Nice game, fast game, exiting & fun"
3933,very good but if you have bad team you lose
3934,good
3935,the best game
3936,shit game
3937,"ok, I'm Very good"
3938,This is a fun game.
3939,It's the mobile game version of a game that already isn't very good.
3940,great game older people like me can join the fun.
3941,tanks goe brrr
3942,gay
3943,Honestly A shit game now that they have ported the real version over go play that. this is a horrible version meant for mobile. very trashy and the normal world of tanks isnt p2w like this game.
3944,great game
3945,its just a good game
3946,i mean for a 3gb game its great graphics and content wise gameplay is amazing but yes there is a but make it easier to get in game money  (not encluding gold)
3947,"This review is about the state of this game in August, 2021.

I first played when this game launched on mobile 7 years ago, and had about 1000 battles, and then swapped to the main PC game. I have since played almost 40,000 battles with 57% WR on the PC game, but the trash map design, SPG's combined with the EBR's drove me back to Blitz. 

So this review is from the perspective of a well above-average WoT PC player.

Blitz is overall a much more enjoyable experience than the main game. 


Pros:
+NO ARTY

+Smaller maps = faster games (~3 mins average match times)

+Instant switching of shell types rewards those with good knowledge of armor profiles when driving tanks with big guns.

+Runs well on any PC if you lower settings.

+Can cross-play with mobile players = instant advantage for PC players. Disable the ""only play with same control scheme"" settings for free advantage.

+Lots of free items and even premium tanks every month or two. You only need to play about an hour a day to claim everything in these events. F2P players can get by easily without economy issues until about tier 8.


+/- Effective armor is displayed in sniper mode:
    no shading 100% to penetrate -> yellow = possible penetration -> red = impossible
     which makes the game easier to learn but also lowers skill ceiling, since you don't have to actually remember armor values and weak spots.

+/- Some changes to armor profiles are absolutely idiotic. For example: Tiger I (165 mm frontal base) and Tiger II (240 mm frontal effective upper + lower plates) armor values are way over-buffed and are easily the strongest tech tree heavy tanks for their tiers. Wehraboos rejoice!


Cons:
-Some premium tanks are overpowered, but are not much of an issue unless they are in a platoon. Think 2x Annihilators.

-British Light Tanks. I hate them. Basically are Medium Tanks of the same tier but have HESH at tiers 9 + 10, and are matched against Light Tanks. Extremely unpleasant to play against a competent Vickers CR/LT player. The tier 10 also has the highest view range in the game. I have them both and I believe them should be nerfed. Worse than EBRs. Made to sh*t on other light tanks.

-Crew skills are unbalanced as they offer some bonuses that are game changing, but can only be obtained after hundreds of battles to get them to a decent level. Most broken is definitely camo, where it is a massive advantage for someone with camo at rank 7 vs someone without it. Most of my Tank Destroyers have 60%+ stationary camo, and I regularly out spot Light Tanks.

-Netcode is meh. What shocks me is that in 7 years you still can't hold down the fire command while loading to fire immediately when ready. You instead have to send the fire command after the shell is ready. This makes auto-(re)loading tanks have a higher effective clip dump time, since you have to add your ping + reaction time to the intra-clip time. Would not recommend clip-based tanks if you have 200+ ping as you will be a severe disadvantage in DPM to single shot tanks.

-Graphics are not good even on highest settings. However this is a trade-off for performance.



Overall game is very enjoyable and new-player friendly compared to the main PC game. 
8.5/10

**Would strongly recommended against buying high tier premium tanks right away because you will lose often when you are new, and you will end up being salty and come back here to leave a bad review. Learn first, then buy. Don't buy premium tanks without some research beforehand as some are pure garbage and not worth the money at all. Check YouTube or r/WorldOfTanksBlitz for what's not trash. Generally avoid Premium (Gold) and Collector (Blue) tanks below tier 5 as they make minimal credits and are stale to play."

3954,The go to game for tanking
3955,"I'd recommend this for the simple reason that World of Tanks Blitz is far less of a mess than the PC version of this game. Powercreep, P2W elements and the other negative attributes one thinks of when WoT PC is mentioned are far less apparent in the mobile version. The game in general also is far less of a maze with regards to the interface.

However, this game still is made by WarGaming. Lootboxes galore, shitty rewards for completing missions and the grind is pretty awful if you don't have premiums and a premium account. 

The lootboxes are especially awful. This is still a mobile game at heart, so the game tries its hardest to push special offers, premium bundles and lootboxes right down your throat. There's notifications for every shitty offer and the interface is designed for everything that costs money to stand out from the rest.
There's also this awful thing the game does, where you get lootboxes as some sort of battle reward. Seems good, until you try to open said box and see you have to pay for keys to open the box. That's honestly criminal and they should simply not hand these out. Same thing counts for the god-awful temporary profile icons. No WG, I do not want a notification for your poorly designed temporaries, of which you can get up to ten a day.

This game still is far from perfect, but it's in less of a garbage position than the PC version - for now. Things WILL get worse."
3956,From a stand point of starting out. WoTB is far better than WoT.
3957,when u know about characteristics about each and every tank then u will not leave playing this game
3958,Trust me... you'll spend money

3970,"awesome game! i love playing this game for a couple hours a day, the randomness of the shots i dont like so much and losing money every match if you're anything short of an expert with the higher tier tanks... stopped playing right after Yao tanks got added, might pick it back up in a month or so"
3971,"(Sorry for bad english)
Hello!
So, WoT blitz... basically a flash version of World of Tanks. Usually, it is a very fun game, but it has some of it's lags, and very INTERESTING game mechanics, if you ever played the regular WoT, then you should definitely try this game out! If you never tried WoT, then please try that first, since they are very similar. 
The game also has a lot of tanks to purchase! All the tanks are upgradeable except the Premium Veichles, but don't be upset, since the premium tanks are free to repair, and you will getway more credits and free xp than the normal tanks. And it is free to play 😉"
3972,"for a F2P game with instant action, great progression and genuine pvp feeling download it now"
3973,"YEEEEEEEEEEEE
"
3974,"This game is so funny I highly recommend it. Its a very grindy strategy game if you love tanks, destruction and teamwork you NEED to play this game."

3984,bit boring to be honest
3985,:)
3986,Geat for a short game and no need to spend a pile of money to make it fun. There are a few cheaters out there but I have not found it a problem. Let them win a hollow victory if their lives are that empty.
3987,Game is amazing!
3988,THIS GAME IS GOOD!!!
3989,it lagging a loot
3990,"My Brother played this game on my account. He's addicted to it, so you can measure the worth from that I guess."
3991,"[b]WoT VS WoTB:[/b] I have played both WoT and WoTB and I must say that I actually kind of enjoy WoTB more. The smaller groups, in comparison to WoT, make your contribution to a match a lot more impactful and the game feels a lot more ""tanky"" than in the original WoT. The matches are very short. Around 3-6 minutes, which I actually like A LOT, because this allows you to play a lot of matches and make process fast even if you don't have that much free time to play. 

In general, the game is a lot easier than the original WoT. It's more casual. If you're more of a competitive player, you will probably enjoy the original WoT more.

[b]Graphics:[/b] Of course the graphics aren't that astonishing to look at, it's a mobile game after all, but they aren't really that bad either tbh. The really good thing about it is though: This game really runs on anything. I have both a gaming PC and a normal laptop and it even runs on my laptop. And my laptop really isn't built to run games. This means you can play this with all your friends, even if they only have some potato laptop or a phone. It's crossplay too!

[b]Balance:[/b] The game is mostly balanced, but there are a few tanks (mostly in Tier 7) who are ridiculously strong. (Smasher, Annihilator...) Even so, it doesn't break the game too much. The lower tiers are the most balanced.

[b]In-Game purchases:[/b] The prices for premium tanks are mostly okayish. But before you buy any tank, you should look at forums if they are really worth it. It's also best to buy tanks during big events. I would recommend to never buy any crates, as these are literally just gambling and the chances to get something good out of it are really slim. 

The battle pass (around 5 euros) is probably the best deal. You get 2 tanks (tier 4 & 6) and a lot of other good goodies (gold, silver, camos) out of it. However, it will also force you to play the game at least 4 times a week for at least 1-2 hours a day to actually unlock these things."
3992,Hmmmm...... This game is Good You can say its veryyyyyyyyy veryyy good! And its free this is the best thing at the game!
3993,addictive and very fun.
3994,♥
3995,I like this game in general !

4013,The best battle game I ever play about Tank in World War II! Just very awesome!
4014,"Honestly I dont write many reviews but jeez I had to say something - Its pretty fun but after about 35 minutes you realize you're just playing with hyperaggressive bots because the game insists on sticking you in a massive tutorial to micromanage your movements and make you play longer. It's stupid as hell honestly It's like ""Do this click here, fight bots you won! Cool, click this go here, fight bots"" and nah fuck that I'm just gonna play real world of tanks, they should have never given their IP to any overseas app developer cause they fucked it."

4045,"During this week's event in game, you could get a special edition tank if you collected 400 items. I was short a few, so I purchased gold to get enough items to get the tank. Once I had the 400 ""rotors"" I needed, I tried to buy the tank with the 400 rotor price tag, but it said I needed 130 rotors more. Even though the tank clearly says it costs 400 rotors and I had 407 rotors available. I contacted support and they said that I additionally had to collect other items (not mentioned anywhere) to get the tank. This is clearly a bait and switch. I then asked for a refund for the gold I spent on paying for the missing items. They denied it. So f them and f this game."

4090,Im a Tanker And This Game IS Pretty Fun
4091,"Would I recommend this game? Yes. It's free, so that's a bonus to start with. Tanks can be bought from gaining money in-game or with real cash. This doesn't give you any more of an advantage though. It's still down to skill and working well with the seven other players in your team. Teams consist of mobile and PC players. Game modes are Capture the flag and team deathmatch games. Upgrade tank parts to better parts with experience from battles. 

My review score. 9/10."

4103,POOR balancing. Most of the time one team has most of the best players so the other teams gets creamed.
4104,"Before i start this review, I am a ""Pro"" player with 73% wr (Win ratio) with over 10k+ battles(800+ hours easy). I have played wotb since 2015. Done tourneys, events, pretty much everything this game can offer. The graphics are great for a mobile game (10/10), mechanics are also very good (9/10). The player base is also fairy active, even after such a long time, so that's nice as well. I quit a while back but decided to explain why. Firstly, they started bringing in actual overpowered *premium* tanks. Though they may not admit it, any player with a brain can tell these tanks are simply op (annihilator, type 62, smasher, t22 med etc.). I have used almost EVERY tank in the game, and some tanks are just simply on a whole different level from others (I've got like 63 Masteries in type 62). NOW the MAIN reason I quit was the TERRIBLE matchmaking. Anyone who strives for good stats, or even just enjoys competition in general will be driven away by this. You will get on teams with pure 40%ers, while their team will be ALL 55%+. Its actually insane, and it happens so often, their team will completely wipe you, and you'll be at a loss for words watching your last teammate drive into a wall shooting at some birds in the air or something. Its the same in ranking matches, so don't think its any different. They should also include a tier 8 ""Advanced Optional tutorial"", which describes advanced mechanics such as face hugging, frontal and reverse side scraping, angling etc. It would be VERY helpful. This game can reach its full potential if you have discord, so if u get the game and enjoy it, get discord and find a wotb server. The tech tree is nice, and i learned a tons about tanks and history by playing this game, but i think EVERY tank from tier 8-10 should have less exp in order to research it. Id say at LEAST 70% of the player base never gets to tier X because it takes too long. They should also add 1 week, 1 month, 3 month, 1 year stats sections into the game so people can see their progress/time, instead of having to rely on an external website like blitzstars. Overall great game, but ruined (for me) because of bad matchmaking and ""slight"" unbalancing."
4105,like the game a lot go fun.
4106,Needs skill based matchmaking and absolutely annoying to get a team that cant think their way out of an open box and get a face a team that has perfect  ability to have 3 + tanks snipe from cover without revealing themselves
4107,Nice
4108,"its an amazing game

4110,"The game seems like a decent waste of time.  The issues are that it is stuffed with micro transactions that I can assume will mean play hits a wall as progression slows and slows without money.  There are also premium vehicles, which will give the wallet warriors another advantage.

Just another in a long line of games built on the premise of a credit card arms race.

What's worse, is three out of my first twenty or so matches, I had a team mate just sitting still at spawn.  All the way to them being the last one killed.  These are only the ones I noticed, because I had already died, first.  I'm sure it's great IF it happens to the enemy team.  These guys need some sort of punishment if anybody's going to play the game.  A stern warning the first time, a ten minute kick the second time, a day kick the third?  Of course sometimes nature calls or your kid does themself an injury, but if you're simply not playing when you sign in, your team suffers because you're joining games you shouldn't be.

Again, game is a decent waste of time.  I'll likely put ten hours on over the weekend, burn out on it, and delete it in a month.


-- Edit 8/1
Another hour played this morning, I've still been the MVP or #2 in every match I've played.  The 7v7 map seems like it just increases the chances of having a guy on your team that does less than 200 damage.  My last match I just got overrun while the rest of my team lolligagged.  It's easy to lose when it's 3v1.  They really need a way to put in a complaint about a player.  The thumbs up is cool and all, but I'd rather people that ram friends into the open, etc, are sheered off my teams.

The constant pop-ups telling you to buy crap has already gotten old.  The event is worthless unless you're willing to pay money to buy the new tanks.  Like I said in the original review, the game is just another wallet warrior wet dream.  It's fun, don't get me wrong.  It's also frustrating.  Not because it's hard; it's a very fun, simple game.  However, because it's a multiplayer, you can't do any better than the rest of your team.  You can kill two or even three tanks, just to find the rest of your team all got killed and now it's a 4v1 the hard way.  

Sure, I had matches where I killed two, my six team mates killed one before all dying, I had a 4v1, was able to pick off one injured tank before getting surrounded.  You can only run so far on a square map.  Unless the enemies make dumb mistakes, you're not getting out alive.  There's only so much ""Okay, go around this building, put space between myself and this guy's two friends so I can fight him on a level playing field,"" you can do.  You hide in cover for a second while loading, and that's a second closer the rest of the enemies are to you.

Yes, I've been on good teams.  I've had teams that did great and we won losing only one tank, or won with no losses.  I've seen the 5v1 the easy way endings.  You win some, you lose some.  It's all based on your team and if anybody's swiping a credit card.  I see burnout on this title coming in hot."

4113,"Massive multi player. Massive fun. You can play solo just as well as with a friend. Defo thumbs up.
"
4114,"Shoot tank, tank go boom. Overall, decent game. Although not perfect, its pretty fun. The amount of free stuff you get is nice, this includes premium time which comes in hour certificates. Didn't mind spending small amounts of money if good promotions came out as it seemed worth it. Would recommend to kill time."
4115,"I have had a WG account for 10 years (B-tester WoT, A-tester WoWs) and I do not want to start the game and from the beginning with a ""new"" account, because this is how WG and STEAM came up with the new account to increase the statistics of the number of ""new"" players , marketing idiot"
4116,I like this game !
4117,good game but after you get to tier 7 it gets really hard to unlock better tanks
4118,"I've been teaming up with noobs even if they own a tier 5 tank but the shooting skill like crap... maybe developer should add some features like ranked mode and teaming up player according their rank so that would balance the team up issue...

4129,"If you like to rage and get your mind fucked , then this is the game . Full of nubs with no idea what to do. Devs don't give a fuck about what you think , they trust their automated data more then the real player experience. Absolute money sucking Bats , giving out high tier premium tanks to newbies and they ruin the game experience , Heavys camping at the back of map. Players with 40k battles have 40 WR , so many battles still didnt learn anything from the game. Wargaming has already fcuked up in WOW and now they will do the same in WOTB."

realy if you want a good free game try this!"
4137,"The whole problem is team balance.Y get  2-3  fair games  and after that y doomed.40% bots against 70% players in enemy team its a pure nightmare.Its makes game completly unplayble and unenjoyable.Whole team get farmed in miliseconds.Plus tons of shiity imba tanks like Crusher,Destroyer etc.Absoletly degenerate events(wommit prises aka another uselss tank) which generate a ton of bots and 30% players."
4138,"Crappier version of World of Tanks PC, I mean why tf you wanna play on PC when you can play on phone? (unless you're using a Nokia 3310) Plus this game after version 5.5 where they tune all the vehicle hitpoints and damage entirely, making the tanks like bullet sponges which distance the similarities to PC version and made it extremely arcade and unexciting. Yeah yeah to make newcomers easily get used to the game, but come on, where is this game's motto? Get gud? More like adoption newbies.

Add on: this game is way terrible and garbage optimization for old pcs that can run WOT pc version better than blitz, like bruh wat."
4139,ggggggreat
4140,"Could be fun but the matchmaking as always screws you with all these hidden rules. The game literally saddles you with low win rate players if your win rate is above 50% , leading to extreme losing streams.

No concept of fairness or equality, more like punishment. War thunder vastly better."

4151,"Reached Tier X on multiple nations on mobile but I figured the Steam version isn't any different:

Do not play if you: a) have a gambling addiction. b) don't like grinding. or c) get offended easily. There are lots of gambling, grinding, and toxic players in the game. If you can get over that, the game itself is fine, 8/10."
4152,good！
4153,GG
4154,"It's great to be able to play and use the item's I've earned on the mobile edition and continue on PC! I've played a good bit of WOW's on my iPhone SE (old) and was very happy to be able to continue the progress on my PC. Although I feel that the World of Tanks standard is better, if you made progress or bought items on Blitz it's a good idea to continue on here."
4155,"maybe it's just my toaster of a computer but my game never loads, every minute i have on this game is me waiting for the game to start running.
"
4156,"Make you feel depressed, recommended"
4157,"Until you reach 500 battles, you mainly fight AI, though you still see some players. Once you get past 500, you dont get bots anymore...at least not robot ones. 90% of the people in this game are complete trash and I like a challenge, but people in this game simply don't deliver. If you want an experience where any side could win and everyone does their part, this is not the game for you.

Now, if you don't mind brain dead people, this is a really great way to pass time and have fun. The grinding isn't too much, you get loads of free premium account, great deals in the shop if you want to buy something. Being a more arcade-style game, the realism isn't too daunting and is more relaxed. The graphics aren't the best, but that's because this game is also for mobile people. There is the non-Blitz World of Tanks for PC with better graphics, though that game is another mess and I don't recommend trying it at all."
4158,
4159,"This game has the best mobile Tank gaming experience, but the devs are terribly lackluster. In this 7v7 strategy/skill game balancing is very important. The balance was great and the game was fun only up until 3 years ago. After 2018, (i forget the exact update) more and more features were added to WoTB. The problem here is that the features aren't good features.  These features enraged a number of the playerbase as well as content creators. As for myself, crates, battlepass, guided missiles, you-name-it, all completely ignore the skill required to play the game. Crates weren't a thing, you had to earn your money and gold. The battlepass is totally meaningless to players who don't want to spend money. Oh have I talked about money yet? This game is HEAVILY pay-to-win. A large majority of the game's OP Premium Tanks cost more than $50. The problem here is that no matter how much the price goes up for these premium tanks, people will buy them. So much so that you'll see at least 1 of these OP premium tanks in each and every game you play. I don't need to specify what tanks, just imagine a tank with impenetrable armor and massive loads of damage that no tank can compare to. 
The meta seems to be spending money rather than refining skill and strategy. The devs have simply thrown the game to shit by giving the playerbase OP tanks. Players no longer think about strategy, they no longer play with teamates. What's the point of having a team if your team will just get wiped with a single OP tank? There was a time where it used to be 1v7 and 50% of the time the 1 player would win. 50%!!! That's crazy high numbers for a 1v7!... 
I haven't played the game for a while and will no longer play the game again. I've somehow managed to remain at 65.37% winrate, but it's no longer possible to maintain the positive attitude I always had towards this game."
4160,Dont. Play. This. Game.
4161,pay 2 win type of game. since i paid for a few tanks here and there... I can tell there's a huge difference beetwen premium and normal tanks.
4162,This game sucks
4163,游戏还行，在遇到克估和鼠标队友时可以治疗低血压，剩下都挺好
4164,"This game is great. Theres alot of tanks with different type of gameplay. Dont buy the AT 8, that thing made my ancestors cry.My personal favourite line to grind was the German tank destroyers primarily the Grille 15 line. There are light tanks, medium tanks, heavies and tank destroyers.Suits for camping play style or even rushing play styles. So theres something for everyone. The players are sometimes toxic.Some are great people but if u got called a nub by the toxic ones, just call their mom a nub at making childrens or something like that will scare them."
4165,maybe
4166,LOTS OF FUN
4167,Bad game but can be fun
4168,"The game overall mechanically isn't bad. Tank selection was good for a while until Wargamming wanted to add a fantasy tanks to the game. The tournaments are okay if you can find people to join. Pretty exclusive hierarchy of clans with snobby attitudes. The community is an absolute nightmare. Don't expect to play this without some sort of comment of negativity from someone. The ""Military Honor"" system is a joke. You can get bad reviews from someone without cause; if they want to give it they will regardless."
4169,fun
4170,"I have played the original world of tanks on PS4, the ol' Xbox 360 and blitz on other devices. World of tanks in my mind, is the game you want to go for if you're just looking for a quick game, or just don't have the time to sit down and spend as much time as you need in the original WOT. either way it's still a lot of fun. Highly recommend. There is a tank for everyone even in blitz. Roll out!"
4171,"Broken Premiums.

Balancing issues."
4172,"it is built diffent
"
4173,"It is a good game where you choose your tank (you can get stronger tanks by playing before with the first tanks, which are weaker), from many nations and even tanks from others nation with the same account.
Problem is that when you play you get to choose only one tank per match, and when you die, you need to play another match.
I would really like a mode where you can use more than 1 tank and play until you destroy all of your tanks."
4174,"A nice/simple/entertaining game... don't expect too much apart from this. It's fun and free, just how you like it."
4175,"P2W tanks

4177,Bro fix the ghost shell pls
4178,"Fun, but could do with more in the way of instruction re' other than basic features.  I still do not know how to access different types of ammo, fire extinguisher etc successfully, and when i tried buying fancy ammo i got huge amounts of points deducted every time I used it, so stopped using it."
4179,"You should try it , This game is pretty fun"
4180,"Loving this Game, addictive !!"
4181,"Less difficult than WoT. If you just want to relax it's cool, but let go of the gameplay challenges."
4182,"Ahhhhh yes, played this game for 3 years and spent over 100$ on it and it ain't the same as it's used to be
before I rant, look away and give War Thunder a look
if your PC is as good as a Soviet Potato farm then sit by the campfire, cuz this old dog has an honest review to tell
I can still run it on a potatop but barely smooth wiith graphics set to a minimum
P2W piece of dung but at least they are buffing the tech tree tanks if you even bother grinding the lines
DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE LOOT BOXES, it's a free to play game
of course they'll be trying to milk more money from us
you can grind from tier I to tier X on one single line for a total of 3 to 5 weeks tops if you know what you're doing
it's still very painful though since tier VII and above is pretty much a OP premium tank cesspit
pre 5.5 update you can see lots of variety of tanks tier VI and below, shame they removed them for the newbies
trying to get used to the game, it's a shame because they were so much fun
They used to give out tanks for free in events if you grind hard enough or a sufficient amount of times for them
now you have to pay a battlepass for tier VI reskins, the battlepass is somewhat worth it
if you even bother grinding it after getting the battlepass tanks
dev to player response is still scarce, probably too busy drowning in $$$
battles are simple enough, 7v7 on a very symmetrical map
you have 2 objectives for ""Random Battles"", capture the base or destroy all enemy vehicles
then there is ""Supremacy"" which is part of the roster of ""Random Battles""
2 objectives: Earn enough points by capping bases or destroying enemy vehicles until it reaches 1000 
or destroy all enemy vehicles before their meter reaches 1000
then we have other fun game modes like Gravity Mode, Mad Games, Uprising, Burning Games, Realistic Battles and Skirmish 
all of them were fun to be honest
shame I missed the 100th tank anniversary and the Duck modes
player base has a decent size and you can see the occasional toxicity and trolling which is funny to look at battle chat if it's not directed to you
it's still bad tho and based off of experience that it ain't pretty
Game economy ain't what it used to
you used to earn piles of credits but now you have to mind how much spend
can't use Premium Ammo too often cuz they are expensive as heck, you either pay lots of credits or some gold
they are only situational at best
mind your booster usage and performance in battle
if you win, you get a good amount of credits most of the time, if you lose, you won't get a good amount of credits most of the time
Experience system is broken and slow
Booster will be your saving grace if you have lots stock piled

honestly, if you're patient, used to grinding and just have a passion for tanks and armored vehicles
this might be the game for you
but I still wouldn't recommend it though ;)"
4183,"world of tanks blitz is a good game you can up grade your tanks quickly and its easy to get credits. It is a friendly game but you might find some toxic people and there are some really friendly people 
"
4184,solid game played it for 4 years now. just put in some time and grind a little bit to get some good upgraded tanks. the Emil line is pretty good same for the obj. 140 and t62a line.
4185,"good and fun game, teams arent the best however and can be easily triggered"
4186,"fun and fast pace, not an immersive simulator but lots of fun and interactions"
4187,this game is so great there is a reason so many people recommend this game play it you will enjoy it trust me
4188,"It's a fun game, and amazingly keeps you enjoying the game for the perfect amount of time, whilst not making you helplessly addicted! It's a very fun game, and quite exciting too!"
4189,This game is so good!! But please to fix the matchmaking!
4190,good
4191,its fun
4192,make moe tech tree tanks
4193,"wargaming.net are a bunch of crooks they only help those that will send them money to their personnel accounts and they take your tanks or say you destroyed 1 tank when in fact the replay clearly shows 3 tanks being destroyed by you. the screw you  over in tournaments if you show up and no one else does you get screwed out of your military honors. this company has no honor of it's own. I hope everyone leaves this company and that will force them to start treating all of us they right way instead of them cheating and stealing from us

4209,gud game for chill with friends :)
4210,You can shoot kids on their parents ipod
4211,would be cool if there was team voice chat cuz typing takes ages especially when your trying to control a tank. but other than that unreal game love all the detail put into maps. fun game to play for sure.
4212,is nice
4213,Better than WoT PC
4214,"I started as a FTP WOT PC player, if you wanna dive into WOT PC, Blitz is a wonderful platform for you to grasp an understanding of the game, i.e (choosing your lanes, your playstyle, the tech tree, where to shoot on what tanks) because it shows armor penetration shadings. Matchmaking is much better than WOT PC as the tank stats are balanced (sort of) for 1 to 2 tier match ups. 
Compared to WOT PC, Blitz is more fast-paced but at the same time, also more relaxed. And I like the fact that grinding in Blitz is very nice compared to WOT PC. You don't need premium account or premium tanks to get credits, but WG give it to you anyway on many occasions (crates, events, etc.), as well as gold from time to time, in which you can save up to get premium tanks of your liking. 
It has its bugs and glitches sometimes, (For me, heavy ping spikes on all modes whenever Gravity Force mode is available), but every game has it. The only sad part is that, I think there's too many children playing this game (AFK, having no idea what to do or where to go) and it kind of ruins the game for me. 
All in all, I think it's a great tank-arcade game if you're into it. Don't expect something realistic from any WG franchises. It's just a game."
4215,very nice game.
4216,"It is a phone game ported to PC and it just can't compete with other tank games such as War Thunder. It does have many, many different tanks but there is little variety among them between factions though there are a few that are unique such as the Tortoise. Just overall I can't recommend it when there are much better alternatives like War Thunder."
4217,its so awsome at least better then my glitched game that i used to play
4218,nice very nostalgic
4219,"turn off your cht and enjoy the game, if you like being called a moron and other choice things then leave chat on, but overall once you get past the cry babies its a pretty good game, i wish there was modes for serious players versus the goof offs but it is what it is, and its all about the money , you will be bombarded with offer to get the next best tank etc but you dont have to buy."
4220,"I've been playing this for a while now. I love it's mechanics and how much simpler are them compared to the regular World of Tanks.

It has the same problems that the regular one, though. Mostly because of the premium tanks problem, which they refuse to nerf even if the community begs for it. These tanks are too asequible if you have the money to pay for them, which brings a lot of new players to Tiers that shouldn't be able to reach so quickly and, because of that, they're too inexperienced to play properly or collaborate with their team."
4221,"It's incredibly grindy, and at about tier 8 unless your a literal god and always get good teammates, you end up not profiting."
4222,this game is dead half the players are bots this game has been dead since 2016
4223,fun and no stress
4224,mantap lah!!
4225,teams are still trash
4226,its fun
4227,World of Tanks Blitz is a fantastic compact version of the World of Tanks game. I enjoy it more on the PC than the mobile version. Has good graphics and the controls are easy to learn. Also you don't have to buy in game items or boosts to be successful. My only issue with the game is the pricing at the in game shop. To rich for my blood. Still it's fun to play regardless.

4258,"My favorite game. Easy to start, hard to master. But possible :D
The game provides pretty good graphics, pretty simple UI and game mechanics, it is well-optimised (you can literally play this on a coca-cola can; yet not really successful), and it stimulates you to think of the best strategy, depending of your teams abilities and to communicate with teammates fast and understandable as well as improve your own playing skill. 
The other good aspect of the game that it is really not a ""pay to win"". Of course there can be a lot of premium tanks and other cool things but all this is really well-balanced, so you feel comfortable even playing against premiums. And, by the way, you can get many premium tanks for free.
You also won't get bored of similar gameplay because developers regularly add really cool game modes, playing which is a lot of fun. So grab your friends and come here :)

If you have any troubles with understanding of the game mechanics, you can write me and I will help you :D (EU server; nickname: Dmytry___)

My rating is 9/10

4299,"This is a full-frontal assault on all other tank battle games and victory is in sight.
World of Tanks Blitz is an easy to handle and fun to master tank game with a growing following.

The customization aspect is well done, with the amount of camo and mechanical upgrades for your tank. 
The controls are as simple and effective as it gets, while the gameplay takes smooth to another level. 
The maps allow for tactical warfare and a  steady speed of play that forces you to change your strategy in real-time.

My only real complaint with the game is there isn't enough of it, but I suppose leaving the players wanting more is a side effect of a successful recipe.
More game modes and maps would be a welcome addition to Blitz, but in the game's defence, there is still more than enough to stay engaged and loyal, especially as a FREE game."

4318,"[spoiler]Yes, I only have 2 hours on steam for this game. I mainly played this game on phone. Playing this game on PC is a bit of a taboo among higher skilled players as it gives you an advantage when it comes to aiming and a few other small aspects[/spoiler]

WoT Blitz is your usual WG game. You have 2 teams with an equal amount of vehicles (ranging from tier 1 to 10) fighting against each other in a range of gamemodes. In WoT Blitz's case it's 7v7 tank combat on decently sized maps. WoT Blitz only has 2 gamemodes and those are encounter and supremacy. Encounter is your usual capture a big base in the middle of the map kind of game mode while supremacy consists of 3-4 caps that give you points over time, maxing out at 1000. To win a game either team has to either complete the objective of the gamemode or destroy the entirety of the enemy team.

It's a relatively simple concept on paper but when you factor in all the in-game mechanics you get quite a game with a decent learning curve. First and foremost, WoT Blitz is an arcade tank game. The majority of its tanks are based off the real thing but there are numerous prototypes, concepts and just completely made up tanks. For some reason people complain about this but I'd say its the least important issue with the game.

I'll mainly talk about 2 aspects of the game: Casual and Competitive (or Comp for short).

As a casual game, blitz is above average at best. It's very grind heavy game. Grinding through the lower tiers is a breeze. Although after update 5.5 it has become quite a boring breeze. The issues start once you get to tier 7 and 8. At these tiers, it becomes near impossible to grind for credits which are used to buy tanks and equipment for your tank. You simply don't make enough to turn a profit. This is obviously done intentionally to coax you into buying premium tanks. Premium tanks earn more credits and xp than a normal tank. While it is possible to receive a premium tank for free, you will usually only receive low tier premiums. If you want to effectively grind for credits you need to buy a tier 8+ premium. I personally don't have an issue with this as spending 10-20 quid isn't too big of a deal but this is basically a big middle finger to f2p players.

As for the combat itself, it's not top difficult once you start using your head. Each map usually has 2 flanks, one flank is usually an urban area for heavies and the other flank will usually be a hilly rural area for mediums and lights. The middle is usually a mix of both and it is where you'll usually find the encounter cap. While this doesn't apply for all the maps in the game, that is the general status quo. As for where you go, that all depends on what tanks are in your team but usually a map has a preferred flank to play on. I won't go into further detail here as this is not a guide.

Overall, playing the game casually is enjoyable if you're willing to spend a bit of money. The overall skill level of the game is low. If you simply learn from your mistakes it's easy to improve. [b]Although, If you only want to play this game casually, then I don't recommend playing it and I sure as hell don't recommend spending money on it.[/b]

Personally, I play this game for the Comp scene.
Every day or two, there will be a tournament in the evening. Tournaments are a bit different from normal battles;

In a normal game you go in blind with +/-1 matchmaking (tanks can only be the same tier or one tier above/below you)
In a tournament you instead get shown the map you will play on in advance. You will then have an allocated amount of time for you and your team to pick tanks of the required tier (6/8/10). Also, the team you are part of must be registered for the tournament, so instead of playing with some random people you don;t know you can play with friends or clanmates over discord.

While it may not sound that different, its a completely different ball game. Instead of having pitiful calls like 'left' or 'right' you are facing teams that can prepare their positions prior to starting and can call focus fire to take out tanks much faster. In short, you have to relearn the game from scratch, the learning curve here is much higher. Small mistakes can get you killed in seconds when playing against skilled teams. Getting into comp as a whole takes a lot of time and commitment and you don't even get a big reward from it. But the comp scene alone is what makes this game great. Even with WG actively trying to ruin their game and the toxic community, comp is a lot of fun.

While this isn't exactly a flex I can be proud of, I can actually call myself a semi-professional WoT Blitz player. Back in the 2020/21 Winter Season I earned around 180$ for reaching 5th/6th in the Professionals tournament on EU with VE1L and 7th/8th in the Prof. tournament on NA with PNCR. Blitz isn't a major esport in any way and it never will be. But if you want to play a game on a competitive level and earn some pennies, WoT Blitz ain't too bad...

[spoiler]p.s PC players aren't allowed to participate in any major tournaments as it provides a slight advantage. Can't believe WG actually did something good[/spoiler]

[spoiler]p.p.s I have skipped a crap ton of context here so if you want any more info on this game, and especially the comp scene, just write to me on steam or discord Pavel#7303[/spoiler]"
4319,So far so good.
4320,THE GAME WILL NOT MATCH YOU UP FAIRLY. WHEN IT WANTS YOU TO WIN IT PUTS YOU ON A STRONG TEAM. WHEN IT WANTS YOU TO LOSE IT PUTS YOU WITH WEAK PLAYERS. COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.
4321,good
4322,Like this game
4323,"Seems like everyone else has more armor, damage,penetration,speed,able to shoot very easily while on the move and their tanks are so fast that it would put the road runner to shame, if you like games where you will loose 80%of the time and you have to grind for days on end just to get 1 upgrade for your early level tank then this is your game. None of my tanks are able to keep up with anyone in this game, only way to keep up with most of the players is to spend huge amounts of money on buying the best tanks and upgrading them and then spending another huge wad of cash on constantly buying special ammo for your tank which you will have to keep topping up very often."
4324,"Unlike the normal World of Tanks, Blitz has special gamemodes and special tanks. I love this game and I keep playing even though I have been grinding for a tier 10 for 2 years now. I first played 6 years ago and I love it."
4325,"This game is a very fun game, ive played it since 2015. Solid game, Solid tanks, good war espect"
4326,This game is quite tense even when the last moment of my tank
4327,If you try out a tank and don't like it you can sell it back for credits. I like all the different boosters and monthly themed tanks in premium pass. Lots of fun to play.
4328,"this is a nice game, it has pretty realistic graphics, along with good and fun modes, however, you have to grind a ton just to get 1 upgrade"

4334,"When you first start playing this game, expect your WR to be around 30-45% since you don't know the game mechanics. I'm a light tank driver and I can tell you that mobility is important and you can get from one side of the map to the other quickly. However, if you really want advice on playing better, you can just try searching for tutorials but those generally mean nothing if you don't understand it. Go play a few thousand battles and you'll probably improve a whole lot."
4335,grindy asf but good game anyways

4355,russian bias is real
4356,"This is a great game but has balancing issues. This game is more like of Consume-to-Win + Pay-to-Win and is not actually meant for F2P only players. You still can play F2P until you reached Tier-8, having negative credits without using credits boosters are really nasty and this game has very bad match-ups to balance both teams. Your odds of winning is already determined before the actual combat starts.

I recommend it if you just want to have fun but other than that, there's pretty much nothing on this game that I could appreciate."
4357,Very enjoyable
4358,Very fun and fast paced tank game. Would recommend trying it out
4359,game would be better if it didn't lag so frequently
4360,this game is pretty good but there are some things that need to be fixed i.e the matchmaking
4361,cooooooooooooooooooooooooool
4362,"Take a pass. There're severe balance issues, severe lag issues, and an apathetic company behind it all. The goal of Wargaming is to get you frustrated enough to spend real money, not to actually provide a decent game."
4363,"Fun, Sometimes"
4364,Its Amazing ! Feels good to play
4365,so fun i would recomend it
4366,This a a fun game so easy to progress but can be annoying with people that don't help or are not at the same skill level
4367,forces you to pay past tier 8 or gtfo
4368,:)
4369,"To Be Honest Most of my time playing on World of Tank Blitz was very mixed in experience, I really Like it but sometimes The Matchmaking is kinda unfair for us or the opposing team it would be best if they balanced the matchmaking for the best experience for both of the teams.

And from the (kinda) P2W tank the Smasher and Annihilator is still powerfull on all matches if an experienced player used it,
I think it would be best to nerf it a bit for the F2P players to get an good experience rather just getting destroyed immediately.

And New players it would be best if you start off using simple tanks like Heavy Tanks but stick with your role as an Heavy Because I see Heavy tank like an KV-3 Sniping in the back line Rather on the Frontline,
And if you can try to watch a tutorial they will give very great advice on using tanks and how to play them.

So from that i recommend this game but try to make it fun as possible if you guys Can.
Happy Hunting."
4370,good game
4371,It's really fun with friends. I was playing and we just had a big laugh basically the whole time.
4372,A really great programme but unless you are prepared to continually spend money to buy gold you will never get past basic equipment. Could cost a fortune.
4373,"Nothing like coming back today after not playing since August 28, 2019. Remembering why I quit now. Imagine using an RNG mechanic to control shell dispersion. I'd go play war thunder but that shit sucks too."
4374,hi
4375,The gameplay itself is actually pretty nice and satisfying but in my opinion it would be the best of its class if you could buy new tanks easier as you rank up. You need to spend much more time and effort to buy tanks of lvl 5 when compared to the time you need spend to buy tanks of lvl 4 for example.
4376,ok
4377,"Premium members have an overwhelming advantage.
"
4378,its ok
4379,It's Good but the matchmaking kinda take a lot of time

4383,"The game has a lot of differences compared to the original PC version, but it's very good overall. There are a lot of vehicles to choose from and the offers (which are significantly cheaper than in the original) help with grinding. And there are often events available to offer even more hours of fun."
4384,Wot was originally the smartphone version of the PC game Wot. And as you might be able to tell from reading only that this version of the game is quite a bit smaller in terms of both Content and GB it will use on your PC :D. The graphics are not close to as good as they are in the full version of the game but it was added to Steam long before the full version and as somebody who has played both I guarantee it's not worth the switch. enjoy ;D

4391,"I used to play this game before it even published in steam store
After playing over 40k games on 3 different account i think im qualified to have fair review on this game
Gameplay are excellent you can get used to it very fast and its simple not like pc version of World Of Tanks
graphic are good (remember this game is made for mobile devices)
7 vs 7 pvp in my opinion for now is a perfect number maps dont need to get bigger and so it wont put too much pressure on your phone and lots of people with some old phones like me can still enjoy the game
.
.
BUT
.
.
There is some cons which forced me to stop playing this game
The grinding is too heavy in my opinion
because its a free to play game devs push their way too much to milk the game as much as they can i mean at first it was only premium tanks and account with some you can say easy events which even f2p gamers could get some premium tanks with some hard work. it was simple and you could buy few rare premium tanks only in store for limited time
But than they introduced boxes which you had only 2.5% chance to win the tank (my gambling habit started from there)
I remember i paid over 80$ to get the tank i want which normally you should pay 40$ in store
They makes the events harder so there was no possible way to get to the end without paying (maybe there was as long as you dont eat,sleep or work and just play WOTB in the entire event XD)
.
.
JUST like most the FREE TO PLAY games this one become a PAY TO WIN as well
But as long as you got patience and some friend to play with
It still can be FUN"
4392,"Epic game, minor pay to win"
4393,垃圾服务器
4394,just like what the ads say and i research say its damnn.... good classic but very challenging putting tankers to there limits and pushing there tactics at its limit s every scenario should be consider for the success of every battle is the key to victory
4395,My friend is severely addicted to this garbage game and no one should ever play it
4396,wish they'd fix balancing but its ok overall
4397,its gud
4398,"garbage game, pay to win just like war game red dragon!"
4399,very low quality
4400,A good game but the people running it is absolutely retarded. You will get banned unfairly without any warning or appeal. Do not spend any money because you can lose it all.
4401,Tank go boom
4402,IT'S OK
4403,In one word: Excellent
4404,Good Game :)
4405,"it is not bad
"
4406,"Basically WoT but better. less grinding, more generous rewards for playing (e.g. better daily mission reward, free boosters, events and battle pass reward even for free tier. ) espicially clan mission that gives you a lot of bonus. Gameplay is much more faster at ~5 min. I moved to Blitz since War Thunder was too much grind for me and for WoT having removed tank weakspots for some reason and getting bored of Arty. If you played WoT before, you would settle right in just fine.

The graphic is obviously lesser than WoT but it isn't ugly for a mobile game and your PC should be able to run smoothly without any framedrop.

The downside of this game is the player on your team. Just like other similar titles, this game also suffer from questionable teammate decision that led to your defeat, This happened mostly at lower tier (up to tier V or VI) since those players haven't fully learned about the game yet and it's really fast to get a low tiers vehicle. But from tier VII, it's really enjoyable to play. Also, some of the premium tanks are a bit OP for its tier.

Overall, This game is fun either you want to play in a long run or just occasionally hop in when you have nothing else to do."
4407,"its a good quick and fun game that can be enjoyable 
it has a lot of RNG but other then that its good"
4408,Fun game  more  like an arcade game than war thunder.  lots of advertising trying to get you to buy stuff for the game  overall fun short games. At the lower levels easy to capture the flag  because everyone else is fighting each other

4430,"[h1] The collapse of Events in this game. [/h1]
I've been playing this for like what, 5 years? And i've seen Wargaming deteriorate to the point of absolute Pay2Win. The worst thing that I can mention here is the Events, which are absolute bullshit now. Back in the day they used to be fun and you could actually grind for them easily, and maybe get some free tanks along the way. But this ain't the case anymore. Now you have this entire ""battle pass"" bullshit. And it keeps on going. They just keep shitting out a new tank and some premium battle pass thing for 5 €. Why would anyone wanna spend their money on this shit.
Oh and yeah, the tank isn't free. You have to get the premium battle pass.
Also, this game gives you gambling addiction from the shitloads of crates in which most of them have a 1% to 5% chance of dropping a tier 10 premium tank to make you look cool."
4431,good game
4432,"Not recommend to F2P player
why ? 
- the tier 8 above battle its absolutely unbalanced, u will get rekt mostly by unicum player with their premium tanks and shells
- the tier 10 tank cost to repair its absolutely expensive for each battle
- mostly u need premium ammo when u going to tier 8 or above"

4443,"For the new players of World of Tanks Blitz here, I am an experienced player. wotb is a game with fun gamemodes and things to do. The game has events sometimes wherein you can get premium tanks for FREE. Although, this game has 2-3 issues for me. 1st is that it is PAY TO WIN. there are overpowered tanks in the game, well Wargaming (the dev) needs to make money so, 2nd, The balancing. Sometimes the game in uptier is inbalanced for example, the enemy team having super op tanks while you have just ""good"" tanks. And lastly, 3rd. The toxicity of the Asia server. WoTB's Asia server is very toxic, and I am in it. Its like make a simple mistake, even IN LOW TIER, you get called out. Thats all my problems. If it were fixed, the game would be more and more enjoyable!

Have fun new commanders!"
4444,a
4445,"-Pay to win
-Screen is FULL of premium promotion stuffs."
4446,"dont expect to have a high winrates as team you get put with are generally worse than the enemys, so expect to loose.

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WATCH A TUTORIAL ON HOW TO PLAY THE GAME PLEASE!!!!!"
4447,good game
4448,epic is epoic
4449,"it fun do it
"
4450,supis
4451,good
4452,its a great game my only issue is that sometimes it can feel a little pay to win sense the game is free you can spend money on gold and tanks and if you join a lobby where everybody spent money but you it will be gameover very fast
4453,"It is fun to play. A pint size world of tanks you can play on mobile or on pc. Gameplay is generally fun and that limited time per round keeps the gameplay fast paced.  Want something to kill boredom, play world of tanks blitz. :-D"
4454,good
4455,"Badly balanced game, physics is questionable and very camping heavy game. Would play again,"
4456,Its a lot of fun if you only want a brief gaming session while enjoying tanks and the eventual saltiness
4457,i love this game so much! its very fun to play and its cool to play because its so fun! this game is so fun to play because of how cool it is when you play it for fun!! i love playing with my friends because they always mention how cool it is when we play and thats super fun!
4458,"good. support very low end spec, in 2GB ram. my pc can reach 55fps. not bad
"
4459,Probably worth having more than the WoT
4460,eh
4461,nice
4462,YOHHHH
4463,.
4464,I love tanks so any tank game is a good game
4465,fun and can get addictive fast
4466,"Очень классная, а главное динамичная игра, чего не скажешь про ""большого"" брата!"
4467,"Really nice game
"
4468,"At least it's better than War Thunder.
But seriously, we need some sort of PC-Console crossplay whether it be the Original or Blitz version."
4469,"it is a perfect game if u like tanks 
"
4470,"This game is a blast.

I play on the EU server and I have been playing it for almost 7 years. I don't have many battles on my account but none the less I have always enjoyed playing it. I would totally recommend WOTB to anyone with a phone or tablet or who has a non-gaming and old laptop like myself.

There is a variation of game modes you can play, Supremacy where you have to capture 3 or more bases and be the first team to get to 1000 points or Encounter which is mostly based on killing the enemy team or capping the one base near the centre of the map to 100 points which doesn't normally happen. Unlike WOT PC this version is designed for tablet and phone and so the teams are 7 vs 7 instead of being 15 vs 15. Not only is there Encounter and Supremacy modes but there are also fun game modes that come out once in a while. These Modes consist of Uprising, Mad Games, Burning Games, Skirmish Mode, and last but not least Realistic Battles. The game is based upon a tier system and tech trees. You start off with a tier 1 vehicle and you have to get XP from battles to upgrade your tank's modules and then gain more XP to research the next tank above it. The higher the tier tank, the more XP required to research it. Along with this every battle you get credits, which you will need to use in order to equip and buy tanks. There is a wide variety of over 450 tanks and a selection of which the tanks come from. There are also different types of vehicles, so the normal variant is just a white name when in your garage and then there are collector vehicles which have a light blue coloured name and premium vehicles which the majority of the time you have to pay real money in order to get them. There name colour is gold. These are just the fundamental parts of the game and and overview of what it's like, but there are other things when playing the game such as map awareness and teamwork which come in handy when playing in order to try and win for your team.

There are unfortunately downsides to this game but don't make them deter you from getting it. Firstly, Crates. Yes, Crates. Any people who play this game would know exactly what I am talking about, They are completely luck based, and you have a very small percent chance of getting the desired tank out of the crate that you purchase with real money (You can sometimes buy them just with gold if you have that much). They are a business so they have to make money. But the main things that annoy people is selling crates for tanks that are not high tiers. Selling crates for £20+ for a CHANCE to get a tank... not guaranteed... for a tier 6 or 7 tank should not be a thing. Many people disagree with this and think that crates are bad enough and so selling tier 6 or 7 tanks is just too far. Another thing to note are things such as toxic teams and players who are inexperienced. There is nothing stopping a player who has had the game for two days and who has only played tier 1, to buy tier 10 crates - get lucky - and then play at tier 10 with 0 to none experience. People also rage and are toxic when the game doesn't go their way. Such as the teams not supporting them or going in another direction to them.

All this aside, overall the game is really fun to play. There is no in game voice chat, But there is a chat where you can tap commands such as attack, or hold position etc. You can also type and communicate to your team. You can platoon with people. There are global chats in game where you can talk to people in your language. There are also clans that you can join or make. And there are training rooms you use if you want to try something different in the game rather than shooting red guys.


Don't know if this review will come in handy, but if you read it - install the game - and love it, I'm glad to have been a part of that.
If you love tanks and can't run WOT PC then give this game a go. It's FREE and is worth a try."
4471,best of if you like wars!! 10/10*******
4472,this game is just amazing some crashes and gliches but always deletes itself:(
4473,Fun Game to pass some time
4474,"good
"
4475,"Its a good tank game. The tanks are realistic, the game isn't grindy like WT and the extra game modes like mad games etc make it even more fun. Only problem is that its slightly p2w."
4476,Make my day
4477,Played this game on mobile for 7 years and now playing on PC. Love the game. 10 out of 10 would recommend.
4478,Fun game for a free game ngl.

4480,sometimes its a bit grindy but is pretty fun
4481,stay at low tier until you have a few hundred battles and take it easy dont yolo
4482,idk its a moving car with armor and big pew pew
4483,"I used to play this game waaayyy back when it came out 7 years ago. It has evolved a whole bunch since then, and for the most part the changes are great. It feels less difficult to grind for higher tier tanks which is wonderful.
My one complaint goes towards the fact that until Tier IV/Tier V, you'll find yourself playing against AI's.
This is only a tiny complaint, but I'd prefer to play against actual people rather than bots, as it makes the experience much more engaging.
But as I said, this practice only occurs until Tier IV so its a minor inconvenience.
Overall a great game."
4484,"Good game, but have connection problems."
4485,Bro it do be fun
4486,"WoT is very competitive, easy to hard its all here in this game, come to play and learn if you don""t you will be left behind, but not to worry there are many who you can learn from if you are willing."
4487,"Would still play the game. Too many AI. They have gamer ID but once u try to add em or look at their stats, nothing, not even a game. Just the one they did. U can easily see them always acting the same and the target mechanic is just horrible. But at least they got that into the matchmacking so, ull get the same amount of player/AI ratio most of the time. Its a good game but uve been warned. It will be a match about the one who know how to farm AI win. If u manage to kill the player at the start then ull have NP to get crazy Stats/XP. Still recommand the game as i did not try ranked to see if theres AI out there so my hope for this positive review like ranked got no AI."
4488,good
4489,"good
"
4490,This game is amazing you can customize your own tanks! You can battle your way to victory so play Word of Tanks Blitz Today!
4491,Somehow better than normal World of Tanks
4492,"Great Game for just relaxing and blowing up tanks. No gore and blood, so that is nice, especially if you have kids."
4493,I just like the interaction
4494,hamburger
4495,world of tanks is better than blitz
4496,"Я поиграл , и вот что могу сказать. Это идеальная игра для садомазахистов , ведь таких садомазо приколов вы не найдете ни в одной игре ! Если вы любите долбится в жопу со своими БРАТЬЯМИ - танкистами. Можете не раздумывая скачивать эту игру ! Но если вы нормальный человек без умственных отклонений , то лучше не пробуйте в это играть ._."
4497,"- Too much pay to win
- Match Making Rigged
- Lootboxs with Drop chance of 0.05 everywhere for anything
- Bug like ghost shells still not corrected 
- Event cheated

Dont wast your time for this game and dont spend money on it."
4498,"this game is meant to be played on android and nintendo switch, for pc I would definitely suggest World Of Tanks and not World Ot Tanks Blitz."
4499,"Don't, Just Don't
for your own good don't play it"
4500,TANKS!!!!!
4501,5/5 good game
4502,fun
4503,It's a really addictive gameplay. It does not get old
4504,"I played this game when I had free time and bored aboutplaying the same games. For some new game experience you can try this game for free. But pay to win factor hits after some point. So do not consider this a ""free to play competitive game"" because if you want to compete you will have to pay some amount of money. though you can absolutely have fun playing this game especially if you are in a transition period of some games."
4505,That's great Tank battle game! I love her.
4506,"What I like about this game:
1. The playstyle in general
2. The short paced action unlike WOT Pc
3. A huge variety of tanks
4. Decent events even some F2P ones
5. Constantly receiving updates making the game better(well mostly)
6. System requirements is very low

What I dont like about this game:
1. The general player base
2. The tutorial
3. The maps are kinda too small
4. The balancing team(they either bring insane op tanks(which make their tech tree counter part useless) or absolutely useless tanks)
5. Too much salt
6. Easy to get high tier tanks with money
7. Playing for free for a new player is rly hard mostly due to credits
8. Bringing imaginary tanks made by these developers themselves, like Helsing, Dracula, Smasher, Annihilater, Lycan, etc
9. RNG has a huge influence in this game
10. T7 and T8 are filled with OP premiums and collectors"
4507,"If you are looking for a game with tanks along with being funny,here you are
I never thought tanks could be funny until I got to know this game
But there are problems with matchmaking that I did not like at all.Skill is more important than the tank used, at least most of the time"
4508,This is a game you will have a love-hate relationship with. Not a lot more to say than that tbh
4509,This game is amazing! It's much better than any other game on the market(my opinion). I hope people will get the same joy i have out of it when they play it!
4510,"Great game but you have to sort ""get into it"" and learn to play to find it really enjoyable"
4511,"good free to play
"
4512,Used to enjoy this game. Kinda pay-to-win in my oppinion.
4513," Just uninstalled for the third time. Game has the same problems as real world of tanks. As players are allowed to fail their way higher tiers, the overwhelming majority do. WG likes this because in the higher tiers you lose game currency which WG hopes will get you to purchase premium time or a premium tank.

 For example, on an average team in WOT (15 players) tier 8-10 game, you'll get 4 guys with a winning record, 7 guys who should have stopped at tier 5 until they learned how to win and 4 guys who never should have been allowed past tier 2.

 Makes you miss old school gaming -  where if you couldn't beat level 1 you stayed there forever and the higher tiers were for people who EARNED the level."
4514,Great game and a lot of events
4515,"I like it, its pretty easy to grind to tier 10, unlike wot pc"
4516,TONK
4517,It is amazing
4518,"Nice graphics, with the best gameplay experience for a light version."
4519,anyone that loves tank will love this make them jump for joy
4520,Hot garbage
4521,no tryharding game
4522,This is a very beautyfull game from ather people!!!! Thanks wery much!!!!
4523,"This game are suck and bad because when you buying premium tanks they useless, if you buy the tank for 7500 GOLD they become useless
Also season pass how about him the fucking case's needed buy battel pass
Another if you want not buy gold and get premium tank you needed fucking get the 25 gold at case somewhere 1% or more the tanks cost 2500 - 7500 GOLD Wtf dude also there fucking useless things like some hat and etc and they cost again money or gold so this why this game too bad."
4524,"Literally pay to win game, you wont have fun unless you pay :)"
4525,Good graphics! I found myself enjoying the game a lot
4526,It's a great game for those who like tanks and shooting games!
4527,its very fun game to play!
4528,fun way to kill some time. probably play for about 1-2 hrs a day.
4529,<3
4530,good and fun to play
4531,like
4532,"Not like the other WOT that puts you in battles 3-4 tiers above your tier.  Also, don't see the issues that regular WOT has (like shooting through a solid concrete bridge and killing you, but no damage to the bridge).  This is much more enjoyable and fair."
4533,"Gotta spend real money to get ahead, pay to win."
4534,very nice
4535,"Great game
"
4536,"If u looking for rage simulator, this game are perfect for you"
4537,k
4538,"This game is for everyone loving tanks lot's of choice lots of people overall is a greawt game :D
"
4539,tank goes brrrr
4540,huwaw sangat sehat sekali maen wotb tuh
4541,good game
4542,gg
4543,cool
4544,not like the other games out there
4545,"The Positives of the Game:
- It is pretty nice graphically for what was a mobile game and does have the ability to run on lesser PCs.
- It has a variety of tanks on each tree with the exclusion of Japan (and possibly China) who have lackluster tanks but are still fun to play with.
 - For me, the game is not paid to win as you do not HAVE to pay to get far into the game, and you can take part in the events and gain rewards which helps lessen the grinding component.
 - The game is fun to play and easily accessible to newer players and although I've only had it on Steam and played for under 100 hours, I've played on mobile about 5 years ago and I still haven't gotten bored of this game.

Now that I've pointed out the positive let's go to the negative:
- As before mentioned there is a grinding aspect that of which isn't as horrendous as other Wargaming titles and non-Wargaming titles (Such as War Thunder).
- The grinding aspect also enforces a slight pay to win problem as it makes people want to buy Premium, Gold, and Premium Tanks/Collector Tanks, these are all available through events without the cost of money, but at the same time, you can just purchase your way through some of the events eliminating the grind.

The game is good if you were to ignore the slight pay-to-win mechanic in the game as nearly everything in the game is available for everybody through the source of events and grinding which brings a constant stream of play and enjoyment for people like myself."
4546,It has tanks
4547,its alright
4548,Awesome Game . It is great to Strategize and Learn and how to defeat your opponents using guts and brain power and most of all each game is quick
4549,This is a GREAT game the only thing bad is that I have to get it from Steam. The issue I have with steam is that it uninstalls the game every time I turn my computer off. In other words Game = good Steam = bad
4550,Good game but buying gold is costly. Only premium ammo is giving good damage to  enemy. But over all game is good.
4551,"The game is great! Just wish the place was not as laggy as my last rounds I played. I have 1 complaint... WHERE IS THE MARK IV BRITISH TANK?!? I looked in the upgrades list for the British tanks and It wasn't even there. Your shaming my favorite tank from WW1 man. Cmon.


(This is a joke btw. Still wish they had the Mark IV British Tank tho.)"
4552,"P2W and stupid player from mother land
Trash game i have play"
4553,good game
4554,bro i love this game it is full of fun and tanks and very great graphics bro
4555,"yeah
"
4556,"Definitely a P2W game. ""Premiums,"" tanks and ammo you can buy with gold; the game's paid for currency (which can be earned in some circumstances), will always leave F2P players at a disadvantage. It was fun for a while, but when I found War Thunder (one of this game's competitors) it was an instant switch. RNG for shell trajectory? HP for tanks? It just doesn't appeal to me."
4557,Needless to say I've played this game at minimum 2k hours starting from late 2015 and only recently have I found that it is on steam and have been playing the shit out of it now using my amazing (compared to using tablet) aim to seal club all the guys I used to be equal footing with. fun game but fuck you wargaming p2w asshats.
4558,"It's a fun game once you understand the mechanics and become familiar with the maps. If you are an experienced player from old school World of Tanks, you may feel the need to take a shower every few games. At least until you get to the higher tiers and join the rest of your filthy seal clubbing trolls."
4559,Very fun game
4560,"its a pretty fun game, would recommend"
4561,is a good game and then neh :/
4562,топ
4563,"Reasons I dont recomend this game:

Unbalanced maps: if both teams have equal skill, one side has a clear advantage due to terrain/positions/speed in to key positions.

Matchmaking: literally not a single filter to make matchmaking balanced, winrate, avarage damage, number of battles, nothing matters. (if the avarage player were more skilled that wouldnt be a problem, but most players have no clue how to play)

Both upper points make so that 90% of the games are heavily one-sided, having one team destroy the other in barely 2-3 minutes, that leaves you either in a losing team uncapable of doing anything, or on the wining team fighting your onw team-mates to get some damage done, either way, neither side ends enjoying the battle.

Not working report/punishement options: afks every single game, kamikazes rushing in to dead in the first 30 seconds, ""E 100's"" flanking around the map with a light tank syndrome, frontline heavy tanks camping in the back... you name it

Incredibly toxicity in the chat, both from kids and people that just insults for being bad and lack of undestanding the game (consecuently geting mad) and from experienced players in risposte to your team not playing correctly, not listening to advice, etc etc. (Personally, i'm not bothered by this (but by the causes of it), but some people could not cope with this, making it a point to not being able to play the game)

The biggest problem is, even tho these problems i stated could be easily fixed, the company runing the game DOES NOT LISTEN TO ANY FORM OF FEEDBACK, not even from theyr own comunity contribuitor(CC) /youtubers, wich makes the problems above eternal, and i dont think they will ever be adressed if people keeps paying and giving them money

To note that the PC version of the game is having the same issues, and the company still is not fixing anything.

Misconceptions: The game is not p2w as a lot of people mention, i played for almost 3 years now being f2p(+500 hours on steam pc, more before on mobile devices)
As long as you enter the game on the phone to watch ADs, you can get 18.500 gold a year (50g a day, x5 ads) enough to buy any premium tank, therefore having an easy source of credits to climb up the tech tree

4606,"I have played this game for like 7 years and it went downhill since they removed half of tanks in tech trees. Low tiers are somewhat playable, mid tiers (4-6) are unplayable bc of completly imaginary tanks which are OP AF.
As always WG ruins their good games with P2W mechanics. If u don't pay, don't play this crap."
4607,
4608,Great game
4609,Pretty fun
4610,Very fun lol
4611,NICE!
4612,"Well. Where do I begin. This game... is alright. I enjoy it way more than WoT PC.

[h1][b]Positives[/b][/h1]

• Battles are fast thanks to 7 tank teams and 7 minute batte limit
• Way more newbie friendly than WoT PC
• WG's team for WoTB is more generous towards the players (but not always)
• No Self-Propelled Guns, which means that you can be more aggresive
• Okayish balance of the tanks (except Annihaltor, Smasher and other OP s h i t e s)
• Not that many offers, that are basically rip off

[h1][b]Negatives[/b][/h1]

• Mostly incompetent teams, that will deteriorate your ingame experience
• Rather idiotic Matchmaker
• Some tanks are straight out OP, but cannot be nerfed due to their premium status
• A lot of microtransactions (let's be honest here, that's every f2p game in nutshell)

[h1][b]Tips[/b][/h1]
• Do not rush for tier X tanks if you are a newbie. Take it slowly and play low tier tanks (IV - VI) to gain enough experience before joining higher tier battles. Trust me, otherwise you will struggle.
• Watch tutorials on YT. The videos here are way more informative than those on official game sites.
• If you are a newbie, go for well armoured tanks first, like T1 Heavy, ARL 44 or KV-1. They are more forgiving when you do a mistake. But don't be shy to try out some more skill based tanks, that do not have much armour.

[h1][b]Final verdict[/b][/h1]

The game is alright. I didn't spend that much of money in it, yet I was able to gather a fairly big amount of gold, I used to buy premium tanks. Sometimes there are very nice events, where you can get a good premium tank for free. Something like Mission Marathons in WoT PC, but superb in terms of doabilty. The gameplay itself is basically slower WoT. As already mentioned the teams are the biggest problem. If you're a good player (55% and above) you'll notice it rapidly. The Matchmaker will put you into teams with people that are always 49% and less and act like bots. This means that you cannot relly on your team as much as you would like to and playing support tanks is a pure hell.

If you're interested in this game, then go for it, but I beg you. Please watch the tutorials on YT, there are many YT channels dedicated to WoTB with many useful tips and tricks. This way you will gain expereince way faster."
4613,REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
4614,"if you have a shitty computer and cant run war thunder, if you're a tank person enjoyer, i think this game is suitable for your low spec computer. but i think no one plays with lv1 tanks anymore."
4615,aa
4616,itz ok but more easier on mobile!!!
4617,"At the time i am writing this, i only have 2,5k battles (i have 2 accounts) so i'm a ""new"" player. My first game was in november 2020. I just give my feelings about this game.
So it's a good game, even better than WOT pc (to me). It is easier to unlock tech tree tanks, and u get a free premium tank (almost) every 2-3 month. The R/G is not that bad compared to the WOT pc's one (prepare to be troll by your gun and to oneshot your ennemies because the god of R/G was with you ). But the matchmaking is not very good, u can find yourself fighting against a player that have 20 000 battles while you only have 1000. The worst thing about this game is that the premium tanks u can't get free are OP (Smasher, Annihilator, dracula...), if ur a new or an average player, you are going to get wrecked by those tanks. The graphics are acceptable even if some tanks are more realistic than others, i'm talking about the ""YOH"" tanks. The new update didn't change a lot of things in terms of graphics. But the game is still fun to play alone and with your friend, so i recommend the game."

4621,Good
4622,Love this game un-limited hours of fun.....
4623,"Fun game, would recommend to other people cause its easy to get into and its not pay to play"
4624,its gud i do enjoy
4625,"The Game itself isn't bad, but its become all p2w like the rest of Wargaming's games. I truly loved this game, until they put almost every single new tank in crates with 4-5% chance to even remotely get one.  Now, I think the game has become worse than previous states. I'd suggest the game if I thought it was even semi good. However its not. Either it might be some salty kid angry cause their team was not listening to them, Trolls pushing you around in ttrs, or some of the events actually being garbage in their own right. I know since Wargaming is a big company and such, that they have to put good things behind paywalls, but come on. There is 0 reason to consistently force your players to gamble in crates for hours, with only a 4-5 percent chance to open a tank. The charm system is also a bad idea, cause it costs a very large amount of money to get said 25 charms to unlock the tank with a complete certainty, and I Feel like that can drag people away from your game. Some of the maps are way too small for 7v7, and most games end within 1-2 minutes. Its usually you vs a tier higher than you, so if you're not using a very strong tank at your tier that can actively compete with the tier above you, you're kind of screwed. I enjoy playing in tier 10 games with my t8, because I know I get more XP and such from damage. I'm actively risking myself so I can grind, but thats because I spent hours and hours, days even, comprehensively diagnosing the players and their skill. If you are semi-new to the game, or even a little good, don't go for the +2 platoon setup yet. It takes a lot of skill and management to do more then 1k in that kind of scenario, so unless you can confirm you're skilled enough, or if you are confident enough, please don't try +2 matches.

Have a good day, thanks for looking at my rant, but feel free to voice your opinion in the comments out. Greatnova, signing out, peace."
4626,Good mobile game.
4627,"Its a good game
But matchmacking is trash. I all ways team up with Noobs and often lose cuz of that bc its a team game. i get 3 to 4k dmg every game but my team gets like 1k and this is in Tier X
Its also very grindy so u needa spend alot of time playing"
4628,"This game is a simpler version of WOTs. The strategies are not compatible but similar. The scale is much smaller and tank destroyers are ineffective due to the inability to hide and snipe from a distance. This is more of a bar fight game, Those of you that hate Artie are going to love this game. No Artie."
4629,i have this game on my phone so i have at least 100 hours playing this game in total and i don't regret it
4630,nice
4631,"good game tank

"
4632,Enemy tanks are inpenetrable and you have paper thin armor
4633,"Great way to kill time, if that's all your aim is."
4634,"Given the required specs,the graphics are pretty good.Keeps me busy for hours.8.5/10"
4635,"Crashing !!!!!!
with this new game play mode.... it keeps on crashing...
has crashed like 4 times now !!!!
Devs look into it"
4636,The purest of shit!
4637,"it is a fun game and its free
what more do you want
"
4638,Just i love it
4639,Bad game
4640,"Played during the pandemic (8th Grade) and used to play the original WoT on the Xbox 360 and Xbox One and I will say this it's a smaller version of WoT but it's still the same, good"
4641,Pay2win
4642,misto
4643,"it fun when it not grindy. kinda fell like base free tanks are little weak compared to payed tanks, but that might be me."
4644,Симулятор гачимучи
4645,hmmmmmmmm
4646,best tanki game
4647,"now i love this game, but 1 thing just annoys be to the point where i cant stand playing it.
Once you've chosen a name, you can NEVER change it unless you PAY to change it, there isn't even an option to delete your account"
4648,E
4649,"yes
"
4650,Hard to play :V
4651,gud
4652,this game will try to make u pay for everything
4653,Before i go into detail OF COURSE there are micro transactions but they are optional. Now for the tutorial. I suggest doing it then looking for a beginner guide for futher details on mechanics. The game can be played completely F2P. The game requires grinding wether your F2P or P2W. It will just take time when your free to play. Its easier then WoT PC so if you want a more laid back version its cross platform. You can use your wargaming account as well to keep your progress from your phone if you have played on your phone recently. Everything is not simple but a learning path that requires focus. Hopes this helps! ONCE AGAIN IT HAS A P2W concept at certain points but COMPLETELY optional.
4654,"This game needs a lot of work done on it before it becomes good. Between my phone, tablet and computer I have around 1000 hours, and many of these have been immensely frustrating. Wargaming prioritizes their own wallet before balance, and this is one of the most pay-to-win heavy games i've ever seen. Please avoid!!"
4655,"nice game
"
4656,"Word of Tanks Blitz (""WoTB"") is a tank battle game where two teams of 7 tanks battle on various maps. The main challenge is positioning your tank right to block incoming shots with your armour and to hit the enemy in vulnerable spots. There is a vast selection of tanks available: historical, prototype and fantasy models.
Blitz is the mobile-available version of the ""big brother"" World of Tanks. The main differences are smaller maps and teams and a faster paced gameplay with battles lasting 7 minuts at most.
As in the original many tanks require either real money to purchase or a tedious grind to unlock for free. If you want to have nice tanks quickly, the game can be rather expensive. There are also some minor pay to win aspects such as premium ammo in  the game, but overall premium vs non-premium feels fair and balanced.

I actually like the concept of this game and wanted to give a good review, however I cannot. The reason I decided to thumbs-down is not at all the monetary aspect but rather two very major flaws in ""competitive"" play:

I am a person who enjoys games that are easy to understand but hard to master and require effort to build up one's skill. World of Tanks Blitz sure checks that box.
However a team game should allow for full premade teams (platoons) to join a battle and compete vs. other teams. Without that feature, there will never be serious strategies/tactics on any map.
WoTB only allows platoons in casual gameplay and thus there is no competitive gameplay worth mentioning. In fact the pinnacle of team tactics is often ""all go this same direction"".

Another big minus is the rating system. Mathematically sound rating systems should give lower rated players, who outperform their expected results, larger rating gains than higher ranked teammates, who had a bad game. WoTB however appears to ignore its own impact metrics (damage, kills, spotting, ...) and attributes successes mostly to the higher ranked players while losses are counted towards the lower ranks.
As this system is implemented, the changes in rating after a game give the individual players very little feedback about their actual performance and what should be improved. Often those rating changes even appear to contradict the various other impact stats, that are shown next to them.

As a consequence of those two points - no team-queuing and a mathematically flawed ranking system -  the matchmaking experience is pretty random and chaotic and makes it very difficult to learn from the matches one has played.

All in all WoTB as a game falls way short of the many possibilties offered by its concept and is little more than a rather expensive waste of time."
4657,sadly my account was wiped and i had over one hundred hours of playtime and spent around 30 dollars on this game i had the Masuchen the tier 10 chinese event tank and a lot of other stuff if a moderator is seeing this please contact me and i can verify with screen shots and videos of me playing
4658,"Runs smooth on low end pc and laptops, also quick and easy to get into."
4659,good game
4660,nice
4661,"I would 100% recommend World of Tanks to other people. Especially since the game is free to play, I would tell anyone that even knows what a tank is to try out World of Tanks."
4662,.
4663,I have played a few hours but i like it!!! I need a little u just dinged them!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4664,ILOVE THIS GAME..WONDEFUL GAME..
4665,.
4666,very good.
4667,tank
4668,fun game
4669,fun game works well with my labtop
4670,I like that you can research tanks that are historically correct and that you can drive the tank how you want trough the battle.
4671,it is awsome i have a tier 6 and i only have played 42 hours in this game!
4672,"What can I say? This is currently doing better than the PC variant of this game. Easy to understand tech trees, indication about where you can and cannot fire into enemy tanks, knowing when you are detected, free events to earn tanks and more.
With smaller scale battles, 7v7, you can easily grind through lines to get the tanks you like the look of best. That said, some tiers have been critically affected by power-creep, and I'm not pointing fingers(Tier 7) but this can cause you to lose you mind sometimes. With fun little battle modes on the side, this is a blast to play, especially with your friends or clan-mates. There are loot boxes in the game although not all require you to empty your wallet in the void of greed as some cost gold (a premium in game currency) but what else do you expect, this is 2021 after all! So join the Gustav-Rail Cannon and prepare to blow your opponents away in World of Tanks: Quick and Easy! (What do you mean its called 'Blitz'?)

Warning: This is a online game, where salt and toxicity is to be expected, so make sure that you ammo-rack (one shot) everyone you meet so they can go home and cry in the garage before they uninstall as you smirk at what you have done before being balanced by THE POWER OF STALIN or the Death Star but smaller where you will then do the same thing. Have Fun and be careful not to choke on your aspirations, commander!"
4673,фу
4674,Awesome game.
4675,"AH god game
"
4676,chill game when to rest a bit from Warthunder's Grind
4677,хуйня
4678,its really good and cool game wanna join?
4679,Recently WOT added so many new tanks which are way more powerful than my traditional tanks. I tried my IS3 which was powerful tier 8 tank. So many times I have been the top of losing team average more than 2000 DP. But I have been played hard but been out gunned. World of fantasy tanks. Thanks and bye wot.
4680,"SLOWER, MORE STRATEGY THAN A LOT OF FPS  GAMES, BUT I SUCK AT THOSE."
4681,"I've played the regular WOT client and blitz, put wayyy too much money in the regular game, got sick of the ridiculous tanks and gold ammo spammers they added and saw this. Played this and said to myself ""Why am I playing the other one when I can play this game without the BS tanks and arty, and way less gold ammo?"" So now I play this instead. It ain't perfect, heck no it isn't, but its better than the regular client."
4682,Wow amazing lost connection after first match and cant even connect now.
4683,Don't even try this game. Matchmaking is rigged and premium tanks (purchasable over-powered tanks) are ruining the game. An absolute mess.
4684,"Largely pay to win garbage, but when you arn't auto matched against tanks out or your class you can get a decent game in provided it does devolve into a point blank tank on tank orgy, It's armor penetration system is never explained and despite your gun saying it's average penetration is well over the enemies armor your going to bounce 9/10 shots in most tanks and do no damage. Unless you target tiny specific points on a tank that woulds be either be more armored or have 0 effect on the tanks performance if struck, I've taken more damage to BS hatch shots then one person should, you look at your tank and 1/2 of the time all the shots are in 1 spot like this is the weak point everyone knows shoot here then you try the same thing and your shots still bounce. The BS armor system compels you to pay real money for premium currency to have all your shots basically ignore any tanks armor values and and do like 3 times as much damage compared to a normal AP shell. Oh and on to premium currency, I've never seen a game that actually monetized XP!! Like, What the Actual F***!! They are constantly spamming you with ads to buy 'Premium Tanks' fully geared tanks who's XP accumulation is greater than that of normal tanks but also is completely useless to you unless you give them more money to convert it into usable XP. It's shady, nickel and dime monetization tactics like this that gamers hate and WoT is packed to the brim with this kind of BS."
4685,the game is good IF you spend hundreds of dollars.. for a free to play this game is awfully unbalanced and will drive you CRAZY. dont download if you aint willing to spend $$$
4686,"Great game. Arcade style, quick, fast, and exciting battles. Basically World Of Tanks PC but fast and more exciting and without artillery."
4687,"-
"
4688,good graphic and playstyle
4689,"This game and it's absolutely p2w, I have played it since 2017. The RNG is so messud up it is not even possible, the team shuffling is broken and the premium items are really p2w. I hope this will get better, but that would mean that the developers would have to do something and that is not exactly what are they doing. Final review: 2/10"
4690,Love game
4691,Very good game!
4692,Nice game
4693,"Beside the RNG, and some sh#t things, this game is really good, the game mode is really fun like mad games, gravity forces, and uprising. Make me feel addicted to play the game modes, hope it's always available. Last word, I'm really sorry if there any mistake from word."
4694,it is really cool game most games over in 5 minutes or less
4695,Baller game I love it
4696,fun
4697,fun game
4698,"not bad forget the other review 200%
"
4699,"I would not recommend this game. Obvious pay to win and timegating paywalls aside, there is a massive griefing problem. You can get as many kills as you want, hold an objective yourself and your teammates will still AFK, prevent you from moving and leave objectives just seconds away from winning, if there is a slight chance they might get a kill. This blatant throwing has lost me many games and generally feels bad.

Cash grab game, no consequences for constant griefing, need I say more?"
4700,nice semi-fast paced tank battle. uses less resources
4701,"the short enjoyable tank game youve been looking for
"
4702,"good game butttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt it 


PAY 2 WIN........


IMPRESSIVE"
4703,This is good game
4704,"pay to win
"
4705,very biased indeed
4706,"Played since it came out in 2014 and have likely logged in more than 3k hours off steam. Like most games, it's fun until it isn't. Once you start looking at your stats, it really just starts going downhill. If you want to play a game that's based on tanks and can run on an easy bake oven, this game is worth a shot. But for the sake of your own sanity, play a different game."
4707,very fun game if u love tanks
4708,"easy flow of control, decent graphics, partial controller support, xbox wired controller (including 3rd party) runs just fine with ease smooth operation, makes the game much easier to play than a mouse and keyboard alone."
4709,The connection issue over 50 times now that im getting killed on in MAP LOADING

4711,"Engaging, pov game play, enticing and attainable leveling structure."
4712,"Клоуны, сами играйте, неравномерно подбирает игроков. Надоело с афк и раками играть."
4713,This game is the best...
4714,meh its pay to win as all hell but its fun
4715,This is my favorite game.
4716,"this game is trash, p2w factor is there huge, low tier is full of annihilators,smashers and non-existing tanks. WG support is full of uneducated people, ping spikes because low end servers,ghostshells... 
as a player in this game, I spent a thousand hours on steam, several thousand on my phone and a few hundred hours at the Microsoft store.If you want to play the game, get ready for stupid teammates, lags and rngs who may not always be on your side"
4717,"The game is good, if not unbalanced. It's honestly the typical free to play, but actually pay to win mobile game, if that's your thing you can have fun with this game. The reason why I don't recommend it is the match making, it isn't stat based, so you could be a player with a high win rate and understand the mechanics of the game, but you could be paired with players who just bought a high tier tank and don't know how to play it. Basically noob match making can really hamper your experience with the game and while I enjoy it I don't really suggest playing the game unless you are prepared to deal with that."
4718,It is good game but sometimes you go so bead angry
4719,Very Good Games
4720,GOOD GAME
4721,"Although not as expansive as World of Tanks, it upholds the key concepts of the game very well and has become its own independent game due to the differences. The strategies also vary from game to game making the game more unique compared to its original.
"
4722,It's amazing
4723,"Even though I have a War Thunder and World of Tanks account, I like to play this one a lot. I can even play it on my phone or Switch in bed using the same account. It has some fun nonsense tanks (Warhammer, Valkyria Chronicles, some OCs), arcadey and fast-paced battles, and a lot of very rude people. It doesn't even make me angry, sometimes."
4724,"DL'd this during a maint. window of my 'usual' gaming day as a ""Yea, maybe this will be OK"". Been a blast so far (literal pun intended)."
4725,"to manny updates
"
4726,easy to understand and lots of fun....straight forward tank game
4727,no ray tracing bad game
4728,"This is a wargaming's game with it's long history of it's reputation, i know it, you know it, we all know it, that even if the game could of been a fun experience, had potential and most importantly can be improved over time, it still have it's own flaws just like it's predecessors and probably will pass down to it's descendants. There's nothing that i am going to say that you haven't already known, it was a fun one night stand, now i move on."
4729,"THE OVER ALL GAME PLAY IS PRETTY GOOD. GRAPHICS COULD BE BETTER AND MORE REALISTIC, LEVELING UP ISNT BAD AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF TANKS TO CHOOSE FROM."
4730,"An incredible game that gives the adrenaline rush and a good distraction from everyday routine.
Action game, less violence, this is the game to go play with my nephews."
4731,"if you wanna learn about tanks and to always play to rngesus, this game is for you"
4732,tonk
4733,"You""ll fly through your first tanks until you hit tier 6-7, then it becomes a grind. HOWEVER that's when it gets good. You'll become better at the game, it's more competitive and you have more of a variety of tanks to play with. It's addicting and I recommend playing in platoons with friends. Problems: there are some broken tanks like the Annihilator that make the game kind of pay to win. Plus there are way too many crates that are over priced and low key a scam so i recommend not wasting money. Still overall a fun free to play game"
4734,"This game is a real blast to the past for me. I used to play it all the time on my phone, and upon finding it on Steam, I had to get it. It's not even fun because of the nostalgia, it's just pure genuine excitement. Battles are quick but tense and filled with action, join times are short, it's super rewarding and generous, and it's pretty laid back. If you're looking for something less serious that WoT and way more fun, get this game!

And if you say it's bad because of the graphics I swear..."
4735,Great game and very real.
4736,because its the best tanks game
4737,This is one of the most terrible game I had been playing. The program obviously had errors and the control was sluggish. I never had this problem with other similar games. Try to avoid this game at all cost.  There are plenty of alternatives!
4738,The game is full if transactions and bad matchmaking. I regret spending time playing this game instead of doing something productive or something I actually enjoy.
4739,there is no artillery .....my fav.  sad
4740,nice game to pass the time and fun at low level and gets more challenging at higher levels for me anyway
4741,good game but still unstable
4742,wot is better
4743,I like driving tanks and shooting other tanks. This game allows me to do that without the idiocy of artillery and stupid map design you might find in regular WoT.
4744,good game
4745,"tis a good game
"
4746,"Its a fine game but i do not recommend being free to play, you will struggle a ton to keep up with the premium/collector tanks. And wargaming is conituesly asking you to putt 45 bucks in gold to buy one tank"
4747,very goed tonk gaem je dobk will hav foen
4748,Buy at least 1 prem
4749,nice
4750,very gud game 6/9
4751,fast and enjoying
4752,NICE :)
4753,"trash matching algorithm
the game match up by tiers only regardless win rate and stat.
it gets even worse when you platoon with your fd
4x% win rate platoon match up against 6x% win rate platoon
how the hell can new players survive or have fun in this unfair matching game?????"
4754,its very nice game ever i seen
4755,"This game was really good, but know that is botted and it also removed all my tanks. I would still play this game daily though."
4756,good game
4757,if you love tanks.... you're gonna love this game ;>
4758,pfffffffff
4759,"Nice game, highly recommended by me👍👍"
4760,"this is prefect game for perfect gamer,s . i have played this game for 4 years ."
4761,"P2W if u get tier 6 above , bunch of afk player no reason  n broke finding match"
4762,666
4763,Alot more forgiving than its higher end counterparts.
4764,Smasher is the problem.
4765,"RIGGED PIECE OF FUCKSHIT!!!

I LOST 6 MATCHES IN A ROW!!!! THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN!!!!"
4766,It's better than the actual PC version. No joke. The matches are smaller and quicker (less waiting and faster progression) Graphics are great and the UI is adapted for PC.
4767,Its okay but getting money is hard (for me at least) you have to pay a bit to progress unlike in world of tanks where you get money quickly
4768,"It/s a very fun, game with tons of awesome tanks from all around the world.... you can be a casual or hardcore player, and this game will fill ur needs...."
4769,is a good game not to bad
4770,"nice

4771,An awesome game
4772,cannot start on ubuntu
4773,"good game bro'
"
4774,One of the best games of all times. I also play this game on my phone so that I am always around my favorite game. I would argue that World of Tanks Blitz is better than the console version of this game.
4775,very good!
4776,mircotransactions and crates >:(
4777,the free part is worth it
4778,horrible matchmaking.
4779,Grew up with this game. Great fun if you are into machinery and warfare!
4780,like
4781,"good
"
4782,Yes
4783,Dont buy is7.
4784,"This is pretty fun. Yes, there are lootboxes and other monetization schemes, but this game is not trying to hide it + you can easily play like a scrub... err for free."
4785,since world of tanks is finally out we can put blitz to rest
4786,nice game nice tank
4787,"Game is good but every week they do upgrade downloads which cut into playing time .  Expect to wait around a lot for the upgrade to load.  The upgrades are primarily to sell you more stuff and have nothing to do with game improvement.   Pure capitalism, where customers are second to the all mighty green back
"
4788,"Wargaming completly ruined this game, they added pay to win tanks that you cant do anything about except die. The teammates you get are 8yo who still suck on their moms tits for breakfast and DONT KNOW HOW TO HELP YOU OR HOW TO PLAY THE GAME, this game fucking sucks now. Uninstalling"
4789,"Who doesn't like blowing stuff up lol, the game is in a arcade style format that allows you to build your tank skills as you level up not only with the crews to man the tanks but the tank trees allow you different era of tanks to promote yourself up to. Enjoy!"
4790,"its good
"
4791,"Fast paced. Quick to join, unless you are playing with another person. Very competitive."
4792,Its OK its mostly pay to win but if you like quick tank games then this is indeed a game to spend time with.
4793,Lotsa Greind
4794,I hate Wargaming's games.
4795,"This is like world of tanks, but smol."
4796,The game is fun.
4797,"Imo is think this game is better than the normal version of wot in multiple ways, i.e. the fast combat, the lack of arty and various other reasons. i just think that there should be a graphics update as the textures are quite lacking"
4798,love this game
4799,I am addicted.
4800,.
4801,Simple but great!
4802,"""Zero penetration"". This basically sums this game. Combat mechanics is rigged to 50%, btw!"
4803,I like it more due to friends with low pc:)
4804,tanks go kaboom.
4805,"I have been a long time player of this game on mobile (almost six years now). All I can say is that the game is decent, it is mostly fun. However, it suffers from many problems, namely when it comes to player quality. In other words, there are mostly noobs in the game, and if someone downloads it, they will most likely fall into that category. The game does not teach you properly about how to be a good teammate and in order to be considered as a ""good"" player, you would need to dedicate quite a lot of time to researching game tactics. Additionally, I strongly disagree with how the game is monetised, as it is way too easy for a new player to get access to high-level vehicles, which severely affects the game's balance in the higher tiers (tiers 8 to 10).

However, this game is not all bad. The developers have continued to update the game after 7 years, changing how different vehicles perform, adding new countries to the game, new maps, and graphical changes. The game has a lot of variety, with over 400 tanks to play with. It will take a LONG time to get all of the vehicles in the game. After six years of playing, I've only completed four vehicle lines.

If any new players out there are looking to get better in World of Tanks Blitz, I am happy to help people out. If you want any ""training"" sessions with me or advice, my user name is The_Canadian_Sniper_V2, and I play on the NA server. Feel free to DM me."
4806,"Played the mobile version first, and i was quite surprised that they have a PC Version. Though i doubted it first, its actually really playable on my crappy-ass Laptop. Control needs quite a bit of getting used to, especially if you're migrating from mobile but overall a really great version of the game. A good alternatives for those under-equipped for the real WoT or just have a very small phone screen. Also, i can use the same account on both device so that's already a plus."
4807,great game
4808,"As stated by one of my acquaintances, game bad i go to bed lol"
4809,fun
4810,"nice but work hard
"
4811,"Quick, enjoyable way to waste time. Gets grindy at times but overall a good experience."
4812,very nice
4813,"Very very nice game. Easy to get into. Just be patient until you get a Tier 6 tank, and everything will be unlocked so you get the wonderful 7 v 7 experience. I would recomend WoT, and WoTB, as they are both wonderful games (been playing both since i was younger and they just came out) and I've loved them ever since they released. Sometimes it can be slightly pay to win, but with some skill you can turn those tides quickly."
4814,Fast moving game and Great graphics
4815,"if you like tanks
i would recommend this game
it is fast, realistic and fun

4816,kill me already
4817,what you know about rollin down in the deep
4818,"its really one hella of a game 
i remember i used to play it when i was a kid inn my dad's phone i didnt play it that much but i had several accounts it was really on good game unluckily i lost most of my accounts on it (i still have the account that was regitred on my dad's phone as it was connected to his facebook)
this really made a lot of hidden and good memories pop back up"
4819,Good game
4820,"A pretty good concept but terrible execution that isn't helped by the developers. A very toxic playerbase that will rage over anything, pay to win fantasy tanks that can only be obtained by purchasing WarGambling's luck-based containers, countless ingame purchases that you will constantly buy, putting you into crippling debt, as well as a multitude of other problems. Give it a go if you want, it's free to play so you have nothing to lose, and it works as a game to pick up and play every once in a while. But chances are, it will leave you feeling more frustrated and miserable than entertained and satisfied."

4822,A good game. but sometimes boring.

4827,"this game is only about microtransactions. they dont work to bring a better game, they only work for greed. the devs will ban you for speaking out or using gifs. i do not recommend this game."
4828,"Its a cool game. Id rather show this to a beginner than the normal wot. I played normal WOT for 8 years and this thing is very good. Its a simpler version than wot, and no more arties :D"
4829,"The game has no colorblind mode which makes it unplayable for colorblind players like me. The game goes for red-green color coding for friend enemy, with none of the practices that you could implement to attenuate the issue (you could change the hue of one of the color bars to blue easily enough as a temp solution if you wanted to). Supposedly colorblind mode is coming. I may change the review if it ever arrives, yet this is just bad design."

4852,i love it even my cousin cause its fun
4853,"What can I say, the gameplay is rather interesting, it requires good skills, challenging and fairly fun. Cash shop is annoying but not tottaly p2w, you can get decent results even without spending much, at least in random battles. The problem is, amount of content is lacking, I played only 36 hours and I already getting bored with this game, there is not much difference in battles, maps are small, viable tactics for each of them is limited, the game lacks complexity needed for good replayability. All in all, WoT Blitz is OK for a mobile game, but it's not something you want to sink many hours on PC."
4854,GOOD GAME

4857,Not balance tier and type in a single match
4858,to many cheaters and mods and the game loves giving you the middle finger
4859,this is a good game but wg can i habe another premium tank for free plzzzzz i really need that
4860,Good game but RNG its defining factor of this game
4861,ye idk its cool until you get your fade run by some premium idiot with a $50 tank
4862,pog
4863,This game is addictive but the player base is more toxic and negative than any community I've ever seen. The abuse kids hurl at people in this game is really really nasty.

4870,"I remember when this game was enjoyable. Back when there were only a  couple dozen vehicles. But now, 5 years later, there are so many fantasy nonsense tanks that are super annoying to fight against. Not to mention the storm of busted pay-to-win tanks and the culling of free vehicles a couple years back, which its only purpose was to take said free vehicles and sell them for real money. This game has lost its charm, is becoming less and less fun to play and the atmosphere is toxic. It's definitely better than the other versions of this game on console and PC, but it's still there. All in all, if you want to give this game a try, go for it, but try not to spend too much time here like I made the mistake of doing."
4871,It's a fun game with a lot of cool tanks to play but blitz is pay to win
4872,I Think Dad would have liked it. I feel like I am in WWII.
4873,"Leaving aside the fact that the team balancing mechanism is broken fact that affects your winning rate (whether you are an advanced player or not), the game is an addictive one worth playing just for fun.
If the fun turns into a desire to advance and maintain a higher winning rate to prove by statistics that you are a good player, this game is no longer the best choice. In this game the fair play concept doesn't exists.
But as long as you can keep the sense that this game is a virtual reality that has nothing to do with your real life skills, the game can keep its captivating and sometimes even satisfying character."
4874,Too many noobs playing this game...
4875,"World of tanks Blitz is better than World of tanks PC

More balance march making.
Get a tier 10 tank faster.
Not a pay to win game.
A lot of fun modes"
4876,"Bad game and not recomended to play, if you have ""World of Tanks"". -10/10"
4877,Better WoT
4878,"Why I got a feeling that everywhere I go, I always run into a bunch of enemies. It seems the AI knows where I am and ordered to chase player first rather than freely move. I felt cheated.
Try to play again, and still I don't like it. 
Sometimes there is, maybe bot, that do nothing, just sitting there. Every time this happened, my team lost the battle."
4879,"i will compare this to the complete World of Tanks (WoT) game.

Pros:
7-player teams results in fast games, each round ends in a few minutes.
No SPGs, no disturbance of long range arty unlike WoT
Easy enemies, fun time playing instead of WoT where there are many pros and gold round spammers
Easy tank customization, camos, consumables, and gear are easy to select unlike WoT
Japanese Tank Destroyer line is available here and not in the original WoT game

Cons:
Bots can be seen in low tier and between a few games
Researching a module instantly equips it, where sometimes I don't want to use the researched module.
Graphics, physics, and sound are obviously much better in the original game.

TLDR; 
If you want high customization and complex competitive gameplay, go for World of Tanks.
If you want easy gameplay and a fun time, go for this instead"
4880,Fucking pay to win shit. don't bother if u can't afford premium

4886,playing this game feels like i was young
4887,"Good game. Good maps and tank graphics. Tho, I would kindly suggest you to add artillery and a larger map so we can use them. It would be very helpful. Match making can also be better if you guys can modify it.

I too suggest to add tanks that are free to obtain without having to wait a month or so to get one. It would be very nice if there were a log-in schedule on where you can get prizes and one of those prizes would be a free collector tank or a premium tank. 

Overall, its good tank game. Just the subscriptions and the pricing needs to be modified."
4888,A lot of bugs.
4889,nice ass

IMO: absolutely WotB are like an AB (if you ever play WT)

but WotB are still fun game, simple mechanism (doesn't complex like an WT), what different? 

-suck your primary secondary armament
-doesn't engine control system for turn on/off 
-more than took quick time for in game (5-10 min) & you has been done your match

- NEVER SUFFER like an WT player

Loot chests and limited time offer tanks that can ignore regular tanks. This WOT franchise is dead now in mobile, console And in PC becuase of these Freemium p2W tanks. game is very VERY stressful too with toxic community. almost as bad as EVE Online or LoL"

If they simplified the currency packages I might spend some cash on them."
4932,I really hope this game get more tanks if not its fine
4933,probably the best game for free
4934,fun
4935,"I have been playing this game since before it was even available on Steam (2014 when it was still mobile only) and I have watched it change a lot over the years; I'm sorry to say that this change was largely for the worst. I have been playing this game a LONG time and I have become very acquainted with the mechanics and support team. Which, on a positive note I would like to add that the support team is very efficient. 

I would like to preface my statement by saying that this is in no way a military simulator game, it is an arcade game. The armor, speed, and gun calibers used on the vehicles shown are frequently unrealistic and they are seldom true to real-life information, but rather simply adjusted to make the game 'balanced'. DO NOT go for this game if you want a military simulator, this is a tank arcade game. I think of this game as the CS-GO of tank games, which you will come to see as a fitting analogy if you are familiar with the games. If you are looking for a military vehicle simulator I recommend you play War Thunder instead. However, if you simply want a 'no respawns' team based arcade-like shooter game with advanced mechanics and concepts, then this is perfect for you. Think a 3D version of the TankWars Flash Player game. 

I am giving this this game a negative review because in recent years this game has gotten way too 'pay to win' or P2W as some youtubers will denote it. If you have $500 to throw away then this is the perfect game for you. I am completely serious when I say you will need to spend at least $100 to have fun with this game (tier VII or higher) as it currently stands. Money is used to purchase 'premium' or 'collector' tanks which earn more in game currency than the 'free' vehicles, however they do almost nothing to aid you in progressing up the research tree. The real killer for progression in this game isn't how much you have to work to grind up the tech tree, it's how much you have to work to grind to research the best modifications to make you 'free' tank actually playable. This is all the more paramount when you consider that you will have to play in your 'free' tank against 'premium' tanks that are certifiably over powered. I am completely serious when I say ""certifiably [OP]"". I implore you to look up the opinions of players with regard to the ""Smasher"" and ""Annihilator"" tanks. With regard to these abominations, I wrote and sent a two page report to Wargaming detailing how messed up these abominations, called 'tanks', are. There response? ""We believe these vehicles do not imbalance gameplay."" Don't believe there broken tanks? Play the game. Or, even better, play them yourself if you are fortunate enough to. 

I hope you love GAMBLING with REAL MONEY. Whenever Wargaming releases a new tank, it always comes in the forms of crates. Frequently such crates have 5% drop chances with no guarantee you will get the tank. Mind you, these crates regularly cost at least $5.00 or more per crate. Also, that OP tank afore mentioned, the 'Smasher', it was most recently available with crates that had a 5% drop chance and no guarantee of getting the tank. 

Ultimately, this was a game I once truly enjoyed, however it has greatly fallen over the years and it just isn't the same anymore. Trust me, there is just better stuff to play out there; it isn't worth the time or the inevitable disappointment. 

For context on this review, I am not some ""aggro'd noob"". I have completely researched the American, German and British tech trees. I have 20 tier VIII premium tanks, 3 tier X premium tanks, 3 tier IX premium tanks and 15 tier VII premium tanks plus dozens of others at lower tiers."

4937,Good game BUT dota 2 is better
4938,"This game is a payytowin trash. Everybody should keep distance from this game. There are a lot more freetoplay games with less paytowin mechanics. The community is very toxic, developers communicate like idiots and often say bullshits. The game is full of lootboxes with exclusive items. Premium tanks are dominating the tournaments.
I am done with this trash. I have 666 hours. That was totally enough."

4943,yes
4944,"i dont like premium tanks they're coarse, rough and they get everywhere"
4945,"fun game. although being new to it, i do not have the gripes the others would have"
4946,"yes
"
4947,"Basically World of Tanks lite.
It's mostly the same game, with the same roster of tanks and overall gameplay mechanics, but a few things toned down to be more ""noob friendly"".
There's no more friendly fire, you don't brake your tracks going down/off steep hills, and they've changed consumables quite a bit. Also matches are only 7v7. Each person needs to decide for themselves if they prefer the more ""hardcore"" style of WoT or the more laid back style of WoTB, but given that the core game is basically unchanged that makes this a must try game!

As far as legitimate negatives/criticisms I only have 2:
1. This game doesn't scale UI up for 4k (At all. Period. End of story. Unless there's a mod for it and who knows if it's still compatible after any patches.). It's 2021, and there's even cellphones and tablets that are above 1080p. If your devs aren't designing your game to be UHD ready then wtf are you paying them for????
2. The community is quite a bit smaller so queue times for some tiers can be pretty long at times. Smaller matches help to mitigate this for the most part, but doesn't fully resolve it."
4948,yes

this is just a joke."
4953,Very fun free game but would like to be able to play with more then only one friend
4954,the game is good but but in can invite only one to play with you i want to play with two of myfriend and i want more tank it in the present world
4955,"As a 8+ year wot player, and a similar time in war thunder, i thought this wold be too simple to be fun.  first impressions were the combat was too easy... but then again I am playing with other players who just started.  

When it started to shine was as I played 10 games or so, the system to progress was just a joy.  simple but not boring, and rewarding enough to keep me clicking play.  Just a wonderful combination of some no-stress gameplay and a slick progression system.  It accomplished what it aimed to do, and very few games can make that claim."

4981,"I do not suggest you play this game. It gets so repetitive after a while. On every single map you need to go one way to win. Every tank gets boring after a while. You either get the greatest team in the world or people who die 2 minutes into the game. You will never be satisfied after playing this game. Switching tanks, going to new tiers, making a new account, nothing changes. You will get hooked but in a bad day. You'll come back to it thinking ""Maybe today will be different"" but today never comes. Do not play the game."

4987,fr
4988,Not skills based whatsoever.
4989,"I strongly do not recommend this game. Play it only if you like to feel bitter and angry at your own will. 
First good side:
- this game is nice to play, the idea is good, it has nice tanks.
Now the bad sides:
- whether you like it or not, your opinion as a player matters to noone on developers side.
- during the day game is full of kids, people with no skills, no idea about the game and full of idiots in general. These people spoil the game, and when I write spoil - I mean it.
- something is wrong with matchmaking. Devs say it is by random, but somehow during the day I get noob teams too often, and opponent always get better team. On your side there are too often  people who don't care at all, and opponent is always quite good organised and wins too often. It changes during night time, and it is only time when you can play the game normally, without getting angry all the time.
- prices of tanks are lower than on WOT PC but still cost a money
- NEVER, I mean NEVER buy surprise crates for gold, unless you are some millionaire's child. These are rip off, and when I say It I mean it. If you hope for a nice tank from these crates - prepare you will have to spend even 300 Euro - can you afford it?

So like I wrote before - strongly not recommended game, and I played about 10.000 battles on it so I know what I write. 
""Free"" games are the worst, as they attract people with no skills and no real will to win."
4990,pro boomery jak dělané
4991,Lovely how u cant even sign in using steam account!
4992,"If I compare it to regular World of Tanks, this game is huge improvement in gameplay because no arty and premium ammo do less damage. However it is still Wagaming so that means garbage monetization and here monetization is even worse than regural World of Tanks as a lot of premium tanks are a lot better than tech tree tanks and some are even hidden behind gambling with loot boxes. You can have bigger inpact here as it is only 7v7 but playing solo is still more frustrating than fun, but not that much as regular WoT.

So do not waste your time or money on any World of Tanks game as it is not worth it."
4993,"easy to play, fun, addictive."
4994,"Very grindy, but a good simulation game for tanks. Also try the real World Of Tanks that's harder but only for the pc. also i'm advertising lol"
4995,"This is a good 5vs5 tank game. what is world of tanks blitz?: world of tanks blitz is a game of 5v5 tank game. here to play you need: dodge attacks, attack, stay together with you team and be the winner team. why game is free? game is free because... is free! i not can say why is free. who age rating can play? ah me recommends 8+ of age because parents need say to kid is only on the game. is not like kill humans but... they are using real bullets! ok. this game is with bots?: yea, i play with players like bots, name of bot and this game need use bots. why. me review is 8.7 out of 10. if you like ok."
4996,Good game
4997,"If you wanna play the game, read this first:
It seems fun when you start, driving tanks, shooting enemies, improving to bigger tanks... But there are major issues about the game:
1) Premium (paid) content: Even though it is free to play, you cannot improve unless you pay money. Premium accounts gain 2x more xp and silver than normal players. That 2x might not seem a lot but believe me, it is. Not only that, premium tanks (only bought with gold) give a lot more silver. In order to progress, you need to have a premium tank, preferrably tier8+, to gain silver, to buy and upgrade tanks.
2) Terrible matchmaking: You will always, ALWAYS get the worst team. This game requires a HUGE AMOUNT of teamplay. You cannot even win 6v7. So you always rely on teammates. And oh boy do you get tilted out of your mind.
3) Grind: You need to grind a lot in order to even have a chance of improving in this game. And when I say a lot, I mean 4-7 hours every day. Even than you do not improve too much. 
4) Balance: There are bunch of broken, unbalanced tanks (annihilator for example) in the game and there are no balance changes.
5) Maps: Although there are many maps, you feel like you play the same maps over and over again. that's because all the maps are the same thing, changed slightly. Almost every maps is the same, they don't have unique things that seperate them from other maps.

In conclusion, If your expectation from a game is to spend about 50 dollars, waste 200 hours to get a decent tank and get tilted every game just to drive some tanks, this is the game for you"
4998,"its nice:D

4999,"Very different from the Desktop WOT version:

Most tanks have more armour and less weak spots, encouraging premium ammo consumption. (Tiger 1 can't pen Tiger 2 anywhere aside from couple from front)

Game requires a lot of in-game money to play at tier 7+  (I deal 2.8k damage average with Tiger 1 and make 5k credits IF we win)

Some VERY unfair premiums (more so then PC version)

Game has very expensive consumables which give advantages like higher DPS (Which is absolutely necessary). You need premium account or else you will lose money (I did 4.7k damage in a tier 7 game, won, and still lost 2k credits)

Mobile users have no sense of awareness and my back hurts carrying my team. (In PC I have a W8 of 51.75%. Here I have 73.25% but I assume that will go to 65%-ish after 1000 more games)

Bots are a good addition to the game but they quickly become annoying after teir 6. If both teams have equal composition of tank types but one has bots on their heavy tanks while the other has bots on light tanks, the latter team wins.

Game controls are weird. If you played WOT PC you will understand. It is definitely not optimised for PCs.

Very bad connection problems. Usually happens during the night.


But there is one thing monumentally more awesome then the PC version: It is less then 4GB. you can download it over the WiFi in 50min and start playing. PC version is more like 40GBs. it is not fun getting that into a laptop without Ethernet cables. So try, play and then uninstall."

5003,"After playing this game for 3.5k hours of my life, I have finally decided to give this game the review it deserves. If you are a newer player and you want to play this game then feel free to do so. However, there are a few things that you need to consider before investing more of your time into it. 

The first part that I want to say is the good things about the game, the part what actually made me continue playing it even to this day even though I play less and not as often as I used to. So with that being said, for newer players, the game is easy to learn and at the same time easy to master once you invest more of your time learning about it. This is because most of the mechanic in the game isn't that complex unless you start being in higher tier where you will need certain knowledge of how to use your tank properly and apply such tactics like side scraping, hull down, face hug,etc. These knowledge can be obtain by watching videos on YouTube or by playing with an experienced friend like I do. The game is without a doubt a fun and simple game as the more you play on it, the more addicting it gets especially if you have a friend that tag along with you. The grind to get to a higher tier tank is also very easy as you can get many rewards from your weekly personal and clan mission crates & free containers. These will eventually ease up your grind as they give you certain amount of credits, credits booster, premium certificate, tank research discounts, etc. Easy to say, they help you progress faster to get up to a higher tech tree. So yeah, the game is not necessarily P2W when it comes to grinding. As a matter of fact, grinding is way more easier now than it is back then. So, that's all of the good points that I can think of. To summarize the pros, its fun and addicting, easy to play,to master and to grind. 

Now, the second part is the interesting bit because for me personally, after playing a huge amount of hours in the game, I can definitely say that the bad is more than the good. Why so? Because while the game is fun and addicting, it can also make you lose your mind. Remember when I say that this game is easy to play and easy to master? Its true BUT! Many people take that for granted as many of them refuses to improve themselves even for the simplest of thing such as shooting and actually hitting your target. It doesn't matter if you have 100k battles or 200k, you will definitely see some people despite the amount of battles they had,are extremely bad at the game. Additionally, I would like to add that while making newer players grind easier seems to be a good thing, it is also is a bad thing since it allows them to gain a higher tier tank without a proper knowledge. For example, if you are a newer player and you get a tier X tank, it would be disastrous as you don't know how to actually use the tank to its full advantages/potential. This is where most of the problem lies where newer players are rushing to grind/buy tier X tech tree/premium without even learning the actual game mechanics. To add more to the salt, you will experience A LOT of toxic players in the game. Its not surprising that an addicting game will get you these types of player and unfortunately, these types of toxicity comes from anyone, from good and bad players alike. Some even worse than other. You think the game do anything to these people? NOPE! No matter how many reports have been given towards a player in terms of unsporting conduct, provocative communication, inactivity in battle,etc,  they will not be ban properly. The most of their concern is probably chat ban which refrains them from talking to others but even then, they can still play the game and repeat the same thing that they do over and over again. Once the chat ban has been lifted, some may continue to be toxic and the cycle repeats. Furthermore, aside from toxicity the game is definitely going towards the P2W direction. Now I know that I said the grind for newer player is easier but after you played a while you will start to realize that most premium tanks are better than the tech tree tank. Tanks like Smasher and Annihilator basically ruin a whole tier because of how ridiculously strong it is and its not even based on a real tank! One is basically an OP KV2 that can have the potential to put a one shot or a massive damage to a tank while its tech tree free KV2 counterpart is nowhere near the same. As for the annihilator, its basically some sort of a mad max tank that can shoot 3 times at once and it is ridiculously strong in both of its armor and reload time. Both of these tanks can be gained IF you spend money in the game. You will also notice that every month, there will be a battle pass that grants you tanks only if you buy the battle pass and these tanks are usually a better version of their free tech tree counterpart. To sum it up, the cons in this game is definitely more than the pros with the game having majority of the players being incompetent and toxic, useless reports system and lastly going towards the P2W direction. 

So do I recommend this game to you? NO! I don't. I have spend a lot less time with this game and the only reason why I'm still playing is because of my friends otherwise this game will drive you insane when you play alone. The game is broken beyond fixing with its system reports being unreliable, poor and toxic players, P2W tanks and unfair matchmaking."

5013,"you'll spend thousands of hours, if not dollars, on WoTB once it hooks you. and it will hook you.

but it will also infuriate you.

pros: everything and then some
cons: everything and then some

lol, for real though. the game is an epic shooter for the competitive ages when it's working flawlessly. but public matchmaking can often leave much to be desired (forcing you to retreat to Ratings games for a taste of that real gameplay), and the game's netcode will have you tearing your hair out when you start recognizing and experiencing the mortal flaws inherit to the game like ghost shells and packet loss-based rubberbanding. there's also some glitches like enemies with 1 hit of life left auto-deflecting your killing blow (acting like a type of Second Wind kind of perk) whether you hit a highly penetrative area such as the lower glacis plate or side 40mm plates -- regardless of your penetration and shell normalization, the shot will bounce 100% of the time and when you're in a tank with a 122mm+ gun and a reload topping out at 10+ seconds or higher, this auto-deflect can mean the difference between victory or certain death and defeat. you'll see what i mean if you play it long enough.

think of this ish like you would CSGO if you've played it enough: the good outweighs the bad and the game is addictive AF, but it will definitely illicit a severe nerdrage response at some point no matter how well you play. i can't put the game down despite its flaws and have sunk nearly every free moment i have on the PC since the lockdown began to Blitz. The original PC version is a good game too but I like Blitz's brevity and its punishing snowball system related to match progress a much more enjoyable and rewarding experience. games are short and sweet and even 1 mistake during the meta phase can sway the course of a battle (which is why people are furious with the matchmaking system; you're at the mercy of morons OFTEN when leveling your account up to Tier 10)"

5023,First tank game i have played and the best one as well.thank you for this game.
5024,"Very fun game, my only complaint though is these anime tanks are very disappointing as Pz. lV Ankou SP only has custom anime voice in the game while the rest has the stock voice, which this set is PAID, I saw some mods that gives all these tanks anime voice, but as a download-and-play person I don't want to move or delete files that I don't know because I might destroy the game itself, and will cause me to delete all files and download everything again which kinda inefficient. Plz read and fix this Wargaming in the future updates, PLZ.

To whom this game for:
-Everyone who have not-so-good pc/laptop but love tank games (if you have better pc I recommend the original world of tanks or world of warships or war thunder)
-Everyone who wants something fast-phase/slow-phase/fighter/leadership/camping/trolling/etc, this game is for you 
Expect someone will be mad at you if you do the last 2 things I said here :D 

GOODLUCK :D"

5124,"before i begin sorry for my terrible spelling and keep in mind that the 500+ hours were before i switched to the steam. im actually registered since 2014 and my WR is 70.53% out of 40k games. 

now where do i begine with. 
lets start with match making. it is none existent. WG likes to say that MM is based on tanks and the people that join are random. i do not understand how you can put 1 person at tier 5 for example and the other 6 are tier 6. that poor tier 5 is just helpless and usless. and there is also a part about the player too... i ones came across a game where i fought againts 6 people above 65% WR whilst my entire team but me, were below or close to 50%.... random? based on tanks? sure... having a game of 7 premium tanks that are WAY TOO OP BTW is comeplety random. 80% of the time u will be low tier in MM unless u are tier 10, that is the highest. 

speaking of premium tanks. this game is a pay to win. how? simple, first of all MOST premium tanks are just way too op for their tier. take the annailator or the smasher for example. the anni needs 2 bursts (its a 3 burst gun) so a total of 6 shots in less then 20 seconds to destroy 97% of any tank below its tier. it is a tier 7 so most tanks at tier 6 are complelty useless against it. sounds fair? then there are a lot more OP tanks like the Lowe, defenders. badger. 121B. the tier 10 premium VK what ever the fk it is. and so on. and the only way to get them is by bying them. 

now lets talk about the trash community that this holds. i sometimes feel like this game is full of 6 year olds. not only about how salty they are, but also about how they just do not think when playing. and that is thanks to the might of P2W. by just buying the premium pass, that is insanly expensive you get a LOAD of good stuff, ranging from credits too boosters too premium tanks. too free xp and gold. i did an exerement of how stupid the system is. i bought the premium pass and only used the resources that it gave me and grinded a random tree to make it fair so that i dont gring an OP tree, chosen by a friend. it took me 287 games from tier 1 to tier 10. considering that a game lasts an average of 4 min. thats just 19 hours of gameplay. and we are talking about a tree i dont like. if i played a tree of my style it would be way faster. so with that a person can easily grind his way up in no time. with having little to none expirience and gl playing with these kind of people. 
and the wors of all is how salty they are and blind. if they just die and start looking at other team mates and see someone on our side across the map casually driving. they wil anleash hell upon that person. even tho that person just stood against 3 people all on his own and got out of conflict, makins his way to help the rest of the team. that guy will be stashed with hate from everyone at that point just caz 1 person said look at him. he is not doing anything. and then begging the enemy team to give him negative feedback AKA millitery honor. that is the most stupid trash i have ever seen. who gives a **** about it is a mystery.

and WG does nothing about it too, ive sent countless tickets about abuse and so on to them and their respone is a CTRL C + CTRL V ""we will look into it"" every single time. 

the game it self. fairly fun. i link anything to do with war machines. the penetration and spotting system... complete horse ****. the grraphics, early 2000s and no improvments since 1.16 all i see is a bunch of bundles, new premium tanks, battle passes and nothing new. no new maps. no fixes. ghost shots are still a thing. 

overall this game will be fun for those who have a daddy with a credit card. or some rich folks. but for an average person who just wants to go in and play is will be annying in about 30 hours time. unless ur the type of person who will have 80K games and 38% WR. gold bless that guys nevs of steel!

this is an edit after the review above:
wanted to add some extra stuff that ive missed or forgot about. 
there is a thing in this game, called ""countdowns"" bassically, 4 or more people, friends will join a discord lobby, take the same tier tank as the rest and they countdown the time when they all click the ""battle"" button at ones. this ends up it a chance to join a lobby together, even without a platoon. and they can do this while in a platoon too. so the end result is you having more then 4 people ( i ones had 6!!!) join the same lobby out of 14 players. just think about it, how fair this is. almost half of players their have the same goal even in opposite teams. they call out locations of other ""random"" players, the troll, grief make fun of people and end it up with a draw for no reason what so ever. some go for a win, others just troll. 
uppon investigation the forums, people are upset that this actually happens. WG response killed everyone, they claim that since they are not ""cheating"" or attempting to use ""hacks"" or ""coding"" this is completly ok and they aproove. 

-.- ???

speaking of them not listening to people, i had countless people like my self, who enjoys playing video game give actualy helpfull advice to WG, 1 of which was as easy as just allow players to see other players who are in your friends list or clan members being busy whilst in a platoon, and have a timer of sorts saying how long they are in the game. i mean... how fkn hard can that 4 line code be??? how hard could it possibably be to make the people who a e in aplatoon be displaied as a yellow color, as in busy. or any other color for that matter!  WG said that that will interfier too much with the game and probably cause a lot of lag.... 
?????? can any programmers here DM me and say if that excuse is actually legit? 
the other idea was to atleast somehow try to balance MM, which we all know is horseshit. we offered the following: in a 14 player game and a tier system of +-1 tier. allow up to 3 higher tier tanks, and 4 lower tier tanks in both tiers equally. and as for the BS that we get 7 premiums wed offered thta there can only be a max of 2 premium tanks per team. this way, lower tiers wont jump into a game where they will have to fight 6 higher tier tanks. and F2P players wont have to deal with all 7 premium tanks on the other side.

its been 2 years. and we yet to get a response. and i dont think we even will get 1. 

and the final idea we asked for and this is an idea that you can easily find in the forums because people are begging for it. is to allow the players on YOUR team too see the ""stats"" of each other in battle. maybe a personal rating bar. or your win rate will be dispplayed next to your name. or something that shows that ""hey, that guy is pritty good."" 
this will hopfully make all the retards with 40% WR who think that they are amazing, actually see who is worth listening to and that way you can make a plan more effectively. make sure not to see the enemies stats so that people wont just hunt the strongets guy in there. 
and surprisengly WG responded. with the complelty fkn garbege system that is called millitery honor. the fkn 5 star rating thing that you can get no joke in a day. and is EASILY earned by people who litirelly have issues. 
obv.... you tell me when was the last time you actually gave a shit about a person with 5 start millitery honor?

i had something els to add, but by typing this in, i forgot. and there is SO much more i can say about this game. iff ill remember, ill post it in."

5126,Tanks are good.

5144,its literally league of legends but good... also it is tanks.....
5145,Pure pay-2-win.Stay away from this money-trap game.I didnt pay any money for any tanks but its impossible to win without pay.Lvl5 tank on charttree vs lvl5 tank premium is not matching as power or armor so it is destroying all fun.If you have too many spare money then go ahead destroy the non-pre tanks and enjoy!

5182,"nooob teammates, stupid graphics and why hould you play ytihs game on pc when you can play it on phone"
5183,NICE GAME
5184,i probably have more than 1000 hours on pc and blitz combined and ive been playing since the release of the pc version. sure the tanks u get from lootboxes r obviously better than tech tree tanks. but the people who buy the crates r usually nubs so git gud. also unfortunately in this game u need to carry your team and stay calm even if your teammates play terrible or you do. It's a hit and miss game and you will hate and love the game at the same time.

Otherwise alot of fun strategically. In the beginning it is rough because you struggle getting ingame credits, and gold but as you get better you come by them much faster.

Edit: 10x easier playing on pc, in comparison to playing on tablet/phone unless you use mouse/keyboard on phone/tablet as well"

5227,"Cant recommend this game If you like losing go ahead but keep in mind you are at the mercy of bad teams and other players much better and richer.After playing a while longer I stand by my recommendation if you are a new player you will be just a target for higher skilled players or richer or have played longer like all MMO,s. And how teams are picked by the match maker makes we wounder if some cheating is at play. Way too many one sidded matchs. So it is very hard to advance unless you spend money and that,s what wargaming seems to be only interested in."

5231,Pay to win bullshit.
5232,"In brief:
Don't ever waste your time and money.

Details:
I have been playing video games for 20+ years including online and multiplayer ones. I have been playing this game for almost over a year actively. Here are my thoughts about this game:
1) Worst matchmaking: teams are not balanced, you will have the worse players in your team most of the time. Worse means really bad, you can't even imagine. Maybe there are not enough players playing this game, I don't know. Anyway, good luck with your nerves!
2) Worst connection: this is the only online game that I keep having connectivity and/or ping issues.
3) One of the most expensive games: this is a pay-to-win game. If you want to win or have fun, you have to pay (a lot). Even after some levels, you can't even keep playing without premium accounts, it's just not possible.
4) Ugly graphics: When I play this game, I feel like I play a game from the early 2000s.
5) Bad sound effects: Most of the time, you will hear the same sound effects for most of the tanks.
6) Luck: luck is a big excuse in this game. If you are lucky, you can win. If you are not lucky like me, then good luck with staying calm!
7) Not improving: No new maps, nothing new. They are not even trying to improve the bad and/or missing things I mentioned above. Sometimes they just add different game modes for a short duration, that's it. Most of the time, they announce new premium tanks that you can pay for and buy them.

As a result, I spent too much time and money on this game. One of the biggest regrets for me in the game world. Most of the time it is just not fun. I wish I spent all that time and money on a better game. There are really good games, try them instead of this one."
5233,"World of Tanks Blitz is an underrated gem amongst many tank games in my opinion. Its larger version, the original WoT is way bigger, has better soundtrack and graphics, and the developers seem to concentrate on it, but I think it's the WoT Blitz that's more fun to play. Your basic rounds are 7v7, and are way shorter than the ones in the original, so a single player has definitely more influence on the outcome of the battle. The fast-paced gameplay also offers another advantage - Lack of place for putting in Artillery tanks, something that most WoT players despise. The game is also decently balanced, with some exceptions. The game is also very generous, giving you tons of free premium time and free experience points. This makes the grind that much easier. It's definitely not realistic, so if you're searching for a realistic tank game search somewhere else. While the game is still heavily influenced by RNG, and some lines are genuinely not worth it, i'd overall recommend this game for people who like tanks and shooter games."
5234,"bad
"
5235,"very bad game, but developers pay me)))"
5236,"Was fun liked it
Got bored a bit
But would recommend playing war thunder then this."
5237,Much easier than pc version..ezy grind quick match..lots of tank will run in any pc or potato laptop
5238,Its Fun nice epic Fun Funny Fun with Friends :) Thx WG for this this is fun well if u want more player i would Add the WW1 tanks back then u might get a lot more players
5239,great russian dad game
5240,its damned good game
5241,"The game was nice several years ago. But WG always managed to find ways to milk people. Selling OP fantasy tanks, selling tanks in crates even the old ones with the crates are last of them. Actually, there are more premium tanks tham the regular ones in the game (Some of them absolutely OP, I have some of the OP tanks by the way)... If you are thinking to start to play that game and also want to enjoy the nice tanks. Get ready to pay lots of money, and spend a lot of your time as well...
 
I never purchased crates, I knew what's gonna happen but today wanted to test it myself (I had about 40k golds sitting in my my inventory :O ). I purchased 22 Scorpion G crates for 17K golds... And what did I get? Some unuseful crap which I have tons of them. That's the part of of the business...

Let me explain the algorith of the crate system. It's like this, WG wants to sell some desired tanks as little as possbible but also wants to maximize the profit. So, they put crates and with let's say 4% drop chance (lol, as in Scorpion crates...). Yes, initial drop chance is 4% percent or so, you are very likely to drop it right after WG put them on shop. But that drop chance decreases according as people drops the tanks. If you open the crates after 10 hours later like me, your drop chance would be very low and you will burn your money for nothing. That system also works to attracts other players (victims?), that is another aspect of the system. For instance, a kid dropped the tank at the third crate or even at the first crate ( as I say initial drop chance is very high or as the exact rate as the advertisement states) and wrote it on the chat, made a YT video and post it on the forums etc. People think oh yeah, why not, I can drop it too. But, that never happens... As a conclusion, the game demands a lot but offers a little. I for one, doesn't play the game that much anymore, play mostly in the events. I have unlocked almost every tank, maxed all of the crew skills, have about 110 premium and collectible tanks etc. But I have been playin the game for years (about 6 years). You don't need to waste best things in your life for this like me. I doesn't worth it. Just think about what you can do in those time (learning new languages, learning coding, new skills and so on and so forth). But, If you are not serious about the game, it is perfectly OK. Go ahead and have fun.

P.S. : I am not blaming them for their being profiteering fat cats. I just wanna say I will always remember losing my money on the gambling when they sell new tanks with crates. Also, please listen my advices young friends, I didn't write them for that crate matter. It's nothing to speak of and well-deserved for me at the same time. :D"
5242,"Game  have  internet  problems  + unbalance  I hit with TD tier 10  from side  with gold ammo   250 damage not once 20 times + sometime you hit  nothing just shell go in sky ... Greedy company  cant fix there servers  problem with ping  + there servers are in America ...
"
5243,"It's not War Thunder or World of Warships, but it works..."
5244,the most bloated microtransction game ever
5245,"Pay to win tanks in loot crates. Matches are not skill balanced. No afk detection. Bad ping in all 3 places I've lived while playing this game.

Additionally, there's just a bunch of fantasy tanks. If you're looking for a real tank game, look elsewhere.

I would give them 4 stars on iOS if they implemented auto afk detection and made ranked matches for all players.

Last, why do I have 300 hours played? Sunk cost fallacy! Don't be an idiot like me!"
5246,"if you racist clap your (What The Fuck)?
"
5247,Fun tanks

5256,"awesome game
"
5257,"alright alright they made improvements so im changing this to recommended 

the only thing that makes me mad is the fact that people with heavy tanks who are supposed to be at the front absorbing enemy fire likes to stay at the back while the tank destroyers who are supposed to be at the back goes to the front and ofcourse, dies."
5258,"Hadnt played for a while.
my account has vanished. cannot log in with steam.

walking away."
5259,I think most of the player that play World of tanks should be playing this game instead.  So many really bad players.
5260,pog
5261,this game sucks because it is so unfair to other players depending on your win ratio is how they determine  the games for you total bullshit.
5262,"This game is really fun, almost as fun as war thunder, Tho the main WOT game has lots of toxic people, but blitz is fine. and The main WOT is really hard to learn and im still not even good at it, All though blitz is easy to learn, hard to master, i have not even mastered this game yet but its still really fun, I recommend this game to big tank fans like me."

5265,tanks
5266,must try....!!!!!!!!!!!!
5267,great game
5268,"Good game for players, who like tank games or for those, who have a low end PC. :)"
5269,"Short review: P2W

If you wondering if you were actually that good, or your teammate sucks, even perhaps the enemies are noobs... actually, after tutorial you will be matched with BOTS. Leveling up from tier 1 until tier 4 was easy. It takes less than 6 hours to reached tier 4 tanks. However to unlock tier 5 (roman: V) requires you to have  10.5K match points and 400K in-game (free) coins which takes hours especially if you're teamed with noobs or you can also pay with real money. Upon unlocking tier 5, should you feel satisfied? Like, yay, finally!? No! HAHAH. ""Upgrades"" started at 5K, ""Equipment"" will be 40K each. Armor piercing ammo cost 2.4K each but you can pay with real money too. Do the math, unless you're lucky enough to team up with pros, have fun grinding for ridiculous hours or have some money to properly enjoy the game and winning. One last note, don't bother to grind match points with previous tanks since the points will be useless and won't be brought onto next tier's tanks. I spent 11 hours to see if everything beyond tier 4 would be good. Nah, delete this garbage."
5270,.
5271,"90% of your and enemy team are bots LOL

(literally get shot at and don't react)"
5272,"Very nice version of the game, not like the original one, but still very well made. The games last <5 minutes"
5273,swearing to dev simulator
5274,"So Great but the matching so unfair.. even u profesional play this game but other players in ur team, play many times, still cant play well... Tired to give them instructions to be more good but theu not care... Hope this DEV do something about matching, means matching due the performance and not on tier tank... have alots good player our there but kind of player that dont care about winning, is not fun anymore."
5275,World of Tanks' mobile spin-off title. Slightly more generous economy and casual friendly mechanics than PC WoT. Sealclubbing people playing on phone is fun don't judge me.
5276,Great Game!!!
5277,"The game itself is great, apart from it being pay to win. Just about everything wants you to spend money on, still better than EA games I guess. Gameplay's amazing, but it will take such a long time to get high tier tanks without spending money on it."
5278,i like tanks
5279,"Great game that is quick and very enjoyable to play. Also a very good way to pass the time :)
"
5280,play it you will rage alot but its fun

"
5282,"if your reading this you have steam, if you have steam get some none mobile game, pls, this game will eat your soul.  I love this game but they have ruined it..."
5283,Honestly if I don't know what to play I load up this game... Its not pay to win (Although money will help) and just been enjoyable for these 55 hours I've clocked so far...
5284,toxicity all around the world lol
5285, Tried again after a few years and its still pay to win cr*p... get your money out if you want to play.
5286,GOOD GAME
5287,so good

5317,hell of a game good fun plus good way to make friends
5318,"Game is painfully hard to gain experience. Double gunned vehicle's guns do not work. Premium vehicles are overpriced but the game is not pay to win. Game modes are fun a lot of times, it is a mobile game too. I like this game and I hope the REAL World Of tanks comes to PC soon."

Obviously You can buy EVERYTHING. Worst example of pay to win. Fat wallet = win."
5338,This is whack. Don't understand how this has so many good reviews when the main menu doesn't even work. I think there should be more to the game than 3/4 menu tabs that work.

-goods
Overall game design,mechanics and gameplay are good.Grind is 'okay'..
Game can be really 'fun' but it's less than like 20%.

-bads
THE WORST ''match making'' system i have ever been part of.No matter how good you are if the game says you lose,you lose.It's so broken to the limit it's just a joke and everyone knows it and no one CARES! What i think is based on is tanks and not the actual players 'rank,stats,win/rate' etc..

GREEDY company 'WG' that is just looking to squeeze the money mostly from children.Allmost all the 'good stuff' in events and so on are money based.The thing is kids(and other players) keep buying stuff so they keep doing this. *You can buy a new game on steam or several new games for the money they ask for,for some premium tank/s,gold etc... like W T F PEOPLE!?.*

GAME BALANCE? Premium,collectable vehicles that you need gold or real money for are unbalanced and op.But not all,also there are some free tech tree tanks that are also op so overall balance is bad.
Althoug game balance is bad i would rather have ''WORKING'' matchmaking and op tanks then vice-versa. Current state is that both systems are broken sooo...

THE GAME HAS NO END,no goal.What do i mean?
 Well , everything is based on grind and buying ,unlocking the new tanks.Usually most events,also ''battlepasses' are oriented around getting some boosters and a 'new tank' which is all just a mask to grab more money. But there is no like long term goals that u can achive or something to play for ,to create ,something to build to be excited for. It's all about endless grind to get more stupid tanks which is disappointing.

CONCLUSION
If you want to play a game that will 70% of the time make you angry and be pissed or you have a loads of money to spent ,cause why note? Then go for it. 
Unless they fix these issues i'll recommend you to stay away .. There are tons of games out there that are WAY,WAY more enjoyable and fun than this.

I hope this helps. :)"

One of the best non Stress Free game."

I would recommend it to anyone who likes satisfying progression and action"

Either die first, every match as the lowest tier tank, or pay. 
Either suffer, getting no where, or pay. 

I have no idea how anyone plays this seriously, when War Thunder exists. Yes. I said it. 

This game is pure nonsense"

5401,"The experience is amazing!Being able to use a tank to destroy other tanks,just creates a feeling of joy.The game is good and detailed.The only down side would be when you fight alone (enter a match with other players you don't know) you might lose because nobody or at least most of the players don't want to cooperate with you;but the game remains good and enjoyable in every aspect."
5402,Just play.
5403,boring
5404,"Let's cut to the chase
I'd say 86 out of 100. [8.6/10]
Good sides:
- Great game, cross platform means you will be playing with and against players from Microsoft Store, Android Smartphone's Google Play Store and other similar platforms where WoTB is available.
- Uses Steam account so, if you wish to switch to Microsoft store's one, you can but you won't be able to use the same progress from this one. I tried and failed. The games are the exact same one. BUT Runs good on both places.
- I like events.
- I like how minimalist it is. The option to chose Standard graphics to HD graphics is one of the best of this game. I wish the low system requirement play-ability remains so that many more could enjoy. Because in games such as this, I feel, (in my opinion) graphics barely matter. Hope they keep the play-ability that way making more people able to enjoy this game.
- Servers are far far far better than the normal PC version of World of Tanks (non-Blitz), because I had to stop playing it because the game was heavy and there was no Singapore server (used to be, they removed it). Where as here sometimes I get good ping of 60MS if my ISP is doing it's job properly.

Bad sides:
- I don't like too much notification and feeds.
- Some do complain that this is ""pay to play"" type games and I have literally played with people who said so with in game matches.
- I'd have liked if the text conversations in game didn't disappear. I believe it wouldn't harm them if they kept 6 months/1 year of text data. It's not like everyone is texting their thesis/research papers and discussing them in chat here.
- Sometimes it does feel a bit unbalanced because you sometimes get very bad teams in a row where all or almost all of your team is bad where the enemy is very good and the opposite too happens when my team is all good but the enemy is too weak that they are easily beaten and this is something that can minimize the fun you can have playing this game."
5405,"good
"
5406,"If you are looking for a replica of world of war tanks, then this game is for you. The game offers you a wide variety of tanks to play and then later on in the game customize into your chosen tank into a ruthless machine. Moreover, the game has a lot of operation that you can play with friends, for example, Operation Red Planet. However the game was intended to play on mobile rather than on PC, therefore I found it challenging to play this game. Additionally, the game looks and feels exactly like War of world tanks except for different skins/ missions and a bit different gameplay.👎"
5407,mmjm
5408,This game is one of my favorite games i like the graphics and the gameplay.

5412,"Developer greed: the game

Gambing for children through cash only loot boxes - you got it.
Game breaking tanks - sure thing chief, have fun playing tier 6-7-8 against smasher and annihilator platoons.
Every new tank that gets added is overpowered, seal clubs the living shit out of the game and then gets nerfed a patch later. It's almost like they are incapable of understanding that out of the armor-mobility-firepower trifecta, adding a tank that checks all 3 will break the game.

The sad thing is that this could be a great game."
5413,I got this game just so I can get skins for girl und panzer also because my freand recommended it to me. all I'm here to say is HOW DO I GET THE GUP SKINS that is all plz give me a head and tell me how and no I'm not going to get a mod. that is all glory to altotzka

Tier 6 + it starts getting grindy a lot, and you have to make choices on what to upgrade etc. All in all good game to play for 2 months or so"
5429,"Not a very good game, it plays well, the match making needs some work and balancing needs to be done. Some tanks need to be nerft or have something done to them to make game fun and other tanks need to be buffed. Finally lose your pride and listen to your players just like you did with missiles!"

5441,"I have been playing this game for more than 5 Years now with a WR of 57%. This game was kinda my childhood, and I loved it.

[h1] But [/h1]

What has become of the game can be recognized as a joke. 2 years ago it was still playable for someone who never wanted to spend money. Nowadays you can only hope that you don't fight against overpowered vehicles. It's not fair that normal vehicles are 10% worse than premium vehicles. 

And about matchmaking: I don't know how people exist who after 6 years of playing still don't get how to play it! 90% of the games I lose only because my team makes some shit, do not act like a team and then insult at the end how shit we are. 

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

Yes the game is a good introduction to the real World of Tanks, but there is nothing more to say. Graphics are quite good for a mobile game. I would see it as a starter game for World of Tanks, more than 500 std you can not stand it.

Just enjoy and make sure most of your shots count and always aim to get high damage. The more damage to  the enemy the bigger your chances of winning!

GOOD LUCK! ! !"

Its very painful at first but it gets better as you progress throught the tech tree.

As a long time FPS game player, this is really a very nice breath of fresh air. This game has a very complex damage model, there is some kind of physics model of how the cannon shells hit the armor of a tank, not only does armor thickness matter, but also how it's angled towards incoming rounds also play an important part, on top of that armor piercing and high explosive shell types have different effects on different part of the target. You can probably write an academic paper on how the gameplay mechanic works for World of Tanks Blitz.

Sure this game can sometimes be a little pay to win, but if this is really your cup of tea, you can still have fun even if you lose."

5494,"typical pay to win game with fun elements and not so good game matching.
as beginer you fight against  experienced players?

Pure pay-2-win.Stay away from this money-trap game. When you donot pay money for tanks its will be impossible to win and hard to maintain high level tanks (above lvl5).

Lvl5 tank on charttree vs lvl5 tank premium is not matching as power or armor so it is destroying all fun. You need gold to buy the best ammo to one-shot kill the enemy

If you have too many spare money then go ahead destroy the non-pre tanks and enjoy!"
5495,"Absolutely horrific. I've been playing war thunder for over a few years and a friend recommended this. It took over 10 shots to kill one tank. All of the crew in the enemy tank should have died, but no, crew is not modelled."

In addition, you will be thrown to death with advertising to take premium tanks stuff account etc. You really have to close screens 4 to 5 times before you can continue very iritant.
world of tanks is 100x better while the same makers are. the only thing the same is that they both want your money player is not that important with this maker."

5506,"This is a more lame version of World of Tanks (WoT). The graphics are greatly reduced to accommodate the Switch and other consoles. The UI has been simplified. The upgrade system has been simplified too much IMO and there appears to be no historical info on the tanks. The upsells are way up in your face. IMO, if you are a PC player, then you would be better off playing WoT."

5529,"People say it's Pay to Win.
I say: ""If you understand how tanks work and how the game mechanics work, it's actually quite easy. Depends if you have a good team or not.""
But honestly, try this game out. Try to get a friend who has experience in this game, get up to at least tier 6-7, and feel acompilished about yourself playing this RNG game.
I feel satisfied with my Tiger 1. I played this since i was a lil' kid. +rep
PS: It will be a pain in the ass at the start, and the Matilda is a beast.

Update: Buying premium tanks is for credits, not being op. I can confirm as i have bought a few a day or two ago."

5556,"I'd give Blitz 3 of 5 Stars.  It just isn't as polished as the Blitz's big brother, WOT e.g World of Tanks.  I like the 7 vs 7 format used in Blitz, it's like you're in a Tank Patrol.  WOT is a 15 vs 15 and can last anywhere from 5 minutes to 15 min.  If you get ""killed"" at 4 minutes into a WOT game, you can sit our urazz easily for 10 min, that is unless you read the instructions and figure out you can exit the games you've been killed in and begin a new game."

5655,Probably the best mobile game there is. It really transcends its platform. I actuallly prefer Blitz over the PC version. A game hasn't put its claws in me like this in a long time.

5672,"This is a strong game with a toxic player base and unrealistic combat. So, obviously, it's a very ambiguous experience for me: on one hand, the game itself can be a lot of fun and is one of the stronger tank games out there. On the other hand, a lot of people who play it are young know-it-alls, and the game can also take massive amounts of frustration and time. WarGaming's formula is simple: if you don't want to put forth the time and effort to get better tanks, you can just buy them, but that does mean that pay to win players exist.

Overall, I would rank this game 6.5/10. I prefer War Thunder myself, but because this game takes up a lot less RAM and space, I find myself more able to play this one."
5673,"Its free and an easy game to play, like old day games."
5674,Скам.
5675,"Insanely good, I have this on Switch, and your progress is cross-saved, awesome.  Wish there were bigger fights though like the mainline games."
5676,"I played this game on mobile since 2016. I spent hundreds of hours on this game, but I would not recommend this game to the others. 

The game itself is not bad. Not buying any of premium account or gold might be challenging to play continuously in Tier 9 and 10, though. (Unless you play like professional every round, you will keep losing your credits without premium account.) There are some OP tanks (Smasher, Annihilator, Dracula and so on) and WG usually sell them in random boxes. It is horrible, but one good OP tank cannot guarantee the victory of their team.

The real big problem is the salty and aggressive people playing the game. People here tend to be very aggressive towards their own team, not their enemies. (Well, there are some idiots saying 'fck u' after being killed, but those pseudo-humans are not so common.) Even if your win rate is over 60%, you definitely will get some messages like 'nub', 'delete the game', and 'moron' if you lose with relatively low damage (ofc the players with high damages were just sniping from your back, with heavies). This really will piss you off, especially when you get those spams from players with win rate 30% or 40%. They made 'filter' option in the game, but there is no way to stop being offended by team chats during the game. For the beginners, for your mental health, go play the other games. Stop wasting your time being pissed off by 12-year-old boys."
5677,this good
5678,Great Game! Yes sometimes it can be very frustrating but in the end it still doesnt have p2w at all. And dont even think about complaining about the game or its mechanics as long as you dont have 10k+ battles and 1000 hours of playtime cuz thats the point where you atleast should know enough about the game to say sth about it.
5679,good

5699,looks good
5700,"AWesome fun
"
5701,"graphics offer no improvement for playing with a PC
enemies always feel like they're 10x more powerful even with the exact same tank
the grind is less than war thunder but the pay to win aspect is so apparent I'm surprised EA doesn't own the company who made this game
WHY ARE WE LIMITED ON THE AMOUNT OF TANKS WE CAN SELL PER DAY?
why is there no way to store tanks so that they cannot be used but are still owned by the player
why do tanks literally turn invisible if they aren't spotted, like recently i looked over a hill, saw nobody, got to the top literally half a second later and a tank appeared out of thin air
the hetzer enemies use seems 100x more powerful for 0 reason

5734,Great game that the devs like to ruin with broken tanks. Its not completely unbearable and I still love playing but I Wargaming has little respect for their game balance in the middle tiers. They sell OP tanks knowing people will buy them and sometimes gamble for them!!!

5738,its not og WoT but its ok. has a majority of tank trees and the same mildly toxic people woo!
5739,Ignore monkeys that tell you this game is good.
5740,"First, ignore the play time. I have been playing on and off for over five years now, and can say it is pretty fun. Just know, it is a multiplayer game, so toxicity exists. The game offers ways for you to avoid seeing it, so you make make choices about how much you will deal with it. The game itself, however, is pretty well designed if not always well balanced. If you only care about one sentence in this review, it should be the next one. The better you get at the game, the more fun and more frustrating it becomes. If you do decide to play, go ahead and look up content on Youtube on how to play well. There are several game mechanics that are not explained very well by the actual game, so Youtube and the official forums are great resources."
5741,"easier than the normal pc game, so its quite fun to get some good stats :)"
5742,This game is very impressive for the fact that you can also play on mobile. (I highly reccomend this game)
5743,"Great game to play with friends and runs good on basically any pc.

5744,It's interactive and fun. Learn about tanks and how they operate.
5745,"It's a great game, easy to play, and very exciting."
5746,"this game is good. i really like it. has so many tanks. but there are things i dont like it from this game. first is there are ammos who cost gold for owned it, second i met with the opponent who have higher tier than me. and the last is the cost for research is quite expensive for me. btw this game has cheap premium pass. in rupiah its only cost Rp.75.000,00"

5755,"Wargaming has allowed repeated RACIST and BIGOTTED people to target and harrass people via in game battlechat that cannot be permanently disabled Parents DO NOT LET CHILDREN PLAY THIS GAME!

The chat cannot be perma locked with parental features.

I have replays of repeated racist attacks on players OWN TEAM MATES after the offenting player loses in battle.

Then the rest of the team just have to keep playing while withstanding ILLEGAL harassment the entire rest of the game.

Wargaming makes it take approx. 10 minutes to report these issues. you cannot do it in game, you have to go to their website and log in to do so, and have a saved replay, and the full info on the player who did it.

After all of that they will not tell the victim the outcome of the report, each time they simply say, it has been resolved.

This is the last time i'm correcting my review. wargaming allows ILLEGAL activity, and I refuse to be bullied off of a game I paid a lot to play so I am warning others.

DO NOT PLAY



I will still leave the original bad review attached as those issue are still a problem, however I am changing my recommendation from do not recommend to recommend. 

My reason for changing this is after playing another 250 hours plus, Wargaming released temporarily REALISTIC MODE. What an amazing mode, that leveled the playing field for players of every level of play!

No more instant reveals for the entire team because 1 enemy drives through on a self deletion mission. Camo ACTUALLY is important! It forces players to ACTUALLY pay attention as apposed to the normal, drive around slowly until there's a red dot to drive at.

It was a temporary mode and is over now, but if brought back would be a VERY welcome addition to the permanent modes! If REALISM MODE comes back I definately recommend you try it.


ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I like tanks, and the game can be fun at times, but the broken crew system giving older players massive advantage over newer players, EVEN PREMIUM PAYING MEMBERS, as I do have premium, makes it so that at the approximate time you hit tier 7 games start to become more and more unwinnable do to enemies spotting you half of the map away, as well as having premium pay to win tanks that bounce shells even directly put into clear targets.

This combined with the issue of either matchmaking putting you with the same enemy tanks all the time, or that there are only like 5 tanks used out of the huge choice. i.e. KV-2, Churchill, Matilda. Makes the game even more repetative then a normal fremium game.

I'll add that also many tanks you might want to play with are also locked behind an experience wall, which you cannot grind past hardly because your often low tier and one shotted do to constant KV-2 and premium tankteam selection.

You cannot opt out of playing matches against premium, Pay to Win tanks.

I've also looked into just paying to skip the tanks I dont want to play with. So we're talking real money.

to do so affordable would require you to grind until tier 5 or 6, so, 40-60 hours if you want to try say 4 or 5 tanks. Then you have to buy into the premium gold currency, then use the gold to pay to fully upgrade the tank you do not want. afterward you need to continue playing with the upgraded tank that you do not want, and earn as much XP as you can, and then use gold currency to convert your commander XP from each tank into free XP that can be used for any tank. If your lucky you can raise enough quickly, in4 to 6 hours, to move up 1 tier to tier 7.

Then you will have to buy more gold, max that tank, earn more XP and then pay more to convert, and try again.

I will keep playing just because I love tanks, but my suggestion for the casual player is, unless you like the low tier tanks, and have fun playing them on a free account, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! And if your more serious like me, bare in mind they have been known to severely NERF tanks you spend hundreds of hours grinding to get. Making your time wasted and taking away your hard earned battle ability.

So to sum it up, this is a FREEMIUM game that you cant even pay to use the tank you want unless its a premium exclusive, so early players WILL walk all over you.

And to clarify the Crew system. Once you start training crew, it would take over 50,000 games to complete!!!

Older accounts had this all unlocked for free right off the bat because they already had time in the game. So they gained another massive advantage over even PREMIUM new players.

Some of the  crew upgrades make any tank of that type, 30+ percent better, for no cost!"
5756,"Not bad alternative of WOT. Nice graphics, many tanks and plus it's avainable on Mobile Devices. I'm not such a big fan of this game, but sometimes it's funny to play with friends, make strategies, discover new tanks y'know. Anyways, I'm recommending this game."

5777,Very cool gsme of war
5778,I love you you love me we're a happy family
5779,"I've played this game since maybe mid-2015, I can say it's still really fun. I've played on my phone for most of that time and have only recently switched to Steam, the controls feel a lot better on here than on mobile. The game has gotten a bit crowded with battle pass stuff and loot boxes, but it's not a complete pay-to-win game.

I'd give it a 7.5/10. Without the battle passes and the loot boxes it would be a solid 9."
5780,"I played this game extensively on my mobile device. However, pc controls are better IMO. Nice game overall."
5781,"This is a stellar game. It's free to play, with some optional paid content: read, this is not PAY to WIN. I put roughly 5000 hours into this (it's cross compatible with Mobile, Windows 10, and Steam), before I bought a real money tank, and the only thing different now is that I have a tank that fits my playstyle a little better. This game is diverse, with lots of tanks, and is aptly described as ""the Thinking Man's FPS."" Gameplay is a little slower, with reload speeds in the seconds rather than fractions of a second, but it's still easy to get through several rounds in a half hour. One of my favorite games!"
5782,Fun if people talk back in chat to make tactics that work well to win.
5783,"I honestly prefer war thunder way more
"
5784,"original review: its a damn fun game at times, but if youre not willing to spend tons of hours and quite some bucks to progress faster/get some fun premium tanks its not worth your time. In general, I'm a very competitive person so your experience might differ, but if youre not gonna invest time to get good at it, blitz wont be too much fun for you, if youre a f2p player even less. but, if youre willing to spend 5,49€ a month to get the premium pass (you can play the regular for less rewards for free) then this is a fun game with mechanics not too difficult to learn but hard to master. graphics and audio arent the greatest obviously, it is after all, a mobile game. but you dont really realize that as unlike WT or wot PC youre always in the middle of action.
all in all, a 8/10, there are a couple overpowered pay to win tanks here and there but nothing you cant avoid. I likey

after another couple hundreds of hours playtime, I have to retract this statement. everything I said was and is true of course but I just cant recommend the game as it is right now. theres improvements everywhere but for new players who havent crossed the 5000 games played barrier yet, the teams are just horrendous. they'll do anything to make your gaming experience as terrible as possible and ruin your day. dont play if you want equally as skilled teammates or even just regular people who have played the game for more than 13 minutes."
5785,yes

5801,its good
5802,"good game
"
5803,"Anyway, maybe not too look like the WoT version that more universal. But the easy understand system, realistic system (even though the graphic and movement not too realistic but i like it.), and more variable tanks make this game enjoyed.

Reccomended for low end PC's or laptops"
5804,"If you don't know much about tank tactics, this game will be hard and frustrating.  If you do however, you can find fun in playing this. Honestly, i would recommend the full WoT game if your computer can run it, as the battles are of a larger scale, and you have a smaller chance of getting rushed by the entire enemy team."
5805,"This game is broken...
Encourages you to Pay to skip levels and get higher tier tanks.
So it goes 2 ways; you end up keep dying and lose credits, whereas on the other hand, you keep getting teamed up with noobs and keep losing and thus, lose credits.

So you're forced to pay real cash to play..."

if you are considering this game or any wargaming game, dont play them due to that many broken tanks are introduced at least once or twice a month that no matter what the community does or says they are not nerfed and it goes to show what wargaming cares about. I think thats enough for now"

5858,"Good game, even if you do not spend too much $$$. In this WAY better than war robots."
5859,"Its a simplified version of WoT. Battles take place on much smaller maps 500X500 meters I think. Teams are 7 players each.
Battles are short and fast paced, and you can play on a mobile phone. Its not really as pay to win as the bad reviews say, but there are way more premium tanks than free ones. The downsides to the game are the fact that the servers are filled with moronic players and the developers spend more time and effort adding premium tanks and content to the game, than the tech tree content, but a lot of fun can still be had with this game even for free."

5902,"(Disclaimer : I have 6000 battles and I did not play through steam)

   World of Tanks Blitz is a game that I would recommend only to players that want to enjoy the game for the game play, and not the behind the scenes content. Over the years wargaming has made decisions that have driven me from the game, but may not apply to all people.

   First of all why listen to me...
- Old unicum player with 6000 battles and 60% winrate. 
- Ex member of clan KRONO and current member of STORM, both well known and respected top North America clans.
   Don't believe me still... look up Gwingy on blitzstars.com , a stat tracking website for the game.


   Pros:
- Fun, fast paced game play that forces you to think quickly.
- Balanced tech tree tanks with equally balanced grind.
- Fun when you platoon with friends.
- Incentive to join a clan with good rewards.
- Fun strategic tournaments you can participate in.

   Cons:
- Company does not care about player complaints.
- More premium tank (tanks you buy with real money) emphasis than actual balancing and adding f2p content.
- Some premium tanks are blatantly broken in the current state and game developers will not balance them. 
- Sell tanks in ""crates"" that have 5% or less of a chance to drop, then sell the tank in the store in a gold (premium currency bundle) for much cheaper then many players spent on crates. 

   Overall, the reasons why I have come to just hate and regret logging into the game are because of the cons mentioned above. it can be fun and very rewarding to casual players, but for an old ex semi-pro player, its impossible for me to find joy playing the game. Take that how you wish when considering playing the game.

   TL;DR - An old, used to be fun, game has been ruined by game developer..."
5903,good
5904,this game suck! its still has bugs in it.

5908,"Even though it's a free game it's pay to win.  And the match-making in game is trash.  Plus excessive toxicity that can get you banned for nothing, simply because you don't want to be a part of the nonsense.  Definitely not a game I would reccomend"

5916,tonk go shoot shoot
5917,I love the fight style in this game its not fast paced in terms of getting some of the tanks WHICH IS AMAZING the battles are really fun and i only have 1 complaint about the game or maybe one thing that they could change and that is that you can be put in higher tier games with tanks that are a rank higher then you or lower then you cause i feel as if its not fair for either side because of the tanks in a higher tier.
5918,"This game is so unbalanced.....I love it.
Like yeah there are many premium tanks that are unfair to fight against. But man this game gets it's moments where not even the most broken premium tanks can defeat you. I live for those moments. I see a lot of people quiting this game and hating it but i belive it has potencial. If only the balancing department wasn't ran by monkeys......"
5919,i have been playing this for five years and its still fun. i have played on the microsoft version
5920,:)
5921,its good
5922,baby version of war thunder
5923,Pretty fun to play with friends you can also crossplay on phone and pc.
5924,If You want to rage because of potato servers or brainless team then this game is good for You.
5925,"This Game Match making is broken tbh, my teams are always confused, or afk or just brainless it seems. almost every game i do the most damage then my team and the enemy and still lose. Like literally i am always carrying and it gets repetitive and boring."
5926,great game yooo!!!
5927,"Originally, the game requires a lot of strategy. Especially on clan matches (In WoT, not Blitz). There's always that one tank that no one could penetrate, but one thin tank can. You have to know nearly every 8-10 tier tank in order to win a clan match. Because in tier 10, some tanks get special abilities. Any destroyer can easily kill you with 2-3 shots (1 if they know your fuel location). 10th tier USSR arty has AP shots. So it can destroy any tank with 1 shot. French arty has a magazine. Lights are just fast. Mediums reload fast. Heavies don't die. The main event is to protect the less durable to make them do damage to the enemy. The game itself has a mechanic to ensure this. If you do too less damage, you reload really fast. If you do moderate damage, you reload meh. If you do big damage, you reload really slow. And if you do absurd amount of damage, you basically have 1 shot and you go afk for the rest of the game. The thing is, you don't always penetrate. Lights are fast so they can go behind enemy lanes to penetrate enemies, do damage, spot and go back safely (last part doesn't always work). Mediums are moderately fast and they reload fast so they can camp heavies and force them to disrupt their position. Heavy tries to ensure their teammates safety so they harrass other heavies or if they have enhanced guns they can snipe arties or destroyers once lights spot them. Basically, the game requires so much strategy in 15 minutes. 

In the other hand, Blitz is just shoot and destroy. So it is pretty fun. Even more fun than WoT. Don't play WoT. Play Blitz."
5928,"easy to get gold and even premium upgrades as rewards for missions.
enjoying very much.  Prefer over original World of Tanks. Get into matches much faster."
5929,fun game
5930,Good game
5931,"unless you're a masochist and somehow have the holy patience of a saint that comes from a religious fanfiction. this is not for you, because the servers are choggy. it's badly optimized. the community is bad (hence the patience part). in short, no. i wouldn't recomment this circus of game. fun and new, yeah. but not worth playing for in the long run."
5932,Great game. Huge interest to keep playing for long
5933,"Like WoT, but simpler and runs better on lower-end machines."
5934,"cg
"
5935,It was a good game but now its becoming very hard to play day by day because  some tanks are very team dependent and new players who don't know how to deal with the enemy tanks end up camping or die quickly in higher tier battles. It is ruining the game for who are grinding for a tech tree tank.  Developers should slow down the progress of the game or introduce something to practice for the new players or else many people will leave this game eventually
5936,Pre-game user interface is difficult to use and not user friendly in places. The whole game comes across as a money grab for the developers. Game play is very BASIC. You cant play this game without being in a clan unless you like being endless cannon fodder. The game gets boring really quickly and the challenges aren't much better.
5937,i like it much
5938,fun free game. dont know what else to say
5939,yea
5940,godly
5941,Nice war Game!
5942,"I used to love World of Tanks, but the matches can be overly long.  Blitz really addresses that, instead of 15v15 you get 7v7 and it plays a lot faster"
5943,"Pay to win game, i do not raccomend to play this game if you serch a competitive one"
5944,Fun multiplayer game
5945,Nothing just wish as mac updates it will keep the lower level of update too. I play on a mac 2014
5946,"It's not actually free to play. Once you hit t6 the rewards will be spent on maintenance for your tank and you will be unable to progress further without spending real world money. Even when you rank among the highest in a match the rewards are just not enough and don't increase as your tank tier increases. Players will also spend real world money on special ammunition that significantly increases the damage of their tanks even from early ranks. That means you have to keep feeding it money in order to be effective.
This is a Pay to Win game wrongly presenting itself as free to play."
5947,yes
5948,Tanks
5949,"Not bad, i recommend it to people who have trash  computers like me, would be cool if they added more variety to combat though, its just peek shoot go back to hiding peek shoot go back to  hiding."

5954,game bad lol

If you can control the frustration of wallet warriors buying wins DL and enjoy."
5966,"Super fun game!! There is over 300 tanks and all of them are fun! I have 221 tanks and 22,000 battles myself and so when I say this game is fun, I mean it. Whats even better is that its FREE to download! You can also buy premium tanks that are even more fun! There are 4 different types of tank, Heavy tanks, Medium tanks, Light tanks, and tank destroyers. My personal favorite are Medium tanks because you can go pretty fast and they have decent armor. My favorite Medium tank is the T-22 Medium. Over all I highly recommend this game.

5975,well made and supported
5976,"if you want to enjoy playing a game, this isnt it. teams that are either afk or bots 9 out of 10 matches. pay to win on a scale rarely seen. literally, the paid vehicles outpower the non paid vehicles 2 to 1 at the same rank. i thought war thunder was bad with pay to win, but this takes the cake. makes it basically unplayable if you want to actually have a good time. if you want to win, you HAVE to pay. theres actually no other way to do it past rank 4. the second you hit rank 5 you cant even damage the paid tanks. went many round where id hit a tank 10-15 times and not able to do a single point of damage to it because it had armor twice as thick as any non paid tank at its rank. you couldnt penetrate it unless you also had a paid tank. ive already uninstalled the game, and when im done writing this review im removing it from my account because im just that disgusted with this trash, and the entire community that holds it up as anything other than a pay to win trash game."

5988,tank go pew pew
5989,"Great game  Save 
your gold for good premium tanks"
5990,I would if my friends are into games like this but if they aren't then no
5991,"The gameplay in this game is deep and strategic, with a really wide variety of tanks for different playstyles. 
Not all mediums work the same, sometimes they shouldn't even be used in the same roles. The same goes for pretty much all other classes, except maybe tank destroyers. 

Situational awareness is key, and using the camo system to your advantage as well. You should probably look up some advice online or you will get screwed past tier V. 

Some people hate the RNG, but part of the game is about managing it. Different tanks have different dispersion values, aim time, aim time while moving, etc. Play your tank to its strengths. 

PROS: 
1. Deep gameplay mechanics, good fun, requires thinking. 
2. Good networking, finding clans, player statistics, making friends, etc. 
3. Competitive scene is decent. 
4. Lots of info online, big community. 

CONS:
1. You can get screwed by matchmaking all the time. You might get a team of all 45% winrate while the other team is all sitting at 60%. Playing with braindead people can be very frustrating. 

2. Toxic community. People hate each other, calling each other nubs quite often. 

3. Split community: 
15% of the community cares only about their stats, so they just run seal clubbing tanks in platoons (basically tanks that seem at the lower tiers where players don't know how to deal with them yet). 
Another 25% are the idiots. These are the players that drive light tanks and charge forward, only to die in the first 30 seconds.
Another 50% is the average player. These guys are meh, and they don't really think about the overall strategy. They can be pretty indecisive, missing opportunities, making poor decisions, and pushing / not pushing at the wrong times. However, they can clutch up occasionally. 
The final 10% are the honest unicums. They are good enough so that it doesn't matter what tank or tier they play, they can do well enough to contribute in every game. 

4. Greedy Company. 
Now the game isn't actually pay to win for the most part. It's pay to progress faster. You can use money to skip the grinds, or you can buy premium tanks that earn you more credits per battle. For the most part, these premium tanks are balanced and aren't more powerful than their tech tree counterparts. 

However, this trend is gradually breaking with the introduction of more and more kinda OP tanks that you can only pay for. 

EX: OBJ 252U, T-22 Medium, T-54 mod. 1, Smasher

5. If you like history you might find the statistics and placements of different vehicles disappointing. 
6. If you despise RNG then don't play this."

This is still a second world war simulation tank game not a fckn casino. improving the matchmaker? no. Balance the tanks? no. release a new premium every week? hell yea. money is everything that count's for wargaming. and if we (myself included) do don't stop playing this game they won't change anything because they are making money anyway. what they really need is 90% of they players stop playing the game to open their eyes.i have about 27k battles now, a win rate of 67% and an average dmg of 2.2k. But everything i just said is taking the fun away, battle for battle"
6036,"Been playing this game for 6 years straight. I have because Wargaming has never given up to bring exciting new content to the game. 
Plus as far as tank games go for mobile, this is by far the best of them. 
The plus side is that not only is it on mobile, but STEAM, has made it available on PC as well, and in my opinion It works much better. 
There is always something to learn on this game about the past, as far as war. And They every once in awhile through something in that many players such as myself who are collectors of rare tanks, enjoy. New tanks.

6088,great strategy game
6089,A fun yet still competitive stripped-down version of the full World of Tanks game.
6090,"Just broke 1000 hours mark after 3 years. Don't bother trying to play, the only thing you will get is a mental breakdown. Everyone is toxic, people with 43% WR telling 60%ers they suck, noobs camping with heavies, WG putting OP premiums is over the top.... Smashers, Annihilators, T-22s, T54E2,  WZ 120-1 FTs, 252Us, VK 90.01... Some of those OP prems you can get for gold and real cheap which breaks the game even more.  MM is broken and unbalanced, and when you combine all of that with BS RNG you end up having a metal breakdown. Nowadays it's too easy to get to tier X with all the XP certificates, boosters, cheap deals that enable you not having to grind or play stock. And that leads to people having no clue what they are doing playing tier X. It's came to the point where you can do 3000 or even 4000+ damage in a game and still lose 7-2. You can give your best but it just does't pay off. After this long of playing and sticking to this game trough it's BS I'm finally quitting.

Update: Came back after 3 months, yeah game is fucking broken, from rigged mm to brain dead teams.
You start doing well, WELL FUCK YOU! Now we gonna put you in 40% team agianst 60% team.
You start getting motivated and get more competative? We goona make sure you lose your next 10 battles, get a mental breakdown, and do even worse. Suck my dick wargaming. Also, ping spikes bullshit isn't solved yet, get your shit together you fucking cunts!"

6100,"This game is great and brings back so many childhood memories for me. However, I'm not too certain as to why they made big changes to the tech tree a while back and got rid of some of my favorite tanks. Nonetheless, the game is very fun, however World of Tanks exists to there is little reason to play this game unless you are looking for a casual game. This is much more casual than World of Tanks which is relatively complicated and competitive. There are aspects of both games that I enjoy and I would like to see mechanics from both games implemented into the other. 4.5/5 good job Wargaming!"

6106,This game is a fun and exiting game that brings a new meaning to world of tanks.
6107,its pretty good all things considering but it does take a lot of farming for coins and other materials
6108,"This is a great game, over 1000 hrs played my only issue is the new players coming in with Paid tanks and can't play. I have spent about $20.00 total to get the monthly bonuses, I think they are worth it.

keep up the good work WoT Blitz

6109,The matchup engine is poor. Most games are 0-7 or 7-0 with heavy control of you win/loss statistics.

6113,"This game's graphics are not to bad. I've seen much better. However if you love to play tank battle games you will enjoy playing this. A word of caution, do not buy any tanks on the game expecting better damage/armor. The tanks you get free over time with in game money is just as good."

6122,fun but players can be toxic as hell
6123,i enjoyed it
6124,It's okay i guess..
6125,"The matchmaking system is absolutely random. If you want to get randomly smoked or lose due to your teammates doing nothing, that is the game for you. Adding the fact that grinding a line takes forever, You'll be driven crazy by the time you do.

Edit: Some servers are also unresponsive. It feels as if they have a server or two for a whole continent. If you're located in the far zone, you're donzo. 80 ping minimum which even jumps at times up to big amounts even when you have a very stable connection. Lag compensation isn't really a thing. You just have to wait half a second for your screen to respond so you can move/shoot which obviously is very problematic. They need to improve and reinforce their servers."
6126,Its world of tanks but somehow worse
6127,now the asian server is good
6128,Been playing since 2014 and being free to play is close to impossible compared to back in the day. Devs have gone as far as to encourage minors to gamble British pound sterling for a tactical advantage. Probably spent over £1k in the last 2 years where this game has changed into a complete cash grab. Dont recommend to anyone with expendable income
6129,"Achtung (Pay2Win) Panzer!
I initially gave this game a thumbs up despite it's flaws, however, after playing more and more I realized that was a huuuuge mistake.

Pros:
Pretty good visuals
Good sound effects
Tons of WWII/early cold war tanks & tank destroyers from different nations, some of which never went beyond design phase back in the day.
Fun, non-stop explosive action (for while it lasts).

Cons:
The company's greed can only be rivaled by that of the EA's. Let's start with the tanks. In other games you might get broken and overpowered units/weapons,... by accident and they'll get nerfed fast. Not in this game, they intentionally make very powerful broken tanks and balance is a joke to them. Tanks like Annihilator, Smasher, Dracula,... have been in the game for a long time and they never got nerfed and never will (unless WG changes it's policy which i doubt). Old premium tanks can be bought at around 10$ or less when they are on sale, but the new ones are sold at 25-30$ (like the quickscoping M41D).

Lootboxes are as scummy as you'd expect (or even more). Personally, I've paid for and opened more than 80 of them, which all had a chance to drop a tank. These include surprise containers (introduced in late January), Tier 6 containers and Chinese & German Invasion containers. Now, you might think that out of over 80 lootboxes I've gotten at the very least 8-10 tanks, right? Wrong, I've gotten only 4, one of them complete garbage (Badger) and another was already available for sale in store (Lowe). More than 40 of those boxes supposedly had a 10% drop chance for tanks, but I only got 2, so trust those numbers at your own risk. Also, they recently they've started selling Smasher containers with a 3% drop rate (I'm not kidding, check for yourself) for that tank. I can only hope that more countries follow the Belgium's example and ban such practices.

Matchmaking is another issue. You might think that the game teams you up with/against people whose skills are similar to that of yours. Nope, you either get teamed up with/against noobs & bots. And that's another disaster, lots and lots of bots are present in the game even in 8-10 tier matches which is ridiculous. The aforementioned broken tanks can also be present with no limits (you go up against 2 Annihilators, a Helsing and a Chimera). 

Not only there are pay2win tanks, there are pay2win mechanics as well. Premium status provides 50% more exp and credits per each battle. Premium Tanks also get another +50% credits per battle. All sorts of boosters can be bought which makes grinding through the tech tree tanks much faster. There is premium shells that can be bought by gold, which have much higher penetration values than normal shells. So, while you might enjoy having a tank with a thick frontal armor against free players, others can easily load those premium shells and penetrate your frontal armor. These shells deal slightly less damage than normal shells but again penetrating and dealing damage is far better than having your shots ricochet off the enemy tanks. Free players can get these shells too by paying credits but each shell costs roughly around 4000 credits. So if you carry just 5 of them you lose 20k credits per match regardless of winning or losing.

And here's a fun fact, If you want to change your name, they'll charge you 2500 Gold for it.
There are also too few maps.

To summarize, this game is not for those who want to play for free and earn stuff by grinding. Free players earn less exp and credits, don't have access to overpowered tanks, get much less boosters, free exp,... through battle passes,... Free players can earn Gold roughly around 500-600 per month (that depends on you being in a clan and your clan members doing their own missions too). But a simple good premium tank (without camo or equipment,...) costs around 7000 gold. Sure, you might get better deals for tanks (around 5000 gold) but those ones are usually below average or outright garbage. So, you'll be grinding for months just to be able to buy a single premium tank. Tech tree tanks are good and powerful too, but usually come up short against premium ones. At this current state with all those expensive tanks and lootboxes and no way for free players to earn anything good, I can only recommend this game to Billionaires that are ready to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on it."
6130,我觉得要加上队伍，全局聊天功能，地图选择功能。   坦克的研发太贵了，便宜点更好。
6131,mega hra :D
6132,"Through the years Wargaming has added premium tank after premium tank. First it used to only affect tier 6 to 8, but now tier 9 and 10 is also getting infected with this P2W disease. I did put a lot of hours into this game and I started back in 2015 but through the time the game has lost its charm. If you just wanna play this game casually it's okay I guess, but if you are looking for something you can really set your teeth in, then keep looking, because this game simply isn't the effort, hours, and especially not your money worth."
6133,"reayly fun and doesnt take too much space
"
6134,"very enjoyable grinding experience, game similar to many other war type of game where you start with humble small tank, which you can choose which country you want your tank from, then from very humble tank, by playing couple of match you will gained bunch of star and money so you can upgrade your humble tank into a monster of war machine. Dominate the battlefield and show them the might of your tanks."
6135,"gud to play
"
6136,ez
6137,"
The best tank game I've played in my life, you can see all the tanks in the 2nd world war, my favorite tiger 1 and tiger 2 tank made me very happy, you should definitely play the game, I strongly recommend it is a magnificent game."
6138,"This game has broken matchmaking.
Unstable server (high ping of 150 and above) despite having good connection.

Until this game is fixed, I'll give this a thumbs down.
"
6139,shit game
6140,Nice Game
6141,It a good game.
6142,Takes some time to learn the ropes but fun game
6143,"Very fun game, until you reach tier 4 or 5 most of your enemy players will be bots, after which the game becomes much more strategic and competitive. I find this game much more fun than the base world of tanks because the matches are much faster, the tanks are easier to grind, and overall the game is much faster paced. 

a quick tip for newcomers, ALWAYS go with your teammates, doesn't matter how much better you think you'd do sniping or off to the side, go with the team. you will win more matches I promise you."
6144,"it is a nice game, you should play it with your friends.
but it gets boring after 10-20 hours"
6145,"Played it back when it came to steam, fun quick matches. Came back to it recently and my account is gone. Do NOT play this game"
6146,"very good geim.

6149,"Crap, I should buy Sprocket Instead.

400 hrs full regrets and anger. don't be like me.

Buy Sprocket or Tank Mechanic Simulator instead of spending money in this unfair P2W Game."
6150,"cheaters shooting though walls and rocks that no one else can shoot though.   I hate cheaters they ruin your game. and the comment ""gg bitch"" at the end really sealed the deal for me.

   if you like games that people cheat at then I guess this is another one of those games.

besides the a-hole cheaters I did enjoy the game."
6151,"Between the grab for your cash, the rigged games, and the general abuse dished out by other players one wonders why anyone plays this sham. At its heart this is a great game but the abuse and heavy handed manipulations of teams and results makes one question why anyone would play for more than a couple of weeks."
6152,This game is shit dont play this roblox game
6153,"good game
shitty spotting."
6154,fun
6155,"Toxic as heck, majority of players are like kids who are like 12 that play very poor, matchmaking is rigged for me. Absolutely not a game for people who hate MMO games and get too serious about winning or playing with other good players. Get teamed up with bots and dumb players who do jack all and just get demolished by the enemy. If you want to have fun, sure good game for that. apart from that, it is trash, majority of people don't know or care about ""TEAM PLAY"" or ""TEAMWORK"", no such thing in this toxic game, definitely do not recommend it for players that get competitive or get serious. Overall, a horrible, trash and very very toxic game!"
6156,Amazing game
6157,"Game như bùi nhưng mà cũng ok nếu có tiền để nạp mua xe hiếm.
Chơi tạm tạm cho steam lẫn mobile. Nhưng mà mobile k có lock on target nên hơi ngáo đá tí :)"
6158,Fun tank mechanics. Terrible match making. Can be expensive. Needs a campaign mode. Edit: Match Making has only gotten worse.
6159,tank go boom

But remember if you really like it, be prepared for some hardcore grinding from tiers IV to X, it gets insane, also, although there are many tanks, not too many are very viable. Its the kinda game where you need to get to know the mechanics to be able to win and eventually dominate. Money can be used, but its not completely pay-to-win (unless you go against limited premium tanks, screw those.)"

perfection... 

10/10 playing SPGs on original WOT should be a violation of international law"
6222,good
6223,very good
6224,"Its the best game so yeah you should get it. It's basically better then normal WOT on PC because there is no artillery and its a 7v7 matchmaking. The game can be super frustrating because of bad players on your team so you can end up losing even though you did way and beyond. The best way to experience the game is to play/grind your way to at the very least tier 8 because in the lower tiers the game doesn't have the same enjoyment and variation between tanks. The best part about this game is honestly the community as it brings everyone together and is one of the least toxic games but obviously there will be the one off.
The balancing of tanks is alright but there are some pay to win aspects of the game where for example War Gaming released the annihilator and only those who cashed out £10+ got to get a broken tank that in tier 7 is one of the most op tanks in it's tier. Speaking of tier 7 the tanks available to play in that tier make tier 7 the most broken tier in the game and that's why you don't want to base your opinion of the game once you reach tier 7 as tier 8 is way better and is one of the more enjoyable and it represent the game as a whole more with good balancing and a new mechanic called autoreloader's in the European nation tech tree which betters the experience when you fight tanks with that mechanic and when you are able to use it yourself. This game requires you to think most of the time when you are playing to be successful like reading enemy lineups, predicting enemy movements, taking cover on certain angles, mechanics of enemy tank guns because they are not all the same and common sense (This has to be said because there are so many players who lack common sense that you got to say it). War Gaming also do events some times and all the time when there is a holiday like Christmas and Halloween so they like to give away good tanks for free with some grinding. Overall this game is worth a try and it's actually getting more and more popular by the second with 60000+ players playing at once, and the game is very interesting and although it maybe a bit slower paced than you average game it is definitely way faster than WOT PC with average 3 min+ games and yeah thats most of the reasons you should check the game out. I haven't reviewed every part of the game so find out what I missed by playing the game :). bye bye."

Then you will notice once you start getting in matches with players with top tier tanks, they will destroy your tank in no time. Because of this, they want you to pay for the tanks. Making this game arcadeish it makes it additive and developers know you will pay up.. This game is one big advertisment throws sales and prices right in your face.

If you are playing a bad tank there is no outplay to be done, the tank is just bad and it won't be able to penetrate heavies even through the back, meta tanks is all that people play so you'll be absolutely seal clubbed as a new player, and oh the gameplay is just awful, you're forced to camp like in CS:GO except there is no skill to it, no headshots, no weak points, barely any movement skill and even if you know someone is in a position 90% of times they'll only be showing the strong spots of the armor in an angle so there's not an absolute thing you can do about it. All this issues are still a thing even after SIX f*cking years, yes, SIX years and they haven't fixed sh*t. Wargaming you're really good at making trash games, well done.
Edit: Dark, if a bad tank is bad because it is literally unable to kill some tanks instead of just having lower than average stats (Meaning in a 1v1 position it's forced in a loss) then there's a clear balancing problem isn't it?"

6268,I think that this game is fun and have a good time playing it. Though there is a 50% chance every one one your time dies and there are 5 tanks on you. My only problem with it is the premium ammo but games gotta make money.
6269,IT IS GOOD ONE  THING THAT IS A BIT ENOING IS THE GRAFICS AND THE REALISME LIK IN THE OPTIC VIEW YOU CAN SE THE BARLE

"
6271,"annihilator, smasher, rockets, avatars, crates with slot machine mechanics, events that are worth your time only if you buy a premium pass... they really put a lot of effort in f***ing this game up"
6272,"I play it alot since Day 1., very good graohics for the platform. somewhat realistic. i use pc version on steam and i think personally they should not allow pc to compete against tablet. i think pc out maneuvers better then my touch control navitgating on the tablet. i feel my score rising since i switched to using mouse keyboard controls."
6273,Good fast games.
6274,"World of Tanks Blitz is the mobile version of World of Tanks. It is a 7v7 fast-paced tank shooter with 4 tank classes - Light, Mediums, Heavies and Tank Destroyers. There are 10 tiers and there are a handful of different nations.

I have played this game on-and-off since 2014. I also was a unicum player and I have also had a lot more hours on mobile - about 1k - and currently, it is not worth playing. 

1. The tutorial for new players is ABYSMAL. It only covers how to move, shoot and some very basic mechanics. Then they're thrown into a battle. All battles under are full of noobs due to Wargaming's fault and also seal clubbers (people who play lower ranks to boost their stats). The players then usually grind to mid-high ranks with no strategies or tactics like side-scraping. Some don't even know the difference between AP, APCR or HE shells - I have literally had teammates only go HE shells, whether it was due to inexperience or for ""( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) le memes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"", I don't know.

2. The community is insanely toxic. Keep in mind, it was originally meant for mobile which most children and teenagers had access to - whether it be their own or their parent's. That being said - we can infer the majority of the playerbase is below 18. Now, the children aren't much of a problem in toxicity; they're just bad, unless they're some child prodigy. Teenagers are usually the main problem. They just turn into the most toxic kids I have ever seen, even more toxic than CS:GO. They usually say something like ""delet game noob"" or ""u frxck idot"", all whilst you are trying to fight like 3 enemies and this kid just goes all out. I even have had some go to my DMs on the messages to just badmouth me.

But I don't care about that - they're just rowdy teens. The actual toxic part is literally hindering your game. Some WoT Blitz YTbers have covered this topic already; some teammates intentionally platoon just to block you and ram you. They don't care about winning or dying, they just want to make you rage and lose. They exist in high levels as well. They don't even grind - they buy a premium vehicle (which is stupid, Wargaming. They don't care about noobs beating matchmaking and potentially ruining the match, they just want money.) which they can buy up to tier 8. It is stupid.

3. Pay 2 Win. The best tanks usually cost real-life money. Enough said.

4. Wargaming. As I have said before, Wargaming is very money-driven. They will usually put ridiculous containers usually have a really bad chance of even breaking even. Getting the top prize is like unboxing an unusual in TF2. Don't buy stupid containers.

5. Update 5.5. (This is more of a personal rant so it's not really relevant) Any OGs and vets will know what I mean. It was the update when they removed many tanks in the low-mid tiers. Wargaming did this so newbies had less of a confusing introduction which is reasonable. It did remove many tanks though. R.I.P toaster tank, R.I.P mini maus, R.I.P duck tank, R.I.P many more.

If you're going to pick this game up, you WILL rage and get salty. It will be a grindfest. If you read through this, thanks?"
6275,"my son and i love the game, since he is below 10 it helps that i guide him all through the game and act as advisor/lookout."
6276,e
6277,i like the support for windows 7
6278,"garbage. you need to make a filter for tiers for people that are lower tiers to battle. i go into a lobby and get destroyed. its completely unfair. thee people on here need to be filtered as well. they just drive right up to me and circle around me over and over and over and over, its toxic"
6279,it is a fun game
6280,Good game in general. The comunity goes both ways. The balance is questionable but not bad. Wargaming is amazing in how they handle their realations but outrageous in how they deal with technical support.
6281,"Great game!!!
"
6282,Awful. Dont even try playing it. Like litteral garbage that no one should play. If you have money to waste or your psychics or you are a masochist then this game is prfect for you. I hope that developers will think about their existance in this world. Game feels unplayable at times. Because game decides when you win and when you loose. Game decides everything basicly except where you go and which tank you buy.
6283,"Never buy anything from this UNFAIR company Wargaming.net They are making an imbalanced match setups to help opposite side to win.

Developers of blitz are too far from their gamers. So, the rarest certificate was obtained from container. But it has timer. I have no way to investigate X-tier tank in just One hour. And no way to apply this discount to any tank of X tier. So, this mockery was the final blow. And my decision is to delete this shіt from my PC.

6290,ok so first i want to get this out of the way people say this is a pay to win game and in some ways it can be but at the same time some of the most op tanks are free and this is a free game and they have to monotize it somehow i usually wait until i have at least 100 hours until i review unlike game critics at ea or some shit like that can say that teir 1-5 are very fun to be in and very fun to explore but there is so many pay to play bitches in 6-8 its not funny its downright sad but the community is actually very non toxic there nice well at least most i got called loser trash just yesterday for some reason but other than toxic 9 year olds that just came out of getting clapped with a ak or 725 or whatever you guys think is op nowa days its a very freindly experiance i think its a good game to just have a nice time and relax

If you've got a shitty team who camps in the back and never even leaves spawn, you're guaranteed a loss.
This is literally how the game works in every single tier. One nets you a win, One is a guaranteed loss."

6297,I like to grind tank lines the only thing wrong is a little rage here and there other than that it's a good game.
6298,"-pros: tanks
-cons: tanks"
6299,"WOTB is very fun and addictive, albeit mildly pay to win. The game is still quite playable even if you are free-to-play, the premium vehicles are generally better, but not overwhelmingly so. If you want to be a serious player, look up Youtube videos on the game, as learning by yourself takes a very long time. Whatever you do, DO NOT rush up to high tiers or buy premium tanks at high tiers as a new player, as you will not know how to play them and likely anger your teammates and not have much fun yourself. The community is pretty toxic (I'm probably not one to talk), but there are kind players out there willing to help newcomers improve their gameplay."
6300,"Perfect for if you like tank games. Although it is health based so not 100% accurate, I think I like it more than War Thunder."
6301,"This game is very well thought out and developed. However I do have some ""Issues"" I guess you could say. One is the battle force is on each team is small, only seven players. I understand this is a mobile game and mobile games have limitations but an odd number personally I think is not right and should be put to eight, but that's just me. My second small issue is artillery tanks are not available in this game unlike its counterparts on PC and for console. My third issue with the game is tank selection and variety is small and for the much larger countries such as America, Britain, and Germany you can only use about half of all tanks available. I would recommend this game if you wish to just have fun and not get serious in tank warfare. However if you wish to take it further I do not recommend this game but rather the console or PC version."

6315,while this game is really fun at some parts it just becomes a pay to play game spsficly levels IV V VI they are realy hard to get past but as son as you get past those angering consent ads the rest is pritty fair
6316,over all a great game you should get it
6317,"This game is easy to learn and play. The graphics are pretty good and the sound is ok. 
The bonus system is a little tricky to figure out but you don't need bonuses and specials to play anyway, so don't worry about those. For fans of World of Tanks, this is a way to relax from the rigors of the full game."

6344,this game is exciting and amazing
6345,"Pretty good compared with original world of tanks. Not quite as heavy as the og game but thats the point, so can be played with weak pc or phone. Think they managed to get the important stuff in the game and even if you can buy creates and premium it doesnt matter because it is still pretty balanced it just goes faster to higher tiers with premium.

8/10 ""pretty good"""
6346,amazing 5 stars!
6347,Funny Tank game. I blew up other tanks and it was funny
6348,I honestly prefer the xbox one version of world of tanks to this. Is this a good game? Yes. Can you pick it back up at any time? yes. Does the monetization get extremely annoying? Oh very much so. This version tries to push you into their store so hard. I just had the game soft lock on me and become unplayable because it wants me to spend gold that i don't have. So in short good game with terrible practice.
6349,"With hundreds of hours on mobile and pc combined, this is my 100% factual review on WOT blitz.

GOOD: Great game that is equally addicting and fun, would definitely recommend since its free.  Developers are constantly coming out with updates and attempt to listen to the community.  

Warnings: 
1. Community is toxic, people cry every time they lose calling their team ""shit"" and ""morons."" (most common phrases)
2. Pay to win - Most of the best tanks cost IRL money, which gives wallet warriors advantages.  It's like a typical mobile game where almost anything is possible with enough money.
3.  You're going to get mad at this game, just like any other team game.  You could get 6-7k dmg w/ ace tanker badge and 6 destroyed tanks but your team still loses.
4.  War gaming tries to scam you with their shop, often advertising trash containers or tanks as something great.  Make sure to do your research on a tank or container before spending money on it."
6350,.
6351,its fun.
6352,"It is entertaining and the events during new year and Christmas is amusing especially the mode last year ""Gravity Force"". The tanks are floating due to zero gravity even the speed increased, I enjoyed drifting with my AMX ELC bis because it has a limit rotation of the turret and the drifts help me aim faster. Even when you shoot is funny to watch because the lights tanks floats in the air after getting hit or firing the enemies, when you ram each other the damage is 5x effective than in a regular match though the one in high speed and have low armor dies easily. Still I recommend this game to those who like historical combats and the thrills, keep  up the good work guys!"
6353,"very poor match making, you rely on your team mates a lot and if they are sh!t you are done(which a lot of time they are) 
don't recommend this game at all and I'm so regretful of spending money in this bs ."
6354,e
6355,"I've played this game both on here and on mobile. Much prefer this over the mobile version. I ported all my progress onto a computer and haven't looked back since.
The game itself is good. Maps are balanced, graphics good etc etc.

But the tanks themselves are debatable. If you have a game with no/few premium tanks on either team, then the game will be relatively balanced. However, there are many ridiculous tanks. An example is the Smasher. Tier 7 tank that has high HE damage (one-shots all tanks in the lower tier with aim, and many its tier) and a reload too fast to have with it. 

And therein lies the problem. These tanks also usually cost a significant amount of premium currency; or are in loot-boxes with a 1-5% chance (depending on the tank) to get it.

TL;DR: Good game, varied gameplay, but some tanks make it very P2W"

also i Recomment SU-100Y this tank will make you a good money its also have 130mm gun that will anihilate every thing by it's 400 alpha damage with more damage premiums round with about 490 alpha damage that will goes up to 500 will almost kill tier 5 full health and lick up tier 7 health 1/4 of pretty much every tank in that tier and that's all my review tank's gun stats this is my first comment in steam hope fully it would be worth

plz help"

6385,This game is similar to 99% of other free games - full of noobs and bots that either stay afk from start to finish after joining a battle or hit enemy armor which barely does any damage or doesn't do any at all. Basically every battle is a lottery and the team with less bots and noobs wins 90% of the time. Might as well play slot machines for virtual money. I suggest everyone to stay away from this lame imitation of a game and instead pick something normal that costs money to play because WoTB is nothing but a frustration fest. I recommend this garbage to masochists only :P
6386,"It used to be a great game, until they ruined the game by destroying low tier, and adding a bunch of fake tanks. They have made it some pay too win mess where you have to keep paying to not lose credits and crap. I used to love this game, but they killed it."
6387,GFG
6388,gooooooooot
6389,"I am going to outright say that WoTB is one of the most fun games I've ever played, I have been playing for roughly 4 years, and it is still so much fun!

For any newcomers, WoTB is relatively simple, you have to kill enemy tanks in random, online battles, make your tank better, get better tanks, etc. Its a fun game. But unlike most players, I enjoy the unrealistic play style, unlike tanks games like War Thunder or WoT PC, WoTB has very balanced tanks that make the game fun! Each tank has 4 basic performance categories: speed, armor, gun, and health. And each tank having at least 1 of the 4 as really good, barring a few. It makes tanks like the T49 have a chance against the VK100.01P. You don't feel like the tank you have sucks, and that is really good.

The main problem I have with this game is suspension. War Thunder, WoT PC, and even smaller games all have smooth, working suspensions on their tanks. While WoTB tanks feels like a weaponized wagon, stiff, no spring to it, and you can get stuck easier. And I have seen some small, mainly mobile based tank games have flawless suspensions, so you can do it too.

Other than that, it really is a fun game, 9/10"
6390,"pay to win
"
6391,"100% pay to play. Just trust me. You don't even verse real players until you get a really, really good tank, which unless you're ready to grind against bots, it'll take a while to get.

6447,"an arcadey and simple WW2 tank game. it has a tech tree system like other Wargaming titles, and operate similiarly. you will be encountering a lot of grinding if you intend to reach higher tiers such as T8-T10, but overall a great free title."
6448,NO
6449,WOT Blitz is a highly contrived meta environment where you face up against an enemy team which may defeat you based on meta data.
6450,11/9 IGN LUL
6451,shit
6452,"Good game
"
6453,"It has tanks. They go kaboom. Sometimes they shoot and others go kaboom.

Overall a nice 7/10 has the best story I’ve ever seen in a game but the Panzer arc was a little bit flat."
6454,"Many people call the game pay to win but the truth is there are only two tanks that are pay to win, the annihilator and smasher. Both of which are tier 7 so its not a big deal seeing that the game caps at tier 10. Yes the game is a grind and you can buy your way up the tiers, but having high tier tanks doesn't make you better. Players who buy their way up right away end up getting ripped apart by the experienced players who learned the game while progressing normally. Basically what i am saying is take your time learning the game, buying your way up the tiers will only make the game harder as you will face better players in equally good tanks. 

Overall I rate the game 9.2/10"
6455,Haha tank booom boom brrrrrrrr
6456,"my pc can't run War Thunder ,so i play this game instead ."
6457,i guess its alright if they made the destruction of tanks more realistic i would recommend
6458,"Great for passing free time!

6459,really fun game just a small community!
6460,great game
6461,its the perfect game
6462,shit
6463,This game is really nice with the T29 im rocking these battles!
6464,fun
6465,the game was once good but with all of the pay to win tanks it has gone to shit and with the rng its almost impossible to play anything that was one good to all the new players stay away until the devs fix all of the major problems
6466,"Like all MMOs, this eventually gets boring. Because this is a ""Free to play"" game, you also hit the grind wall really fast."
6467,reeeeeeeeee
6468,pretty good game but lots of noobs
6469,best game because its free with so good driving and looking good love this game
6470,this game doesnt eat baklava
6471,"Ok so a few words about this game:

Positive:
If you like to collect tanks go for it it has tons of tanks and they are adding a lot of new ones.
Graphics are prettys good for a mobile game
You find games pretty fast and you unluck tanks faster than ín the normal version
The way you get ranked points isnt that bad because you get more points on how YOU performed in the game and not your team

What I freakin hate about it:
Premium everything has to be freakin premium. And with that I dont mean there are a few premium tanks that you can buy for every nation no I mean the ton of premium tanks they had to add with lootboxes and events where you have to buy a pass to even get the chance to collect them. Oh yeah and the chances of even collecting one of the tanks you have to buy boxes worth of hundreds of bucks. Whats even more frustrating is that you could get the first special premium back in 2015 which got a special name that ppl can see you got it in 2015 and ngl back than it was pretty cool because it showed you played back in the days but then it happened: For 2016 and later years you could still get this tank because it came back into the shop, but not with the name of the current year, no, it still got the 2015 so ppl spent like abnout 30 bucks just to get a tank you could get every year again and they do this with all the ""limited/special/seasonal"" tanks they just resell it over and over again.

Another point is that you can play ranked for 1 or 2 years now and when it came out it was a good idea and actually made a lot of fun. A bit of side info about this: in ranked you have to play a Tier 7-10 tank which is normally pretty high and you get to understand the game until you get there. But now the problem, you can get so many premium tanks and a lot of TIER X too, which is the highest tier, so that now you get tons of ppl who get a new acc throw out their money and play ranked with a tank that is the highest Tier but they have no idea how the game works. Oh and ofc most of these premium Tier X tanks are bit unbalanced compared to the normal ones. So people grind for hundreds of hours just to see their Tier X tank completly ""outplayed"" by the kiddo that spend hundreds of bucks to get this rng Tier X tank.

Another very frustrating topic is the matchmaking itself and with that I mean the tank types and on which map you going to play. First of all there are different kind of maps: small ones, cities, big and open ones and some mediums which are a bit mixerd. Now imagine you want to play your heavy tank in ranked you queue in and get on an open big map in which you have to capture bases. Then you go in and play your best until its a 1v1 and see there is a light tank as your opponent. Normally you would think hey I got this he may be faster than me but I got this when I position myself good. But now there is the problem: the light tank can basically give a fuck about you and just capture all bases because in the time you get to even one base he can capture all the others. Light tanks in this game are so fast that you could basically go afk in a 1v1 against them because you will lose anyways.

And with the last part we get to the tank balancing:
Back in the days only the most basic tanks from the original game where in this game so every high tier tank had a single shot gun and pretty balanced dps: so the guns with high dmg need a lot longer to reload than the ones that do less. But then a few years ago they started to implement the guns from the main game which have a multi loaded magazine so they can shoot like 5 rounds with 1 sec in between and then have to reload like 15-20 sec and in the main game these guns make sense I guess but in this Blitz version definitely not. Then you could say hey 20 sec to reload a magazine is a lot of time so then you can destroy him right? NOPE most high tier tanks with a magazine loader just destroy you with a full magazine anyways and then go back the 20s for reload so in the time he hit you 5 times you can hit him once, while he destroys you and you dealt like 400 dmg of his 2k+ hp. 
Back to light tanks (or fast tanks in general): the tank itself isnt broken in my opinion its just their vision range especially on smaller maps. I try to prove it by going with my Dracula (yes they made a tank called like that) he is a Tier 7 premium tank which can drive at like 55km/h (or more depending on different aspects) and it took me on a small map about 4.6 seconds to scout their COMPLETE team so my team knew after 4.6 seconds where all of their tanks are and could destroy them, while the enemy team only knew where I was (1 out of 7 tanks per team) while getting completely destroyed out of nowhere. Sounds fair right? Now you could say well they would need such a tank too well yeah but welcome to WoTB matchmaking because they didn't. Oh yeah and matchmaking sometimes thinks it has to put all the high dmg Tankdestroyers in one team and the low dmg mediums in the other so the tankdestroyer could just oneshot all of them one by one.

There is tons of stuff more about the game that kinda pisses me off but I dont want to make this review even longer so these are the most important topics.

All my rant in a little conclusion:
- Too much moneymaking with lootboxes and copy paste premium tanks
- stupid matchmaking
- community is complete crap (no game without one or more kiddos crying in all chat)
- remove all these overpowered new guns or balance them(premium and non premium)
- stop reminding me that I should buy all the premium crap that a random generator finds in the shop
- Everything has to be premium cus premium is premium and premium is great. Did I already say premium?

I am going to uninstall the game now and well we will see maybe I come back in a year to either see it getting better or so even more COMPLETELY needless new Premium stuff. Hope my review helped!

6479,"This is better than the original game. It doesn't require a good PC, it has a huge variety of tanks, and is a slowly-progressing skill-based game, I chose the Soviets and went up to the T-34-85, which is a good tank for new players. I haven't played for the longest time, but if you are deciding whether or not the storage of the game is worth it (because there isn't any other reason not to download this) then it definitely is. Thank you Wargaming.net for this amazing game for Steam users!"

6490,hello my name is Clarktoons and i wanna talk to you about the sponser of todays video world of tanks is a fun online game where you can get hundreds of different tanks and kill other people its great. ive played 169 hours of this game in the past week and i love it.
6491,The game is really fun to play and u can spend some time in it without regreting!
6492,I love this game.
6493,"Ugh, were to start.  

The graphics are good circa 2010.

The game is easy to pickup for basic playing, but just not worth it to master.  As, for all Wargaming.net games everything is convoluted and riddled with management.

As with WG games THE UP SELLING IS CRAZY!  Popups in game and constant pushing you to part with your money.  Even more so than WG's World of Warships game.  They really need to get a clue that the nickel and dime game model isn't for PC or console gaming, you might be able to pull it off on mobile games (lots fools there willing to part from their money, just look at Castle Clash).  This model is not liked in PC gaming at all just look at how well Star Wars Battlefront pay for loot box scheme ticked off the player base.

The game is very pay-to-win, Yeah sure you can play for free as developers claim.  But, you are at a large disadvantage compared to those taken in and have spent hard earned cash on this dumpster fire.

Playing above Tier 4 you will find the pay-to-play very apparent in the game.  You will be matched up against much better players in maxed out tanks and equipment vs your basic run of the mill tank used for target practice by them.  

The mechanics in the game are very rudimentary too.

6503,"Do you like world of tanks?

Do you have a dogshit PC or laptop or - perhaps - some other console? Hell, do you only have a phone, or are a forty-something who's children gifted you an iPad? Have you tried to play World of Tanks but the interface and gameplay was too confusing and demanded too much of you?

Then try World of Tanks Blitz. It's the same but with shittier graphics and about half the actual content to ease processing requirements so if you tried hard enough you could probably run this on a potato battery with a raspberry Pi. Are the developers still moneysucking ghouls who will gladly drain your bank account of any and everything you have? yep! Do they give even the slightest fuck about historical accuracy? Nope! Is it overall a watered down version of the original that caps out at 100 FPS? oh, definitely!

Come try world of tanks blitz. it's the lite version of a PC game for plebs who aren't ready yet."
6504,very nice game but there is some bug
6505,"I recommend this game because for me, its addictive and fun but, the only downside to this game is its matchmaking and its microtransactions."

One match you win a landslide and the next you could be destroyed in one hit by a pistol - of course that's an exaggeration but it's how it feels.

Let's be honest, I wrote this review for the Steam Awards."
6575,"TLDR
This game is very fun and frustating at the sametime as you can sometime have uncooperative teammate or straightup troll just to make it worst. The mechanics of the rng is the game changer here as you can skmetimes oneshot people and send them to the garage instantly. Premium tanks sometime is OP but usualy the one who used it have no skill at the game. Event is usual f2p game grind to get or empty your walllet but the reward is usaly an op tank. Nice game overall except in asia that somehow have one of the worst server.

6583,"played for a year . game is not balanced at all . tanks look cool and play well but just be prepared to faceroll your keyboard when you see how they match new players with less than 100 matches in experience , against players with 50k matches . until it is fixed i will not recommend this game.8/21update : played for nearly 2 yrs now , game still unbalanced with matches , still tons of ghost shells , still dont recommend it . lately has been really geared to asking you for money . most ""improvements"" in the game are menu and UI to make buying menus even bigger and the load in to the game usually has 2 advertisements now .update 12-21 . game still broken and i still dont recommend it . it is broken ."
6584,"In this game, the developers have made help for people who do not know how to play well, and basically these people who help them play against you, you shoot at the sides and have to pierce, but the damage does not pass, or when you completely aim at the tank, the projectile flies into the ground. and there are a lot of such moments !!! the developers deny everything, but I am 100% sure that this is the case"
6585,"Would not recommend, the grind is to high after tier 5"

6601,"Generally a good game for some decent fun, worth to pick up if you just want to chill!
Not recommended if you want to play a bit more competitive, in which the paying customer has a benefit. Also matchmaking is quite bad, half the time someone is AFK, the other half you are up against a team with average 50-60% Win Rate while your own team has avg 40-45 Win Rate(meaning your team will shoot the wall or each other, and you just can't 1v7), why???"
6602,"great game. nothing else to say. lacks reality at times but that isnt necessarily a bad thing,because it gives you a break from reality"
6603,dude dis game is awsom u can snipe people

6608,guud
6609,This is a bad game. It starts off bad right from the start. The tutorial is painfully slow. The tanks are slow and have way too much hp for how weak all the tanks are and it is painfully slow to fight in a match. The over the shoulder view is not immersive. The research tree is not intuitive. The free crate feature is set up to make you think you can open more only to spend your credits if you click again and there is no confirmation to ask if you want to spend credits. The game is also a shameless cash grab at every single turn begging for your money with poorly implemented dlc and boosts. If you are following a curator that recommends this consider unfollowing them before they recommend more wastes of your time.
6610,The game went to crap. Not worth playing anymore. I wasted so much money i could have bought myself a car.
6611,game sucks the life out of you
6612,"i like this game
"
6613,"this is not a game but a piece of shit, the game was released in 2014 and added to Steam in 2016 and during this time the developers could not add a normal tank backing algorithm!

6614,I like it
6615,"After having played 40k+ games on mobile, windows 10 and steam across 2 different servers, it just boils down to these 2 problems. 

1. All tiers under 8 are now pay to win. The balancing has just gone out the window. It's only a fair fight when you get to tier 9 or 10. 

2. The community is full of toxic immature people, who will get butthurt and salty on just about anything.  Even at higher levels of gameplay or in the competitive field, it doesn't get any better. It's hard to find a more egotistic and arrogant playerbase than the so called 'unicums' (experienced/highly skilled players) of wot blitz."

People are really toxic and for the most part there are a ton of bots in the game. You could spend thousands of dollars and still not even scratch the surface of unlocking most of the stuff in game. There is so much RNG that skill really only matters on heavy tanks where you can maybe bounce a shot if your angle is right. People AFK bot just to get the XP constantly while they are at work or school. So most games you will have people who never move. The controls are for mobile and very annoying. 

This is a classic example of greed ruining a good thing. This game is 100 percent pay to win maybe if RNG is on your side."

p/s: play from 2014 on mobile"
6640,"Don't be like me where I've already wasted many hours upon years and years with this game. (In fact I've wasted 60~ hours in 3 weeks at the time of the review)

This is just a mobile port, to PC of World Of Tanks, having smaller maps and condensed tech trees and 7 v 7 battles. The game itself is grindy but can be fun at times, I've had fun grinding certain tanks at higher tiers.

The problem lies with the community and the implementation of what is free and what do you need to pay for.

Ever since May of 2020, there have been battle passes, which is a pretty big sign that the best rewards are paid for, they come monthly and some rewards are good but if you want the collector tanks, time to open up that wallet of yours. 

There are also stupidly overpowered premium tanks that you can only get your hands on by paying money, hence the term ""pay to win"". Even the crates to get certain tanks require the premium currency, in which costs gold, but as well as you get a ""chance"" to get the tank, implementing paid gacha mechanics. This causes as well for their matchmaking to be really bad, and unfair at times, even they have removed the lower tier battle restrictions when you buy a new tank so you're at a disadvantage if that ever happens to you.

In terms of the community, there can be really good fellows in matches here and there, gives you a good chuckle. But the majority wants you to die and calls you useless or an idiot, very demoralising for the whole team just wanting to have a good match.

Nobody agrees with nobody from what it seems, and the whole game is a mess until they fix the most important things that the community suggests.

Like most F2P P2W games, please avoid the hellhole if possible."

6652,"This game is very good for people who want to know about world war ll. It's also quite a good pg game that involves shooting stuff although I'm not sure how that's possible.Still I would highly recommend this game as it's a really fun game to play! Tip: Don't spend all your gold at once, it's hard to get back. It also runs with minimal lag spikes even with a bad pc"

6661,"Its good, some people say the more you play the more it gets boring, for me it is not. It is just ones opinion, we have ourselves, try it yourself."

6669,"You can play for a short time if you wish!  So you can dip in and out of game no requirement to have to come on and play as you lose months of hard work if you do not.  So great one game takes around 10 mins with log in etc and if you wish that is all you have to play, no superfast reactions required like some fps.  Would like terrain to be interchageable to stop the guys that spend their life on here so they know all the best positions very ahistoric nobody knew the ground that well before they fought on it."

I would prefer to choose my own maps for playing. However this is not possible , so , never mind. Apart from that I strongly

6701,"Upside : 
Good game and fun to play. Coz it's Blitz and takes only ~7 min per engagement. 
Started out on free to play and I started buying play time after a couple of days.

Downside :
1. Uneven matching of player makes it hard for ppl wanting to get tanks higher than tier VI tanks.
2. Unfair & stupid points systems; e.g. I had a tier VI tank , killed 2 enemy's tanks scored ~900 damages and lost 1,2000 credits at the end. Explain that ! - this happens to me regularly with all my tier VI's  - VK28  and T34-85. I also have a tier VII LTTB. Stop playing that coz eventually I will run out of credit.

6717,"Elsőnek is, a kurva anyját a War Gaming-nak/nek. Letöltöttem ezt a szutykot aztán gondoltam egyet és letöltöttem a sima WoT-ot aztán vissza tértem erre a szutyokra, és minden tankom eltűnt, újra kell kezdenem mindent. mivel 117 órám van van tapasztalatom ebben a szutyok szarban, sorolom a legfőbb problémáit:
-PayToWin
-Mindig a pofádba bassz 510151235 Tank reklámot hogy fizessél a szar játékuknak
-Annyira kevés a játékos ezen a szaron (mondjuk értem miért) hogy mikor VI Tankos voltam és nem volt ritka az hogy VII Tankokhoz baszott be és csak én voltam a VI tank.
-Fizika 0
-Grafika ""High""-on ugyan olyan mint ha levennéd ""Low""-ra 
Vannak jó dolgai is:
-Van tank
-Lehet Multiplayerbe is tolni
azt ennyi. mondjuk eleve elárul mindent hogy a max FPS limit az 60 XDDD a rendszerváltáskor már kiment a divatból a 60 Fps limit XDDD aki meg telefonról akarja nyomni ezt a szutykot annak ajánlom hogy ne kezdje el a játékot. Néha vannak frissítések, de azok csak annyiból állnak hogy: pár ""bug"" fixálás, és prémium fizetős tankok. Csak rosszat tudok kivánni a War Gaming-nek. Köszönöm ezt a felesleges, szar 117 órát :)"

6735,"Game of oppression of the year.
This game has the worst team matches of all games.
Has software called RNG This part of the game decides your shots worth. (#1 worst part of game)
(RNG) can completely take you out of the game by making all your shots worthless. 
Meaning shots disappear, shots hit tanks tracks (says damaged, but no damage) Shots go into ground way off target, tank sights take absurd time to come together without reason.(outside of normal closing time)
#2 Worst part of the game. The ' Toxic Teams ' you will get teams of no tank skilled players all through the tiers, It don't get better.
(AFK PLAYERS) You will experience many games of up 4 afk players in a match. left to face the other team with 4 team members than the 7 you are permitted.(many times they are the top tanks)

If you don't want to have your day completely trashed for being angry for nothing. Then don't play this."

WOT BLiTZ are now give you a match making with only just 2 out of 10 matches you able to win. you will suffer in hell of trash players and teammates with less than 500 of making damage.

*** Still not recommended. I regret spending money on this game

IMPORTANT UPDATE 7.7!!!!

With 60% win rate and above the system will put you below average players 50% to play with. 

WOW so fun ! You will experienced AFK people and no clue people playing.

- low tier is fun
- high tier with bullsh*t matchmaking/lots of afks

6793,"I've played this game from 2017 with 1.5 years long break from 2018-2019. My first game after the break was really frustrating. There was too many OP tanks either it's premium or collectible. The match making even worse. I'm wondering if a monke run the match making algorithm.
If you live in developing country with minimum wage, please control your money management. This game is a blackhole for your wallet. Especially with the stupid crates that supposed to ""reduce the amount of premium tanks"".
Besides all of this negative things, if you can found a decent match this game is really enjoyable."

6795,"Game has toxic players, but I'm having a lot of fun, especially for the fact that it's free! It's definitely less toxic than World of Tanks, and if you're tired of higher tiers, you can always just hop onto a Pz. lll and drop a thermonuclear bomb on everybody. Seriously, the Pz. lll is a really good medium tank. It's mobile, has good armor, good reload speed, and deals good amounts of damage (120 was the most high roll I've ever gotten).

Edit 1: I also recommend that you go down the Chinese line to the WZ-121, there are some insane tanks along the way, like the Type T-34 with its insane DPM and reload speed, Type 58 with its absolutely troll turret (looks pennable from the front, but it just absorbs every shot), and the T-34-1 with it's high damage gun and insane turret that can block a shot from the SU-152 Derp Gun. Seriously, you gotta go for it, these tanks are really fun, especially the T-34-1. I also recommend that you play in a platoon over a call because that's when you get the most fun out of the game.

Edit 2: terrible fucking shit ass rng terrible matchmaking terrible everything, couple months off, nothing changed never again even though i know i'll come back to this later for torture

Edit 3: the game is ok, the rng sometimes screws you over and sometimes it doesnt, if it doesnt you'll have a great day, if it does, just dont play for a few hours and then come back, and so on. one thing to remember is to not give in to corporate greed and pay them money for premium and gold and stuff. just dont. if you want to you can get the game, just remember, get the soviet death fridge, it will give you some amazing kills because russian bias. have a good day, i keep returning to this game for no reason, 187.8 hours is not something you can really get if you dont come back

TLDR: game is good, dont pay wg, go for soviet death fridge, dont continue playing if rng is bad, return to the game a few hours later for another round, etc., read latest edit for overview.

Edit 4: all i know is suffering"
6796,"this game is amazing and it shows how a great plan can result in victory even though the game lacks in graphics it responds with historical wepon such as , TIGER 1,  the churchill and the M4 sherman which all good in the games case

this does have a big amout of competeters such as warthunder and games like hell let loose 

i do advise getting world of tanks or the other games i have listed   thank you for listening"

6802,"It's a pretty good game, it takes a bit to adjust too but as long as you have common sense and can coordinate well it's pretty fun! My only complaint is how much paying there is and how it shoves it in your face sometimes. But luckily it's not pay-to-win. I would recommend it for people who like a more realistic feel to a tank game and like major changes."

There will be those who say it's not, but for free to play players in particular it's a crap shot at best more than 50 to 70% of the time. From nerfing tanks to unfair match ups, and some cheating quite obviously being used I would not recommend taking on this game if you are a heavy free to play gamer. It's worth a casual play at best if you're bored and don't want to play solitaire, and don't mind losing."
6819,great game!
6820,This shit is worse than a mobile game. Whoever is responsible for monetization in this game deserves having their nails ripped off with a rusty spoon.
6821,Great fun from the start
6822,Platoon size can only be 2. That is a show stopper.
6823,It runs smoothly at 60+ FPS on my GT 1030. Easier to run than the full game.
6824,это игра моя любимая
6825,so this game is free well don't think so buddy because it limits you and always wants you to buy premium or gold and is really making me sick as a child I hated this and still I hated it just pushes the player to buy stuff instead of this go play war thunder its a lot better and doesn't require money for extra space in your garage of course it is like 39 gb but a lot better than this crap so if you have a potato computer and the courage to deny this game's greedy side play it but in my case I won't there is one good thing its not hard to get tanks unlike in war thunder where it tooks like a 1000 matches to even unlock a cold war tank but it does require skill and partly not pay to win so dislike
6826,its a nice game
6827,i like it
6828,i like this game. This version doest have altryrely
6829,so cool game i am recomending it for you

6831,the graphics are not that good but all in all it is great
6832,THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!DOWNLOAD IT!

6834,its the crappy mobile version instead of the actual game
6835,"its nice for the most part. your average game company tactics though, try and force your hand to spend money somewhere in the game. mostly by making late game grinds extremely slow. but theres also the point where they dont do much to hackers/cheaters to force you to spend money to get stronger than normal tanks and put your cc in for buying premium ammo"
6836,good
6837,"It's fine.  It runs on my old potato of a computer with minimal problems.  Watch some videos on youtube to learn how to play your specific role in battle, if you're just starting up."
6838,"Created an account and played for a few hours, really enjoyed the game. Then i heard about their Veteran program so i signed up for that and went to log back into the game only to find that i can't join into the servers anymore ( tried logging in a few times a day over the past week). Contacted support and explained everything only for them to tell me to change my internet provider..... My service is 900mb up and 900mb down (which i told them before they said to change my provider)... it's not my internet. Plus i created another account not linked to the Veteran program and it logs in with no issues........ Why offer a veteran program if it makes accounts inaccessible? Atleast it happened early on before i sunk a bunch of time into it only to lose everything."

6847,101% BEST TANK GAME FOR STEAM USERS
6848,awesome game
6849,"it is good
"
6850,"This game isn't a bad game. It takes a bit of skill, so practice playing lower tiers to improve your gameplay before moving to higher tiers. I see so many noobs at higher tiers that lets the team down, causing a unnecessary loss. That said, if you just want to play this game for fun, go ahead, but try to improve your skill and carry your weight. Otherwise you will get reported and raged upon. 

Good points
- F2p players can still do well in this game. 
- Mainly a pay to progress game, not pay to win game
- You can buy some premium tanks with gold, which you can earn for free, but only a small amount to help you grind credits since premium tanks makes more credits than regular tanks
- Helpful community
- Large and diverse number of tanks

Bad points
- Some premium tanks are very broken
- Game can be quite toxic sometimes
- For regular battles, you can have a team full of noobs against a team full of pros, that said, if you want to play balanced matchmaking, go play ratings. 
- Tier 10 tanks have doesn't make credits, you will mostly lose credits if you play in higher tiers, so it can be unsustainable to play without a premium tank
- Some tiers are just broken, like tier 7 where there is a lot of op premium tanks"
6851,Love it!
6852,koks gra twurco
6853,"it's an ok game, but the ONLY thing it has over WT is that on councle is that WoT has arty tanks. other than that, WT is superior in every way, such as overall vehicles, the ammo types, the fact that you can have tanks and planes in the same battle, and more. War Thunder is a better game in basically every way. EVEN THE DAMAGE IS BETTER. YOU DON'T NEED TO DETECT THE ENEMY TO ATTACK THEM IN WT, YOU JUST NEED TO SEE OH HEY, A TANK THAT DOESN'T HAVE A BLUE TAG ABOVE IT, AN ENEMY!"
6854,"i play wot pc and thought itd be fun to try something different..... way too easy for an experienced player like myself, had a tier 8 tank within a day of playing, a LOT less rigged than normal wot. WG FIX PLS"
6855,I have played war commander for 6 yrs and it's nothing like this game so happy I found it. enemy can not run and hide like in war commander your upgrades xp come from battles love it here

6859,this game sucks
6860,Good game other than the balancing issues with the lavel 7 anihilator which is currently overbuffed to the point of stopping newer player from moving up the tech tree and quiting the game instead.
6861,"It used to be a good game... it still kind of is but honestly, now its just horrible. The team balancing is crap, there are so many overpowered tanks that people can get so easily at the cost of their money, there are trolls that either do nothing or block the easiest target on their team, trying their best to make their team lose. Not to mention its so difficult to progress through a normal tech tree without using free XP or boosters, forcing you to spend money to get it easier. I hope this game changes one day so It can be good again, but for now its pretty bad. And to go along with the horrible team balancing, teams themselves are just filled with people who don't know how to play, that or they do bad on purpose. There's also a bunch of toxic people that spam slurs like the N-Word. Please, fix this game Wargaming. The Game is near unplayable because of all these issues"
6862,very good
6863,Game is Pay To Win (P2W) and forces you on every step to buy premium content for real money. Mechanics is quite decent but game seems to be rather mundane.

6872,This game is cool
6873,Good simple fun
6874,"This is an amazing game with great controls that are easy to learn.
You learn so much about tanks (I should know) and what impact they had in history.
The best things that are in the game would have to be the information given about a tank, how real they look and how you can bond with the community.
I would 100% recommend getting this game

6875,Good game
6876,It would be fun if I knew how it is controlled!

6890,"World of Tanks Blitz is a great game if you are looking for a simplified version of World of Tanks. If you want a more casual experience, this is for you. This is the mobile version of World of Tanks but cross with PC and recently, Nintendo Switch. Gameplay is super simple, and matches only go for about up to 7 minutes, so it's great to pick up and play if you only have small amounts of time to play. The only major drawback is, being free to play, it does try to constantly put premium items in your face. Luckily I can say, it is very possible to play for free without issue. The only thing I recommend if you did decide to drop money, upgrading to a Premium account is helpful as it awards bonus XP and other rewards. 

Overall if you are looking for a casual World of Tanks experience, this is it. And since its cross platform, you can play it on the go too by linking your account to the phone and/or Switch version. I strongly recommend this for a casual, easier experience than the official World of Tanks. If you want a greater challenge, and/or larger scale battles and such, I recommend the full PC version from Wargaming."

6892,"Just a warning, but all the players are brain dead. The RNG will always find a way to shoot at the sliver of crosshair that isn't on the enemy tank."
6893,"Absolute garbag, fix the machmaking"
6894,"Great game, high skill cap, people like to complain about matchmaking but those people tend to be kinda shit at the game so that explains all you need to know about them. All in all a fun game, lots of grinding and not something you will be 100%ing anytime soon."
6895, great  arcade style game
6896,yes
6897,Don't get this game you will never stop playing it!
6898,Shity game match balance is so mismaching that you always playing againt stronger player than you always on 20 lost get 1 or 2 win and again you geting chain of lost battles.
6899,The game is money based as most games of a certain age.Remember spend to win.
6900,"cuz its fucking sucks

6901,"Super fun and realistic!
I like it how you can earn preinum for a short time without having to spend money on the game."
6902,"Mobile version of WoT. Somehow its better cuz better balanced, no camping in 90% battles, and u have few original tanks what WoT doesn't have. Very good game (not for fun)."

For me, his game has never failed to excite and i have been playing for a few years now and never once thought of uninstalling it. There are no bugs, no all-of-a-sudden need to restart the game, unless of course there is no internet. All in all, this game is fun for all kind of players. It is action-packed and is never going to bore you. I would recommend it to anyone. If you are looking for a war game right now, give World of Tanks a shot, because believe me, you will not regret it."

6928,This game is quick and easy to learn. I enjoy many hours playing in every one of my tanks.
6929,"World of Tanks Blitz is the mobile version of the famous world of tanks game. Blitz is practically a lite version, that I sincerely believe is more enjoyable, the battles are epic and full of action, this game is a completely free game.

At it’s core, Blitz is the “Action Tank Commander” game, allowing players to set missions, research, and carry out an attack on the enemy. A more immersive and challenging game, you can expect to run into players who can get really aggressive in battle, launching all sort of missiles and bullets at you. In the case that you are lacking in tanks and cannot obtain one, you can farm them to make a challenge against other players.

Since Blitz has a steep learning curve, I can recommend it for the more advanced tank players.

It’s an incredibly fast game, you will get quickly frustrated by the seemingly endless difficulty level, that only makes it harder and harder. But remember, you only have 24 hours to complete a mission, a faster pace makes the game more enjoyable and challenging.

Anyway, it seems pretty fresh, great graphics and speed, but the only problem I have with it is, that the game doesn’t feel polished and “finished”, the tutorial is not very good, and as such, one needs to spend a while to unlock every class (my guess is because the developers wanted to release Blitz simultaneously with the World of Tanks 2). In any case, Blitz is a cool and short game, perfect for the mobile platforms, just don’t expect an immersive “coop experience” as you do in the real World of Tanks game.

It’s a well-polished and quality game, but you have to spend a lot of time to unlock it and enjoy it.

I wish you a really fun time playing this and more successful times."
6930,very fun pvp online . it's a team game
6931,Game is alot of fun! I came from the regular PC version and I like Blitz better. Battles are faster and one person can much more of an influence on the battle outcome than regular WoT. Give it a shot I dont think you will be disappointed!!
6932,"problem with steam account. I have 2 Steam accounts. I have a persistent problem after every Steam update I can't login to my main account. You could eventually do something about it every time I trace a few hours to recover my original account. After 2 games delivered 3 Heroses of the magician only worked 2 hours, I paid for it and the steam sold me, I do not want to help or return the money. So why do I buy something that breaks down?"

6935,Tried everything over the years with this game on other steam accounts. It's just an autistic simulator that will make you self-quit each time you waste money. Purely about selling crates and there's no australian server for reasonable ping.

6937,"Great Shoot'em up with tons of enjoyment and endless multiplayer gaming.
Although someone can buy better equipment and upgrades, still, if you have the skill you can enjoy epic moments!"

Mach dich auf Pro-oder Fungaming gefasst
Ich spiele dieses Spiel schon seit ein paar Jährchen und habe es immer noch nicht satt. Es gibt immer wieder neue combat-zones und Panzer. Es entwickeln sich immer wieder neue Kampfstrategien. Während des Gameplay verliert man wegen des hohen Suchtpotenziales gerne auch mal die Zeit aus den Augen. Ich bin froh das es dieses Spiel gibt. Man kann mit anderen Playern fachsimpeln, sich aufregen, neue Taktiken entwerfen und sehr, sehr, viel lachen und schmunzeln. Es ist offiziell free-to-play aber es gibt doch viele Sachen die man nur kaufen kann. Allerdings ist es nicht zwingend nötig bei dem Spiel Geld auszugeben, denn alles was man braucht kann man sich erspielen. Die meisten ""Etras"" sind mit etwas Geduld auch ohne Einzahlung zu erreichen. Äußerst kurzweiliges Spiel. Tolle, interessante Game-Modi werden neben den drei Grundmodi Begegnungsgefecht (1 Basis); Herrschaft ( 3 Basen);, Wertungsgefecht (Einstufung der Leistung) immer wieder zeitweilig hinzugefügt. Dankeschön an wargaming.net. Ihr habt einen Meilenstein in der Panzerspielgeschichte gesetzt.

WORLD of TANKS BLITZ !!!
Get ready for pro or fungaming
I've been playing this game for a few years and I'm still not fed up. There are always new combat zones and tanks. New combat strategies keep evolving. During the gameplay, you like to lose sight of time because of the high addictive potential. I'm glad there's this game. You can talk to other players, get upset, design new tactics and laugh and smile very, very, much. It's officially free-to-play but there are a lot of things you can only buy. However, it is not absolutely necessary to spend money on the game, because everything you need can be won. Most ""Etras"" can be reached with a little patience even without a deposit. Extremely entertaining game. Great, interesting game modes will be in addition to the three basic modes Encounter Battle (1 base); Domination ( 3 bases); scoring battle (performance rating) is added again and again temporarily. Thank you to wargaming.net. You have set a milestone in tank game history.

6948,fun and easy to run
6949,"If you don't like Tanks and quick gameplay, this isn't for you.
OFC it's PaytoWin, but if you're reasonably skilled and use the different tankclasses in the right way , its easy to grind through. Also theres daily crates and many events. If you got a light tank, it's like NeedforSpeed with Turrets."
6950,good game
6951,lll
6952,"I've played this game for around 3-4 years (I have only just started on PC), and its safe to say it has progressed really far. Game runs great, aside from several lag spikes. Over the years, it really has become a lot more P2P and sometimes even P2W, especially with the increasing amount of crates with extremely low drop rates. For as long as I have played this game I have only gotten 1 tank drop, with majority of the drops being credits or boosters. aside from that, I really enjoy this game (watch out for toxic kids, there are far too many). 

Final verdict: 7/10, can't reach 120fps for some reason regardless of graphics setting lol."
6953,"Incredibly fun and unique shooter. I've never played a game like this, and I can't get enough of it."

the only thing i want for this game is controller support"

6956,"Can be a fun diversion on your phone or a potato laptop, but make no mistake, it is a full-on money-printing dopamine abuser that has no interest in actually being fun; what fun there is seems to be either left-over or coincidence."
6957,"I like it.
Is my most played game.
Have many op tanks but if you are a good tanker a you know how to play and move on the maps you will win.
"
6958,"This game is just great. You have tanks back in the world wars. Highly realistic, Some people could be toxic sometimes at some points. And you can play some custom matches,( my favorite because i can lead a one man army). Although this game is not that violent. the only things you might find violent is shooting and destroying other players tanks. witch i don't know why you will find that violent. this game has slightly worse graphics than the desktop only world of tanks. but however it is still a good game."
6959,good game
6960,Tanks go boom
6961,fix the win rate match making! one team is above 60% and the other 40% a bad joke!
6962,veri nais
6963,"Easier to get into and quicker to play than World of Tanks although not as strategic. Keep in mind this game was made quite some years ago and has to be playable on mobile so the graphics are not insane.
The gameplay itself is very enjoyable and quite easy to get into.
All and all a great game that gets even more fun as you progress through the tiers!"
6964,"dobry,tato hraje kdyz ja makam"
6965,"I personally have a lot of fun playing this game. I would choose it over WoT original PC version because of the fact that the maps are much smaller, and because of that you are almost permanently fighting, and you matter much more than in the other one the battles consisting of only 14 players 7v7. And unlike what others think, there are games in which you have to think about an strategy about where to take the enemy, capture bases, flank, etc. Not only pressing battle and starting to shoot the enemies immediately. The number of games that end in like 2 or 3 minutes have probably increased, but for me personally I get an game in which I carry my team quite frequently, and I have fun playing the game. Aand the premium tanks have made me quit the game a few times but I always end up coming back with an better strategy/ playstyle and could not ruin my fun with the game yet."
6966,"World of Tanks is great for a quick gaming fix, with battles taking less than 10 minutes.
Having so many vehicles to choose from, even at the lowest entry level, makes none stop action possible. Get knocked out in one battle, switch tank and jump right into another battle.
Upgrades and options are plentiful and achievable even without spending money, although it will take a long time to play this way.
Some of the matches seem a little unbalanced, but war is usually that way too, so no gripes from me.
A fun yet challenging game, with great graphics and sound. Oh and FREE, which is never a bad thing.
I have spent a very little cash on the game and enjoy it thoroughly. I highly recommend this game

6971,"Just a side note: I have been playing for 6.1k battles, now I'd like to tell you why wotb is not reccomended.
1- The lack of a proper tutorial and infestation of non experienced players. The game in itself is a great concept, riddiled with noobs, in every battle, you will find someone who barely does any damage, or cannot go into a single engagement without getting killed.
2- The matchmaking, the matchmaking is terrible as you can be paired up with a superb player that knows everything and every feature of the game but my team is usually filled with normal players or players that play like bots.
3- The p2w aspect of the game. WG sell op tanks for crazy prices like the smasher, VK 90, T-22, lycan and obj 252U that basically can literally obliterate anything in their way without much resistance. Most of these tanks have op shells, crazy sloped armor, and a faster firing gun than their tech tree counterparts, for example the Smasher fires at 15s but the KV-2 fires at 20s. 
For these reasons I don't reccomend playing this game."

6981,Fine game
6982,ok
6983,Nice game but addictive as any other.
6984,Best way to learn tank tactical fights. Train here with various other friendly online players then apply those tactics in CoH2 (against some toxic players).
6985,"HORRIBLE GAME, THIS GAME KILLS YOU INSIDE"
6986,"I like this game, its fun and its a good grind. Sure there are some draw backs like the toxic players but try to avoid them. I like WOTB because it is a fun game to play and its fun to play with friends. 
"
6987,Very sweaty and bad game. Not worth spending time in it. Very pay to win! Not worth 1 second in it at alllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll. Makes you rage every second. VERY BAD
6988,"Actually somewhat better than original WoT. Heat-Apcr shells, while they have better penetration the damage is significantly reduced, to make it seem a lot more fair so the gold noobs would have to think in fact either to use them shells or not, in the main game however, apcr deals as much damage as ap while having a lot better stats."
6989,i have nothing to say this game is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fu
6990,"Although the game is somewhat ok and fun, the whole set up is just a money asking machine. The game can be destroyed easily by other players and the mother company could not care less. Not respecting the gamer or the money spend."
6991,Too much grinding but if you get to tier V to tier X than the game is epic. The tank models are awsome and if you really like WW2 you should play this game. Sherman for the win!

Why do tanks even have houses this does not make any sense at all stupid developers!!!! what if it rains all the tanks die?? Guys you  need to hire me i am very good at thinking of tank sleeping spots and tank restaurants please i need the money i have to buy GFuel for gaming
7000,"It's a pretty fun game, I don't exactly believe that paying for tanks and premiums hinders the gameplay in any sort of way because you can still manage to quite easily destroy most premium tanks in tier VIII and VII in a tech tree tank."
7001,Good games
7002,"Great game and fun to play.
Enjoy!"
7003,Very shitty game. Pay to win and good luck with finding decent match making.

7024,game = gucci
7025,good game but if you dont want spend on game it becomes lot harder
7026,It is a fun and enjoyable game. Microtransactions are for sure very prominent. A steep learning curve. Would recommend if you are looking for a grindy and strategic game
7027,This game is very unfair in a lot of ways. As a skilled player I feel oppressed because the system forces me to be less lucky than unskilled players :(
7028,I like every thing about this game
7029,под вазелин пойдет
7030,Nice game
7031,Like the game but some elements of choosing tanks consing.
7032,Fun game
7033,bogus garbage game....dont waste your time...
7034,i refuse to write anything
7035,"It's like this:
The game can be fun as long as your teams isn't too bad at all. The problem is that as the playerbase is growing there are more good and bad people, but the problem is that 80% of the new players are bad and 20% good, and that's a big problem... And that's also because the people that play bad don't have a reason why they should get better, because they could just buy a premium tank for 40€ or whatever and win with it more often because it's just better than the tanks you get for free. But you can also have when your team isn't the worst. And another big problem is premium account. Because if you don't have premium account you just won't get enough credits to keep the tank you have and buy the other one. And that's the reason why so many people just buy premium account (that's for a limited time and then you have to buy it again) because they just earn much more credits. But the good sides are that's it's a nice game and it's also nice to play with other people. And because of that I would recommend this game as long as you know what you're doing. Play this game at your own risk."
7036,If you want to go broke install this game you will never expirence this level of pay to win.
7037,good game .

7041,fun
7042,This game is so fun! You are a tank that can shoot the other team's tanks. You may change your tank by paying stars
7043,ew
7044,Not very good. Developing is poor and slow. Matchmaking is horrendous. Playerbase is slowly declining but fairly stable. Unfortunately can't recommend this game to new players.
7045,Still good.
7046,Its fun i guess.It just takes long to progress.
7047,A rigged game - Winning rate based on tanks you use which is manipulated by War Gaming - so they can sell more premium tanks.
7048,"In generall a great game, however Tiers 6 through 8 have become unplayable, ignoring historical tanks and adding double barrel tanks like the helsing and triple barrel tanks like the annihalator. These tiers have almost become unplayable, since tanks like the dracula are in my opinion with tier 7 a tier too low. I would rather enjoy the historical tanks and modules rather than purging huge chunks of the tech trees but therefore adding premium Tanks which make these tiers unplayable."
7049,"If you are enthusiastic about learning a little bit of history on tanks and their mechanics, it's a game for you. It's a fast paced game that requires strategy and some common sense. I have always liked military games and being a tank commander is pretty cool. I would recommend this game also because of the graphic detail. It's amazing how far we've come from the simple first pong video game. I'm just amazed!"
7050,well its a fun game
7051,"This review won't be brief, but I hope it will give insight to what this game has too offer. :)

Not sure how many hours you'll see on my steam profile under this review, but I've been playing WOT Blitz for over 6 years. I first downloaded it my iPod 5 and grinded it nonstop, and play it from time to time on my iPhone 8. It was one of the first mobile games I really enjoyed, and it had content many other apps didn't have during the time. For a perspective from today; this game has a lot more microtransactions then its actual PC counterpart, the actual WOT game. However, it contains events, tanks and systems that aren't seen in its strictly PC counterpart, and has pretty fun gameplay for a mobile game. 

One of the perks of WOT Blitz that other mobile apps on steam don't have is its [u][b] compatibility with accounts from your phone[/b][/u]. I personally linked my facebook to my account a long time ago, and used it to login here. 
The game has changed somewhat drastically over the years I've played it. Nothing major, but balancing overhauls and changes to the UI were pleasant surprises I came back too after not playing for a while. The game has frequent updates that introduce new tanks, gamemodes, and sometimes even new tech trees to explore. (I remember the release of Japanese and French tanks, they're usually pretty op upon release).
The graphics aren't the best, but they do a better job than games like War robots. The gameplay is simple, it is not nearly as sophisticated as the shrapnel system in War thunder either. The tech tree system should be relatively simple to understand as well, as everything is organized similarly to its PC counterpart. 
If you for some reason read through all of this, thank you! 

TLDR: If you're looking for a mobile game the casually play on pc, and you enjoy interactive games with a grinding aspect with checkpoints and goals, then I personally recommend this."
7052,it's not the best it has room for improvement but on the other hand it's not half bad.

7057,"I hate that no matter what I do, even if I copy someone else the with the exact same tank, modules, ammo, position and movements, my armor is paper while theirs does their job. This gets especially annoying when you have a bigger gun and can't penetrate them, but their little peashooter can penetrate some of the strongest armor in history."
7058,"This game is so fun, you should play this game."
7059,cool game. would recomend to people who enjoy games like cs:go or war thunder
7060,its good performance game but no balance mathmaking and low lvl support
7061,I absolutely love this game! It can be a pay to win game in some aspects but the gameplay is amazing and the way the game is set up is great.
7062,good for retards
7063,I Liked everything about the game.

7065,"Cons: 
-Graphics are quite lackluster, even on highest graphic settings. Granted, this is a mobile port, and graphics are not meant to be all that great because of that.
-You must spend a small amount of money on the game in order to progress down the tech trees.
- This game can easily frustrate you, especially with the Random Number Generator.
- There is a large difference between the casual players and the competitive players. Unlike WoT PC, there are very few players who are ""average"" or ""above average."" Generally, the players will either be casual, downright poor, or are highly competitive, and cannot stand teammates who get to the higher tiers yet cannot pull their own weight in random battles. This creates a somewhat toxic environment sometimes. The simplest solution for this is to disable battle chat.
- There are a number of completely broken tanks which get played nonstop when they are released or put on sale. I would recommend avoiding the tiers that these tanks exist at for a week or so if you want to make any real progress during that time.

Pros:
- There is a wide range of tanks and maps that can be played. 
- This really is a skill based game, with the Random Number Generator rarely screwing you over. Granted, it does happen, but it doesn't really happen all that often. 
- The purchases you can make in this game really are not all that expensive. Especially compared to WoT PC, For $10 you can get a tier 8 premium tank bundled with premium time. You just have to wait for the right deals. 
- The graphics being rather lackluster allow for this game to be played on a very wide range of devices. I originally got into blitz because my old rig could not handle WoT PC after the 1.0 patch hit. 
- This game allows for modding, which allows you to improve your graphics experience if you so choose.
- Most tanks are pretty well balanced, with constant buffs and nerfs to tanks occurring to allow most players to have a good experience. Blitz is certainly better than PC in this regard.
- Blitz takes up far less time than PC does, yet still requires tactical thinking and skill.
- Blitz is cross platform, and your account progress is linked between devices.

Overall, a good game for the casual gamer. If you are looking for extreme realism and graphics.... go play War Thunder. If you want a good time, and would like to progress somewhat quickly, this game just might be for you."
7066,"tl;dr Discount WoT. 

Pretty good if you want the WoT experience watered down to less than five minutes of action and have no time to play the regular one that usually goes for seven to twenty minutes. Good for potato PCs also if your rig cant handle the regular WoT graphics. Also amazingly the ""lemming"" strat works a lot of times here compared to the regular version (unless you're playing encounter). Also no artillery.

Tech tree had a whole lot of shedding unfortunately since the last time i played and the ""discontinued"" tanks went to some premium wall. Kind of a bummer though if you managed to grind the old tech tree tanks you get to keep it. Yay i guess?

Community is a mixed bag. Sometimes you get trash talker kids that talk smack and throw slurs around, sometimes gentlemen that greet you and ask where to go. Also I rarely see asian clans that are open and/or active. 

Absolutely avoid if you're allergic to free to play UI. The main screen has devolved into that ever since."
7067,das good
7068,This game is Fun and not easy to grind but the Lack of tanks and Maps Makes it kindda boring
7069,"After 6 hours of gameplay on steam and 20+ hours on android, I can safely say that you can try WoT Blitz if you like tank simulation games. In particular its not realistic, but the combat system is fun and very tactical. Movement is really weird and it should be made a little smoother but rest everything is fine. The matchmaking is balanced on both the teams with equal firepower. Graphics are great too! And if you have a potato PC, worry not because it works on that too. Enjoy blasting!!!"

7109,I hate this game <3
7110,"The gameplay is pretty good, most tanks are balanced and have their disadvantages and advantages, my biggest problem is how slow the turrets turn. It makes responding to an attack difficult. Some of the game consists of pay to win, I dislike how premium users have greater advantages, like being able to purchase more powerful tanks, having more tank slots, etc. If you want a free to play game that doesn't cheat you, I wouldn't recommend you play this. It's best that you have a few $ ready, just in case."
7111,Good Game
7112,"Use to be a great game, use to love the Graphics, they were stunning and realistic, with a rewarding system. Now its just pay to win and the graphics have had such a downgrade to the point where the graphics at max are pretty much the same as my phones which is why they changed i guess for cross platform, The whole reason i made an account and started playing in the first place was because it offered a realistic looking Tank combat game now it feels to Arcade like and not at all like a serious game. Im so glad i dont have access to my OG account anymore I would hate to see it on these Beyond awful graphics and pay to win systems"

You can also know more tanks and fill up your knowledge about tanks thats been used during 1930 to 1990, you can also drive cool tanks and feel good about your self. The communication system in the game is also perfect, you can talk to strangers and plan with them.

7160,"An easy-to-play and competitive game that, despite being partially pay-to-win, also requires quick use of tactics and strategies; IOW: just because your opponent has a premium limited-ed heavy tank, does not mean you can't bring them down a notch with a few swift moves. 

A huge variety of tanks to choose from, especially for the Nazi Germany, USA and USSR factions. The development team has been really great so far with their content, so expect fantastic content to be added regularly. There are also tournaments that occur regularly for those that enjoy gaming online competitively.

The areas the require some focus are perhaps adding more aesthetics to the tanks and more daily tasks to unlock bonuses and items"

7178,better than War Thunder. And I've only played 6 hours.
7179,"I did buy the mega pack DLC only because it was on a quite a cheap discount, 95% is a very good deal in my eyes. But even then, I still want a refund.
The game itself is quite unbalanced I find, or at least matchmaking is. I was destroying a lobby with my tier I tank and the next lobby got boosted to tier X, I'm exaggerating a bit but it felt like that. I was unable to penetrate anyone and died a few seconds after being spotted. From some of the reviews, I've read before this, they conclude, as I've said, that the game is unbalanced. Read some other reviews for more detailed reasoning as I don't want to copy cat on what has already been said. I will recommend this game only if you have a poor system, War Thunder is just better though WOT can be easier to learn the ins and outs of its design and work. I'm saying this because War Thunder can be a bit overwhelming compared to this game, though that is only backed up on the few hours of game time I have on War Thunder and PhlyDaily.

Pay to Win > Play to Win, I will keep playing but only because of the DLC and the artillery tanks that got me interested in playing again.
Again being the mobile version of this game a few years back on an all-nighter, I did not regret it until I fell asleep in a shop and regretted my bad judgement of when to sleep."
7180,guys help how do i restart I played when I was like 9-10 and now I have stuff and I cant remember how to play help
7181,"the game has serious issues with pay to win mechanics and overpowered premium tanks.
the matchmaking balance is a joke, if any sort of balance even exists.
the free to play experience is mostly pain.
the game gives little to no instruction for new players how to properly play the game, so you end up with a bunch of utterly useless players 90% of the time.

why do I still play? I guess it's just an addiction at this point"
7182,"You'll see the same opinions on many other reviews but the simple truth is Wargaming do not make fun games and aren't a friendly developer (trust pilot score of 1.3 on 763 reviews). Basically if you want to give you time, happiness and potentially money to some shady Russian c's so you can be frustrated and miserable then this is the game for you!"

7209,"Good game, better than world of tanks for beginners to tank games."
7210,"Absolutely, it has so many realistic tanks from ww2 always been a sucker for WW2 tank games. One thing to keep in mind is that the game is designed to be pay to win, so dont expect to get far very fast because its pay to win. They need the money so their gonna do what they can to do so. Of course they have ruined tier VII so dont play near there if you can to get used to the game. UPDATE: 9.1 has really changed my view on the game, i don't like that they really buffed autoloaders. so much so that they can full clip a HEAVY tank. thats just ridiculous."
7211,"Wargaming did a great job with this game, and they also have excellent tech support! Make sure you play until after tier 5, and that's when the game comes alive. If you get a chance to get a gold tank, do it. It will help you grind money to buy other tech tree tanks. Gold tanks make way more money each match than tech tree tanks. Tier 6,7,8 are where the action is, and tier ten is more like Chess. Don't be in a rush to get to tier 10 either. Once you get a tier 10 tank daily missions become harder to finish (so you don't get extra crates with goodies as easy). And if you rush you won't learn the fundamentals of the game. Learn your tank and learn the others as well. It will help you win. It's a team based game. But one man can make a difference under the right circumstances. And remember to have fun and don't yolo.   -  BlackTopDemon NA"
7212,nice
7213,Better than WoT due to faster games and faster grinding. Got my first tier 10 somewhat easy compared to vanilla WoT

7233,"I grew up playing this game and in my opinion, Blitz is way better than the Regular."
7234,"Unfortunatelly this game represents new way of gaming. Instead of providing you with proper content that keeps you entertained for hours they try to captivate you inside of casino like events and lootboxes, create habits in you via many in-game actions that provide you with various bonuses but only in case you are active daily and/or pay some money. Game tries to force habits on players so that they return daily. This is reinforced by introducing various tanks (like Annihilator) that are simply much better than the other vehicles (speaking from position of Annihilator owner).

On top of this Wargaming is simply unable (or does not want) to introduce a proper matchmaking. You end up either in team that owns opponent or you are in the team that gets completely owned, there is no middle-ground for the most part. I would really like to see games where players act tactically and help each other but for some reason that does not happen here or very rarely. This pattern repeats on several Wargaming games.

The game is good overall but matchmaking ruins all the fun + you can feel how badly company wants your money on every corner. WoT Blitz cunningly and silently wants to become your drug, but then fails to entertain you after a while."
7235,.
7236,Well the game is amazing but when you drive and see the green guide to where you are going makes me mad and the people that said the game is Pay 2 win it is welcome to 2020 you got the game free but you pay for the products you can buy other games on steam the you also pay this is life get use to it you guys like updated games but how do they need to update a game if they can't pay people to do it. So yes pay 2 play and I love it if you don't like it play another game
7237,"Fun to play as an in-between-times game, because it has matches which last only a few minutes at max (time limit) and matches are found nearly instantly - even during the nighttimes!...

Reaching T6 has shown that it indeed becomes pay2farm. You nearly constantly need to be on the winning team and be a high scorer or you won't be able to farm credits, which you need for new tanks... And the prices are high. You may often lose credits, depending on your match performance."
7238,fucking pay to winnnn!!!!!!!!!! I fucking hate this fucking gameee
7239,good game to play
7240,It's a good time killer or thing to do while listening to a  lecture on remote learning ;)
7241,"This game used to be fun until it wasnt... Developers care only and only about the money they make so no balancing or any realy work is done in the game. Tier 7 is basically ruined if you want to work on your tech tree tanks, its filled with OP pay to win vehicles and the worst part is developers are fully aware of this and they dont give a single **** about it, on the contrary, they release more broken tanks in the tier and make lots of money off of it! Also the matchmaking is close to non-existent one day i play 28 matches make 80% winrate, the next day out of 14 matches i have 20% winrate. Nobody can explain how my performance dropped this much overnight, its solely the fault of bad matchmaking. Wouldn't recommend to anyone until something is done."
7242,"quite fun, even tho this game have premium ammo and premium tank, you can still catch up using the regular one. BUT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS... this game is ruined by its toxic community. I honestly turn off global chat. It just a casual game but people act like they will lost their soul if they lose. I know your win rate will drop if you lose but come on.. It easy to overcome Annihilator or Smasher but the toxic chat uhhh"
7243,"Play to win game. It was good before with fair matchmaking system and progress required to get a good tank. Now it is all about spending money and getting premium to avoid being in shitty parties. 
Waste of time!!!"

7246,"Very Realistic, Has Tech Tree and Many Different Tanks Plus Cool Maps!!"
7247,"I really enjoy the game. 

I don't believe the match making program is correct. Matching should be based on battles won percentage. If players have a 60+% ...should all be playing together. Putting 60%'ers with 40%'s is unfair and ridiculed for not being a 60% player. 

Chat is not regulated and there should be moderators available for in game communication."

7253,"Hello,
The big problem reamains unfortunatlely,the lack of fair-play of MM.Nobody likes to leave, most of the time, with a second chance even in a game like WOT Blitz.
The feeling you have , as a player,and I assure you that I have talked with a lot of players, is that you are, somehow, cheated.
Even in peack hours,the proportion in wich I play against those in the uppper tiers reaches, in my case, about 70%!
It is not normal!! 
And in these conditions, do you expect us to buy Blitz products?? Noo!!"
7254,Just Another Pay To Win Game.
7255,"it's fun
7/10"
7256,"so good
"
7257,its fun if you know what you're doing and have a decent tank that isnt stock or you need to grind through ( the fact that it feels like you need to grind a tank and some feel like hurdles is an issue all in itself) however it is filled with some bs like things. Good luck if you are starting in 2020 but it is free and the company deserves to make money with the broken tanks. If you dont know what im talking about go play tier 8
7258,"GREAT, FUN, REALISTIC, GAME 5/5"
7259,"for as many years that i've been playing this, the result is usually the same. all too often i'll end up flustered at the playerbase, because the large majority of the players are sub 45-50%'ers and that in turn, screws over most of the battles i play. too many end in 6/7 to zero (win or lose) because these people refuse to learn the game after playing more than 10k battles. kinda inexcusable after that point, if you ask me. i'm not even talking about the p2w debate in this game, because it's irrelevant to the point.

as of today i'm a 58%'er with a 2.4k career wn8, and it's bullsht that i continually have to deal with the toxicity that honestly has little repercussion, or far and few in between. not only that when i also have to hard-carry a fair majority of the games that i end up in, all the while a player that has no clue what they're talking about spams the chat with basic insults at me, while i basically win the match FOR them. 
at this point, i'm just stat buffing these people that refuse to learn, while they drag me down. i'm not asking for ppl to get sweaty over this game, but jfc, at what point do you learn while not so readily throwing insults and blame others for your ineptitude."
7260,"alot of options to choose from. I didnt get far in the game because it gave me an headache, probably because my PC couldn't handle this game at high FPS. Not totally sure why."
7261,haha tank go boom
7262,It's good for a few hours but then you download war thunder and see how shit this is.
7263,A great game and even for free :)
7264,"Very fun, but you have to be pretty dedicated to level up your tanks and research higher tiers. It is somewhat pay to win, some tanks are only available through microtransaction. I also wish it was a tad bit easier to accrue gold coins and that you could play online matches with more than two people and not have to be confined to the training room to play with friends."
7265,it kicks ass!
7266,"Played this game years ago and decided to give it another try - forced to play a long, boring unskippable tutorial that was just things i already knew. This is not a good experience for a returning player."
7267,wwe
7268,The UI is ugly af.
7269,"Однообразный геймплей: гринд-гринд-гринд. Если уровень мастерства позволяет — можно играть бесплатно. Если нет, придётся раскошелиться, поскольку без премиального аккаунта прокачка будет мучительно долгой. В общем эта игра типичный денежный пылесос. Плюс агрессивные подростки составляют подавляющее большинство, их бесконечные вопли, нецензурщина и угрозы добавляют игровому процессу особый шарм.
Ну и в отличие от ""старшего брата"" даже версия для ПК выглядит довольно убого и архаично, ведь разработчикам важно, чтобы их детище работало даже на кнопочных телефонах."

7271,nice for free. grindy
7272,wow
7273,"Too buggy. Every major update makes the game unplayable for weeks. Support does nothing. Tickets are closed with an apology and thats it.
UPDATED REVIEW: Updates seem to be far less buggy than before. No post-update the game is still playable."
7274,better off with warthunder
7275,"nice game, easy..quick and fun,  very little cheating that I can see (no expert though)"
7276,"from a war thunder player ( about 4k hours) .
this game is  less stressful than war thunder , it seems like most of the gifts  with premium account and subscription , but when you exit the game you don't feel depressed .
compared to war thunder, yeh it is simple but fun , not that much of math and penetration calculation  but it's fun, looks like servers are more stable  than war thunder . 

premium comparing : 
in world of tanks : with premium you can make credits easy  you don't loose that much .
in war thunder : with premium account you still sometimes get  -20k  repair cost  for 1 tank  or higher for top tier ."
7277,Great
7278,"Just play War Thunder, there's so much more to do."
7279,Cool.
7280,Yeah its pretty cool i guess
7281,good
7282,"graphics and general play. sometimes a tank will go out of control - in certain conditions, this can lead to fatal results that a player would not suffer if the tank remained under control."
7283,WOot! fun game. I dont have the reaction times for Counter strike anymore. But this game is competitive and a blast i can handle :)
7284,It´s Good
7285,"""spend money on all our stuff so you can kill some bots"""
7286,Its gone to far into p2w territory
7287,i have played this game seance the british tanks where added so i have experiance and i think this game is great it needs some in provement but all games need it and it ese i have low time in this game because i got it on a nother divice
7288,No arty
7289,"Let's be honest, I only wrote this review to gain awards."
7290,There are many reasons why this game is bad. Go play it and spend hundreds of dollars on it to find out.
7291,very nice game
7292,"Just tank
"
7293,like this
7294,Very epic and cool game
7295,i mean its 7v7 peeps with big tonks with a very interesting community. why wouldnt u play?
7296,"no instructions or goals or how to anything. thanks for nothing as that is what game is, game is free & it does nothing. It sat for 3 hours as I had no way to turn it off. JUNK WASTE MY TIME."
7297,nice game
7298,"The amount of player cheating/hacking in this game makes it completely not worth even downloading the POS. It's gotten so bad that when literally right up against an opposing tank and firing point blank with nothing but tank in front of you, you do zero damage, and your opponent will blow you up a second later with only a single shot. Don't even bother wasting your time with this POS.
"
7299,"ive spent too much, just too much"
7300,This is most valuable to spent your boring life
7301,"Not blyad, pretty much of the same stuff happening, like leveling up and thats the whole game"
7302,this is super game i have base game the big one and let me tell you like that wot blitz is alot batter then wot it is more fun maches are shorter and games are not so campy i like it beacuse of fast game play even with churrchiles and black prince you can get decent amount of damage done
7303,Better than the real world of tanks because it's smaller maps with no arty and less powers creeps for faster games so better game and really fun!
7304,"quite fun to play, only if more than 1 friend can join to play"
7305,This is the best game in the world!
7306,Awesome
7307,pay to win shit game... not ever equal tire matchmaking.

7310,Fun and easy to play and understand.
7311,"Great game. It is frustrating when you play with no money, and your light tank encounters Heavy Tank... Great Aiming and movement system."
7312,matilda best tank
7313,nice job
7314,coolest game everrr
7315,is good
7316,"Let's be honest, I only wrote this review to gain awards."
7317,"Nice game!
"
7318,"Good fun, easy to learn but need money to master."
7319,This game is a great alternative to the regular World of Tanks if your computer can't handle the graphics
7320,"I love this game. The only downside is RNG (Random number generator) aka the game decides where your shots go, how much damage they do, and the penetration they have, among other things"
7321,"My previous review was dumb and stupid.
WoTB has many flaws, yes, and it can be a horrendous game on many occasions, but by god can it also be fun. It's free, it's easy to run, it takes up a tiny amount of space, and it's a blast with friends. You're a fool if you don't at least try it."
7322,"Öncelikle merhaba arkadaşlar 
Bu World of Tanks oyunu gayet güzel bir oyun fakat oyuna başlarken direk dümdüz başlamayın ya oyun hakkında bilgisi olan bir arkadaş eşliğinde başlayın yada youtube üzerinden videolar izleyerek başlayın eğer dümdüz başlarsanız oyundan çok çabuk sıkılırsınız ve oyunun hiçbir anlamı kalmaz . Zaten tanklara ilginiz varsa direk başlayın kaçırmayın bu oyunu derim :)"
7323,"Please start Roblox and play Armored Patrol instead, at least you can activate suspension.
Or just you know download the real World of Tanks game from their website."
7324,I LOVE THE NEW TANKS
7325,Good game
7326,"It's hard to ignore the pay to win aspect of the game's microtransactions, and the grindiness of the game if you're trying to play for free. It makes it hard to dedicate the time you need to it if money tilts things to other players' advantage."
7327,"pay to win bs why is this game even still alive 
all new battlepasses that are near impossible to complete without giving wargaming half of you bank account I swear to god the only reason people still play this is because nobody's come up with anything close to it
overall, if you haven't started playing already, don't"

it is a really cool game."
7336,"
there are so many hackers and matchmaking sucks and there is no report option + they wont let you leave unless you die in game. >:("
7337,Very fun
7338,"What drew me into this game was a friend telling my to pair up with him, so I clicked on the download button and clicked away.

What I found was a game that is so heavily reliant on you spending money that It puts off new players, I did enjoy the gameplay at times but when The whole game becomes P2W it detests New players and makes their player base fall. 
When I asked my friend why  he still plays this game it's that the investment of time and energy that he put on this game makes it hard to let go of."
7339,"fuck this game
fuck their matchmaking
fuck my teammates
dont waste ur time playing this fucking game 
"
7340,"The matchmaking still shit, welp, i finally done with this game."
7341,ue 57
7342,Pretty fun game if you ask me. It's all the fun of WoT PC but for mobile or low performance pc's/laptops.
7343,It is a very action packed game with lots of features all in one! And the best its free!!! I thought this game would be like anything else but they made this look amazing and put in a lot of effort.
7344,"almost everything is luck and you wont hit any of your shots. this game broke me

7347,"blowin shit up is awesome
"
7348,"If you are looking for an arcade style tank shooter this is for you. It is especially great if you are an older player that no longer has the reflexes of a teenager. This game requires you to use strategy, positioning, teamwork, and knowledge of enemy tanks to be a great player."

7354,great game but like the ships. can be costly $$$$
7355,A very good tank game with very colorful graphics!
7356,"WoT isn't the most realistic tank combat game, but it is good. It's newbie friendly and is quite fun. You can upgrade your tank to crazy levels, and it's just a blast, although, if you want a more realistic and less ""Toony"" looking game, Try War Thunder."
7357,"Honestly, this is no difference as wot pc. buy premium tanks/ reward tanks which you will have to pay and gg that the game. and has too many balance issues"
7358,tHIS GAME TEAM BALANCING IS POOR. U WILL GET IN A TEAM WITH HIGHER TEAR ENEMIES WICH IS UNFAIR AND IT RUINS FUN.
7359,"Fun. Action from start to finish. Need to Clan Up, I think."

7361,NICE
7362,"just a fun game overall, plus it's free! yes, there might be in-app purchases and stuff, but none of that is necessary!"
7363,"It is a good game, I like it, but its just to P2W early on, you can still do good with the basic tech trees, but paying money makes it 10x easier to win. Overall, good game, but to p2w."
7364,fun to play with friends but very pay to win
7365,"Recent update and new gold sci-fi tank saw the downfall of this game. ** annihilator can one shot you head to head, dracula can drive 70km/s like a hack"

7367,nu krasavcik igra
7368,"Tanks, classics of the genre, can they compete with the older version? Well, given that a fairly large number of people still have rather old PCs, and that the younger version is less demanding, we can say that yes, it has found its own, and not a small audience, since I also play people from phones in it, but also there is no art, because of which, again, many left the older version. Often there are various interesting events, with the opportunity to play and sometimes win an unusual technique, well, the battles here are much more dynamic, due to the small size of the maps. The only direct such a global minus is that when playing on the phone you can get to people playing the keyboard, which is not very honest (fortunately, there is a button in the settings to enable the same control and you must not forget to enable it))"
7369,"This is a more casual, and  less complex version of WOT. It is more relaxed and pleasant to play. The players seem more agreeable, and work together more closely to achieve a win. It is much easier to establish the unspoken or even suggested cooperation for a plan of attack. A lesson perhaps the regular WOT should pay attention to and emulate. For casual play, It is a better version of WOT,  in my opinion."
7370,Not really what you expect
7371,"Its very realistic, and fun to play. Some pay to win aspects, as well as its kinda grindy. Tier 1-5 are just bad, but past that the game is a blast. I recommend others play it!"
7372,love it
7373,"game has an autistic player base, yet i still come back to this cumshot of a game"
7374,"Its a pay to win so dont be mad :)
but i mean its still a good game 
not as good as before but still worthy to be downloaded


STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME
It's a curse you play you waste time/money

ITS NOT WORTH IT!
"
7375,so far quiet addicted
7376,top !
7377,"This is a fairly fun game, you get to go around and destroy other tanks, upgrade your own, and figure out your own style of tanks. The only thing I find myself disliking is having to wait to make a clan until you get a Tier V tank, which unless you grind hard on this game, takes a bit to get, both research and coin wise. Other than that, this game is fairly addicting, and I look forward to future updates."
7378,"This is a wonderful game,i think it's really fun!!!!! It's easy to play the game
"
7379,"Good game and super FUN!!!!!!!!  I think it is extremely well put together, if you're looking for a great shooter multiplayer THIS is what you're looking for! SO MANY TANKS!! it's not too slow going pretty fast at the start. (go to the united states of America and get m2 light don’t upgrade it, good starter tank) so the download is also petty fast so DOWNLOAD IT TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
7380,Gets a bit grindy on the higher tiers but is overall fun and balanced for mobile users. You must understand that this is not an accurate simulation of tank battles since it is optrimized for phones though.
7381,"The game is rigged really bad with mostly tards playing now. my revision is that this game is rigged so bad to get veterans to quit.  I have never seen so many reetards in my life.  We will be at war with Russia and Belarus anyways, so it is un-American to play Wargaming games now."
7382,Great game very fun and action packed
7383,"It's really fun and a good waste of time
A good one."
7384,Great Games lots of fun
7385,"258 hrs in on pc, and two plus years mobile gaming on WoT. Better than the console version, easy to hop on and off of, and chill but competitive. Stylish, savvy, and fun as heck."
7386,"топ
"
7387,"Great game, toxic community."
7388,"Personally I have played this game for years and I might not be the best but I'll tell you one thing it's got a good community a lot of friendly clans who welcome even the worst of players it can get a bit toxic but what game doesn't, anyways I would download it if you are into tank mmo games because this one is amazing. 10/10"
7389,"Great shit, i played the original WOT since i was young, and then some years later i began to play this game. And i like it very much! :) :bobblebear:"
7390,yes good

7392,good

7394,fun game
7395,lots of fun. accurate movement and firre controls.
7396,"this game is awful... the graphics are terrible doesn't even look like a historical background.
they add special game modes here and there for a very short time. the player base is so bad like most match ups you'll get your likely to lose anyway because player are so bad now a days.
and because of the terrible players it messes up the matchmaker so much. it is very  pay to win, a new tank comes out that costs way to much gold and normally just has better stats than a lot of tanks in the game on its tier level. don't waste your time on this game. wargaming the people who made this game ignore the youtubers who try and suggest ideas to wargaming to make there game better. but nope they wont listen. in conclusion don't get this game."

7398,Very good not a pay to win and no adds on mobile either

7400,This review matters. This will be the game of March 2021 I can assure you.
7401,One of the undying games. There aren't many players but still surviving. Overall an enjoyable game.
7402,45er
7403,this game is a fun educational game and helps you learn more about how tanks are.
7404,good game
7405,"This game is alright as of now but there are a fair amount problems. Its mostly the crates (sometimes its scam), a matchmaker that can sometimes be completely broken, toxicity and awful trends within some parts of the community."
7406,when u hug the wall and gets stuck on the weirdest places.
7407,COULD DO WITH MORE MAPS
7408,"If you want to play with World of Tanks (the real WoT, this is just a simplified version of that) that is the best solution. You can get the same feeling playing with this game insted of WoT. If you don't have the space, or the system requirements to WOT you can basicly download this and play with this game. This game even has a cross platforming availability, taht means you can play this on your phone --> save it than play with your saved game on your pc, laptop, mac etc.
And this game gets regularly an update with tanks, maps, balances, graphics and more.

In a nutshell this is a really good game"
7409,"Its fun and its very unique! Its simple, and great for new gamers looking for something free and fun!
"
7410,Очередной говно-высер от Воров и Геев!
7411,Fun game to play!
7412,"Игроков можно разделить на две категории - те, кто играет пальцами и те, кто членом возит по клаве или сенсору. Проще дождаться пенсии, чем помощи от союзников. Баланс подбора игроков почти отсутствует. Комьюнити адекватностью не отличается. А *уле я играю тогда? Ну не в нормальную же картошку идти."
7413,"great game for people who loves tanks, though tank stats change cuz devs are weird"
7414,Fun
7415,Garbage gambling game.
7416,Evertything!
7417,Logged back in one day and all my tanks were gone including the premium tanks that I had paid money for. this is such a rotten business practice and I wouldn't recommend giving them a cent
7418,"It is great for those who like a smaller environment with fewer opponents, and you can play it on your phone vs pc"
7419,Good for laggy player???ssss
7420,This gameplay stiff like a brick. Pen and bounce seems without reason. Overall got much worse compare to 5 years ago.
7421,"Yey
"
7422,boring
7423,"This game is publicly pay to win. Did not play that much to point out broken balance between free to play and pay to win tanks, which other veteran players mentioned. I can give a simple example: If your tanks ammunition does not penetrate through enemy tanks, don't worry just buy gold currency to get a load of high penetrate capacity torpedos for your tanks and fire some  golden skin ammunition to enemies."
7424,"This is a fun game! Most of the time. It is very Pay2Win, and you will be constantly bombarded with offers and other such things. If you are Play2Win, you will spend many hours grinding for exp and credits. Just be warned before playing. However, it looks amazing and I don't mind the grind as much as I normally would because of that and the play. 3.7 out of 5 stars"
7425,Cool tank game

Horrible servers

7446,"It is a good version and really the ""cheap version"" of the normal World Of Tanks. This is a good intro, But try to get the normal please....."
7447,Awesome god dam game
7448,Trash P2W game. Probably paid for their positive reviews with kid's mom's credit cards.
7449,"The game is really cool and it is easy to get into. Sure, you may need a little skill, but driving around and shooting stuff is epic! the tank models are insanely accurate, especially when you note how shooting a tank at different angles may cause your shots to richochet off instead of dealing damage, making for an insanely realistic battle. 
"
7450,good
7451,Best game ever!
7452,"Review again on 3rd May 2022, after 2 years of service

- A totally trash game, where developer focus on getting $ from new players and ignore others. You can easily find newbie with less than 100 battles using premium tank at tier X, just to show off when having no idea what to do

- Broken match maker mechanic for many months long, and not a single thing about planning to fix, only more events to get more $. Enjoy the show when 1 side got LT and MT to spot, other side got none

- Developer like to sell tanks in gamble boxes, where they claim the rate is 5%. You can consider yourself having good luck when get the tank on first try, while others spend over 200 USD and still cannot get the none

- All reports will be ignore, no action taken aside from a reply that they would take action, and after few days you can find the same player doing the same thing again

- Even when you are 0 star, you will not be punished at all. So enjoy ruining other players games at will

Before May 2021, I would recommend, but now its not worthy. I dont want to spend any single $ more for WG, and already stopped doing so since Dec 2021"
7453,"This game is for retarded peoples, i wish that i never tried it and never spended 0.01$ in it."
7454,Noice
7455,"very nice game i would very much like larger maps and maybe a 3v3 gamemode and death match

7456,Would rather play WarThunder. Cpntrols too janky.

7461,Yes
7462,"couple of days of shits n giggles, other than that, garbage.....if u can handle 38 losses compared to 7 wins, dont know bout u, but i have a life, LOL"
7463,"Tanks are my favorite vehicle, this was a natural pick for me. Great game."
7464,literally pay to win
7465,i love the game
7466,"Really fun, lots of tanks
BUT
The popup adds are worse than mobile games, even after buying premium the game keeps locking you out of content unless you pay more

I got to rank 5 and suddenly started getting 7 streak losses after a 60ish % win rate, getting the sinking feeling that the game is matching me then promoting the premium tanks so i can buy my way to winning soon as i thought that i dropped the game"
7467,great game
7468,Disgusting. Just play anything else
7469,"boring

7478,Very noice
7479,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT!!!!!!!!!
7480,"it is fun. They player base is not toxic, and most are nice. I'm coming from mobile but its fine. I really like it."
7481,Like the game
7482,"I don't like how I have to buy 20 shells before every battle even though I had 15 left over from the previous battle, not really free to play if you keep charging me for ammunition for every match, this the type of practice that is going to make uninstall this game so you can no longer fleece me for a ""Free To Play"" game."
7483,7/10 i'ts fun but I like the Full PC version more.

7500,"Great game

7501,good game for easy arcade and low performance deivices.

7503,Tanks go bang and brrrr
7504,noice
7505,good
7506,This game is one of my favourites. It's very good.
7507,now that i have played this game for this long it has its problems like ghost shells and its a gamble if you buy containers which makes you spend more if you want the tank the game is full of p2w but its still pretty f2p friendly only complain is the rng but its fun overall
7508,awesome game

7510,"steam keeps asking me to revise my review.
here it is.
steam asked me to revise my review, again.
i'm still saying to go play war thunder.
steam didn't ask me to revise my review this time, now i'm just adding that i've started getting unplayable levels of packet loss for no reason the last few days. even more reasons not to play this game"
7511,its an app version. get the real FREE game via there website
7512,rgfdgdfdfgdfg
7513,totaly worth the download i have expirience with mmo games and recomend u play this
7514,good
7515,If you do not pay you will have to grind a lot
7516,"This game is pretty bad because all you do is drive until you see someone and you literally just take turn shooting eachother and the person with the better tank wins, that is literally the whole game with no skill or any other mechanism involved."
7517,At the beginning you have no chance at all because you will only be matched with small children who have spent over 100 dollars from their parents for this game !!!
7518,Not as complicated as the regular World Of Tanks but a great game for quick games.
7519,"fun to play
"
7520,Only thing that isn't cool about this game is you can only play with one friend at a time.
7521,"epico
"
7522,"great on the go game, wanna play the same account on your phone? play this game"
7523,"Pretty solid game I'd say, although so many things have changed it almost feels strange to me, like I'm a new player again. Would still recommend tho, just watch for the top players/clans and focus on ONE tech tree to make things easier on you as you make your way through each tier."

7525,"I invested hundreds of hours into World of Tanks on PC a long time ago. Decided to give this a go and was not disappointed. The main reason I stopped playing the main game is because of the time investment it takes. This is a quicker version, faster battles, but still good ol' tanking fun. A nice casual game, lots of optional pay-for items, but lots of opportunity to earn free gold and items too. A good balance! Enjoying it so far."
7526,fun game
7527,not that much satisfied.   snapchat - vivek_gz
7528,"I really like how realistic the tanks are. Compared to some other games, the gameplay is very equal. I really enjoy playing higher teer games. Overall highly recommend playing this game or the same game but not blitz, that one is a bit tougher."
7529,It's fun with friends
7530,Вау говно вкусное.
7531,"As fun as the game *can* be its not gonna be fun until around tier VIII or VII. The game is super grindy, ive spent a year grinding the game only to come to 1 tier X and just barley coming up on the M46 Patton. Theres also too many OP tanks i.e Gravedigger due to armor and gun at Tier VI or VII, the Smasher due to insane accuracy, damage, and reload at tier VII, ISU and SU-152 due to its insane stock gun at tier VIII and VII."
7532,"игра прнкрасно, но иногда бамбит, советую она не плоха ведь многие любят танки"
7533,good game
7534,"El mejor juego que e probado encerio , super dinamico las partidas super rapidas y lo mejor es que podes jugar con amigos"
7535,HITLER MADE THOSE TANKS.THEY MAKE MONEY OUT OF IT!!!
7536,It's become a lot more fun the last time I played it in 2018. If you're looking to just shoot and drive tanks then this game should give you some good fun
7537,Tier X game is good. The in app purchase seem a bit imbalanced. To really get a tier 10 tank is very expensive and playing in all the others is useless if you value only multiplayer. The time spent going through lower tier tanks is not fun for me. But I love the only tier x tank I have been able to unlock and play rating battles in it.
7538,"whatever about the p2w stuff, still nothing can hit T62A's stalinium turret.
anyway, a good point is that I can camp with it in peace, without any arty hitting me of nowhere.
but on another hand, I still see random missiles coming of nowhere while I try to evade from them.

7542,Pay to win makes the gameplay really unpleasant.
7543,"I've played this game for over 6 years now, and I'm finally going to write my FINAL review of this game.
This game... used to be very fun. (It still is at times). But now... it's not that fun anymore.
WG really only cares about the money at this point, this game used to be very fun but now it's just another P2W game.
The matchmaker of this game is so trash at this point, that your only way of winning is using OP tanks or even going further by using OP tanks in a platoon. (Like Smasher platoon, T22 platoon, Obj. 252U etc.)
And to get those OP tanks, you ofc need to spend a sh*t load of money to get those tanks.
This game used to be fun, it really was, but now because all this P2W sh*t it really isn't that much fun anymore.
You can already tell from how many players are starting to quit the game (or the amount of players who have already quit the game in the last year or so).
So at THIS point of the game, no, I would not really recommend this game (unless you're willing to spend a lot of money that is), I myself am a F2P player and I don't really win that much anymore just because of the trash matchmaker.
WG really need to fix their matchmaker and care about their customers, I mean it."
7544,really cool game.
7545,best
7546,only play if u are good at grinding
7547,"Its a pay to win. Don't even bother getting it. The only people who win are the people who purchase the ton of premium tanks that cost over 10 US dollars. There are more premium tanks and upgrades than there are normal tanks. Every time you load the game you have advertisements for these 'premium' tanks shoved into your face. 
I'm being serious, don't get it."
7548,"WoT is a great game involving tanks.  The developers don't take it too seriously, which makes a fun game.  I would recommend it to everyone.  You need deep pockets to buy some tanks."
7549,It is a good game when lag doesn't trip you up.
7550,"This game is a scam, pay to win to many hours spent spent on this trash game and believe me please don´t fall for this trash game."

7556,"How to improve and balance the game? Hmm, maybe remove bullshit premium rounds as a starter... you name the rest."
7557,"Good gameplay..No arty at its best...but bunch of AFK'ers and rushtiered who know nothing about basic.
Problem is while connection just been bad for second you need to restart whole game..its just annoying especially when on decisive battle. unlike pc version who got better lost-connection-tolerant so no need to restart whole game just for reconnect.
imagine if you come back from restarting game you and your team already dead."
7558,THE GAME IS SO FUN I LOVE PLAYING IT!!!
7559,yess
7560,"I would say you'd need to optimize higher graphics settings for more low-end computers and mobile devices. 

Sure this game isn't the most graphic intensive game. But not ALL devices can run this game at good graphics. which sucks.  



other than that. good game."
7561,this game is just awesome!!! amazing graphics while it was made in 2016!!! the gameplay awesome too.. and it doesnt have hackers.. it just requires skill... gl its just a little bit pay to win thats all

7566,I played the regular world of tanks and the fact that is NO ARTY and the battles are restricted to 7v7 is great.Tho the controls are a little outdated but still decent
7567,The lag in the game is so bad now that it is almost unplayable. I would not recommend it to anyone. They really need to fix it.

7606,"One of my top 3 mobile games that I play regularly on my phone. The graphics are pretty good, and the details of historical vehicles are pretty realistic. They have a ton of tanks, although they should expand the lineup to include more Czech and Polish tanks in my opinion. 

As far as gameplay, it can be a tossup. Playing aggressive will get you killed fast, so learning to be a more tactically minded player, one who works with your teammates, will get you ahead in the game. I tend to play aggressive, so I tend to die fast lol. Joining an active clan can help you learn quickly how to play. I will add more as it comes to me, the game does have its downsides, and does every game, but overall I give it a respectable 8/10."

7619,unfair team matching
7620,"[h1] The Start [/h1]
The game teaches you about how to control your tank, fire your gun, and how the UI in the game works. I really hope they would teach more, but still this is only the basics.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
A pretty chill game at first, since you are fighting against bots. But after a while, It will be very challenging. Because the game introduces you to full-team real players after you reached tier 5, It's pretty hard to do good against ""Seal clubbers"" aka experienced players playing lower tier tanks just to get better statistics in their profile. But if you have successfully cross the barrier, surely you'll enjoy this game since it has a LOT of tanks.

[h1] Pay-To-Win Things [/h1]
Even if this game is free to download, sure enough it drags you into paying for something good (Which I have never spent any bucks into this games for well over 4 years since I started playing this game in my phone). There are some Over-Powered tanks to achieve only by paying and some events in the game are impossible to grind unless you don't have a life.

[h1] Overall [/h1]
World of Tanks Blitz is a nice game if you've taken enough time into it, It is enjoying to fight people with vastly different tanks available to be acquired in this game. And since I've been playing it for so long I surely will recommend this game to anyone that likes tanks or just likes how this game plays out over time.

7621,"The game runs well even on my crappy Dell. The game is good and comes with lots of cheap offers that are worth your wallet. The game offers lots of tanks/lines to grind for as a mobile/steam game. However, servers can be unstable sometimes. May lead to sudden ping spikes and disconnects. Everything except the lag is good. And the matchmaking lmao"

7623,Dobra! Great!
7624,"IT IS A CHALLAGE FOR THE TANKS

Especially the Silver/Gold Exchange.
The battles themselves are a lot of fun.
I wouldn't worry about realism. In fact I don't."

7632,Good fun most of the time. Enjoying the game except when teamed up with total noobs 5 games in a row.  Stick with it!
7633,ok
7634,Nice game overall but pretty messed up nowadays
7635,"The less try hard version of World of Tanks. Much more casual and fun. However, much more power creep for certain tank classes and premium vehicles. OP premium vehicles pretty prevalent in the Blitz game. No artillery, light tanks are pretty useless."

7640,"algunos conceptos y caracteristicas del juego me gustan, como los distintos tipos y nacionalidades de tanques, que la da mas variedad, hay otras que no, como el hecho que sea un poco pay to win, pero creo que es un juego simplon para pasar un rato.

pd: no probre jugarlo con amigos (antisocial) pero creo que seria divertido"

7647,"FUCK YEAH, best game ever"
7648,"great game, but money hungry company."
7649,yes
7650,"So I played this game since it s started, I m 70% wr player with 2K+ average dmg, and I can asure you that even if u don t spend money u can still win,if u want to to have it easy start with the french heavys and keelp the arl44, start with crew 75% and use free xp only on modules, and buy premium amo u can buy premium amo credits u don t need to pay gold if u can change to credits.This game also has tournaments in which everyone can play, and there are also from tournaments from which you can earn money if you have a good team. The game has a lot of events and now it got a battlepass which is helpfull for new players and also for mid-late game players."
7651,"Pay to win indeed but you cant pay for skill, its a nice game that feels good to play, just know there are always bigger tanks with bigger wallets and some players are playing on a telephone on a train with no sleep. The game can make you lose however you play the RNG seems to be the way this happens, even if you are good and fight hard, hits can do nothing and other team smack every shot, then you get on the team that is hitting every shot max RNG , lol"
7652,The game is passable enough for killing time. The constant repetition of the maps is intended for you to master strategic places.
7653,Very pro game
7654,Play this game its amazing Watch out for kv2s any way have fun

7658,Feel like a mobile game. Should go straight to google store.
7659,Its nice
7660,"Honestly, just play War Thunder. Blitz can be fun, but it's taken a rather negative turn in my eyes simply because of the number of OP premiums and BS game mechanics War Gaming has added in recent months. Not to mention the game is indirectly P2W, where micro-transactions allow you to afford more credits, which allows you to fully equip your tanks faster. You also have the option to completely skip stock grinds or skip tanks entirely at the swipe of a credit card. Sure, the argument that WT does this as well can be made, but it's not nearly to the extent that Blitz does this. Furthermore, WT actually allows you to aim shots yourself rather than letting RNG decide if you hit / kill something. Overall, considering War Thunder is free, Blitz is just not worth getting into. Blitz is a good mobile game, but there are simply better options on PC."
7661,"This is one of the best games I've ever played, but... The community within this game is absolutely and unequivocally atrocious. Nearly everyone within the game is toxic to no extent. There are options to avoid such toxicity, such as blocking messages that are received from people that aren't friends, and blocking the in-game chat mechanics, but what's the fun in that. You get useful information from the chats, as well as slurs and toxicity. The game itself is amazing. It's well put together, has very good physics, especially for a mobile-ready game, and the choices for how to play the game are endless. The game is also difficult. It takes some getting used to. You must put some time in to learn each play style and find one that suits you. For most people, this takes too long. Most people give up on the game before finding their way to play due to the long hours you must put in to grind for each new tank. Choosing a line of tanks from the tech tree isn't easy, and most people choose incorrectly their first FEW times. If anyone would like a hand in learning anything in the game, and or some advice on how to do things within the game... My username in game is Kypai_2. You can contact me in any way you wish, and I will attempt to be as helpful as possible. Thanks for reading this review in it's entirety. Hopefully you've found joy in this game... I know I have."
7662,Good game that makes you work for success.
7663,"this game server is very unstable, especially asian server"
7664,"very addict, p2w too"
7665,"This game is for serious players and once you reach tier V, it will be a grind before you reach to the next tier. You have to spend money to get premium account for you to be able to have that ""quality"" experience. And then there's the match making where it will let you lose 30 to 50 battles in a row or for every 1 win you get, you get 5 loss. I would not recommend this game to anyone who is just looking to have fun."

I didn't even like tanks, or history for that matter, but I got it to play with a friend. It is not pay to win, and not unbalanced. There is nothing wrong with the matchmaker. This game is tons of fun because only abut 30% of it is shooting skill/the device you are using, and the rest is decision making and knowledge. This game is perfect for people who like strategy games."

7700,"if you have a high tolerance for bullshit and are prepared to accept that people who spend money on the game will just plain have an advantage over you, this is the strategy tank game for you. In my experience not spending money on this game is the equivalent to cock and ball torture in terms of enjoyability, only works on a very select group of people. The game is also a mobile game, meaning that the vast majority of players are underdeveloped fetuses that have gotten a hold of mommies phone. On top of that its a free game. So dont go in expecting a team game despite the fact that it is team based. Its more like a 1v13 where you can only damage 7 of the players."

7752,"This game is fun, the first couple of hours. Thats because youre playing against new people who just causually picked up the game. Win or lose, the battles always seem fair. But then you level up, then you get new tanks. And once you hit T5, or T6, the only people that are left in the game are the choads who pay to win, or those who hack. And hacking is a huge problem in the game. There is no effective way to report cheating subhuman pieces of shit. So that should be  red flag of its own, when the game tacitly condones cheating. Would I reccomend this game? No. But if you want to waste a few hours then delete the game in frustration because you arnt spending 30$ a day to keep up, or cheating to make up for your insignifigant life, then go ahead. The closer your get to T6, the more apprent this becomes. Play at your own risk."
7753,"This game is shocking. You work really hard to get good. The game appears to be infested with cheats who must be hacking the game. I  achieved a WR of just under 64. Then like a switch I could no longer win, no matter how well i played. Within a few days my WR was down to 59.70  You are put on a losing team or the enemy run around as if they are invisible. So they must know that they will win. Must be rigged or Hacked by cheats, advice do not play. Unless you are a cheating hacker."

7765,awsome game
7766,"I do not recommend this game to anyone. Absolutely everything is designed to make money, in an abusive way. And I don't mind paying for a good game!  ...but there are things here that are, at the very least, suspicious of fraud."
7767,its great but it trys it hardest to get you to buy things
7768,awesome
7769,"fu cking high ping always, my internet speed 200MBPS, i dont play agian this game"
7770,good game
7771,World of Tanks Blitz is a fun multiplayer game that anyone can play.  This game can be very in depth involving heavy strategy and coordination or can be a fun game to play a quick round or two.
7772,"A mobile game that was ported to pc, who wants to play this shit"
7773,damn nice
7774,Very good game
7775,good game
7776,"Easy to play, fast game, no need you 100% attention to play. Tanks are hard to customize but with time you will something acceptable."
7777,I like all tanks
7778,fun and casual
7779,not as good as world of tanks but ok
7780,"The game itself, is okay...
But the fact you constantly get pop ups, reminders etc about getting premium is just disgusting and ruins the whole experience..."
7781,This game is addicting but I wouldn't call it fun.
7782,"yes
pk"
7783,I need friends
7784,an real real time war machines battle. just try and love it...
7785,"The game's, Pay-To-Win, has some broken/OP tanks, and filled with way too many garbage teammates some of which i'm guessing are 9 year olds"
7786,simple and great game. its TANKS what else you want in life.
7787,UHUY
7788,"Really smooth, enjoyable and balanced gameplay!"
7789,World of Tanks Blitz is a great time passing game and just great for the intense game's you crave.
7790,no
7791,"Imagine your tank is a dartboard, The enemy shoots you in zone 1 which represents 1 damage but gets awarded 20 damage' you in turn shoot the enemy tank right in zone 20 which represents 20 damage however war gaming don't give you 20 they give 1 damage. You can aim as much as you like but sadly because of the game RNG the result is completely out of your control. I do love the game but RNG needs to be completely removed to make it a true fair and skill based game.."
7792,"I love the idea of this, it's the sort of game you can jump into for a bit of fun.  However if you want to progress  beyond VIII tanks then an inevitable paywall eventually retards all progress unless you are willing to grind yourself into oblivion.  That of course stops a fun game being fun."
7793,tanks
7794,Not a bad game .b ok if there was more points 4 ur kills.
7795,If you're ok with a stupidly toxic community and like grinding you'll probably enjoy this game.
7796,it rubbish would not recommend i lost all 93 minutes of progress out of the blue AND its boring at low tiers (which is most of the game) so no would not recommend
7797,"As a tank commander in real life, this game is a lot of fun"
7798,Trash

7801,"The biggest problem with this game is not the p2w tanks, but rather the players who think we should listen to them just because they have alot of battles on their record and usually talk alot of shit when they are the problem."

7807,.
7808,"[b]Well it's FREE.[/b]
All about tanks and fun to play along with lots of advertising and promotion. The Initial time is fun where its easy and simple to advance to next tier tanks, but as soon as you advance further it becomes tough if you don't have a premium pass.
It's more Complex than it looks, it has variety of tanks and bit of strategy and teamwork.
Overall it's Good Free game"
7809,same 2 maps again and again gets booring fast.
7810,"Not the best game I've ever seen, but not the worst either. I mean, if you want to play a good game with tanks, you choose World Of Tanks. I know, this one is more computer friendly and that's cool, but still. There could be so much more to help the game. Anyway, I recommend it becouse even if it's a low tier game, it's really enjoyable"
7811,"I really wish I could recommend this game, it was fun to play while I had free premium. Unfortunately, once you run out of premium, you start to lose money each time you fight in a battle unless you play really well. On top of that, higher tiers of tanks take much more money to buy and upgrade, as well as more money to play each match. Even worse, the game is constantly pushing ads for the ingame store and gamemodes only playable with higher tier tanks. At least it was fun while it lasted."
7812,meh
7813,"Really fun strategic team game. Started playing it around 2014 on mobile, then switched to PC when it became available. I would say it is hardcore pay to win but at the same time, if you got no skill or experience with the game then it doesn't matter if you pay or not. As long as you got a strategic approach and fairly good reaction time then the game will become more fun and you obviously win way more battle. On the other hand with no experience.. do not expect for it to be a breeze."
7814,It is an extremely fun game with lots of varieties of different tanks to enjoy but the company that owns it (Wargaming.net) is a greedy company and will offer you a lot of opportunities to purchase items that are not at all worth it
7815,"Its just an excelent game, and if u haven't played, i suggest u to."
7816,"This game have no sense. Beacause you cant even shoot enemy to hit him, beacause the game is for child who dont have a parents. Do not play this game and do not waste your time on this bullshit."
7817,"bad game 
all players are noob
and boring"
7818,yeahhhhhhh
7819,love this game. but lot of grinding for free to play players
7820,Fun to play with friends! I'm no longer play this game but I recommend it to others! 🙂
7821,"Последнее обновление добавило лагов. Раз в несколько секунд на 0,2-0,5 секунды замирает кадр, потом опять стабильно 60 фпс. Пробовал и на минимальных и на максимальных настройках, на ssd и на hdd дисках - результат один и тот же"
7822,good game
7823,Nice graphics and all but its a pay to win situation
7824,g
7825,"This game is the worst Pay-To-Win scam I've seen in ages.  The skills of other players will be the bane of your existence because 90% have the IQ of a rock with ears.  
If you are considering playing this dumpster fire of a game, take $100 out of your pocket and wipe your butt with it.  You'll get the same thing out of both."

7830,"i would recommend this game to people to people who don't like high quality graphics, but it is a super fun and enjoyable game."
7831,"Don't be fooled by the amount of steam hours I have.
I have played this game for over 5 years and I can safely say that it's far fairer than the main PC version and far more fun.
Every nation has decent tanks (unlike the main one with it's obvious Soviet Bias).
Also if you wish to spend a few pennies, the deals are sometimes nothing short of outstanding value.

8.5/10"
7832,Fun game but you need to really grind cuz tier 3 tanks are useless in front of people who grinded for long or people who have tier 4 tanks
7833,"God game! I like the 7 min round cap, it makes it easy to play a couple games when I have limited time."
7834,"I just like with the UI in game, but the price of items I just so it is very expensive."
7835,An eight of my soul has been taken by wargaming. i demand to have compensation of this loss via. reducing the amount of crates in the game
7836,This is a Solid PVP game. The harder you work the better you do. No payments necessary.
7837,"Pretty good game. I mean the only reason i wouldn't consider playing it is because of the option of buying tanks, especially since there's a Battle Pass, so why have the option to buy tanks at all. it creates an imbalance in the actual gameplay."
7838,.
7839,"u need create tactics and strategy to struggle w opponents, the best game in da world"
7840,I play this mainly on my phone and have no interest in higher tier so ymmv but this is a fun enough game. It's not super hardcore or challenging but it can be a fun and sometimes nerve wracking experience. Obviously there's the bog standard f2p stuff in this game and the grind can become... testing but it's all fun enough.
7841,its very fun when you wanna shoot at 10 year olds getting beat by there parents in there tanks
7842,the matchmaking is worse than Weimar Republic economy in 1923
7843,its really good fun after getting the hang of it!
7844,random noooob team this game is [ A waste of time and health ]
7845, game limits you to running duo platoons the grind is not fun most of the best tanks are pay to win there seems to be no MMR in the game so matches are unbalanced pretty much a all around waste of time no fun to be had ill give it a 1/10
7846,"i like the game alot great for playing with friend
"
7847,good game
7848,its a good game:)
7849,Idk its pretty pay to win
7850,"Positives: short battles (5-7 min) dont get you tied up where you cannot do other things. You do not have to spend money to get ahead, but it helps. Great game play, good graphics, and very good virtual physics. Secure so, as far as i know, no hackers.

Negatives: You are not always playing with mature individuals."
7851,fun
7852,.
7853,one of the best games so plz try it
7854,no
7855,This games is good but can Ping is low my internet is super speed but why my ping is bettt that its thx
7856,"Good, fun game!"
7857,cool
7858,"This game is fun at low tiers, but full of cheap players who intentionally block/use teammates as cover, last hitters, and other unsportsmanlike stuff at high tier. I finally uninstalled because i died for the 3rd time in 5 games to a teammate stopping me from moving into cover so he could use my destroyed tank as a vantage point. High tier playes make this game un-fun."
7859,"great game easy to play and over all just fun
"
7860,Very fun and fast paced
7861,Yes
7862,"good tank arcade game.
poor matchmaking logic, the worst"

7870,Very Good Game 10/10
7871,its fun even if you don't like violence.
7872,"ran into a couple  of bugs here and there, otherwise its a great game.. go for it :)"
7873,"Very Fun, realistic graphics and is cross-platform. what more could you want!"
7874,"World of Tanks Blitz
pros:
fast game with modern day graphics with easy controls that moves from location A to B to C and so on,
cons:
pay2win or pay for advantage.

7877,Great epic tank battles
7878,It only has two maps in you press Battle. You keep playing against obvious bots all the time. It's super 'pay or grind' to win.
7879,very fun
7880,Awesome game. Way more strategic than you may think.
7881,yes
7882,"This is another example of the long trend of releasing ""free"" pay to win games with piss-poor matchmaking. 
Pros: Cool tanks
Cons: Pay to win upgrades, forced into joining useless ""clans"" to experience ""top-tier"" content, horrid match-making and toxic players on all platforms. 
I've paid both the original and blitz and the engine behind the product is solid, but when you bump up to a new tank without paying for all the upgrades, retraining and equipment by using gold you get thrown on a team that you can expect at least 2 people to go afk or never load, and the rest drive around waving their turrets at random scenery. Then you watch your win/loss ration shoot rapidly downward as you experience the next 25 games on the constantly never improving side. 
If you don't pay and seek to ""get gud"" by joining a clan, expect every single one of these illustrious jerk factories to look at your stats and tell you to quit or start a new account with better stats.... 
I wouldn't recommend this game for casuals at all and not for 90% of hardcore players unless they like to chew on sandpaper.

EDIT: Came back and played more. Matchmaker still unbalanced - when are 7-0 win/loss battles even fun? Seems to be that RNGesus selects a team to win at the beginning and then follows through. I have been on both sides of the total crush win/loss and am still salty when I win. If you have OCD and are a sadist/masochist then you'll love this game."
7883,wtf is this shit doing on steam? Why not the desktop version?
7884,After playing AW for a while its nice t have a change.
7885,its easy to play!
7886,shitty ass updates.
7887,yes
7888,"I love how perfectly balanced this game is for a p2w game. You can enjoy the game just as much as one who would pay billions for it. Can't penetrate a tank? You don't have to. Just keep him there for your team, shooting at the tracks keeping him knocked down and watch him getting penetrated by your whole team ;) 

You could argue apcr and heat shells are p2w and makes the game uneven, but i'll disagree. They are balanced in their own terms. Apcr of your tier 10 might penetrate a tier 1, but it won't do shit. Sure, you can pay and get some advantage, but it's too costly to get a profit in the end and the advantage isn't even that big anyway.
Absolutely recommended, you just can't not have a good time with it, being cross platform you'll never not find a match under half a minute or so. Ded in one tank? Just play another in the mean time lmao. Efficiency is always important ;)"
7889,"You wanna know whats wrong with this game?
Teammates are so incompetent its a wonder they could even breath after coming out of their momma...when i do more damage than 70% of my team combined you know there is something rigged with the matchmaking!
Oh and also this one little OP tank:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeWPe4sxVCI"
7890,"I have played this game for about 5 years (on mobile not steam), and over the years the game slowly deteriorated. When you went into a battle you would see like one premium once in a while. But now, they are everywhere. Getting constantly bombarded with ""look at this premium tank"", or ""look at this one, only 60 dollars"" in the home screen. In battle its even worse when these premium tanks have some form of overpowered attribute in their their tier that literally make them pay to win. (Don't get me started on the Gravedigger). If you are looking for a nice, fun tank pvp, I suggest you keep looking because this game is only fun till you hit tier 4-5, and that will only take you a day to do so. With the toxic community, overpriced tanks, the abundance of overpriced tanks with OP attributes, this game is just not fun. Can't believe I wasted all of that time."
7891,"Its a really good game, Ive been playing since I was 9 years old, and as of right now Im 16, everyone says its a pay to play game, but that is very untrue, it just takes time, and you only pay if you are 1. Inpatient or 2. Not good at the game. Good job Devs!
"
7892,yes but ive seen better graphics and tank models and physics but its a mostly free game andfun to play
7893,meh
7894,"A hell of a lot of game, all for free.
The business model is generous - you just have to monitor your personal greed and impatience.

Love it."
7895,6k hours on this shit
7896,"Good game for novice war game players, good way to get familiar with the Big names in German, American and Soviet ww2 tanks, Game play is very easy and simple to learn, and the people here are not too competitive, if you are looking to move on to World of tanks proper or War Thunder this is a great start."
7897,its a fun game to play for free
7898,Awesome mobile version of WoT with all the advantages and weaknesses of its pc counterpart. The tech trees are a little different but a familiar item.

7927,The game will get you stuck for hours a lot of tanks to pick and its not pay to win its just needs some skill to maneuver the tank the  greatest thing at this game is the graphics even with low quality standards you will feel like your still playing it on high graphics fps are great too
7928,fun addictive game
7929,"Join the Steel Legion Clan, we bring havoc to enemy through relentless fury."
7930,"insane
"
7931,it is a fun tank game is really cool i recommend it
7932,"This game should be an EA title because i'm genuinely disgusted with the ammount of pay to win involved. If you want a good game to kill time, don't even try this one, it will not reward you in any way and only hits you hard on the head to try and force you into spending money with special vehicles that end up defeating the purpose of playing, given you can simply buy your way straight into the top tier and not even bother getting through a tech tree. 0/10, barbie games are more worth of your time than this."
7933,"Lots of tanks real and imaginary. Games are quick thus the name Blitz, sometimes frustrating but a lot of fun. It is a polished game and the quick nature suits me better than the PC World of Tank.

7940,"Used to enjoy this a lot more, but as of right now it's kinda plagued by wacky fake tank premiums that are incredibly annoying and always driven by the most insufferable bastards of human history. If you have one of them on your team, be prepared to watch them cuss your team out and leave 8 seconds into the game. This goes for all games, but don't feel obligated to keep playing this through the trash community, painful to face prem tanks etc etc. The absolute top priority in games should be your own sanity and how much fun you're having."
7941,GOOD
7942,YES
7943,"cool
"
7944,Good and fun game played it since 2016. i re downloaded it on steam this year. Although has a lot of in game purchases and some are for tanks that are way OP so pretty much pay 2 win but other than that i still could enjoy the game.

Don't bother spending money for pay to win, if you are good you still win without it.
If you suck, pay to win doesn't help you.

7964,"easy to learn and hard to master.  Game play well balanced, but many choices available to the player to customize the experience to their skills and liking"
7965,"As a free-to-play arcade game with a unique flavor, it's fine. Don't be lured in by the urge to spend money, and be sure to stick to the lower tiers, and there's a decent amount of dumb fun to be had here."
7966,great game. players need to work as a team..
7967,"This is a slow and good game to play. Yet it gives players time to adapt and learn during the course of hundreds even thousands of battles.
"
7968,fun
7969,"this game is honestly like a drug addiction
you try to stop
you sucessfully stopped the addicition
then after few months you come back"
7970,GOOD GAME
7971,"would be cool with AI, but with other players..........a retarted AI would do better"
7972,GOOD GAME SO FUN  if you like tanks and battleing you will love this game
7973,faster paced gameplay than the other world of tanks. kills alot of time lol
7974,Its a really fun game for the people who like quick thinking strategy that can change the tide of the game.
7975,I like the variety of tanks that you can pick and choose from. The one dislike is how grindy some of them can be.
7976,This game is very intense and at times frustrating but strategy and well setup communication between platoon and team mates and it gets very interesting. You have to grind very hard to acquire different tanks and items but if you're looking for a game to spend hours and days scrapping for a single vehicle to earn and like the hardcore grinding system I recommend this game for you as it's that gaming style. If you want all the items and things handed to you and don't like to dig yourself in a solid position and strategically fight and you like to rush things thinking your a god of war and are unbeatable then this game is definitely not for you. You can create and build your own setup for each classed tank and run in a platoon with friends or even create a clan and fight for resources and build yourself up to fight and participate in events. The story mode is interesting and well setup for you to learn some great views on characters and tanks while offering an easier route than PvP. Overall I give this game a 7/10 rating for what it is and the only things I don't like is the matchmaking and the nerfing of some tanks when they were setup and made to be hard to take down irl for certain reasons. I hope this review helps others and allows a more open view to how this game really is and not for what it looks like.

UPDATE: Revisited this game to give it another try, and it's even worse. I couldn't play a game at all without having to first 'buy resources'. 

Don't waste your time on this, this is strictly a cash grab by Wargaming."

8003,"In short:

   1) This game is a pure P2W game, period. Check out https://www.blitzstars.com/toptanks and select tier 8: all the top tanks are premiums.

   2) Every week a few premiums are available in the shop, but only for a few days (ah, the good old commercial argument ""hurry up to buy before the deal is gone"").

  3) Most new premium tanks are sold via ""gamble"" crates: you buy crates and hope that the tank you want is inside. Good luck with the lottery,

  4) When they sell a tank for a fixed price (real money or gold, which is roughly speaking the same...), WG always mentions HUGE discounts. But I still have to see a tank sold without such a huge discount... => These discounts are nothing else than a commercial lie. 

  5) New premiums tanks are released at a frenetic rate... At the same time, new maps are slow to be introduced.

  6) Count 30€ for a decent premium, much more (>100€) for a very good one.

In short: P2W, very expensive if you want to be serious, and repetitive.

8005,Just fun!
8006,its free and fun
8007,"Don't waste your time or money, the more you spend, the more frustrating the game becomes. It's Vegas rules, house always wins, and trolls insult your play, making you think you need to spend more to win. Join with a friend and its more fun. And I have been playing this game for 5 years, it has only gotten worse."
8008,"just fun game
"
8009,"This is more of a arcade style tank brawler

If you want more depth and simulation type combat, go with War Thunder

For even more hardcore simulation, go with DCS World

Graphics - 10/10 - (can be easily adjusted to your preferences)
Game Mechanics - 8/10 (lots of game mode variety, but once the missions are all over, there's nothing left to do.) 
Gameplay - 5/10 {if the player has brains, it's easy to play but very competitive}
Multiplayer - 0/10 (They promote teamwork, but only plats 2 players, No proper voice communications, a recent update limited the chat range, and no team balance)
Ingame Progression - 10/10 (Very fast to reach Tier 10 however, getting there fast means you lack the experience to master the tank)
Ingame Currency - 2/10 (Credits are very difficult to obtain, the legendary camos are worth spending on, other than that this game is a liability, save your money, and invest it on assets)

8038,"Man, this game was fun at first. But there is a reason for bad review. I'm gonna list out the issues I have.

Alright, time to identify some issues. First is premium ammo. It's too expensive. I could load so many AP shells out of 1 single Pramo round. It's the only way to defeat the heavy tanks, and the OP premiums (Another problem) is the only solution, other than going around and losing all your hit points, is pramo. War gaming could make it cheaper, but no. They push you to the gold shop to buy credits, so you somewhat have a chance of winning.

Another issue, or two, is power creeping and OP premiums. The stock tech tree is slowly getting phased out. Why grind for that iconic Tiger I when you can free XP your way up? The only way to fight the OP premiums is with the heavy and tank destroyers from the tech  tree, without spending too much money, or none at all if you have the patience. Then there is the premium issue. Why use tech tree when you can pay 20 DOLLARS for some tank that is really good, and give you a solid boost over everyone else. Tanks that come to mind are the IS-5, Skorpion G, and Lowe. Tanks that are too powerful, and dominate the free to play people. It's just not worth the money, I could go get a really good indie game for 20 dollars. Funny thing is, War Gaming once implemented a solution. Instead of making the tank have good stats, give it a credit boost for each victory, or XP boost. Instead of the person buying a premium, and everyone else struggling to fight it, it would be a normal tank with normal stats that could fit in perfectly in the tech tree. Unfortunately the community did not show too much interest, so that idea is down the drain. Another thing is I can only play at tier 8, because at tier 9, no matter what I do, I still lose credits after every battle. The only alternative is the GOLD SHOP.

OK, still reading this? Here is the next issue then. Some really OP premium tanks come in crates. These crates are practically gambling. When you buy a bunch, you only get a 2% drop chance for one. If you got 5, you would think you have a 10% chance right? WRONG. When you open a crate, you have to single it out. 2% drop chance each crate. YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO ADD PERCENT CHANCE TOGETHER. You always see people buying lots of crates, yet they still only get some XP boosters. They easily could've gotten free XP if they wanted. They want a proper tank, not something worthless and easy to get, like XP. 


Third, and we are not done yet, is playerbase, and War Gaming failing to help it. We all have those days where we just go on a losing streak because of bad teams. The tutorial failed at saying what you should do in certain tanks. Heavys should not camp in bushes. Lights should not rush and die in the first minute. It's either a play how you want strategy or a better tutorial. The toxicity in the chat and the people who rage annoy me. I once killed some one, and they kept spamming in the chat I was a nub. It's funny at first but it gets really tiring after a while. The report system doesn't work very well, with yes, good service, but bad punishments, that you can just brush off. 


Well, you just read the entire list of flaws. Just don't spend money. It's either over priced, or gambling. You should not spend money on a slowly dying game, because that money will just go to waste. It will not help you in the long run. These flaws are slowly creeping up on us, and will eventually ruin the game. It all started before I joined, 5.5 update. The tanks gone, shoved into collector, and the power creeping, slowly but surely. Blitz is lost. A good run, some decent profit. I only still play because of my clan."
8039,fucking shit game cause someone who bought a really strong tank can fuck your day up because they bought a better tank. fucking shit pay to win game that is not worth it at all. If you enjoy paying for a good tank to fuck everyone up then this is the game. but if you dont wanna put in money they make you grind for fucking hours to get a ok tank and you still get fucked by someone using a pay to win tank cause it can actually do damage to your tank unlike your shitter tank that you earn. Among the worst pay to win games
8040,una poronga
8041,"Game is fun and quick to learn.  Do not need to be a credit card warrior, just enjoy levelling at your own pace and working your way through those awesome tanks!"
8042,Very najs

8044,"this is the best game EVER!!
"
8045,Great fun this game. Hone your craft at the lower lvls then slowly make greater tanks.
8046,"A good game that tests your skills against other players from around the world. The game is free; you don't have to spend money, but certain tanks are worth it."
8047,"I think War Thunder is better.
1. More realistic.
2. More vehicles.
3. Mixed battles (Tanks and planes)
World of tanks is unrealistic It has HP and at long ranges where you should see the tanks sometimes they are invisible. Also you can take only one tank into the battle unlike war thunder where you can take many."
8048,"Yikes, just play world of tanks by wargaming instead"
8049,If the normal World of Tanks is not really your skill level then this game will be the one for you
8050,uraaaa
8051,I like pancakes with jam which unfortunately don't exists in this game but apart of that game is awesome. If you like to make it your main game be prepared to spend some money otherwise progress will be slow and you will be frustrated loads of times.

8059,"Sometimes hard to grind and master, but definitely addictive reduced version of the full version of WoT."
8060,"Funny and quick, acceptable graphics"
8061,"The game play is great.  7 minute matches, good tank combat, different tank classes, strategy.  It's all pretty good. What I don't like is because it's free to play there are menus that pop up all the time asking you to buy stuff, the first few matches the game forces you to purchase items and you feel like you're being guided down a path that teaches you how to pay.  It's not pay to win but it's all annoying.  What finally brings me to the ""No, I don't recommend"" is the fact that once I got my Tier V tank and unlocked the ability to apply a como/skin is that you buy it for that ONE tank.  I haven't spent money on the game and had a few hundred gold coins just from playing and bought a skin, equipped it in my tank, then went to another to equip it only to see that I'd have to buy it again.  The game just feels really greedy.  I'm not opposed to buying skins in games, I'm actually surprised they don't let you do that at level one tanks from the start, but asking me to buy a skin/cammo for each tank is just too much."
8062,the graphic are so bad for pc pls don't get this game
8063, it is free and you can bring it on the go. you could play the game when waiting in lines or at the airport. and you can join a community of tankers.
8064,Wanna play this game? Do you like tanks? IF yes then hop in. One of the best PvP tank games out there.

8073,"Pay to win. Just look at the Smasher for example. Game now full of gambling via loot boxes at extortionate prices. Even the gambling is rigged like the Chieftan Christmas Fair scam. Matchmaking is rigged by average damage if you say anything bad about WG. They don't do anything about bott users or serial afkers even if you send them video evidence. Customer support is a monkey sending random copy/paste responses. No innovation = T55A - T54 anyone. WG refuses to listen to players and puts $$$ first, which is why player numbers are at an all time low. Find another game by a decent developer"

8077,Its a fun game but at higher tiers it becomes a tedious grind. Though when you play with an active clan its not so bad. If you don't want to spend some cash here and there; it will be tough without the free experience.
8078,it goooooooot
8079,Nice Shot :)
8080,"its gameplay is great but once you reach tier 7 it gets a bit pay-to-win however if you ignore the OP tanks and get skilled at the game then it does get really fun

Edit: only tier 7 is slightly pay to win IMO, and even then its only due to 2 tanks (smasher and annihilator), which can still be beaten using the various tech tree (free) tanks in the game. But once in tier 8 these over powered tanks become easy prey. Tiers 9 and 10 are IMO the most balanced in the game, they lack any really ""bad"" tanks and they lack any really ""overpowered"" tanks. 

I would just like to end this review with some tips for new players:
- watch youtubers, i cant stress enough how important this is, some of the youtubers i personally recommend would be Pantoufleee, Meadsy69, FugitBlitz and maybe watch some of bushkas old videos (bushka doesnt upload blitz content anymore as far as i know)

-take your time, grind multiple lines at once so you dont get to the higher tiers with only 500 battles and get stomped by more experienced players aswell as potentially being a burden for your own team 

-focus mostly on medium and heavy tank lines as those are the most newbie friendly. The ones i would recommend for new players are the E100, IS7 M48 patton, E50M, 60TP and progetto 65 lines (those are the tier 10s at the end of those lines) I would also recommend going for the OBJ. 268 line and T110E4 line for tank destroyers. After a while maybe you want to learn light tanks, then i would recommend the XM551 sheridan and Vickers Light lines (vickers first though, as the lines tanks are kinda like medium tanks) 

-Stay away from enemy Kv2s because those will demolish you in tiers 5 and 6, but they are vulnerable for about 20s after they shoot (the KV-2 takes around 20s to reload its massive gun) 

-other vehicles you dont want to get shot by includes, but is not limited to: ISU-152, Smasher, Annihilator, SU-152, WT auf. Pz. 4, Jagdpanzer E100, Fv215b 183, Fv4005 and the KV-2 of course 

-Dont rush in or yolo in only to get killed within 1 minute flat, it doesnt help you, or your team. Only the enemies.

-Learn about the different Shell types. Link to a couple of helpful videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNbwLrvjOQo    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT7IKucgsC8

-capture bases in supremacy modes

-dont capture the base in regular

-learn about spaced armour and how angles work, how to ""sidescrape"" and how to go ""hull down""

-Only go into battle if you are able to play, so if you are on the train like 3 minutes away from your stop dont go into a battle because the battle might go on for 4 minutes and you have to leave, so your team suddenly is 1 tank down and at a disadvantage

-Only go into battle with relatively stable internet, basically the same reasoning as the last one

-dont be toxic please, there are already plenty of toxic people in chat and i think most people want it to improve, so dont just start insulting someone for 3 minutes straight just because they ammo racked you (insta killed by getting a critical hit on the ammo rack, fun to do it to enemies, not so fun when it happens to you)

-report overly toxic, trolling or people breaking any other rules by using wargamings ticket system on their website (the in game ""report"" or ""downvote"" system doesnt work very well)

-dont buy crates, should be obvious, but the amount of people i see getting mad about not getting anything valuable after spending a bunch of money on crates is crazy

-dont buy high tier premium tanks unless you have at least 3 or 4 tech tree tanks in the same tier already, and have gotten decent and confident at that tier

-dont be one of those players who treat winrate or average damage as the be-all end-all of the game. While it is good to have good stats, it shouldnt be as important as people make it out to be (but still try to keep your winrate around 50% or higher as people might get toxic about having a less than 50% winrate and it is a decent way of knowing if you are doing well or not)

-have fun, it is a game after all (as long as its not to the detriment of your teammates or breaks any rules, because there are people who have fun trolling/blocking teammates or being super toxic and they are the scourge of the earth and should get banned)

this was quite lengthy and took a long time to write, but these are some of the more important things i had to say, and there are a lot more things to mention like: knowing how various tanks are played, reading the lineup, reading the minimap, knowing the rough stats of every vehicle etc.

but as stated earlier: have fun and enjoy the game 


(i forgot to talk about special gamemodes, but talking about them would double the length of this review)








"
8081,j;k; awe some !111!!!!gjgf recommend u to play dis
8082,"Hi!

The game is good, you can play it even in really bad laptops (like mine) and it will run nicely, the tanks are well made, there's a lot of customization which gets ""refreshed"" every month and it's easy to learn the basics 

However, i've quit it after two years of playing because the game has become kinda unplayable, armor doesn't matter since it's all RNG (Randomly generated whether you'll penetrate or bounce), you can have +200mm of armor and get mauled by a bunch of much smaller tanks from the front, there's also a few bugs like ghost shells (shells that directly hit but disappear and do no damage)

The worst part of the game are the teams, as soon as you start winning a bit and get a decent or good winrate you'll get paired with people MUCH MUCH worse so that the match is balanced, which is fair, but what isn't fair is that these people have 0 map awareness, 0 reaction time and think rushing in and going 1 vs 5 is a valid pro strategy, worst of all  the playerbase is insanely toxic and salty, like, it makes league of legends look good, every match has at least one or two guys cussing at each other.

It's a good game, put please, don't get too attached to it, take care of yourself, go for a walk or get in touch with some friends, anything is better than this game,"
8083,"a fast fun game with humor, but match making is a pain."

8088,"i played the game for 6 years 
first of all its very toxic and pay to win 
Devs dont listen to player they do ask and we as a player say something but they never listen 
their response is this tank is balanced because stats shows it but in reality good player take advantage of this and beginner have hard time playing whit the tank thats why stat shows its balanced 
plus u can pay for overpowered tanks 
if u wanna have fun get good but its very hard in this very toxic community or whit good player untill u get good so u can be carried by a pro

8113,"Well this is pay to win game, but dont worry, you can stiil play the game without spending any cent like me, it took me about 546.3 hours to get a free premium tanks and collectable tanks and tier 10 tanks, and you can get free 10 gold every single ads you wacth

So This Is A Good Game,  in fact  i'm not recommended this game because its pay to win unless you are a patient person"
8114,"Its a great game. Its not a pay to win game even tho people say it is, they just suck at. Premium tanks don't make it stronger, it just means you get more credits per battle than regular tanks. People do tend to talk smack to you after battle when you make a mistake or they think you did, so i recommend to keep a filter on so only your friends could text you if you are sensitive. sometimes people are very forgiving and are fun after an argument. sometimes wg makes bad matchmakings, but that adds on to your experience on how you handle those disadvantages. just plz dont be those people who steel kills from others, if their reload takes a long time and theyre about to die, then youre allowed to take ze kill. dont block anyones shots by driving directly infront of then. if you are heavily armored, be a shield for people who dont and have lower health. dont stay behind your teammate if there are enemies ahead so youre they have enough space to retreat. just dont be toxic and you wont receive much backlash from others"
8115,Quite good
8116,"a friend played this  and i was forced to play with him some times..





































he has 600 hours on this shit"
8117,without prem tanks and prem account you make little to no creds regular wot's isn't this horribly bad of a cred grind. a win in my kv1 I did over 1k damage with prem account and didn't even make 10k creds that's without firing prem ammo as well. only decent thing about this game is the lack of stupid arty. with prem having done 2100 dmg in my pz4g beating on tier 6's i didn't even make 30k. and you can't say it's not p2w when it gives the option to INSTA join tier 10 if you wanna spend 25k gold
8118,if you are looking for a game that involves battling in tanks and having fun with out out having to pay if you don't want to look no further than world of tanks blitz over the past 3 years of playing this game it just amazes how war gaming take this game to the next level as they have even added hit markers in so if you are all about realism that just click install on this game
8119,ok
8120,PLAY AND ENJOY
8121,"I love this game so much. It's my bread and butter shooter MMO tank game. 
Pros:
-Fun and fast-paced tank shooting 5v5 MMO.
-Great and rewarding events.
-Cheap and very generous Battle Pass.
-Frequent Updates

Cons:
-Pay to Win more games, but can be outplayed with skill.
-Graphics are outdated, but are slowly improving with time.
-Maps are limited, but plenty more than you would need.
-grind is as expected, but can be sped up with premium account (Given for free from a lot of events)

Over all a really fun and quick game to play and have some tanking fun. BETTER that World of Tanks PC at the moment. The community is thriving and doing so much better than ever before, PLUS, Wargaming seems to be listening more to the Blitz community and updates are making the game better and better!

8128,"MMnya semakin parah, apalagi pas di regular battle"
8129,Poor matchmaking and poorer support. Great visuals and nice maps. Player base is about standard for a fighting game. I would say play it but don't spend a penny on it till you have ground out a tier 7 or 8 vehicle. If at that point you still haven't pulled out most of your hair enjoy. And thats if you love tank games. For an average gamer testing the waters I would try something else.

And all of this because of some ""very"" simple reason.
My general PoV:
The maturity this game once had is dead and now it's just a shell for kids who like to spend 300 euros per month on the premium tanks they make every once or two weeks where they are still not getting creative with the fake names. 
Competitiveness left when tier 10 premium tanks were added and more and more offers appeared in the shop. Most serious people left the game as soon as they saw where it was heading but I stayed like the sucker I was 2 years ago. 
The sad and cunning trap these games have is that they make you think your effort in the game counts towards something and if you stop playing you will lose it. After getting 2 tier 10 tanks and a notable amount of premium tanks I came to the realization that the grind is just endless, there is no endgame even if you complete all tech trees, because they will just keep adding more tanks to keep people in the game. 
I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game about 4 times and every time I played it again was in the hope that for once I could have fun. I'm not one of those salty kids who keep blaming their own team when they die first, but the competitive matchmaker and the matchmaker overall don't care about player skill, only for the tank you have. So it's very easy to get matched with someone that has 30-40% WR only because he has a shop tank so that the teams would have a relevant amount of diversity in terms of tank types. 
The ""endgame"":
The meta of this game is either a tech tree tank that takes 4 months to grind or a tier 10 premium tank that occasionally appears in the shop for about 75 euro. It's not like they sell these tanks to fulfill their upkeep costs, but it seems more like milking at this point. I've seen it in many other games and I know what it feels like. 90% of the people you will find as your teammates are toddlers and in a game that requires communication to win makes it clear you can't really depend on someone like that who will just go die only because he didn't want to do what you told him, he lacks common sense and so does the community at this point. 
The youtube community:
Most YouTubers I've seen playing this are not really having fun of it, it may seem like they are having fun but what they had when they first started making videos was gone after a while and was replaced with an advertisement puppet. All this of course is nothing but my pure opinion on what this game has become. 
Conclusion:
It could have been something great if we didn't stick at the mobile plan, because it's the universal truth that free mobile games want to milk your wallet in the end and that's an unhealthy practice at pc gaming. I have found a better community than this at a more fun game of which I won't mention because I'm not an advertiser. If you want a good game and community just look elsewhere, because, ""You picked the wrong house, fool!""."
8142,Fun game
8143,"Once you understand that this is a port from mobile you will understand why it plays/looks/feels the way it does. To be real honest it feels wrong playing this game on PC considering it looks like you are fighting along side/against people that are playing on mobile. Can't say I was ever that good at this game (or the actual WoT), but when you put this game infront of me with a keyboard and mouse...........Good bye everyone else on the other team. Oh, I'm the only one left on my team and they have a full team. I guess I'm in for a not so hard challenge. Just turn off your brain when you play this and you will be fine. I use this game to kill time between college classes."
8144,col
8145,yes                  yes
8146,"I've put about 3000 hours into this game and spent maybe $1000 on pixels. But you know when a game's crap but you invested so much time into you just can't let it go? This is it. Noobs, laggy servers, pay 2 win but very addictive. 9/10"
8147,WoT without the annoying Arty players
8148,Very fun.
8149,Fast furious game. I love it. Normal wot is too slow
8150,"Wotb is a great game, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone. Also You can play this game with your friends on mobile even if you are on pc which is just great because I used to be a mobile player for years and I could still play with My friends on pc. Wotb has the right mixture of Real tank battles and the fantasy of Videogames which makes the  game really fun to play. Another Great thing about this game is that You can still manage to do well in games against people who have paid money for extra things in the game, and although alot of people are calling this game pay to win, I dont really think so, because whenever I come up against one of those tanks that people have paid for,  it's not really like an unfair fight. I can think of 1 or 2 tanks that are pay to win, but mostly it's not. One last thing is that they have events that can give away free premium tanks and things like that that you usually have to pay for, and that is huge, because then free to play players can have the chance to enjoy some premium things that you have to pay for, all you have to do right now is earn it by playing hard. That's all I have to say. I hope to see you on the Battlefield, Tanker."
8151,its fun arcady tank sim not as hardcore a dcs or warthunder but still fun

8160,"I am choosing to write this review after reading other reviews of WoTB, seeing what people have wrote out of their own anger at the game I want you too see the actual side of this game, and why in reality you shouldn't listen to those people who say 'oh the company is greedy' 'they rig the games to make you lose if you don't spend money' 'oh no people so toxic in the chat' 'i hate this game so rigged', first of all I'd like to make a point, the company is hardly greedy, yes you can complain they want money almost everything they sell is for real money, but you have to remember that, they are a company, and every company has to make money from somewhere, also not everything you have to pay for, the company make countless of free to play events where you can get tanks for free easily by just playing the game a few times a day for a week or so, this includes recent events at the time writing the review where we could get the Pz.IV Gargoyle for free just by winning 20 battles in a week, that's just about 3 wins a day, easy, and free, not so greedy there huh ? Also we had the Kunze panzer event where you could get the kunze panzer for free, a week after the Pz.IV Gargoyle event, this one required some skill, but was easily do able, you still think the company only want money and won't do anything for free angry reviewers ? And also people who say there is rigged matchmaking has got to be the worst pick out of Wargaming I have ever seen, seriously ? Just because you didn't win a couple of games you think 'random matchmaking' which selects players at complete random on each team and only pairs the equal amount of tanks classes on each team is rigged ? You don't seriously think someone sits there typing out who you get on your team and if you win or not do you ? They honestly don't care if you have a bad day in terms of winning because half the time, it's your own fault if you win or not! there are 7 players on each team, that means each player does about just under 15% of the job to win, you know 15% is a lot when looking at it, so if you do bad then that's going to have a bad outcome on the games ending, I can guarantee you that about three quarters of the people who come here to leave a bad review are young children who lost for a bit and want to take their anger out here and blame the company for something they obviously can''t control (your skill and, how you do, and how every single player is and what that player does) but what they can do is offer help and tips, before ranting and having a bash out on the company maybe go watch some of the YouTubers tutorials and tactical videos, I can assure most people here who are angry could be much better off watching a 20 minute video on some crucial basic mechanics of the game. Another thing I've seen here, is people taking it out on luck or as we WoTB players call it 'RNG', yes RNG is pure luck but honestly all you gotta do is aim properly and wait for your aim circle and not take impossible shots and expect them to hit and penetrate the opponent, okay yes once in a while RNG will mess you up a bit and you'll do something which really should not have been like that, but is it the end of the world, no! Of course it isn't you missed a single shot, we all do once in a while what's the big deal anyway, and plus your forgetting luck or 'RNG' can act in your favor a lot of times, and trust me it happens more than you think.

Carrying on from people complaining it's Pay 2 Win (P2W) it's not. Clearly demonstrated by one of the world greatest players called HisRoyalFatness it isn't, he has played over 72,000 battles and has not spent a single penny on the game, yet he is where he is now, one of the best players in the world. I will admit to those people who are complaining that the game has it's angry moments, but honestly the good moments out-rule the bad ones, and I'd suggest to anyone playing that if they want to have more good moments to watch some tutorials on the game by the YouTubers (such as Droodles on Blitz, Pantoufleee, Meadsy ect:) and learn from there trust me you won't regret it.

Also if you came here to find out if you should try the game and get into it, then yes. First of all it's free and there's no harm in trying. I would definitely recommend to anyone out there, also the system requirements don't require anything too special.    

Thank you for taking your time to read my review I hope you choose to listen to this over some other negatives people have written, thank you."
8161,"It's fun, easy to use, and better on PC. A lot of devices can run this, but there is something to it that just makes it better here."

8169,@_@ grat game
8170,"Even tho i'm not good still super fun to drive songs
"
8171,Quite Fun
8172,The skill/weapon/tank/upgrade/etc trees are unbelievably non intuitive. Kill steals are so common (unintentional or intentional I don't know). Some tiers of tanks don't even have enough players to start a game.
8173,"Not enough players in game... 7 minutes in queue... Then less than 1 minute gameplay... Once you get to tier V and you face the big guns, you have 0 chance to stand against higher tier, or even same tier tanks but with improvements that will take you 50 matches to reach... unless you open your wallet and... you know P2W."
8174,"I hate the fact that they keep adding non-historical, fan-fiction, science fiction tanks to the game that look like frankenstain inventions of some guy that thinks adding them and paying less attention to historical tanks and prototype tanks is a good idea. I had some fun in the start but bro like legit more than 1/3 of the tanks that u will face are like robot tanks n shiet. Why dont u just become the mini version of the real World of Tanks PC that we all love n hate ofc it also has problems regarding balance and matchmaking but its kinda playable. Had some fun in wot blitz but its more pain and u need to grind a lot to achieve something and without gold ur basically stuck at 0 position. Best of luck"
8175,fun and not a knockoff

8187,very interesting game when u play as the soviet ur tanks move faster than light
8188,Fun game for all ages
8189,it cool

8194,"It's a fun game, I mean when you get higher its a pain but its fun from the start if you don't want to pay for anything."
8195,Freezes a lot : much more in recent weeks
8196,"This game is epic. Great realism, great combat, great gameplay dynamics. I play the same kinds of battles over and over again and just keep coming back for more. To progress in the game is to reach an elite status the equal to which I have never felt in any other game. I fully recommend. Happy tanking!"
8197,"Really enjoyable, i really recommend this game for players who likes entertainment in real life."
8198,"Its a very very good free game! I love how it is good but not violent, please install this game!"
8199,Its fun for the first 4 or 5 tiers but then you start being called a noob and it feels like your grinding. Fun with a friend.
8200,pog
8201,fun
8202,this is awesome for a person who generally likes the military
8203,so good is a commplicated game to build up states hard to get iX and X those are had but it's so good even old versions and the new this is a aswome game!
8204,a toxic hell
8205,"Извиняюсь,  но это пиз@ец. Аудитория игры - неуравновешенные люди, которые тебя либо оскорбляют, либо специально сливают бои. Про оптимизация - вообще молчу.

8206,Good vehicle mashing. Good community. It is alright for small mash em.
8207,great game runs on my 6 year old laptop and the graphics are decent
8208,its great
8209,"     This game as many have said before is really a outdated pos, I played the game a long time ago on Xbox one and the game was actually quite fun, years later firing it up on pc and its nothing like what I remembered, horrible sound quality, horrible graphics, 99 percent of the time I have a full team of ""players"" that are clearly badly programmed bots that can't hit a shot over 4 ft standing still, the pay to play portion of the game is basically not even worth it when your playing against nothing but bots. I think the fact that this game has realistic WW1 and WW2 tanks it could have became a good game, BUT paired with tanks de-spawning once their 20 ft away and the ridiculously horrible skins you can get on the tanks really break the immersion that your in a battlefield, not even mentioning the 3 bot team mates I have sitting in a bush the whole game shooting at the tank 15 ft away and missing then blowing up.

Overall I think this game has potential but as it sits now I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemies.

Do you recommend this game?
NOOOOOOOOO

"
8210,absolutely the best tank game around!!:)
8211,Be ready to cough up some cash!
8212,its ok i guess
8213,Yes
8214,depends on you personally i think war thunder does a much better job at simulating realism and tank battles however they are often slow and 1sided as 1side has better tanks by along shot. world of tanks is a more fast paced easier to learn game and i enjoy it for that but i just dont see myself investing 300+hours into this like i did WT
8215,It's an alright game. I don't enjoy it but it seems pretty well made
8216,"Pay2Win w 2 slowach, bez konta premium i czolgow premium nie przetrwasz powyzej 6 tieru..

Game is Pay To Win, i have more than 17k battles and i want leave out becouse my teams is made with idiots/monkeys/clowns/no brain humans.. verry frustrating NOT RECOMEND
Match Making is  good example how this game is bad..
Last time i see many bots players with 0 (ZERO) battles on tiers 7-10.
Shi tty Matchmaking kill all game and fun !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
8217,a really fun and amazing game and its free
8218,forever loved
8219,"3 gigabyte, what am i expecting?"
8220,"Great looking game, built around a fantastic concept. The implementation is horrible, though - the MatchMaker that puts players on each team is programmed to put the highest ranked players on the same team. (The publisher denies this, but the XVM mod group has pretty definitively proven it via statistical analysis.) If you're one of the better players, great - you get to run up your stats vs. tomatoes. But it makes for a LOT of blow-out matches that, frankly, aren't much fun for either side. There are much better options out there."
8221,Great game when you do high damage but warning: may cause frequent aggressive behaviour due to noob teammates and toxc players in chat
8222,"Spent 400 hours on this game. Not worth it, I regret wasting every single second wasted  this on peice of shit game. Yeah, the game is pay2win- buy a tank and u will have better and easier time bouncing shots getting kills and destroying everyone, furthermore the game is completely broken - aim for 5-10 seconds just to get a ghost shell (shell disappearing and not hitting anything) or just get a stupid bounce of a track damage for 0 damage. But this would all be fine for me, but one thing is what i kept raging on my whole time playing it- the community. I am shocked that there are people who have over 10K battles ( I have roughly 4k in 400 hours meaning these players spent over 1K hours on average and still being able to hit 1 shot per game on average making them have 400 and less average damage in tier 10 where the lowest tanks have 2k dmg/game average. Playing with these players is extremely demotivating as you see them die doing nothing while they completely ignore anything the team says them to do. With a player like this, your team ends up having to carry and do damage he should have done to try to save the game and win. Another type are players with obviously very sad life as they have from 20-80K games thinking they are the best and calling everyone noob/bot/moron while they are nothing better. 
In conclusion if you are reading this PLEASE never download this game as you will never have a good experience, and you will end up regretting ever playing it as I do right now."
8223,This game could be good if they fixed the fact that paying to win in this game can get you vehicles that are so stupidly op that just them being on a team can grant you a free win. (edit) 550 hours later. Still the same crap.
8224,boyo game
8225,"Great game,easy to play,you dont need high performance PC !"
8226,"Unicum enemies, monkey teammates. EVERY FUC-KING MATCH."
8227,A Great game if you have good teamates.
8228,"This game is one of my personal fav. free to play model type games I played in recent history.  Unlike other bad free to play models this game allows you to continue to advance and enjoy the game without premium ""Pay"" purchases although at a much slower and grind way.  There are of course pushes temps players to spend money to buy premium services and digital content but I never felt that I had to purchase these items in order to enjoy the game and/or advance.  I have personal spent some money on the game as I played the game for many hours but I did so more out to reward the company for putting together an enjoyable game more then I had to have something in the game.

The game has some items which I would want to improve and the devs seem to be trying to continue to advance the game and keep it fresh.  This is done though many special events they run and through constant review of the game mechanics and statistics to try to keep balanced matches.  One thing I would like is to be able to team up with more then one player.  I understand why they resist allowing larger teams but I personally would find it more enjoyable to setup a team of players I know.  This would bring a new element of coordination and strategy that is currently not present in the game and make the matches more dynamic, epic and enjoyable.  It would require of course more controls of match making but I believe with some testing it could be accomplished. One of the worse parts of the game is the risk of being teamed up with bots or trolls who have no interest in playing the game as intended.

I would recommend this game to anyone to try especially those who like on-line team shooters like counter strike.  I personally play this with my father and we use it to stay in touch and have fun together.  Great game and I plan to continue to play it in the future."
8229,Yes
8230,world of wallets
8231,world of tanks in better
8232,"very nice, updates occasionally break connection, but that's likely due to just my computer"
8233,It's okay.
8234,Here is the deal if you want to pay actual money or play the same tanks all the time then you will like it.  If you are working on unlocking all the tanks then you are going to get frustrated.  The soviet tanks are way to powerful.  In the 3000 games I have played I can say I never killed a tank in one shot.  But I can tell you I have been killed by one shot by many soviet tanks.  This is with never seeing the tank that shoots.  If it isnt the soviet tanks then it is the tanks people spent money on.  Some of these tanks are up to $50 for a tank.  I have not joined a group in the game so I dont know how that works.   Then nice thing is the matches are quick and can get many in a short time if you escape after your killed.
8235,"Game is ok as far as content but the mismatching of tiers when creating sides is terrible. I am rarely if ever killed by a equal tier tank. Every kill I experience is by a tank of a higher tier. Where I was experiencing equal tiering  when I first started playing has now turned to consistent deaths after a few weeks of playing and this change took place over night. There is no way my playing ability disappears in one day.  But, over night the team members change to (4) tier 4 and (2) tier 3 tanks and I am consistently be one of the lower tier tanks. If this is the way the the game is run give me the opportunity to drop out of the team prior to battle start or keep the tiers the same between sides. If your player base is that thin then reduce the number of tanks per side to keep the tiers equal.

8237,"Excellent Arcade style game. Couple of matches a day quite enjoyable.

However do bring back gravity force game mode. It was awesome fun.

What are the devs doing for ghost shells? It is really becoming frustating!!!"
8238,really fun allround but in app purchases are frequent
8239,"I played briefly to experience the game for what it is and ignored any form of progression or paid for content.

The kit you start with is enough for a good in-and-out experience for whenever you have a few minutes to spare. I would not play for long sessions, perhaps if I considered grinding rather than having fun. 

Overall, a fun game with a smaller file size and simpler mechanics than direct competitors."
8240,This game is one of the best cross platform and action-packed MMO with PvP tank battles...

8266,"Absolutely love this game to bits. I am aware of the ""Paying to win"" format that this game uses. It does give a pop up offer multiple times per day. It keeps me interested as the developers give the game a major update at least once per month, I rather play the one downloadable on the Microsoft Store as the camera physics and text are more refined. I have put in around 10000+ hours in this game. It is a good way to kill some time if you have nothing else to do. Definitely my favourite online game."
8267,bored? play this.. recommended
8268,Yes
8269,"The game itself is good. Only issues ever I've encountered were minor lag and glitches right after update. And of course, the players can be a bit extra and rude, but overall there are some nice people."
8270,it comes out with new modes
8271,"Fun game with a pretty chill community. It's not overly realistic: less realistic than WoT for PC and, thus, I find it more entertaining.
I just hope they better the graphics since many PCs could manage them (it's nice that it is crossplatform tho)."
8272,Nice game!
8273,nice
8274,"Although the game runs smooth, matchmaking is terrible.

>Several times you'll be matched with higher tier tanks, and you're the only weak one, and you can't do shit cause your bullets won't penetrate their armors.

8285,fun
8286,Been playing since the first year and loved how the game has changed evolved since then. If you're looking for a game to invest your time into this is definitely the one!
8287,"It feels like someone made a bad game in 2000 and filled it with pay to win mechanics, then expected people to play it 2 decades later.

The game looks, sounds, and feels outdated. The audio is underwhelming, as if they just used an old 90's sound library for everything. Battlefield 2 had better graphics and tank physics 15 years ago. Even with graphics turned all the way up, the actual gameplay looks nothing like the screenshots on the store page.

It was nice using WW2 tanks (even if you only start with 1) but the maps feel a little too much like arenas when they could have put more effort in to make it feel immersive (like BF1942 had done). More immersion is lost by the addition of wacky skins, and seeing axis tanks fighting alongside allied tanks. Immersion goes out the window completely when the tanks frequently appear and disappear.

The game tells you ""Use bonuses and win comfortably!"" and has buttons for gold, premium account (which expires), credits, boosters, bonuses, premium shells, containers, xp, tanks, skins, tank slots, which make the game a mess when they're all put together. Why bother with immersion-breaking skins and better shells if they've already monetised it by paying for tanks? Why make the player pay for tanks AND tank slots? A lot of these things aren't even explained.

There's a currency for the tech tree which isn't shown, so you have no idea how much you have unless you try to unlock something, and sometimes the unlock upgrade's stats aren't shown (sometimes the upgrades themselves aren't shown). The game forces you (by greying everything else out) to spend what I assume is a premium currency on shells, but when the text ""purchase as many shells as possible"" comes up and I try to click the ""purchase"" button, even that doesn't work, so you're stuck on a menu with no working buttons at all and have to just ALT+F4.

The tech tree is a ridiculous grind, and the majority of other tanks in the matches were clearly bots, with many of them having generic nicknames with _2015 at the end. They're badly programmed - sometimes doing nothing, messing up the easiest of shots, reacting slowly, or just reacting instantly with a perfect aimbot sniping you across the map. There's so few actual players in it that it makes me wonder - why would I want pay to win mechanics in a singleplayer game?

The circle crosshair can be huge, yet 100% accurate. But sometimes it'll be wildly inaccurate even if you've not been moving, and will zoom itself in and out without you doing anything. There's tank games out there that have better crosshair systems, and they have an interesting mix of tanks and infantry, which was far more fun than WOT. 

You get ""additional credits and XP"" for losing, so where's the motivation to win? So many of the tanks are brainless bots or just players that are blindly aggressive and don't care about the match outcome. The point capture instantly resets if you move slightly out of the zone, and sometimes you'll just get hit by invisible tanks.

They've spammed me with dozens of emails, and they make it difficult to unsubscribe. You'd have to login, and there's 25 boxes you can untick for different ""targeted messages"", and they do the ""we need some time to remove your account from the corresponding newsletter list"" which is nonsense. I still get emails from them in my junk folder. If I got that many emails about every game I played then I'd literally have to sort through over 10,000 emails.

I wouldn't recommend this game to my friends..."
8288,Fast paced game fun to play
8289,Amazing Game.!
8290,"This game is tons of fun, especially with friends! The amount of tanks you can play as is insane, the graphics are stunning, and each map is unique and fun in it's own way! In addition to all of that, it's free!"
8291,Great game and graphics! The gameplay is great and I hope that in the future the new chat feature is improved and more user-friendly
8292,Tanks
8293,T1 Heavy go brrrrrr
8294,YES
8295,Decided to try out this game and I was surprisingly impressed. Aw some game for it's size with decent graphics and detail.
8296,"This game is okay. It has a good variety of tanks (but I would love to see a M1 Abrams come to the game), good map design, and good balance between tanks. I have 2 complains about this game which may or may not turn you away from this game. These 2 complaints are how much credits you earn per match and the platoon size. In the higher tiers of this game, you will lose a lot of money if you lose. If you win the game, you will either earn a little or lose a little. The only way to earn more is either using boosters, not buying things that replenish every game (these things improve your tank), or doing good EVERY SINGLE GAME. So if you go on a losing streak, you will lose a lot of money. (In one of my losing streaks, I lost about 50,000 credits) So if you keep losing money, you may lose your will to keep playing this game. Secondly, I don't like how you can't play with more than 1 friend in a platoon. The max size for a platoon is 2 players so if you're looking for a game to play with more than 1 friend, don't play this game. I just hate how you can't play with your friends or play with people you know are good. World of Tanks Blitz please fix these issues. This last complaint is more of a suggestion. I would like to see a game mode that has respawning so you can get a second chance. So overall, my recommendation on this game really depends. If you're looking to play this with friends, I would not recommend this game. If you're looking for a game to play for a long time, I would recommend this game. Lastly, if you're looking for a game to play just for fun, this game is a gamble. You will either quit on this game or continue playing this. I'm only playing this because I'm almost finished with this game. I will most likely go back to lower tiers because I can never earn money from tiers 7-10."
8297,"this is a nice game to have on low spec PCs ...BUT I suggest you play the REAL WOT PC version which is not in steam store and you have to download wargaming game center (which is available at their official website) for that.

this game is kinda a huge tutorial to the the PC version which also have good performance even in business class laptops and is more realistic than this game. you can play the other version with the same account you play this version.

in summary: highly recommended
and don't forget to install it in your phone.(your progress is shared)"
8298,Over all good games clitches from time to time but some good fun.
8299,Have a bad pc like me and love WoT. Then get this. Trust me :)
8300,Man they should just give it the graphics of the original for PC
8301,Lavonai
8302,I hadnt played world of tanks since i got my pc and saw it on steam so i thought id get back into it. i played a few rounds and it felt off from what i remember. Turns out (didnt read the page at all lol) THEY PUT THE FUCKING MOBILE VERSION ON STEAM. Bruh. Why? Just hit the World of Tanks website grab their launcher and play the un-neutered version. (disregard the play time i have a bad habit of letting games run when i go to sleep or work.)
8303,Its a great game
8304,epic
8305,"I changed my mind. RNG in this game is ridiculous, and that's why I think this game is unplayable for me."
8306,dont play
8307,One of my fav free-to-play games. The graphics are cool and it stays engaging for a long time. Large variety of tanks to choose from. Only downsides would be the graphics and paid content. The prices for special event packs are way too high. I would definetly be interested in buying packs if it weren't LITERALLY $25+ for a tank and some decals.
8308,Much easier than WoT and perfect for noob like me
8309,This game has more grind then a roblox simulator game.
8310,love the game
8311,is an overall good quality game
8312,I love this game.  Just starting out I wish there was a manual for all the extra's in the game besides fighting.

8318,so many bots and so many noobs in this game pls dont download this game
8319,"I first downloaded this on muh phone, say, at the end of 2014, did clanskirms for 2015, and haven't gone back to it since 2018 or something, got to tier 8 for both Ger and USA and ditched the blitz ver for PC, and let's say, they're both very iffy, to say the least."

8349,"Such a great and enjoyable game. You do really have to think how you approach opposite team when facing them In a match. Kinda miss older version since it was great fun.

8350,"Where do i start!!......pay to play mentality, constant updates that slow the game,  playing with 10 yr olds with no sense of the game. Nothing but frustration, over and over......never again. Good bye WOT!"

8383,"This is a fun, addicting game. It has a great balance of strategy and skill as well as a great theme- WWII tanks. The in-game progression is very long. This isn't a game where, after completing some 30 hours of playing time,  you're done with it- after potentially hundreds of hours of purchasing new vehicles, more vehicles are released, and you're trying to climb the ranks.
I, however, find it inferior to the standard World of Tanks client. if you happen to get hooked to this game, and your computer can handle World of Tanks, I'd highly recommend checking it out."
8384,Great game that can be played in a couple of minutes... but addictive enough to play for hours on end.

Comment: Just go for the desktop version, it's a bit heavier because this is designed for even mobile-play. However, a tank on a mobile.. nope"
8386,"I've been playing World of Tanks Blitz for a few years now on my phone, and I find it to be a great game. But playing this game on PC it honestly feels like a new game... The only thing I would recommend is to just turn off (In battle) messages, let me just say if your not at peek performance/playing at 110% every time you play you WILL get **** on. Other than that hope you enjoy it as much as I do! roll out."
8387,excellent game ive ever played................

8389,Fun for 1-2 hours per day
8390,"As long as you love grinding and have a good teammates, this game is for you. Since everything is pretty much grinding after you got into T6 tanks. 

[i]Is it a P2W game?[/i]

Depends on the user I guess. Since even with a good tank you can get killed in the battlefield. So it's all about working together as a team. Having more than one reliable teammates is more than enough for you to win, even with a bad tanks."
8391,tank go boom boom
8392,i did this for a free skin
8393,"So I've decided to give this game a shot and I'm enjoying it so far. I bamboozled my self to get the starter pack which was on sale. If you link some tank action, this is the game:)"

8409,Game balance is poor
8410,cool
8411,fantastic game
8412,very boring game
8413,"Fun.  It's good to be strategic in your approach & shots.  The RNG that controls the damage can be frustrating, but the sweet symphony of the ""Ding!"" when you land a full damage shot or the majesty of a full HP tank exploding because you managed to detonate their ammo rack makes it all worth it.  Since it's mobile, being able to play while I'm on the go is also nice - I get my tanks & stats despite being stuck at my mother-in-law's house and that's a very nice way to pass the time.

I checked that I received this product for free because it's FTP.  I would like additional compensation to play this game."
8414,"Прикольная игра, ибо у меня топ акк)))
"
8415,"+ Small footprint, minimal nagging and life intrusion overheads. VERY EASY to play, perfect to game to play with friends particularly it's 'platoon' which is encouraged. Regular updates to the graphics, modernisation of the graphics as time goes by. Extremely undemanding on resources. Barely 8% of a modern PC or tablet will ever been in use during full load. Minimal advantage in buying shop items. 

- the ease of play means there are many inexperienced players still learning the basics, particularly at weekends games can become very hard to win due to randomness of the team mates."

8427,its fun
8428,just bad.
8429,"If you are looking for casual play, I guess you could say this game is alright. However, if you want to progress and try to reach the higher tiers, and your not willing to drop 60 -> 80 USD to buy a premium tank, you are wasting your time. The game was a good concept, but the team behind it lies and doesn't hold promises. Nowadays, a new player can pull out mommy's credit card and buy themselves a tier X tank on the spot. We were promised that a player could not buy a tank over tier 8 in the start."
8430,Lmao shooting from point blank range yet missing because of that hit marker. Really? Would moving your tank 2km/h just make the vehicle become an AA and shoot every shell in the sky? Because it looks like that marker really loves messing around with my aim. I'll just stick to grinding War Thunder.
8431,ok
8432,is a very good game
8433,Love it!
8434,"This game is excellent for those people who likes quick games, each match is approximately four to five minutes... probably won't take your time like other games where each match could last until the night."
8435,"Really fun. But, the matchmaking needs a little bit of work... I got a MM that was so unbalanced, It was really annoying. But still a fun game to play. Keep an eye out of sore try-hard losers in a match, whether its normal, ranked or even in event game modes :)"
8436,"its a good game
"
8437,i rlly like the game because it is massivly multiplayer and fun!! FYI dont fall into the trap of buying premium tanks!!!!!!!!!

8443,"If you like tanks, then this is the game for you."

8455,"_D
"
8456,"World of Tanks Blitz isn't a deep game but it's quick game (2 or 3 minutes) and there is a lot of skill and progression within it without paying money. It's tier based so you start with a crappy tank and then earn skill points and silver to buy better tanks. This has the potential to be grindy but it's not too bad and you can derive a lot of fun from choosing which tanks to play as they all have attributes in their favour.

Be warned there is a pay to play element and some players do spend on premium ammo and tanks but I don't find myself overly disadvantaged because there is a skill element - buying a premium tier X tank and loading it up with premium ammo won't do you any good against experienced players."
8457,"great game

8458,i cant lauch the game plss helpp meeee
8459,"World of Tanks Micro ... maps could stand to be a touch bigger but otherwise, it's a lot of fun in a pinch."
8460,"After Years of playing WOT, I found Blitz..I have to admit that at first I wasn't sold but once you find a good clan or some friends to play with and team up with it adds a different element to it. I really enjoy the smaller teams as well as the faster paced rounds. All the tanks you know from WOT and 5 times the fun. Also unlike WOT you can get free premium time just by playing and opening chest, couple that with the boosters and this game stands out above the rest if you are looking for a game to keep you intrigued than this is it."

8466,"The game cheating is almost boastful.  My friends that have sunk a lot of money don't have all the technical issues that I have, and I have only spent a couple hundred dollars on this game.  It has so much potential but requires constant payment to function properly."
8467,This game is an utter piece of junk
8468,"A fun game with surprising depth. The level of commitment depends on you. WoTBlitz is great for a quick matchup (unrated battles are 6 min long). While it is not as graphically intense as its predecessor, it allows other platforms to play other than PC. The tradeoff is worth it.  A word on the cash shop. The game tries very hard to sell you tanks and gold and premium membership. Without the premium membership you are going to have to grind a bit to get the higher tanks. The game does give little windows of Premium as rewards and gold. As long as you go in with your eyes open on that, its a wonderful game."
8469,"This is a garbo mobile game, go download the actual game from their website."

Game experience now- Shitty!! the devs have become greedy assholes. the matchmaking is a crock of sht. the nightmare has become the reality. pay to win in a toxic community. players steal clear and certain kills for their enjoyment. team play absolutely is diminishing. players are quick to talk shit and use the infamous word like its equal to the abundance of water in the ocean! They are also so quick to offer up trash talk and name calling, i seem to run across the word, KIKE, being thrown around a lot! devs basically put the matchmaking on auto pilot and dont really seem to give a fk what anyone says in their hatemail rants or to the cordial players it has left... my overall opinion is WG/Devs will always be on their knees ready for that fat cock of Warthunder. Its a poor comparison because the two are on separate playing fields. Warthunder has machine guns on each and every tank, plus you get airplanes, ships and helicopters. Blitz you get unrealistic tanks thats it... Wake the fk up WG you dumb motherfkrs!!!! your shit will always suck hind tit as long as Warthunder is around!! i was actually wishing hard that aftrer your abrupt washington office total shut down that they had finally done it and put your sorry asses out of the misery!!!

WG still into sucking dick like $5 whores needing to get their next fix... fuck you devs i hope corona erases your fucking bloodlines right off the fucking planet.. if i could watch your death by firing squad it be like a trip to motherfucking Disney Land!! all laughter and cheers and middle fingers up to your shilock faces as you waller in your own shit.. scum pieces of fucking garbage. FUCK YOUR LIVES!!"
8498,"Before I start, I wish to apologize if I make any grammatical errors, English is not my first language.

In short, this game is a nice fun game to play if you are interested in WW2 and later era tanks or this type of gameplay.

Now, for the long version.

The game is a 7v7 pvp game,  and there are two gamemodes. The first is encounter where the objective is to either eliminate the entire opposing team or capture the base. The second is supremacy, it is similar to the first gamemode, however there are multiple bases to capture, and capturing one or all, wont automatically make you win, instead your team will get points per base captured, destroying an enemy tank will reward you with points and remove points from the enemy. Eliminating the entire enemy team is also an option. All of this will take time at maximum of seven minutes per game, however it is quite rare that a match would last this long.

The goal of the game is to grind tanks lines. There are currently eight nations to chose from; The United Kingdom, America, USSR, China, Pan-European (Multiple European nations in one which will lead to an Italian tank, but more tanks from the previous nations would be added here.), Japan, Germany and France. All of these nations have their own playstyle, so make sure you start with the right nation for you. When you do select a nation, you will be given a tier one tank, your goal is to move up the tiers to get that sweet shiny tier ten. But, to go up the tiers, you need experience to upgrade the tank, then get more experience to get the  next tank. How do you get experience? By simply playing the game. Even if you lose you will still get some, bur far less than if you win.

The action, is very intense. You only have a certain amount of hitpoints, and once you lost some, you can not get them back, and dying means game over for you, and back to the garage. What makes the action intense is that skill is at play (And luck too). There are tactics to be used, like hull-down and sidescraping to throw off your enemy and make their shells bounce of your armor. These thing you will learn in due time, it is not as hard as people make it out to be, all you need is the right tank, and time.

There is a tank for everyone;
Light tanks: Fast, nimble, deadly and no armor, their job is to spot the enemy, flank and help out their teammates who are in a sticky situation thanks to their speed. However, they have no armor, and one HE shell, (a shell that has a hard time penetrating but when it does it deals much more damage than normal ammo) and a huge chunk of your health is gone. So play smart, and be effective.
Medium tanks: Jack of all trades, one of the hardest tanks to master since you need knowledge on everything. There are mediums tanks with less armor, weaker guns and better speed, or vise-versa. 
Heavy tanks: Big, heavy and slow. As the name suggest, these are the heavies of fpss. Their job is to soak up the damage with their large hitpoints and return the love with their big guns. However, they are quite slow, so they easily fall victim to circle of deaths, so make sure you are never alone.
Lastly, tank destroyers (TD for short): Usually turretless, but have great guns. Turretless TDs have very restricted movement so they are best at the back of the team since they are very easy to get behind and delete them, however they make up for it for their great gun which can pack a lovely punch. There are currently 2 lines which have a turret, and one differs from lightly armored to heavily armored. 

The game also holds events, which if you follow the instructions, you will get rewards, and sometimes if you are lucky, even a premium tank.

The graphics of the game are only getting better, and keep in mind this is originally a mobile phone game, so the graphics can not be all that great, but with some updates, they are trying to make the game look nicer. This is a plus for me, since the game actually looks nice, and if you have any device, you can guarantee that you will run it.

Since I got into the game because of my interest in WW2 tanks, I can safely say that most tanks are historically correct. Currently from the hundreds of tanks, which are not fictional, I only found one tank that is not historical. But, even so, it is a huge joy to take command of a Tiger 1 or the infamous Maus.

But, there is not a game which is perfect.
The game sells premium tanks for real money, which are quite powerful, and some are OP. The company also sells loot boxes for a chance to get the reward, which people labeled the game as ""Pay 2 win"". Look at the price of the game, yeah, it is a free game, so how would they make money if they did not make appealing offers? Some tanks are powerful, but there is not a tank that does not have a weakness. And besides, all the tanks which you can get for free, are powerful and fun in their own respective way. You can play the game without spending a dime, but at the cost of taking a while to move up the tiers.

Overall, I think this game is a great game and fun at that. The community takes the game too seriously which does make it less enjoyable, but simply turning off the chat helps. If you are interested in tanks and have a low end device, install the game, it is small so it does not use up a lot of space. If you are not interested in tanks but what I mentioned here sound appealing, do not be afraid to give it a try, like I had said, it is free, so you would be losing nothing. 

I hope you had found this review helpful, this is my first time, so I apologize if I had done any mistakes."
8499,garbage game with garbage toxic community
8500,Pay to win. Unfair matchmaking if you don't pay.
8501,nais gheim
8502,"Way to many overpowered premium crate tanks. if you dont want a wallet balance, get this game"
8503,first of all there is no player level system to decide matchmaking. matchmaking is random exprienced player constantly gets matched with noobs and gets destroyed. now it is pay to win. just buy a premium tank or a tonne of gold use that to buy silver and get a tier 10 tank. thats why noobs are there in this game.
8504,GASERU
8505,Very fun
8506,"This game is an endless cycle of pain and suffering that is rarely interrupted by a brief moment of happiness after an accidental victory. The fictional vehicles look like they were made by a child who snorted cocaine for dinner. I despise this game and the company behind it, because they don't care about anything but the money made by me hurling my chair at my monitor before buying a new one and surrendering to their P2W ways, and buying a few premium tanks myself.

All in all, a great game. Would definitely recommend."
8507,"This game's pretty damn awesome. Maybe it's not exactly like the standard PC version, but hey, I think some things might even be better in Blitz. Definitely thumbs up for me, go try it out!"
8508,Fun!
8509,too many bugs

8515,"this game is a steaming pile of elephant dung, theres a reason most of us pro players quit this broken game dont waste your life playing it like i did, the devs have 0 idea of what balance is, theres 0 reason to get good at the game theres no real money to be had from competitions theres not even any sense of accomplishment to be had from winning competitions. dont waste your time 0/10"
8516,"1/10 op tanks tooning nonstop devs dont know how to fix the problems so they just release more op tanks to ""balance"""
8517,"This is a very fun game, especially since I do not have the best computer."
8518,"I spent so many hours on this game and really enjoyed playing it daily. Eventually however I moved on to other games due to the excessive grind. Nevertheless, its still a fun game that I can jump back right into."
8519,Wtf is wrong with the matching a 7th tier tiger P with full upgraded modules don't even leave a dent on the 8th tier heavys unplayable I feel like I am throwing rocks instead of AP
8520,"I love the variety of tanks, and the duration of battles is just right."
8521,"PC WoT but the minimum amount of fun that was there for high-skilled players has been completely stripped out.
Don't even bother trying it out."

8525,Because it is free and it can run on terrible laptops!
8526,I hAVE FUN THIS GAME
8527,Good
8528,"It's just world of tanks.... And I love World of Tanks. For those who may not know. It's an online game that involves tanks, luck, and strategy. Its super fun and frustrating and I highly recommend it for anyone who is willing to play more competitively.

If you have seen anyone discussing the money aspect of this game, ignore it. It is completely free to play and very possible to get all the way to tier X without paying a penny out of pocket. 

The community can be toxic, but easy to ignore. Also, it is RNG and grinding, but that is what makes it worth playing to me. 

Basically, try this game if you:
-Enjoy grinding (but not the boring type in some RPG games)
-Enjoy tanks
-Enjoy the main WoT
-Enjoy quick and easy battles
-Are okay with a little RNG and luck

Do NOT try this game if you:
-Are prone to rage easily 
-Want super rapid progression
-Play super casual (nothing wrong with that, but this is more competitive)

Also, try regular World of Tanks PC! It's more advanced and more competitive. I am happy to platoon with you, my game name is Paoyvzlkat!"
8529,nice
8530,fun action shooter to test your skill with  other tank drivers.
8531,I love having this baby on my itouch
8532,"very good in mechanics, although i do wish the graphic  to be adjusted a little bit more"
8533,realistic mechanics.. but still have the fun of gaming experience instead of realisticism
8534,"WoT BLITZ is a scaled down version of the original game with a focus on game mechanics. WoT BLITZ is 'WoT LIGHT'. Still, it's a fun game... if not for the lemmings you'll be forced to play with... and THAT is the one feature that is shared between both versions."
8535,"fun, fast re-play rate, but may be a little 1D after a while.  Time will tell"
8536,игра просто топ
8537,LOVE THE TANKS!
8538,"world of tanks blitz 'was' an amazing game-the different tanks,the playstyle of them all and the different modes that came out occasionally. Yes i would defininatly recommend the game to user because its great but there are problems that i do come across.

 1, the matchmaking is very,very random. now this may mean u get an amazing player to carry u to a win but this rarely happens. alot of the times they are on hte enemy team and u get destroyed, but there is always a dummy in 80% of the games i play in. its not to say that they r bad, its to say that they buy these 'op' premium tanks like the is-6 or a t26e4 or just a t8 premium. before players had many options to choose from, for example, there where usually 3-4 types of t1 tank that led to different tank lines but after the 5.5 update it got easier to grind to t10. on average, in 1 whole day of grinding f2p, u can get to t6-7 in just ONE DAY. so the people who are new dont learn how to play the game and its as almost they r speed-running the game.  

2, the matchmaking is a bit weird; what ever type of tank u are playing, wargaming puts u in a match with a tank of 'equal' power. especially ratings it is a pain to put up with.ratings are 'apparently' meant to match u up with player of the same rating (i.e if i had 2800 rating, i'd be put in a a 2900 game for the 7 players mean rating put together), and this dosent mean u are matched with the best player, majority of the time its matched to their winrate (its a hypothosis) which is usually around 40-50%. its a good game to be honest but wargaming, please change up the matchmaking system and do it around winrate, not the quality of tanks."
8539,GOOD
8540,it has the maus
8541,Good game if your pc cant run normal world of tanks but still recommend it
8542,CS AHOJ
8543,Noice
8544,just like it. large variety of tanks and good quality
8545,"A great action packed games who love tanks. Receives tons of monthly updates. Lots of Tanks which are upgradable and competitiveness is on fire.You never wanna quit when you are started.
A f2p games having such features is a must try."
8546,Good game after all
8547,"As with all the ""world of"" games, it's built to give you looong grinds and extract your money. Still, the gameplay is addictive and the sheer number of tanks, equipment, etc gives progress junkies tons of stuff to strive for. Just prepare for some frustration if you're not willing to cough up a bit of dough."
8548,Best
8549,Great game
8550,"It's alright. Basically World of Tanks Lite. It's not  p2w as some people would suggest. (And yes I know what I'm talking about, 67% win rate 12k battles played) All tanks have strengths and weaknesses, its just the premium tanks' strengths seem to be a bit more noticeable. For a better experience, git gud and play in a platoon."
8551,"yes
"
8552,"It's an eh game. Takes a while to progress past level 7 for the first couple times, after so you'll get much better. For it's graphics, it isn't so good. After all, it IS a mobile game as well. Anyways, have a wonderful day, play game if you'd like. The community also loves trash talking."
8553,edrsgf
8554,good game to switch off to
8555,"As for the game, in short, whoever is familiar with large tanks and who is tired of art and standing in the bushes, the game will definitely go, there’s a great 7x7 format, no art and really a vigorous tank chopper, on average battles take 3-5 minutes, tanks swing much faster (because of this the dominance of crazy cretins at 10 levels) and you just don’t have time to miss, you always need to think ahead, keep everything in mind and control the situation on the map."
8556,yes
8557,no
8558,
8559,"Really fun, I mean fun. You should try this game. I really enjoy it and you should to."
8560,Best game EVER! Definitely worth it to play it!
8561,shit game with bullshit rng. Can't even connect to the damn servers
8562,pretty cool
8563,ITS AMAZING
8564,I came back to the game after several months because I now have a desktop and not a cruddy laptop. AND all my tanks are gone. All 200 hours worth of work lost. I had about 12 high tier tanks and now I have base random tanks.
8565,"WOTB is my favorite ""play everday"" free video games since I am a mostly a FPG. My other fav's is HEARTHSTONE. Both provide hours of entertainment, learning, and strategy.  Did I say these were ""free"", AWESOME!!"
8566,"yay i luv  it

8571,"good value pack, decent tank for beginners"
8572,Very nicu
8573,tank goo boom LOL
8574,Great game
8575,"Random toxic, random and unbalanced game ever. No skill required, just how lucky you are, the shell from the most inaccurate guns can hit you from the other end of the map but when you play on something accurate you won't hit the nearest enemies, and even if you do hit it you still somehow manage to not penetrate a light tank or get the lowest possible damage, because it is so random."
8576,"Tonnes of fun for a free-to-play game! Slow movement and lengthy reloads will force you to better strategise your attacks and every battle is guaranteed to be just as exciting as the last. Matchmaking takes a short amount of time so you'll be jumping into action almost instantly. Each tank has its own set of stats and over time you will familiarise yourself with their strengths and weaknesses.

There are plenty of money walls preventing you from advancing quickly but thankfully the ranking system eliminates the risk of encountering pay-to-win players. You’ll find that higher level tanks become more “specialised” (i.e. reduced armour rating in exchange for stronger firepower) so I encourage you research which one is best for your preferred playstyle before investing.

EDIT: And it only chews up two gigs! Haha"
8577,I love this Game it is a little bit better than the other world of tanks In my opinion I would recomend this game to people who love fast tank shooters with fast battles and always ROLL OUT!
8578,"it si vevy fun
"
8579,It is a fun game if you have less than like 4 hours a day to play a game and is easier opposing World of Tanks which is harder and takes more time. Really fun and can be mobile.
8580,"f u c k i n love it
"
8581,very good game
8582,"This version of World of Tanks is more fun than the full version in my opinion. Less gold spam ammo and better balance with tank armor give them more personality and less power creep. Some tech lines are missing, but it also may be a plus to be honest."
8583,Great game to play with friends !!!
8584,gud gejm
8585,pretty neat game
8586,"a huge grind to get up in the tiers, especially if you get the wrong tank for your playstyle, but an overall enjoyable experience."
8587,I like play this game lot it's fun to play. It's my favorite tank game.
8588,fast fun and free in the wind ;)
8589,yes
8590,idk it's good i guess

8596,War thunder is better
8597,World of Tanks Blitz us a fun interactive game where you get to participate in matches against and with other players. The graphics are great and the tanks are very life like.
8598,I like the way I can dip in and out without having to commit many hours at a time to the one game. I also enjoy the fact that the matching process avoids easy wins. I like the competitive side of the play.
8599,"I keep freezing whenever I get into fights, especially when I'm aiming and it messes my whole game up."

8601,Bad player base with bad match making do not play
8602,nice game
8603,"it is a fun game 
only thing is you cannot play it on the go 
"
8604,like it very much
8605,"Its a good game graphically and the physics are very good but lets be honest with  the money being made on this it could be even better than it is.

I would not recommend buying the in game boxes as you do not get much out of them bear in mind the drop rate on most is 5% or less so you pump money in and get nothing out.

Just to update although I have spent many hours on this game I do feel that the game is moving more to Pay to play as there are more and more gold tanks

JUST TO UPDATE after seeing that this game has gone even more Pay to play there is  a new offer at the moment which will allow you to buy a new tank for £79.99 which is ridiculous I cannot hand on heart say this game is good it suffers from a very toxic user base these days and something needs to be done but don't hold your breath."
8606,Well if u were feeling like u are a noob no matter how hard u work well this is the game for you.
8607,"Been playing this game on Mobile (iPad) since it game out, there are many tanks and great opportunities to really boost yourself up there and get on the top of the game. Highly Recommend for children liking to work with vehicles and there are very interactive and supporting people in this game. :thumbsup:"
8608,донатная параша-свалка
8609,"Exceptionally slow match making. Extremely slow game play. Slow is the underlying message.  Ballanced? Nah. Not so much.  Cheating and pay to win? Yep. You betcha. 
Light tanks can kill tank destroyers with a single shot from across the map at tier 8? Nah. Cool story bruh. 
Lots of people either don't know how to play or just refuse to be helpful.  In game communication sucks. I don't know... it used to be fun but recently I think they made changes. Controls have gotten less responsive somehow.  I've had 1000 gold disappear. I can't access my account. I cant change my password. They dont answer email. They might see a demand for a full refund of every red cent ive spent unless they quickly resolve my account issues. Call me wargaming we've got stuff to discuss.
Limited maps on an endless repeat cycle. Spammers and boosting. Lots and lots of cheating. My blocked list is huge. If you are considering this game please don't.  It's got far too many problems and the developers refuse to fix them.  Give them money and be quiet. I I guess we should be thankful the greedy SOBs haven't put ads in the game. Shouldn't have mentioned it.  Now it'll happen. Ya'll is broken over there at WOT and ya ought to get right. 
If i could give you 1/4 star that may be to generous."

8613,"the game is absolute trash and no one should download it,it gets boring after a few hours and u want to end you pathetic life.Help me im trapped in someones house and the only thing i can do i can do i play this shit game but now i wanna die"
8614,"Slow and difficult to progress without a Premium account, so its about buying your advancements from level 6/7.
And you can end up on a team of Noobs and get hammered  by 'Credits loss' even if you survive a battle or are the best player in that team. Its about money making, but can be fun if you play it your own way."
8615,goww
8616,Good.
8617,"It's a mobile game, don't expect actual WOT but it's still fun and P2W."
8618,Game is strictly pay to win. I played nearly 200 games and was rarely placed on a winning team. leveling up is made near impossible to encourage you to buy tanks. Avoid this game unless you have deep pockets.
8619,its shit

8621,good game
8622, loadtime 40 min for play 5 min WTF
8623,"Wot Blitz is a game that simulates war with tanks from different unions and countries like the USSR,Germany,United Kingdom etc. WoT has this PayToWin element that it bothers you sometimes when a player has a more powerful tank or modules than you but is very fun to play (for some days then you leave it because PayToWin) Something I have to say I discovered a gane mode (well I created) one persons uses the mouse and the other the keyboard is fun but it won’t help you win matches"

Game is incredible, but managed poorly. Short quick abrupt battles and you have to fight 8 outta 10 battles lower tier. I don't know how they claim over 350 million players then screw you by making you play up tier'd matches. Game play is manipulated, tier matches are purposefully designed to manipulate and control winners and losers. If they would stop all the Euro-Trash socialistic behavior of the game it would be awesome. I played this game for ten minutes and was convinced it was not American because of the game behavior. OP tanks are way over priced, never buying another one unless I know its great. I have bought 8 tanks and they were all a ripoff."

8669,"I know I haven't played much but it's way too arcade for me, the tanks are unrealistic and have health bars, and are in no way historically accurate. 

A game such as War Thunder would be much better because it is more historically accurate, has different gamemodes if you want a arcade or realistic experience and it's not just tanks its got aviation and naval too.

So I would recommend WoT if you just want a quick arcade game but if you are more serious definately go for WT"
8670,this game is nice.
8671,"you can get to tier 10 in about 2k games much faster then the original.
7min rounds > 15min rounds"
8672," WOT Blitz is an aging p2w style game, the monetization comes from punishing new players with a multitude of handicaps, including real money ammo that penetrates pretty much anything (each shot costs a couple cents) buying a new tank, its always going to be beaten by everyone else in that tier, because you havent got all the upgrades, crew, consumables etc. these can all be bought for huge sums of real world money, i'd bought two of the ""special limited time deals"" and at the time of writing and still have 12 days of premium left, which i am abandoning. the game is a giant grind that gets worse and worse the longer you play, as most players naturally leave before hitting tier 5-6, all thats left after that are really angry and toxic players who are stuck losing every game. skill plays less of a role in higher tiers, as it becomes a game of who has more disposable income, and hours a day to spend grinding. Doesnt matter if you have godlike aim or positioning, if the other team spends more money, or has invested 10-100's of more hours in a single tank, they tip the balance away from a 50% chance of winning a game.

i tried to remain positive during my near 100 hours of playtime, which to be honest the first 3 tiers were very fun and fair, what came after was worse than a mixed bag, it was downright horrible, to the point i felt like i was getting put in a losing team more often because i had stopped spending money on microtransactions (maybe thats a bit far fetched but its honestly what i've felt is happening, and my stats and purchase history kinda relate closely to each other statistically.

the servers arnt very good overall, on asia atleast, the ping for me is about 200 and about every 3rd game i get packet loss that often results in getting blown up because the server keeps driving you forward when this happens. theres over 10+ languages used on asia servers so communication is almost pointless

the ""special time limited deals"" are deceiving, simply because the ingame stores permanent sales are very bad value for money, and theres lots of place to spend gold coins poorly

i'd avoid this game, in the short term its fun, but the long term seems like a punishment rather than a form of entertainment. after deleting it from my harddrive i felt a weight of stress off my shoulders, like now i dont have to worry about maintaining a good stat sheet, or getting up early and staying up late to get x2 bonuses that get wasted anyway because 3 people went afk and you get 4v7'd and suffer the penalty, like its your fault other people made it impossible to win.

i'm done with game that impose a punishment system for new players, on the basis of not spending $100's just to be on equal playing fields in terms of equipment."
8673,sometimes more fun than big WoT brother
8674,great
8675,"i dont recommend this game because if you lose all of your tanks by accident you cant get them back and even if you uninstall the game and install it again it will go back to your account with no tanks at all so somebody please fix my problem with my tanks i have none and i want the starting japan tank somebody please help
"
8676,it is a good game has its ups an downs like all games.
8677,"Although I will keep playing for the time being I can already tell that this is a pay to win game.  Only at tier 5 tanks and struggling to do damage without using premium rounds.  This often means I am unable to do damage no mater how many shots I land.  These premium rounds can be purchased with real world money or in game money.  However, in game money is used to repair your tank and being destroyed too early in a match means you will not earn even enough to cover costs.  This creates an environment where players want to hang back, not take too many risks, and die last for personal reward rather than a team mentality.

Again, I'm still going to play for a while.  However, I know I am dooming myself to hours, if not days, of frustration trying to scrape by and probably dropping to tier 3 tanks to earn in game funds to play higher tiers.  Of course, I am dreading tiers 6-10 as tier 5 is already a struggle financially."
8678,"best game but too hard to research other tanks, otherwise, I love it!"
8679,THIS IS THE BEST GAME!
8680,"Not a bad game, you can freely spent your time playing WoTB."
8681,"Хорошая игра, затягивает. Играю довольно часто, но есть несколько но.
1) До сих пор не исправили пролеты сквозь танк и это очень раздражает, когда остаешься 1 в 3 и более
2) Постоянные проблемы с пингом. Врядли интернет 500 мб/с не тянет данную игру. При учете, что я живу 1 и интернет никем более не расходуется пинг 100+ это слишком много. Еще и лоссы постоянные
3) Баги на различных картах. Вот едешь, едешь и цепляешься за угол какого-нибудь здания и взлетает. 0 урона, поражение, -% побед. Ладно еще в тк можно повеселиться, но в рандоме...

Если оценивать данную игру по 10-бальной шкале, то я поставлю 6/10"
8682,"Great graphics of the various maps , from the desert to exotic to mountainous. Opportunity to learn how tanks have developed throughout history up to present day, along with some tanks where artistic license has been stretched a bit."

8699,"Too much pay to win with newly released premium tanks and the teams are nothing short of incompetent!  Watch your stats tank due to the countless hordes of dummies that the matchmaker assigns to you if you're competent.  Once you cross over 1000 battles the honeymoon is over, and the real pain begins.  No matter how hard you try, the matchmaker and RNG will bone hard you making games unwinnable.

8700,it is a great game!!!
8701,Did not allow me to recover my old account.
8702,"Alright. I've played this game for like 2 months now and i think i am ready to give a review.

Pro:
It doesnt take up much space, doesnt take much time to play a match and you can get up to high tiers really easily. It's not a game like War Thunder where you have to aim at specific areas to kill an enemy unit. 
I like the game for being so simple and easy to play. However.

Con:
It's a shit game. It really is. The reason why is because The game doesn't depend much about how you play. It depends what tier you got and how your team plays. If youre a low tier playing against tiers that are higher than you, thats gonna be hard. If you play with a noob team that cant do shit, good luck. I've had many matches. And in most of them, i lost due to my team being retarded as fuck. And i get those teams maybe 3 or 4 times in a row. Even at tier 8, you get shitty teams. Also, due to covid, This shitty game lags a lot.

Facit:
If you're a WoT fan but dont like the long games and long Tank tree researches, this game might be something for you.

If you're a guy that rages easily over the shit your teammates do, this might not be for you.
"
8703,great game for those who love tank games or team based games..
8704,"It's an awesome combat MMO strategy game, you have to coordinate with your teammates so you can achieve victory in battle"
8705,ахуенная игра
8706,"Very cool battles with a diverse range of tanks. Games between Tier I-V are simple with little strategy involved. Just learn the ropes and improve them. Tier VI-X you need a little more practice and the community on Steam/Reddit is happy to give you strategy tips as I was given when the battles became a little harder. Over all it's really cool and also not very demanding on your PC as I run this fine on a laptop with an I3 processor, while my other steam games all flop on even the lowest settings. 10/10 would reccomend, not much grinding, progress over time."
8707,Better than WoT
8708,"I like playing games like this one and the gameplay is fun.
The detail in this game is good just like the real tanks."
8709,i would recommend playing this game because it has a pretty cool aspect to it of managing different types of tanks sort of teaching the gamer a few things about world war 2 tank wise. Overall the game is pretty good keeping the player on edge to unlock the next tier of tank. I liked how there are tanks from multiple different wars as well as fantasy tanks which adds to the cool aspect.
8710,haha ATGM goes brrrrrr
8711,"Very fun to play with friends, but the grind is hard as heck. Make sure to never switch lines or else its gonna take even longer to get to the goodies."

They should be sued by the entirety of the gaming community for even called this ai packed game an mmo."
8737,Fun game that requires tactical acumen.
8738,not bad
8739,"3 Stars, optimization was pretty decent considering my 2005 laptop can run it decently at 30 fps low settings. I have a complaint about gameplay, but only in the fact that half to players struggle to earn enough XP. Thats about it. Would recommend to casual tank lovers, if you're more serious, I would recommend War Thunder instead."
8740,"The game is a piece of art but don't be fooled by the ""download for free"" icon since the game is free but it uses in game purchases to scam money from you and people have spent quite the pretty penny on this game but other than that the game is quite good it isn't 100% accurate far from it and it can be addicting but the game's community is one of the most toxic i have ever seen. (i have played this game for over than 1000 hours in this game and its really good other than the things above will lead you to believe and the entire community isn't toxic. whoever seen this review and read it all have a nice day)"

8746,"Overall, this game is kinda time-killing, light and actually good for newcomers to experience before going to the main games.
The game is basically ""World Of Tanks in a nutshell"" with less tanks and smaller maps, you might enjoy it more as the gameplay itself is faster and easier to action: kill or be killed. Of course, you will need to work with your teamates to achieve the goals, depends on each map's ""gamemodes"". Also, tanks are easier to be unlocked now.

Though there is one biggest downpoint that I personally not enjoy. GOLD TANKS.

Anyhow, you should try this game once and see for yourself.

8750,"Great idea of a game, very not-fun in implementation. Seemingly designed to frustrate you into buying tanks and boosters. Matchmaking leaves much to be desired. I still play it when I have a lot of patience. Couldn't recommend it because it's more aggravating than enjoyable."
8751,best free  game
8752,it fun
8753,"When i 1st started playing the game, it was very enjoyable, now the match making is so broken, its just not a fun game to play anymore. Its not even close call games, its either total win or total defeat, and its pretty much total defeat 90% of the time. it doesn't matter how well you play, if you are facing 2-4 tanks after your team dies within the 1st 2 minuets of a 7 minuet game, you find yourself swamped by the enemy team. 
you do average damge per game of 2.5k to 4k damage, and still loose the match its not even fun to just do as much damage as you can anymore."

Gameplay is engaging, entertaining and high quality.  Recommend strongly."

8764,"Extremely pay2win game. Basically if you don't play 24/7 you have no chance against noobs with mom's credit card. It was fun back in the day, when noone took it seriously (even Wargaming), but now it's just their money mule... The prices are ridiculous considering what you get in exchange. Almost with every update they add new vehicles with ridiculous pricing and extremely unbalanced stats. Some kiddos who just installed the game buy them and destroy your hardly owned tank in seconds. In this game you can literally buy time, because you can pay like a 100 bucks instead of playing for like 2 months. And what's worse, many players comply and actually buy the premium vehicles or special packages.... I'M DISGUSTED"
8765,"""This game reflects the World of Tanks, that I've seen 8 years ago, because of fast paced gameplay and simplicity"" is what my father says. However I doubt, that World of Tanks 8 years ago was a massive customer milking spree."
8766,Good game
8767,"I love the old memoriabilia and I have been playing since the beginning, sadly there isn't as big of a player base as before but please join the fight!"
8768,"The matches are very fast usually over in less than 2 minutes. You can get stuck with a team that does 0 damage even when you play ratings (its meant to put you in matches with players of equal skill) I am a 53% winrate player with 10K battles at the time of this review and i have played in ratings matches where the next highest winrate player on my team only has a 43% winrate and only 1,500 battles. To put it short you'll love this game if you like to carry teams and you hate team play. You can play completely for free and if you get good events give you a chance to win free premium  tanks, free exp, boosters and loads of credits. You will have to at least get and hold a 52% winrate and win about 20 to 30 or more matches a day in some of the events for the better tanks if you want them completely free. Tier 1 and tier 10 (the highest tier) are full of the same low skill level players, so going up in tier doesn't improve your match quality or duration. Many players have 60k, 70k, even 80k battles and only have a 48% winrate. The only way to play decent matches with other skilled players is to play tournaments, but that requires you to organize a team."
8769,"This game is pretty good. But RNG in the game sometimes really not on your side. And sometimes you need to spend some money for better tanks. But the game is pretty enjoyable, need teamwork on the battlefield and little bit of luck when you shots."

If you really are interested in this game then I assume you will be dissapointed once you get to one of 10 tier vehicles and will question yourself why you spent a whole month on this.

The game is a skill based game, I recommend watching videos to learn how to play because you'll probably suck. Tournaments are fun to get involved in, and provide a completely different side of the game. You can join established communities of people that are usually pretty friendly and are mostly willing to help you get even better, though is very time consuming."

8796,"Game was good in like 2015 but then they slowly fucked it with microtransactions and removed the best tank, the luchs. ALSO this is just a shitty port of the mobile port of a pc game. I can't believe I spent like $50 for a shitty premium tank one time."

Oh you havent bought any premium tanks well you gonna die because everyone with premium will penetrate you
Trash game sidescraping doesnt even help you anymore not any angles because if there is a premium tank he will find a way to penetrate.

Well, now my winning rate is getting close to 65%, and my highest tier X average damage is 3300 now, But I think the game can't bring me as much happiness as once ago. My in game name is Player_31415926535. Asia server."
8811,"Similar to the original WoT but with smaller maps, few tanks per team, and no artillery. The game is cross platform with a phone and tablet which some players on your team and the other team maybe on. You can link your steam account to your WoT Blitz account and take your progress with you on your phone. There is no link between the original WoT and Blitz so you won't have access to already acquired tanks and progress. Downside: Loot Crates"

You win some. you lose some. either way it's still a fun game! Grindy.. But still fun! Play with one of your buddy's in a platoon and go and reign victory! They have all the factions and overall gameplay? Oh it's addicting. very addicting.
Can't get enough of this game! Always new players to defeat and oppose!"
8818,"This is a very important game for me, so buckle up for a long review. 

Writing a review for this game is a very double-edged sword. If you'd asked me to recommend World Of Tanks Blitz to someone in 2014, 2015, or hell, even 2016, I would've done so without hesitation. Back in its hayday this game was probably the single best MMO on mobile devices, and as a PC game was among the likes of Team Fortress 2. That is, in that it was a very competitive online game that had very minimalist requirements on the graphics card. from '14-16 this was my absolute go-to game, and I don't say that lightly. 

As someone who in the game's prime was averaging an 80% winrate and 2400 average damage, I feel I am qualified to talk about the decline of Blitz. 

In the game's prime, the community was relatively small, there were a LOT of very active community members, who were polite when conversing and were very active on the game's forum. The gameplay was simple, elegant, and completely engrossing. Most of all, the developers had a lot of freedom from the parent company, and were doing a lot of unique things with a spinoff title. The PR staff were the highlight of the company. Guys like RatBat and 'Sly were as much community members as they were employees, and all sorts of fun was had interacting with them.

Over the last four years, however, the game has evolved into such a state that I cannot recommend it to anyone. Over the years, Wargaming (the parent company) made some of the worst business practices imaginable, right out of the EA handbook: 

All staff except for the ones in Belarus were laid off, completely alienating all but the Russian servers of the game. The Russian community moderators were incredibly strict about game rules, and were very uninvested in the community (at least the North American community). Eventually, all community moderation on the official forum was abandoned, and it was left to the trolls. Community correspondence was forgotten, alienating the ENTIRE playerbase. 

Lootboxes and legalized gambling was prioritized, so much so that new tanks are just flat out NOT released for free or for sale anymore. They are all in rigged lootboxes with 0.2% droprates, and to make up for this the tanks inside these crates are VERY overpowered. 

The developers were ousted. The majority of the original development team has been phased out of the game, and the new team, comprised of a laughably small group for a reasonably sized title like this just does NOT listen to community feedback anymore. Wargaming's games have always had issues with balancing, but community feedback insured a constant addressing of the issues. This game just does not have that anymore, and as such it is in a constant state of going from unbalanced, to MORE unbalanced. 

Over the course of the last four years the community has rotted into decay. Much of the old-guard of the game's community has vanished, and what you are left with is a old few clans like Triarii or VOID trying to hold on amidst a sea of vulgar, idiotic new players that come and go in a week after blowing $100 on crates. And that's exactly how Wargaming wants it. 

As it stands, Blitz is slowly going to pieces, and it is probably not going to get better. Another couple years and the dated 2014 graphics will start to show their age, and Wargaming HQ will have the servers closed permanently. 

If you are reading this as a veteran player looking to see if it is safe to come back, I'm sorry to say the answer is no. If you are a new player, I recommend to steer clear of this title, and let it die in peace.

"
8819,"I reccomend this game to be played by someone you can comunicate with, why, beacuse the player here is so random and most of them can't even communicate, most of them are not Cooperative though This game requires teamwork to win"
8820,"i love this game. The tanks are great, sounds of different shots coming from different type of tanks is awesome...however theres a down side to an up. Some days i cause massive damage and yet i get 1000s dollars in penalty. Other days tanks i can penetrate easily becomes unaffected by close shots let alone from afar."
8821,"I've played the game since around 2015-2016 on multiple accounts. I throughly enjoyed the game back then, however, now it is not as fun or attention grabbing. 

The teams have worsened over the years. I cannot go a single battle without encountering someone is just a drag on the team. 
The MM system is utter dog shit. Over a 30 game survey, all of my teammates WR were below 50%. 
To many new anime tanks/fake tanks are being brought in, making the meta of the game so weird and difficult to adapt to.  
I cannot play this game anymore without being mad at the game it self, or enjoy the griding aspect of it. There is no more qeunie fun for me in this game. It was fun while it lasted."
8822,Great game! love hanging with friends and co-tankers. Love the updates and new things Wargaming does in here. please keep it up and thanks.
8823,nice
8824,bots in tier 1-7 make all stats worthless and its been that way for almost 2 years now. money sink and premiums will never be nerfed - unacceptable thinking that you wouldn't see in any moba genre game. avoid at all cost this.
8825,"Some things should be improved, but overall it is fun to play."
8826,I enjoy the game but there are times where the game is no longer fun and I would need a break. It is not a perfect game. it is quick and simple battles and if you want to have fun you would have to commit to the game on for a long time I'm not sure about steam play hours but I have started playing on mobile before moving on to steam to play blitz. games can be fun and garbage at times especially with teammates and RNG its not everyone's cup of tea. give the game a try until you are around their 5 and decide there are a lot of play styles
8827,"I will give you my cons and pros about this game.
Pros 
- nice graphics for a game that is design to play on smart phones
- a lot of players are online all the time so you do not w8 a lot for the match to start
- fun events that if you are a skilled player and you have time on you hands you can  win stuff
Cons
- there are tanks that are overpowered 
- not too many options to change in the settings menu
- too many premium tanks in the game
- I do not like the idea to sell to players containers with low percent drop of a good premium item (if you buy some item from the store give this item 100 % not trick the player that it can drop at 5% rate)
If you have time play the game."
8828,great game free to play
8829,норм игра
8830,"Great game play, great dev team, constant updates to make the game flawless. the only down side are the players. players have a tendency to be salty when they lose."
8831,Good
8832,yes
8833,"I enjoy this game quite a bit. Play almost everyday.
I also like to collect tanks. There are over 200 in my garage from tech tree to collector and premiums.
So much fun.
However, match maker is terrible some days and you will have to deal with people who are well below 40% win rate (WR) on your team from time to time.
Its free to play, but having some premium and collector tanks makes for better credit accumulation. 
"
8834,Very Good.
8835,<3
8836,"Shoot tanks, get xp and cash, buy better tank. Good stuff"
8837,good game but some buyable tanks are pay to win
8838,Awesome game.-. Got dozens of premium and collection tanks without paying money. Looking forward to your nw collaboration with Games Workshop.
8839,GREAT GAME FOR  PLAYERS OF ALL SKILL LEVELS
8840,güzel gibi amk ama adamların tankı güçlü olunca ananızı sikiyor
8841,great fun
8842,nice competitive and fun
8843,yes
8844,"Much faster mini WoT , would recommend if you're in a rush or don't have a computer strong enough to run WoT"
8845,good game quick to pick up and play for quick battles.
8846,"Very Nice game, I like the graphics, gameplay, and much great matchmaking makes this game becom most recomended game"
8847,"Really great and fun game, my game loads really slowly on the steam version though, not sure how to fix it but still."
8848,yea
8849,"in a lot of ways, i like WOT Blitz for what it isn't - the game doesn't require a particularly deep commitment,  nor breathtakingly beautiful. It's fine on low spec settings. matches don't take much time to complete. grinding your way through tank levels happens at a reasonable rate. but, if you have a life and can't devote daily hours to a game, it's a nice way to blow stuff up. yes there's paid content, but you don't have to buy in to have fun. but that fun depends on whether you like to blow stuff up or no (i do). good luck!"
8850,"A list of improvements can be made. I believe money is the driving force here.Wot wants to get the widest device use for the widest audience. Players should expect to pay if they want to advance to the higher levels.The game can be addictive( in a fun way) and the players need a thick skin when dealing with the toxic child players. Overall it's a fun game and gets better at the higher tiers because players are more experienced,more helpful and less toxic. The game itself is simple it's the players that keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next and that's why I keep playing."
8851,this is a really good game and i recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing online
8852,"it is a fun game really dont go for the real world of tanks....also be a bit patient and the fun will soon start at tier V

Edit from the future:This game is not what it used to be,the matchmaker is bad,the playerbase goes afk a lot,many premium and battlepass tanks have been added that ruined the fun cause they are powerfull,the tutoral got changed into a worse one(actually doesnt teach you main mechanics that the old one used to) and many more that old players can easily point you out"
8853,I find the game really interesting. If you like strategies its the game you need! Also you can learn a lot about history and ww2 :)
8854,"greta game, very addicting, and very glad that there is a PC version of the game."
8855,it's alright
8856,gr8 game
8857,Отличная игра
8858,"Great game and you can play for free.  You can get hooked with it but in a great way and worthly game for the long term
"
8859,"Its a good game, but need spend a cash if u want play comfortably"
8860,Cool game probably best android game BUT wargaming company likes to milk monay out of you... but is not pay to win! people dont realize you need to be experienced to play properly higher tires... currently there are noobs in all tires even in 10 becaus some can buy tham selfes faster ways to top tires.. so if you dont like spending monay just know you are getting to top tires the legit way and will be alot better teammate and so all 7 players i team will have better time
8861,nice
8862,"Used to be good, now unfortunately its being ruined by very poor teamwork."
8863,If you like pay to win then this is the game for you if you like living and being happy then this is not the game for you
8864,Bad Gaem Don plaey pls
8865,"Love this game. Took me a while to work out the tank purchase 'tree' but all good now. I find the scoring algoritham to be very hap-hazard, it favours the games 'BUY MORE GOLD! imperative and in a way who can blame them, its a money making venture after all. Still a great game to play."
8866,"I have now played this game for a long time and there are many things I really dislike about it.

If you installed this game because you want to find out what tank battles might be like then FORGET IT!

This game is pure fantasy. Huge numbers of tanks are just made up nonsense, the abilities of almost every tank displayed have NOTHING to do with real tanks and WARGAMING are just hungry for your money.

These are some of the things that suck about this game:

1. PLayers who sit behind you and use you for cover and stop you from back getting under cover.
2. Players that enter a game and then do nothing with their vehicle leaving the team handicapped.
3. Players who come up behind you and push you forward into the open.
4. 'Paper' tanks. Ones that were designed on paper but never built. 
5. Modern tanks competing with WWII tanks. (This is just stupid.)
6. Lack of historic accuracy concerning abilities of vehicles. 
7. Money grubbing nature of the game trying to extract every cent out of you. Yes we know they have to make money but this is extortion.
8. Spending money = easy victory. You buy your way to victory in this game. 
9. Light tanks having firepower well beyond anything they ever really had.
10. Premium players having tanks that are almost indestructible.
11. Players using tanks with 'pea shooters' who sit on the far side of the battlefield from the action.
12. Players who hide and don't come to the aid of team mates when the fight is still winnable.
13. Tank hunters who sit up front with main battle tanks.
14. Players who sit side on to the enemy when their main armour is on the front of the tank.
15. The fact the buying gold becomes less and less good value. (Another blatant rip-off).
16. Shots that bend around corners and go through rocks when fired by premium players.
17. Tanks that completely submerge and don't drown. Once the air intakes go under the motor should stop.
18. Surviving a victorious battle, doing damage to the enemy and still losing a huge number of credits!
19. Tanks with ludicrous rates of fire (way too high). 
20. Tanks that vanish while they are in plain sight on open ground. This has happened even while they have been in my sights while I am firing at them.
21. Recently uncontrollable jerky screen and controls making it next to impossible to play properly.

The game could be really interesting but sadly is has been designed as a money pit with
everything designed to extract as much from players as possible. 

It is a bit of fun to play but don't expect too much from it. 

DON'T listen to the so called reviewers on YouTube who tell you which tanks are good to lie. I think they get paid by WARGAMING to promote rubbish tanks and they simply lie to you.

If you want to do well then learn the basics by fighting at tier 1 to 5 for about 1000 games. Then buy yourself a good premium tank or tank destroyer like an AMX 13 57 or an E 25. These will help you make credits and you will need credits if you want to get on and get more standard tanks without too much grinding.

Use the premium tanks to build up your credits, get to about 5 million (minimum) and then do a bit of grinding to get a standard tank. If you progress using this method you will spend less money and be far happier.

This game is just a shoot-em-up, nothing more. Don't expect too much and you won't be dissappointed."
8867,it's a really fun game and im very glad my BF introduced me to it. :3
8868,"Amazing game,................... but some time war gaming became too greedy when availing the New tank, as well as after new update version they Nerf the premium tank that u have bought recently which  one i don't like it,.. its far better to play the balance game WAR THUNDER"
8869,"This is such a great game! I.m plain for last 2 months , and there is much fun! 
It's really great game play, many strategies and kinds of vehicles.  

Strongly recommend to tray for any age people!

Enjoy your playing!"
8870,Broken piece of crap. Moronic t92 and sheridans broke the game into shit.
8871,"Well. I played this game a lot, have not mastered it.
This game has a lot to offer gameplay-wise and can run on very modest hardware.
Twitchy skills and lightning-quick reaction will certainly help you, but you will need to understand maps strategically, assess the current information tactically, foster teamwork and exploit enemy and teammates mistakes.
And, certainly, you'll need to learn to tolerate nubs. And being made into a nub yourself.

You'll have fun, you'll feel elated and frustrated.
You might become a unicorn in the process - more power to you!"
8872,Nice Game
8873,its a very fun and fast paced game.
8874,"-Fun to play
-Good graphics with the simple battleground
-Good looking tank
-like any other game without cash, you can not win easily
-""Techtree"" is non-logic, some higher Tier tank is much weaker than the previous one (exp: German Nashorn vs Sturer Emil). 
-The title ""Tank destroyer"" is meanless here when your tank is slow to very very slow, weak in armor, too big for the enemy to penetrate from all direction and the most important is the ugly bullets which act like normal, without using ""gold bullets"" you have less than 20% to cause damage to the enemy when face-to-face.
-I hope this game still has an update for me to enjoy more or will be uninstalled after a short time."
8875,"I could say a lot about wot blitz, it's at least my 2nd favorite game. Once you have ground out all the credits and vehicles you're interested in, your skill is the limit to the fun you can have, it's easy to complain about every little thing like the match maker or bad teams or pay to win, but that's just not here once you've got your techtree vehicles upgraded including crew. As for bad teams, the match maker and RNG, it is random, completely random, for every single player, that's what keeps it fun, it's never the same, no two battles are alike! (Be patient, watch the rich YouTube community videos about improving your win ratio and the vehicles you want and you'll be in for years of entertainment.)"
8876,"Great for the tank lovers and a pretty amazing pvp system. The ranking system is so difficult but not impossible. The only downside is the massive level of mirco-transactions, it is one that hinders gameplay. Makes it less fun when your get to tier V becuases of the massive amount of exp you need to progress starts getting awful and depressing. Unless you are willing to pay to play, then you should expect to put in hundreds of hours to reach the one of cool tanks. Make sure that the one you pick though is the one you want as going a for a different tank half way though means a hundreds more hours in game. payment should never stand in the way of progression and more people would play if it wasnt the case. Still has amazing game-play mechanics and would recommend."
8877,Good free to play PVP game + Tanks
8878,"Simply love this game, all the emotion's, enjoyable, frustrating, laughing and pulling out your hair. Great way to pass the time."
8879,good game for brawling and fast past shooting
8880,I've played WoT since beta. This is easy. Fun.
8881,just play it.
8882,it gud
8883,"I have played this game since version 1.0 back in 2014. those were much simpler times, with only 3 tank lines per country and only 3 countries! The playerbase was primarily experienced WoT PC gamers playing on their phones, and the gameplay was very dynamic and interesting. Since then, the game has seen some interesting changes, some of which I liked and some I didnt. The game overall has become less realistic in terms of battle dynamic, and over the years, various buffs and nerfs have been made to essentially equalize the playing field. This makes gaming more dynamic but not quite as varied, and while before, a player might need to learn a new playstyle for each tank they owned, it is more like the same 5-6 playstyles for all the tanks available (with a few exceptions of course.) I've seen many people say they need to dump money into this game in order to progress and be profitable, but it is clear to me that these people didnt play years ago. This is the most generous state I have ever seen this game. There were no in game events, containers, or anything of the sort to help players earn credits until around 3 or 4 years ago. I have only spent money on this game once, and it was in order to recieve a premium for ~10 dollars (super good deal too). I think its a great free to play game, and It certainly is free to win as well, because I have nearly every tank in the entire game at this point, and my 10 dollar investment had zero impact on this. 
 
Id also add that the player base has shifted quite a bit. Starting with more experienced players, there were waves of very young and inexperienced players afterward (which is why they had to implement a no-team-damage update). Currently there is a pretty diverse group of users, especially because there is cross-platform access. The community is still fairly toxic when people play poorly, but what can be expected from an online phone game... 

Its fun overall. Even after the egregious amount of hours I've put into this game (roughly 1600 on my PC, more on my Ipad and about 500 on Steam) the gameplay draws me back because its fast paced, balanced, and pretty simple to get the hang of. My only complaint is the angry hordes of kids cussing everyone out because they 'went the wrong way' and unfortunately thats something a developer can't fix!"
8884,good game
8885,"Constant fun, watch you don't start using premium ammunition because it gets expensive.  Just play with the standard rounds.  Skill will build up in good time."
8886,"This is a fun game to play with clans and a pretty good community. The match making system at times could use improvement and can cause frustration, by being placed with higher tier tanks with multiple battles in a row as well as unbalance players. All in all it's a competitive game and fun playing online with other clanmates, using discord helps improve the battle experience as well especially for tournaments."
8887,"For a free to play, its fun.  A little money can go a long way, but is not required.  It would just take you  longer to level up your tanks.  Is not a pay to win."
8888,"good
"
8889,"This Game is Okay. Its a fine experience, and a good game to burn time, but serious play means dumping large amounts of cash, which some people may not be able to afford."
8890,"Stale game, not much new after almost 8 years, events, daily missions and special game modes are so stupid as they will give you  daily/event missions that you won't be able to do in the special game mode, WOW so FUN right."
8891,Fun and addicting but has a few glitches here and there. The matchmaking could use some work but has come a long way from what it used to be.
8892,not bad for a smaller game of World Of Tanks.
8893,It feels like a project to get that blue win rate. This is not just point and shoot. The key to this game is to work with a team. The replay value is priceless. Best of all its free. Give this game a try.
8894,"I like, but:
>WoT PC is better, go play it
>Much more fun to play with your phone.
Don't let me stop you from having fun though, enjoy playing WoT:B!"
8895, Very interesting game #sponsorship #jokes
8896,"if you like torture, you'll like this game."
8897,"World of Tanks: Blitz is a game that's for everyone, but at the same time, not just anyone can play it. If you're going into this game thinking that it's just like any other shooter or arcade shooter, you're wrong, that's how you end up a 47%er when it comes to winning. It's slow at first because, well, Tier I tanks can be seen as ""early WWII production models"" in which tanks are newer, then later down the line, tanks are more modernized (as much as they can be for the specific eras) and gameplay gets more intense

[h1] The Good [/h1]
[u] These are the best aspects and quality of the game [/u]
[olist]
[*]Variety: There are a multitude of tanks of varying classes, with over a hundred tanks to choose from
[*]Cost: For what it's worth, it's a free game, and an amazing one for it's *cough* dirt cheap price (haha), you get access to a fully developed game that's constantly getting patches and updates
[*]Gameplay: There's four different...uh... ""classes"" which offer a variety of gameplay. Sure, you can use on tank to fulfill the role of another class, but it just wouldn't feel the same. It's like taking a sniper to frontline or using a tank to snipe. Sure, it COULD work, doesn't mean you SHOULD do it.
[/olist]

[h1] The Meticulously Extracted Hybrid (MEH) [/h1]
[list]
[*]Crossplay: Yes! There's crossplay! This can be seen as a good or bad thing depending on your stance on crossplatform games. You get to play with players that're on mobile or Mac, yay! You also get to transfer your data between platforms so if you started on mobile and got the Steam version, you can transfer your data and play on Steam with the same account and back. The bad part is: You play with other platforms that could be easier or harder depending on the platform your opponent is using. That means you can either bully them or get beaten like you stole their lunch money.
[*]Regions: Yeah you can't transfer data over regions. Let's say you're playing in the NA server and move to Russia. You can't transfer your data from NA to RUS, so you'll have to start over. It's also a good thing though, it prevents cross-servers so there isn't a ton of language barriers to hinder team communication
[/list]

[h1] The [b] BAD [/b] [/h1]
[list]
[*]The COMMUNITY (eughhh): It's toxic as Hell. I'm going to say this from the perspective of an NA-Server player, so I can't speak on behalf of other region servers...kids are toxic, wallet warriors are most the time 30% pay-to-lose, Hispanic players are [u] [b] USUALLY [/b] [/u] total garbage; they'll curse you out, say JAJAJAJAJA, and usually are the poorest performers on the team. Then there's wallet warriors who basically drop their life insurance on the game and think they're invincible because of their newly purchased tank...hint: they're not... And last but certainly not least, the toxic scrubs, the ones who claim this game is p2w. It's really not. Purchased tanks are, in theory, supposedly better than their researchable counterparts and it should be true. It SHOULD, not it IS; what I'm saying is yes, stat-wise, they're superior, problem is, most of the time, it's idiots and P2Ls that buy the tanks in which undermine the true value of the tank and the absolute destruction it could bring.
[/list]

[u]The Aftermath[/u]

Variety, poor matchmaking, toxic players, fun gameplay. Overall a well balanced trip!
But for real, you should try it at least once, but don't be that player everyone hates"
8898,very tactical and strtegic. Positioning and teamwork can help win hopeless battles and the tanks are all unique and fun to play 100/100
8899,You can dunk on people. Nuff said
8900,"If you love tanks, you will be happy to see many of them. But drawback is not too many options since only tanks from WWII, another one is their matchmaking rarely you got team that can fight till the end but mostly end up either with lame team or uber team .. quite frustrating and discouraging to play 

Recommended if you dont pay attention to your Winning rate and have deep pocket to buy some tanks for your collection and other perks. Other than that please choose another games or else.

Now is getting weird where feels P2W .."
8901,"Playing it since day 1!.
Love the physics, easy game.. and lot of fun!"
8902,Excellent!
8903,I like this game. Boom. Review done.
8904,war thunder much better
8905,"The game itself is very nice, I love the smaller version of the real World of Tanks. The fact that the game uses older tanks is also something i like most about it. Overall graphics can be set to very low, so even older computers can run this smootly.

But.. for people who don't game that much, it's almost impossible to have fun in this game. The whole community is based on a pay-to-win principle. Matchmaking is the worst i've seen so far. Almost 75% of the time you get set up in an overkill match. You don't even have the chance to do something, didn't see anyone and BOOM you're gone. When you play in a platoon it gets even worse. Me and my friend play this together a lot. Sometimes it's reasonable, but most of the time you just get a half a minute of driving, 10seconds of shooting and then gameover, lost with 0/7. I may not be the best player, but to loose 17 matches in a row. or a daily loosestreak of at least 5 is very discouraging and demotivating to play this game."
8906,Fun Game
8907,good
8908,one of the best tank warfare games ever
8909,Trash mobile game ported to PC for some weird ass reason with a janky u.i.
8910,Interesting game
8911,Fun Game I enjoy playing.
8912,"I first played this in 2016 on mobile, and I liked it. Now that I found the game War Thunder, the Tanks are better in that game. If you like a simple Tank game just play this, if you want kind of a realistic version play War Thunder.
Anyways, I do not like this game anymore."
8913,excelente juego sin necesidad de pay to win
8914,"10/10 game, it has slow start but picks up pace. i recommend it"
8915,i recommended this game
8916,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
8917,trash jk goodish
8918,good
8919,"I have to say, this is a great game.

I really enjoy the different tank types, the authenticity of the game and tanks (weight, damage, speed, armor, etc.), the in-game experience, tactics, strategy, etc.
The number of salty players also goes down, because in this game, You Can't Spam. So pretty much... if you die..... it's your fault.
Also, in World of Tanks Blitz, you don't have to worry about the matter of artillery shooting you from across the map.
The quality of the game is really good, not as good as World of Tanks mind you, but better than others.
If you like connecting up with people (like me), the game supports that as well with in-game chat (platoon, team and global) and out-of-game with friend chat! Like working as a team to get better? Well, you can calm down because they have that too!!!

Some things I do not like about the game:
I don't like how some PREMIUM tanks (which you either buy with real money or with gold which either comes from certain events or from buying with money) are so Over Powered that you pretty much can't stand against them.
Most offers in the store aren't using credits (in-game currency) but gold. I mean, I will give them some grace, when you have such a big game you should [strike] tax the crap out of the players [/strike] get them to use gold to buy awesome things.
Most of my complaints will be including premium so I will save it.

But overall I give this game thumbs up, 4 stars and recommend it to anyone who is interested.
Have fun Blitzing!
"
8920,teng berdarah
8921,Same 3 maps over again.  Lack of XP gains even with a booster or a X2 tank.
8922,класс
8923,nice game
8924,a lot of toxic kids but worth the laugh
8925,tanks
8926,love game
8927,"While it may technically be a mobile game, that does not downplay how great this game can be. there are so many types of tanks, playstyles (sometimes multiple playstyles in a single tank), nations, different game modes, etc. Basically, there's a ton of variety in this game. 

Pros and Cons to WoTB-

Pros: 
* Requires a great amount of skill in order to play well, and is extremely fun once you learn how to play a tank you've had trouble with
* Tons of tanks, with a great number of playstyles. You can either play as a long range supporter (such as a Rhm Borsig, FV4005, Grille 15), close range brawler (Maus, T-62A, Tiger II), Jack of all Trades (T110E5, Easy 8 Sherman, Chieftain Mk 6, IS-8), and so many more. 
* Winning a tough match is very satisfying, and will often reward you with a ton of xp and credits.
* Great maps that are very enjoyable to play on, with multiple routes and specific area's for certain tank types.
*Engaging gameplay, with detailed mechanics to make fights diverse. (such as alpha vs reload, armor vs pen, etc.)
Cons:
* Very team dependent game, if you get stuck on a sub-par team, its very hard to turn it into a win.
* More often than not, premium tanks are more powerful than their tech tree counterpart (Obj 252u and IS3).
* Playerbase is relatively toxic, don't be surprised when a ""teammate"" starts cussing you out in chat.
* ATGM's"
8928,The game was good at first but now it's pretty much just a premium infested shit-fest. There is no joy in winning there is no joy in losing only frustration at every round
8929,Like the Fb game that fell off but alot cooler and almost zero lag !
8930,"
It's an addiction to a shitty low spec low effort cash grab game that I can't shake.
For real, don't play this game, my wife and girlfriend left me.
The only way to progress in this game is by buying the GoLd PaCkEs and PrEmIuM SuBsCrIPtIoN.
I’ve sacked 136 hours I never get back.
I’ve must love self-flagellation for this game is nothing but torture.

Have seen worse"
8931,"fun fast paced game, I would recommend it"
8932,good
8933,"good game fuk
"
8934,i haved had this game
8935,"Awesome game very well made and apart from the small issue that some things are pay to win still I would recommend people to play this game even over its bigger counter part.
  I would like wargaming to fix some of the pay to win characteristics of the game. Keep it up"
8936,Cool game :D
8937,"Loved it
"
8938,yes.
8939,"Great fun!!!! Shoot em up!
"
8940,fun and enjoying
8941,"i have ...   no words from how good it is
"
8942,it gud dewds
8943,"Fun, quick, drop-in matches. I know it doesn't have the same complexity as WoT but its still fun to hop in and blast away for a short or long period of time."
8944,"the game itself is amazing, but its so p2w. classic wargaming move. 3/10"
8945,Its fun if you get a friend to play with you even on one computer. My friend loves to be the gunner while I drive and it is an experience
8946,good
8947,it fun
8948,gud
8949,"At the begging you might think that the game is not realistic the mechanics are trash and have other negative thoughts about the game. But after a couple of hours I can assure you that if you love tanks you will love this game's unique features and the mechanics it shares with regular world of tanks (like spotting mechanics and the aiming circle). They may not be realistic but they definitely  make the game far more interesting other titles. Personaly, after playing games like war thunder and regular World Of Tanks I got stuck with it."
8950,good game
8951,"It's good for low end PCs. Gameplay is repetitive if you think about it, unless you immerse yourself in it (if you're easily immersed with low end graphics even if it's set to max).

As for balanced teams; there are times of which you will be teamed up with players who go by themselves, and there are times when you're gonna be teamed up with open players who actually communicates throughout the battle. One thing is needed, if you wanna win a battle, and that is open communication throughout your team.

About the pay-to-win situation; I'm in 7 hours in with tier 4 tanks and so far, I don't see any PTW things here."
8952,LOVE THIS GAME..
8953,"If you have played WoT, don't download it.
If you haven't played WoT, don't download it either.
I have spent a lot of hours on the mobile,windows store and the steam version and spent well over 300 euros.
I can tell you that I haven't reached tier X(10) yet and i never will.
It's pay to win if you don't understand, no reason to play this.
 
Oh and by the way, matches are always full of bots/afk people/noobs/noobs with high tier premiums and so on. Community is also very toxic.

I hope this helped you understand how the game is and hopefully you won't fall in the same trap I did."
8954,its free! =-)
8955,Might be the mobile version but I enjoy it very much on my PC
8956,hecking tonks
8957,This game sucks. Once you upgrade your first and second tier tanks PTW players always kill you no matter what. Unbalanced game. Stupid. Uninstalled.
8958,Please Wot Release on Steam
8959,"Ive put 18 hours in it and it feels like too much, I love tanks and this game ruins everything for me, the game play is disappointing to me and so simplistic that I thought it was a children's game, I constantly had pay to win adds shoved in my face and is even more pay to win than titles like war thunder which i have 1400 hours in and recommend compared to this game"
8960,"good
"
8961,"Trash but well what are you gonna do, download Panzer War? Actually yeah I'ma do that."
8962,"This game is pay to win, and constantly gives annoying advertisement popups. They also recently added a new battle finished screen which gives me an extra 30 seconds of waiting time when finishing a battle."
8963,nice one for free
8964,Brainless is so much
8965,"I find this game great for working as a team with other users from different races, everyone has either the same type of tank or bigger but still gives great entertainment."
8966,"Well, some people might say it's pay to win, but nah you just need some skills and sometimes gold ammo and everything is okay"
8967,"World of Tanks Blitz is a lite version of World of Tanks, developed for mobile devices at first. It's a good compromise rather than the HD version of the game if you have a low-end computer. However, note that there are notable differences between the two versions, in Blitz:
[b]PROS[/b] (at least for me)
- Battles are faster and more arcade-based
- Tank upgrades don't require credits (only xp)
- There is no artillery, a very good point imo
- Daily/weekly missions are simpler and more engaging
[b]CONS[/b] (compared to the HD version)
- There are less tanks, obviously (and some are in loot boxes...)
- Most of the low-tier HE guns have been removed with the update 5.5
- Crew management is almost inexistant, with only crew skills to upgrade
- Maps are smaller (arcade), simpler and there are few but honestly it's enough
- There are one-battle monetized boosters: shame, but it's the economic model...
Currently, I have ~3600 battles on my account and I'm at tiers VIII-X on most tech trees."
8968,"it is a very fun game , its just sad that its losing players but i recommend this game because it is just as fun as World Of Tanks(its bigger brother)."
8969,Its really fun but kinda laggy.
8970,"For some reason I can't even play this game with even the lowest settings; and it isn't my computers specs to blame, as I can run the same game from the Microsoft store at the highest settings with 60 fps no matter the situation, compared to the 15 stuttering frames per second i get when i even look around the spawn on steam. Idk if this is just my computer, so please 
TL;DR: For me: Get this game from Microsoft Store, don't get it on Steam"
8971,"me like big metal box, go boom

"
8972,"Well defined dynamics, great overall gaming experience. The only downside is that its 60 fps max."
8973,Good Game!)
8974,Gud
8975,fun times
8976,it was fun
8977,"Easy controls, mostly fair teams with similar capabilities."
8978,me likey
8979,"fun, engaging, allows for a few different play styles, can play casual or go the hardcore route into ratings and tournaments etc. games up to 7mins long, 7 on 7 so games are quick. Can play on phone or tablet too"
8980,sadly but tasty
8981,"ha ha, tank goes boom"
8982,"Not a bad. It is a good game to play with a friend 8/10
"
8983,You never see your battle results. You do not get any options in upgrading your tanks. It is just a one way street. You can only do what the game dictates.
8984,"This game is [b]AWESOME[/b]
[list]
[*]Good Graphics
[*]Epic Gameplay
[/list]"
8985,good game
8986,"Good fun, even for beginners...
"
8987,It's really fun and addictive.
8988,The game is good but there comes a time when you don't have sufficient funds for the upgrades and then you'll have to spend some money or loose a lot of battles.
8989,Prime example of how a good game with great concept and style can be brutally brought down by money hungry developers
8990,bainless
8991,"It took me 35 minutes to get into a single match, this games dead"
8992,good game
8993,nice
8994,"I keep on loading things and cannot interact with many menus, didn't experience this a lot back then, but now i am stuck in shops, battle pass, item box, it's very annoying. i don't even know how much long do i need to wait for it to load

8995,Its a nice game for free
8996,yy

8998,good !
8999,Great game
9000,nice game i like games with ww2
9001,Yes it's a very fun game except team communication is practically non-existent
9002,Good
9003,GUD GAME:)))))
9004,"Very addictive game. You get to compete with people and always want to win, but, unfortunately, that is not possible :)"
9005,Updates are getting better and better each time. But they still need to fix the matchmaking issues where sometimes you get thrown into an absolute BOT of a teammates.
9006,:D
9007,Love it
9008,Good
9009,"Nice to play on the beginning but there are only three maps on the start, level III tanks from a nation are much better than the same  level on other nations, it is ridiculous the difference."
9010,yesh
9011,"This is a great mobile game, but a terrible PC game. If you want to play World of Tanks on your PC, please do yourself a favor and download the PC game from wargaming's website."
9012,e
9013,god
9014,"Quicker gameplay than ""daddy"" WoT  and runs on much lower specs but some stupid ""space invader "" tanks spoil the party and don't belong"
9015,yes
9016,ok for the android version
9017,very fun
9018,"Pay2Win but its ok
"
9019,"This game is a joke. 

Toxic community, useless player support. They only want your money and leaving you with nothing. If you want to become irritated because of kids who are trolling every game feel welcome that's game for you!"
9020,"a simple to use platform that is fun to play, quite authentic looking vehicles quality of the game is great. all in all a fantastic game for great value"
9021,just a fun time waste if you like tanks. guys make a fun game. theres room for light and competitive players
9022,World of Tanks with smaller teams and no artillery.  Plus it'll run on a terrible computer because it looks like actual World of Tanks did 9 years ago.  Downside: Lootcrates.
9023,"I played WoT for a very long time, and this one is good for potato pc but no one stopping you to play it on a powerful pc anyway

I thought without arty everything would be total sucks bcs I have no one to rely when I can't penetrate my enemies, but it turns out to be a more relaxing one, and I couldn't say the normal WoT is better... because some might finds it better because there is no pesky arties to deal with"
9024,simple game play and a reasonable rate of success
9025,"This game is garbage. Its only for mobile phones, looks awful and the controls suck on pc.
Dont play it on PC. I just use it too log my World of Tanks time. Never played this mobile piece of garbage."
9026,Was very good earlier - now its a Very High Ping and laggy Game!  Sucks
9027,"Insta gratification, and cheaters. Not a good combo"
9028,Great battle based on WW II tank!!!
9029,Don't play if you haven't got a rich grandma
9030,"Amazing game where i can TANK a Tank, and fly with a Tank"
9031,yes
9032,It's annoying when a game tells you what to do.
9033,"kinda greedy pay to win model, game isn't very good, try another tank game"
9034,It is a fun game!
9035,The tanks are awesome but the game is expensive and they are pushy on gold purchases.  Still the tanks are AWESOME!  Very fun game.  I highly recommend it.
9036,Game is nice just had some ping issues .. Its normal
9037,Nice game recommended for everyone!
9038,very good goog game go to play
9039,its a Tank game!!!
9040,nice
9041,O Jogo é Brutal
9042,Good game if you have nothing to do.
9043,awww yeeee
9044,Really good game and kind of free to play friendly.
9045,More forgiving than WoT.  Fast paced and fun... but a huge money suck to advance!
9046,it is good game
9047,I have to say it is definitely a pay to win game but even if you don't t is a fun game. I have grinded to a few tier 10's. There are many updates and events. Over all it is a fun game. ( I don't have hours on steam I play on IPad)
9048,Goooooooood Game
9049,"Fun,  Challenging.  Free play requires time and patience to win credits for new tanks."
9050,If you like tanks this is for you.
9051,already gone pro
9052,What is with the insane lag? i don't have internet issues as other games run super smoothly. but to my shocker. world of tanks is like an app with arthritis. click fricking backwards and it takes a whole 2 seconds before your tank becomes naruto and teleport jutsus you across the map. i mean this is ww2 based right? nobody told me anything about teleporting tanks. but anyways. pretty much it.
9053,Same game as wot.
9054,"Not a bad game , can be a lot fun."
9055,"Reminiscent of old tank games, it offers great fun at little to no investment. Selection of tanks if ridiculous, but must be earned through either heavy grinding or mircotransactions (which aren't very micro). Matches are fast and idle time between is minimal. Grind becomes heavy around tier 5/6. Still fun team game"
9056,i love this game
9057,unless you are willing to splash the cash the grind due to unbalanced mm may leave you hitting the f key... alot
9058,its amazing but the graphics could be better.
9059,Just awesome
9060,A very Good Game and Interesting. But the performance is so much useless. It does not have the backend infrastructure to support this game
9061,n/a
9062,NICE
9063,"Yes

9064,Play it at your own risk. It's dangerously addictive.
9065,Good Game. You should play it.

9067,"all in all a very good and very fun game, for a loooooooooooong time :-)
1000+ hrs and still playing :-)

maybe a bit more balancing of tanks but still great"
9068,Bitchass niBBa took my wallet dry
9069,good game if u have good wifi
9070,"It's almost like playing a FPS game, it's that immersive."
9071,like
9072,"It's alot more simple than the original World of Tanks, much better for the casual gamer. If you have a brain you'll be able to stomp most people at tank level 4 and below. Have played probably 50 hours between computer and mobile phone version."
9073,"love the game to death,,,,now add land mines to it and make it hard playing...if a tank could get a land miner dropper,like so much per tank..make the game more real"
9074,"Говно ебаное.

9075,im glad they made it for all platforms
9076,The kids and I love this game.
9077,This game is wonderful and the devs are always coming out with new content.
9078,"I've enjoyed it much more than it's predecessor, for whatever reason.  If you tried World of Tanks and liked the idea but not the implementation, give Blitz a try."

9084,Good game for low PC
9085,"The game is awesome, but when you start play with class V veichles, gap between standard and premium players is really too much.
While you do 60-90 damages and have hulls with 400-500 hp, premium can have ammos that does 200-320 damages in a single shot.
Totally unbalanced."
9086,When Your PC is Low end but you still want play WoT.
9087,"nice game i love this game

maybe if you are lucky even more...!

9092,"really good game,even my laptop can play it!,I recommend this game to anyone that love tanks but have low end laptop/pc and can't play games like war thunder,etc.if you can play both of the games i mentioned,then play both of them"
9093,enjoyable and challenging
9094,PAY TO WIN
9095,"World of Tanks Blitz is a very adictive game, somewhat like playing fortnite but with tanks, it's multiplayer online but you don't have to interact with others if you don't want. Having said that, I think the strength in the play will be in teams, which I have yet to explore."
9096,It is fun!
9097,"Malade !
"
9098,Pay to get reminded that you need to pay even more to win. Findom of a game
9099,Fun game once you get the hang of it.
9100,"Very nice and good game, like that it's realistic"
9101,"me gusto
"
9102,Graphics are incredible.  Amazing Depth of Data Integration and Design.  It's addictive!
9103,"good game
"
9104,"This one  takes a lot of time, so play and enjoy if you have a lot of free time or of course if you are a wallet player because this is a huge thing in this game"
9105,"i CAN'T HELP FEELING THE GAME IS RIGGED,. Too much inconsistency; in the lower tiers, hit results elicited different outcomes and wins alternated almost on a 50/50 basis now in order to progress you have to spend more & more to upgrade features which are almost negated by your inclusion in a higher tier and higher spec'd opposition.
What absolutely S%*t team allocations. Multiple losses where the other team wins 6 and 7 to nil. Games are rigged. PC players appear to be punished on sensitivity, accuracy, dispersion etc."
9106,"good it is good pls respond
"
9107,"its fun
"
9108,Great Game
9109,Same pay to play like wot on pc =]

9111,Beast game
9112,I am a long time world of thanks player (not on steam tho) i have an 8 year account on war game... what ever it was called and i do like blitz but too low guailty for me so i will stick to the normal one
9113,mantep lur
9114,Good action game
9115,very good game
9116,"A lot of fun. Tons of tanks, each with a different style of play and role.
Just remember, it isn't a hiding or sniping game, if you are not in a tank that is made for doing that."
9117,Everything.
9118,Excellent game. Quick to get into. Quick battles win or lose. Good tech tree to upgrade equipment and good variety of tanks. I prefer the quicker tanks with less firepower so I can get around the maps to outflank the enemy. Very good stable game.
9119,You remember that scene in Fury where they run into the Tiger tank and barely make it? The enemy team are all Tiger tanks and your team are a bunch of apes with wheelbarrows.
9120,"I Love this Game , would like bots in a traing room (privet) so my Grandson and I  can play together and teach him :-)
"
9121,very good
9122,it's game is good but i hate tryhards and hackers
9123,Not a good game. Reminds me of a mobile game. Which is not a good thing at all. Don't play it.
9124,"it's awesome , if u like know about it , please play it!"
9125,nice
9126,Great game for not so fast computers. It is worth your time. What is great about this game is that it is free.
9127,"Fuckin love it, had it for the phone, got wot for pc, decided it was too sweaty and now i'm hitting this hard. Way more casual, a lot of fun super fast."
9128,Honestly the longer you play this game the more rigged it seems.
9129,"This game was so awful, I shot a 12 hp heavy tank point blank in the back and got no damage at least three times, then I died from how bored I was. I made a purchase with in game currency twice and neither of the purchases were put on my account as well."
9130,Brilliant game byt a normal player without money will never do well.
9131,"It is fun, even if you don't pay
The gameplay is very enjoyable, I like that the tanks are based off of real tanks.
One problem, if you are playing with more than 1 friend, you have to do a private match, it would be nice if we could do public matches with more than 2 people."
9132,FUCKING TRASH only 60 fps on GTX 1080
9133,Another pay to win game
9134,"This game is what you can expect as a gamer from a game. You can shoot tanks, spot them and game highlights them. Movements and controls are as smooth like butter. I thoroughly enjoyed this game."
9135,"Tank go Boom 
Other Tank go Boom
Fun Time"
9136,While this can be seen as a pay to win game it doesn't have to be. If you like a challenge and dont mind committing to the grind it can actually be quite fun. Matches are fairly balanced despite what I had read online before playing it.
9137,"You will really enjoy this game when you make a tank OP because it's played by you. 
P.S.: My first was Grille 15 , constant <100 rank in EU server."
9138,very good and nice game
9139,"Do yourself a service and never get involved with Wargaming company, even if you love tanks.

As a person that likes tanks himself sadly i admit that theres no good pvp tank game currently on market.
Corporate suits just see our mature audience group as big bags of cash and try to milk us as much as possible, ruining games in the process."
9140,"I don't have much playtime with this on PC- only ~15 mins xD. But i have played it on Android before and let me just say how trash the graphics and the audio is. It's sh*t on android, underwhelming graphics, next to no visual effects(e.g. firing main gun sounds and looks like shooting popcorns from a BB gun)..... And the PC version feels like it was directly ported from the android version. Absolutely no/minimal improvements, very very dull and uninteresting. But if you're one of those ""graphics dont matter, the game does"" people - well, the game is not any better. But feel free to go ahead and see for yourself. War thunder and Armored Warfare are better (somewhat) if you really want a Tank Shooter. World of Warships is also a great game (unlike this one)."
9141,Wheel around in famous tanks and blow stuff up. What's not to love?
9142,This PvP tank combat game offers lots of customizable vehicles and fun gameplay. You can have lots of fun playing the free version but expect to do a lot of grinding to get the higher-tier vehicles.
9143,If you don't want to rage quit and break some screens i suggest playing blitz instead of normal WoT. At least in this game you won't be destroyed by a random arty shell
9144,it is good
9145,Говно ебаное блять.
9146,"The Game itself is a very good small version of World of Tanks. It may seem a bit pay to win at first glance, however, it does not require you to pay real money to make progress, but patience. Some of you might disagree, but what good would a game be if you got everything on the first few times you play it?

But unfortunately, not everything is good about this game. And its not the game itself, but the community. You need strong nerves in order to cope with some of the shitstorms people might throw at you. Personally, I only witnessed something like that on WoT EU, and not on the european server of WoT Blitz, but you may never know.

All in all, the game itself is very fun to play and a well done mobile version of World of Tanks, but you sometimes need patience and good nerves.

I hope my rewiev was helpful. Thanks for reading!"
9147,has a lot of problems when logging/signing in but it's still a good game and it looks fantastic
9148,Its a very fun game to play with or without friends. It is also flexible with how old your computer is. Its one of the only games that I can get more than 10 fps in with my old to dinosaur times computer. Best thing is that its free.
9149,ok
9150,yes
9151,gg
9152,"Blitz is a mobile port, so you're better off to just play the original World of Tanks. This is the same game but with less tanks, poorer graphics, and inferior gameplay. Wargaming really should bring the original to Steam like they did with World of Warships."
9153,Nice game but still you can be the better judge simple and interesting
9154,gud

9162,"far more better than the pc version just so much more fun 
"
9163,"Fun, Challenging and entertaining.
Easy to play"
9164,"The game itself is decent, relatively fun. But the many mechanics are extremely unsatisfying. choosing tanks with more unbalanced characteristics doesn't really change anything. Having a bigger gun just means more damage with longer reload. The penetration basically doesn't matter. Also the tanks don't really have weak spots like in war thunder. You can shoot anywhere and still not really do anything."
9165,"Do yourself a favour & don't be sucked in by this free game.  The constant one-side matches, the grind of win_v_lose streaks will wear you down.  War Gaming are greedy when it comes the price to buy tanks, gold, boosters, training if you want to be more competitive & progress decently with upgrades to your tank/skills.  Don't fall for it.  Don't install it."
9166,"Not bad, little p2w but overall decent game"
9167,i love this game
9168,I liked the combat and the way of upgrading tanks.
9169,really fun and good game to play
9170,yes
9171,"Less sophisticated than the original, and full of very aggressive and annoying marketing to purchase everything, but has fun, fast-paced battles."

9184,German tanks make me cum.
9185,"I like the main game better (World of Tanks) and It's better in all categories but I still find this ""Lite"" version (mobile version) very appealing, simplistic and easy to get on.

Score: 7/10"
9186,"Fun game, fast paced with interesting battles, starting to like it more than WoT"
9187,Pay to win
9188,"It's World of Tanks but one tenth of the file size and half of the time for a match. It's very addictive. Graphics are low key so don't expect much there. The tanks look good, there is a large learning curve, and will take a lot of grinding no matter how you approach it. Spending money on tanks and gold won't really do anything special for you. My experience with the pay side so far is that you pay cash for a tank to grind faster, and it is sub par. I'd go so far as to say you pay to lose in this one. I find that amusing. It's all about skin really when you break it down. It's no advantage, a good game!"
9189,Relaxing game.
9190,It has a fun experience to players who like tanks. It's a new way of battle.
9191,"As many War Gaming Gamers out there say: ""4gigs of blitz fun"""
9192,"Nice game, I also recommend play the original WoT ;)"
9193,"fun to play, lots of hours involved if you want to upgrade anything. needs easier accumulation of points /credit"
9194,WEOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
9195,the game was good its still is but then you can pay any other game. i just wish they in prove it.
9196,"Great game!   While you don't need gold to win, it helps to buy a little.  Get a heavy premium tank and grind it for credits.  I say heavy because there are no real tutorials on how to play and heavy tank gives you more chances to win...but learn the role of a heavy tank.  It's not to snipe at the back of the map :D  If you want to be a good player, the best advice I have is to go to youtube and search wotb videos.  Learn the roles of each tank and increase your winning percentage.  You also need a good internet connection to play well.  Very fun games and usually less than 5 minutes per match."
9197,Kv2
9198,like
9199,Awesome game for Tank Fanatics !!!

9212,shit game not play that
9213,really good for a mobile game
9214,It's just a regular World Of Tanks with same level of paying
9215,Mom...
9216,"good
"
9217,"Decent tank game if you have an interest in them.

Since it's WoT, it's a bit arcady and since it was meant to be a mobile game, the graphics are a bit trash (still good for a mobile game though). In terms of gameplay, it's quite a simple game with no confusing hud's etc. Sometimes you do come across toxic players, but that's just how it is with PvP games. 

Adverts about premium tanks are a bit annoying and some ""made up/fictional"" tanks are straight out broken, especially if a veteran is playing in them. Playing with premium tanks is quite pointless, since the XP you earn with them still need to be transformed to normal XP using gold, a PREMIUM currency.

Anyway, the game is not too big in size so if you're bored, try it out yourself. Also have fun getting through tier 8.
"
9218,asia sever so hig ping
9219,Great game
9220,"I only have 4 hours into this but thats only from me trying out blitz to see if it was any better than the original world of tanks. It just has fewer players in a match and thats it. It's pay to enjoy rather than pay to win, but to enjoy it you need to win other wise anything takes forever. Even if you do get stuff you never really enjoy it. This is mostly because of the matchmaker, it gives you either the same tier, 2 two tiers above so you are worthless, or two tiers below, so you can bully the enemy. What is bad is that tanks a tier or 2 higher than you are almost way better than yours. It has purposely been made this way to frustrate you and bait you into spending money. (Even worse is that if you just get a tank and it's ""stock"" you will get crushed if you are uptiered. It gets worse the further along you get into the game as the costs to get anything start getting ridiculous) This game is steeped in RNG and your crews skill levels affects your accuracy and your manueverability among other things. Want a good crew? Either play alot through the frustration or just spend gold and get 100% crews. Of course if you want to be on an even playing field you'll want a good crew. Just really looking at everything from playing the non blitz version of this game it's very clear this game is not a good use of time. At most the best enjoyment you can get out of this is a time waster, anything other than that takes alot of dedication and time to get really good at this.

 If you really want to play this for some reason don't buy a single thing it's never worth it, if you want premium tanks for free you can do clan war stuff, but thats where the time and dedication comes into play. If you ever want to get into a clan you'll be greeted by immature people who want you to win alot of matches. To win more you need to get into platoons with other people but you'll want better people to play with to win more. This is where toxicity comes from the frustration that people struggle to get any enjoyment out of this game which is steeped in RNG and bad design choices made to purposely infuriate you. It's like any other f2p games lots of ,frustration and little payoff unless you start dedicating tons of time for potentially little effort and salt. Later on in the game with higher tier tanks you just realise it's the same shit but a different ball room. Maybe the tanks have funny little quirks, but you just never find yourself caring. There will always be bad tanks to make you frustrated, op tanks released to incentivize you, and updates that change the meta to keep you hooked on a game that pretends to care about you, but cheats on you with your grandma and is really bad at pretending it isn't going on even though your grandma tells you every day shes fucking him. Then the game pays people to call your grandma to shame her for telling the truth, even thanks to the games addictive tendencies you'll find people defending it.

A few things to know are : OP tanks are released on purpose to get people to spend gold to free xp it (xp that isn't spendable on tanks due to researching everything is locked to that tank, you can spend gold to make it free xp and spend it on anything), mostly whales do this and are the profit for wargaming. People in good clans just use their free gold. These tanks are usually later nerfed though. There are tanks which are mediocre added to the game to frustrate you and make you spend gold. If you are a low tier tank and are uptiered you most likely won't be able to do much if you have no upgrades, you can ""try"" and do stuff like spot and flank but you'll probably not do too much. Of course Light tanks are meant to be uptiered and scout though, of course there are trees which purposely have tanks just before a medium or heavy but theres only a few I know of I stopped playing forever ago. Play russia as a starting nation, you may have good results. Most likely because the devs are russian but this is unconfirmed. Russia is confirmed to be a corrupt nation which sponsors the brainwashing of it's children in boot camps. They won't tell you this though as it's mostly controlled by oil barons who got land super cheap after the collapse of the USSR.

Just don't play this it, it's starts out purposely fun and pew-pew ish but soon you find yourself getting into tedious situations with no pay-off. Theres so much to describe but I won't waste any more of my time on this. Literally everyone and their grandmother have said the same shit I have. Go look it up!"
9221,"It's fun, it's fast, and often very challenging."
9222,good game lost of tanks
9223,great tank war sim.
9224,Get World of Tanks from the there website.
9225,its fun
9226,Fun tank game. I like a marble mouse for aiming.
9227,no.
9228,"Played about 3 rounds and won all 3, 0 deaths and 2 kills on average.

At the end of the day, the winner in this game is the one who shot first and positioned their tank so the sides are not exposed. That's it. Not much skill involved, if any.

There's not much strategy involved either as when you play with the higher-tier tanks, it all comes down to who upgraded their vehicle more.

I give it a 5/10 - it's an okay game to pass the time but if you have anything better to play, you're better off playing that instead."
9229,is good
9230,"Good tank game,but a little bit p2w. Premium tanks,especially VK 100 has very strong armor and powerful guns.
"
9231,I hope you're ready to be let down by your teammates not having any sort of strategy and somehow getting themselves surrounded by an outnumbered enemy. Seriously the balance and matchmaking in this game is garbage and the players are functionally retarded.
9232,"I have played this game for quite a while now and have to say they do keep it fresh and exciting with different. tournaments, special but temporary game modes and such. The attention to detail on the maps are are amazing and the artwork is just downright gorgeous. There are issues though, for example I have been playing MMOs since there were MMOs and I have never seen such a toxic community of players in my life.  If you're on a team that is losing expect to be called every name in the book. It never dawns on these people that sometimes the other team is just better that match. Wargaming even had to remove the ability for people to send you chat messages because of the griefing. This game has its problems beyond the user base, ATGMs come to mind. Though to be fair Wargaming is trying to address the balance issues that unfortunately they created."
9233,"lo jugaba en el celular y me cambie a computador, es una buena experiencia."
9234,"the game wont launch , it says error app already running , then it asks me for my review right after , so F.U this game pisses me off
"
9235,it is fun
9236,Yes.
9237,pay to win piece of shit
9238,Can't say about other servers but Asia server has a lot of lag on regular basis. I am located in Oceania and the ping is 300 sometimes. Can play on 150 to 200 but 300 the game becomes very laggy. I actually have premium membership because it is good concept game but they need to invest more in their servers.  Even after posting ticket to them no response. No trouble for a few days but today back to 300. Other players online are also complaining.
9239,Its a nice game
9240,I LOVE THIS GAME - IT IS SO MUCH FUN - YOU ALWAYS FEEL A SENSE OF PROGRESS

9244,"I JUST LOST MY ENTIRE SAVE AFTER IT SIGNED ME OUT OF MY ACCOUNT AND REQUIRED ME TO SIGN BACK IN. AFTER SIGNING BACK IN I HAD TO TAKE THE TUTORIAL AGAIN, ONCE THE TUTORIAL WAS OVER I REALISED IT HADN'T GIVEN ME ANYTHING THAT I HAD PREVIOUSLY (I WAS IN TIER V WITH LEOPARD). I LOVE THIS GAME BUT DID THIS SHIT HAVE TO HAPPEN. CAN THE DEVS SORT SOMETHING OUT FOR ME? COZ I'M NOT GONNA GRIND UP TO THE POINT WHERE I WAS."
9245,в эту игру весело играть с друзьями
9246,i think that wargaming made mistake it should be world of tanks normal no blitz
9247,"its a fun game!!!
"
9248,"It's a good game overall with gameplay, tanks, and interface. I don't have any problems with them but there's one major issue: toxic playerbase. I expected that already, it's world of tanks, bruh. If you can handle an angry russian kid that uses premium tanks spamming in the game chat then you can handle most of toxic players in this game."
9249,WOTWOT
9250,"Great game, much more dynamic than the regular PC version, easier to play with a keyboard and mouse than the tablet version.
The game is quite mature at this point with a good variety of tanks and maps. And it is quite a trill to always play with other human opponents.
Also, you can go pretty far without having to pay anything. One of the most generous freemium game in this regard."

9253,"If you don't want to be shot by every arty on the enemy team in the original game, this one is your best choice for fun."
9254,"I've started on mobile playing this game and I've had alot of fun by the time Wargaming was fair with all the stuff they put out, but after 5.5 is when the whole game went into P2W, bad match making, and bad deals WG does not care about what the community and what they say, pocketing the cash, I loved playing this game but now it is hard to play it and have fun with my friends, I'll still play it but i wont have much fun from back then, I suggest going to War Thunder and play there if you want fun"
9255,Good gaem.
9256,"Lootboxes, op premium tanks, toxic player base, no team game ( u r essentially against 13 players not 6 as expected), and terrible reporting/ranking system, premium passes for being able to participate in quests and more of that f.king lootboxes. No i do not recommend even though the other aspects of the game are good. Noooo!"

9261,Gut.
9262,"just takes too long to get a match, sometimes you can wait 3 or 4 minutes on some tanks."
9263,"The game was good, and I was spending money on it. Then they introduced the BATTLE PASS. The game is not worth playing now, unless you want to spend weekly to stay competitive. If you want a non-pay to win game. Look elsewhere"

9270,this game is perfect on PC.
9271,"Its alright, the grind is not too terrible.
The graphics suck thats all, the gameplay is where it is at
Pretty decent"
9272,"This game WAS fun. It has been ruined. i don't know what happened in the 6.10 update, but it has not only destroyed the matchmaking system but has incorporated a battle pass system like every other game. This game is no longer based on skill. It was about tactics and smart moves. Now it's based on RNG. I TRULY loved this game and spent a lot of money in it without shame but it is a lost cause. Don't bother playing. It's not worth your time, and I would recommend siege or CSGO."
9273,good game i enjoy it and idk what else to say other than each battle is different as there are so many tanks and quite a few maps
9274,Game is very fun and is not pay2win at all. Even the stuff you can buy with real money is very reasonable when it comes to prices. Game runs very smoothly even on very bad pcs. I would recommend to anyone that wants a free game to play that isn't pay2win and has bad pc specs.
9275,"Excellent game, I like so much, requires some strategic war attitude."
9276,the game is fun and there is so much tanks to choose from. It doesn't have to be pay 2 win to have fun. That's all that matters.
9277,"Amazing!
i play it every day, the mechanics are great, so is the gameplay
definitely reccomend playing!"

9295,"Please do not waste your time on this, definitely not worth it. The game begins with forced and slow tutorials and overall it's just a big pay to win experience.

9299,"fun  game to play, doesn't require money to play, plays easy through tier 5 then gets harder to play. save all the gold you get for gold tanks, you'll need a gold tank to make credits once you get to tier 6 tanks. buy that time your hooked on the game, only con is other players leaving rude comments when you don't play the way they think you should. free tanks are hard to get but you can get some of them, few and far between. very good game, thats fun to play
"
9300,(:
9301,"Decent Game, can be pay to win.

More time I played it (300 hours now) the more I like it. It is a money sink though as I get hard for every new tank that pops up in the store.

Pro's

1. Decent Graphics, Tank design and balancing
2. Decent balancing of the Maps.
3. Asian Servers I get to play with people from Azerbaijan

Cons

1. About half the players are arrogant fuktards and I can't tell them they are morons in chat as they have banned nearly every vaguely derogatory word under the sun (including moron)
2. You would cry if I told you how much money I have spent on a ""free"" game. There is No way to progress in any tank chain to level 10 without spending money (and if WOT tell you otherwise then they are lying)
3. Need dedicated Australian/NZ Servers."
9302,"This game used to be an awesome game, I played on mobile devices and PC combined more than 2 000 hours. And i specificly employed the therm ""used to be"" because the devs slowly ruined the game. Started by adding over priced, pay to win vehicles into the game, more broken tanks were added with ATGMs (rockets) that are rediculous since they can deal damage while being behind cover. They TOTALY IGNORE the opinion of their community and comunity helpers that are the one who are in contact with the players and the devs. We are losing a lot of our youtube content creators for the reasons listed, we are all frustrated insted of having fun while playing this game. #removeatgmsbringbackrolling

Update 14 dec. 2020: ATGMs have been removed, a step forward. But there is a huge amount of work left."

(PS to all of you try-hards who take this game too seriously, you should really consider going outside and getting some sun (if you even know what that is). Make some friends, get a girlfriend, do something with your life. If you really think you're so cool playing this game or think being good at this game actually means anything in the video game community or anywhere else (which it doesn't; think about the last time any real human being actually said anything about this crappy game) you're definitely a virgin with no friends or life)."

And the ""Premium"" tanks have limitations so, no, the rich dont always win, ie the BIG FAT tanks can punch HARD, one shot kills, BUT, the are slow and can only shoot every 20 seconds. PLENTY of time for a faster ""Weaker"" tank to get in behind and shoot him 3-4 times before he can shoot again. Faster tanks are made of paper and weak guns, so, things even out in the end. Pay or grind, this can be a fun game! (Just realize, only about 1/3rd the games are even, the other times either you overwhelm or are overwhelmed by experienced players."

9381,"Fun and free to play until Tier 3 and low Tier 4.

The moment you hit tier 4 and get an upgrade that qualifies you to fight with Tier 5 tanks, it becomes pay to win.

All of your attacks will bounce off or glance from the enemies and you will need to either grind for several hours a day for a week (or more) or pay for the gold/xp to upgrade to a decent tank in order to fight even. And it'll definitely be fun grinding for those points when your enemies can kill you in 3 shots while you'd be lucky to destroy them with 10."
9382,"Минусы

- Без доната сложная и длительная прокачка, налоги на каждый снаряд и ремонт танка, из-за чего можно уходить в минус и можешь даже потерять возможность выхода в бой

- Донатные дизбалансные танки

- Постоянная навязчивая реклама доната (например - выполненная донатная задача за боевой пропуск или реклама премиум аккаунта в КАЖДОМ бою)

- Союзники зачастую не способны сделать более одного результативного выстрела за бой

- Карты, в большинстве из них стратегия победы - поехать всей командой на ст фланг, на тт фланге как правило очень плохие позиции

- ивентный рандом

- отсутствие адекватного обучения игре

Плюсы

- Разнообразный геймплей на танках

- Фан режимы

- Оптимизация под слабые устройства"

We both get extremely frustrated with the game when team up with people that don't know how to play in the higher tiers, but being on a good team definitely makes up for it. Being able to worked out your tactics and trying to preempt the enemy is great fun."
9398,"oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
yes
"
9399,good
9400,Meh!!!
9401,"So, starting off I'd like to say my hours played are based on my computer hours, not mobile hours.
I've been playing this game for years and currently have 3 tier 8 tanks, with more tier 7s researched.
I do not recommend this game to anyone who is playing casually or if you're easy to anger.
So firstly you're going to think it's pretty easy right? You only need a couple battles to get to the next tier in low tiers. Wrong.
This game is not easy, low tiers are a bunch of bots and new players, so yeah it gets easy until you hit tier 5, now that's where  the pay-to-win starts to pop up, not only will you get paired against tiers higher than you, sometimes tanks who you CAN'T attack while they can attack you unless you have a flank on them. Tiers 4 and lower have SO much of a battle difference than tier 5s, think of it like a level 100 going down to low level players in a MMORPG and slaughtering them all.
Your gameplay is going to be plagued with bad teammates who never coordinate and just rush off into their own then spam the help button when they're in danger. You'll be using the complaint button way more than the Positive button. Once you reach tier 6 you start to realize the pay-to-win aspect of Credits, EVERY game you lose you get negative credits unless you bought a premium account. And trust me, if you're a returning player or new player, you're going to be losing way more than you think due to bad teammates and coordination. You also can't carry your teams, as much as you'd like to, the game isn't structured in a way to allow you to effectively carry your team, since you're fighting with tanks that act like RACE CARS or SNIPERS, tanks you can't even see despite the fact they way 20 tonnes because of the crappy visibility system that doesn't allow you to see people farther than 5 feet away. I find that this game is very frustrating to play since you're punished even if you do good in the game. Unless you're a ""wallet warrior"" you're never gonna earn credits and frankly, the premium tanks are much stronger than the regular ones. I'd like to mention the research system that is PAINFULLY slow, without a premium account you're going to be making 700 XP per win, 100 XP per loss, sounds good right? Wrong. Tiers 6s require anywhere from 23k-39k XP just for a tier 6! The tanks you find fun are going to be low level tanks that when you get the upgraded version, they're gonna suck. It gets to the point where it's not worth playing the actual game and you just go into training mode and collect XP boosters until you eventually want to play the real game.

TL;DR: bad teammates, pay-to-win mechanic, bad game mechanics, slow grind, not recommended."
9402,all the time putting me to the team with noobs..almost imposible to win a single game!
9403,.
9404,"Takes along time to master, hell of a good game though!"
9405,I like tanks ;p
9406,"the game is good
but there is
bad servers at least this European"
9407,it's cool
9408,Great and simple game.

9411,"nice game

9415,Best simple tank fighting game
9416,"more than 80% players didnt know rule of tank,  how can be medium and  light tank  doing snipe ? most of them just find a kill .MOST OF THEM LIKE BLAMING OTHER, high ping and loss game , its boring game its trash game"
9417,This is an amazing version of World of Tanks that works extremely well on low end PC's
9418,it is a good game GET IT ;]
9419,"It's fun to make tanks go boom, but remember you don't have to research everything.  That'll keep ya from spending too much of your hard-earned $$$."
9420,Go to game.
9421,this game can be really fun but from my what my list of tanks shows (i could be miss them or to stupid to figure it) not all tanks are there but overall this is a really great game
9422,"probably the worst , most fcked up game ever! started out to be a good idea, nice to play!  Then came those updates and stupid fcked up kids playing this game!   I dont know why publishers have to fck up a game so hard, but this is a shame!   The match making is completely unbalanced, with premium and spacial tank far to overpowered!  Then, the players, stupid kids that get everything up their asses, dont know anything from life, that dont play with respect or honor!"

9424,very nice

9426,"Here's my briefing after have played for over 8,299 rounds,
Likes:
1. Quick game per round, means you could squeeze time to play 5 times per day just enough to achieve most of the missions
2. Fun and always intrigued by the game mechanism, and it's competitive
3. Praise/Complaint teamwork system and REPLAY features give you channels to release anger
4. All tanks, no Artillery. Means you understand and convinced by how you died
5. Stable account info. I've paused for months due to the lack of interest and when I login back in, everything is there and up to date.

Dislikes:
1. Reading the map for me is hard... It's hard for me to translate 2D top view with perspective in a constant manner
2. There are decent amount of special (cash) tanks, so be aware that it's NOT gonna be a 100% fair game
3. It's fast to play, but it takes much much time to read the game and eventually, get a feeling of each of your tanks.
4. It's a SUPER long journey from tier 1 all the way to tier 10. So you may not have a chance to experience the top tier version before you quit play
5. The graphics, animation and sound effects are way much downgraded from the PC version. I know there are reasons for it but it's a fact

In the end of the day, I still play (53% win rate) and still play like a noob. There are so many good players in the game which makes the game so cool.
"
9427,"The more you play, the less fun this game becomes - which is odd for what seems to be a simple game designed to blow off some steam after work.

If you don't activate Premium, then your advancement turns into an epic grind. However with Premium enabled, and luckily the devs do give you plenty of free Premium time, the game is only somewhat fun as you try to achieve your build goals and daily missions.

As you advance however, you'll soon learn that as a newb, or a f2p, your mostly just cannon fodder for the ""special"" tanks and those running with Enhanced or Premium tanks.

The game mechanics can be fun, but are hindered by a lack of consistency (too much rng). Various game modes such as Moon or Mad Games are extremely funny at times, and will make you LOL a lot as long as your not the type of person that has to win more than 50% of the time.

If you try to run the game without Premium activated you will soon get a dreadful feeling you are only on the field to help the other teams' kill count, as your matches will always (statistically more than 50%) be unbalanced - almost like the game is trying to nudge you into buying some Premium time. 

You will also notice A LOT of ghost-shots (invisible enemies) ripping your tank apart while your map shows you nothing. At times it can feel like all the reds have you targeted, killing your tank before you even get a shot off.

The game has bugs galore, with enemies seeing you through hillsides, or buildings. At times you will be in the most hidden place, free of all LOS, and outside 100m range to the nearest bad, but you'll still be seen on the map. At times you'll shoot a red in a soft spot but the shot bounces or doesn't penetrate - this most will say is just bad rng, or lag - but this happens enough of the time that it is the norm.

All in all, the game is fun if your goal is 20-30 minutes of stress relief, play for the fun of it. If you take this game too seriously though, it will eventually let you down with bad match-ups, poor game mechanics, over-powered and under-powered tanks and far too many glitches in the field.

If you insist on playing this game, I'd only recommend it while you have Premium active.

Cheers"
9428,THIS IS A AMAZING GAME
9429,"Pretty entertaining for casual players. Faster crew member training than WoT(with or without golds). Lower xp requirements for tank research in tech trees. Faster paces of in-game experience. I think that's what ""Blitz"" is all about. Since it's ""derived"" from mobile platform(you can still play with mobile players), graphics performance can't compete with WoT but it's acceptable and getting better with every update(placebo maybe?)

Yes you can say it's a pay to win game since I can earn much more credits by playing tanks that are purchased with golds. Credits earned from those tanks can drastically accelerate your progress in techtrees. But honestly speaking, WoT and War thunder belong to that category as well. Either you spend a lot of time grinding for some particular tanks at certain levels that you're fond of, or you purchase in-game currency and speed up the process. The golds are on discount from time to time. So I'm pretty satisfied with it. 

I do hope WG can provide an exclusive HD graphics pack for PC players. The cooling fans of my gaming laptop never speed up when playing WOTB(i7-9750h+RTX 2080 max q)There're so much headroom that WOTB can squeeze out of average gaming laptop specs.

Edit(4/29/2020): 
Developers have justed added Girls und Panzer tanks in ALL SERVERS. Yes, you can buy Pz IV Ausf H, Tiger I & Hetzer that're originated from GuP TV animation. I really appreciate this decision cuz these tanks have been exclusive in Asia server for more than 4 years due to copyright reasons. Now not only can you purchase the collection in EU server(Russian server as well I guess), but two more tanks(IS-2 and Firefly) from the anime have been added to WOTB. Thx WG for showing the players and fans that you still care a lot about this project that you're in collaboration with after all these years."

9432,One of the best online cell phone games
9433,I love this game there is just a few problems with it. Chat is really bad like really the language is so bad sometimes that my parents wont let me play it anymore and i'm mad about it i think if WG could control the language i would be able to play one of the very few games i love!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh and match making sucks its got alot better but still bad i think that players who have been playing along time should get the really good crates i have 1500 battles and have only ever got a T-25 in a box. and player who have at least 800 battles should be able to buy stuff in store like spend money in store so if they have 800 battles they can spend real money that's it and the matchmaking and the chat i really wish WG would get their act together and do something about the language!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ANY ONE CAN PUT A BAD WORD IN BY DOING THIS LIKE EXAMPLE        DA NG OH AND IF YOU SAY PLZZZZZZ IT WILL BLOCK IT OUT AS A BAD WORD AND THEIRS MY RANT PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9434,ADDICTIVE GAME!
9435,"I started playing this on my phone and after a few years and a few teir VIII later, i finally played on pc and its definitely the best way to exprience, you could of course play actual world of tanks but this is a nice discount version, and even though there is so much in app purchases, you can still do well through the grind, which is arguably more fun anyways."

9443,"这个游戏之前就在手机上玩过很久，说实话，这个游戏：
1. 玩家群体素质低，经常有很多骂人的暴躁老哥，很多玩家根本不听劝，非要做孤儿单走，这也就体现出这个游戏玩家整体弱智化严重。但游戏中还是能遇到友好的，乐于交流的玩家，但他们还是会被低素质玩家淹没。
2. 想要变强吗？充钱吧！游戏中载具极端不平衡，金币车，金币弹，给了充钱玩家极大的优势，还有各种活动，各种降价什么乱七八糟的，也都是骗钱的（虽说套路都是中国公司早就用惯的伎俩）。
我现在也就在手机上玩玩，图个乐，不会认真的去打。如果真的想玩类似的游戏，还是玩战争雷霆吧。
I've been playing this game on my phone for a long time, and to be honest, this game:
1. toxic players are often seen in the game, and some of them are really angry, and many players simply don't listen, they just have to go alone, so the overall player IQ is low. of course, there are friendly, cooperative players, and a lot of them. but most of the time they are overwhelmed by those assholes.
2.PAY TO WIN ， vehicle are not balanced AT ALL, those paid vehicles are simply too strong(premium vehicles in war thunder are special, but not too strong), and all those ""operations"", are just another reason for you to put money in it(although these are tricks used by Chinese companies a long time ago)
currently, I play this on my phone for some fun, I won't play it seriously, if i want to ply seriously, i would play war thunder.

P.S. i copied this but it's so real, so i'll put it here

9446,Nice game :)))
9447,"This game in no way is fair to any one person playing it. You have to understand that if this game wants you to lose ,you will in fact lose. Same for winning. Very fun game with no doubt. An i mean if the game gave me a 10% Win rate i would still play it. But still, Sometimes in this more than not. You will shoot others with your shell disappearing into the nothing.You won't be able to damage others,If you do it is for minimal damage an not a kill.( Please if you see any different than I do please do indulge us.)"
9448,If you play this make sure you at least 4hr to kill. This game will suck you in.
9449,yes
9450,"Easy to learn, hard to master, always upgrading, endless replay value!"
9451,gud butt kinda bad
9452,"damn micro transaction, even they put the trap in ""cancel"" to autorize !!!! damn it !!!!"
9453,I do not recommend this game. It's full of brainless bots that will do nothing while the enemy captures the point. Warthunder has better in-depth gameplay than this game will ever have.
9454,"This game is absolutely nuts!!! I *feel* like I'm in a tank battle fighting for my country, independence, and supremacy. It is awesome."
9455,lots of fun
9456,It's pretty good.
9457,Play the original. Blitz should only be played for mobile gaming.
9458,Including the mobile game I have played this game for countless hours since 2014. I hate it.
9459,"Been playing this since the beta, still playing to this day. If you can get past the usual annoyances of mobile-style games (*cough* shit crates) the game is actually incredibly enjoyable. I prefer this over the PC WoT, having started in 2013. If you ever want to chat or just want some general banter or even some tips if you're new then feel free to add me."

9465,not bad
9466,"It is a good game, no doubt in that. However, the game forces you to grind it in order to further upgrade to newer tiers. The compulsory research modules to get to new tier tanks is pointless and eventually many would just give up. There are also some of aspects in the game that are ignored by the developers, if integrated, would make the game more interesting. One of these aspects is simply the guns aside from the main canon on the tanks. These guns in this game are only aesthetics, but have a lot more purpose and potential if given the opportunity to the players to use them too. 
In fact, the game gets shadowed a lot by War Thunder which I personally find more interesting to play due to the overlap of tanks, planes and ships in War Thunder and more realistic game play in War Thunder.
Overall, World of Tanks is a good game, fun and interesting to play, but it does need more work to be done."
9467,great game would highly recommend it
9468,good but sometimes shitty af
9469,its alright
9470,I love this game have played it on mobile and played the actually WOT on Xbox and PS4 just now kinda upset that i can't play this on Linux hopefully in the future they can maybe have it run on Linux! It probably won't though since the lack of Linux Players but i can only hope! :D

9477,For all low-spec PC players who like tanks this is the game you should play.
9478,"I actually have been playing the original (non-blitz) PC version for the past 8 years on and off. 
To compare this version has much less content, whether that be from the tanks the simplification of crews or maps, however this is why I prefer this version, for one it's 7v7 instead of 15v15 which makes the games much faster and that also means you can have more impact as just one player.

Overall I feel like this game is more fast pace and much less frustrating because there is no artillery, I recommend any fan of the original WoT PC version to give this a try as it reignited my passion for this series."

9494,I'M GOING TO PUKE. THE ONE THING THAT MADE THIS GAME UNIQUE TO ANY OTHER TANK GAME. ARTILLERY. AND YOU RETARDS REMOVED IT.
9495,"Just need some learning
its great

Edit:
Okay okay,,
Let me see, in this time which i didnt focus too much on an specific lineup, 
I did get mostly on tier 7, less on tier8, and around 5 6 tier 9 and two fully equipped tier10s, 
Game itself isnt that bad actually i dont expect more from a mobile game ported, and i think the graphics for the pc users should be changed , i mean more details, you know,,,
Mobile user experience is uhh okay i dont like playing with phone but its not that bad i think u should ask from a player, i just paid 4 or less dollars on an event tank which isnt that great but i liked that cuz of the anime i watched... Some paid tanks are still op in its tier but theres more to discuss,
The servers in my region sucks, both in mobile or in pc, both sucks, my ping in normal european games is around 100 but this game is around 220 most of the time, more than this and this gets better with packet loss, still in this situation i played 720 hrs and its just because i liked it, and im at 49.75% atm,..
I think its hard to achieve a good WR with this network issues.
The community, depends on the person, on european region which i play ,PLS TELL RUSSIANS THAT THERES NO REASON THAT EVERYONE HAVE TO BE KNOWLEDGEABLE TO WHAT THEY SAY IN CAPS AND THEY DONT GIVE UP WHEN U SAY I DONT know russian, so
Anyway, if u dont care about that so u must be fine in this game, theres too much to learn and lot of RNG needed for winning 

Ah man i wrote toomuch
This was my experience for this much time spent
Hope u understand it
<3 Much love, stay safe"

9498,The Graphics are insane
9499,"I have over 2000 hours on this game, on PC, phone and tablet. I've been playing this since December 2014, and I have to say, it's utter s**t. I don't even know where to start. The gameplay is dodgy at best, you could get killed by a shot that went through an obstacle or get hit in the most insignificant part of your tank (e.g. cupola) and lose like half your hp. The tech trees suffer constant changes, there used to be lots of tier 2, 3 and 4 tanks, but now they removed it to 1 per tier, in order to help new players, even though some of the tanks they removed (SU-18, AT-1, M3 Lee, T18 etc) simply made the game so much more fun. Everything Wargaming does is to help new players, some of them even get a Löwe in a crate after playing like 4 battles, it's crazy. Nothing gets done for the people that have played this game for years, we get f**k all, except maybe a badge or, if we're lucky, 25 gold. And finally, le pièce de résistance, the community. My God, it's so s**t you cannot imagine. If you think Rust and CS:GO are bad, you don't want to see how much of a piece of s**t this is. You can't go for 5 battles straight without being called a noob by someone, being reported for 'provocative communication' because you told an Italian 12 year old kid with 41% win rate that they need to move because they're blocking your vision, having at least one afk player on your team or being hit by an enemy player that was sitting behind a building. The game is scattered with kids playing on their dad's tablet, calling people noobs (I know, they still use that word) and reporting you to Wargaming and getting banned for 24 hours from chatting. If you do choose to risk your mental health and play this dreadful piece of horses**t, at least avoid using the chat. Finding someone capable of not insulting others is as rare as hen's teeth.
To conclude, I would not recommend this game to my worst enemy. If you don't want your veins to explode because of the stress this game will generate, please, for the love of God, stay away from this monstrosity, or at least free up 20gb of space and get the real World of Tanks, because this isn't worth your time, your effort and especially not worth your money.

9505,"This game is quiet fun! It is a very basic game that most computers can run, you don't need a high power gaming PC to play. I like the idea of game play along with the tanks you can play."
9506,I love this game and its new features for example the sheridan tanks with the rokets but i would also like you to give rentls out for 1 week premium tanks e.g. T28 Defender (my favourite tank) I think that would be great and would make more people to play WoT Blitz.

9508,"Great game, but be prepared to buy in-game, not really playable without that little bit of gold {and cash, and XP] to smooth things along. The game is free to download and play and some of the specials are great, but it will cost u in the long run...

 Pros:
+ simple but full of fun gameplay
+ short but full of action sessions
+ smoothly works on ancient laptops
+ great way to spend a pair of hours with an old friend durind covid-19 quarantine
+ bzzz goes the TANK!!!

Cons:
- Quite monotonous gameplay, you'll never play this game for a whole day

9531,So after i got something like 5 to 10 times my browser to popup to your game publicity campaign i finally decided to give it a try. So after i played less than an hour i felt like there is no sense of progression and that the game will get repetitive quite soon which is not fun and most likely is just a waste of time. So where do i start tank controls are bad actually very bad and i mean acceleration deceleration not forgetting to mention the grip and climbing uphill. The armor/hp of tanks fells kind of childish implemented more for a casual player than a pro one which wants realism like it's in War Thunder. Now i fell like i am wasting more time writing this and i could make a 2 pages list with everithing which i noticed that is bad in your game so i will stop here unninstall and add your website to my windows hosts file and hope i will never ever get there again .

I mean you might lose 16 times in a row... Or never get past tier 6-7


STILL BUY IT CUZ IT'S FREE"
9543,"if you like shooting with tanks then this is a game for you starting might be a bit grinding and the waiting time is going to be long but it worth the wait simply put it a game that needs teamwork, luck and time since there isn't really much of help buying gold tanks or gold cause doesn't help much but speed up the pace i didn't buy anything and yet i am still enjoying the game but sometimes the match making is a bit on your bad side putting you in a position where you have to face enemy tanks far stronger then yours but its about the skills and maybe the tank as well but stick with your team if you're lower rank and you might even be MVP even if you're lower rank then your team cause i know sometimes my team are bad and i ended up the 1st on my team by damage, exp, kills."
9544,it is a great game and i really like it
9545,It's meh you have to carry most of the team and it's some moments were P2W really shows itself off with gold and premium tanks not a fan about it

- Your shells are literally useless against +1 tier Tanks.

One word: CANCER!!!

9576,Not bad
9577,Good for low end gamers
9578,cheating is encouraged by the developers. Rudimentary cheats are blatant and rampant.
9579,Really Good Game. Test Your strategies
9580,great game
9581,"Fun game for a Girls und Panzer fan.
I used to play this game a lot on my phone."
9582,"This game is very fun to play as it involves fighting, battling and upgrading. The new feature, 'Gravity Force' allows this game to become a gigantic brawl which is madness! The only frustrating thing about the game is that it's always trying to sell you something, and it takes a long time to load a game. Anyway, this is expected as it's a free game."

9587,yes
9588,Great game
9589,Played a bit of it. Love it more than World of Tanks. WG should take notes from this game. The Match Making is much better on this game.
9590,"I've been a serious player of this game since 2018 on my mobile and a more casual player in 2017, just recently transferred over to the pc. As of writing this review I have roughly 50 hours on record. At one point this game was one of my favourites, but now I avoid it like a coughing Chinese person in the middle of the Wuhan wet market. The game is so over-saturated with over-powered pay to win fantasy tanks that there really isn't a point on playing with historical vehicles. I could tolerate that for the sake of fun, even if you really can't compete, anyone that says otherwise is in denial or has bought one, i could tolerate all that if it wasn't for the community. Not only is balancing non-existent, but the community is so toxic that putting a toothpick under your little toe and while hammering it in with a sledgehammer will give you more pleasure and enjoyment. I haven't payed a single penny on this game, and I would give me from the past a free blowjob and a pat on the back for not giving these greedy developers a single dime. Save yourself the trouble."
9591,yes
9592,great game esspecialy on mobile compared to any other game
9593,mmmm this game not true tank game tanks armors not true matchmaking so bad i think warthunder bether than this and this game is pay too win and full of noobs
9594,good
9595,befor you play this game you need to burn your money right away!
9596,"Rage inducing anger, after 1,3k+ hours of this game you WILL develop anger issues, it's a guarantee."
9597,"GOOD GAME

"
9598,Bros this gem is really good for its optimalization compared to the regular wot it dosent require much out of your pc but there is one thing the game changed a lot and there is a lot of tanks being removed which is a minus for this game if there would be more tanks this game would be like regular wot but lower specs edition
9599,its beeter then war thunder if you have a bad PC. But if you have a good PC go play WAR THUNDER
9600,its pretty great just play it
9601,crazy events are best thing here to do stupid fun stuff with tanks otherwise its quite normal
9602,good game play.  PC and mobile.
9603,"unrealistic speeds, reload times, and damage. Plus there are only 2 maps, either a desert or a castle that's it. I entered with high expectations left with only disappointment."
9604,i like this games
9605,"Very fun
"
9606,"Hello players ive been playing this game for a little more than a yer now and i had a great experience . the matches  are fun and dont take long to start, its one of hte best tank games ive played so far."
9607,"The all of game is wery ok,"
9608,what a werid gjdif
9609,Definitely more fun than Wot and War Thunder
9610,"idk what i suppose to say but its good
"
9611,it is a good game and fun too
9612,"I love this game soo much,this game its soo good!"
9613,"The game itself is alright, but the player base is complete and utter garbage. Avoid this game if you want to spare your brain cells and time. Any game where you're able to buy yourself up to the highest level with minimal to no effort definitely has its issues, and that's where the issues from this game stem from; players being underqualified for the level they're playing at. Not to mention loot boxes and the OP tanks that come from them."
9614,"First things first. This is game that was dumb downed from it's PC origins and ported to mobile gaming. Let's just set that aside, because it isn't a downside to the game. It actually sort of benefits it, but more on that later.

World of Tanks Blitz as it is now, is pretty much WoT PC as of 2014 (with bits and pieces of later iterations thrown in there). This is important when it comes to it's tank tech trees. Did you like the FV215B 183? Well it's still here. Derp to your hearts content. Do you like the new(ish) German Heavy branch ending with the VK72.01(K), it's in here too. They just introduced the heavy Japanese Tank Destroyers. BUT the most important aspect of Blitz that we can all appreciate? No Artillery. No more being zapped from across the map by what feels like pin point accurate tactical strikes. Blitz has smaller maps, resulting in quick brutal rounds that dont drag on because a super heavy tank is chasing a light tank up a giant hill or across the map.

Another great thing is that you carry your account across all devices. I usually play this game on my phone or on my tablet. But if I want to sit down and play with keyboard and mouse, I can hit up my PC and continue on the tanks I was working on.








The Tiger (P) still sucks in this game though, sorry."
9615,its good
9616,I had doubts now it's a favorite
9617,nice Game to play if you like grinding
9618,great

9621,"It is a fun game and the devs keep trying to make it fun. At the moment, there is a moon event with  low gravity, so tanks go flying through the air and get pushed around."
9622,"Very entertaining, we can build up our tanks and use each one against players on maps having only tanks of the same level, leaving the wins to the tactics each player employs.

Upgrading our tanks and their skills, even without spending money is relatively easy, we just need to win battles and/or performing the daily tasks.

Essentially, we can have fun without spending money.

LeZuul recommends!"
9623,"A great game! My computer's too slow to play World Of Tanks, but World Of Tanks Blitz is great!!!!

Still, I recommend dis game -w-"

9636,Good game but takes thousands of hours to get good and get good tanks. Not pay to win but you can pay to advance to more tanks faster which I think is fair. I like it. Developers don't listen sometimes but meh.

9645,I like the graphics and the game play.  It is a quick game that allows you to research and develop your tanks without spending a penny.
9646,started playing WoT on console when it first came out and once you there was no more people playing on console i switched over to this and i loved it only 50 hours and i have more progress then probably what i had on console by the first 100 hours

9651,"A long time ago, I uesd to listen to the 'Everybody tanks now ' and played this game.
    Now it seems to be everybody noobs now.
    It has become a noob game with a noob matching system.

(New edit at 02/06/2020)
    Now I finally realized that why I think this game is special. This is a game that will match some low win rate players to you to try to let you lose instead of match more high win rate players. That's why I won't recommend it because there is no pleasure to play with dumb teammates and pro enemies.
    By the way, more and more powerful gold tanks makes this game very nice because it turned this game into a P2W game successfully. Actually I love this game, really. But now I would like to tell everybody around me to stop costing money in this game. I'm tired of all this sh it."
9652,"fun
"
9653,it very  fun
9654,"Great game overall, has some issues regarding playerbase but thats about it. Fairly easy to learn, but hard to master. cross platform game with mobile, pc, and nintendo switch. 9/10"
9655,By Far the Best Tank Game Ever
9656,"Each update this game keeps tanking(pun intended)it gets worse each update, very very bad matchmaking, glitchy and buggy, ghost tanks, on target shots do no damage or bounce they just dissapear, really really bad players over run the game being idiots, if you want frustration and never ending misery  then go ahead and download it!!
also premiums don't belong in regular tier battles that is total BS. war gaming caters to money which is BS
FREE TO PLAY,  PAY TO WIN even when you pay you still get bad bad teams and players. This game is slowly going down, good players leaving daily to find better games. Sad but true!!"
9657,"all of games im alone and last i got a zero point in game 
no help no dmg no supp"
9658,gg
9659,"A very enjoyable game to play especially with a friend! a much more easily accessible version of the game if you can't always be home to play on console or standard PC edition. The MM is about what you'd expect from a WoT game, but, this version possesses things that neither PC nor console have, like (for example) Japanese TDs and ATGM launchers, at least at this point in time they're exclusively here. 

Bottom line, if you love WoT and want to have to ability to play it anywhere or even from your PC with friends who may not be able to play the alternative versions, this is a MUST HAVE. -Reaper"

9668,"Far too pay to win for my liking and the recent addition of loot crates that have a chance of dropping tier 10 tanks for whoever throws enough money at the screen is incredibly bad. If you want a balanced approach and just a far more enjoyable game that isn't blatantly pay to win, this is Not the game for you."

9691,"I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys MMO's and has an interest for tanks. But all these games are the same, they are all pay to win. This can get annoying when you have been playing for five years and still have not reached tier 9 yet. This aside, this is a very enjoyable game and i have played this game for hours without getting bored or tired or the game. So to anyone thinking of getting this game, make sure to have some spare money in your wallet, becuase in the end you will buy items for this game."
9692,This is  mobile/android version of game albeit takes too much space in your HDD. Graphics silly gameplay silly. Short story Stay away. Nothing like World of Tanks.

9706,"The lag of 1000+ that is constant throughout the game is mind blowing.

The game looks fun, could be fun, but if you want to seal club mobile players good luck. The lag really breaks this game. Totally unplayable.

I'm using a ryzen 7 3700X, 34gb 2400, and a Radeon RX 5700X it's not my system. I have a ping in regular world of tanks of 50 on the NA server it's not my internet. There is something fundamentally flawed about this game.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
9707,I have played all the WWll World of War games through their website for years now and just recently they have all started kicking me off the server in the middle my games and when I reconnect I have crashed my plane or been killed. In the Word of Warships you get penalized for leaving a game early and your ship shows up to the other players as pink meaning you have made a in game infraction. Once fixed this is a great game and then I will once again recommend !

9713,I love this game. It is very fun and kills alot of time. WOTB was and still is fun but it is slowly dying. WG the developers are slowly ruining the game. An example of this is they are removing tanks from the game and sellijng them for money.

Or just fork over the irl money and buy it. I wouldn't have minded a grind, but they make it so ridiculous in order to tempt you to just pay them for the content."

"
9823,"First of all, I'd name this game ""Fast and Furious : Tank Warfare"". 
Now that we have figured out the most important aspect of the game, we can started.
This game is basically World of Tanks little brother, with a higher density of tanks, easier controls, and maps that seem to be smaller than in the original game. I haven't played so much of the original game to say that I know the tank structures and upgrades, but I think Blitz has a simplified structure compared to that. The graphics are awesome, considering the fact that the game has little over 2GB, and it can be played on a potato PC with 60fps, which is great. 
Another great fact about the game is that it has a lot of tanks and upgrade for tanks, so you won't get bored exploring those. Also, you can easily get tier 4 or 5 tanks without having to play a lot, but after tier 5 you need to spend more time playing a single tank to get upgrade stars for it. Although, the maps are quite repetitive so if you're not a great tactician you might tend to get bored or annoyed by that. I've only reached tier 6 on a tank as we speak so I can't say that I'm that great at the game, my matches are more like random people doing random stuff, not really having so much of a tactic whatsoever, but if you reach higher tiers you probably experience a more tactical version of the game.
The game is free to play, but you can buy in-game stuff with real currency (like in every game nowadays) and even tanks, which give you an easier approach to the game I suppose, but I won't consider it pay-to-win.
Overall, the game is good if you wanna waste a couple of hours from time to time, but I won't see myself playing this game on a daily basis, unless I'm pretty bored. To be honest, the game is better than a lot of paid ones, so why not give it a shot?"

9837,YES
9838,good tanks good gameplay
9839,"I've been playing for 3 days now, so far it's great you just need some time and probably money to upgrade or buy tanks faster. It's not really a pay to win kind of game it's more like a pay to buy and upgrade your tanks faster, you know if you want to have an easier life you should probably spend some $$$"
9840,"топ игра

9841,k
9842,"FTP, can feel PTW with the gold for better ammo thing, still a model designed to sucker kids and addicts, but a good game."
9843,i just love shooting people
9844,"love this game, there are a few things that can be improved.One can be better HD graphics or graphics overall and second can be adding more game mode as normal and rating just is not enough. but other than that this is a great game."
9845,"Full of action!
"
9846,"I have played this game from 2016 if I remember correctly. There are many pros and cons to this game.

Cons:
-So much pay to win, normal players dont make much credits or XP on free accounts nowadays so getting to tier X is a long journey
-Anime tanks (?) Nameless, Edelweiss etc
-Boosters are not common for a regular player and without them, it can be hard to reach higher tiers after tier 7
-The UI is somewhat messy
-You cant swear during a match, the game once even censored the word ""youd""
-Selling tanks only gives you a fraction of the price you payed
-The equipment (rammers, binoculars etc) are expensive as hell
-Crew training is very slow
-Missiles in the game with fast light tanks, you can prolly see why that is wrong

Pros:
-Game is free
-Matches are quick
-If youre willing to pay, the game is fun
-You can have this game for a bad pc or a phone
-Generally it is fun

I would rate this game 6 or 7 out of 10. It has a lot to improve but it has some nice qualities to it"

9857,before this game was a funny and great game but now it just a p2w game and thats sucks
9858,Pure fun... so many ways to play with all the different tanks & types.
9859,"Its fun, find your play style and find tanks that play to your strength. Learn on Tier 1-3, and then move up to classical WW2 tanks and beyond.  2-5min of derpy carnage."

9867,"[h1]Review[/h1] 
This game is basically just a pc port which is originally a mobile port. So they ported a mobile game back again to pc despite the original game was made for the pc. Its a confusing mess as i tought it was just a re-release of the game with a tag on, similliar how some mmos re-release again under a new tag or catchphrase.

[u]Gameplay[/u]
The blitz version is very barebones, its a tank game with barely any tactics. If you want a similliar experience just play any ps1 era tank game, they are as deep as this one. You cant aim really specific parts of a tank or be able to kill people inside a tank. Its very arcade, and in a very boring bad way as you are used to the more complex and somewhat more fun version of the game. 

Later on the grind seems to become very steep, people complain spending over hundreds of dollars and still have problems grinding endgame tanks.

[u]Graphics[/u]
Its mobile graphics on a pc, similliar from stuff you see in early ps2 era. Maps are pretty small and not very demanding.

 [u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]
I dont see any reason to touch this game, just play the real version instead.

2/10 Bad game"
9868,love the game
9869,Great game to play
9870,"blitz is best gdt dmn ""steam"" off game ever (i havent played ca 15y at all, last was Panzer General II & half-life (btw HL is best effing FPS ever!) so, what do u waiting 4? roll up ur sleeves and be part of the team!!! knock your socks off!!!

9901,Great game!
9902,"The Game is Fun, Easy, Interesting, and most of all Intense."
9903,i would recomend this game to other because of problems of balance between teams.. if u are playing in platoon u get platoon in other team aswell and many times they have 5 or 7% higher win rate as a player.... so if i got 55% they have 60+% is that good balance??? NO!!!

9931,good
9932,"Is it p2w? It's yes and a no, covid19 got us indoors and playing games and this is quite entertaining. The levelling system gets you hooked into splashing cash unless spending hours of grind for higher tier tank that yo need to deck out for full playability and the expense soon escalates around tier 6-7 (each nation category of tank has 10 tiers). The german leopard at tier V just rips people to shreds while the brit sherman firefly at tier VI is awesome with speed and reload speed. I spent about 5 euros for some gold and its now gone at this point but is it really worth playing it at tier 10? I have my doubts.

Having said that it is FUN and enjoyable while it lasts.

*note* free 14 day premium membership so its worth a shot for the early stages."
9933,good
9934,its good

9936,Fun fast game
9937,"The graphics are great, community is great and overall the game is super fun"
9938,"This game is designed to be pay-to-win. Gold, or rare loot crate tanks gives players so much more advantage that even shit players can easy take out better players. Gold rounds gives p2w players so much more advantage than normal players, even though they said it can be bought without cash. Gold also allow you to spam consumables that adds considerable advantage in game.

Pay2win through and through."

9944,It provides a good catharsis at the end of the day (or any time that you can fit it in).  Upgrades that you buy should be made after you have a little bit of experience with the game.   As a WWII buff I can tell just how much effort went and continues to go into the accuracy of the game without having it become ridiculously or unplayably realistic.

9965,"More than just a lite version of WOT, Blitz carves out a spot all it's own with a gamemode and tank selection that demands a different approach to the ones taken in WOT. Blitz manages to bring together fresh quick action packed matches and classic WOT theory. Get yer peeks and wiggles in 10/10"
9966,Fun game great variety of tanks ... Lots of great communities to join through discord.
9967,I have perfectly fine internet connection but this games servers are so bad that i literally can't play it.
9968,"Good game, lots of action. Helps take the mind off of COVID 19."
9969,"World of Warships was fun, but the pacing and combat was a bit lackluster. World Of Tanks: Blitz hits the right combination of fast action, strategy, physics, geometry. With varied terrain and team tactics typically allowing even the most seemingly one sided conflict to be turned around with a couple deflects and some well timed armor pentrating rounds to the back side of your foes. Love the World Of franchise and these ladies and gents can shut up and take my $$$!"

9975,"good smaller version of WOT, glad it`s free - the controller support through steam is very much appreciated as well"
9976,It's a good game
9977,"Very fun and easy to get in to! Not as realistic as the other giant of the tank gaming world, Warthunder, meaning more ""what, that should've killed him!"" moments, but WoT can definitely be a lot of fun at times! From my experience, matches are shorter, loading each match takes less time, and there are more than enough vehicles to entertain yourself with! Most importantly, however, the grind isn't nearly as arduous as WT's. If we are being honest here, I would (and did ^w^) get both games. WT is more strategic and can really get your adrenaline rushing, but if you just want to lay back and blast some tanks, WoT fills that role quite well!"
9978,i love tanks
9979,The game is way too grindy and all of the pay to win features such as premium cost way too much and the preium tanks the game is cool but i overall do not recommend
9980,Fun
9981,"It's very nice light tank game, if don't have lots of space, you should check out WOT Blitz. It's fast paced and fun."

There are problems that ruin and bug the gameplay: bugs, glitches, hackers, pay to win tanks (premium tanks) and high tier, low tier battle, toxicity of some players that bypass the chat filter and RNG. I'd like that to be fixed as soon as possible because many people complained about it. The game is just simulating the tank and battling like in real life.

10053,"TL:DR: Money = premium = progress = everything else

World of Tanks Blitz is a great game. Progression is a bit grindy, but fun to play and learn. All tanks moving up have unique, necessary playstyles that shape the game in an interesting way. There are many cool tanks to work towards from many countries. The game from a normal standpoint is fun and something other games do not offer

My problems are the way premium works, premium tanks work, and how gold-dependent the progress is. You can either have fun and progress the way the game is supposed to, or you can go down the pay-to-play path. The pay-to-play path is quite lazy. You buy a premium tank using gold (which costs real money), and already you pretty much have infinite silver. Premium tanks also generate lots of XP, which can be turned into free XP using more gold, then from there, you can research any tank in the game. While you master how exactly to play your premium tank and destroy players who don't want to sink money into the game, you get sweet XP and silver to go with it. Just keep paying Wargaming and you have any tank in the game. 
There's also the events, and dear god, they want you to spend money on that stuff. On the profile I use for my phone, I grinded about 5 hours a day for about 2 weeks during an event, and I got a mediocre tank out of it. Alternatively, you can skip right to the end and grab the good loot with gold. 
There's also the free loot boxes. After like 1 straight year of opening them on my phone, I got a really mediocre premium tank which was still better than the equivalent non-premium of the same tier.
Let's not forget regular premium itself. You can pay Wargaming tons of money in what's essentially a subscription for a whole 50% boost in XP and silver. It costs 1 dollar per day, or you can splurge $50 on a whole year, with varying options in between.
If you want to play without sinking money into it, it's a pain in the rear to get past tier 6 with how many premium tanks and 2-hitters there are

Personally I don't recommend the game specifically because of the premium features. It's great in every other aspect. Gameplay is fast, tanks are reasonable (most of them, in both price and performance), decent amount of maps, Easter Eggs, differing playstyles, etc. It's just too bad Wargaming had to ruin a good chunk of it. I come back to it time and time again, but it never changes."
10054,"I've been playing WoT PC for 10+ years and Blitz is very refreshing from the PC and its fairly well balanced. the tech tree research costs are A LOT slower and expensive  then the PC version but the grind doesn't feel that long or hard. 7vs7 is great  and ive noticed the queue is way faster.
Its like playing WoT PC way back, even before the game had physics lol 
I like how its kind of ""arcady"" but thats what makes it kind of funner then PC since WoT PC went way off left field last few years. 
All in all i give it a strong 8/10 for a fairly well balanced, good match making fun tank game."
10055,"the game it self is great there is tons of hideouts for the tanks and tons of danger zones and i find that a big advantage

10065,"This is basically a situation where the game is really fun but the devs suck.  Competetive gameplay, intense and fun, but also can get frustrating because of the broken matchmaking and excessive premium tanks (P2W) being introduced on a weekly basis.  And let me tell you what, matchmaking is really BROKEN.  I do recommend this game, as it is super fun, but with a warning.  Don't expect the devs to be great or new content, the community can be really toxic at times, and matchmaking is currently totally non-functioning.  If those things were solved, this would be an excellent game.  For now, it's just a ""good game"""

10076,good game try it
10077,"before this game was a funny and great game but now it just a p2w game and thats sucks
cause the players in this game is too small wargaming add some idiot AI in your teammate to fill your team for a game you will see some people with 20k battle and avg damage in their game is 100!! just dont play this game and if you play this game dont spend money in this garbage"
10078,noice
10079,Great game -  10/10
10080,I did not enjoy this game.
10081,"This is easy.  If you have been playing then you are good.  If you are a new player then you a fucked.  You will be told it is new player friendly but if you do not understand the map layout or angles on those maps you will be destroyed.  Ignore the BS.  This game is about existing players destroying new players and nothing else.

Update 3-22-22.  Nothing has change still a steaming pile of crap for new players but it got worse.  Now you can be looking at a tank with nothing in between you and them in a town at close range and they will still disappear from your sight.  Like you see it and then all the sudden you don't....  total BS for new players, total garbage of a game."
10082,good but not as good as War Thunder
10083,it's fun
10084,"I'm having a great time. Usually I am in MMORPGs and sometimes FPS games. I did not think a tank game would be fun, but this is super. It takes into account strategy, planning, and accuracy in aim/firing. I understand (mostly) what is going on and the mechanics. I have a bit of trouble figuring out the flying mechanics. I do want to try some longer battles and will explore other games perhaps. But since I also like blitz chess, a blitz tank battle is not bad at all!"
10085,it is very historical and fun to play the only thing i dont like is that most of the time the game puts you in a round with other people but overall fun just make sure you remember your email
10086,"Fun, at the begining"
10087,"What's the point? I'm being matched against enemies with tanks of way higher tier than mine, I deal almost no damage to their armor."

10095,"Pretty Good , Not going to lie"
10096,"Fantastic game if you like progression.  Its better than the main game if you arent looking to spend more than 5 mins a match. Tanks are pretty balanced however some premium tanks outshine their tech tree counter-parts , as well as the odd tech tree tank being objectively better than others in its class. The class system makes each game feel different as there are so many tanks playing so many different roles. The game-play is overall interesting and challenging.

8.5/10 - Its free so its worth a try however it is a mobile app so they will try to sell you everything they can to get you to ""enhance"" your experience.

Overall"

10100,the lag has been terrible
10101,"Pay to win and toxic community with terrible matchmaking. I've wasted a lot of time on this game - playing for at least 5 years. The game seems to get worse every update. They focus the majority of their time, from my understanding, on making premium content. The premium tanks in this game are just flat out better than the free tanks. (Not only do they possess advantages in fighting, but they also produce more in-game currency) Wargaming has gotten ridiculously greedy and they are willing to sell new players tanks that play in games against veterans. Wargaming's greed and lack of care for balance has ruined the game. Don't waste your time!"

10126,My first game ever. Good choice to break the ice nad learn the controls
10127,cuốn vl
10128,Fun faced paced game but make sure that if your looking for the main version of world of tanks you go to wargaming's website as this is a mobile version of World of tanks.  Seen a lot of new players not understanding that this isn't the main PC game but rather a mobile port since this is the only version on steam.  still a decent experience
10129,"Match Making (MM) is bad and has been for as long as I've had this game. I've read up on the subject and watched numerous videos. I've also played and asked the same question in many other games and the problem is more prevalent in WOTB. This leads me to believe that it could be intentional. I keep coming and trying the game; hoping that it will be somewhat fixed but to no avail. I have been on both sides of win/lose fence and it feels a whole lot better to be on a 8 win 2 lose streak rather than the other way around. When I do lose I'm usually in top three for damage given so it's not my fault alone when we lose. I do make bonehead mistakes like anyone else but those are usually rare.  I know there are numerous variables to match making but I see too many games where my team will have 3 or 4 players with win rates around 40% vice opposing team with 3 or 4 or more players with over 50% win rates. The tanks, of both side, will be likely more even in rating than the players are. I'm pretty sure this is adjustable since the player base is there I believe.  Perhaps this could be an in game option to look for more even player rated games. I also know that the wait time for said games could be longer but that should be a choice that I make. 
NOTE:  You should be able to have squads of 3 in order to have more impact in the game outcome if the MM can't or won't be fixed anytime soon. Perhaps the option of using more than one tank in a game should be looked at as well.

There are other factors that could/should be looked at to make the game more playable. One of them is map size. I find the map size to be a little constricting. Should be expanded to allow for longer shots and manoeuvres. As a direct result of such map expansion the game timer would, most likely, have to increase; depending on the map layout of course. 

I'll leave my other thoughts to perhaps another review in the future.

But it's fairly balanced to be honest so it's still very enjoyable as a free to play.
Very good game overall"

10176,"*WARNING PAY TO WIN PAY TO WIN*

The game has taken a turn for the worst, its basically a requirement to pay now to get anywhere, DO NOT believe that you can play this game for free and actually get somewhere, there are very very clever techniques in play to sell you things by making it seem very cheap at first to get good stuff, however you will soon realise that £150 later you are still at the same point, and all you did was buy some stuff you thought would be great but turns out everyone has them, and your a farm for other players and bots.

DO NOT PLAY! DO NOT GET SUCKED IN! DO NOT SUPPORT THIS GAME! SUPPORT GAMES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE IN GAME PURCHASES!"
10177,too expensive
10178,i can't stop playing its so fun
10179,"its okay.
Especially fun in the beginning, and then, as the tanks become increasingly expensive and long to research, the game becomes very grindy -- tho, that's to be expected with free to plays.

10190,"This game is cross-platform and actually designed for the mobile phone space.  Adding it to the PC world and allowing to play with friends that only have phones is a huge win.  Also, if you have a limited system, this doesn't require a ""huge"" amount of system resources vs the full WOT game.  While there is the in game purchasing, it is fairly easy to avoid. However, if you are an impatient person, you could fork out tons of real world money to progress faster for bigger tanks."

TANKS BLITZ on your next update , make the maps bigger , don't have to be as big as War Thunder but that's definitively the step I would recommend for you. I would imagine all the rest of the aspect of BOTH GAMES could simply be done in the software. BIGGER MAPS BLITZ incoming from War Thunder other than that , both are freaking awesome , give em a try.

10219,"8.5/10 would recommend! Despite my account saying I've only played this game for a couple hours, I had it downloaded for the windows store for 2 years now (estimated 900+ hours in game). Very good game if u like a strategic game with amazing tanks to get! It offers many play styles from sniping, tanking shots, flanking around the enemy, and everything in between! However, with that being said, the community in battle can be very toxic at times, team competence and skill can vary from not knowing how to shoot to pros playing in unison and destroying other tanks. Also, although u can  kick some butt (with grace) without paying any money the game can sometimes be pay to win."
10220,Fun simple game. Easy to pick up hard to master.
10221,"Fun and strategic, a lot of grinding needed when it comes to upgrading tank tiers."
10222,"Great game, nicely made. The only thing I would like to say is that the events in the game forces to to play 20 hours a day on the game to complete them."
10223,no
10224,A great game with great detail to the tanks and amazing game play
10225,"Nice game, she opened me world realy WoT and she longer in verified"
10226,its a real good stratagy game i love it!
10227,"I can't really say it's a free to play game, as much as i'd love to.. You simply cannot play the game without spending at least 100$ on the game. Even that's a lowball for any player. If the prices were to change and be lowered for the amount you get from spending, via credits - gold - dollar it'd be worth spending the couple bucks. There's many things in the game I wouldn't be able to accomplish without spending money.. It's actually terrible. That being said, the servers lately have been disconnecting me a lot.. The MM system is severely mixed to where the team with more paid tanks actually destroy the other team. I wish there were an option to allow more people in a platoon. I can't play with my whole clan unless it's in a practice. And those are pointless! I want to be able to play with my clan members in battles against other clans in ranked or regular. Or just play with friends that I choose, instead of me and a friend play with randoms who don't speak my language. It's very frustrating that we have all these clans, and cannot fight regular or rank battles with them. This should change. I love the game, just needs to change a lot to be as good as it should be."
10228,Veery Nice Game :D
10229,"Good game, good tanks, but some items cost too much gold and some events are hard, other than that I like the game."
10230,"It's a coop game to kill or get killed, when you are alone you are doomed, it's imposible to fight against others tanks alone if they go together. In lower tiers tanks there is much fun, the damage are low so you can play a little more, in the hightest tiers with 3-4 shots you lost. There are games that the enemy are all premium tanks, if you play without pay you feel like a sitting duck. To get the top tier tanks you have to spend so many battles but it's a game that if the teams are balanced you get so much fun. If you don't game for a long time your reputation go down. Avatars thing is only to elevate your ego, I think it's useless. To play it in the mobile you have to get a game command, like the console command but to the mobile, touching the screen it's not good. I recomemded this game."
10231,good game
10232,"same as World of Tanks, maps are smaller so the action is faster paced."
10233,Tis game is really fun!
10234,More fun when I win.
10235,Great Game
10236,Indeed a badass game.
10237,"One of the game that you can survive even without spending a lot of cash(Just gaming knowledge,skills and common sense) and the customer support is mush decent than other games I just really hope that their event is much more f2p friendly because its WAY IMPOSSIBLE for a human to finish this event without pouring some money on it(well you can but only if you could play everyday for the remaining days of a specific event)"
10238,"I've been playing this game for at least 5 years. First on mobile, and then on PC as well, since its release on steam and the windows store. Not as detailed, expansive, or pretty as the full WOT game exclusive to PC, but in my opinion, does a great job nonetheless. It retains the RNG that the full PC games has with Armor and Gun stats, spotting and Camo mechanics, and does it in package that fits in your pocket to pull out for a quick match whenever and where ever. The addition of so many premium and collector tanks, separate from the tech-tree tanks that you work for and unlock through normal play has been, and always will be a controversial subject. You will probably end up spending at least SOME cash in the game to get ahead and stay competitive, but it is still not a requirement to enjoy this game."
10239,"Great game but very expensive deals in shop for a tank but considering it’s a free to play game I don’t mind their system of monitization and the grind for tanks is pretty fast considering the alpha game world of tanks on console and pc. 
"
10240,its not bad < so much transactions but it is to be expected at least the play is solid
10241,This game is lit
10242,it starts crashing when i am on streak lose. I think the game is trying to tell that I should have a break before a smash my keyboard in to million pieces.
10243,I love the game got it when it came out!!
10244,DO EGGSA BRE
10245,"GREAT GAME
I enjoy the range of tanks in this game, and the occasional fictitious tank that will pop up in the store.  This is NOT. a pay-to-win game, though it seams like it sometimes.  Only game better than this is World of Tanks"
10246,"I've been playing World of Tanks for years on PC, Console, and Mobile its very fun when you play the game with Friends and solo if you enjoy being a lone wolf, or fight as a wolf pack, together"
10247,". WAY different than WOT, smaller maps mean ya get right to the action. 7vs 7 is perfect.gotta say its a great game .ive had my ups and downs with it but great has come out on top. really good for free to play players also because they have so many operations that result in a free tank. the action really starts at tier 5. pick you tech tree line carefully. this is where the suprise comes in. Clans!! find an active clan and you all set. althought some players are jerks ,most are really good ,friendly players out there. have fun and enjoy!!"
10248,"крутая игра

10249,Неплохо  в целом! Рекомендую!!
10250,"If you're favourite game is about salty people or trash team players, this game is absolutely wonderful for you. :)"
10251,This game is unpolished and is really badly made. Light tanks can shoot thru heavy but heavy tanks cant shoot thru other tanks. Try WarThunder for better tank feel because heavy tanks feel like big boxes which cant fight and light feel like sports cars with cannons on top. I though that bethesda has lots of bugs but this is unbelievable. I dont think this game doesnt have potencial but I would say that war thunder is harder to learn but it is in all ways better.
10252,"A most Stellar, mobile version of World of Tanks with almost every mechanic matched! Skill trees and crew abilities have been simplified, but the same 'meta' applies and a lot of clans carry over as well-BEST PART- Linking my phone account to the steam account let me grind wheneva!!! Well done devs!! wakaWAKA"
10253,played it on ios and i gotta say the ping is better on pc for me but i am experianced with how battles work ect.. with the game and i find it fun to play and enjoyable when the team does not let you down as even for experianced players like me we could lose most of the battles if the entire team goes only 1 way during a battle leaving a flank open being defended by 1 tank
10254,It is a nice war game with a big variety of tanks and much more...
10255,"its a great game to kill time, matches don't take very long and there's plenty of fun in all the tiers of tanks."
10256,"Very Solid Cross-Platform game, Servers are sometimes laggy (depends on how close you are to the servers). It takes time for you to grind to Tier X. It is mostly a pay to boost progression kind of game with some p2w tanks sprinkled in it"
10257,"Its a GOOD GOOD game , enjoy it dudes !"
10258,"its a decent game, takes forever to progress to anything useful.... when you hit tier 7 you can clan battle at which point you can actually enjoy the came... anything prior to that is just afk farming for money"
10259,"It is abolutely a game i masssively recommend if you love arcade like Tank battle video game, of course if your brain is all about MASSIVE REALISM war thunder is the best choice here, but my childhood tank game was WOTB so ill stay here until i probs die, anyways hope yall find this useful"
10260,If only it was like war thunder still kind of good.
10261,"Predetermined outcomes is the name of the day here.  Many big clans get preferential match making and Match Maker decides who wins generally speaking before a shot is ever fired.
It is a mix of predetermined losses and wins(with low percentage of actual even play) that ""make a fair play experience"" that Wargaming touts in its patent filed.  
I play because i like blowing up tanks and this has the right amount of action to make the fixed outcomes tolerable.
"
10262,I love this game!
10263,I played it well but I suffered lot of not responding during gameplay.
10264,Fun game
10265,wot u on about
10266,"Эту игру я могу посоветовать только тем, кто любит АНАЛЬНЫЙ СЕКС...
"
10267,Good game
10268,Its pretty good game.
10269,I LOVE THE TANKS
10270,"Nice game, i started playing then keep going longest with this game."
10271,"I've been playing this game for about 5 years and I don't really like the direction it is taking with guided missiles, crates with drop chances and events like the one that took place during christmass. One of the first events I participated in was IS-3 Defender event. It took a lot of time to finish, but it was fair, you could either spend some money on gold to finish the event, finish part of the event by playing and pay only part of it, or just simply play a lot to get the tank for free. Now there are crates which give you % chance of getting something and in the case of christmass event, crates which give you random number of currency to get to the tank, which in the end took hundereds to thousands of dollars to get. The game is getting worse with these business tactics and also with the new missile mechanic. Can't recommend anymore even tho I've met few friends through the game."
10272,"I""ve been playing this game for over a year on and off.  It's a fun game and well balanced.  Yes, you can spend $$ to get some slightly better tanks (Pay-to-Play), but overall it's well balanced and you can be very competitive without spending money.  They continue to expand and add content to the game on a very regular basis.  

The couple things that I wish they had or would change would be:
1. A way to play the game against AI only either solo or with a group of friends.  
2. To either platoon with more than 2 people or a way to have more than 2 people in a game on the same side."
10273,;)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
10274,"Is an awsome game overall but the matchmaking , oh boy , 1 team all over 50% win rate and the other team all under 45% wr. You need to make something about matchmaking based on the win rate. 1 good player can t always carry and that s frustrating. Changed 4 monitors by now..so let me tell you it is frustrating."
10275,good game
10276,nice game
10277,This is a great game.
10278,Рекомендую всем кто играл в World of Tanks.
10279,BBRilliant game
10280,just simple i love this game
10281,it is a great game i think is better then normal WOT
10282,"The balance of matchmaking is very bad, if you are a good player you have to carry 2 or more 0 to 100 dmg teammates every game, also the soviet tanks are also obviously favoured in design and balancing."
10283,the game is just fun brodeeh
10284, More victories!  I have not met the invincible ;)
10285,cool game
10286,Pretty cool game I like the fact that I can play it both on my phone and on steam
10287,"Это очень класная игруха всем советую
"
10288,"Игра хорошая, но цены на танков не обоснованная. Продавайте не нагибучие танки подешевле изначально. танки такие как Т-75TS и Chimera продавались очень дорого. Дайте людям возможность покатать какой либо танк перед покупкой, хотя бы на час что бы люди понимали за что они платят. Контейнеры с танками тоже плохо работают. Сделайте так что бы процент падения танка увеличивалась с каждым разом. что бы люди понимали что донатив максимум какую то сумму, они получат этот заветный танк. А счастливчикам может выпасть когда угодно. сделайте так что бы люди не сожалели за потраченные деньги. надеюсь что вы это прочтёте и сделайте сферу для донатеров благоприятнее."
10289,"This game is sooo damn good................ I mean, it has over a hundreds of historical tanks raging from 1930's to 1950's. Although yes, it's HP Mechanics are not realistic, but you don't need to look at realism. *if you do then please go to War Thunder* but seriously, this game is so awesome, recomended you to play this game"
10290,i like the game
10291,"Badly managed, very exploitative, and effectively uncreative game. Hours of frustration and not competitive game-play.  Most of the battles are meaningless. Rarely a sense of fun. 
The developer lures you in with the label of allegedly free play, and then manipulates the game (and your experience) in order to sell you tanks, without interested in improving gameplay and the players' knowledge/skills. 
New overpowered expensive tanks are constantly advertised as a promise for wins. Older tanks become obsolete and what you've already spent, soon, has no much value.
Unskilled or chronically bad players are pushed by aggressive marketing to play with experienced/skilled players, even at the top tiers, creating a chaotic nonsense game-play most of the time. And so any chance for creativity and the necessary for the game teamwork is destroyed - sole aim is company profit.
Gambling techniques are regularly employed to manipulate players to spend more!
You will continuously feel that in order to self-develop, and have fun and creative time,  you need to spend more - an eternal empty promise, that of course never materialises, and works only for new sales and maximising the Game Developers' profits.
Waste of money and time. Stay away."
10292,Waste of time.
10293,good game!!!!!!!!!!
10294,"Fantastic game, I am playing WOT since 2014 and, to this day, still one of the best games I enjoy."
10295,"the match making has problems... would be a fun game if they would fix the rng
"
10296,"Im bored from this game anymore ALOT but anyways this game is pretty good if you want to have fun in ur free time
just go fun rooms and chill ;)"
10297,its a great game if your into tanks even then im not a big fan of tanks and i love it
10298,the best Game .!!!!! in the world.!!!!
10299,This game continues to go downhill. the makers of the game keep putting out over powered gold tanks that cost at least $50 to buy for each one. It's really become a pay to win game if you're trying to be good at it. their greed has ruined the enjoyment I once had. I play it a lot less than I used to and barely miss it because it's become so damn frustrating to play
10300,So addictive you'll think about the tanks even when you are making love.
10301,it ok
10302,"well they wanted me to review this game.
Well it used to be a great little game and then the weird fake tanks appeared and then the match maker was tweaked ,
i am constantly in matches with inexperienced players or bots and my win rate is tumbling no matter how i play and then there is the constant money grab tied in with the you must play 20 hours a day to get your wins in events.
i cant when no matter what tank i choose or how i play most matches are a wipe. so no play something else.
but then it is free, free to suffer."
10303,Good game
10304,"Bring back Halloween crazy mod, thats a great option to have"
10305,"Goods: A nice game if you prefer a quicker and more convenient version of war games like World of Tanks. A good balance group that makes both PC version and Mobile version have good operation experience and does not make PC players too imbalanced. 7 min max for a game and usually within 4 min, good to kill your time in short leisure time. '
Bads: The vedio quality and physical engine is limited. HP setting unrealistic but acceptable. Game matching mechanism works kind of bad partly due to stupid algorithm and partly due to a limite pool of players online."
10306,gppd
10307,"I started to play this since my PC is unable to play WOT PC. It is a nice change of pace so i'll list my likes and dislikes.
Likes
1 No artillery. Anyone who has played WOT PC hates artillery. With this version you can play without that irritant.
2 Tanks  you can earn that are not in WOT PC. Earning some are easy and others can be really hard or a pain but worth it.
3 Wargaming is very plainly obvious when they want your $. They don't bother to hide it. But part of that goes in the dislike list.
4 Joining a clan gets you assorted discounts on tanks and equipment. But you have to play the game to get them. But you get to meet and play with some nice people.
Dislikes
1 Shots fired can differ from shot to shot. First round hit does damage, following rounds bounce or pen and do no damage.
2 Smaller teams and less time per battle. Though this could also be a like for other players.
3 Same complaint for standard WOT. Overpriced premium tanks popping up all the time. The game is free to play but also pay for. And some mission tanks can be bought with gold instead of doing all stages of the mission. The Lycan from the Halloween event being a good example. And yes i more or less used gold to pull off most of the stages to get that tank and the camo for it.
4 A glitch in the recent update has been the source of irritation. Gold ammo is loaded on newly bought tanks or tanks of tier 7 and 8 that i have and never load gold on. I was charged gold until i used up my gold on crew training and conversion to free XP. The glitch continues to appear and i've relayed it to my clan mates. And will post it in the comments on the YouTube vid about the recent update.

The game has good and bad things. But overall i do enjoy it enough to play everyday. The game isn't for everybody but can and is enjoyable."
10308,Awful matchmaking
10309,Awesome game.
10310,Playing almost every day
10311,fun quick matches
10312,"You need patience to do well in this game.  A lot of reading various websites to find tips helps.  I would be nice to have some easy tank comparison when deciding what to buy.  not really clear if there is any point in keeping low tanks, if you have researched all the way to higher tanks.  After a month or so of play, not clear how other tanks of the type are much faster than my tank....more reading needed."
10313,Lots of fun and more stable on OS X than WoWS.
10314,"Wargaming is very greedy. Understand that is a free game so need dontations to keep it alive but devs greed is incredible. I hope that one day all lootboxes will disapear. Tanks in crates are made to milk money. Huge amount of money. I know player that spent over 200£ for crates to get his fav tank. That's wrong.. Another thing taht is killing game is match making. Most of my lost game are because of terrbile team. I'm always, ALWAYS in top 3 in dmg but win ratio around 54-55%. When checking my team stats can always see players with 35-40% WR. It's a joke! It's literally drives me mad. Why players with win ratio above 50-60% can't play in their own groups? Another problem are AFK players, don't know if it's server issue or just ppl quiting but one AFK player mean taht your team will loose the game.. 
Game itself is great so can't not recomend it but because of all the issues we are loosing fun.."
10315,Very fun and good community.  Join a great clan and have fun.
10316,"Honestly despite what other complain about with the ""pay to win "" aspect of basically every free game, this truly stands out above the others when comes to almost everything, and is constantly getting updated to bring more content, i hope to see you on the battle field!"
10317,"If you like ( TANKS ) this game is for you , if you do not like tanks its not for you that's it . GREAT WORK  WORLD OF TANKS BLITZ"
10318,"Tanks going BOOOMMM!!!!

Need I say anything else?"
10319,"Pro's - Good game, fast gameplay, don't get stuck in a long games so you can exit anytime, lot's of styles of tanks to play, takes some skill to have a good game.
Con's - You need to get premium in order to sustain your tanks and upgrade to new ones.  Too many things cost extra if you really want to compete with the best.  Too many players whine and don't just enjoy the game.  Can't team up with your clan - only 2 players can sign in together to a game, we usually run with 4-6 players - therefore, most of my clan (187) don't play WOTB.  I end up playing solo 99% of the time which is not as fun as with a team."
10320,honestly... i love this game keep up the good work <3
10321,Incredibly addictive and fun as long as u keep ur wallet safe.
10322,"still new...........but the game is good  >Beware  it is not free  you Will be suckerd.but..all in all  Great Game
"
10323,It's Good
10324,"pros
-cross platform
-some free and worthy tanks on events
-awesome bp rewards whether the free one or the 5 dollar which is still so cheap.
-good optimization so it runs on any pc or a budget smartphone.
-fast match making
u can watch optional ads on mobile version and get free gold 

cons
no skill based matchmaking so u could be placed between clowns and lose the fun.
-afk and bots players 
-high ping in events servers
-rage and toxic bot players all around
-ghost shell


here is some things u need to know if u have never played this game:
aiming is built to be not accurate which makes it RNG and not even close to realistic even for the distance drop shot so if you hit enemy and not moved ur aim from where u hit at all it will miss the shot. 
some unarmored tanks will bounc the shot like fv183  which is funny as it has no armor at all so we back again to the RNG system.
however, game is still one of its kind and none of these clone games could beat it with all of its pros and cons which makes it so special and still enjoyable.
to have fun u need to join a good clan and never join a match without a platoon friend.
still loving this game even if its stupid and cursed :D :D :D 
"
10325,It's a fun game
10326,"It's all about the money,  Devs are only in it to make money and matching is rigged to keep your winrate around 50% so you will buy their premium tanks for real money."
10327,"Far,far better and enjoyable than the regular WOT"
10328,Good game. Worth to spend some time on it.
10329,Fun to play with friends. Great for Nvidia Surround users.
10330,great game wide variety of tanks. great fun
10331,It’s a alright game better then war thunder in my opinion the events aren’t that great but it’s fun
10332,"Good fun Shame about the abuse. :)
"
10333,this game is awesome
10334,good game though it needs more challenging maps.
10335,its ok
10336,i like the fact that there are so  many tanks but whats wrong is to many op prem tanks are running around and not to also say that most of the players are so toxic but over all the game is good and i enjoy to play
10337,"The game is good .
But wargaming must work on the balance"
10338,"Game was kinda ,ok ,until, the rocket tanks, in understand that is arcadeish game but rockets went to far,and the nerf its a joke, worst than arty in the real worl of thank, shame, i belive most of players will play at tier 7 or just quit the game, ""GG WARGAMING ""GG"""
10339,"Been playing this game for a few years now, am now a clan leader. this game is great there's pros and cons to the game , as with any game.  But the biggest pro is the people you come in contact with every day."
10340,good
10341,"
First of all, I would say that it is not a bad game. But I see major shortcomings in overpriced tanks and in evil matchmaking. I keep watching good player videos and my stats. I am developing and growing skills, but my WR keeps falling despite rising VN8. I am very desperate about this and I decided not to buy anything from Wargaming anymore and I wouldn't invest a penny as it still makes no sense. 
So if you are looking for an overpriced game in which, despite the increasing skill you will play more calmly install it or avoid disappointment and wasted money."
10342,"I personally love this game. I've been playing for a year now It is so much fun, even with the new missile tanks, it has so many elements like figuring out how to play every line of tank. RNG may not favor me but I still enjoy the feeling of causing an ammorack or causing a turret to explode off an enemy tank."
10343,"Good gameplay but lots of flaws.

Community building tools extremely weak. Upvoting a good performance takes too many clicks.

There are some genius elements to the game, marred by incessant commercialization. 

The game is hard and can be unforgiving - that is the main attraction for me. 
"
10344,"So I'm just gonna keep it simple the devs have ruined the game with 6.7 with the ATGMs and while I will admit that 6.8 helped balance them, the Devs should either remove the tanks or the ammo type.
(the game currently is 6.8 for those wondering when this review was typed.)"
10345,"I love this game. I have been playing for about 2 yrs now.  I have spent some money on it, but i choose to spend money on things i enjoy. My favorite thing about this game is learning how to drive new tanks. Even if you pay money you still have to to have skill to properly use the tanks. I enjoy the challenge."
10346,This game is better played on the phone
10347,"overall it is a fun game to play....what i dont like is when you introduce fun tanks that are powerfull  people complain they get  destroyed too  much so you nerf them meanwhile the whole reason for spending real money on a package is the powerfull tank for instance the tankenstien when i got it i spent 50 bucks on it  now it does half the damage it used to now not so fun to play that is only 1 thing.....people who complain about ""op"" tanks should learn to not get shot duh"
10348,"Totally pay to win game. After good games and winning, you must be ""balanced"". So, you must lose a lot, without even know why or how. You just have to lose. Never saw that in a game. Maybe this is the only game that this happens."
10349,"dont even think about this game
worst match making system ever
it will ruin ur day
free to try"
10350,PLAYING THIS GAME SINCE 2015... CANT STOP LOVING IT.. <3
10351,Chơi nhàn hơn WOT
10352,nice game but you need practice
10353,Noice.
10354,"Думаю более 1,000 часов игры доказывает что игра хорошая"
10355,"The game itself is good,

but Wargaming is the scum of humanity, they don't care about their games, they don't care about their players, they don't care about feedback, they don't even care about the Content creators on youtube.

Wargaming only gives a shit about 1 thing and 1 thing only, that is MONEY, nothing else."
10356,"I like the game, though what ruins the game is the some of the players. They tend to have a better than thou attitude to others just because they have been playing for longer than others."
10357,Generally a well balanced games. Matches heavily depend on team work and support.
10358,"I enjoy the mechanics of the game. The maps are well done and getting better. The tanks are interesting. The major update that took place where many of the lower tier tanks were nerfed or eliminated negatively effected the average players. Also, the nerf that took place on the tier 7 and tier 8 popular tanks also negatively effected the average player ( 50 t0 55 win rate). Clearly, these changes were meant to help the new player success rate. All gamers understand that a ' Learning Curve"" is required for any game and they expect to struggle at first."
10359,very good
10360,i liked it but the grind is real after tier VII
10361,love this game..
10362,"Fun to play. As with any free game, if you want something better, you have to pay. You can play the long game and have more fun. Skill, strategic understanding and communication will help as well. All can be learned."
10363,USA USA USA USA USA and other countries ARE AWESOME!
10364,"Очень классная игра !
"
10365,nice little time waster.
10366,fun but need a lot of money to play it properly
10367,"Nice game, my most favorite in years.... Good, fast game, decent community....Some glitches in match making (you cant measure human factor precisely)...Always keep my interest with events and new tank models. Hate containers system, but they always offer alternatives on buying the tank you like. Thumb up from me WG"
10368,Good game!
10369,Good game
10370,Recommended
10371,"Its a cheap and fast edition of the original Wot
The community may be absolute toxic salt flat but there are some good people"
10372,you can still do mods here so gg
10373,"the world of tanks  blitz these days is still a good side game, used to be a good game overall but these days the content like events and new maps and mechanics are switched for loot box craze and a lame monthly battlepass. the game has gotten more popular and the devs have made progress much faster than the old days and as a result we have MM problems in all tiers, 90% of matches are one sided boring loss or victory and you don't get those breathtaking final showdowns. whats left? lots of tanks and tech tress to play and learn various nations and tank roles. the game still has lots of depth for those who care to explore it and thats the main appeal for me."
10374,ОЧЕНЬ КРУТАЯ ИГРА
10375,FOR QUEEN AND COUNTRY
10376,на пару танков бы побольше)  а так норм )
10377,"I love playing WOT for almost 4 years already. I have an account with the original WOT, Love their graphics, feels like im driving an actual tank. I hope in the future they can add modern tanks like M1A1 or A2 MTB and other futuristic tank."
10378,best tank battle game
10379,A very fun game. Though the Matchmaking is bad. The game is surprisingly fun. I would recommend carefully researching any premium tanks you plan to buy tho.
10380,"good game, good for relaxing"
10381,"*presses play*

Wargaming: hippity hoppity your wallet is our property"
10382,"Эта игра самая лучшая, мне она очень нравится, у меня 3.600 боёв, 54% побед, у меня есть ИС-3 Защитник, без доната, выиграл на новый год. А ещё жду ивент на самый первый танк с системой дозарядки снарядов M4/FL10, 🦀 кидает не часто, Спасибо вам за эту игру"
10383,I like this game :) realy nice and fun to play
10384,This is great game ! Gameplay very good
10385,Having a lot of fun.
10386,"GOOD GAME
"
10387,the low tiers are fine but the new missile tanks are making the game not fun to play unless you play the missile tanks
10388,i like it
10389,You will not find a better tank game.
10390,a very rigged game that slows your tank if mm puts u with trash players which is no surprise with russian devs and socialism theme unless of course you pay to win which is not fair either
10391,this game is aswom
10392,good
10393,pretty good
10394,I love the play style since the game came out it has many good improvements
10395,nice game

10402,GOOD STUFF
10403,"nice game to chill alone :<
"
10404,"Pay to play game... After reach lvl V... you will always loose money when playing, and, cant upgrade no more... the game forces you to put real money to keep playing... Fun TRAP game! bye"
10405,"The graphics in this game are ridiculous, being very toyish, and very weak, yet I have VIDEO LAG?!?!?!  I am nearly getting sick from it when playing, which, given how lame the graphics, tank images, etc., are in this game, it makes no sense.  I also play War Thunder, and the detail is so much higher in War Thunder, yet I haven't once seen video lag or felt sick.  Also, the tanks look DANG REAL, which is what I was expecting to see in World of Tanks...I feel like I am missing something here.  The upgrade piece of this game is fun, as with anything you game you get to upgrade, collect, whatever, in...  Outside that, it is so low quality on the look of the tanks, the graphics, etc., and yet with video problems, it has the feel of a garbage game.

FYI, I wanted to make sure that my review isn't plagued by newbie deaths, not understanding the game, etc...I am 9 battles in, with one loss due to not understanding the base capture thing (which was my second or third game?), where I have yet to have died in a single game, have been down to 3v1 a few times and I have always beat all three and WON, as well as have done the most damage almost always, and my last game I took out 7 other players, one of which was quite good, circling me, hitting me and running off, etc...he was a good player, but I still beat him.  Winning is fun...and I am winning...it's just that the game isn't fun."
10406,Pretty good
10407,"Она украдёт у вас всё время, будте осторожнее!"
10408,Amazing game :)

10410,good game
10411,ive been in this game for years they still got it
10412,good game
10413,I love
10414,world of tanks without arty in a 7v7 match making...must i say more
10415,Good version when you want to have more simple wot experiance
10416,"Its a game.
And it has tanks.
And shooting.
And if you read this u r gae"
10417,hella good but sense update 6.8 I've got lag in mid game even when i low the graphics :(
10418,its ok
10419,gucci game
10420,"Much faster than regular world of tanks
"
10421,"very good good
"
10422,i really like this game even if this is normal world of tanks but with less tanks and less technological trees
10423,"First Impressions:
- It was fun at first, but it heavily encouraged you towards micro-transactions and loot/crate drop boxes. Late game is just super tankers running around 1 shooting things with the fastest tanks, usually unlocked from premium tanks that cannot be unlocked from the normal game progression tier list of tanks.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pros:
- It's a medium to small scale tank fighter game
- Lots of tanks to choose from 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cons:
- Micro-transactions forever
- Very slow progression of unlocking new tanks
- Pay to play
- Pay to win
- NO tank customization whatsoever
- Only paint jobs can be customized and that is lack luster and low quality at best
- Low quality maps
- Not enough maps
- Extremely slow tank unlock progression system
- Everything costs ""gold"", despite having ""silver"", which really does nothing
- Lots of useless things to buy, low-tier player tag avatars, paint jobs, etc.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion:
- Micro-transactions and loot/crate boxes are a scourge upon the gaming consumer landscape. But, there are two minor and insignificant saving graces. The first, you can convert your earned in-game ""silver"" to premium ""gold"", at an exchange rate of 400 ""silver"" to ""1"" gold. But, that really means nothing, when any major purchase is usually around 7500 ""gold"" to 15000 ""gold"", and the earned silver will take days of play just to be able to purchase anything other than an avatar or a paint-job. Defeating the purpose quickly of even spending the time grinding for silver for days, when you can just buy with the economical approach that those days spent grinding, could have been spent bettering ones-self or just honestly working to pay for the unlock. The second, when you purchase certain endgame premium tanks, these tanks give you double to triple the ""silver"" from battles. The problem, the exchange rate is so bad, and the price of items/tanks/boosts/etc. are very high. Between the micro-transactions and the extremely slow tank tier unlock progression, the developers and marketers really are trying to force and squeeze the money out of you. It's really a bottom of the barrel game, and it feels like a lot of lost and wasted potential. Lack of tank customization, pay-wall everything, boring maps, not too much balancing between some tanks. Despite it being a tank simulator (if you can even call it that with the futuristic tanks it has in the end-game), it leaves a lot to be desired, but still marginally fun with little to no replay value because of insanely slow progression system.

10451,"Ok, first of all see how many hours I've played this game
I played for 2 years and I can admit that this game is pay2win. 
why am I saying that???
there's an answer: imagine a tank with high caliber gun and auto reload mechanism, also add thick armor to it but a bit slow tank
that's a self made $14 tank that shows this worthless game is only pay2win.
I have an advise for you guys, buy a game and do not try this free game cuz developers are waiting to heist your money"

10462,"Gameplay has improved since the last time I played the game, but the servers seems to be getting worse... somehow they can't get two things working at the same time. Good gameplay, laggy server...

Update: Server have improved, but gameplay are terrible now. 1 victory per 10 losses, I have to carry each game. I mean, seriously wargaming? Stop matching 6 lemon players with a decent player. This game is hopelessly imbalanced. Jeez, I swear this game is rigged."

10467,its good
10468,it's good
10469,yes
10470,"They need to work on the matchmaking. Long streaks of losses when you are top damage is very frustrating. It isn't just RNG. You can feel that sometimes your gun hits hard and sometimes  does no damage at all even a broadside hit on a light tank. It's ridiculous. Sometimes your armor takes all kinds of damage and sometimes a weak opponent can one shot you from the front. Again, ridiculous. 

Most holidays where they show you prizes for playing and getting some number of tokens can't be completed without spending huge sums of gold (bought with real money) to complete the stages. And if you don't pay... then you have only stock tanks to play which generally are not as powerful. 

Another ""pay to win"" racket is charging as much as 11 gold per shot to use PRAMO which is premium ammo. It penetrates deeper and does more damage. So the sysops and anyone who has gobs of money to shovel into the game can roll around dominating the free-to-play players.

I don't know if there are ""mods"" or hacks for this game but there are many times where an enemy tank you have been damaging suddenly becomes immune at low health. Hits to the rear, hits  to the flank, hits to the lower glacis plate all suddenly do no damage but they can keep on loading and damaging you. It makes no sense. There may also be mods for unlimited view range. It's not the occasional wild shot into a bush. 

Another troubling thing is when an enemy with a known inaccurate gun which requires a long dispersion settling time (KV-2 for example) turns its turret while moving and hits you from hundreds of meters away. That is only possible with hacks."
10471,"cant understand how when facing the same tank face to face i hit them and score nothing yet they take 3-400 points off me every shot,  this is a regular occurrance"
10472,yes

10497,its world of tanks before all the shit they put in the game now. it just on a smaller scale :)
10498,"When looking at ""World of Tanks"" (WoT) you need to know there are many versions.  The WOT Blitz offered here on STEAM is a simplified version of WoT.  It is faster to gain credits and gets you into the tank very quickly, it does not have the variations that the full game has.  Also, this is a pay to play platform so to be successful you will need to make micro purchases.  This purchases need to be from within the game ONLY!  If you go to the WoT web page, the tanks listed there are not for Blitz.  Only the tanks accessed through the game platform are available. For what it is it's not bad, but I am on the European Server which has lag issues.  Not sure how I got there, but I'm there.  The European Server has more players and matches work quicker, but it would be nice to have players from USA to increase chat and interaction.  Clans are a part of the game, and speaking fluently helps. Being in an active clan helps with achievements and teaming.  I highly recommend watching YouTube videos on game play for WOTBlitz from MartinDogger, Littlefinger, Bushka and others to orient you and make you more effective for both yourself and your teams.  Have fun, stay positive and its not all about the win rate, look to stats on blitzstarz.com for WN8/WN7 stats and that will be a better indicator of how good you are.  Dont try to level up too quickly stay at tier 6 asnd below until you really understand the game."

10519,"It's a double-edged sword. For players looking for a challenge, yeah this is for you(let me explain). For casual players? No, just don't even bother.

It's a challenge due to the learning curve, if you don't play your tank right, or know how to you will be slaughtered. Players that are experienced will hit your weakspots (i.e. Ammo Racks, Treads, Engine, or where your crew is ect.)  and you will most likely hit them in the front or just anywhere. Resulting in it bouncing.

The tanks are fine, even though you can buy gold tanks, but with a well placed shot their helpless. Tank Hunters, specifically the Hetzer (I.M.O) are really good at bouncing a shot and piercing them. However one would not know this unless they put some time into getting it's upgrades. Making it a very deadly foe.

However you can run into salty tryhards or just jack*sses who just spout N*gger this and N*gger that, which can be annoying to see spammed but they aren't common so you should be fine.

All in all 7/10 would bounce a shot again."

10536,"I like the wide variety and well researched tanks. The game is well structured,developing and not stale. It is a great community with alot of untapped potential. You have the potential of WAR!. Groups of clans aligning and reenacting WWII.
What I do not like is the lag time and the way the game glitches. Every Update or fix needs a fix or update.Come on guys. the techs can write the cod yes but they don't find the bugs. We do! Easy fix is this: advertise for some testers and take applications. Let the testers have access to a map or maps that they can play but are locked from others.Pay them NOTHING! Instead give them every players dream after they have completed their assignment. GIVE THEM the TANKS to play with in game. So you hire 1000 testers and give away 1000 new tanks.  Your cost is ZERO. They would not have bought them. Your profit will go up because 1000 new tanks in game will peak interest and people will buy. I say 1000 as an example because I don't Know the numbers of players,buyers etc.

10540,"If you are an average player you feel like a cash cow. I played 20k+ battles with the ""real"" WOT and I'm not new to this, however when I got to tier V. the credit earnings weren't enough to get ahead. You need some form of premium to be able to advance faster than a rheumatic snail. Also the MM need some love too. Most of my games (8-9 out of 10) I was a bottomfeeder before tier V. At tier V. this was somewhat better.
I think the PC version is poorly optimised, in many cases choppy performance when you needed most. The dealbreaker for me was the total lack of colorblind mode. The enemy tanks name is written in red, and the aiming reticle is a circle made out of green dots. The struggle was real.
If you are better than average player, don't mind the grind and not colorblind there is a chance you might like this game."
10541,"Found this after playing a similar game for a good amount of time. 
General gameplay is enjoyable, though the game mechanics are lacking. It's basically point and shoot. No bullet drop you need to worry about, modules and crew members are very hard to hit (except for tracks) and accuracy is laughable. You shouldn't be able to miss after stopping and swinging your barrel on a tank right next to you, yet WoT makes it possible.."

10547,The game is pretty cool and the tanks are historically accurate in outer appearance. The match making is a little whack sometimes though and the grinding for silver is pretty rough to buy a t9 or t10 tank but overall a good military MMO.

10562,Not worth writing a comment.
10563,The Steam version is incredibly unoptimized - constant FPS drops and random crashes run rampant. The most irritating thing is the FPS drops. which always occur as enemies appear and spike at the most VITAL times.
10564,its fun
10565," pros, allows you to be on a active battle feel, makes you think, does  allow you to be bored, continuous action. Con I still don't understand the billing concept, bought tanks I didn't get,  confusing to get to somebody who can make right or explain. Great marketing concept, but if there isn't an easy way to immediate get satisfaction one way or the other, it makes you feel like you're being cheated. PS. Hats off to the artist's"

10577,"Not so much a review but I will no longer play any games from Wargaming. I have played Tanks; Tanks Blitz; and Warships. They are all PTW!! I quit for the simple fact that no matter what I was playing I was singled out and targeted by all others. Warships was one of my favorite games until this started happening. I could be in a full group with other ships and players but  yet I was the only one being targeted by the other team. So I am completely done with anything Wargaming has to offer and have removed all games from my account and computer as well, I will never play another one of their games!"
10578,is gud
10579,i have credit card debt and depression now
10580,"And with conclusion of latest event, time to present to you - 
World of Poor devs:Milkemdry
A man's dream. A man's affection. Steel beasts with big guns and roaring heart. This game isnt about that.
This game is about being treated like a farm cow. Because devs from eastern Europe are all but poor and they want to suck every penny from you.
Concept is simple. You buy tank, upgrade it with a 122 gun, unlock next tank and repeat. To do so you NEED premium account. Or else you'll be playing the longest Farming Sim session you've ever imagined. But to get new tanks you also need ingame currency. Technically, you dont need premium account for that, but you will need premium tanks to obtain currency fast. Seems legit. Right? Wrong.
Prices on tanks are very impressive, ranging from 10-15$ up to a 100. In a mobile game. Right.
So you buy your fancy tanks, you go into a battle and oh no. Whats that? All of your teammates are already dead?
Deal with that. Game is plagued with bots and afk bots. Otherwise i do not understand the reason for so many bad players. 
At least game runs well, even on a potato. And though it might run well. Servers always have issues, especially during events. Have fun with ping jumping like a squirrel. 
There might be some events in this game, held once a quarter. Why might? Well, if you're rarely playing and you have 4 tanks, you're screwed. Event's not for you. Most of the events are for people with 50 tanks and 26 hours free, out of 24. And guess what. Some of them you can't finish w/o spending real cash, again. Latest event required to either live in game for 3 weeks or spend rougly 150$ on a chance to win something. Fantastic.
As of lately, Milkplayersdrygaming released tanks with guided missles. You've heard it right. In the age of early cold-war tanks you have guided missles. There is no protection against them and they're very strong. So strong, in fact, that match is determined by whos side has more of those tanks.
If you ever to set foot into this world of greed, retardation and hopelessness, just bring a pal along. Its not as mindnumingly painful to play this game alone.
A decent game ruined by excessive greed of Milkplayersdrygaming. 5/10"
10581,норм
10582,"game is highly inconsistent.  The game mechanics are altered from game to game so that your skills are often offset by the mm system.  The game is supposed to be a Team play game but Wargaming does a poor job in this department.  The game is structured as tiered team play.  Tiers 1-10 exist.  Unfortunately the expectation that the very skilled players play the top tier is fantasy.  Wargaming does not monitor these tiers and therefore the tiers have zero integrity and there is no expectation that your team is actually qualified for the tier.  The game also has some kind of bot system and unfortunately that part of the game is very poor.

Interestingly, wargaming does not care about this topic.  They do not mind the poor gameplay and although the game has very much potential, you will find that the matchmaking system just has no consistency and therefore your skills often get taken out of the game."

10589,"This game is very much pay to win from the premium tanks premium shells and the gold that is only obtained from the Huge containers that you only get every 16 days! And the gold is very rare. Also you can buy the credits which are used for buying equipment, consumables, provisions, camo, tanks and tank shells. You can also buy free experience with gold. With free experience you can upgrade tanks and research tanks which gives you the ability to purchase a tank. You can also purchase premium time which gives you extra experience and credits per match. Now let’s talk matches, so when you finally finish a match in a tier one or two you will earn credits but when you play a tier three or four if you don’t destroy a tank and and not take damage you will lose credits because you didn’t wait til your teammates damaged the enemy and at the last second swoop in for the kill to all the glory. Plus even when you do make money it’s very modest. There are many more problems with the game but I did find the game “fun” in the lower tiers while playing Germany. But overall the game is just a grind fest for the players who don’t have the money to be spending but a total cake walk for the large whales who have thousands of dollars to spend and for the people who can spend a little money it’s easier but nowhere close to a cake walk."

- The balance is a joke. Whatever WG's balancing department is smoking, I want some of that. For example, the Black Prince. One of the strongest heavies in the game, known for its amazing gun and armor. WG: let's buff the armor even more!
- Predatory monetization. Crates are constantly on sale. Some tanks are crate exclusive.
- Tiers 6-10 are unplayable in the game's current state AKA where 70% of the playerbase is at. Tier 10s are getting butt fked by ATGMs and the new American light tanks. Everything below that is getting butt fked by the Smasher, which is so overpowered that you'd need the brain of rat's anus to do poorly in. Did I mention the Smasher was also sold exclusively in crates recently?
- The teams. Boy oh boy are they a bundle of joy. Good luck constantly trying to carry endless hordes of braindead zombies. This is coming from someone who averaged 65% winrate at tier 8.
- Potato servers. A lot of people have ping issues on NA. Lag spikes that will get you killed in the most frustrating ways possible. Ghost shells too. Fire a shot, it goes through the enemy tank, and the hit never registers. Now you get to wait 10-15 seconds to reload, yay!

I have more fun putting my dick through a cheese grater than playing this game now these days."
10640,"World of Tanks Blitz
Probably not the best port.  When I played this on the cell phone (years ago), I had really enjoyed it, but not so much on PC.  The mechanics and controls are ok, but something just doesn’t feel right.  It was nice having all my old tanks in the garage though.   Trying to find a match with one of my level one tanks was next to impossible. Tried matchmaking with one of my friend’s several times, which resulted in waiting for a match to begin in a platoon for over 4-5 minutes.  We only played a few times before giving up and quitting for the evening.  If your coming back like I did, you may find some enjoyment from playing with your old tanks, but if your just starting out, id probably recommend you find a different game to try.  

Would I recommend it:    No.
What do I rate it:              2/5"
10641,"game is amazing and i love it

10642,"The game suggested that I use different ammo types, so I clicked it in the menu. After telling me to use the slider to free up some ammo space so that I could buy premium ammo, I am stuck. No matter what I do, I couldn't get back to the menu without force-closing the game, all I could do is use the premium ammo slider. Play the official World of Tanks game instead of this."
10643,really great game.
10644,if your pc cant run the original world of tanks than this game is amazing i have a 7 year old laptop and i run this game at max graphics 60 fps so i highly recomend this game

First of all, I'm very thankful that there's no arty in this game. I despise that mechanic in WoT, it's horribly broken and always will be as long as it's in the game. But, this game doesn't have it, and the gameplay is as lot more fluid, dynamic and fun. No classes with a satellite God view that punish you for playing. It's also less grindy, which is great too. Overall I recommend at least trying this game out, especially if you're sick of WoT like I was."
10647,"The better you get, the more games you lose. It gets very tiring after a while, being the top 3 player and losing game after game."
10648,"its cool
"
10649,NO
10650,a fun game.
10651,It's a nice and fun game for people who like tanks and don't have a lot of free time to play long matches because matches here are short but very nice. Community is mostly nice and you don't need to pay to play like a normal person so you only have to work on your skills and grind for better tanks.
10652,NOICE GAME

10657,This is a great app! I have played for five years or so. I belong to a huge Clan where I have made many friends. Join a Clan to Tourney and Platoon together.

10659,"Acidic community, if you happen to do something wrong expect a flood of messages abusing you and calling you every name under the sun and often wanting to meet and fight you.

10666,"I LOVE IT
"
10667,Easy to get into and great for spare time
10668,"After spending nearly 200hs in the game i can say for sure the game progression is not that slow compare to the WoT PC. Actually they dish out a lot of free stuff during event and you can even wacth ad on the phone to get 10 gold. But the problem is with the balance, it's hellish. Every now and then they come up with a new premium tank, new idea and they execute it horribly. After awhile they neft the tank so that no one would ever touch it again. And in some extent, the prem tank is more OP than the regular one but usually those tank being played by noob player and dollar spender so  no worry.  Recommend if you used to the toxicity of player in LoL or DotA, or able to play with noob teammate and can carry them to the victory."

you can choose between standard and premium ammonation which I find both ironic and iconic!

10680,"Mobile version of World of Tanks, tbh I had more fun with this than regular world of tanks or world of tanks console (now called mercenaries). Can be a clean sweep and people are as braindead as ever but meh, having some fun with it. More fun with a friend tho and tier 7 is full of p2w bullcrap"
10681,"Getting started is difficult, but once you have a base foundation, the rest just falls into place. Knowledge and tactics are a large part of the game. Despite that the game is fairly straight forward. Very enjoyable, I have spent over 1000 hours on the game and yet I have yet to experience all the different tanks there are to enjoy. For a free game, its worth your time."
10682,all my progres got reset and i got stuck in the tutorial because of a glitch
10683,love the game just you guys could have done better on the graphics. For me this game runs fucken amazing at 30 maybe 40 frames
10684,"This game is super fun, its competitive but casual at the same time. It is a shame that the creators don't seem to care about their playerbase much though."
10685,"it is a fab game which is sutible to all ages. some of the best moment are when ur team is working together to wards a comn gole (which is beating the enamy team)

10695,The game takes too long to reload while the enemy has .3 seconds reload time. the maps are trash just like the textures. the damage hits are absolutely unbelievable if you hit an enemy/other players it'll say -3 nut if they hit you half of your health disappears

10728,"Я после 9 часов игры заметил большой половой орган у себя в жопе,ЕСТЬ ПРОБИТИЕ!"
10729,"Great little game. No artillery makes for much more tank on tank action. The maps are smaller so the fights quite often tend to be fast and brutal... ie: great fun :) It doesnt allow as much strategic play as the original WoT, so it kind of comes down to what you, as an individual gamer, want from your game time. I like the quicker games on Blitz, although WoT is really cool too."

10737,It's awful
10738,"IM IN MY OWN DIARREA KNEE HIGH
"
10739,"To Put It Simply, I Love It. There Are Some Things I'm Not A Fan Of, Such As The New Garage, or Update 5.5, But The General Idea Of The Game Is Awesome, It's One Of Those Games Where You Can Be A Good Player WITHOUT Buying Anything, Or Buy Stuff To Speed Up Your Progress (Or In Some Cases Buy An Overpowered Tank) The More Recent Events Have Been Nice (An Example Would Be New Years Adventure). It Is A Great Game, I Would Absolutely Recommend This To Others. 

      Here's An Overall Review

         Mechanics: 9/10
         Physics: 10/10
         Selection Of Vehicles: 10/10
         Events: 9/10
         Overall: 9/10

  Again, I Would Absolutely Buy It."
10740,Very balanced and if you like to fight and grind then well... yay?
10741,"really good game.
"
10742,its a great exsperiance
10743,"С обновление с ПТУР игра потеряла всякий смысл. Качал себе ягу е-100? А, пробитие у дурака на горе в инвизе 9 лвла - больше! Да и больше любой ПТ.

Короче, нужно чтобы они ввели режим ""С ПТУР"" и ""БЕЗ ПТУР"" иначе пусть сами играют в этот отстой. Именно этим словом и нужно характеризовать игру сегодня (18,01,2020)"
10744,Pretty Good I guess :0

10749,"Great game but turning into a wallet warrior game, which is sad as i have had the game for 3 years"
10750,"I love to dip in and out of the game, not take it too serious but I do love it"
10751,nice game
10752,"Complete dumpster juice, just like the full game."
10753,"Good enough to waste my time. but remember DO NOT BUY ANY LOOT CRATE. the chances to get one is literally 1% meaning you'll need to waste more than 50$ just to get a tank, but if you dont get. you'll just earn stupid boosters."
10754,I wouldnt advise getting this game because for some f***ing reason I have to re-download it even though I didnt even delete it.
10755,good game after 575 hours

10763,This game is so much fun for the price
10764,quick learning curve
10765,They have absolutely ruined the game by adding overpowered tanks that have no business being in the game. I wish I never started playing
10766,only when bored and u can see i get bored a LOT its good only thing is u gatta spend money to get the good stuff

10774,this game is awsome despite you getting paired with highe teirs
10775,The game is fun since it is all about destroying machines rather than humans.  It has some quirks but I like the challenge of trying to destroy higher tier vehicles with lesser equipment.
10776,"Unless you are very wealthy this game and it's owners are losers, more than that we who were coned into playing the game are the biggest losers as we are out time and money."
10777,ok
10778,it's a stripped down version of WOT. Still a lot of fun.
10779,"Nice game, faster pace than original WoT"
10780,good

10783,Its a good game i like it i have played it since 2014 (PC one) and its very very fun its easy in the Blitz one
10784,Cool game!
10785,Cool game but if you pay to upgrade youll be playing other who have worked up the ladder and better that you. waste of money.
10786,nice game
10787,great game
10788,Best Tank game ever created
10789,Love it! All around great game! Simple to play. A+
10790,East fun game
10791,"Although its maps are slightly constricting, and their damage system slightly unrealistic, their general game play is fun and time put into it rewards you. By the way, it's a lot easier to learn if you've never played a tank game before to watch some tutorials - it's HARD without prior knowledge. My biggest problem is that the developers decided to put in tanks that are only available for purchase with real money, and these are often way better than the regular tanks. Also, MANY tanks are fantasy-based and look ridiculous, but are often powerful and are sometimes almost impossible to destroy. Also there are silly game modes that have ZERO basis in reality, but are optional, thank Whatever Higher Power You Believe In. Really I'm just earning in-game currency to keep unlocking better and better tanks, which hopefully will help me better those who simply empty out their wallet to beat everybody else."
10792,Game yang santai dan seru
10793,I love this game!  I had known about it for years but never tried it until recently.  Also tried the Warships and Warplanes too!  So fun!

10803,it is a very fun quick version of the original version
10804,Yes.
10805,"Hi, Why does the game keep on matching me with higher tier tanks? sometimes, i get to be the lowest tank tier on the match. and every higher tier always target me. its like i'm the only target on the match. even tho my team mate is literally  right infront of the enemy but the enemy still targets me. just wtf? and one match i was on the bush but they still spotted me even tho i wasn't shooting them then literally exploded my tank in less than 5 sec. everyone on the enemy team just starts shooting at me and the game started 10 secs before i got shot from everyone from the enemy team. luckily my team was really good and we won. please fix your match making server. make me play with my same tier. i play this game to relax not to be stressed out."
10806,"pretty nice game for what it is. 
anybody who says its pay to win don't actually know what that means. I have the most overpowered tank in the game called the tier 3 ki ni otsu which they have not sold for 4 years cause of how game breaking it in with its 1945 dpm (most tier three tanks run around 500 dpm) and i still run a 67% winrate in it. the tanks are way too balanced for anything to be pay to win. if you read any review that say to not get the game cause its pay to win just know they are retarded. also other complaints are about being outmatched and not being able to fight other tanks come from people who suck at the game. I have been playing 5 years with 18k battles and i can tell you 90% of the negative reviews come from shit players"
10807,wow !!!!!
10808,"Is a great game I started playing a little over 2 years now. There have been a bunch of great updates and events, but also a few things that in my opinion could have gone without. Such as removing a few tanks from the research trees. There are still a bunch of vehicles to use and have fun in but i will no forget the Sherman Jumbo and T-150."
10809,"rubish monky game
got smasher out of crate fk u wargayming you just want me to spend money?
Overall good gameplay, but they keep churning out fake tanks that make them more and more money."
10810,everything
10811,great game easy to learn
10812,"interactive, every game different, endless room for improvment

bad, unskilled or unmotivated team mates, players can buy their way to top tier if they learn the loopholes."
10813,you ride around shooting other tanks and they blow up

10820,Gr8
10821,"Looks alright to say it was designed for tablets. Pick a nation then upgrade your way through their many different tiers of tanks. But once I hit tier 4 all I would soon blow up after hearing “We didn’t penetrate their armour,” “Bounced off,” “We didn’t sting them,” “That one didn’t go through,” “That one bounced,” “We didn’t even scratch them.” Then the successful hits were doing approximately 45 damage to their 160+. Reading reviews from other players this only gets worse with premium tanks and ammo."
10822,"I have well over 200 hours into this game , have peeked tier 9 tank.
And all can i say is that , this game is fucking soo p2w , that even devs realize it and don't care about it , because they're so into the money , its sickening. The game is about ww2 right???? Well that's what i thought the same. Game is full of p2w future tanks , who literally have machine gun as a gun what deals 300 every shot. And you can literally die in  2 seconds. And you will say ''Why they don't just balance it out? Right'' Well as i said devs don't give a shit , those tanks literally have 300mm   front steel armor and the only way to kill em is from behind. (If you're even alive at the moment) 

Been playing this game from 2016 , where i don't really remember having these broken op tanks. Well maybe i was just low level at the time. But either way i don't recomend this game ."
10823,its still a trash game
10824,mantep lur hehe
10825,idk just play it
10826,"Overall better than World of Tanks.

+faster game flow (7 players vs 15)
+ammo mechanic (""Gold"" ammo with better pen. have lower dmg)
+wisible where penetrate armor
+events
-match maker, one team with  players 55%+ WR vs. team with noone better than 45%WR is common  and gives uncoparatible machines against, like medium in stock vs heavy in top configuration
-RNG on everything
-not clear mechanics in pen, dmg...

and as common in free games afkers...
frustrating MM same as WoT"

There is a serious bug where you shoot a ""Ghost Shell"" and you don't do any damage. This can make the game very frustrating as a tank that should be dead can now kill you."

The problem is fixed and everything is good. I do like the game but think it's on the expensive side. Seems you have a better chance when you pay to win."

10883,no strategy at all..its css in tanks.... stay in the back....stay in groups...be the last out of spane and you will succeed.
10884,"7 vs 7 players aint good enough, games end far too quickly and the timer is only 7 min long. It should be 10 vs 10 and max 10 min timelimit each game. Its time to make this game playable because today its simply not. Ive had so many defeats because there are only 7 members and its hard to face 7 vs 4 if the others are dead. And ive had many draws because the timer has simply ran out. Its enoying and stupid. fix this at once and plz let War Gaming know"
10885,Great fun tanking but potentially expensive
10886,Oyunum sürekli atıyor oynayamıyorum. (Sorunum yeni güncellemeler ile düzeldi. :)
10887,Well its pretty micro transactiony but this game is really fun with friends as you can make platoons and play in training matches.The matchmaking and progression and moderation is kinda bad.I suggest you get a gold tank ASAP cuz then youll not lose money every match.
10888,"played before love it.
"
10889,"Hello, what has happened lately for some reason my account changes my controls from keyboard/mouse (PC) to screen touch and I don't notice it because it is always on keyboard and mouse settings and when I start a battle I lose all control over my tank and I end out losing the battle. This has happened several times.. WTF!!!!
The number of players that don't know how to play is very frustrating and to the veteran plays and it is very difficult with players that don't understand what you write to them during the battle. I try to help them and they just don't understand and this is a shame.. Lately the matching has not been good at all. What WG did to the KV-1 is a crime especially when match against tier VI, really WG you took armor away and the KV-1 did not move any faster.. Something is wrong here!!! You help the new players on the Russian Server but how about the NA, EU maybe Asia (not sure about Asia). At present the way the meta is I would not recommend this game."
10890,FUN
10891,great game. Doesn't even lag a little bit
10892,yes

10896,"It's only till now that I realise this game has such poor mechanics sigh...I mean i enjoy the game play itself but the rewards system such as losing more Credits when losing a match and earning less Credits when winning a match. The worst is you don't gain overall experience when using different tanks. You earn experience with what tank your're battling with  which means you are trapped using one or two tanks. You guys know what i mean. 

We shouldn't lose credits bottom line.
Ok sure I continue to play but only out of hope. Hope i land a shot or win a match.

i can't upgrade my tank i;m losing to much credits it's insane.
Does this company not want us to keep on playing."
10897,"It's fun at first. Simple concept: Get a tank from one of the nations available, drive it in to battle and upgrade it. Progress to the next tank in the line. But as you get higher and higher up in the tiers, you begin to see the influx of premium vehicles and highly skilled players. It also becomes far more difficult to upgrade your tank and earn credits, especially without a premium account. Additionally, when events swing around, it is usually difficult to reap significant rewards unless you have the time to grind non-stop. 
But wait! There's always an alternative! Don't like the tech-tree tanks you're offered? BUY a premium vehicle with better statistics and money-making potential! Don't have the time to grind for events? Buy your way through that as well!
TL;DR:
-Game is fun at times but gets increasingly frustrating
-You need to spend a lot of time on it to progress
-Sometimes toxic players/environment
-P2W
-Has the same lootbox system as so many other games. You're forced to gamble again."
10898,"easy to play, instant action, a bit of a tech tree, lots of online competition."

10901,good shit
10902,"its epic
"
10903,fun
10904,I don't reccomend this game. It totaly sucks. A lot of players don't know what they are supposed to do and they are often rude. Also if you want to win the battles you need to empty your wallet to buy better tanks. And I also think that the game isn't ballanced very well. Very often you are playing against stronger tanks thaht are paid and the chance of winning the battle is almost zero.
10905,"It's like call of duty just follow rules
nothing else
just killing"
10906,wot in simple way no arty but more fantasy op tank and tier 7 team is like braindead but overall this game great

10938,good game
10939,So glad WG decided to listen to the community and add some very juicy contents.
10940,"Been on this game since the early days and I have to say that for any new players coming in, I would highly recommend to NOT waste your time on this game as it NOT a good game in the long run. With the devs being greedy as they are and not putting much effort into balancing this game, I have to say this game will bring nothing but toxicity. From P2W tanks to the toxic playerbase to in-game events (90% of them being P2W btw) to broken matchmaking to the afk problem, Its all just a clusterfk of corporate fkery. Being a F2P player for this game is going to be a grind, but the game will find ways to pull you into spending some of that hard earned money of yours. I've read reviews from players who had about 1000+ hours in this game and believe me, this game is dying. I urge you new players to steer clear from this game. As enticing as this game is to new players, all it will do is waste your time and give you bs. Heed this warning."
10941,.
10942,Not for mobile but for Pc I recommend this game before you land to WOT.

If you dont you will still love this game everybody loves this game. Great for all ages but i gotta say e50m looking hot bro. Overall this game may have saved my life.

 it gets changed and updated a lot. still fun after a year off im back into it . if your reading this come join our cheekyclan . :)"
10977,Woah didn't know this game would involve tanks O.O..... one hell of a plot twist
10978,"pew pew pew pew pew pew, that is how gun do"
10979,"I have a love/hate relationship with this game.  I suggest you give it a shot.  You have nothing to lose.  The learning curve can be steep and sometimes brutal.  You *can* play the game without spending a penny.  I have spent money.  I don't regret it.  A word of caution, the community in this game is quite toxic.  Rarely a match goes by that someone doesn't have something piss poor to share."
10980,pew pew with the E 25
10981,Its a good game for your past time.
10982,Yes it is very nice
10983,"It has its charms, though if you are looking for something serious like Warthunder then this game will let you down. Been playing this game for around 2-3 years now, it's a semi fun arcade like tank game. Although will be a quite grindy after you reach tier 5. It got a nice and a wide selection of tanks from different nations (including  a recently added European tree!). Most of the tanks in-game existed in real life while some raise suspicions if the tank really existed or is just a made up one (ex. Chinese and German mostly) But who cares, well... if you are a hardcore historian... then maybe yes. The game is best played with a friend, as the game features a Platoon system where you can play in the same team with your friend. If you ignore all the new premium tanks and so on, you'll be in for an interesting and possibly a fun experience. 

pros:
-Tons of tanks
-Each tank feels new
-Makes you want to listen to Russian music while playing
-A good way to kill of boredom
-Available on both mobile and pc
-Daily, every 2 days and weekly free chests which have a low chance of giving you a premium tank.
-nice maps

cons
-HP system 
-RNG based
-a lot of P2W
-grindy events
-no way for pc users to earn free gold while mobile users can get 10 gold for watching ads.
-teams can be full of idiots or good players (but that's RNG)
-be sniped by gods hand as invisible tanks destroy you
"
10984,"This game is a great escape from the harsh and unforgiving WoT PC game. 
Pros
-NO ARTY!
-Relatively balanced tanks (Not lots of Russian bias like in PC)
-You don't have to pay credits for upgraded equipment
-6th sense is on every tank (You don't have to grind for it)
-One unified crew instead of a crew for every tank.
-Extremely diverse set of equipment avaliable unlike PC
Cons
-STUPID CRATES (Borderline gambling for tank inside)
-Many horrible players, I've played several online team-based games in my life, but the teams in WoTB.........are something else. I've seen more stupidity and utterly trash players in WoTB than i have in every other team based game combined. i just don't understand how people can be so horrible and pure garbage at a quite simple game."
10985,.
10986,its a pretty good game but you will have the occasional shit and retarded teammates even in the higher tiers other than that really good game.
10987,quite a good game for it to be free
10988,its good fun and free
10989,"Challenging game. Avoided attempts to provoke extra charges for equipment improvement. Okay with fact that I always seemed ""out gunned"". Noticed that almost any engagement, except for extreme long distance, seemed to result in sudden appearance of overwhelming forces, often from behind.  These forces appeared suddenly, with no ""radar"" warning. Have to say, made me suspicious that activity was AI / software generated instead of being a result of fellow gamer movements. Very discouraging/frustrating. Plan to stop playing and look for other similar games. Too bad. It is fun for a while."

I am playing it on steam at the moment because I am trying it out on a different platform. I will say that the game store is horrible most of the time and most of the events are gambling fests but overall its a brilliant game that requires months and months of practice to reach high level game mastery and even to this day I am still learning new game play tactics to outsmart my opponents."

11009,Bad community.
11010,r
11011,great game but totally trash p2w event
11012,"So the game is fun to a point. The tier system ranks player rating so if your a good player you quickly find yourself not being able to find a match on tanks under tier V. At tier V the price and cost of research quickly kicks in and becomes super grindy. To keep moving along you find staying with the 1 nation you are the meta for certain tiers.

so annoying when your tier V tank is high in the ranking and your player rating goes up and then your fighting in games vs 1 or 2 tier higher tanks. which then creates super bad mis matches.

Imagine being a good enough player they bump you up a tier but you can't afford tier VI tanks so you find yourself in battles where you can't pen there armour from any angle.

this is where they start to press you with micro transactions to buy gold ammo that does less dam but lot higher armour pen. so now your lower tank can be compentative for a price. An that price is gold which you can only earn through real world cash.

same for premium tanks, gold only purchase which earns more in game cash and more exp.

So the game i rather smart getting you hook and then saying hey 250gold is just pocket money whats $5 a day to play now then?

67 hours in and i don't wanna say how much i've spent before i clued into this farce,

free to play my arse."
11013,good game
11014,is good game to eat at
11015,"To keep this review short:

[b] The good stuff: [/b]
-Free to play
-Lots of tanks to play
-Different tank classes
-Each one has its own playstyle
-Short games
-Runs on potato laptops

[b] The bad stuff: [/b]
-Paid tanks most of the time are OP
-Lots of grinding (I mean, [b] LOTS [/b] )
-Somewhat toxic playerbase
-RNG that can really f*ck you up sometimes
-Cannot exchange credits into gold, so you have to spend money in order to get it (or get it from events, vouchers, coupons etc.)

[b] TL;DR [/b]
Overall, pretty fun game to spend time on. Matches are short, requires skill and a functioning brain, gameplay varies on the tank you play on.

8/10

11017,"A really great and robust microtransaction system , with a fun tank-style mini-game. Even runs in Linux.

This is a great example of a great microtransaction system, with a small game built around to test it.

If you want to try out Pay-To-Play, Pay-To-Win, give this great microtransaction system a try, the tank mini-game is ok, but the real gem here, are the microtransactions.

Did I mention the micro-transactions? Don't forget about the microtransactions.

-Players tend to be very toxic;
-Skins, premium tanks and bundles are pretty goddamn expensive.
In other ways, at first, same as with the main World of Tanks game, first and most important, expect a long and hard grind."

but hey 690hrs hahaha im so funni laugh now! LAUGH AT THE FUNNI GUY"
11032,"This game is amazing

, however, the main problem with this ""f2p"" game is p2w

I expect this game to die within 2 years if WG doesn't start changing their game cause this problem is growing and growing. An example of p2w is here: https://prnt.sc/XlwRXurKlcae (screenshot website it's safe)

(look at the screenshot or else this won't make any sense) So you would think there is a massive discount sale or something... but in reality, it's just wargaming being wargaming. If something isnt 45%+ discount than something is seriously wrong.

also keep in mind these are ""exclusive"" offers... I see the exact same tanks every month lmfao

to sommerise, this game is fucking beatiful but i wouldnt recommend anyone playing it today cause of the extreme p2w problem. (most battles have more p2w tanks than f2p tanks)
Also, not all premium/collector tanks are considered ""p2w"" but i would without a doubt consider most of them ""p2w"". And there are more ""p2w"" tanks than tech tree tanks... so now it should be easier to imagine how big of a problem this really is. Anyways, have a nice day."

11035,"Here is what you need to know about this game:
-This is a game made by WG.
-WG probably is the greediest company out there.
-Not blatantly P2W, but it actually is. (it's mobile game, aka cash cow :)
-WG does not care about the playerbase.
-Tanks in this game are balanced according to the stats gathered from 1% of the playerbase (best players out there, with over 60% win rate).
-Most of the player base is really toxic. Good players are toxic, bad players are even worse, big autismos, who cant even accept any criticism.


So, what do we have, a game in which balance is a joke, a mobile game made by the greediest devs out there, probably on par with EA. Toxic community, if not toxic, they do not have enough IQ to be toxic - go figure!

Do not waste your time..."

11129,"This game i used to play countless on my ipad back a few years ago. Returning to this, game, its garabge.

They toke out HALF of the tanks, and replaced half of the tech trees and dumbed them down so that 7 year olds on their phones wouldnt be as complacated.

For the tanks that remain have been raped in nerfs, the luchs, the hetzer are all horrible now.
Now the game is full of useless paid content that would even match ea in quantities 

If you want to play world of tanks, play the pc version and not this garabge."

11133,.
11134,really fun

11138,Good Game ! thank you guys for it !
11139,"I want to like this game so much, because tanks are cool, they look fantastic in this game, and the maps are many and varied.

However, even though the tanks are barely balanced within the same tier, you consistently (80+% of the matches, no exaggaration) get put up against higher tier tanks - and not 1 or 2, but more often than not 4-6 (out of 7). Somehow Wargaming thinks it's fun to have to fight tanks that are better armed, better armored, faster, and have more hit points than you. And that's just the atrocious matchmaking - let's discuss the RNG!

The RNG regularly has you aiming at the center of a tank, waiting until the aiming reticule is at its smallest, almost completely filled with the enemy tank, only to have the game make you miss anyway, while a slow-aiming tank like the KV-2 comes around a corner, without bothering to stop moving hits you for 900 damage from halfway across the map, and pops back behind a rock before it even become visible.

Because yeah, the vision system is ridiculous as well. Tanks can hit you because they can see you through some bushes, yet remain invisible to you. On the other hand you cannot use your medium tank for flanking to sneak up on that enemy tank destroyer that was invisible earlier, because when you get close you auto-appear on their map, complete with a little alarm, even when they're not watching your way at all. And not when you're about to hit them in the rear, no, they have ample time to turn their gun toward you.

What, you have heavy frontal armor that in real life no gun can penetrate? Well whaddayaknow, they found something to screw that up too. The Pay to Win system, besides letting you buy tanks that are unbalanced (better than the rest) in their own tier but hardly ever get put in higher tier battles, also allows you to buy special ammo that penetrates anything. So that Tiger II that in real life could simply not be penetrated by anything on its frontal armor, can now be penetrated by even light tanks.

All in all it's a very frustrating game where it's no miracle people say that the matchmaking and RNG is rigged to favor certain types of tanks or players. The high rasting here is no doubt mostly based on people who didn't get much beyond tier 4 - the lower tiers are much more fun as they are better balanced, you more often get same-tier battles, and their is no PTW ammo."

11153,"Not as challenging as the regular game, but fun if you have a limited amount of time.  moves very fast."
11154,"FPS from a variety of tanks , if one takes the time to learn the roles of the 4 classes of tanks combined with 6 other players on your team , winning will be the norm. If you play this game and drive in your tank aimlessly you will be a burden to your team. This  fun game starts at a beginner level and one should in my opinion not progress up to next tier till achieving a 50% win rate , in so doing will ensure a good time for your TEAM and you,,GL"
11155,Yes.
11156,Still a fun game after 9 years. You can buy premium tanks....but the advantage you get is nothing if you dont know how to play. Lots of nubs buying tanks and still suck. Skill is still required
11157,"Having spent time with all makes of tank the result is still the same.As soon as you reach tier
six or seven it becomes almost unplayable for most of the time so obviously some spotty

11191,"Fun game about tanks, has lots of variety in gameplay and tanks, also has good teamplay. Quite grindy at higher tiers, but this game more fun then normal WOT in my opinon at least.  You can get screwed by bad matching if you don't have a competent platoon mate. Platooning with other tankers is a big highlight."
11192,"Quick in and out, low wait times, must learn where some tanks armor is weak for damage. Watered down but faster pace than WoT imo. If you don't have time for long games this is perfect"
11193,i like blowing up stuff and this is a fun way to do it
11194,"The number of offers to buy in order to have a better experience is just overwhelming. These devs are extremely money-hungry, it seems. Not with my money! Not recommended at all. I hate games doing these microtransactions. Hateful they are!"
11195,good game
11196,World of Tanks Blitz is a good tank game. I also have the Xbox One version of WoT Blitz. I recommend this game for you all!
11197,Good game but its coming P2W and they doesnt stop adding many tanks that has many good things and very little weak things
11198,it's a good game if you have time to level up
11199,help
11200,"Not a bad game for free - but very hard to get upgrades etc etc . but all good fun 
well worth playing  7/10 
only got PC so cant comment on other formats"
11201,Lots of fun. Almost like geriatric CounterStrike.
11202,Just please stop with all the premium tanks. Before the game was balenced but now this game is pay to win
11203,"Really enjoyable game, but the developer's commercial approach is a very large downside. For example, the highly toxic community is apparently totally okay for them. You can flag players for their toxic remarks, but there's hardly any follow up. As a result, there's a lot swearing and a very negative atmosphere all over. In the long run this absolutely hurts their income but they are probably blind to that.

So only play this game if you don't mind the regular insults being thrown back and forth. EDIT: simply DISABLE the in-game CHAT."

11210,like
11211,been playing the game for 3 years now ive enjoyed a bit more grindy then the pc world of tanks thats mainly bc there isnt as many tanks and battles are smaller
11212,this is an awsome game i loved to play it
11213,lots of fun
11214,"This is actually more fun than the PS4 version, games are quicker and the tanks feel a lot more balanced. The only minor gripe is repetative maps as the lack of maps leads to virtually the same strategy every match."
11215,its epic ;)
11216,This game is designed very well considering it is cross-platform with mobile. The lower mid levels are a lot of fun and very competitive. But later on you'll run into a pay to win wall
11217,good game for wwii tank lover

11255,Another Pay to Win game.....like a World of Tanks and many more MMO or Battle Royal game.
11256,Game is a pay to win game. The Matchmaker is rigged to keep you around the average 48% winrate. Always one team or the other way overpowered.

One thing i can say is that i prefer this game on Steam due to the stutters on a low end mobile device (which is common where i'm from). Another thing I have to note is that it may take time to get used to higher-tier battles."

11271,the game is extremely pay to win the matches are either too fucking one sided or just it feels like you are playing against bots the core mechanics arent really fun either though it leaves room for some tactical game play which can be pretty fun but overall most of the games are repitation of the same fucking cycle

11299,"Pay to Win, Awful Community and Poor Dev Choices.

So game really gone down hill. The biggest complaint I hear about is how bad the matchmaking is ect... ""teams are bad"". Which is true but its not the players fault. Blitz added a bot system for all new players so that can ""learn the game"" and try satisfy player community who consistently whine about bad teams. Get worse... bots are really bad and basically moving targets for players to shot at. Which can be fun until you have enough battles to where you are thrown into the lions pit. With no skills and extremely bad habits, these ""new"" players invested 100's of hours and usually money at this point to find out they have no clue how to play. Which makes the community cry more and I'm tired of listening to it."
11300,One of the best tank game.
11301,"There are many claims that the game is a toxic environment in general. I've sunk 10 hours into this game and have yet to see any negativity. This game isn't too serious (it's not a huge issue if you go afk mid game), although there is a competitive aspect. Keep in mind I've only gotten to tier five tanks and the top tiers are probably much more active in chat. Good to kill some time, the map pool is pretty limited till you get to fourth tier tanks."

11304,before i played this i..well still have 2 6 foot 3 feet dicks two ponys wifes (who get along)..make it 4 dicks that are 8 feet 5 foot (two for each of my wifes) we have sex everyday for 24 hours(i can't die have infinite energy and i can spared it to anyone i want) i am also always hony and my wife are also always hony we never get tired of the same sex position i cum for 12 hours and i cum 500 gallons a second and then we keep going GOD having two wifes is a dream

Missions are alright, tanks feel somewhat balanced and graphics are nice."

Now that i am at a higher tier I have waited up to 20 minutes and still did not get in a battle. Queue was up beyond 50, I have even bought a Premium day with no battle available. It seems by mandating 14 tanks per battle tier it limits the tiers with fewer tanks to play even when they purchase a premium day. It would be fun just to battle 2,3,4, tanks or even the computer."

11342,"Game review *clap* *clap*

	World of Tanks Blitz (WotB) is mobile tank shooter game that came from its big brother World of Tanks (WOT). It’s basically just a smaller, less demanding WOT. The gameplay is a bit different from WOT because of the smaller team composition and maps.

Pros:
-	Less taxing on the PC
-	Fast and adrenaline filled battles
-	A simplified tech tree (compared to WOT)
-	No arty
-	Skins

Cons:
-	The most toxic game I ever played
-	Crates 
-	Expensive premium tanks 
-	No so great graphic wise
-	Skin (most of them are gaudy)

Conclusion 
	I don’t recommend this game to other people but that’s just my opinion, it’s better for you to try it out first till tier 5 or 8 where the tanks gets better (hey the game’s free). Right now the developer are just milking the player with skins and a lot of premium tanks. They sometimes even re-sell the collectors tanks (basically tanks that got taken out of the tech tree). The toxic in-game community is also the worst I’d ever seen. Still if you want a game that is fast paced and with a relatively complicated in-game mechanics then you could try this game out.

11374,The Game is pay to win and the match making is broken.

11395,"Okay,
so you are playing a mobile game via Steam on your Computer?
Yes I am!

You may ask why. I will give my reasons as well as my opinion in the following review.

World of tanks blitz is the small brother of the original World of Tanks.
The basic mechanics of the game are still the same — you can either capture flags or destroy every tank of the enemy team. As stated above the game was — and still is — being developed for mobile devices. This boils down to smaller battles, smaller Maps and shorter battles. And to run this game on smartphones: a much smaller filesize (wouldn't you like to install a full 60 GB of the original World of Tanks on your Phone?). To keep the files small the Textures are not that great — to say the least — and Maps are rather being reworked and improved than adding new ones. The game is still being supported by the developer and updates are being delivered. Just recently they added new decals to see if — and where — shots hit a tank and chain tracks left by the tanks on the map.

But all this still doesn't explain why I am playing this rather than the original game. I used to play World of tanks blitz many hours on my tablet a few years ago. Since that died I could just log in on my PC and play on — right where I stopped playing. Further the short matches of approximately 3 – 5 minutes are way more motivating than having to wait 15 minutes on your tank to be playable again in the original.

So, to who would I recommend this game?
- everybody who wants to use their tanks they have on their mobile device on your PC.
- People who enjoy pretty quick matches. Both in terms of waiting for a match and the match itself.
- Persons who can't run the original game — older laptops for example.
- People who just want to have a look in the whole World of tanks universe by downloading only a few GB
- People with rare space on their Drives.

Who wouldn't I recommend this game?
- People who say they need good graphics to play a game.
- People who enjoy the larger scaled world of the original

Conclusion:
It is in most cases worth to check this game out. It can be hilarious — especially when playing with friends — and won't take much of your important time if you don't want it to do so — again: small download, short battles.

If you liked this review and i were able to help you this would make me really happy. Consider giving a thumbs up, using the new “award” system or giving me any feedback."
11396,Great game.  A lot of fun.  I would highly recommend it to everyone!
11397,Fun.
11398,Very addicting game and you can easily play the whole game without spending $$$
11399,Its annoying but when u get good its easy
11400,Too many bad players at tier 10 and higher tiers. So many pay 2 play tanks. Tier 8 has become the joke. Newcomers ruin battle for for somewhat experienced (~10k and above) players. They go AFK or die uselessly. Even tier 10 is getting filled with premiums slowly. Its sad that this game used to be much better earlier. Although I would say graphics has improved significantly.
11401,"
its hella fun"
11402,"Not only shooting but also team work to win, very good game to play with friend."
11403,"Super fun game, I've been playing almost a year and I absolutely love it. Great people, great tanks, great fun

1300 hours later, it is nonstop suffering."
11404,"This game is surprisingly fun once you get used to getting blown up easily, trust me it's a game you don't wanna miss. :D"
11405,GOOD GAME
11406,"I had around USD$1500 worth of premium tanks. The shitty devs turned more than half of them obsolete and no longer premium, but ""collectible"", concurrently nerfing them. Disgustingly untrustworthy."
11407,Its Tanks!!!!
11408,"pretty fun game if u want to learn how to play,
it will be frustating game if ur not,
reminder:pretty grindy."
11409,It's fun!
11410,"best tank game ever
"
11411,"This game is like crack.   Just as much fun at lower levels with free stuff, which is a big plus.   Getting into and out of games is a breeze too."
11412,"Pretty p2w,but the game is pretty easy and ok for everyone."
11413,"Nice game, sometimes slow progression, but if you're down for a grind it's rewarding."
11414,"Pretty well balanced game (freemium and premium players), the only problem is matchmaking which is sometimes really dumb. But worth the try."
11415,gud game
11416,Great game with great tanks! I like the faster battles!
11417,пп

11419,.
11420,lots of fun
11421,"This is a mobile game.  You play this on your school iPad Air with your friends when your classes get really easy during your sophomore year of high school cause you can't pay for your own computer.  Why is this on steam?  Why are you playing this on steam? Go play actual World of Tanks at least.  Better yet, go play War Thunder (though that isn't wonderful late game ;-;)"
11422,"PROS:  No Arty 

CONS: Still janky Wargaming match making and RNG hits 


Would recommend for casual play"
11423,Steam is a good multiplayer game.  Quick run and gun matches and pretty good graphics.  The matchmaking seems a bit messed up right now.
11424,you spend money on good tanks and you get stuck with horrible players on your team making the money you spent a total waste
11425,"




Fun game and you can advance without spending money if you want."
11426,get stuck with lousy players on your team making the chance of winning very low many times
11427,good game
11428,It's good and fun to play
11429,Great game just to have fun and shoot tanks. the grind for the tanks at the end of the teck tree is a bit repetitive. for new players i recommend to play for fun not for new tanks
11430,How you have to earn the tanks
11431,its fun and its a great challenge.
11432,I would like to see more customizable things in the private matches. But overall I enjoy the game a lot.
11433,"Extremely good game to play. Pretty addictive when you reach to mid tiers, and are really enthusiastic about it, joy just gets better.
"
11434,nice
11435,Good
11436,very addictive especially if you like simulation games
11437,A great Shooter game for history buffs
11438,Fun game quick battles so you can enjoy the game and not be tied down.
11439,"Fun, better play with your friend. Play as Girls und Panzer tank with voice crew Nishizumi Miho, panzer vor. and i love it."
11440,Autist brother of World Of Tanks.
11441,"Short term and boring + p2w

11442,play for the tiger
11443,Awesome Game
11444,good game
11445,its a great game i think
11446,A very good game for those who like tanks.
11447,Much more balanced than the full version of world of tanks. Also runs great on old and cheap hardware. Smaller maps and fast games.
11448,"Game is full of salty crack heads.
But i got used to it."
11449,Love this game!
11450,Its fun
11451,It is very fun. Plus it is releastic. War thunder is a little more but this game is still very good. I also recommend the other games wargamingnet has made.
11452,"The game is interesting, but the problem is toxic players, which is quite a lot 7/10"
11453,amazing historycal game
11454,yes
11455,"100% identical to War Thunder accept accept its not as much graphically designed as War Thunder. Same bullying design factors in the game as War Thunder where's there's no fair playing field. They allow elite players or rich people to buy tanks with all the goodies go in and bully all the new players and poor players and use them as target practice with tank destroyers and advanced purchased tanks. Although this game allows for more hits to take you out while in battle, it's still promotes aggressive bullying by design. Players should have the ability to filter out elite players while being matched with players. This way they have a choice of what level of players the feel they can battle against and have fun. It promotes fun with a choice of spending cash on upgrades rather than forcing you to spend money to upgrade just to have a fair opportunity to play the game. I play this game less than 8 hours. I uninstalled it because of it's aggressive bullying design."
11456,"this is not pay to win game, just trash teammates"
11457,.
11458,good
11459,This game has no competition in genre. She is simply nice.
11460,very good!!!!!!
11461,ok
11462,This is one of the best free games out there
11463,"Another P2W game. Want to win? You can buy premium tanks for expensive money and without experience you can fight in high tiers as stu pid premium noob.
Absolutely stupid match making - one side beginners with a few battles and a terrible score, against them experienced pros with premium tanks and high scores. The game normally creates teams with five premium tanks on one side and none on the other side. So the result of 7-0 battles is very common.
This play is a waste of time, you'll find out after a few hundred games."
11464,top
11465,nice
11466,All in all a good game. 8/10
11467,.
11468,the best game ever
11469,"Good stuff, just play; it's free."
11470,"just pay to win . people with the most money win . I hit a tank 8 times in various places and caused zero damage . he hit me once on the front of my tank the strongest part and i was destroyed  . He had the same tank as me , a matilda , How can this be . I was also shot from behind by an invisible tank . nothing for at least 2kms and the enemy ony had 3 tanks left and i could see them on the map in front of me . This has happened a few times"
11471,if you like normal world of tanks this is a lttle worse but there is no arty so its better and easyier to run
11472,free and good
11473,The difference between this and the PC version is that this is the experimental version with all their weird partnership vehicles that don't exist.
11474,love the mm
11475,"While I only played the original a couple time and lost interest for whatever reason, this version is awesome. Being old school, I hate microtransactions so I don't like that but it has not kept me from buying serveral nice tanks and lots of gold. I wish the graphics had more heavy options as I'm about to purchase an RTX 2080 ti but what's there in this game is good."
11476,I have been playing this game for a couple years now and i have enjoyed the time i have put into it.
11477,its gud
11478,No anime. <3

Only A stupid retard would pay that price for a tank...."

11485,yes
11486,Free and easy
11487,Quite challenging!!!
11488,"Its a good game to play because it has good graphic, has real tanks and is just a fun game in general. I really like it because you can buy most of the items except the stars you use to upgrade the tanks and that mean you have to work for it. so that why I recommend it"
11489,GOOD GAME
11490,cb
11491,adas
11492,best game ever . It just funn
11493,"This is a really fun game only spoiled by the lack of a colourblind option. For the 1 in 12 of us men in the world who are colourblind, Red/Green is a nightmare. In World Of Tanks ( NOT Blitz) they have a Yellow/Blue option, which makes it playable."
11494,cooooooolllll guuuuuuddd superrrr !!!
11495,"just a fun game to keep some good feelings to play,"
11496,totally intrusive and requires separate email from Steam .... very aggressive about making payable situations in order to continue play
11497,"good game, enjoyed the graphics"
11498,it's fun
11499,feels good to destroy enemy tanks

[b] Mobile Tank Game That Will Beg You For Your Money [/b]

I was confused when I started up this game. It seemed like every match got more difficult as I progressed, yet the names of my opponents were so similar. Half of them had a name followed by ""_gunner"", and their tanks were doing much more damage and took much more of a beating than my own. I chalked it up to progression, and after looking in the store, found literally every item purchasable with currency acquired with real-life money. Then it hit me: this is a cash-grabbing mobile game. I quickly stopped playing and moved on with my day.

I will continue to [b] Not Recommend [/b] lazy mobile games such as this one, since their main purpose in to provide a gameplay loop which is heavily influenced by the player's willingness to spend money to ""get better"". It's an insanely unfriendly business practice for the consumer, and should stay on the mobile market where it first originated. There are plenty of other tank combat games out there that will not try to get you spend $5 or $10 here and there on menial cosmetics, let alone actual advantages like this game here does.

[h2] Final Verdict: 1/10 (Bad) [/h2]

11501,great game if you are willing to spend a hefty amount of time on it. definetly worth a try
11502,"I like the pace.  I like that the vehicle characteristics reasonably reflect historical records.  Fun to play in small random teams.  When you get a group that works together it is a lot of fun.  

Dislikes - Money talks in loading out vehicles and mods.  Too many players make derogatory comments inferring someone is a ""noob"" without actually checking.  Too many players have little patience with others making mistakes or actually being new.  I'm still waiting for them to release a mode where the teams reflect actual historical battles and players get assigned the vehicles in a battle at random."
11503,good game. or at least it used to be.
11504,"I have always liked the World of Tanks series and moving from console to PC to play it has been a great experience. I enjoy WoT on both platforms, both offer exactly what you are looking for when it comes to a historical game and one that offers awesome tank battle destruction."
11505,"Good game!
Отличная игра!"
11506,easy to play
11507,"This is a waste of time. Good game, addictive, but waste of time. It is made in such way that you will never get good score. once you won few rounds, they will mix players in such way that you will loose everything you achieved. WinRate, Rating points, coins and so on. And after you lost everything you will realise that you wasted your time. And in the end, there are a few technical issues... sometimes you have instant accuracy during fireing while your tank or your turet is moving and sometime it's like you ust begun as a rookie. And the last one.... they say you cannot use cheat codes. However I got shot trough buildings and hills. Explain that !"
11508,good
11509,Great game and the strategy just goes and goes.  It's easy to learn but difficult to master.
11510,every awesome game
11511,"In my opinion the game is one amazing one. My cousin brought me into it and man, since the second i started i couldn't really stop playing. It's addictive and fun in general, but remember that is all my opinions.
In general I would recommend this game for others! Again, my opinion, however if you are ever curious definitely check it out!"
11512,"Like tanks? Well, this is a world full of them."
11513,"this game is very nice game
"
11514,.
11515,LOV IT
11516,great than other
11517,I'am so happy to use my favorite tanks in battle
11518,"No, I absolutely wouldn't recommend this game to anyone because of how much anger and stress this game is going to give you. The game is infested with filthy retarded 30%-40% win rate players, autistic trolls, afk cunts and pay to win whale faggots. The RNG in the game will fuck you in the ass with a cactus while you have fucking hemorrhoids."
11519,"Extremely pay to win and it's being used as a test bed for possible changes in the main pc game, World of Tanks. You're gonna struggle past tier 4 (which only takes a few hours to reach if you're any good) to maintain the normal currency without paying for a premium account. Premium tanks, which make extra experience and money cost more than a AAA game. So you're always going to be at a disadvantage and struggling to buy new tanks/upgrades if you want to try and play even remotely close to Free to Play."
11520,"easy play, difference tank u can play (with effort)"
11521,Very Nice Game
11522,GG
11523,bruh
11524,+++
11525,"This is a nice game - when you can play it.

When I first started I was getting into battles quickly.  Encouraged, I invested in some premium time and bought some gold.  Now I cannot easily get a battle. 

Waiting for quarter of an hour and up is not on. 5 to 10 minutes of game time per hour is not on.

 Reading the forums I see this issue is not uncommon.

So ... no battles = no game = no recommendation.  Waste of time and if you buy from the store, waste of money."
11526,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO NEVER TOUCH THIS GAME. I have many complaints about Wargaming's business-model. You will notice it as soon as you get to tier 10 if you look closely. That is for another review tough, if I ever bother to spend time in this unbalanced game with a hideous developer in the future.

Moderators in this game behave like kids in terms of who they ban and what for.

THE MATCHMAKING ALGORITM does NOT work, I constantly (in more than 80% of my games) do more than twice the damage than the second highest damagedealer in my team. Sure the individual players can be blamed but there is a reason matchmaking qeue takes a very short time, most of your games will either end up  by your team crushing the other's or the other way around, no matter how well you play. As soon as you get to tier 5 or so you will feel this curse in more or less every game. You could spend your time in this game to get a tier 7 tank (or higher) and only play rated matches, those tend to be alot better matched, usually.

Summary: In my right mind I cannot recommend this game to anyone. And honestly, Wargaming has at least a few moderators they NEED to fire asap."
11527,"simple to play, nice graphics"
11528,б
11529,"THIS IS A VERY ADDICTIVE GAME, u should try it out :)"
11530,just download normal wot
11531,Best game ever despite salty players
11532,mmmppppsshhh ahhh
11533,game su cks       You are forced to pay money to get good tanks and are then put on teams with garbage players
11534,Only started playing because Steam gave me a $10 tank for  $.50. quickly realized if you arent a paying player or someone who has been playing long enough to receive the free best in tier tanks they give away to long term players you will not have fun. Noobs beware you will get 1-2 shot over and over and over again by little wiener sociopaths who can only play the kv-2 tank
11535,fast fun and easy to pick up.
11536,"it is fun, I have spent hours on this game and i find that the lower tier tanks  work best for me"
11537,I enjoy collecting tanks. There is alot about the gameplay I do not like as it favours platoons and weird styles of play that would never really work. I do love the tanks and mostly play to earn them or acquire them.
11538,Cuz its good the end
11539,"Great game, despite lacking in graphics department, it's astonishingly better than non-blitz counterpart"
11540,"the community is full of 75 IQ 15 year olds kids with anger problems, thats my review if you want to play with some retarded kids go ahead but expect toxicity in every match."
11541,"It is fun, it is a blast and yes it can have grinding moments.  However you get to drive Tanks and blow people up !  So that is a win win for me"
11542,good play nice AND smooth
11543,ОРПРП
11544,addictive
11545,Veru gud yes
11546,"I have told others about this game and all great things, i  have my son playing the game as well. I dont think the game should change anything,"
11547,"Fast and fun.
Community mostly good, just a few bad mouthed kids at times :-)
Support is very good."
11548,"the game has a few problems right now

1.balancing
the game has problems balancing premium tanks (collecting tanks) so that they perform equally well.
the hybrid nation is particularly affected by this.

2. server ping and loss
At the time of the last updates, the wargaming servers on the eu territoriom have deteriorated considerably and that is not only true for me but also for many others who play this game.

3.bad matchmaking
the matchmaking is currently very bad what the distribution of the four tank classes is in this game.
e.g. there are always 3 tank destroyers in every second battle on t10 if there were a maximum of 2 tank destroyers in one battle it would make a lot easier.

4.noobs or people who don't take an online game seriously
By far the biggest problem in this game the people have not experienced anything in the game but have to grind their way directly to the t10 tank, which I don't understand.
in my opinion there should be a separate matchmaking for people who have a wn8 of less than 1000 per month.
there would also be by far enough people on the shared servers to make this matchmaking possible.

5. wargaming on his side
I don't know why but wargaming builds stones in its own way and can't understand this.
e.g. there is an extra currency called gold we can buy it the fastest way with real money with this extra currency you can then buy premium tanks or collectible tanks against this system i have nothing to complain about but the problem is wargaming thinks it would be smart new tanks that apparently have not yet been adequately tested by the testers and then brought into the game for real money the problem with the whole thing is that wargaming is not able to nerf these tanks because they were sold for real money.
that's what happened to most tanks today, everyone thinks they are too strong, such as. the smasher and the annihilator.

6.crates
everyone pointed out the problem with boxes in this game you can get a tank out of the box with a lot of luck this probability is mostly around 3%.
for this motho represents a kind of gambling or is to be equated with it and one reason why wargaming is called wargambling.
and if you take a closer look we see that this game is marked with a fsk of 12 years and to play a game for children from 12 years of age is a very dangerous thing, in my opinion, an outrage.
and since wotb is a mobile game and is available in the playstore, children under the age of 12 will also receive this game and get to know this system, a system that should be marked from the age of 18.

I hope you can understand my rating and hope that you are better informed about this game.
if you found the rating good, give the rating a thumbs up so that more people see this rating."
11549,Yoo if u r looking for World War 2 game. I 3000% recommend this game. Been playing since 2014. And Joing Professional Tourny. Best Free-to-Play EVER!
11550,Guns of bullshit отдыхает. 12/10
11551,"Free game with high graphic for combat with many Tanks. Can play with friend via Platoon, Play Rank with in same server location."
11552,no because every time just like today when a new up date happens i cant play the dam game this time it loads the garage and as it starts to load my tanks crash !
11553,"NO ARTILLERY, 10/10"
11554,This game is probably on of the most interactive and fun games that I have played. Sure it can be frustrating when you're team is crap but is generally lots of fun.
11555,.
11556,Good game for who love tanks. Their still some thing need to improve in balance tanks in the game. Hope this game not become PC unbalance.
11557,
11558,cool game

11568,"do not spend money on this game  it is totally fixed.  you know as soon as you learn how fast the tanks can move.  nearly 100% tanks move measurably slower and that team always loses.  totally rigged totally fixed totally a rip off. and the pairing for teams - they put a bunch of over 50% winners against less than 50% winners - you can guess the outcome.  while in principle it is a fun game, don't plan on winning matches - except at the beginning.  They lure you in get you to spend money and then clean out your pockets to buy premium tanks for big bucks.  totally fixed and a rip off.  totally."
11569,it's a verry nice game!
11570,ist cool
11571,not bad
11572,I love the game
11573,nice game
11574,this game keep kicking me out when loading to the map and i get free reporting issue by other player that not because of me
11575,"This is the best game arcade tank, if you search a simulator or realistic game, it isn't recommended. I like this game because its cool game, the gameplay, graphic etc, but what I dont like from this game is, when I defeated, I got minus silver, even if I use premium account, and sometimes even if I win the game on high tier (7 up to 10) I still got minus silver, that's very annoying. Second, this game dont have a ""vs A.I mode"" for practice or maybe just want for fun. That's all, thank you"

11577,"Although this Game had issues at times with some latency;Over all it's fast exciting and most of the time a BLAST to play!
Of course any online game has it's ups and downs but the latency issue is by far the least.It's as always a select FEW who make this game frustrating at times.
13( with a PARENT SUPPOSEDLY MONITORING THEM)& up play on this and many a time you'll have that one player on your team that thinks they're the boss and will try to tell everyone what to do and HOW THEY SHOULD PLAY!??? 
I do my best to ignore this.I play as a TEAM MEMBER not a LEMMING!!! I help when needed but when I see everyone moving in the same direction,I'll go the other way or stand my ground and do my best to protect the team.
Fast match-ups of 7 members and 7 minutes matches! Make for a great and good battle most of the time. Servers for YOUR REGION if you play from say Asia and on the NA servers you'll not only affect your latency but those playing in the correct regions latency.
Love playing this in spite of it's FEW shortcomings!!! Have fun and Good Hunting."

11602,"With my limited experience, I can personally say that, even for mobile-to-PC port, this piece of electronic entertainment can be deemed as ""All right""."
11603,"It's a cool game to chill out and just have fun. not like the more demanding competitive games i usually play like CS-GO,,,PUBG.
I didn't think for one second when i got the tier 6 tank for 90 cents that i will enjoy the game this much.
forget to tell u that most of the times u don't have to pay to win.. i know paying will help u get to higher tier tanks faster but u can slowly get there don't rush it and just have fun."
11604,Pay2Win tanks every where Free tanks at the start are sh1t only fires 1 single shot while pay2win tanks you got a spam of shots and really fast reloading/driving speed.
11605,"This is a very cut down version with pre 1.0 graphics which fit phones, but not computers. There is no point in playing this on PC as the actual PC version has better graphics and an equally poor stock grind, but at least you can enjoy the graphics.

11620,"I am a World of tanks player and then to play Blitz its like relaxing with something cold, not so serious but still very good"
11621,"I'm addicted to this, I've been playing since before the steam release and here I am, 1200+ hours in, still playing.

Things I love: 

1) Variety of tanks, massive amount of tanks to choose from, all of them with their quirks and advantages.

2) Unpredictability of matches. This is what gives the game replay value. The game runs on a (fairly) effective matchmaking system where it (usually) matches you with people of your skill level, meaning matches are (usually) fair. Of course as you do better, it places you against better and better players, and with worse and worse players (who make you want to pull your hair out). 

Things I don't love:

1) The community: General rule of thumb (and I'm guilty of this too): the better the player the more toxic they are. My advice: ignore it and block them, people are dicks in online games, whats new?

2) The increasing amount of P2P: Face it, Premium tanks are better than most non-premium tanks (after all, they need to sell). Of course, this doesn't mean the you'll automatically be a better player, it just means that the tank is more annoying to deal with. That doesn't bother me, what bothers me is having events IMPOSSIBLE for F2P players to complete. Not hard. Impossible. This, as a long time vet, bothers me. Before all events had a period where gold, which can be easily (albeit slowly) obtained by F2P players by watching ads, could be used to complete stages. Recently, however, there has been no period for using gold to complete stages. Rewards are being locked behind a pay wall.

TLDR: Its great for casual play if your aren't bothered by a couple raging assholes, but if you want to be competitive, be ready to open that wallet for 100+ USD tanks."
11622,The game takes to much time from players to get the next level of tanks. I think it makes people boring quickly like me
11623,This Game Is So Nice
11624,"World of tanks blitz is an online battle game against tanks,This game is great Thank you for making this game."

11628,i just really like this game i dont know what to say
11629,"I wolud recimend this game to a lot of pepole
"
11630,"Like: matches are quick. Great for a short attention span or if you have things to do. The Tanks are fun, even the fake/cartoon tanks. The game could be really enjoyable if...

So many children on this game who toss out insults and bullying like its their hobby. I've heard ""nub"" way more on this game than anywhere else. If you're saying ""nub"" or something like that, you're admitting that  you're a twelve year old. Check with your parents if you aren't sure.

If you aren't getting harassed during the game, the game gives a player the option to harass you after a match. Of course you can block the players, but some of the children playing don't have very thick skin. Good god kiddo, it is just a game. So many kids believe they would win if it weren't for their awful team. Thank you, god's gift to WOT.  

Stop being a whiner and learn to cooperate. I've seen some of you log many many games. That's great, but maybe you should consider an after-school sport."
11631,This game is a joke. MM is off balance as well as shot mechanics

11643,For those that complain daily about the unfair match making and RNG is bag of dirt and to many noobs and what ever else floats ya boat you need your head testing i played this game on ipad got around 4k battles was doing absolutely terrible with around 46% WR but instead of doing the usual thing that everyone seems to be doing restarting i decided to try make it decent im now at 53.15 WR i know its not great but that in its self proves that the match making isnt that bad its just a bunch of immature salty kids/adults that think because they are in a 20-50 tonn monster they can rush in and kill everyone and come out the other side untouched..... pffft that will never happen no matter what tank you drive how you drive it you will always loose games not because of the match making but because theres better players out there better platoons out there ANYWAY my point is just enjoy the game for what it is and amazing work of art with spectacular tanks and sometimes great community

11660,love it
11661,"Dislike cost of replacement supplies. Like the ease of use and advances in technology employed within the game itself. Let's face it, it is a lot of fun, a distraction from every day living and a challenge !"
11662,nice game
11663,good yes
11664,"So I've been playing this game and World of Tanks in general since 2014~2015; I have to say that, aside from some powercreep issues, this game is very micro-balanced, fun and addicting. To even the most tiniest of curves on a ridge to make sure the spots you can set up on both sides are very specifically adjusted. Especially compared to the massive maps on the main PC version? You don't have so much space to have to cover when it comes to a map, so there is much more attention paid to the corridors, ridges, hills, choke points etc. ...

Moving on from that, the game is adjusted every update. some good changes some bad but for the most part they know what they're doing when they make changes.

I do NOT like the grinding aspect... The experience you need from tiers 7 to 9 are ridiculous from stock but it's doable. Players have been getting better all around but you still get the occasional toxic player or person who probably shouldn't have ever gotten up those tiers to begin with.

All in all I'd heavily recommend, especially if you get a friend to play it with"
11665,"Usual WOT type of game that rewards people that pay.
Same old poor match making system. Which then makes the game mechanics poor due to imbalance in matches. Tier1 has a better chance of not being so bad so long as all are at max upgrades and all T1 match with no T2 or others.
"
11666,Good game
11667,Good Game
11668,"The loot box bullshit is worse than what EA did, that shit should be impossible."
11669,"the only thing this game is great at is pissing you off, you will get a lot of toxic players insulting you for no reason and the game is extremely Pay-To-Win, literally everything in the game is bad, This is probably the most unfair PVP game i've ever played.

i can't believe i wasted 259.1 hours of my life on this mess, don't play the game before it makes you a cashcow."
11670,Pretty good for a free game 👍
11671,A very fun game also it is free.
11672,Great game overall. A couple big things to note though. The Community generally is very toxic. Like 9 year old CoD players screaming noob whenever they die from yoloing. That and the silly prices that Wargaming think they can charge for a tank. in some cases (more often than youd think) they try justifying £50 for a single tank. if you want to play this game be prepared to pay a little for it. other than that its a great game and worth playing.
11673,this game rocks!!!!!
11674,WoT blitz a is a great way of learning the name of ww2 and ww1 tanks the one thing i do have to say about the thing that is sucky is that there is ping and if your ping (connection) is bad you will either fly threw the air go under ground and  many other complications that are bad so i recomend this game if you have a pc or gaming pc either one works the graphics are designed  for ios and android hand held devices but the graphics are really good. so to sum it all up get the game if you have decent wi-fi and or pc or gaming pc
11675,good game i recomend it
11676,very fun can teach players how to play the PC (real game) version also no toxic arty

11690,"Tl;Dr 3/10, dont play Blitz unless you like feeling superior over under 16s players

Ive been a WoT veteran for many years with probably 3000-4000 hours time spent (maybe more) and a few thousand pounds dumped into the game too. My opinion of Blitz... its a travesty to put it simply. The fact that players on PC can ultimately dominate anyone using a tablet or god forbid a tiny screen android phone, simply due to easier controls with a mouse and keyboard and way faster targeting than a thumb/finger swiping across a screen is utterly absurd. I havent played Blitz for a few years now but from what i remember, and if the same trend has continued, Blitz exclusive premium tanks are for more wild, completely fictional and Pay2Win than you would find in the original WoT PC game, even the console versions which i also played.

Blitz is a game for the younger generations, its meant for kids who dont care for (some) historical accuracy, competitive play or fairness/balancing for that matter. Blitz, with all its horrid aspects is purely aimed for kids whos accounts are linked to their parents credit cards and the sheer unbalanced play of tablet/android screen vs keyboard and mouse, along with Pay2Win premium tanks and loot boxes which encourage gambling among younger generations, all these things should be enough for any serious gamer to steer well away from Blitz.

WoT original is far more enjoyable, better graphics with several game modes (some being monthly events year round) and far less kids playing, considering Blitz is easily accessible through the Play store on android and tablet. Though if WoT original isnt your option, War Chunder and Armored Warfare are also interesting tank games to play.

Wargaming can be a dodgy company at times, certain things they do seems like they give with one hand and take with the other, but WoT orignal is their game, and theyre taking care of it despite the certain things they do that seem like theyre trying to destroy their own game, which would be pretty dumb so thats not the case. However Blitz is the game they use to appeal to younger generations with the use of tablet or android which kids have more access to than fully fledged gaming PCs, and the loot boxes are just one sign that shows that Blitz is nothing but a game purely to make money, rather than fill a niche in the market."
11691,"Very Nice, I especially like that the battles are so quick. its an excellent mid week night game."
11692,"Great shooting game with a lot of action. Teamwork and strategy needed to work together and win.

edit: 2021:

The game is extremely unbalanced due to tanks like annihilator that are owned by a lot of players. Even tho WG could nerf Annihilator since they also nerfed lower tiers back in the day, yet their not doing it. saying its 'balanced'. basically everything above tier 5 is just one big issue considering the matchmaking.

Annother issue is unstable servers. I play on the EU server and get constant fps loss/frozen screen/ ping spikes and my game often crashes for absolutely no reason(i have the best possible connection and dont experience any problems like this in any other game)

the game is for free, but its very easy to start to spend money on the game. crates are very addictive."
11693,"I find this better than WOT PC in terms of MM and no arty. If u want games to be less pressuring, this one is definitely the go but, Grinding is hard and long, economy is shit unless u have a premium tank with you (go check the DLC with Stridsvagen 74A2 along with -95% discount coupon), Try not to go tier 8 if u have credit issue. I suggest the Chi Nu for credit farming if u refuse to purchase in game products"
11694,"I like the game but its pay to win and you have to invest a lot of time to get even one tier X not speaking about all the tier X in the game otherwise its fun you can get really good if you play it a lot, knowing the maps and the armor layout just makes you op!"
11695,fun
11696,DIS GAME DE BOMB!!! I love it! even though i'm not the best. IT STILL FUN
11697,"A good game, but be ready to max out at level 7 if playing for free unless you like the long grind."

11716,"It's a great game, plenty of fun! played for 3 hours and didnt die once, then as i started really ranking up i was being matched with higher tier players and getting destroyed before i could think, so there's that, my only quibble is that once you get rank 5 tanks, the matching gets loosely based on tier so you can get killed in one shot while it takes 5 shots to kill an enemy, other then that its a great game!"

11748,Great game. Worth a try really.
11749,"Free to play; pay to move up quicker. The grind is sometimes tedious, but you get experience by grinding rather than just paying. Pick your premiums and get some nice tanks. Teams are random and sometimes not so good."
11750,Lots of fun
11751,"Mobile version of World of Tanks, Very fun game if you can get past the toxic people, but those are in every online game, other players are fine, others great. I enjoy playing the game, playing mechanics are good, there are some things that are annoying sometimes but still worth playing, games start quick, 7 vs 7, and are over quick, which I enjoy, love that you can make your own clan, and the system is incorporated into the game which is cool, you can grind tanks without paying money but having some money to get some premium tanks is best, especially for grinding credits, they make more coins then most tech tree tanks, overall fun game."

Often time, players venture away from the team only to get killed by 2 or more of the opposing force.

11791,It's a simplified version of regular WOT. There's enough advertising of ingame stuff to buy. Sometimes the discounts are alright including the 12000 gold offer for $4.99 the trick being you only get 1600 up front then you need to log in everyday for 14 days getting awarded 800 gold per day until your given 12000 gold.

"
11793,is nice
11794,Pretty much the same as the official WOT but simplified for our convienence. its a great game if your low on space or internet bandwidth.
11795,fun to play!
11796,Amazing game combined this with my mobile account have 10 X tanks would recommend
11797,It is a good game even if you enjoy Russian bias
11798,"Its really smooth and fun to play while still being challenging !

very good"
11799,"Классная игрушка, для тех кто любит танки"
11800,"дерьмо донатное,без према  неиграбельно. А если вы шейх, то все равно игра не принесет удовольствие из-за не великовозрастных игроков. да и вообще аудитория у этой игры гнилая. наверно хуже чем у доты."
11801,naaah
11802,"one of my favorite games can play on pc and mobile very versitle!
"
11803,"its German bias but not German bias enough....
:<<"
11804,Super grindy lmao
11805,great game but kinda need to be a premium member at tier 6 to continue to earn money without boosts
11806,Hard to turn off once you start playing.
11807,"WOTB is fast past compared to WOT and easy to run on almost any pc


(2022/03/10) i started playing again because i got bored and now i only get monkey teammates"
11808,It's fun... the premium tanks aren't as great as they sound when advertised though.
11809,dddd
11810,"just ace ... hard work to get the upgrades... but it gets you to learn each tanks pluses and minuses..
great work ...thanks WOT."
11811,123
11812,gyi
11813,I've been playing this game for a long time and it is awesome. Just remember to play with friends as it makes it way more fun.
11814,its a fun game
11815,Fun to play with friends.
11816,I love this game
11817,too much RnG pls nerf premium tank...
11818,"Way more fun than it looks with enough experience. Game has quite a bit of strategy actually with 4 different classes, crew tree, & equipment for every tank. There are 10 tiers for tanks from I to X. Although it gets supremely grindy after tier VII, if you save up gold from ads on the mobile version, you can get a premium vehicle without actually spending any money. Premium vehicles are quite controversial but tbh, they're only very slightly better than non-premium vehicles stats-wise. But they do earn credits extremely quickly, and credits are nice. If you play really well with a non premium tank, you can expect 10-30k credits per game at tier V. With a premium, that's more like 30-50k. That's it though, after that you can grind really fun tank lines on the tech tree. Want a slow but broken WWII bomber on wheels that one shots anything below its tier? Go for the KV-2. Want to have a gun which shoots literal needles that obliterate even the thickest of armor? Go for the Nashorn. Want to drive faster than enemy turrets can turn and make Bugattis around the world weep in jealosy? Go for the french light tanks. I'm still at tier VI and grinding to get to tier X but the progression system keeps me hooked and that's why I think this game is awesome despite some of its flaws."
11819,This is Game KONTOL ANJING
11820,Cимулятор боли который мы заслужили.100 взорванных БК из 10
11821,this game is awsome
11822,yeah
11823,its fun i guess.
11824,Great Game
11825,I think this game will be loved
11826,"Matchmaking in this game is atrocious. Constantly paired up with higher level tanks, Obviously trying to entice you to pay real money to skip the grind. And what a grind it is. If you're not willing to pay, be prepared to be Tier locked with Inferior tanks which often cant even damage your enemies."
11827,"This game is a vast improvement over World of Tanks PC, the game is far more balanced and dynamic. I would even go as far to say that is the best game that Wargaming has developed"
11828,It's a genuinely fun game that you can play for hours without realizing it.  The graphics and depth of content make it one of my favorite games.
11829,AWESOME TANK GAME EVER!
11830,best game
11831,"Super fun, and so many tanks. You can upgrade tracks, turrets, guns, and engines on many tanks. I wish they would keep the realistic mode though. One of the best modes they came up with."
11832,"Yes and maybe...not. This game is not as competitive as you would think. Because ""random match"" is literally and completely random except for the types of tanks; therefore, it can be sucked. Also some tanks are slightly over powered, and the worst part is, those tanks are usually premium tanks so you cannot get it without paying money for this game. Also, aiming for high Tier tanks in this game can be very exhausting and stressful for guns and engines for some tanks have absurdly low penetration or low power. In order not to experience such inconvenience, you need to patiently save your Free EXP which you can get less than 100 every game. Considering you need at least need 50~70k EXP to unlock ""each"" modules, it requires much commitment or some real money to boost.
Positive sides are; It works on low-spec PC like mac book air; This is free but is well-developed; with knowledge of armor specs, weak points, and effective use of terrain you can pretty much out play the other players; it's really fun to grind for new tanks especially you like that tank; there are decent amount of events that you can get free tanks, premium accounts, gold, and some more.  I can say that this game requires decent technique unlike some other games where you can just spam one move and wins every time. But again, there are some unbalanced tanks out there and grinding is time consuming. I personally love this game and for that love I recommend people to install this game, however, I also think people deserve a truth. So I wrote this review."
11833,boring
11834,"Good game, fast exping tanks. Better then classic WOT"
11835,"Love the game.

I wish it was more optimized tho, the Steam version.

edit: bad game"
11836,"It's a fun BUT the match maker sets u up with players that don't know the first thing about tanks. i recommend this game for all tank lovers and if you get this game, focus on the enemy tanks you CAN pen."
11837,lacks graphics and effects but is really nice to play with a beautifully balanced tanks and wide variety of stuff to research ...
11838,Well balanced game... I keep coming back because it takes an incredible amount of skill. You can always improve. It's not brainless like some other games I've played.
11839,"you dont really need to pay to enjoy the game, nice"
11840,Best game!
11841,"This game is like a crack addiction, without all the health benefits of crack"
11842,one of the games that have no bugs and good matchmaking .
11843,servers are too weak...
11844,great to take your mind off todays problems
11845,Very good
11846,"Always loved tanks since I can remember.  Used to have pewter models, then the Revel ones.  Made scenerios of various actions, et al.  WoT lets me drive and battle with other players from around the world.  Quite the challenge.  Some of the holiday stuff is questionable though.  I'm not much for holidays like halloween or thanksgiving, considering it requires the family to be there and we're rather spread out.  The decos don't really help with the combat."
11847,"Ive played for 3 years and enjoy it for the most part,and keep coming back!"
11848,i find this game for quick matches and historically accurate vehicles plus well thought up sci-fi vehicles.
11849,"great game
"
11850,discount war thunder
11851,Best + no comment
11852,the game is good but they need to make a server for anyone under 18 so the older players can play the game like it used to be
11853,matchmaker suck
11854,hard bad nice
11855,Its a Good Game Guys Join and Enjoy
11856,"I liked spending $1,000 for a tank that I never got and still don't have."
11857,It is very OHUENNAYA IGRA NAHUY
11858,aaaa
11859,trash
11860,Game has become a win my cheat or by buying the best tank its loosing its fun element really shame was a great game. WOW say it cant be broken which is crap you only have to see the game in full swing to know it has been. aim bots and sweet spots should be there logo. still enjoy it sometimes but just avoid playing when the yanks and cheats are on
11861,"Fun to play, but beware: it's very pay to win."
11862,very good game i am fully recomending it to you all so you can drive the best tanks out there (the british ones)
11863,"WoTB is a great mobile FPS with amazing tanks. It is 7-on-7 in Blitz version with about 5 minute battles. If you want larger battles and longer times then get the non-Blitz , non-mobile version of WoT. I also play their WoWS game (War Ships) from time to time but prefer Tanks. You can get WoT-Blitz from Windows store (crashes on my laptop) or here in Steam store (stable on my laptop). I also like the Steam store for a more secure way to buy premium time or materials. Enjoy!"
11864,Good game for beginners. Easy learning curve.
11865,overall solid game for a free one
11866,Great fast paced tank game
11867,"nicenicenicenice
"
11868,"Free to play... you can have fun with the free to play versions... obviously those who are able to buy into it will have a significant advantage but I have sunk over 100 hours into this as it is a quick pick up and play. Most rounds will last of the order of up to 5 mins. It is not the end of the world if I have to duck out of a match to attend to family matters unlike, say, a FPS, so I like this as a bit of a relaxing game when I have a short amount of time here and there."
11869,is good to fk WG xD
11870,super game
11871,Good game but toxic community
11872,"Light-weight, competitive and intense multiplayer. Perfect game for those (like me) who cannot sit through a competitive match of 40-60 minutes anymore because of other time-consuming obligations. A regular match is around 4-5 minutes, and the time cap of a match is 7 minutes. 10/10."
11873,nice games
11874,"It is an actual mobile game

u're not playing this game coz u found one of this, u're not also playing this game just because its better then another tank shooter game. This game, compared to another tank shooter game is bad, so bad.

But if u once enjoying this game coz u're playing this game on ur mobile, it is good. It is a mobile game that launched in steam, and made playable for PC.

For me it's fun, just because I used to enjoy this game with my phone, then try it out in PC, its a full grinding, pay to win, and I can't even say competitive, even if there is a tournament for this game, but for the normal matchmaking, it's not competitive. But more of those negative thing, I still enjoy it.

If u want to play this game, try out the mobile 1st, then come to this game. If u just looking for the best PC tank shooter, this game is not even close to that, or if ur PC is a piece of a potato, this game might be for u."
11875,surely this game is great for those who loves armored vehicles
11876,"Nice and quick battles and doesnt take as much to learn as the full WoT.

Edit:

Well after years of playing this, I have now deleted my Wargaming Account because, being of Ukrainian Heritage I can't being my self to support a Russian/Belarus company while Ukraine Burns."
11877,more custom game needed for refresh
11878,just like this game
11879,"I love the realistic feel of this tank on tank warfare
"
11880,Great game to play when trying to take breaks from other games. Not really something I'd play full time.
11881,Amazing game
11882,"It is a well put together game, that works well and has a nice balance between tanks and others, there are some problems here and there for non-active players like, credits(money in game) its just really hard to get it for like Tier X(10) its 6 million +. It does need some balance but they will fix that in the future. Some important part to know, read the WHOLE stat page of the tank before deciding what to do"
11883,cool
11884,"no arty :)
"
11885,An awesome way to commandeer one of the most iconic tanks in history and go kaboom all the way!
11886,cool game best tank game ever
11887,I mean it's fun but it's becoming more and more pay to win evreyday and it's just getting sorta bland because of that.
11888,This game is fun you should play it
11889,fricken epic
11890,"fun game, quite grindy though"
11891,"To quote a wise man: This game isn't free, it costs a little bit of your sanity every time you play."
11892,great game
11893,"Very fun game to play and much easier to get to higher tiers then PC version i feel the game is alot more balanced and all honestly more, the graphics may not be a good as PC but the gameplay is better, also the only problem with this game the use of Fantasy tanks which i have to admit really annoy me to how powerful they are!"
11894,"It's a good game if you want to have fun. Once you get to higher tiers, you either have to pay some money for premium account that gives you 50% more credits and XP for the game to still be enjoyable or you have to make some huge sacrifices to still make a profit. Overall it's a good game considering it's free.
"
11895,k
11896,tank game
11897,It is fun and free to play. You learn a lot about tanks. You kill other tanks. You get blown up.   Some people say bad things to me. The prizes in the crates are too expensive. There is too much marketing.
11898,"typical pay 4 win system in two ways: direct - you can buy stuff which help u to win, and indirect - if you dont pay then you will fight in worst team and earn less xp. i played multiple hours in mobile version and compare skills and stats with 50 members team. secondly there are very toxic community"
11899,this game is addictive and once you get up to  teir 5-7 its actually fun
11900,Hetzer very shitty
11901,"This game is super fun. It might seem a little slow at points, but Wargaming keeps things interesting with seasonal events. Battles are fair (most of the time) and there is very little hazing done in-game. overall great game with great mechanics. 4.5 stars out of 5."
11902,"Lots of fun...frustrating at times, but fun. The powers that be keep changing tank stats. They also eliminated tanks from my garage. Pseudo physics. Line of sight establishment not always necessary, and don't worry about gun/cannon length when turning through your enemy or building....never any damage to your gun. No specific gun or crew damage when ramming either. The powers that be do not take into account # of battles fought as part of the experience profile. The worst was a 6.8 battles to 1 as a team. Slaughter was an understatement. When this happens (and more often than I care to think about) the other team has a better handle on game controls, the map(finite # of them) and tactics. THAT BEING SAID....it is still my favorite game! I still spit & sputter over the inequities..........but I still keep playing....and loving it!"
11903,look at my hours played and decide. I dont spend money in games I work for what i want.
11904,"Im a millitary history buff, so to me its just really cool to just use some of the tanks you read about and just sorta get a feel for them, 
"
11905,"Its a pretty good game, and the only problem is how expensive the premium tanks are. Other than that it has good gameplay and graphics."
11906,cool
11907,If you love tanks this is the game that you would like :D
11908,Good game just gets boring fast
11909,"cash can only get you so far, paid tanks are no better than tanks you can get by playing"
11910,So good !
11911,wow and a wow this game is amazing no joke before it is ok now to a 1 into 10
11912,While i enjoy the game and find the game mechanic to be awesome the down side of this game is the terrible matchmaking where you will most probably be paired up with noobs or better yet players with not the same skill cap where you will struggle to find any sort of co operations or sense in what the fuck your teammate is doing.... also this is a wallet warriors game pay to win bitches....... utterly dissapointed good idea very good execution bullshit matchmaking
11913,Hours of fun.
11914,
11915,I like the short sharp battles
11916,saved my life for 1 years :)
11917,"Great game
But match making is rigged sometimes"
11918,"Game is absolutely amazing, played over 800 hours and still love it. 10/10"
11919,"After my time in this game (significantly longer as I used to play on mobile), I have decided that it is, well, good fun.
I enjoy the variability and adaptability of each battle, and the different ways different tanks play. I haven't payed a cent and feel as though I'm on a reasonably level playing field. Yes, there are a few overpowered premium vehicles, but the most of them are balanced.
Balancing is mostly good, and most of the players are reasonably courteous. The rest are fun to laugh at.
Great fun for one or two, and tournaments are adrenaline pumping romps. Interesting and unique game style for the processing power required, and the team element is fun regardless of whether you are carried, or carrying.
Some of the best moments in (low processing) gaming arise when you carry a team to victory, or win when outnumbered 3-1.
The only mobile game I've ever played for any length of time, and holds up even better on PC. A great alternative to WOT PC version for when you want to destroy mobile players with your mouse, or when you don't have much time.
The grind takes a while, beware, so don't worry too much about reaching tier 10. I find some of the most fun tanks are at tiers 6/8. (Bear in mind I haven't played tier 10 yet, and only have stock tier 9s).
Enjoy!"
11920,gameplay good
11921,I do not believe all the vehicles in this game are balanced! Like the Leopard which is vastly over-rated for a 30 mm cannon armed fighting vehicle! And this afv being replaced by the Panther before it even hit production. I think the Panther should be even greater. 30 mm shells should find their place bouncing of most if not all HT armor. I think there is bias in many tanks! - The only gun I have heard of that puts it's shell in the same spot every time to effect destruction is the Bren gun believe it or not!
11922,"Its better than WOT PC, but its still a WG title..."
11923,Love this game!
11924,please check it out.
11925,"very excellent and funny game, i like it"
11926,eh P2W and its no longer fun fuck this game
11927,"i like it, dont suck my dick please"
11928,"enjoying the current benefits and awards being offered for this Hallow- een season

11929,"the player have the option of play without paying anything, have a lot of fun, it looks like the game don't have any server in south america, so the ping stay high in the most of time."
11930,Great strategic shooter that is fair to and fun for even free players.
11931,"Constant updates help keep the game fresh and new

11934,THE GAME PLAY IS SMOOTH BUT THE VARIOUS OPTIONS FOR AWARDS AND EXTRAS NEEDS TO BE BETTER EXPLAINED.

-Tanks in every order (I - X)
-Few ""Classes"" (TD/Heavy/Light/medium)
-No Artillery
-Getting Occasionally premium tanks for free (need to play enough to get them)

What i dislike:
- mostly, just my ☼ intelligent ☼ teammates"
11936,"GOOD ALL ROUND GAME,I WOULD LIKE TO SPEND LESS BUT YOU DONT GET ANYWHERE IF YOU DONT SPEND.......I WOULD RECOMEND TO MY MATES"
11937,I have played this game for years and throughout the ups and downs I still love it
11938,"its good
"
11939,"Its fun, quick, and and well designed, I couldn't ask for a better game"
11940,"The game isn't perfect and does suffer from a few trolls, which is an issue everywhere, but it plays well, and best of all is supported natively on the MacOS platform.

You will need to spend time on it and learning about the individual maps AND  all the tanks you are likely to play against to really excel; I'm still a novice.  Also unless you make friends and platoon, you are at the mercy of their matchmaker as to who your team-mates are.  Platoons play together.  Some random teams can be great, others can be pretty bad.  Luck of the draw.

It is very easy to spend real money, especially on the better ammo for the tanks or 'gambling' on crates.  You need to watch yourself or this free to play game will start costing real money.  You _can_ have fun without paying but it will definitely slow your progress.

I'm on a late 2013 Macbook Pro 15"" and it runs great."

11942,"The game is fun to play, but there are alot of mean players/noob haters...

Don't mind me, im not a socialiseable type of guy xD... and im bad at writing this... LOL :V"
11943,Cool game
11944,i can say it is better than the classic WoT :D
11945,"i want more lines for japanese tech tree,nerf the smasher and other op tanks"
11946,It is competitive yet fun. You don't need to be a serious gamer to enjoy. it is a touch slower paced than traditional 1st person shooters. Underlines the value of teamwork. its 100% free and runs on 100% well maintained servers. It has much faster load times and match making times than normal World of Tanks. With my beast PC i still recommend WOT Blitz over standard WOT.
11947,its fun
11948,"It's a decently well made game with a nice variety of tanks from multiple countries during late WWII-1960's ish era. It might take awhile to get to mid tier tanks, but it's worth the effort eventually. The game gets updated quite often, so that's a bonus. Only issue with the game is how damage works/how penetration is shown/calculated. 

I'd still recommend it to anyone looking for a decently fun tank game."
11949,"It's a pay to win and if you want the really fancy tanks you have to pay or grind to get them. That aside it's still fun to play and fairly easy to get into from the start as you try to choose the path to which tanks you want to get.  

Definitely worth the try if you curious at the very least."
11950,perfect
11951,Lots of cheating but I have learned to ignore that and enjoy the play.
11952,"Pretty fun and fast gameplay. Sure it's a nig damn moneygrab, but eh. For those that only want to play a few rounds, and make a apuse, it's prefecto."
11953,Awsome gameplay ... graphix not so good but very good controls and a large variety of tanks in game from ww2 to enjoy ! also u can progress without the use of $  enjoy the game !
11954,good game i like it
11955,"I like this game and can play it for hours......HOWEVER, it is not a ""free to play"" game.  If you don't spend real money in the game, they lock you out of the queue and you can't play.  If you have lots of money to spend on this game....yes, I would recommend it. So, because of the cost factor I give it an overwhelming NO."

11975,nice game
11976,"This game has its ups and downs, but here's my review for it.
Pros:
Good change in pace, not ultra fast paced like FPS games, but not too slow of a pace either.
High variety in team structure and tank playstyles (every tank is different).
Good special events.
Cons:
High pay to win
Grind for higher tiers is a virtual nightmare if you have any less than a 50 percent win rate
Many P2W exclusive tanks that outperform their non-premium counterparts.
Score: 7/10- A good game, although only because its free."

11981,"Its just an overall fun game to play, addictive too.."
11982,"You should play this game because it's ftp, and there are so many tanks, but once you get to tier four, you get stuck a bit, then at tier seven, you get stuck again, but, other than that, IT'S GREAT!"
11983,I enjoy the game even though I am not good at it. One annoying point is that some of the in game offers are not value for money: I have dumped a tank I have bought after a few uses because it did not live up to the hype.
11984,"Good graphics, good tanks, good players. most played steam game for me
"
11985,"It's a game that is easy to learn and difficult to master, but when one wins, the feeling is incomparable.  Good teamwork is everything.  It can be frustrating to lose (a LOT!) but at the same time, it's challenging and as good a way to kill time as any.  I recommend it....but be prepared to put in a ton of hours working your way to a Tier 10 tank....."

11990,I just don't like it. That's all.
11991,"Don't, just don't!"
11992,"Fun game, easy to pick up but sometimes the grind is annoying and people who pay have an advantage, despite that. It's a fun game worth spending time on.
"
11993,"If you seek Historic tank gameplay, this was the game, Now they have created fantasy tanks and fantasy games in the last month. I assure you some like it very much, but if you are in it to play historic tanks, this game will not meet your expectations. The matchmaker is terrible, I have witnessed many more shutouts than I ever did in WOT. 

The good- The game is free to play but it will take you longer to progress, and only paying players can get the better tanks. Ig you buy premium and play standard tanks, you will be on tums and rolaids within a month."
11994,Its aite
11995,"This game is amazing, there are many varietys of tanks  and different countrys. There are also many beautiful maps. The upgrading system is easy and straight to the point, and the different types of consumables adds more to the battle. Another thing is the controls, the controls are very simple with a simple tutorial. I would reccommend this game if you like tanks that blow up other tanks, you'll like this."
11996,"stock tanks are horribly bad,, and ensures your early games with it will be an absolute nightmare. Matchmaking is also horribly unbalanced,, Premium tanks outperform standard tanks in almost all aspects, thus making it pay2win.


it has this lootboxes, which is actually a good thing, since it contains boosters, credits, gold and sometimes even premium tanks
but that isn't enough to save this unbalanced game

if you still want to play this garbo,, go play the Standard PC version, albeit it still hosts the same problems as this one."
11997,this is the peepis game
11998,IT KICKS ASS
11999,DAM GOOD GAME STILL NEED SOME WORK IN GAME AN PRICE FOR TANKS TOO HIGH
12000,"Fast, Fun and Furious"
12001,its alright
12002,This is a shitty mobile port of a not terribly fun tank game.
12003,You can't play this game and be happy and have fun at the same time. No one cares about it's graphics or voices. It's about the bad gameplay and the fact the you need to wait before you can shoot. Plust that you can't skip the tutorial everytime you choose a region or account or whatever. Also when finish that and play you are forced to play with one slow tank that is bad.
12004,"this game is fucking disgusting, u get fucked by 3 shots and you cant even move, you cant hit, you cant do any shit and this game is fucking stupid af

10/10 would fuck this game"

12006,"Its a great action game with a appreciable and sensical tactical strategy layer. There is a multitude of tanks with varying stats, abilities and play styles to keep you going for a long time. You can easily get into the game without paying a dime, and although there are certainly some vehicles that are OP, there are ways to counter them, usually you get similar players on your team and they are often rare. I've been playing it for year, with some breaks here and there, and still find it quite enjoyable on a daily basis. There are also great events several times a year where many free vehicle and other bonuses are given just for playing and are entirely obtainable. Overall, an excellent game of its category and is generally well maintained, especially considering it is F2P."
12007,Good for LIDL devices
12008,"Sometimes i just feel, it is really pay to win..
Just please, play with the regular World of Tanks..
Why is this version worse than the original??
-no artillery tanks
-worse graphics
-less content
-less fun

+pay to win"
12009,the worst game i had ever play . if you have money you can win 100% and the game need 7 player team work together and if one of them made mistake you will loss bitch!
12010,"I Have been playing this game for months on end, I do definitely recommend it to others but I will say although it is a fun game and well balanced in most instances, a lot of situations were you are put into a match with a higher tier which is very common it is quite hard to succeed in anyway. Especially in instances with higher tiers.  And for those who can deal with a bit of repitition as the high tiers are excessively grindy even with paying for monthly premium time. So in Short, this game can be really fun and normally players are quite social but you also have to be prepared for a lot of grinding your way up and the occasional tank that is absolutely terrible in a Tank line. You must also be a versatile player as some vehicles you can play aggressively and deflect shells like theres no tommorow, and others you might have to sneak around and strategize as getting one shot is definitely possible from absolute monsters like the Iconic KV-2 and SU-152. Another thing is to be careful what premium tank you buy as it may be so bad you'll rage while playing it, and wonder why you bought it in the first place."
12011,Small battles between Many different levels & Types of Armor in various locations and difficulty.
12012,"This is fun
"
12013,"p2w, lootboxes, toxic community etc."
12014,"Nice game. Not many problems, lots of events. Smasher is fckg broken, but not thaaaaaaat much. Can improve. But it is fine"

12016,play
12017,"When I using level III tank, I'm match with a team of 2 level III tank and with the rest level IV tank. When I using level IV tank, I'm match with 2 level IV tank with the rest level V tank. WTF is this? There is 20+ same level with me in the queue and I have to match with a team with majority of the tanks are a level higher than me. And I don't even get bonus reward for fighting the match."
12018,"Really fun.  Lots of grinding But enjoyable

12021,"If I could connect my Wargaming account in World of Tanks to Steam, then people could see that I have played this game for thousands of hours. I have had times where I took a break from the game, but in the end I always returned to my tanks [b](RIP the T-50-2, forever in my heart)[/b].

In this review I could have told you some things about the game mechanics and what makes it interesting to play, but I'm sure some people have already done that.
I'm only writing this review in hope of Wargaming choosing to make it possible to play World of Tanks over Steam. The reason is that I apparently can't open up World of Tanks anymore without the game crashing (that's also the only reason I'm playing Blitz), so I hoped perhaps it would work out if the game got connected to Steam?

Regards, a hopeful Wargaming Veteran."
12022,cancer game but after 1.3k hours (ON STEAM) i just can't stop playing it.
12023,+
12024,Awesome game but it can't seem 2 recognize me even though I'm signed in 2 other places..
12025,i love this game
12026,It's still a fun game as always o_o)7
12027,"If you like a simple tank game and blowing up enemies, this is it. Small learning curve, quick matches."
12028,It is very cool but PLEASE add the normal version for computer on steam!
12029,casual
12030,Nice game really but if you want to win you got to pay$$$$$$
12031,"Very good graphics and many tanks to choose from. I like how there are many different camouflage mostly the special skins for those specific tanks which is even BETTER!!! Overall good maps and most of all the new halloween game mode ""Uprising"" with all these COOL abilities, my favorite is the double shot.

EDIT:The bad thing about the ""Uprising"" game mode is that if you lose you lose ALOT of money and its annoying too!"
12032,"why i cant play it on my laptop
need answer"
12033,"I play this on mobile, and alot of the pay to win bullshit stuff is also on the normal pc version and worst to an extent. I have over 17k battles on the normal pc version, player name is jjia feel free to look it up. Blitz improves on the pc version of World of Tanks in almost every way. Game play is improved through the lack of arty. The smaller teams allow for more room to flank and move, no more stupid COD style 3 lane maps. The blitz dev's have fixed premium ammo spam by making it do less damage in exchange for more penetration. The larger health pools and slower time to kill along with a better economy allows you to be more aggressive, where as on the normal pc version games after tier 7 often devolve into camp fests. Lack of mod support means you don't have bullshit cheats like aimbots and hitzone skins. Now if you've never played World of Tanks all of what I just said will sound like nonsense, just know this is better in many ways then the normal pc version"
12034,"[h1]Nice to play with a friend.[/h1] 
To play well you need to learn maps and tanks stats, basic tactics of engage with four types of tanks.
7 vs 7 very fast matchmaking and battles.

I recommend this game if you like tanks and don't have a powerful PC."

12045,"poor knock off of warthunder, worse feeling tanks and a cheap feel."
12046,"This game had great potential until the developers thought it was a good idea to bring gambling system into their game. A 10 $ lootbox with a ""2.5%"" drop chance of the winning prize, no thanks. Plus a toxic community full of brain dead adults or kids learning their new swear words.

If I am able to save a few players from starting with this game, then I am happy. The longer you play, the more you wonder why you even started. This game serves no purpose and it has no end goal.

Don't start while you can."
12047,"Literally a mobile game ported to PC, including the Pay-2-Win microtransactions. I don't need to say any more about it."

12051,Not Bad

12053,"Played this many hundreds of hours before on mobile, very good for time pass online quick matches. Very costly premium features are annoying....but well I do pick this game up for some days again after getting frustrated and quitting. Takes very long to grind up a tank without premium which can be frustrating. Overall good, but annoying for a broke gamer like me."
12054,"great game need improve  match making by win rate 
"
12055,This is a shity mobile port and it shows the graphics are awful and it’s massively pay to win
12056,"Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone. You progress quite quickly through the game so money doesn't have to be spent unless you're really desperate. However, the biggest problem is the match making. You either smash their team or get smashed. You can be afk on your team and win with maybe one casualty or work your ♥♥♥ off and lose awfully. This can be fixed on future updates but apart from that, it's a solid game. Also, you can run it on a potato or an Apple so that's always good."
12057,ey holmes dont u disrespect me like that holmes

12060,so i downloaded this game after seeing an ad on a warthunder video and played the EULA screen for 5  minutes to say that wargaming is garbage.
12061,"Its a good fun game, Just dont exspect to much.... As most of these games.. You get a tank and eager goes to battle and trow you into batle... While the exspirenced players in stronger tanks.. Keeps out of harms way patiently waiting you got damaged some enimoes and then when its suitable they pop up and on end of batle and clean up and take all the points and exspirence... 
Coverly, but for some all count..... Still I have fun play and die fast :D"
12062,"The game is a pathetic example of the current ""F2P"" that is just pay-to-win. The game devs are just a buncha mooks. They create tanks that have so much armour so you cannot hit it. They create fantasy tanks that are so far superior to regular tanks. They give you avatars that do ABSOLUTELY nothing, beside being a worthless avatar.

If i saw the game devs on fire in the streets I would run to help the fire with a drum of gasoline."
12063,"Fun to play once in a while. Technically it isn't very robust, lots of quirks to graphics and game play. One gets the sense these quirks are deliberate in the way the game is marketed to make money. 

Could be MUCH better. 

Would never invest a dime, but fun to play a few rounds here and there."
12064,The most obious rip off ever - you dont pay cold hard cash? Too bd matey - you will be thrown into a battle against tanks your shitty ironcoffin cannot even dream to penetrate. Well in fact scratching a paint  Avoid at any cost!!!

12066,Dead game

12068,It's a really good online multiplayer game one of a kind
12069,"This game had huge potential - but dev. make it a pay-to-win game.. 60-90$ for a tank gold making tank, and like 15 $ for a crate with 2-3 % drop chance for a good/op tank... get real devs..."
12070,"so i was excited to play this game when i saw the french was added, but after the tutorial i tried to add my friend to find out that he was not on the server i was on, so i checked and, sure enough i was on asia for some reason (i live in north america). so i had to switch servers and i lost ALL dlc i had gotten on the one server, making it pointless to play the french tank i just bought. thanks for stealing 10 whole dollars world of tanks, hope it makes you happy."
12071,Does not work with macOS Catalina
12072,"The reason why you want to ditch WOT PC and play WOT Blitz, Arta, there's no Arta, no stupid stunning, no skyshit fapping on you for the entirety of the battle, also no wheeled vehicles that spots my shitbarn 20seconds into battle and gets penned by 3 artas for all my HP."

12078,"First few matches in and you'll feel like you're pretty good at it. Then, you'll start losing battles and there's no way you're gonna get how to play anymore. I even bought a DLC for this game and now I regret it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME. The worst thing is that the team members aren't cooperative. How am I supposed to play if the team members do not communicate??????"
12079,Lovely game!
12080,Good game lol
12081,Uninstalled from steam without me doing it??  Hoping I did not lose all the tanks I had to buy.  Hmmmm
12082,Good for what it is but controls are kind of strange.
12083,"Quick Note: Play this game if ur ready to buy at least one premium tank and know the steep learning curve and survive the community (good and bad) and to not rage after facing OP tanks.

In a nutshell (a big one): 
Gameplay is fun since the mechanics are simple but hard to master (especially in platoons and tourneys if you find a good team and coordination).
Problem is....Tutorial is awful so you get lots of noobs (they don't explain gun stats, armor and angling, and PLEASE EXPLAIN CAMO)
Oh and the matchmaking is 50/50, sometimes its really fun, sometimes you steam roll enemies or get absolutely rekt by unicums.

Community is both good and bad (platoon for lols and tourney for fun but you get salts in randoms)
Youtuber Contributors are great at supporting the community which is definitely better than mods.
Official Discord server is terrible (criticize the game and u get send to the gulag or in this case, muted/banned).
The Content and maps are plentiful.

Tank balances is 75% fine but the problem is the other 25% are quite common (WZ,Smasher,Lupus,another WZ, list goes on)
How broken? Way better stats while having not much drawbacks.
Oh and it's 90% OP tanks are premium so yeah
At least tier 10 is really nicely balanced until wg drops on badger

Lastly
Screw those crates, rng fest, useless, why people buy these?

Special Thanks to: 
Youtubers: Sk8trm, Bushka, Martin Dogger, Meadsy69, Pantouflee, and many more
Clans: R0RY, K1NG, VYPER,CATS, FEAST (too op in tourney pls nerf), E7 (too op in memes pls nerf)
Players: Everyone who is not toxic af and knows how to cooperate

P. PLS NEVER BUY CRATES
P.S.YOU NEED TO GET A PREMIUM IF YOU WANT PAINLESS CREDITS GRIND 
P.S.S. JOIN TOURNEYS AND GET GOOD TEAMS FOR CREDITS AND GOOD CLAN TOO (Helpful, not toxic, easier grind with supplies)
P.S.S.S. MILITARY HONOR IS USELESS (Troll players that is hard to report/ban)
P.S.S.S.S. Oh if u salt and get reported woooo chat ban

12090,EDIT!!! Dont even bother!just download the original world of tanks instead!blitz is for handicapped mobile players.....
12091,"okay. let's get straight to the point.
i must say, the game itself, is in fact actually really good. i love the concept of arcade tank battles, though it pretty much an arcade-ier version of the original WoT game.
but as an originally was a mobile game, i must say it runs very well on PC. i get 60 fps constant on max graphics, in fact it's the only well-running game on my rubbish laptop. the graphics itself isn't that great, but it's understandable since it's optimized for mobile.
but in my opinion, though the concept is great, most of the running elements are great, the devs ruined everything in its currency system. it is f2p with a lot of p2w elements. if you don't buy anything in the game whether it be gold, starter packs, tank packs etc. your game progress will be extremely slow. in a nutshell, no money spent = no regular win, no good win rate, no OP premium tanks, etc. 
now the community. oh my GOD the community. to put it simply it's pretty much the same as the minecraft community in it's dark age years ago. toxic kids, 40% rankers, the ones that will rage and curse when get killed, you know the usual.

so, to summarize:
concept? great.
performance? great.
gameplay? great.
graphics? not bad, but not good either.
play system? f2p with a lot of p2w, very bad.
community? oh god please no.

overall score: 4/10.
recommended? NO. don't even bother.

12094,"dudes this game is great but now my battle quen is stuck and it sais that there are 0 tanks like all types of tanks. i restarted the laptop i unistalled to game then reinstalled it and its still there when i open my game it gose to to battle quen and when i press the ESC button on keyboard or click the button that would return me out of quen it stays there with the loading yellow icon so yeah not that the game is bad i just need to know how this can be fixed cause i grined hard on this game even thoe i got a box tank

12096,"Do not under any circumstance play this game.  It is run by the russian mob (not really) and is totally biased (really).  you can see when your team will lose.  The speed of play is slower for one team than another.  I run the same tank in different scenarios and can tell you that the responsiveness and speed of play is reduced - and that team always loses.  Similarly i can tell before even firing the first shot whether my team will win because we are moving much faster.  This platform is totally pitched to get you to spend money.  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES START PLAYING THIS GAME - unless you want to empty your wallet (not kidding) into the hands of the russian mafia (just kidding).  Yes, it is pitched one way or another.  Totally a rip off."
12097,Awesome game.!
12098,"Dumb Game, all the players are fucking wuss, using heavy tank, the matchmaking sucks. There is only five maps, the tank destroyers can't even destroy  heavy tanks. This is another pay to win game. So disappointed."

12100,"I rate this as 8/10 cause it lacks some stuff atm 
but I would say it is good"
12101,my first thoughts on it is a good game and free so thats a plus the contrls are a bit wonky but thats ok i like it
12102,"Don't play this game, whatever you do don't do it.

Tempting as it may, a free to play game; however don't even be tempted. Don't get me wrong it is skill based, however your teammates are stupidly stupid that makes even the most stupidous person stupid. I played both roles of being stupid and quasimodo in this game; the matchmaking is so bloody stupid and horrendous. More than likely you would be assigned with stupid retards, battles almost always become one-sided massacres. Either you are massacring them or being treated likewise. When you gain a winning streak the game seeks to humble you; forcing you to unnecessarily carry your stupid teammates. This can be mitigated by reading the forums; however by going to the forums your merely exposing yourself to braggarts (rightfully so!); 60% and up winrates are the norm and anything less than is less stellar. This is my second account for this game (first one is for the 40k Predator event) both winrates over 50%; this one has 1,200 battles {alot less than my first} and 54.90% winrate (a far fall from my highest at 56.20%).  Infact forum participants rightly view this record as mere rubbish and their primary response as always and will always be is to git gud. That's it git gud. Matchmaking is horrible; it follows luck however a personal theory of mine (unconfirmed) is that the game sets you up to lose and lose and when you at the hair's breadth of tolerance they start giving you easy battles; however this is an illusion they simply don't want to lose players who quit.

Once you survived the earlier tiers, higher tiers are often new and dangerous for upcoming players. Brawling is more common, grinding is hellishly hard with stock equipment (alongside with dealing with incompetent teammates and being under-equipped yourself means being fodder to the slaughter). Free Exp is a commodity; saving it is a must if you wish to survive later on. The higher exp requirements and this horrendous matchmaking system makes it a breeding ground for the game to take advantage of the player's frustration; buying gold for real cash to ease the pain of levelling up to the next tier. In which case horrible players do so, thus making the player pool worse. 

Overall a fun game at the beginning but a frustrating game at the higher tiers. Community is garbage, your teammates are 95% garbage when it is 5% then you are garbage compared to those guys. You would be constantly pressured by circumstances to buy gold in order to get good equipment, stock is garbage remember. 

If somehow you still want to play this horrible frustrating game then I would recommend the forums and watch videos made by Wot Blitz Players; please do so! It helps, it may aspire you to become a Unicum or maybe more! But is it worth it?"
12103,"Shit game sends you to all-tier 3 battle, with shitty teammates, when you have a tier 2 tank. And then, once you finally got a tier 3 tank... yes, you guessed it, they send you in an all-tier 4 battle! This never ends!

And the higher the tier, the worst it gets, and it's not a matter of ""skill"": higher tier tanks have more powerful armor, and powerful armor doesn't just reduce damage, it can even fully block it. I once shot a tier 4 tank 5 or 6 times in a row (from my tier 3 tank): not a single point of damage taken... 

At higher tiers ammo and repairs are so expensive that you may actually _lose_ ingame currency when playing battles! That's right, you may need real money just to buy ammunition and repair your tank! https://steamcommunity.com/app/444200/discussions/3/1629664606999666683/
So fun! Thanks greedy devs!

Last but not least, I'm always, alawys ALWAYS IN THE FUCKIGN SHIT TEAM with retarded uncarriable teammates. From the time I started playing, I've almost constantly been the top player in my team every game..."

But apart from the game play itself, it would be better if the developers increase the platoon size to 3 as a minimum to make the game enjoyable if you have your comrades with you, and that the match making should be balanced, since my duo and I are still placed against 2 tiers above us.   

For real though, I just played the pocket version for the sake of performance in game play, since my craptop can't handle the pc version anymore for some God forsaken reason, but as soon as I have a new laptop or something that would take a miracle, I'd return to the pc version and continue the British Heavy Line on my Churchill VIII."
12121,Ótimoooooooooooooooo! Muito divertido!

12123,"Just play the real game,.. this thing is a piece of rotting sh,ite"
12124,Super Good if you want spend your free time with short battles useful for breaks.
12125,"I have over 240 hours played of this game on steam and another 200 on mobile. The game is pay to win. That's a fact... if the premium tanks WG sell weren't overpowered, then no one would pay the ridiculous amount of money WG ask for them. I have spent 150 euro on this game and their premium tanks, not because I need them to stay ahead of the competition, ( but then again... who doesn't like the edge over other players, funded by your wallet?) but because I have invested so many hours into the game already, and I have come to conclusion after  400 hours of game play... 

I like this game a lot. I like this game because I have put in the time and the effort into getting good at the game, which is in my experience the only way you're going to be able to enjoy this game and avoid the most toxic community in any game ever! ( Its honestly impressive how toxic the community is.).

 Losing isn't fun. I don't care what others say... I don't enjoy losing, I play to win, winning is the best part of the game for me. What makes losing so bad is the potential hate you get from opposing players and teammates alike. Sure you can block them,,, but after listening to their childish rant of how you didn't help them stay alive or pull off the 1 vs 3 because their dumb a$$ couldn't stay alive, you cant help but criticise what you did and how you performed. Its no way to play a game. Honestly its like being in a classroom trying to outperform your peers and instead of the teacher handing out results from the test individually and privately... he publicly announces everyone's results to the entire class and he doesn't stop the other students from picking on the lowest performing student.  You need to have wolverines atamantium skull to block out all the hate.

And one more thing... if you want to play this game, you have to do your homework. And what I mean by that is... you cant just hop into a tier 10 tank and expect to win 5 matches in a row. It will not happen. You have to start from rock bottom and build your knowledge of the game up from there. Ultimately, this is how you enjoy the game. You enjoy playing by beating other players, not getting beaten by them. And you need in game knowledge to do that. ( Don't be the a$$hole that says ""EZ"" after winning a game.) Its harsh I know, but its true for this game. 

People judge you on your stats and in game performance. Not on how cool of a guy/girl you are in the chat rooms or game chat. 
I would recommend this game to anyone who is willing to put in a lot of time and effort into getting good at the game.

""GET GOOD, GET TO ENJOYING THE GAME""- Me, Myself and I."
12126,"fuck you world of tanks you are pay to ween game fuck you you can haw my dick not my money you are shit fuck you idiots
still same shit after 3 years  MM so bad i hope you all die dogs mf
"
12127,"Game says ""Mandatory resources added to download queue."" Except nothing is downloading. I can't play, I can't change options, I can't even exit without hitting Alt F4."
12128,very nice
12129,It isnt realistic even  A BIT!
12130,I strongly do not recommend this game. It breeds a hostile environment and the game play is too quirky.
12131,"It's again a review when I don't have that much hours. But I think that it's enough to write it, especially because I probably played more on mobile than on Steam.

Like the name of the game says, ""blitz"", every match will last no longer than 10 minutes. Because let's be honest, that game game were pure created to be played on mobile. So what is the difference between playing on PC than on mobile? Probably on PC you get more FPS and whole game looks better. Also some people will find controls are more easy.

There's not that much to say if you played in the original World Of Tanks, rules are pretty much same.

But when you will launch it, you will see after few matches that there are 3 scenarios.
First: You will dominate the enemy team.
Second: Both teams will have same chances to win.
Third: You will get dominated by the enemy team.

I ain't going to say anything about these boosters, because I totally don't understand that mechanic. The biggest problem is for sure P2W. If you have nothing to do with your money, then spend it on gold and buy every possible upgrade and tanks. YES, YOU CAN BUY EVERYTHING IF YOU HAVE GOLD.

There wouldn't be anything wrong with that, but there is no possibility to recieve any free gold. Maybe through playing tournaments and winning special events, but even if you spend really lot of time playing that game, it won't be easy to earn anything.

Also playing without VIP is pretty much pointless, after every single game you will earn like 70000 silver. Sounds like a few more games and you will be able to fast upgrade your tanks. But no, if you don't have VIP account then after auto-fixing broken parts in a tank that you brang to a game, eventually you will recieve just 15000 silver. I don't wanna even mention that if you actually LOOSE a match you can even loose silver.

So if you like tanks, your PC ain't decent or you just want to try out tank cannons then you can download it. Despite of everything, World Of Tank Blitz is free."
12132,"very good game. I've been playing this for a long long time and even though I left it for almost a year, because they removed a lot of tanks from the game, I came back because it is just such a fun game. And on the upside: the removal of the tanks made the game more simplistic, which is - i think - the main goal of this game, compared to World of Tanks PC."
12133,the game is very very good
12134,I wasn't thinking about playing this game today I didn't even have it installed.  but I got a 95% off coupon for the mega pack.  If this was a marketing move it worked.  thanks for the coupon. overall a good game.  with a slightly more enjoyable player base then some of its competition in my opinion.
12135,"Short: 
No Artillery (no cancer),
No gold spamming,
Less RNG,
Runs on a potato,
Less skillful players,
All in all great fun 10/10.

LONG: More fun than the desktop version, people tend to not know how to aim their tanks, the crosshair does go full retardd here and there, but its fine. Be aware that this game is WG's desperation for more money, nothing can sate their greed. This version allows you platoon up with a mobile user as well, make a clan for 1m credits (which are quite easy to earn).
Gold shells are next to unnecessery because of the Penetration Highlights (unpenetrable is highlighted), unlike the original WoT where everyone spams gold, they even shoot gold at soft cardboard tanks. This version is a lot more fun and enjoyable, my only complaint is that driving the tanks feel like driving a tin can. For new comers i must say: Play carefully, i cant stress this enough, don't rush unless you have a death wish, keep one eye on the minimap always. Find a platoon mate, its even more fun."
12136,"Decent game for new gamers....recommended game for all....time would get passed eaisily...
"
12137,This game be jolly!
12138,good
12139,"Unethically grindy in a bid to force you to pay for a premium.
Unethical in game adware that just spams nothing but adverts for different in game products.

12144,"extremely slow and boring and mindless and also mind numbing!! it's also a pay-to-win mobile game ported to pc. if you like paying to win, or you've got some extra money punching holes in your pockets,  then go for it! otherwise, go find something better than this piece of crap"

Haven't played Blitz even on release but I got coupon today and finally tried the Blitz version.

Shame that it's not the 15 vs 15 but it's still fun and brought back the nostalgia of the past. 

With its very attractive 2gb size and still retains the basic mechanics, I would not hesitate to recommend you this."
12153,very nice
12154,YeeT
12155,"Great for new players!!! and for people who like driving historical tanks. downside is it gets boring slowly but worry not. the games get exciting to play every event!! events happen every month or two months, also its sucks wallet dry if ur  a premium player im a F2P player i love this game"
12156,This game playable for potato spec recomended for you wanna play alone or with your friend.
12157,"hella greedy devs,  selling op tanks ( not lying i bought one too just to see how it felt and it was amazing , this tank has my best winrate) . overall it's all fun and games until you hit higher tiers , lots of grind like other ""f2p"" games but over all it's pay to win. trust me don't play it , i aint lying look at the hours i wasted on this game...."

12165,It is fun
12166,"I love it but 9/10 not enough ketchup
"
12167,"""Armored Warfare"" is the game that is much better and I recommend you give it a try. It's also F2P/MMO.

The environment in WoT Blitz is simply toxic. 
And the game is a joke - more toy tanks every month and toy physics, etc.
In Armored Warfare they have M1, T-72, T-80, T-90, LeClerc and all kinds of modern tanks that WoT doesn't have at all."
12168,Best game I have played and spending on if I could
12169,i played this and it is a good game to  play and you play for free you can spend money on it if you won't i wold recommended it if you just like tanks
12170,"Bring back the old file
i playing this game just for the Girls und Panzer mod

still the best game for low spec pc, because this is from mobile version"
12171,"Bad matchmaking (the worth ever seen in a game) and pay to win (premium tank are clearly better than regulars one).
Avoid this game if you can."
12172,the game qs take way to long and the amor pen for tanks wich are clearly better than others suck
12173,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa no
12174,bad
12175,i like a lot
12176,this game a fucking joke when it come to tank fights i mite as well go back to WAR THUNDER i mean that game a joke to but not as bad as this one
12177,"Really good game, it's the pocket-edition version of World of Tanks. Try playing both of them!"
12178,It's a tank game. with tank controls. its what you expect.
12179,"Something has happened I am getting an error message and it says after 95 hours of playing Gereroberts does not exist in ther Europe server. Just what is going on, it let me create a new profile but did not let me play on my existing account through steam. Err 65 came up."
12180,"Big Grind
Big Dick"
12181,Awesome realistic battles. If you are looking for a explosive good time World of Tanks Blitz is for you!
12182,"Not what it use to be. 40%ers ruined it. Everyone for themselves... uninstalled. People don't know how to play anymore. sidescrape, angle armor, hull down... Then talk trash while playing like trash. Fake tanks galore. Historically inaccurate. Russian Bias. Could of been a good game. f2p with lots of major transactions. And events most people can not complete. Buy gold lot of gold, to buy pixel tanks, or other random useless pixel items."
12183,Very boring
12184,"Im not a keyboard warior, but this game is fucking shit.
They've been neglecting the PC verson of world of tanks for years, implementing many pay to win aspects.
Want proof? i found this video, its 30 minutes of explaining all the bullshit wargaming has don't to fuck us over!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34l-7dkEq80"
12185,"finally downloaded it and played on my crappy laptop, OMFG!!! ill never play on my phone again,,,,,, 4 years i been playing on my phone, not once have i tried on PC... gameplay is way better with keyboard and mouse, hands down...."
12186,"with over 500 hours in the game i can say for 100% certain now, this game has become trash. Wargaming has ruined the game adding fake tanks that never exsisted. Heavies all camp and try to be snipers, mediums and lights don't know how to flank. The mentality is all lemming one direction even if you don't encounter someone half way keep being lemmings. The events bring out the worse players imaginable talking 30% winrate people who can't walk and talk at the same time let alone aim or use cover. Heavies side scraping is a thing that none of these people can do. The game should be avoided as it can and most likely will cause anurism's. if you want a tank game play the legit World of tanks game or even better war thunder. The events are there to force you to pay to get top tier rewards, if you don't pay you are grinding games with these type of people. Ranked is the same deal and as a example for a event. This weeks event get wins  in 7 days to get a tank, except to get the reward you need over 80 wins a day, for 7 days straight. Sounds easy right, read the top."
12187,I liked how I was in control of all the options in the tank like moving to where ever I wanted to but I disliked how the first tank the game lets us start off with is kinda bad and it’s hard to go up against people with better tanks.
12188,no the f it up like were is the old world of tanks with artilery and big maps.  the queue times are sh** i spent 25 min and no game fond.
12189,bardzo ciekawa i wciagajaca giereczka na 1543 godzin
12190,good
12191,It's Ok.
12192,"I love the game but people think that the game is pay to win it can feel like that at times. the game is not pay to win if you have the skill, know your tanks, and look at the map you can do well. It all about how your skill to the very high skill players. it all depends on how you support your team, where you go , and how you react to situation. wargaming can make the tanks free or enriched.some get mad but you need to understand they pay employees to update, support, and design the camos/tanks. free games must have a pay aspect  to pay the enployees that devolope the game"
12193,F*ck this game
12194,"This game is like a prime example of Stockholm Syndrome. I know the game's bad, I know the community sucks, but I can't stop playing it.

Great quick battle format, at least compared to PC WoT.
Frequent updates, albeit their usefulness is debatable.
Frequent events, and now the battle pass format has been reworked. Time will tell if it's for the better, but personally I only see the benefits.

And now for the cons, I guess..
If you're feeling pedantic, the game looks like Morrowind half the time. PBR models are helping but they're being updated at a glacial pace of usually only three to five tanks per update. Note that there's over 300 tanks.
The community is incredibly bad. As a lot of MMOs, there's toxic people, but unfortunately they're very prominent here. Be it in in-game chat, youtube content or even the official blitz server.
The official blitz server is so bad I am actually adding it as a con here. Wargaming staff mean well, unfortunately most of the mod staff seems to have forgotten what it is to actually be a responsible adult. You should only use the server for news or giveaways. 
There's a couple annoying bugs every now and then. Android sometimes has really slow smartDLC (basically resource download manager in-game) downloads, Steam tends to load long even on a powerful system and the graphics settings and replays love to reset every patch.

8/10 don't play it. I was actually a happy man when I started playing this game."

12196,Tanks have health lmfao
12197,"The people who play WoT Blitz: WoT Blitz is bad! Play the PC game thats not on steam!

12199,"Pretty confusing at first, but quite a bit a bit better after an hour or so. 7/10"
12200,Nice if you want to have a big advantage over mobile plebs. Dont bother with this game oterwise. Get the normal one if you want to.
12201,"I don't think I can recommend this game anymore in its current state.

I previously recommended this game despite its flaws, but now things are getting out of hand. People have always cried about P2W tanks for as long as the game has been out, but it really wasn't as bad as people made it out to be. There were a few premium tanks that were very solid performers, but they didn't feel like they were breaking the game or doing something that a tech tree tank couldn't already do, which just a few exceptions. Even then, they were very rare and still had weaknesses. The WZ-120-1 FT and Helsing were definitely the worst the game had to offer in terms of P2W bs, but they were manageable due to their low health pools, poor or even no turret, and respectable but fair damage.

But that was a while ago. Nowadays, tiers 6, 7 are ruined due to the dominance and prevelance of Annihilators and Smashers, which absolutely take a massive dump on any sort of semblance of balance this game once had. They do way to much burst damage and DPM, their armor is insane and ridiculously troll-ish with how many cheap bounces they can pull off, and even have decent mobility, gun handling, everything that you would except to be worse since they have everything else. I've been seeing a lot of the WZ-120-1 FT recently as well since they did lootbox gatcha bs for it. It feels waaaaay too punishing to play a weirder or weaker tank now since people are absolutely abusing these tanks in platoons, and if you don't have strong tanks to fight them with, it's practically game over.

TL;DR game is truly P2W now and Wargaming clearly doesn't care since they have't rolled out a single nerf on these tanks since their release."
12202,Govno cyka
12203,ok so if youre willing to pay some cash every month then its a quite good game for you. even with friends. but you can go semi free to play( just bought some dlcs nothing else) like me. youll suffer a lot but things seem more fun. worth a try but dont get your hopes high
12204,love this game its one of the better games to play on your phone and by using steam.
12205,good game and it's free already so i dont see the down side
12206,I like the style of this game in the TDM where you have start another round after you die
12207,"Since I've been playing this game for more than 4.5 years now (probably have more than 1k hours spent on this game), the game is STILL a Pay2Win. The community can be toxic, times when teammates you have can be utterly useless, events are unhealthy towards F2P players since the grind can be difficult that results pockets being opened to get a tank/skins, developers being greedy, and how the matchmaking from the game alone is STILL a complete mess! Also, newcomers will not have a good time as experienced players will play low tier battles just to get a high WR percentage. It's only the matter of time before it comes a massive shitstorm towards the community of this game. Don't bother getting this game. It's not worth your time being. Best to look at other games that are worth your money and time other than this piece of shit of a company."
12208,good
12209,"Like it so much but i hate that p2w system, you buy VIII tank when you are noob and you can play but still i love that game"
12210,One of the stupidest communities in gaming history. At least 1 AFK person per match. No one understand capture the flag. How stupid do you have to be to not understand a game this simple?
12211,It has changed to the good side
12212,  why do other players get to take points. can they judge if u run into a trap or if i choose to hide and wait for tanks to come. I think players are not judges and think that this sucks. I do not like being judged because i did not act like someone think I should. SO MIGHT BE GOOD GAMES BUT ASSES WILL BE ASSES
12213,pay to win
12214,ur either fighting afk 6 yr olds or 40 year old sweatlords
12215,This game is awesome and cool even i love this cool looking game
12216,Best game ever
12217,"For what it is worth, this game if fun to play with friends; however, it is not good in terms of realism compared to War Thunder, but it is also an easier game to run, faster matches, and a lot less lag than War Thunder. It is far better than the original, so I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a game of tanks. I will note that it can be a P2W (pay-to-win) game and it is also a game in which you will have to grind for better gear/tanks. I will also note that if you have not noticed, there is currently (as of this review date) a free 3-day premium pass that can be used for a quick start-off and/or a premium experience."
12218,"Unfortunately I can not recommend this game anymore. With the removal of several tanks that I paid money for in lower Tues and the constant ""balancing"" the game is very inconsistent and the value I once thought it had don't exist anymore."
12219,"Fantastic game, ruined by a greedy developer.

Here's the problem. I've spent time and money on this game and the developer just took away almost everything I invested in one update. Please read carefully and BE WARNED.

I was just in-game looking at one of my favourite tanks. It's a tier 8 premium. Premium meaning I spent enough REAL MONEY on this one tank to buy a full console game for example. Seems crazy but I really like this game. And I like this tank so much that I spent even more real money on a fancy paint job, just to make it look pretty. But I'm just looking at it, not playing it because my tank has been robbed.

I've been driving this tank for awhile now, FULLY EQUIPPED and able to go head-to-head against any other tank on a level playing field. And this is not the only tank I've spent money on. Some players spend hundreds even thousands of $$$ on this game. But it's genuinely a great game and few of us regretted it until....

....update 3.8 happened. My tank. ALL my tanks have been robbed of their equipment.

Under the guise of improving the equipment system (which was in no way broken) they have taken away all my equipment, paid for in game currency. To re-equip my tank for peak performance I have to wait for newly-imposed TIMERS to run out which will take MOST OF A MONTH! Or, I can pay even more REAL MONEY to get it now. Don't forget I already paid plenty REAL MONEY for this tank and now they're asking for more, just to get back what I had already.

Sounds awful right? But this is not even the worst part. I have a garage full of tanks, we all do. And this update has taken away 100% of our equipment on all tanks and gave us enough compensation (in the form of a brand new alternative currency) to buy only 12% back. Yes, we did the math.

To get the rest back we need to grind all over again, and again we did the math. It will take ACTUAL YEARS for many players to recover what they ALREADY EARNED but was taken away. In extreme cases, up to a decade.

The more TIME and MONEY you invest in this game is more that the developer can take away from you at any time. That is the bottom line here. So think carefully before playing this game and especially before you spend money on it."
12220,"Fantastic game, always something to do and new tanks and modules to unlock. The game is easy and fun to play even if you aren't planning on spending any money."
12221,pay2win...but a nice game.
12222,"No, it's not an MMO."

12225,"I really love this game because it suites my laptop and runs at a solid 60FPS!! and the great detail 
(Detail not as great as World of Tanks itself but its definately ok! :)"
12226,The devs are ruining this game with real money crates to get overpowered tanks. You are not even guaranteed a tank. (For example £10 for 1 crate with a 5% chance of gettting overpowered t22 medium. Other 95% is a waste of money.
12227,"Pay-to-win, bad auto matchmaking"
12228,This was the one WoT game that never needed to see the light. I mean really all we needed was the original WoT with updates to be put on steam.
12229,"Yes, Give it a go"
12230,Very very good
12231,the game is great but now when i try to go on and play the game crashes
12232,"Don't listen to negative reviews, they are toxic kids that come from league"
12233,Stupid and disgusting matching. War-gaming company should work harder.
12234,best tank game on this world
12235,"Such a pay2win game at the begining,hitting a tank(controls are shit) is hard af but its still a fun game to play in your free time and u dont get bored that easily."
12236,I was wrong. game is poo
12237,very fun game to play
12238,"It's a fun game, unless you don't suck at it. If you're any good, you get put into shitty teams 9 out of 10 times. It makes it nearly impossible to get any satisfaction out of playing. I played my last match for about 45 seconds, dealing plenty of damage to the opposing team, but then all of them came at me at once. Only then did I realize my entire team had gone and gotten themselves killed so I was the last one. It's incredibly frustrating, because this game could be awesome if only the matchmaking was randomized, but it's not. The matchmaking is done to purposely put good players at a huge disadvantage.

Despite the shitty matchmaking, it is still a fun game. I would still recommend it, but only just.

Also, I should add that I have many more hours of gameplay and even a little bit of money invested in the mobile version of this game. The mobile version is identical."
12239,"Surprisingly it is NOT a pay to win game!

_ Casual only
_ Very good matchmaking system
_ Complete the daily tasks to get credit or any booster; also u may combine the boosters for even more boosting!
_ The same old story that it takes a million years to RANK UP!
_ Reload time on medium tanks are inslanly too long; Like 11.3 Sec!
_ There ain't no way u make gold coins, U must buy them with real money

BUT still its fine and I enjoy the game!"

12258,"short short description is like this:

- you can`t escape the feeling that you are mouse thrown at cats to play. cats are the ones who pay for the items/tanks.
- the normal game is the one with premium imho
- when you play without premium is like game is laughing in your nose and it is a worst feeling.
- the fact that they offer the possibility to win games with real money is not fair and prove nothing.
- the balance of players thrown in a game is the worst kind I have ever seen in my life. You get to play with all the noob players who drives like blind flyes into buildings and don`t have any idea of what is happening.
- also they need to make a system when a player enters a game and the tank remain immobile for more than 30 seconds to boot the player and put a bot made by the medium stats of that team.
- somehow they serve you more commercial after the premium ends
- i have bought a tank with 10 usd just to see the premium and the premium tank. After this premium have ended even if my team won a match i still keep receiving -% payment for the match :))) like someone is angry and punished me for not paying anymore.
- at every start of the game you get the most ""not penetrated"" ""ricochet"" ""bounce"" ""that didn`t go through"" and so on like the game wants to protect all the players at the beginning. After 1 minute you shell will penetrate almost anything except when you fire poorly and that shell ricochet
- even the air you breathe in this game costs money
- you get to put a camouflage on to you tank and that camouflage needs to be repurchase at the start of every battle WTF ????
- i didn`t get exploded I didn`t get hit on previos game why is there the need to take my money for a lousy camouflage again ?
- you need to unlock then you need to purchase then you need to repurchase automatically .... next thing need to be like you are in cab you enter the game you start loosing money just to watch tanks.
- a one of the best psychology they know that we men are born idiots with the need to show big things one of these are the fetish for tanks
and they walk on that line making allot of profit.
- the game is a trap like a big one, with 100 usd you can buy a nice game, here 100 usd can be pocket money for the weekend. I think you can put 10.000 usd into this game and don`t have all the options and all the tanks which begin to looks greedy asf for the developers.
- game is like a casino with other words, play with only what you can/get if you don`t want to get poor v soon

- so game is nice not so the policy of the game which is lousy and sad for a good build game.
- WARGAMING must be the greedy est company in the whole world, they were having a contest where u win some coupons that u can turn them into gold silver and such. I forgot to enter that day in the game and those were gone. They could have gave me the worst choice meaning silver it was like 600k silver. BUT NO they toke those coupons and gave me nothing. Understand that those 600k i can earn them in 10 battles is the concept and the message that they send. ""It`s not about the money it`s about sending a message"" which in my case was very clear they took those lousy 600k silver just to make me buy more silver.
Wargaming is Greedy asf !

12260,good game
12261,Frumos joc
12262,If you love world of tanks but can run in due to a crappy pc then this is a great replace ment this game is so fun and addicting i love it 9999999/10
12263,"Awesome MMO/FPS game, graphics and game play are excellent and it's easy to lose yourself for several hours paying the game. Several different Tech lines with a wide variety of tanks. There is a button in 'Settings' that allows who can contact you in the game. A very usefull tool for individuals to control their game play."
12264,"WOT Lite with same bad things added,manipulated MM,cheaters,pay to win tanks,broken spoting,imposible report players,invisible hits..etc
I really hope WG balance MM more and fix penetration specially on LTs,bounce 3X paper ELC?Or get only tracks by 130Mm gun?No problem.

This is WOT,only who Pay can win.

One good thing:There is no arty."
12265,Fun game
12266,I enjoyed this game :) Highly recommended if you love Tanks!
12267,lmao
12268,"Excellent game, perfect. Besides afew bugs here and there, the game is nothing but utter fun, if your a historian then this game would be perfect for you, and if your just looking for a free fun game to play on your free time, this is it. 0 Regrets downloading this game."
12269,I love Ambushing enemy Tanks with M5 Stuart
12270,piece of crap like the regular WoT.
12271,"While I do enjoy this game, and it is quite fun (the lack of artillery is what I enjoy most lol) it does not hold the same respect as the original title. I'm not sure why they put Blitz on Steam instead of the original, since both are free to play but this rendition is still enjoyable, just dumbed down quite a bit. If you enjoy WoT but want a more casual experience, Blitz is where it's at!"
12272,"neverending ""data synching"". even if i close the game and reopen it later it opens up to the synching screen again with no way to get out of it"
12273,nice
12274,"It's a good game especially for being free but man the menu & rewards stuff complicated.  I got my first tank a long time ago, a M2, and just recently started playing years after I first heard about this game.  Added a few things to the tank and I'm kicking ass as a level 1.  It's amazing how bad some people are at this, even those who have been playing, sitting out in the open with no cover.  The turret is slow to turn so you have to be strategic in how you position yourself and pay attention to the direction you're going.  It seems like this is a very difficult concept for people to understand, I guess if you're new there's an excuse but it really isn't that hard with some practice.  Really wish the graphics were better and there was a wider variety of maps.  I still can't figure out how to purchase another tank without paying cash and I believe there is a way using in game credits although I'm very happy with my entry level m2."
12275,Got hacked by someone in this game.......
12276,Very well made game! But.... I recommend the original WOT because they have better graphics and more tanks
12277,"Excellent and fun game, well developed and popular, recommend to anybody lookng for realistic tank battles"
12278,"TANKS
"
12279,its very epic
12280,MATCH MAKER SUCKS.. BEING PUT WITH TRASH PLAYERS FOR LIKE 7 TO 8 GAMES STRAIGHT AND LOSING MY WIN RATE DROPPING BECAUSE U HAVE THESE POCKET WARRIORS BUYING TANKS SO THEY CAN PLAY IN HIGHER TIER AND THEY DONT HAVE A CLUE HOW TO PLAY THE GAME. PLAYERS SHOULD HAVE TO WORK THERE WAY UP THE TIERS LIKE A NORMAL PERSON AND EARN THE TANKS TO MOVE UP TIERS... IT REALLY IS MESSING UP THE GAME FOR THOSE WHO PLAY IN CLANS AND TRYING TO EARN THEMSELFS GOOD WIN RATES. MAYBE YR WIN RATE SHOULDNT BE JUDGED BY YR TEAM BUT AS YR PERFORMANCE IN GAME..
12281,"on veut world of tanks sur linux 
"
12282,"This game is just Beautyfool i like it, its so good created and the team work&and the strategy its just perfect"
12283,Somehow pay to win game.
12284,This is called a MMO but the only multiplayer element is your team throwing the game
12285,nice
12286,"1)Toxic, 2) Imbalanced, 3) Donations.
Even if you play well and every game you have more dmg dealt than whole your team all together, you will 100% loose these battles. You will always get 5out of 7 players who has 40% win rate... You either get the most toxic players from whole server or you just get a 100 looses in a row. Played Blitz and Original WOT. Both have horrible balance + impossible to play without donations... To get to the 10th tier tanks you'll have to buy at least 1 premium tank of 8 lvl.
P.S. don't think I will be playing this game anymore, eventhough I have 15k battles."
12287,"I honestly don't get how people find this game fun. It's slow and boring. Also, even on all High, the graphics are terrible."
12288,Wargaming's greed has broken the game
12289,Can't Play after I download it and install. Keep saying Cannot connect. Error: 64 to every server.
12290,"i used to have on mobile but then deleted it. Got it again here and really like

very nice"

12292,Good Game
12293,Best
12294,"First off, I haven't played this game in a few years. In that time, somehow world of tanks has become a shadow of what it used to be. Used to feel at least a bit immersive, now it feels cheapened somehow. Like a dated arcade game. Totally didn't expect to be playing with half of the slots filled with bots. Not smart bots either. This AI will sit completely still and take hits and just keep a bead on it's target. It will also not attempt to stop a cap victory in many cases. Used to recommend the game but this new ""Blitz"" has ruined it for me."
12295,Awesome Game
12296,"I think it is a great game,only problem is I can't use a xbox controller for the game"
12297,would be better if this can be played with my steam controller
12298,very good game. husain liked it. would recommend adding a arab tech tree.
12299,"this game is good and it a masterpiece 
fuck WG AND THEIR UPDATE KILL ALL MY MAIN TANK!"
12300,RNG will fuck your arse so bad
12301,"The matchmaking is just about luck, most of the time you will get matched with 35% wr monkey players in your team. Even on tier X many players have no idea what's their role in game (lights are camping on TD spots, meds don't spot etc..). Also this game has a cancerous toxic community."

I have been in and out for years and this game is just a battle royale, no skill needed, run in and roll your face on the keyboard shit game......Unless you expect 0% learning curve, and 0% teamwork to complete the objective this might be for you.....Basically enjoy this turd on treads."
12311,old but i like :)
12312,"Great game, but some of the tanks kill you in one sot and are op.  I mean they have this whole pay to play thing going on and I don't want to spend $60 on an OverPowered tank to be a badass per level on a 10 level system...  That's like a $600 investment to have good tanks in this version of the game.... Otherwise it is quite fun.  I wish there were levels or other more immersive options e. available.

12322,"FUN! effing fun, love it, play it everyday!!!!"
12323,Nice game dudes
12324,"Good game, funny, with strategy and all. But i'm a free gamer (was). I played for years if i count my mobile account, and my best tier tank is the IS(Soviet). It's a grinding heavy game, and you will take breaks from it sometimes up to years or forever, cause grinding hours and hours to have a tank that isnt fun or GOOD guess what, isnt fun."
12325,Good game. And even better graphics. very good game go play
12326,My computer has just found a virus that was in a document of world of tanks while it instaled Thank you.
12327,"World of tanks Blitz is just like any other warmachine game of wargaming a good and teachful game about how machines fought. Many different kind of tanks: Tank Destroyers, Self Propelled Artillery, Light Tanks, Heavy Tanks and Medium Tanks.
For engineers and tankfans is this the game to learn about Armored warfare."
12328,"Essentially a Truncated and more Arcadey version of the Regular WoT game. Graphics are lower quality (It's a phone game afterall, so you can play with people on a phone, and sometimes it shows, as they drive like bots), but that means if your pc is a potato...then you can run it. 

Matches are only 7 VS 7 too instead of 15 VS 15 and there is no arty. Fewer nations too, but still alot of tanks...microtransactions are there but not as overbearing as I remember in the OG game years ago (Premium Shells are available for credits now). Although, some of the premium stuff is a bit crazy ($50.00 for 1 tank? lol) and it can be a grindfest at times. 

Overall it's truncated and easier to get introduced to the main game (camo, crews etc, are all incrementally introduced, which I don't remember that being in that original when it came out years ago). Good to pick up and play for 20 minutes when you have a a chance...(the original WoT has changed ALOT, I feel almost like its a hard/realism mode when I go and play that compared to this)


Still though its free, and I have the most fun in Tier V, which you can quickly get to without spending any real money. Check it out if you like Tanks/History/Combat games (Listen to your team mates FFS btw...)"
12329,"its a fun game, played it on mobile and now on pc is much more eazy and fun with mouse and keyboard"
12330,"I find its a very enjoyable game, which is fun to play and engaging with the added bonus of being a free game."
12331,tank
12332,fun game and ez  whene i play it i relax and injoy

12334,"Though the starting has a learning curve, this game is very enjoyable for extended gaming."
12335,good
12336,good game
12337,"Well, it is a typicall F2P MMO with a lot of grinding and of cause the possibility for shurtcuts (stuff like premium account) if you are willing to spend some money that is. You have more than 5 nations to choose from e.g. Germany, USA, USSR and so on and most nations have several tech trees with light, medium, heavy tanks and tank destroyers. You start at Tier 1 with tanks like panzer 2. For every battle you get experience for the tank you played with and silver. Experience to research tanks in and/or components for them (better gun or engine) and silver to, well to buy them. This goes up to tier 10 and takes longer with every tier. Of cause there is a third currency just called gold which is the currency you have to buywith ""real money"" and with which you can get mentioned shortcuts. You have daily quest (which have been implemented not so long ago) giving you rewards and events almost every month where you can win special tanks, boosters etc. Like is said typicall F2P mechanics both good and like you will see later bad.    

I am not going to explain how the game or rather it`s core mechanics work in detail `cause this takes more than a few words in a review. Simply put: you drive a tank with a certain amount of health, armor and a gun. 7 players per team. Shot at the enemy till he is dead and survive yourself... very very simply put. Of cause there is much more to it. I just want to say in comparison to normal WoT (if you happen to have played it) it is much more casual. No training of individual crew members, no looking after exceeding wight capacity and so on. Also when you zoom in you can see which parts of enemy tanks you can penetrate.

I realy used to like it despite, or rather because of it beeing more casual than normal WoT. But in the last year or so they realy made it worse and worse. Why ? Well, now we are going back to my previous mention about the bad F2P mechanics and seeing in which way this game is not so different than noraml WoT. Because it certainly dosnt differ when it comes to the devs beeing somewhat greedy. I mean 50 bucks for  a tank with some camo, for real now ??? But hey you dont have to buy them, right ??? and the rest is just cosmetics and shortcuts !!! The problem is some or rather a lot of these so called ""premium"" or ""special"" tanks are op. Ranging from slightly to completely game ruining. Especially in tier 7. I dont envy anyone starting and having to go through that. And the grind has become even more grindy partly because of  these premium tanks and partly because new tech tress seem to need more and more experience with every new addition. But also because something changed with the matchmaking. I cant really put my finger on it but it is just that something seems off. Nowadays most of the time one team gets utterly crushed by the other, at least in tier 6/7 and above. And when looking at the player profiles afterwards it is shoking to see the difference in games played, winratio and stuff like that. It is almost like the better players are getting put in one team and the ""not so experienced"" ones in the other over and over again. And because of that they are getting crushed over and over again. You dont need a top notch matchmaker to overcome this problem, every half decent matchmaker should do the trick. The kicker is that it did not so long ago. One could get the impression of this happening intentionally to encourage a greater buying mood from the people getting crushed all the time.


Saying all this meakes this game sound really bad and you could get the impression that this game is the worst and just a dirty money grab. But it is still good fun and seeing/playing all these tanks makes up for some and the higher you come in tier the more experince you will have gathered making it even more fun cause now you see/use different things than before and dont have to rely on premium ammunition as much for example or you can use your tanks amor better since you now started to understand angling. It is just that the game got a bit worse over time, not the mechanics but rather the monetization methods. Would i recommend it for everyone ? Big NO. For people with time on their hands and a slight faible for tanks . YES !! (if normal WoT´s complexity puts you off). I hope i could give you a good impression of this game and what is currently it`s major problems so you know when you start this game what you are in for."
12338,This is a game for people of all ages and there are tons of fun to be had. There are certain mechanics that make each tank type different from one another. I recommend anyone interested as a veteran player myself.
12339,"Extremely fun game, doesn't require a high end PC either."
12340,"Honestly miss the days my T95 could stair into the barrel of heavy tanks and shrug the rounds off all day. Now a Fing light tank pen strait on I should not have to back away from light tanks shooting my 350mm front armor
"
12341,The game is fine for casual players. But don't get to caught up in the amount of stuff they put in your face for you to buy.
12342,Pretty good. Not gonna lie I did terrible.
12343,Great game worth a look
12344,"enjoyable, runs smoother than the standard WOT."

12348,awesome
12349,Можно поиграть
12350,"A much quicker and simpler version of the full game. Battles are usually over in just 5 minutes and all currencies can be gained by playing and taking part in events, so not pay to win either. Personally I prefer the original but this is just personal choice. While this can in theory be played on mobile too, anything above tier 4 without a controller of some sort is going to be very difficult.

All in all a great game 8/10"
12351,"Very good game, my favourite, play it almost every day and never get bored. Would recommend for everyone to try it."
12352,ok
12353,best mobile game
12354,"интересно,но скучно"
12355,Easy target practice
12356,"IT NIFTY

but grindy"
12357,"Not my favorite tank game but not bad either, just not my cup of tea."
12358,"great game, but it keeps shutting down.  Have to reboot my PC all the time.  Thinking about uninstalling game.  To many updates.
Uninstalled game for 2-3 months.  Re-installed 2 weeks ago.  Game still shuts down & locks PC up, have to reboot.  Sucks, get to do 2-8 battles, that's it.   Wait for several hours then try again, same thing.


"
12359,"The mobile version of World of Tanks has honestly made balancing decisions for the better over the Desktop counterpart, but it's plagued by lootboxes with a 3% chance to get a mediocre vehicle that everyone hypes up to be the most broken thing in the game.

+1/-1 Matchmaking
+/-5% penetration RNG (still 25% damage RNG)
6th Sense available by default, even with 50% crews
No crew member management (once a tank reaches 100% training, it will always be 100%, even after selling and rebuying)
Increased hitpoint pools of mid-tier vehicles, increased hitpoint pools of lights and paper TDs
Stat-boosting consumables don't fight for slots with fire extinguisher and med kit
Derp guns almost completely removed from tiers I-V

In addition F2P players can easily receive premium tanks from events and premium time from daily missions that are honestly nowhere near as difficult as the campaign missions on PC. 
Joining a clan gives you access to the cheapest and perhaps strongest tier 8 premium at the moment, the IS-5.

However, for all of that there are still 2 elephants in the room:
- High alpha and big armor still dominates the meta. Can't poke anywhere without getting slammed, low pen tanks can just go home. Tier 10 is full of IS-4s, Mausen, FV 183s, and JP E 100s
- Tier 7 is dominated by some pretty P2W premium tanks that make some of the tier 8s look in serious need of buffs. Be it an armored KV-2 with the SU-152 gun or an AMX CDC with spaced armor and instantly-repairing tracks.

I'm honestly on the fence about recommending it, but WoT players should give it a try.

"
12360,One of my favourite games. Hope there'll be another hunt for IS-3 Defender.

12362,nice game
12363,shit

12365,"Fun game, many different tanks (maybe a little too much to choose from). Definetly worth trying."
12366,this game runs very nice no lag no crashs i really reccomened this if u want a good free game
12367,"Simply put, an enjoyable fast paced game for al tank lovers"
12368,It is better.
12369,As a veteran player with 600hrs+ on both windows 10 and steam version i would STRONGLY recommend this game for someone who is just looking for some fun with friends. Sure the game can be glitchy sometimes and can even make you fly in some cases. But overall i have enjoyed my experience so far. Nothing could be more fun than driving around blowing other tanks up. Thank you very much for the great times and the funny moments.
12370,Does anyone know how to use tactics and strategy in this game? Or has it just become a shooter? It seems no one knows how to use tactics. I've forced battles to become draws because everyone doesn't seem to know that tanks can camp too. Its called ambushing. Just have 1 or 2 tanks camp to defend the base.... Other than that its a good and addicting game.
12371,"Excellent fun! With over 2600 tourney battles, for me it is the best part of this game. Tanks are not cheap or they take much time to acquire, so focus on the good ones and the ones you like to play."
12372,"The worst part of this game is the lack of balanced teams.
scratch that, the fact that they up-charges for everything compared to what they used to, the game has major bugs after every update,  ""removed"" ghost shots, crashes randomly, and much much more.  enjoy Satan's game, ""free"" of charge. its getting worse at time goes on, bug after bug in the game."
12373,ver thicqq
12374,i love how my progress can carry over between platforms (mobile/pc/tablet/mac)
12375, bugged trash
12376,i wanna stay away but i got addicted
12377,This was a fun shooter game i really liked it.
12378,"Controls and game dynamics are very easy to get used to. Absolutely love the game, 100% recommend this game!"
12379,"What a cool game !! 
Can easily become quite addictive. 
Easy to play.... mastering it is another story entirely !! 
Genuinely playable for free, but there is also good incentive to invest.
Graphics are fine for me. WOT-B is a polished title.

Just wish it was covered by the V.A.C. programme.

Additional..... pointless review update for Steam Awards ."
12380,"This game is okay but , the problem is only the matchmaking i found out that i just win 2 battle in 15 battle , the team always imbalance..."

12395,It is a pretty nice game but the game is mostly able to run because of the PTW players and most of the time WarGaming doesn't listen.
12396,This game isn’t that bad in my review from playing this game in the past months there’s 1 thing I hate way to manny trash talking 4 year olds considering some of them don’t have any good punctuation in the training rooms people misspell way to much and the military honor isn’t that good because people will report you for no reason even if you did good or not and there is no available option for reporting peoples skills just actions in chat really but if so world of tanks either has to remove military honor and maybe make an XP system of leveling up or something or what they can do is make the military honor system a pending which means if you do that maybe a bot has to see if your reporting them for no reason or not Or what they can do is make a vote report system to see if a lot people agree to report the person or not but the rest of the game is pretty great the  Camo and maybe kv2 meanacing being nerfed a little do to the insane 800 dmg it can do not even a maus which is a tier x tank can knock that off know the camo is a little to overpriced considering there’s not much of perks in them you can either add more perks or make them less cheaper but that’s all i have to say in this review these are all my opinions and aren’t meant to be offensive in any way also it doesn’t mean I don’t recommend to play the game. The game itself is still pretty good.
12397,nice game
12398,Донатная помойка. Мне нравится
12399,coo lgame
12400,"Great game, played it on non steam and its a little bit different but a great game"
12401,"Addictive game, it's funny when you play KV-2"
12402,Tsidsia rob approved
12403,"Just play the PC version, and not this mobile port shit."
12404,Basic
12405,Has gone downhill
12406,this game is as fun as the world of tanks on ps4.
12407,"Players are F*ing retarded at the moment, very inconsistent matchmaking, historically very inaccurate tanks (and their guns). Was a good game a few years ago, but just very frustrating nowadays, as your team can't even shoot straight at the enemy sometimes."
12408,топовая игруля
12409,Quick battles in nice tanks.
12410,"Simplistic, but very well made and fun to play. If you liked the original game but didn't like the complexity of tank progression, this game is a must have."
12411,One of the best tank game
12412,yes
12413,Pretty good and addicting played it for hours. And spent alot of money on it XD I spent 145.33 USD on getting premium tanks and currency but worth it because  then I become an indestructable machine.
12414,Game laknat :)))
12415,"Very Great game, Spent many many hours on it. its not pay to win, But very grindy."
12416,This is very much fun I been playing the official one and this is very good one I really enjoy also fast game match
12417,"Im just here for the summer sales event.
"
12418,Good game
12419,This is a very fun game.
12420,"Pay to win, really difficult after tier VIII"
12421,Literally a phone game... spretty fun on the phone. Could play War Thunder
12422,"
"
12423,garbage
12424,good one
12425,best tanks game :)
12426,good game
12427,good game
12428,"Has some issues with toxic players but overall its a fun game which you can play when you have some time.
(Nothing changed lol)"
12429,"What the fuck is this? Adds over adds over popups over adds in attempt to get you to buy some in-game currency when you DON'T NEED IT.

Why would you spend money on a game which, to begin with, is utter shit?"
12430,"Good game
"
12431,"A great thinking-man game (if you have good team) smeared by a couple of detrimental problems: OP premiums in tier 7, some tanks are way stronger than other tanks at the same tier, MM is rigged to have you sometimes play against good players while your team consists of the cast from ""Dumb and Dumber."" If you are willing to learn, you will have a good time celebrating at the victory worthy of your hard work. 

This game is great to practice your patience too /s."
12432,si
12433,"they added this lootbox-infested piece of shit made specifically for mobile platforms onto here, instead of the real game, the more reason for steam to have the option of leaving reviews on developers and publishers and not just their products"
12434,"If you've always wanted to play WoT, but then without the +3 tiermatching and artillery, then this is the game for you! I prefer it to the original. Nice and fast paced, but it still has the core WoT feel. You gotta try it, it's free anyways!"
12435,"fun, easy to start. Blitz is a simple game to learn but difficult to master."
12436,wow NO WANDER I GOT NDIF GAME
12437,"Absolute garbage game, greedy fucking publisher. Trash servers pulled right out of my ass, the server connection is horrendous and the community got straight up nuked by the toxic radition of tschernobyl.

Avoid this game at all cost otherwise it will melt ur Braincells."
12438,"Its a  fun game, it may not be like its bigger brother, but it has a lot of the same features in a smaller, more low-hardware friendly package, running at a crisp 120 FPS on my crappy lil i3-powered laptop. I recommend it highly if you want to play WOT, but without having to set your graphics to low just to get near 60 FPS on a lower end PC."
12439,pretty epic
12440,Tanks are heavy like: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079692899
12441,Do not waste time.
12442,meeeh
12443,Its ok...
12444,Way better than the mobile version.
12445,okay kind of glitchy
12446,:)
12447,Very beautiful game!
12448,"Pretty nice, played it a few times. Can be a good option if you have to kill some time...:WoTB_tank:

EDIT: Played 2 more minutes and it still holds up as a very decent timekiller - it's not an AAA-Masterpiece like The Witcher, Cyberpunk2077, God of War or Command and Conquer Generals, but the arsenal and mass of well ""non-historic"" tanks make the games so unique that even after 5 years and far over 20.000hrs total(GooglePlay, WIN10, Steam) it's not getting boring. Several patches do kinda dampen the fun tho like the 5.5 lowtier removal or several ""balance"" patches that shift the meta critically around, but it's usually possible to get used to it in one update-phase. :WoTB_tank:"
12449,"Very good
Great if you love world of tanks but you don't have thousands of hours into a game to get a high tier tank"
12450,really bad game pay to win and cant get further without getting boosters or buying more tanks
12451,Game Santui Nombe One
12452,"Nice Game but Imbalance on Premium tanks, Please T9 Dracula is to OP nerf it lul :P"
12453,yea nah
12454,Okay for really low end systems.
12455,...
12456,good game
12457,Yeah it's alright if your pc can't handle normal WOT.
12458,A game full of tactics.
12459,Gewd Gaem
12460,"Good for quick matches, same as WOT speaking about tanks, armor, penetration, ricochets, e.t.c But quicker matches.

"
12461,"good

when WT server goes shit again"
12462,"Good net code, better balanced game now than ever, somewhat slow progression"
12463,nice
12464,"This game is very fun and super addictive. I personally enjoy this much more than PC version, as XP and credits are earned significantly quicker."
12465,"one of the few excellent games good graphics and gameplay  i ever played 
waiting for future updates"
12466,Good game
12467,a fun little tank game you can play on mobile or pc
12468,A wide range of tanks to choose from the interwar years right up to mid cold war era. gentle grind and very addictive. easy progress without touching your wallet.
12469,A competitive Version of World of tanks
12470,"Good game, definetly recommend it."
12471,damn
12472,"is good game, much fun, grate time, 10/10 must buy"
12473,"great game, no arty!"
12474,Great fun <3 lol
12475,Wartinder is better
12476,its garbage
12477,"meme
"
12478,"Sat behind a wall
killed 5 tanks
got all the medals
10/10 would tank so hard"
12479,...
12480,if you dont have the specs for the world of tanks this is a great alternative and you go thru tiers easier
12481,cool
12482,Meh
12483,piece of poop
12484,This game is very nice...
12485,"A great game, sometimes RNG says no but other wise it's a great game"
12486,Its a great game but with flaws
12487,pay to win
12488,WOTB is a good tank game if you don't have the time to invest in warthunder and isn't as pay to win as full PC version of WOT. I play it mostly on steam but easily one of the best mobile games out there.
12489,Not bad.
12490,This is cool game to play with friends
12491,its aight
12492,Very nais game!
12493,nice game
12494,gutt
12495,ERFG
12496,fun game to kill some time
12497,very good game
12498,nice simulator tank battle with better graphics and better gameplay also can play in pc low end
12499,Love This Game <3
12500,best
12501,it's a quick game and they have alot of giveways. can be a pay to win but u will do fine if you learn to play and not pay to win. it's not a for sure pay to win it does still require some skill and understanding of the game... I say yea give it a try
12502,"It's fun. However, anyone who is new to this game should not play alone."
12503,Good game needs refurbishing
12504,"Lots of input lag, if you're playing on a PC/Mac, download the PC/Mac version, more tank selections and bigger tech trees"
12505,"3000 hrs of timeplay , had a great start and improved until 2018 .
now you cant find a single game without having 4 premium tanks .grinding is no more cause you should spend money to get parts or actually skip the troublesome tank or you can end up ruining your stats for example tier viii which if full of IS3 defender is6 is5 and other op tanks . 
also they removed some popular tanks such as jumbo dw2 either to make grinding easier or avoid the winrate abuse .
balancing is weak especially platoon games , teams are full of fun players and trolls ( in every tier ) so you have to solo carry or platoon 24/7 which doesn't work in high tiers cause you will face 2 players of top clans against you .
better environment than the pc version and the graphics is good for a phone game.
recommended for phone .
"
12506,d
12507,good game
12508,"Absolutely very fun and i defenitely recommend it! 

Nominating for Labor of Love after 6 years of development by Wargaming"
12509,"This is a pretty good game. Hard to get the best Tanks unless you got money to spend, but if you have money and want to spend it then more power to ya. A good fun game with quick matches. 7/10 Cheers!!"
12510,bang bang uwu
12511,"Better than the original, you can solo carry easily here"
12512,recomendasikan
12513,NO arty
12514,"nice light version of WoT. A little bit slow in sniper mode, otherwise really good one if u want simplified version of tanks.
recommend!"
12515,"It seems to be nice, but I have not played it too much."
12516,pretty ok
12517,"I've had more fun with this game than ones that I paid $50 or $60 for. It's easy to learn with a good tech tree and pace for advancement. Sometimes the matchmaking leaves me frustrated, though overall I recommend it.

"
12518,GREAT GAME!!! also suk my 2inch jolly rancher
12519,gay
12520,very good job
12521,"its great if you have played on te mobile version, then te pc version is realy nice!!"
12522,i love this game :)
12523,"Tecnally World of Tanks but with mobile quality graphics, can be played both on pc/mobile, has loot boxes, rng and ocuppies less space!"
12524,Very nice
12525,dope game
12526,lol
12527,nice
12528,Good game
12529,Don`t play it.
12530,gud
12531,One of the best tank games I have played to date.  Realistic with the upgrades and tech.  And the ability to play with all the nations different tanks and thinking of how these tank crews must have felt in the any of the wars.  Recommend it to everyone who likes war games.
12532,"I love this game, but I would rather play real World of Tanks. You can tier up your tanks so fast i got to a tier 5 in one day. i would totally recommend this game."
12533,"yes!
"
12534,"This is a really good game!
-Easy to grind
-Easy to shoot people (depends on your aim ofcourse)
-Very fun game
I reccomend this game"
12535,"Pretty good game, the community can get salty af tho so like beware. Also always new updates."
12536,Pretty well game lol
12537,"Just got the game. Fun so far. Tutorial is helpful; once you realize the highlighting cues, it is easy to know what to do next."
12538,Rlly nice gam..
12539,"On the edge about this one. It has a fuckton of dirty microtransactions. A fairly simple, but sometimes fun game. Decide for yourself."
12540,Cool game
12541,just for summer sale 2019
12542,kalaanssssaaaaa
12543,"If you're playing on PC, get the proper client. This is a cut down version"
12544,Very good game. I enjoy playing it.
12545,Just bad. Worse than the original. Splitting the people into the teams like they have has killed the game.
12546,you go forward you go boom!
12547,"This game gets a lot of hate for being a mobile port and not the full WoT experience but having played both I can tell you this is just a different game. There's no artillery, the maps are small, and matches go very quickly because of it.

You still get your WoT mechanics with penetrations, armor thicker in front, angle of attack deflections, module damages, ammo rack explosions, and crew damage based on hit locations but in a slim fast paced fun design. And never more or less than 7 people per team.

All in all it's a really fun game for what it is."
12548,"Tbh this game is maybe somewhat enjoyable when you play with your friends and don't end up with potato teammates that are probably kids on thier mobile devices

This game is kinda pay to win because if you would like to have high tier tanks you need a big sum of credits which you can't gain easily with normal tanks
You too have to have enough willpower to play this game without going insane by the shitty community of poop players
It's even not really cool to like play with the mobile users because they won't be competitive most of the time etc
Etc etc"
12549,"for this ""game"" no money, what moron decide to split players in win and loose battles he has my hat down end deleting this thing with pleasure . Thank you and goodby. more games to explore loosers"
12550,Get this trash g*me outta steam please.
12551,Tanks.
12552,"I haven't played this game much, so I'm not sure if I can comment on this but downhill is an understatement."
12553,Nice.
12554,"I enjoy this game as a side gig while watching YouTube etc, It can be a lot of fun but be prepared to lose all faith in humanity as it has the worst community in gaming from knowledge and since its technically a mobile game, you can expect to spend thousands on items if you choose to do so. Loot boxes inside of loot boxes IS a common theme, honestly not sure how they get away with it.

I find it fun, you just need to put a price on what you find entertaining. :)"
12555,This game for low spec only :)
12556,It's very good
12557,Update như cái máu lồn
12558,"Steam account and Wg Accounts NOT LINKED!
Good game ruined by flaws from WG
Pc, iOS and Android players all together. Account is linked so can jump between platforms.
Excellent graphics for mobile devices.
Easy to play but hard to master gameplay.
Downside is team-based game with many poor players that can’t do basic tasks to help win.
Free to play and access many tanks, this will take you months to unlock. Good long term game.
Buying tank bundles are very expensive and costs add up quick. Watch reviews before buying tanks."
12559,Not bad!
12560,very goood games i loved it so much
12561,"Grindy but Great

It took me around 300 hours to reach tier9, but the process was very enjoyable"
12562,Fun game
12563,I really enjoy this game
12564,Nice tank game. I lost all of my money
12565,"goddamn piece of shit crashed on me, then put me back into the match and some filthy tier 2 had been continually shooting me till i died the moment i rejoined"
12566,Good for resting place
12567,12 непробитий из 10 в серую зону
12568,Played this on a whim and was really glad I did. I'm having a blast during matches and upgrading my tanks to get new ones. It's a nice change of pace from other games I'm used to
12569,"In case you can't run the full World of Tanks with the great graphics, you have this. Though it still has the Pay 2 Win aspect of World of Tanks. It is a good game for what it is meant for"
12570,"The game has been steadily getting worse as Wargaming adds more and more broke-as-hell premium tanks to the game. Tiers 6-8 are an absolute nightmare for anyone new to the game.

If there was ever a good time to get into the game, it was a few years ago"
12571,"Played first on mobile then on Steam, but left because of slow free-to-play grinds and toxic community. At present, the community seems rather dead, but also less toxic. The game is kinda cool if you're into WWII vehicles, but prepare for grinding or paying.

Oh, and don't expect any support from either Steam or Wargaming. Why they even bother cooperating when they so very clearly hate each other is beyond me.

If you really want to give this a try, just use the Wargaming client instead."
12572,good game
12573,"You might as well install the actual world of tanks if want world of tank. This is only good if youve installed it on your phone or tablet and youre already far through the tech tree. There are less tanks, poorer graphics, fewer maps, and an overall less developed game."
12574,simple yet adrenaline pumper.
12575,Good game. It could do much better and be a great game if it had wider battles with planes and infantry.
12576,play for fun
12577,"If I had the option to choose a life saving surgery or play World of Tanks Blitz as my last game.
I think I'd want a custom skin for my KpfPz.70."
12578,"fun, strategic, a way to kinda pass time or have a good laugh. This game is sooooo great give it a try at first you might not be able to win much but once you get better so does the game"
12579,"low and mid tiers are fun but the community in top tiers....absolutely toxic, i have at least 50 people on my blacklist, some even berated my after winning. its horrible how people would rqather be toxic instead of just simply playing or learn how to play better. ive even had to blacklist a few top tier players from purple. pramo and even 1 guy from uni0n, at least void takes strides in their losses and i have respect for them as a clan. amazing game!!! horrible community....."
12580,when you convert mobile game into pc and have a lot of pay to win
12581,Muehehehe
12582,Amazing game. Love it so much I have it both here and on my phone
12583,Dumbed down version of the original which is shit also
12584,Good game. Great to have in your collection.
12585,"hello i don't know what is happening with this game (WORLD OF TANKS BLITZ)  so i want to know what is wrong . i dont know but played 235hours of WOTB andwhen i logging in the game is *connecting* and then he stopt's and shuting down him self. please work on this game more and fix bugs. THX for reading this review . 



And if this game is sumting wrong with my steam cliant please write a comment i want to fix this."
12586,Prefer the WOT PC edition but you can play this on the go so this game Good....
12587,"Feeling nostalgic, I decided to give it a go, having given War Thunder a rest.

It feels like driving an RC car, with a BB gun glued on top of it.

Back to War Thunder"
12588,good
12589,why put blitz on pc ? when they already have WoT for pc :/
12590,Utter shit.
12591,OK BEEN TRYING FOR DAYS NOW VERY LITTLE HELP TO GET INTO MY GAME CANT GET IT TO RE DOWN LOAD OR ANYTHING TOTILY NOTHING AN NO DAMN HELP FROM STEAM I AM 70 YRS OLD AN BEEN PLAYING FOR OVER A YR HELP REALLY SUCKS HERE I HAVE TRIED EVERY THING JUST SO I CAN PLAY THIS GAME I GUESS U GOT SO MANY PLAYING LOSING ONE NOT A BIG DEAL
12592,"Good game for casual games and little children. I wanted something more realistic.

Good game, not my thing."
12593,this game is filled with players who have no idea how to play if u really want to enjoy then download wot pc version not this blitz
12594,"A very good game, but PC controls are difficult to use

It's a very good port from mobile, but it suffers from TMH (too many hotkeys)."
12595,just download the pc version of world of tanks not this crappy phone game why did they even put this on steam this is a total joke.
12596,"Its ugly, boring, damage system is laughable...

No match for War Thunder. Definitely."
12597,"An uglier, worse version than the original WoT. Same Microtransaction-frenziness though. Oh look, you won a container! Here, you won 250 Gold. Wow, a free tank. Want to buy premium? Hey, you won 5 days premium! If you play a mission, you win more stuff! Hey, you can buy special ammo with gold! Do you want to buy gold now? Hey, you won gold, do you want to buy ammo? Oh look, a lootbox fell from the garage roof, you get an xp booster! And yes, these are all free but stupid tricks to get you to spend real money.

Yawn.

So here it is, my full, uncensored, brutally honest review (Please read the sentence aloud to memorize and have it as a mantra ready in  the back of your brain):

>> ""When I needed some more free space on my hard disk, <<
>>  I knew exactly which game to delete first"" <<

That's it. Easy. Now repeat once more, class.

Epilogue:
It took me longer to unlink my steam account from the implicitely created wargaming account than to decide to actually get rid of this game.

For the mildly interested, here is what i did:

* go to your region's corresponding wargaming login page
* instead of login with a wargaming account, click on the steam icon
* a steam relegation service handles your login now
* login with your steam credentials
* now *I KID YOU NOT* Wargaming wants you to fill out your fresh wargaming account with your data.
* for the email validation, use a temporary mail service like 10minutenmail[DOT]com
* click the confirmation link in the inbox of that service
* for the password, use something like 1234abcdABCD
* now, after account verification completed:
-unlink your steam account under 'linked accounts'
-under 'data protection', click on delete account (this initiates the wargaming account deletion process. Step through it, follow all steps, use the links in your temporary mails provider, and voila, finished.

I didn't kid you when i said i wanted this bitrot faster from my machine than getting rid of the account.

yay, 3 more free Gigabytes!

*update:
- [spoiler]The 3 free Gigabytes messaged me, thanked me enthusiastically and claimed that they feel clean and untainted just as before now.[/spoiler]"
12598,great arcade tank game
12599,"Gr8 game for passing time or getting deep into. You can become an expert or stay an amateur, both are fun. The level of detail and information that went into the game is good but the main game is REALLY something to behold. But this is a great way to start."
12600,"Excellent game, 10/10."
12601,YES
12602,That one didn't go through!
12603,"Pretty good game, the community can get salty af tho so like beware. Also always new updates."
12604,Nice
12605,Good game reccomend
12606,"I love the game, the thing is I don't have all the space on my computer and I can't keep all these game because all the space they take.


(I do have the game on my phone)"
12607,"kinda pay to win, but still fun."
12608,Nice and EZ game to play i really enjoy it.
12609,I am in love with this game. The game itself is very addictive and the perks are out of this world. you dont have to be a rich kid to enjoy this game. love it.....
12610,"arcadey fast paced tank battle
if you want something more like a tank battle just play WarThunder"
12611,"28 minutes in.  Can't link any accounts, including Steam because it's ""already in use"".  Already in use...... by me...... in World of Warships......on Steam.

Really Wargaming?  Well you can do various things to yourselves of a depraved nature.  

What I played was alright though but their account setup in general is asterisking terrible.  May as well play on your phone, much less hassle.

So it's uninstalled.  Won't be missed."
12612,i didint know there can be custom matches or teams
12613,"I have played this on my tablet on my android
Its a very good game I Am slowly returning to it ,
As you know its more arcade based style world of tanks and world of tanks blitz,
It has always been a great game , i used to like warthunder but now i am liking world of tank blitz more and more,
The reason i have changed from war thunder to world of tanks blitz its because the premiums on each game War thunder demands £50 per new tank model nowadays and raised the prices of even there standard premium tanks, However World of tanks blitz  only demands £21 per new tank model they release in game and there premium is cheaper thats why i am slowly getting discouraged from warthunder , and moving back to world of tanks as it quite frankly has and edge over war thunder"
12614,"If you want to drain your money to nowhere. Understand that in this game like, only students with weak PCs, that is, there is no good team. You also want to know how much developers do not care about this game, then please! This game is for you! Miserable, bad and terrible"
12615,This is the game to play if you can't run WoT
12616,This game is a really fun game until your a high enough level that you are playing the people who live in their mothers basement who buy everything under the sun.
12617,"good game i love it but where is T-34
"
12618,"this game has decided to run players away in droves. They have decided to divide players in 2 groups. One gets easy battles and the other gets beat all the time. Blitz thinks that the gulag group will spend more money to help them win more battles. but it id futile because i Think blitz is i a money crunch. Example all the tanks that are for sale.  I played 26 games yesterday and only won 5. Guess , I am a member of the gulag team. people who are on the privileged team will call me names and say I am stupid , But  with over 40,000 game I know what has happened in the last year and half.  The game is not enjoyable to play."
12619,This version of WoT's is incredibly bad.  I've played since after its initial release and seen all the revisions and changes as this series has evolved and this one is by far the worst.  The level of detail is simplified to what you would imagine is a cell phone game on PC and offers nothing worthwhile to keep you coming back.
12620,game boots you after one game after update 6.0 .  game is too toxic to fathom.  you can't allow people to talk on the chat because they don't perform what is said anyways.
12621,Pretty well game lol
12622,"At begining it's not bad, you play on ""tier"" of the same tank level (+ what you  buy to increase your spec), you ""craft"" some add-on, research new tank, etc.. but kickly you get how is going to be. Free to play : unless you run the credit card, you won't be able to challenge others players really quick, after few hours the game is unplayable (for you). 
Even if the game was well ballanced, just with what you earn on the game you can't match others players' tank kickly, you just run like a (soon) dead duck (level 3/4).
 It's based on tank, ok,  it's just a game, more, an arcade game, but don't expect any realism. Here it's simple : any tank can destroys any tank (an M3/m5 against a pzIII or b1bis, sure).  Ammo doesn't make that much differences, neither armor, gun caliber, etc.  On a one to one the tank with the more ""life"" left win. The bigger team win, period. Therefore, as soon a team is at -2, it's likely lost.
What you add to your tank give you a little advantage but not enough with the others issues this game have.
Also yank and brit tanks  seem to have magical spec, run like a ferrari, have more  armor than a battleship and outcast any nation; probably a market share thing.
Finnally, starting with level 3/4 you will notice many plays at a team (with com), you usualy end 1 against 3 or 4 at the same time.

12626,"Dear Wargaming, please add Steam link account on World Of Tanks Blitz mobile
I have tier 7 SU-152 and i cant use it/play it anymore,so i have to staet over with my wargaming account.

Plz really add it!"
12627,"Tried playing the game because it looked interesting, downloaded, got into game, stuck in some bug that makes me unable to play as i needed to restock shells for a newbie mission yet the feature was still unavailable, sent in a support ticket, was told this was a known issue and that the devs are ""working on it"" ticket was marked as ""Resolved"" yet still can't play the game.

Actually unplayable, so negative review, might change in future if this changes."

EDIT: After an additional 1724 hours played, I can safely say that this game has become:
Even more trash."
12635,not the best but not the worst......tho ya should know all the games from wargaming.net are pay to win and they suck
12636,very good game
12637,"For a Mobile-based game, this is one of the best you can get. Not strictly bound to mobile, which means people who have previously played WoT on the PC version could use their keyboard and mouse. The developers look into feedback they receive and change the game accordingly to the comments."
12638,"so far, even for me this game seems fun, and I hate hate slow clunky controls like these. although from my first impression it seems like i is one of those games that you can only play every now and again otherwise it would get very stale. after i have either played enough hours that i stop playing i find in so fun that i end up pouring 100s of hours into this game i'll do another review! :)"
12639,"Bad servers make game totally unejoyable  ever since update 6.0 has dropped game has basically became unplayable in the evenings herein Australia . Basically whenever traffic in game increases because of new tanks/ free tanks the hampster powered servers in this game cant cope . Wargaming seem to be totally indeffrent and do not get back to if you try reach support . i foolishly have bought tanks and youd think the'd care about paying customers ,but my experience with support is no they dont .

12647,exciting play
12648,"biscuitssssss
"
12649,"as someone who put prob way to much time into this, it's a pretty good game. The real turning point for me was when they made some line that are a normal grinding to get what you want, in the normal game to you have to pay to be able to play. *COUGH* AMX 30b. And with lag, ping problems. They really need to pay attention in to the game problems and not just the content that's in the game. :) you're welcome Dev member's for some advice you should look into."
12650,"This game is fun and offers a realistic gameplay of blitz,  I have been playing for 4 years, and I have over 1000 hours, before I even installed it on steam.  It can be played through pc, mac, and tablets which makes cross platform play even easier. I recommend this game for people who like PvP play and tanks/war."

There are some nice Battles that you can get into here, the Tanks also look nice. Cool is also that you can play this Cross-Platform ^^"
12656,"Player base is toxic and full of trolls, hackers (can be done somehow) and 12 year old CoD player after their parents banned them from playing it after watching them do that one mission in World at War when you burn the Japanese defences.

If you are good at the game you're a noob and if you're bad you are the best fucking player and everyone is shit and deserves to be cleansed off this planet.

It is a good game to play on the side and the steam version is a step in the right direction from the mobile version aside from what I said at the start which IS TRUE BE CAREFUL OUT THERE!"

It's a pay as you play game though it portrays itself as being free."

12678,"this game is AWSOME. no question it soooooooo fun.
"
12679,it's good
12680,"This one is in a better state than PC WoT and it's more fair (+-1 MM). Even looks pretty good, considering that it is primarily a mobile game.

Before heading to battle: make sure you've got your tank equipped as well as possible (parts, upgrades and [b]consumables[/b]) and do your best in the battle. That's all that matter. Don't get frustrated about your statistics if they aren't perfect, it isn't worth it.

I think the monetization model is acceptable. There's nothing you could buy for real money giving you a significant advantage in battle that you can't earn by just playing. However it makes the progress a lot more fluent and enjoyable. You also can't play tiers 9 and 10 very often, because of very expensive repairs and ammo.
However all you really need is to buy one good tier 8 premium tank, like T34, Löwe or maybe FCM 50t, to earn more in-game cash, so you have enough credits to buy and play very high tiers.

You can also get some premium goods for doing daily missions and opening free crates, as well as fulfilling special missions during Christmas or other temporary in-game events."
12681,"Once upon a time... it was good but the dev made it half pay-to-win half ""support the REEEEtards  dont give a damn on players that can actually play the game"".. just don't do it."

Highly recommended if you like tank games and don't have much time to grind."
12690,"One of the best game I've ever played just behind Portal 2. Too fun simulator game but the
ping is not stable at all. I saw a green ping before start a match but when in-game ping is always above 300 (even 1000) or below but loss over 20% too annoy lag as trash. My wr drop too many so its make the game become trashy."
12691,this game is really fun and free
12692,"I've played hours of this on other devices. It's an ok time killer. Graphics are good for what it is. The game play is much simpler than WoT the original game. Battles are quicker which I like. The maps are the same as the original from what I've played, and there may be a few different ones, but I have not played WoT in a while so."

Stupidly P2W, hella boring and seriously? health bars in a tank game?
go play war thunder honestly, save yourself from this burning dumpster fire of a tank game"
12699,its pay to win and super boring. 2/10
12700,i bought an event tank with real money about 30 dollars and it cant do shit thank you for good advertisement
12701,I actually like it. Its faster paced than the OG World Of Tanks and the grind isn't so much of a deal. The graphics are passable and the controls are simple. The game is constantly being updated with fixed bugs and new content.
12702,"if you play heavy tank you = god , because ppl play this game only choose heavy tank , and it have a f*ck ton of armor that you cant even dmg the tank with small tank and medium tank
dont even play this game if you want pay more money to get heavy tank"

12704,Terrible. Super Boring. Its like a cellphone game basicaly
12705,really fun game. also the fact that every month developers publishing updates is amazing ♥
12706,mahh.. boring  !!!
12707,give me more free op tank
12708,I like this game
12709,"See UPDATE #2 below.

At first it seems like Pay 2 Win, but upon further inspection, it really is not and is actually quite well designed for both players and the developers.  Well executed.

UPDATE: While I am still giving this game a thumbs up, I am barely doing so.  The pay to win aspect has increased and continues to do so the longer the game operates.  The developers find many ways to abuse the free to play players in ways that at first appear like they are helping them.

For example... you are saving up gold (premium currency) to be able to buy something; then they make a change to allow you more opportunities to earn gold without paying for it... great right?  Wrong.  Because with this change, they also neglected to mention that premium tanks which cost gold are now, on average, about 2x to 4x the cost similar tanks used to be.  And I do not mean the generic tanks that are always available in the shop: I am talking about the extremely overpowered tanks that randomly appear in the shop as limited time specials.

Not to mention the real money ($$$$) cost of certain limited availability tanks; try anywhere from $59.99 to $99.99 for a single tank... and this is a game where you will want upwards of 20 tanks to use... and don't expect the regular tanks to keep up or, in many cases, even be able to damage these ridiculously overpowered tanks.

UPDATE #2: No longer recommending this game after spending many hours playing it and honing my skills, accumulating a significant roster of tanks I enjoyed.  The developers keep putting ""666"" or ""6666"" etc. in the prices of items on ""sale"".  They just price tanks such that the ""original"" (made up) price is 6,666 or 66,666 gold, and ""discounted"" to some other price.  Too bad.  I won't take the number of the beast for the tiny reward of some video game) or for anything else).  Neither should anyone else.

""Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name. Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority. And I saw one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the world marveled and followed the beast. So they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?”

And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

If anyone has an ear, let him hear. He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity; he who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon. And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived. He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.""

12710,"World of Tanks Blitz on PC is far better than the mobile variant, I won't lie I've spent too much time on this game as it's my Go-To for quick matches. Based on the experience I've gathered I can say this is a fun game, the only issue you will have is the transition of tier 4->5 as the tech tree was balanced a few updates ago, Tier 4s are very underpowered against tier 5 vehicles. But above tier 4 is usually fairly fun (Usually). If you're a new player then I suggest going down the Russian heavy tank line, they rely on decent armor and fairly good guns, more experienced players should try out light tanks, they're far more mobile but have no armor."
12711,"the ""pay to win"" thing is a myth here.
no i'm not joking. for example, i got su 100y from a free weekly crate.
and that thing has the most OP gun in tier 6. and you can get it for completely FREE in the huge crate. and it's the most common tank to get in the crate.
but of course, su 100y as the most OP tier 6 sttill however, could be beaten by a tiny little light tank.
it applies the same with another tanks. you may have heard of the smasher in this game.
but instead of paying to wg or just waiting until you'll get it for free in an event, you can just get the same tank with lower armor. the su 152. and that's, not a premium tank.

there are reasons people calls this game a pay to win game they'll always want to delete:
1. their skills sucks so much that they even struggle to beat a tier 3 tank with a heavy tier 5 tank.
2. they don't know what a company is and they don't know what do they need to keep running this game.
3. they're very jealous to their friends or just a random player.
4. they don't understand what an rng game is and how you should play it.

overall this game is really nice. i want to give you, new player. 2 messages:
1. don't waste your money on crates with lower than 10% chance of getting a tank.the crates doesn't work like:
10 x 10 = 100 which means getting 10 crates means getting 100% chance to get a tank.
no, it doesn't work that way. 
you may see people got a tank in a single crate and you opened 10 crates and gets nothing.
it's still 10% chance of getting a tank even after you buy 100 crates.

2. please don't be a toxic person :'(
this game has got filled by toxic players who don't know how to play time to time.
got mocked by a dumb noob who did just rammed his light tank to a maus and then he died and blame you?
just ignore it and report if needed. sometime wg will do something.

that's it people. thank you so much for reading :)
p.s. : hi"
12712,"bad matchmaking. 

edit: still bad matchmaking

second edit: 2 years after this original review, i can still say: bad matchmaking. oh and its also pay to win."
12713,"Good. It might seem basic, but this was a mobile game first, so this is acceptable.

As with all Wargaming.net titles though, grind becomes extreme once you reach middle tiers. Give up hope of unlocking everything, you will have to be selective, unless you have a) infinite time or b) infinite funds."
12714,"nemuzu stahnout original ale tohle je super nahrada 
jen chybi artyny"
12715,"I used to play World of Tanks regular version for years, since beta, actually and on rare occasions I even miss it now. I played Blitz on mobile and didn't like it but when i noticed it on Steam I thought ""Well, if it sucks, I can uninstall and move on."" I do like World of Warships but I didn't like the whole Wargaming Game Center thing so I never reloaded World of Tanks regular since they try to foist it on you from the beginning. But they didn't do that with Blitz so I took a chance and found out it's fun (for me at least...I guess I missed it a bit). I feel guilty though because a lot of the players probably don't have old WoT experience and I've been like the proverbial wolf in the sheep pasture. I usually have the most team kills and three or four times I've turned a loss into a win (or a draw). It kind of makes you feel borderline awesome....which I'm not. In regular WoT I was an average player but all the little things you learn, like not presenting your side to the enemy team, angling your front end to get more ricochets, using cover, just basic stuff that this current crowd still need to figure out. Then, when they do, I'll go back to being average :/  So my point might be this: if you're an old WoT player or someone who can grasp some common sense tactics fairly quickly, you might find yourself having a good time. I have no plans to dump money into this thing but you don't really need to if you're patient....just enjoy every match. And if this doesn't appeal to you...have fun no matter what you play!"
12716,"this is pretty much world of tanks for people who:

a. hate artillery
b. have a low end pc
c. want to play with friends who only play on mobile
d. dont have a lot of storage

10/10 would recommend."
12717,"The game was good but after the 2019 update the game became bad and why is the game hungry for money and why the fuck is there a gold tank for £43.99 who the fuck is going to buy it. You just made the game more boring and please put back the old tanks that you took out the game . Also why dont you redo the Girls Und Panza event and add the french camo too (dont see why not) And the game is full of noobs that cant stop being toxic so please add a report thing in . If you have the time then why not LOWER THE FUCKING PRICES . Its all for money, if you want to win then your gonna have to pay."

12724,"
Gameplay is 6/10
Gameplay is Okay. In this game, balance between vehicle is good. Wargaming still plan for further update and event.
But, matchmaking system is really bad and getting worse after several updates.

From my point of view, many players are toxic. No tactics and strategy! AFK! Trolling! 

Graphic is 8/10
Graphic still normal for this age. I don't expect for higher graphic. Because, mobile phone is main platform. 

Overall is 7/10
This game looks quite good from outside. But, I always hate the fact that amount of toxic player is more important than your skill and tactic. I can't play more than 5 battles per day."
12725,"i have trouble with this game after update 7.3, game keep crashing when startup, i tried reinstall but this issue not fixed. Anyone have the same problem?"

12729,"Would not recommend for new players, used to be a fun game, but the developers for some reason removed half of the tech tree (Free) tanks and filled the game with premium tanks, not to mention all of the good players have left and your teams consist of kids who have no idea what they're doing, its basically the fortnite of war games, but even worse"
12730,"It was a nice game, but...... Too far from my country, and also, the thing that ruined the game for me was that we can only form a platoon with 2 players. That was the killing blow for me. Never comming back to this game. Thats Sad."

Sometimes you question if the players on your team really are bots since how shit they perform and sometimes RNG just likes to mess with you. 

Overall I'll give Blitz a 7/10"
12736,has gotten better than before and its alright when starting out. queue times are super short for normal battles grinds are not terrible.

12739,"since the creator feel free to DELETE my review in the app store every time i port one i will flame them here.

This version is no different than regular WOT, the rng is just as rigged/horrible. If it is your turn to lose then might as well just sit there and take it. no point in trying.

So glad the pc one is floundering as this one is. wargaming needs to fade to memory.

I really dont understand how this game has high ratings. The chines bots must also write  reviews."
12740,"First major complaint is the sheer scale of microtransactions that render the game eventually unplayable. second major gripe is there is no way to leave  match once started. third, reload times on the guns are rough, and enemy shells ALWAYS score major hits while you might as well be shooting nerf darts. sat point blank and shot a tank in the rear armor segment. 1/20th of a health bar ding. his return shot crippled me and halved my health. one round.  last but not least, it definately isn't fair to have a tier 5 or higher tanks in a battle with tier 4 and lower tanks. search elsewhere."
12741,"Fire, cover, maneuver, repeat.

For a game that began its life as a mobile port of its popular PC counterpart, World of Tanks, World of Tanks Blitz brings a surprising amount of polish to the table right from your first log-in.

For new players, World of Tanks Blitz presents a unique experience that I can only describe as positional warfare. The small maps and small teams offer a middle ground between a fast-paced traditional shooter, and the grand strategy of World of Tanks PC. Time to kill is measured in minutes, and being a tank, you usually only have one shot in the chamber at any given time. Keen observation and smart team-play will become second nature as you flank, counterattack, bait, scout, and shoot your way through over 20 unique maps, and two core game-modes. Hundreds of unlockable vehicles, separated across 8 different nations and spanning 60 years of armored history provide for a re-playable experience, and a chaotic battlefield, though at the cost of a hefty grind to get them. Two player co-op allows you to load into matches with a friend, which can be a decisive advantage when the teams are limited to seven players.

For PC veterans, you'll be happy to know that in recent years, World of Tanks Blitz has well and truly moved out from under the shadow of World of Tanks. Infamous issues such as artillery, gold rounds, and infallible armor profiles, problems that have been plaguing the latter for decades, are non-existent in World of Tanks Blitz. Clever balancing, and a responsive and passionate dev team have created a community where bugs are stamped out on sight, and balance issues are rectified with diligence. No tech tree has been left behind, and nearly every branch is competitive.

I would be lying if I said World of Tanks Blitz didn’t come with legitimate downsides. Lootboxes and heavy micro-transactions cause for a less-than-friendly purchasing experience, and the learning curve of the game itself can be challenging at times. The graphical fidelity of the game leaves something to be desired, but as of 2021, the game is undergoing a graphical overhaul that promise crisp new textures, and more dynamic lighting in the near future. 

For a game that's both free, and can run on a half-baked potato, World of Tanks Blitz is a great package that provides a lot more value than it should reasonably have any right to give.  Evolving from a small mobile title in 2014, to a multi-platform game with nearly quadruple its original the content and its own E-Sports league, World of Tanks Blitz has come a long way. It has its flaws, but overall, it’s a solid experience that gives as much as you’re willing to put in."
12742,Good until you need booster $$$$$
12743,good
12744,the game's good
12745,Better than cs gone
12746,This game is very simple and lots of fun!
12747,"Great strategy game with more focus on team gameplay, If you're the solo kind of driver it's probably not the best game for you. Lots of tanks decent events but lacks proper tutorial which is much needed. Refer to YouTube for Tutorials on the game as the in game help is basically useless. Fun experience and active community. Cross-platform through PC mac and phones."
12748,"I've played this on and off since it came out 8+ years ago. Shockingly bad game balancing, it ruins a good game. When it works, it's fun.

Edit: thumbs down until they change the balance mechanism. Tired of the whole team doing little damage to the enemy and wiped out by an seemingly invincible team.

Update: game balance is still a joke.

Update: still a joke game, no skill needed, all game outcomes are pre determined."
12749,Things have become much better for PC players. We now have 120 FPS and the battle passes are surprisingly affordable.
12750,Very good game without any mistakes.
12751,I love this game!!
12752,I would like to be able to have a free in game name changer because I don't like my name.
12753,"Tried every online solution I could find to fix the sudden ""Turret locking on a spot in game and not moving"" followed by complete game crash at match end when this bug happens.  Happens about every 2-3 hrs of gameplay overall.
Restarting gives a warning message that settings are too high and caused an unstable crash. 
Impossible for a 1080SLI rig with 32G of RAM / Maximus VI vs the android tablets this was designed for.
Found plenty of others online with the same issues - going on for YEARS.

Try it and see, if you face no Bugs you may have fun.

I'm not sure I can put up with it anymore, CERTAINLY not spend any money on overpriced EVERYTHING.

12754,Why don't you just bring the proper World of Tanks to steam huh?! :p
12755,nice game i bought it on sale and was not disappointed
12756,not a big fan
12757,"[h1] Honest Review of [b]WoT[/b] [/h1]

World of Tanks Blitz is a strategy based shooting game, where you not only control the tank and maneuver it, but also you constantly use the mouse to aim and shoot at the enemies. The game is fortunately free of charge, so anybody can download it if they wish. You might be asking - [i]'' Well how the heck did you find out about this game? ''[/i] It has a very simple answer: From my friend, who is way more experienced than I am. He basically spends hundreds of dollars on World of Tanks' items, isn't that insane? Anyways, the graphics are fantastic, so is the performance. If you have a low-end computer, like I do, this game will not make you suffer, believe me. The reason that you might want to play this game over and over again is, that it differs from an arcade game, which is repetitive and does not have an end. This game has constant updates of new tanks and new events, which makes this game more playable and addictive. I have also tried the classic World of Tanks (The one without Blitz), but I still prefer the Blitz Steam Version, Because it is quicker and way more fun. Everything is on spot and playable. I highly recommend to anyone. It does not matter what your taste is in gaming. Some may like Fantasy or Simulation or Racing games, but would still enjoy World of Tanks Blitz! Thank you developers for creating and updating this game to highest standards."
12758,"Good Game. Chill to play, Even if you have an opponent driving a premium tank you can still win using normal tanks. Missions are good. Events are neat also, because you can acquire special tanks if you participated in the event. Graphics are fine. Gameplay is good, easy to understand and maneuver. Enjoyable specially if you love world war 2 and history. Audio is also good you can switch to english or to the native language of the tank (tank commander talks when in game like describing if the shell hit or not, or the status of your tank when hit. it doesnt change the overall language if you select the audio to its native languange, just during the game for better tank experience) . So far the game is quite neat to me.

Match making is kind of unfair sometimes specially if you use your new tank. They give you an opponent with fully unlocked modules. You be there just like a slow moving (depends on your tank) with small fire power (depends again on your tank) advancing to a fast moving tank while doing circles and firing you or just idling in your face while shooting you. Without you harming the enemy due to their double plated armour. Then youd be there sitting and cursing that your newly purchased tank is weak af. But it gets stronger until you unlocked it all. So dont worry. you can crush them with ease"
12759,nice game
12760,Blitz is good for mobile but on pc i would recommend WORLD OF TANKS
12761,second time have app already running at startup getting very annoying been locked out for a week first time now again ??? grrr
12762,"I have played this game since 2015 (on my phone) and now play on my laptop. Like any MMO it can be an awesome walk in the park, an action packed fight scene, or just pure frustration. You play the game in 7v7 battles with other players where the objective is to win. Playing these battles allows you to upgrade your tank and get better, new tanks. The tanks come in tiers, the higher tier the better it is! Tier 1 is the basic tanks and tier X (or 10) are the mac daddy tanks where all the very skilled players duke it out. The game takes time to learn, skills like situational awareness of the battlefield and aiming, and decision making are key. I don't have the best skills, but I still get those games where I deal 3-4k damage while having a blast.

 Online interactions like chatting can be useful for teaming up but it's also where some people vent their frustration at the enemy. I have been guilty of doing that before :/. The bright side of chatting with everyone is being friendly and everyone being reminded it's just a game and they should be having fun like you will be after you learn the basic skills. Have fun tanking!"
12763,"The matchmaking seems to be ""loaded"". Progression is based around getting tanks of higher level, that should have better stats, but the stock equipment of the tank is often worse than the best the previous level can offer, and you have to unlock the parts for the tank by playing on them. So, for example, if you just got level 5 tank, it has stats closer to level 4, but will be matched with level 5+-1. My observation may be biased, but it seems that with stock parts you get matched with higher (+1) levels more often than when you have everything unlocked. I don't think that frustration you get because of that is outweighed by the fun you get from good matches.

It's a fun game to play with a friend, but if you are at least half good, be prepared to meet a lot of really bad teammates."
12764,"I will say that I have seen the full World of Tankz a few times around but never thought to play it (looked a bit boring) but I just a few weeks ago watch the anime Girls Und Panzer (which I think could be right to say is my fav anime ever so far)  and saw that this version was on steam so, I went to give it a chance and I am glad I did.

Quick matches - both in match times and waiting times, fun tanks and it is Not pay 2 win as I have never ever paid any money in game and won loads of matches and find it really fun to play and easy to understand.

I have no idea what makes this a Blitz version but I think it's a good game to try for anyone who likes tank games"
12765,i love this game
12766,"Great game, except when your account gets hacked and you lose all the tanks and progress you've made..."
12767,"cool game










"
12768,I hate this WG becuase only on Mobile Platform are getting the Ads not Us using the Steam Platform i really hate this if it will stay like this. please do something
12769,so good game and funny.
12770,"i have a lot of hour of this game before it was even available on steam , the thing is it was a little fun before but now is not working , i mean look at the graphics the phone version is the same it looks like they don't put effort on this game anymore , if i just put the mobile version on pc will be the same feleling . if you realy want a good game wiht tanks i recomad you to check warthunder ."
12771,"Pretty fun version of WoT, 8/10"
12772,GG
12773,"Don`t bother wasting you time.. Rubbish. Admin abuse. Player abuse. Totally Toxic all round.

Its not FREE to play if you want to have fun. You will have to pay real money for fun.  

Pay to win.

Lose mostly.

Tier`s 1 2 3 are fun for a few hours once you reach higher tier`s kiss fun goodbye.

This is about both game`s World of tank`s blitz and world of tanks.

If you want to keep your money and your mind stay well away from both games IMO"
12774,"good

"
12775,"Must have if you're a fan of history and tanks like me! it can be frustrating however if you want to rank up without investing any actual money, you'll be overwhelmed at times by teams of super charged tanks. Great if you want some mindless fun with some tanks for an hour."
12776,good game
12777,"I do actually recommend this game to ANYONE who enjoys any of the following:
- Finicky Hit Boxes.
- Toxic and Cowardly Teams.
- Not being able to see an enemy from a distance although they can see you from the same distance.
- The game punishing you for ""playing badly"" by deducting your currency.
- The Game giving you ""Special Tank Shells"" that are expensive and not effective at all.
If this, in anyway, is what you look for in a game, then be my guest and enjoy but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!"
12778,"Its a fun F2P game with its flaws. You can play trough the game for free without paying a cent, you can even earn the premium currency by watching ads on mobile device, you can also earn premium membership time for free by doing missions in game. Everyone is able to afford all equipment and different types of ammunition without using real life currency, you can even get premium tanks for free from boxes if youre lucky! Now for the not so good parts, devs like to release events that you simply cant complete for free or if you can you have to play for hours and hours every day, sometimes absolutely broken tanks get realeased into the game and break the matchmaking."
12779,Best game ever
12780,"it is pretty nice
"
12781,Very fun and a good time killer. I play it with my friends all the time. Highly recommend.
12782, Awfull bad game. There is no chance to win. Every teammate is toxic coward or kid. You waste your money if buy comething in their shop
12783,nice game
12784,7 out of 10 ok game
12785,its very good game
12786,"When it crashes when you are in a server, you have to wait till the match is over to start the game again."
12787,izi
12788,Actually a great f2p game! Considerable player base also.
12789,Very nice chill game
12790,so fun
12791,"if you don't care for the base wot for whatever reason, this one might be better suited for you. no arty and the games are faster. however my only minor complaint is that at times it feels like the match ups between tanks feel less of who has better armour and strategy, and more who has more hp to tank shells from the other guy. 

"
12792,"Like the idea of a game you can play on both pc and phone but it doesnt work out. This is so much worse than the original WoT, it gets all the bad things from mobile apps, ton of ads, pay to win and lower graphics even on the pc.

It works on phone, let it stay there!"
12793,Fun game blowing things up!
12794,"Ханяю на своей ласточке,ваще проблем не знаю"
12795,Trash Game
12796,"It's fun to play.

Until, you reach tier 4..."
12797,"The heart and spirit of the game have been ripped out. 

Serious players have left and it's all just kids spending daddies cash on the weekly premium tank that came out."
12798,Excellent game - try it...
12799,Way 2 Go WOT Blitz ! Perfect for Me.
12800,gud
12801,"nice
"
12802,Game is pay to win and the items are not cheap
12803,YEETUS YEETUS COMMIT LIFE DELETUS
12804,Amazing.
12805,"for some reason i cant get in, but still the game is great"
12806,"since several tank was removed,the game was ruined by the noob.i hate that,but i wont leave it.WG please fix this"
12807,"Game is laggier by the update, since last update i have 20% loss every game which causes me to not play it anymore, my internet got an upgrade in april but this game is getting worse compatibility by the update, pls fix your compatibility for windows. Any other game runs fine wtihout lagg, Rainbow six siege, Warzone, Battlefield 4 all run without loss or lagg. This game is just broken"
12808,Look I know the updates sucks sometimes but the upcoming tanks update by update is not bad some guys just well quit the game and some wants to keep ongoing and I’m one of them because it was good old times and now we have to face new updates in the future.
12809,"ok game, gun to play with, the stats and tank upgrade is just too much, i don't want to play each tank, just make it so i can freely try any tank i want, the game battle arrange team players with same stage of development any way, so why do i need to research each stage and pay for upgrade on each every part, its ridiculous, its just war game i am not playing a tank technology researcher or tank factory, why do i need to upgrade and research each tank, i just want to play tank battles, make the selection more simple, less stages more selections options, each player has its own preference of choosing what tank it want."
12810,"Good introduction to tanks, ballistics, team support and strategy. 5min battles with choices of different tank countries, ammo,  and average graphics.

After learning the basics, good idea to invest your time into the actual world of tanks with RPGS, improved graphics, better community, and harder strategy. Or if you want more than just tanks, I play war thunder in VR for more immersion. 

Overall, great game for beginners with lower end computers.

My Setup:
I7-5960x OC 4.2 MHz
1080, 16GB"
12811,"3 Things that will make you crazy in this game:
1) Endless red dot notifications that can't be turned off on Mac or PC. Spend the first 3 minutes after logging in to deal with this annoyance.
2) WG encouraging low skilled (and others) players to move up the tiers quickly. This ruins game play for the more capable players. They can't do damage or win games at Tier 1 then how is facing them with better opponents going to help? You'll lose a lot to stupidity and cowardice.
3) There are Latin American and North American servers - sort of. You may end up with a team of South Americans who don't speak English (or play very well) and you have no control over it."
12812,the most stupid game ever  world of tanks is  way before  better
12813,good game amazing gameplay
12814,"Been playing this game for ages on IOS (since 2015), found out it was on Steam and Auto aim works much better on this platform. also a lot more enjoyable on PC."
12815,ok
12816,"i love this game, tho there is one thing that i wish that the developers added, and that is [u] animated tank suspension. [/u]

otherways i rly like this game (and im a free to play player, not a big fan of the pay to win aspect of this game, but developers have to earn the money in some way, XD)"
12817,"This game is flawed and I wouldn't recommend it to those with gaming rigs. Other players nail you and you lose 400 points or instant kill. You nail them, with your most expensive ammo, and you get either a ricochet, no pen or only half of what they get. I believe that this game is disgustingly biased towards players using mobile devices, that or everyone is using some cheat engine. Don't care what comments people leave, this game is a mess, it wasn't this bad when I first played it, now it's just disgusting."
12818,THIS GAME IS AWESOME. JUST LOOK MY TIME I PLAY THIS GAME. THIS GAME IS WORTH IT
12819,What is the point of releasing a phone game on a PC?
12820,its an ok game runs and looks decent for what it is.. Still has the same broken match making as the orignal version tanks are poorly balanced and a few of them are lower tier then they should be looking at you matildia..
12821,i do recommend this but amount of pay to win is high but still a good game
12822,Lol XD I love tanks...
12823,Bought a new laptop and felt like using the account from my iPhone. Logged into Wargaming.net and proceeded to download game. Game downloaded and made me go through tutorial.  Made me create new account. Searched for how I could merge my iPhone account to my laptop because I'm pretty sure there is a way. Searched for like 15-20 minutes and found nothing helpful. Stopped searching because I didn't feel like wasting my time and deleted the game shortly after. Probably deleting the one on my phone too.
12824,nerf KV2
12825,"this game is really good for low end pcs 

like my laptop
"
12826,wheres artillary
12827,"На мобиле начала сливаться, запихнули сюда. Зачем? Кому это нужно?
Игроки ПК играют хуже, чем мобильники. 

Просто игроков стало не хватать на мобилах, вот и пихнули, не терять же строки. И здесь кто нибудь на донат купится, благо таких людей хватает."
12828,"G'day from Austrailia! i hear a LOT of people saying world of tanks is pay to win, this could NOT be further from the truth!
Yes u can buy premium tanks that cos IRL money but these tanks all have there weak spots as all tanks do such as low damage low armour etc.                         

  ~ALL TANKS CAN KILL ALL TANKS~(Yes some tanks are better at different situations then others)

As for the micro-transactions you are not forced to use it, it is mainly for premium and gold which i have found are not necessary to win games (premium has no effect on the actual tanks) and premium ammo does not require IRL cash to buy them

Most of the negative reviews come from players with under 100 hours or even 20 hours gameplay, i do not feel that these people have the right to ""nay-say"" so to speak as they have not really experienced what the game has to offer (or built up any real skill) 

Give the game a go..... learn skills....kill people.... its good fun and u got nothing to lose :)"
12829,"After getting to high tier you will struggle unless you pay, just like every WG game pay 2 win ofc"
12830,"This is the most ""PLAY TO WIN"" game i have seen on the internet.Even with the micro-transactions nobody can go ahead in the game without playing. The main purpose is to buy more and more tanks and the only way to do it is to play. Totally recommended you should play and its also not that hard. Have got about 500 hours playtime on this game on my other account so i know how it is. The game is surely dying...."
12831,"Minor balancing issues. Overall a great game and an enjoyabe exprience.
Balancing issues can be fixed easily, only if Wargamin actualys listened to their players..."
12832,"A good and very tactical game,could be boring at first times but when you improved yourself,you'll have fun."
12833,"the graphics in this game are potato quality you can earn things way to quick...

try war thunder honestly"
12834,swiss piss
12835,"Fun and challenging, sometimes feels a bit grindy and like you have to pay a little bit if you dont want to grind for 3 hours, but other than that is a very fun game."
12836,"If you play this game as anything but russia you will hate it.....  Don't ever fool yourself or forget, no matter how fun other stuff looks just play all russia and you will enjoy the game."
12837,"Terrible Cash Grab! From the minute you launch the game you are bombarded with ads asking you to upgrade premium this and to buy that. Its awful. The playerbase is either filled with bot accounts designed to look like players or trolls who will block you by driving their tanks into you. 
 I would as of this point avoid games like WoT or WoBS or World of what ever games. 
Seems to all just be a cash grab trend."
12838,"Horrible. Do  not waste your own time. Look at the reviews. Ive played many hours on console and having the problems they did there, they seem to do the same here but far worse. PAY TO WIN and horribly designed economy. 06/01/2019 Ive played probably 15 more hours since review. New updates have brought no real change to gameplay or balance. Still a pretty shite game"
12839,"
The matchmaking is for the ass. my shit in the toilet is more productive than this matchmaking that is guaranteed to have been programmed by a disabled person with missing limbs. oh forget it you can not even call program because it was shot on the keyboard, it smeared properly and with a dildo on it and finished the matchmaking"
12840,"This could be a tremendous game. Unfortunately its not properly managed. The ""free"" version is equal to that ""just try it"" pop you get from a drug dealer. It's just there to get you hooked and it works. Then your troubles start. I did the pay to play with all the bells and whistles for a while before I was able to escape. In truth I would have never stopped. I loved playing this game. Let me go over why I had to kick the habit.
 First, it's expensive to play. A year is close to $100 US if all you spend the purchased game currency on time to play.
 Second, balance is off bad. Historical vehicles are completely whacked. In game play it doesn't matter your country tree you pick your tank will not be accurate with regards to function. This could be easily controlled by adjusting the purchase and maintenance cost of your chosen vehicle but instead the game designers just made them at best equal or in some cases biased. You can also expect to be up tiered in almost every engagement.
 Third and worst of all in my opinion, the cheating is absolutely rampant. You can't hardly play in a match where there aren't more cheaters than not. Aimbot, map, and texture hacks abound and yes they make that much of a difference. I played without them and with them. Yes that's right I paid the $14.95 a month fee for the cheats (probably also the developer?). I wanted to see exactly how much of a difference they made. Well it's substantial. I won't go into detail but believe me on that. Problem is you'll need that to be competitive and that just sucks.
 I did enjoy this game. I would pay to play without hesitation. But they have to fix the cheating. Just my two cents and I hope it helps someone out there."
12841,its fine but needs new content
12842,"what is not to like, easy to learn but hard to master, definitely a team co-operation is needed, thinking is involve and you get to learn about tanks, very cool. the graphics are good, and the tanks move excellent"
12843,The game is not bad its pretty good and very addictive lots of cool tanks graphics of water insane awesome.
12844,it's a fun game but an unbalanced game.    It will lure you into spending more money for gold and credits.   You pay for something like camo for your tank and then it will disappear.   You are in a team of seven against another team of seven and sooner or later you will noticed that your team will be under powered with unexperianced player.
12845,"Excellent battle game - especially if you love the thrill of the chase, the dodge of the incoming and the smell of  cordite.
Oh and if you like blowing stuff up this is THE game.

Great graphics, quick short battles so you don't get board, if you die early in the battle you can watch other players for tips on tactics etc.

And it's free!"
12846,I think the game is really not balanced... Heavy tanks of the same level hit more than destroyers tanks.
12847,pretty bad game its okay at first if you have no other games but after that do not play it.
12848,"Yes just Yes
"
12849,Fun game if you have the patience to grind alot.
12850,it is a brillant and entertaning game
12851,"whats up with all these Server maintanance in the am
"
12852,great lightweith game
12853,"Way too much kid in this game. The developers are idiots and brailess pigs and they care just their money. Dont worth the time. Some looser make a ""historycal"" tank shooter... pfff."
12854,Better balance if comparing with its elder bro WoT.
12855,niceeee
12856,Trash game
12857,Where is my all tanks? I just opened the game and my all tanks are gone thank you so much
12858,"Some good stuff right here, although not as realistic as War Thunder, it has it's own charm."
12859,"First off.
Do not get this game at all if you're expecting some sort of ""fun arcade tank game""
This game is highly frustrating, coming from a player who's been playing since summer 2017. There are elements that just ruin the experience and overall gameplay. Where do I even start...

-Some tanks are much better than others, some being completely overpowered and ruin matches for people trying to grind basic lines
- if you're free too play, well. Kiss your social life goodbye because this game takes ages to grind through. Literally.
- Once you start, you're a new player. Correct? People who are good at this game will literally S*&@ on you if you don't know what you're doing. It takes forever to learn basic game mechanics, learning how to use your tanks correctly, etc.
- It's Pay2Win. It just is. If you don't hand over your money to wargaming this game is 1000x worse.
- The playerbase is highly toxic, if you're expecting some kind of daycare friendship crap, just no. People are highly toxic in this game and will get mad at everything you do wrong.
Lastly
- RNG.

RNG (Random number generator) is the lifeblood of this game. It determines where your shots will land, if you pierce the enemy armor, how much damage you do, basically everything. If you get ""bad RNG"" your match is ruined. ""Good RNG"" allows you to do good matches, and win. 

It's a matter of luck. Doesn't matter how skilled the player is, you need to understand that RNG will always find a way tor f*&@ your day up.

So, any person interested into getting this game without having any experience with AFV fighting games. DO NOT GET THIS GAME. Trust me.

Edit (2021): 

Don't get war thunder. This game is fine if you can handle carrying teams constantly and you have the soul of a monk. Don't rage, ezy peasy."
12860,"greate game but i which there's no pay2win , but still i love these game which are like this game in the controles and shotting type :))"
12861,"Worst game ever. It is not even ""pay to win"" game it is ""pay to play"" otherwise you must constantly grind. It is PVP but nothing you can do because of it totally depends on your teammates. But you cannot chose teammates they are random."
12862,Platoons of 2 people? What a joke. Mediocre game for you and a singular friend to play together. Cash shop is ridiculous and the gameplay isnt even that fun.
12863,It alright
12864,this game just enjoyable. there is not much about real tank wars. graphics are just so so.  there are not much tank games there so you dont have much choice.  its free to play so dont lose it while its free
12865,"After a playing this for a few hours here and there, I finally got the Panzer IV tank I wanted, I put the game down for a little while, upon picking it back up all my progress was gone after a recent update. Needless to say, not impressed, promptly uninstalling and forgetting this game. 

Thank you for wasting my time where I could be playing better games"
12866,very boring after a few hours ONLY 3 MAPS
12867,"Pros:
- Short-timed matches (max 7 mins, usually 3~5 mins) which welcomes you to play when you can't afford to play long-timed games.

- Satisfying explosions. (on a kill)

- Cool tanks in play. (personally)

- A variety of playstyle available through 4 unique tank classes and replaceable modules on most tanks.

- A wide selection of camouflage paints. (but mostly pay-to-apply)

- Relaxing or fun training rooms. (aka custom matches)



Cons:
- A rough-and-ready tutorial which only teaches you 2% of the whole game, also wasting much time than it should have. (they could make the tutorial more informative and time-worthy)

- Plays are highly dependent on teamwork and in-depth game knowledge. (see why this is a problem below)

- Mid-to-high tier matches are flooding with premium tanks. (which brings hordes of wallet warriors (but not every) who don't even know how their own tanks work, or disturb your role / disable your viability without knowing it, ultimately ruining the game)

- Kids and overgrown kids(calling themselves adults) who only know to blame and insult you whenever things go wrong.

- 'Bad connection' or 'Away from keyboard' users flooding the matches, de-balancing almost every match. (especially annoying when you got those on your side)

- Highly unstable shell landing identification. (shots passing through enemy and hit the wall/ground of the other side even when you definitely shot through, bouncing shell even if it indicated 'pen-able'(except spaced armors), etc)

- Daily quests asking you to play the game mode you don't.

- Autocratic, unfair, or even exclusive room hosts managing the training rooms. (sometimes you meet a good and fair host, unless you create your own room)



'Duh's:
- Useless user appraisal indicators. ('abusing' users still roaming around the game, and not every 'trustworthy' users are skilled or anything)
- 'Limited-time sales' returns again after a few months. (halt when you're up for a purchase and decide whether the current purchase might be better then future purchase as it's going to be on sale at the future)



Do you have WoT PC? Then play that, trash this game.
Do you have War Thunder? Then play that, trash this game.
Do you want a WW2-themed game? Then trash this game, this is a 'fantasy game' disguised under WW2.
Do you not care about realistic interactions but shoot-and-smash? Then play this game.
Do you have no decent PC but have a smartphone? Then play this game.
Did you play this on phone/tablet before? Then play this game.



Summary: 
There should be anything worth your time than this game. If you really got time and money to burn... go on :3"
12868,"Great game, I play it casually. It takes some grind to unlock good tanks but once you've passed tier V, the game gets challenging and therefore, fun."
12869,"I enjoyed so many hours of this game just to see how my account is ""cursed""!! I don't want to mention that I almost have 10 tier 10 tanks, I bought a lot of gold and put so much effort in this game and finally noticed how great ""improvements"" are. They give us updates about stupid premium tanks and new maps but don't care of improving a game itself.. i stopped playing this game just for stats cuz I'm sick and tired of my accound RNG being sh*t hall the f*****g time! I always join a 40% team when my opponents are 60%... How bout that? How's that f*****g fair huh? I don't care about this game if I don't enjoy it, and fix your stupid matchmaker finally!

Second to mention, everyone can buy themselves a tier 10 now, I played 6 years to get one but now if u buy one ur set for life because ur to OP for this game since there is no tier 11!!!! No one can pen u, u give insane amount of damage and get sh*t load of credits..

I can't even describe these stupid imaginery BS sh*ts.. insane dpm, great RNG and OP

Toxic community and people are just bad at this game so they blame the entire team

Don't get triggered about this I still can get a win in 15 loses in a row but that's just my account, if you have a great RNG in a matchmaker ur so lucky and be proud of that!! Value ur progress and don't give up! I still play and break my nerves but I will never give up so don't u!"
12870,Tanks are just tanks
12871,"ehh for those who think this game is a p2w games, you're just bad at this game... if you are a casual player then that doesn't matter at all, but if you really wanna win, it takes time to learn the game mechanics. Stop complaining about the game being p2w when you don't even know how to reset your camo or cod lol."
12872,Good time killer.
12873,good
12874,"terrible input lag, makes it almost impossible to play. can't steer, cant aim, cant lead shots. download it through the Microsoft Store, no input lag."
12875,"this game, and the hub, steam behind it prjovides security and alot of fun"
12876,"World of Tanks Blitz is, at it's heart, World of Tanks PC from around 2014-2015 or so. The graphics, tech trees, and engine are all pretty much the same as they were back then. It suffers from all the old problems World of Tanks once had, as well as the new hyper-aggressive microtransaction system prevalent across Wargamings remaining titles. While one could argue World of Tanks has always been ""pay to win"" to some degree, that has never been more true than for Blitz players- where mobile gamers on tablets will face players on desktop PCs with proper keyboards and mice to control their vehicles, adding an extra layer of power to the ""seal clubbers"" rampant across the lower tiers. The biggest advantage Blitz has over World of Tanks PC version now is that it lacks the hated self-propelled artillery class of vehicles, but that alone is not enough to save this game.

In my opinion, Blitz is an inferior version of World of Tanks- which has itself collapsed in recent years under the pressure of corporate greed and mismanagement. There are a lot of tank games out there that will allow you to command and drive the best tanks of World War Two- I advise anyone looking for such an experience to explore those alternatives."
12877,This game sucks so fucking boring
12878,"As much as I dislike it, I always come back to it.
It is definitelly P2W (the grind is otherwise really hard), but you won't notice this until you're playing Tier V and above. However, playing lower tiers isn't as much fun as it used to be since the last update which took away many of the low-tier tanks. I understand that this is to make going up the tiers easier and less time-consuming, but it also takes away many of the fun tanks, such as MS-1, T-46, Luchs etc. The only bonus I see from this is the removed French TDs, those were some really bad vehicles. While It's nice you can sell these tanks for some gold, if you still have them in your garage, I feel like Wargaming should've compensated us, more advanced players, much better.
Edit: Apparently in this version you cannot input special characters when logging in with a password. Why oh why are the devs so incompetent."
12879,"To be honest, I played the other world of tanks a lot too, but I'm having a lot more fun in this one, I don't really know why. The battles are a bit more balanced, they're smaller ( 7 vs 7 ) which I preffer better than 15 vs 15 and it's a bit more simple, easier to understand for people who don't really play games a lot. Oh, and I also have a premium tier 8 tank from the free weekly crate so I don't have to struggle making 5k per match with the normal tanks. Nontheless, a great game that I will probably keep playing for a pretty long time, and you should too."
12880,"Great game. I prefer War Thunder if you can get it, but this has WAY WAY more tanks in the game. I LOVE IT!"
12881,Very good game but the servers are acting up please let me know when they are back up.
12882,Nice and relaxing game to kill the time. Not a lot of boring children who kill the fun. Reminds me of the times when COD2 multiplayer was popular. Good old times. One can use real money to get some stuff like premium tanks and to speed up upgrading but I find it not needed unless you really really want that special purple blue tank or something. Grind on for and hour or two and you will get the same thing as if you payed 20 euros while also improving your skill. Cheers !
12883,It's decent.
12884,Tonky Tanks
12885,Good way to waste alot of time
12886,"If you're into tanks (and microtransactions...) then this game is, uh, for those who don't know how to wisely spend they're money. But in all seriousness, probably the best online tank game out there."
12887,"world of crap blitz


he he

-babom (funny)"
12888,fi u think this game need p2w u r a fukin cunt
12889,they say it has real players but after a couple of games i realized they're just bots.
12890,"Good game, but a bit addictive, so be careful. Notice that the word addictive it's not used in a positive way, because addictions are never good. The game mechanics push you to play more and more to grind new tanks. The battles are fast and intense, normally 5 minutes. It's not a pay to win game. You can pay for premium tanks to get tanks that make you grind more credits faster. But premium tanks are not necessarily better than the others in combat, overall it's a pretty balanced game. Skills matters much more than the tank."
12891,really good game to play.
12892,"gay not good moblie port and gayest
"
12893,One of the most fucken unbalanced games in the fucken world. Purely awful.
12894,Good strategic game 👍👆
12895,There are tanks lol
12896,I would recommend this game to try it.. It's free and it's so addictive tank war game. Graphics are so great as well as the gameplay. 5/5* for me!
12897,"Pretty good, ive been playing for a few years (off steam) and have gotten to tier 8, it can be frustrating, but in the end, its so satisfying to play, definitely reccomend!"
12898,P2W Nightmare.
12899,This game ok for noobs and pros....... I liked it on the starting but later it became boring .....  but must try
12900,wow
12901,pay to win game :/
12902,over all I enjoy the game but it has a Pay to win system with higher tier ammo only being available with gold coins that have to be purchased.. this need to be fixed
12903,"It's a fun game. I've been around for a longer time (From came from mobile years ago), deleted the game and now I reinstalled it recently. It's gotten a bit more fun to play around, excluding the insults teammates will throw at you aside, but overall it's fun if you have a good friend to play with.

The grind can also get a bit ""ugh"", but I don't let it get to you.

I'm Tier VIII/8 at the making of this review"
12904,"With steamplay I can play this on my chromebook! :D
Super fun I play this any chance I get"
12905,"Look. I've always been the kind of guy who likes fast paced fighting games, like Halo, Overwatch, and Fortnite, World of Tanks is very slow paced (which makes sense because tanks aren't all that fast), but for some reason I really like it. World of Tanks is very entertaining, whether or not you're looking for a casual and less hyperactive fighter, or something to swing yourself into full gear and show the internet what you got, and the fact that it's free makes it a whole lot better. Go on, try it, you got nothing to loose."
12906,dont even. dont. just. believe me
12907,Old game but I kinda like it. They could add more to make it better but they don't listen to the players.
12908,"Always return to this game. Really simple easy to play hard to master. Fun, free."
12909,"World of Tanks is a global phenomenon, already tens of millions of players are playing tanks.  After conquering PCs and attacking consoles, the developers are launching an assault on mobile devices.  And it looks like this operation will be successful.

[h1] Smaller doesn't mean worse.  World of Tanks Blitz is a great mobile game. [/h1]
Pros:

Accessibility.

Very good (for tactile) control.

You can even play on a 3G connection.

Short loading and waiting times.

Nice setting.

Minuses:

Gold from your World of Tanks account cannot be used.

The quality of the fun largely depends on the skills of other players.

Poorly implemented FB integration.

Rating: 9/10"
12910,wery good game . a little bit p2w
12911,Good Game But A Lot Of Pay To Win
12912,This Game was a masterpiece back in 2014 when the World was still a calm and gud place but nowadays one OP line after Op Line enters the Bttlefield. And now they want to ad dynamic armor for tanks to become more op and noob friendly ? sorry but i cant stand this anymore this games sole purpose is to attract new players and fck over players that have been playing for years THX Wg another game ruined by you stupid Money Focused greedyness
12913,"Don't bother touching this one, just download the PC ver will do."
12914,"Sold My soul wtf am i doing

Biggest pay to win ever
You Can Spend 1k usd and not even get a teir x
Dont play
save ur self"
12915,"As of update 7.1 people might not like tiers 6, 7 and 8 anymore because of how broken they are, but the game is still enjoyable."
12916,its ok
12917,just a dumber version of wot and annoying after playing the real one.
12918,"I played this game to the point of Tier VIII tanks back in 2019. It was 100 hours of game time, excluding what i did on my phone. I LOVE the game and I honestly don't know why. It just feels fun and there is always progress to be done which I love. Anyway i've recently restarted the game on a new account (in game so same steam account) and can't wait to relive this game"
12919,Got boring for me fast
12920,Amazing game ive played for like  2 years +
12921,"I want to redact my orginal review of this game. They fixed a lot of the in game currency issues. They also installed a lot of little bonuses help you save currency, and come back the next day, installing excellent replay incentives. The devs make daily, weekly, and monthly updates. They have mini events with awards. I thought it was important to make a new review, and take down my negative review, so new players could have an honest feel of the game."
12922,"I was a long time WoT player but due to life and work commitments I had to reduce my playtime. When Blitz came out, it gave me a shorter pick up and play time, was still a lot of fun and I didnt have to make the same commitment that I had in the main game. It's not as good - but it's still fun!"
12923,"       I highly recomend this game, I like this game for it's many different vehicles from multiple nationaltities and the fact that it is difficult to advance quickly making it a good challenge for the player. This game has many challenges and missions I like this because it has a goal to complete that can be very chalenging somtimes, it also is a very great game for the fact that you fight on a team and can choose to team up with a friend in a platoon.  definitely a great game to play."
12924,"y would any1 play this? / pc version


-1"
12925,P2W
12926,not as good as war thunder
12927,"this is basically a shit version of a shit version of war thunder

dont bother with this or the proper version just get warthunder on steam instead its better"
12928,Very fun!
12929,pay2win
12930,"you have reach the god level (ping 999), your tank can now teleport and sink into the ground."
12931,i have 1888 hours in game this say evrithing for game :D
12932,"Here is my opinion:

The old version (3 years ago) was much better. They removed EXTREMELY FUN tanks to play, such as the t82 glass cannon, and nerfed various other tanks that were never even overpowered, such as the t2 light (its gun is useless even in tier 1-2 battles, forget tier 3). I don't have many hours on steam, but I played on mobile when it first came out in the app store 4 years ago. sure the game is more polished, but the reason blitz was good in the first place was because it didn't have things the pc version did, making it much simpler, intuitive, and enjoyable. Looking at the game now, it appears as though its being created into more of a mobile-pc version, with very developed tech trees.

What the developers SHOULD do is return old tanks back to the tech tree (re add tanks which were removed) and keep the new tanks they added as well. Each line should be equally developed, not Germany with so many tanks you have to scroll down, and Japan with only one line. The game seems as though its optimized to rush into mid tier tanks, but it seems as though somebody failed to see that a LOT of fun can be had playing even with some tier 3's. Thank god the kv-2 ,isu, kv-1s, hetzer, and tortoise weren't removed. The original feel of the game is gone, but it can still be easily revived. 

For the sake of grinding to higher tiers, I will give this a thumbs up, as removing lower tier tanks and adding boosters does make it a bit faster to get up there. The game is a bit smoother, even though old map glitches were fun. However even as a tier 10 player, i cannot emphasize how much fun it is playing lower tiers as well."
12933,Just avoid this game.  Its no fun at all.
12934,"I do not recommend this game.
"
12935,"not bad, children will use words they shouldnt but whatever its not war thunder but its still an okay game"
12936,it's not bad game tbh
12937,"Typical pay to win game... Win like crazy early on then after while get constantly stuck with tanks 2 lvls higher, trying to force you to pay money for premium and upgrades..  3/10  good for a few hours of distraction, don't waste your money."
12938,Yea its aight
12939,"Terrible game is terrible. Who would have thought. 
Apparently this is the mobile version which would explain why the controls are so bad. Doesn't explain why 9 out of 10 teams I got literally sat in the middle of the map doing nothing.

Game should be removed and/ or replaced with the full version.
"
12940,"Игра очеть хорошая, иногда мне самому приходится тощить всю игру но мне это не меншает наслаждатся ею, чтож не буду тенуть и скажу как есть игра итлична всем графикой, мадэлями техники, игровым движком:),и т.д. Короче ира сюпер..."
12941,Great addictive game! there is some pay to win elements.... but if you get good at the game the pay to win advatages diminish greatly. especially when players buy a tank but they arent any good at the game mechanics. you can jump righ in and play. but i do suggest watching youtube vidios on game mechanics and on the tanks you are good at.
12942,"why dose it take so long to load pls help me and tell me
"
12943,this game is really fun but the only thing i hate is the loot boxes i've never gotten a tank from it
12944,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING......!
"
12945,ewsdxcgvhgjkhklj;kl'
12946,"Played this game for like a million hours on my iPad... since it came out 4 years ago.  Like most games it peaked at about 2 years in, and was truly an amazing game at the time.  But then came PubG and Fortnite which tore into the user base, followed by some mind-boggling bad decisions on Wargamming's side that turned their most dedicated core into has-beens (myself included) followed by $50 tanks... and well... sadly it is on it's way out in the US.  I think in RU it is still strong... but the other 3 regions are kicking it to the curb.  If you just want to run around in some good looking tanks for some short-enaggements... maybe a good game for you!"
12947,"This is fuckin pice of shit. This ""game"" is worth a shit from old janitor. You can play the fucking normal and good version, instead you download this piece of garbage. Graphics in this game is vomiting. Dont playy this shit"
12948,no
12949,"Играю уже около 3-х лет, игра очень прикольная,насыщенная!!!Для людей у которые любят подумать головой самое-то!!!Удачи на полях сражений!!!"
12950,"I do not like paying for premium ammo; this decreases the interest in the game and gives a poor impression.
The game is mostly otherwise good."
12951,Pay to loose and designed to get you to want to spend money!!!
12952,"good
"
12953,Don't
12954,.
12955,M
12956,This game is great!!!
12957,"Where do one start.
This is really a great game in all respects.
This is a game for all noobs, new noobs, seasoned noobs and professional noobs because there seems to be a lot. It’s more like world of noobs with tanks. lol.
Being able to have 7 players on a side but reality only have one team mate makes it acutely not a team effort game, because 95% there it no team support. You are alone, due to the selfishness of other players.
Would I recommend the game? 
NO; if you do not have patience then no. 
YES If you have patience, do not mind to be alone and have no support. 
But all in all, great game. love it although the WOT  europe connection sucks. 
""slaaiblaar gaming""
"
12958,"This game is not for you if you want a slightly competent team. Most of the time your team is comprised of retards and idiots. I understand that some players are new and are unexperienced, but when you consistently have shit teams at tier 10, the end game area, you should have more experience. Yet there are so many shit players at high tiers, and consistent bad teams that makes me hate this game.

The Toxic community is also a problem. Half your team is saying you're shit and retarded at the end of a match because your the last one alive. They would be still alive also if they weren't retards and went in one by one dying. Low and behold, at the end you will have done the most on the team, proving that you are better, and the rest of the team is shit. No one here has any respect or discipline.

They also killed some variety by removing tanks in the early tiers."
12959,it's mobile version lol
12960,"this sure is a good game
nice graphic and fantastic gamelplay and variety of tanks
but somehow u cant change ur region and u have to start again if u change it......so im playing on a 300 ping now
plzzzzz wargaming pls fu ing let me change the region"
12961,play warthunder its better than this crap
12962,"looks like the mobile version
"
12963,"Conclusion of my novel:

The devs broke the game.


WOT Blitz review, the Novel:
(I could write 2x as much, but stopped)
(spot system, bad balance in the tech tree, battle pass, broken events, removed free tanks that got added back as paid tanks, maps are not getting updates, some tanks/entire lines are useless etc.)

The game is very simple, anyone can get good at it.
It runs on anything, for real. Natural potatoes included.
It's fun, the games are short.
It's not P2W, but premium tanks provide an easy way into high tiers, with slightly better stats then free ones.

Low tiers (1-4) are introductary tiers, you can get passed them in a couple battles, these are pointless tiers, almost all tanks are the same, there's no challange.

Tiers 5-7 are the tiers where you are meant to learn how to play the game.
These are the tiers where all kinds of tanks are introduced.

Tiers 8-10 are the tiers that give some challange.

So the game gives you an idea on how to progress, and git gud.

Now for the bad part.

WG has no idea about balancing.
They literally kill certain tanks.
And buff others to the point where you see min 2 of them in each battle, cause they're op.

You can buy into high tiers buy paying like 10$ for tier 8.
And you can rush high tiers, it doesn't take more than 1k matches to reach a Tier 10 if you grind for it.
(1k matches isn't that much, ~50 hours for the highest tier)

Most players have less IQ than roblox players.
The community is somewhat toxic.

War Gaming has messed up multiple times recently.

The 2 big ones:

They added tanks with missiles. They are broken, cause you can shoot without exposing yourself. Instead of changing how they work, they destroyed the stats of the missiles to the point where they're useless.

The most OP tank in the game is the Smasher. It used to be very very rare.
But now they gave it away for FREE.
(okay, it was an event where you had to play ~3 hours in 2 weeks to have a 4% chance of getting it)
But technically it means that ~4% of players have it now.
So about in 40% of the matches you have atleast 1 in the server now.

So basicly we have a situation, where tier 6-7 are unplayable due to the amount of smashers and the over buffed tier 7 heavies.
Tier 8 is full of premiums, which can ruin the gameplay for free tanks, unless you're good.
Tier 9-10 is meh, it used to be the same as lower tiers, but matches are much longer.

Match making:
There are 2 kinds of mm:
Casual:
Teams are basicly random. The reason being is that WG doesn't want to ruin the WR of better players by having a balanced casual mm. That's totally reasonable imo.

Rated:
It's meant to be balanced. But from my experience it's the same shit as casual, but more toxic and you can't play in platoon.

There are special game modes, the devs put them in regularily, these are very fun and If, even if I quit the game, I would come back for a few matches in them."
12964,I love the original WoT so I love this one to !
12965,"Not as good as the main WOT game, but still pretty similar in most cases and great to play with your friends who use mobile.

it's also free so... why wouldn't you try it"
12966,"For now I will just call it “neutral”. Your mastery and skill are no guarantee that you will win. It’s all about luck. For example on some spawning places you have more chance to win then on other spawns. As well wargaming considers the game as free, but a lot of things cost money in this game. Gold, tanks, cases, almost everything. My rating would be 6/10"
12967,"why did you guys change it 
"
12968,Залупа конская а не игра?
12969,gud
12970,"DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS GAME IF U HAVE A MIND .
"
12971,Not Bad Att All
12972,My wallets cry
12973,"World of Tanks is a really fun small game that is very easy to pick up and play. Although I lost interest after a few hours, some people love this game and play it for hundreds of hours. The graphics are great for a free game and so is the wide selection of tanks, upgrades and maps.  

This is a very quick game to install and I recommend downloading it because it is free."
12974,UKITNANA NGA AYAYYAM
12975,this game and the engineers that made it really rock.. gj
12976,Nice game
12977,War thunder is better
12978,"extremely p2w

i dont understand why you would ever want to play this game when you could install the original, pc version"
12979,"is good, but not my type."
12980,"A stuning game of strategy, great graphics.
I Recommend it"
12981,I love to hate this game.
12982,I would pay 60$ to actually play a game that ain't pay to win but this pay to win. Fun game destroyed by p2w. F
12983,kinda gay ngl
12984,"So far i've spend £90 on this Pay 2 win game and still nothing has changed i keep playing tiier 7- 10  below toer 7 there all fookin noobs or wastemans, but hwy are the tanks so expensive dafck!!
"
12985,"I do enjoy the game, but Developers can you please clean-up your servers, game lagging very much, or give advise as
to sorting this problem. i would like to reccommend this game to others, but not now whilst ther is so much lagging."
12986,good game. Thats all i can say.
12987,"
i've played this game for many hours and still love it. Almost on 18k battles and not even 1/2 done with the game. So much content to explore."
12988,"its very boring, very hard, full of noobs"
12989,tank
12990,"It's a really cool game, nice work"
12991,This game is disappointing
12992,"ok
"
12993,"Plays Best On Steam!

The mobile version of the awesome tank game. Play on Steam for better controls!!!

Some pay to win elements sadly. But its not game breaking. There is A LOT of game to play here! You can get as technical as you want, learning where modules are, how to position. Or just be casual and drive tanks around and blast people. (Although you'll want to mute chat if you just play casually)"
12994,Coollllllllllllll.All the best.
12995,"This game is all about tanks, that's all, and tank you so much for reading this review."
12996,"How does valve manage to screw this up, but also get war thunder right? I think the head hancho of valve is a war thunder player trying to make a joke, because the original game is way better than this mobile garbage that has been put on steam."
12997,"I want that will be a possibility to connect to Gmail. Because i played a lot in the phone and dont want to start ifrom beginning in the computer . please add it 
"
12998,Good Fun Game. Very fun with mates. Hopefully add more options for battling and more nations. Worth anyones time and money
12999,trash.
13000,great game lots of  choices of tnaks and factions
13001,This is a good game its been keeping me entertained for over a year.
13002,"Don't know why they put this horrible mobile version of the game on steam when the ACTUAL pc version is a whole lot better in every way. I reccomend you get the world of tanks from their website by searching Wargaming on Google.

I wish they would put the more detailed better version on steam, go check it out you'll know what I meean.

Would I reccomend this version?  Definately Not."
13003,"You have a life bar and your bullet deals x amount of damage.  You sit there and fire shot after shot back and forth until one person's health reaches 0.  There isn't any creativity involved, it truly is boring.  Each match you seem to just pull up next to another tank and keep left clicking until one of you die.  

This game is not that great.  It is highly pay to win and they shove Buy me things down your throat every single match.  

The graphics engine is extremely outdated and everything feels super uninspired and old.  The aim cursor for your tank isn't very smooth or accurate.  It feels laggy and unresponsive. 

The levels are bland and boring.  There are several tank battle games out there that are far better.  Warthunder for one.  

Do yourself a favor and avoid this pay to win outdated mess."
13004,War thunder is more realistic than world of tanks and the game looks like it was ment for a ps2 or iphone and the game is boring.
13005,this game is trash... my ipad 2 could run this game in 2020 thats how bad it is -1000/10
13006,pretty not bad
13007,"Mission Passed!
+Respect"
13008,GOOD
13009,"Yes, but no. It's like that one girl you try to forget but just can't. You spend money, regret afterwards, but still keep doing it. Try this game out if you wanna experience what a love-hate relationship is almost like."
13010,Play PC version

13016,"World of Tanks it's the classic game to relax nerfs fighting into an open world WWII maps to fight hard TEAM DEATHMATCH!
If you win you will earn money and experience and you will be able to buy powerfull stuffs 4 your tank until you will got enough money to buy a new BETTER TANK and go on so...!! 
Good gameplay good graphic but the best has yet to come: the reproduction of TANKS is very well done!!

My favourite are GERMAN TANKS which you can got as JAPAN, FRANCE; USA, URSS, ENGLAND and FRENCH*!! (yes it's true) 

But in a second time i felt also longevity brought by the ""HEAT"" against other team... a sane , competitive.. ehm fury, damn..uh MASSACRE GAME that could take you down there too*!!!

 4 Fps lovers but also 4 any curious player."
13017,"A good game with good longevity... the serer access aka ping on the asia server (best for new zealand) is shit.. given that this game requires the odd in app purchase to avoid endless monotony, that is frankly unacceptable... and i is not the NZ based ISP's issue.."

Just make play the legit version.

This was ruined about a year ago by version 4"
13019,"I love tanks, this is lots of fun.  I had a hard time learning some of the game play but overall the graphics are outstanding and it was great."
13020,cool
13021,This is a pretty decent free game.  Several maps to play and tons of different tanks to suit your style.  Games are short and there are always lots of people online.
13022,this simulation game so nice and cool!
13023,Russian tonks not biased very stronk komrade ))))))))
13024,"As a veteran war thunder player, and having played this game on multiple platforms, I honestly cannot reccomend it, it's too difficult, and even war thunder has less bs moments than this does, most of the time you're getting camped by some level 100 who plays only low tier because they have fun in enjoying making new players suffer."
13025,really love this game because of crossplatform making the que faster

13042,Because it's great
13043,"If you dont pay $ you are cannon fodder to the ones that do. You hit them 5 to 6 times they shoot you twice & your gone. You will hear ""Bounced Rite off""  ""You Only Scratched the Surface"" ""You Only Dinged Them"", etc. giving them no damage. A.I. is BAD! You will see A.I ""Player Model"" stuck on rocks & buildings through whole battle & never move or shoot. Team ballancing not so good. Some of the play is fun but the annoying parts kill it. Graphics & sound are bland. Just basic. At least it's free to try.
4/2020 ""UPDATE""- The game claims ""Coop PVE"" but it is a COMPLETE LIE ! There is no coop pve feature. ""THIS IS PAY TO WIN""!!!"
13044,tanks are fun
13045,It's fun but the proper WoT is better imo.
13046,"war gaming  is the worst company i have seen, u will play with a group of idioits in this game and u will always loss game, even u pay money to buy golden tanks, The game matching system is so disgusting that it always sells gift bags and doesn't care about the game's partitioning mechanism."

13050,the game is fun but im having difficulty with it it keeps saying something about error 65 and after a match it kicks me from the game i dont know how to fix the issue
13051,Felt like braindead turnbased shooting.
13052,Fun game with aggravatingly overly complex money grab events that tend to bring down the overall game play. Honestly it'd be a better experience if they just stopped all the events and sold the event vehicles instead. No grinding of 2-3 different tokens just sell them.
13053,not recommend ... want to win this game ? pay
13054,p2w
13055,I use to play some older wot in 2013-2014 found war thunder so much better ps we have boats planes tanks helicopters all In one game.
13056,Its quite fun to start with but progression is very hard without spending lots of money on gold
13057,Got tired of the pay bucks to succeed tactics and the mouthy milenials in the chatstream. Game physics are great as is gamplay but you constantly have to buy upgrades to enjoy it. Would rather upgade my pc and my car.
13058,Nice. Fun and challenging.
13059,A russian contolled game filled with premium bias and overly strong russian tanks. But worse than all this is how weak the german heavy line was made. Hitler would not be proud.

13062,"I'll just say this get used to hear ""You just dinged them"" ""You can't penatrate their armor"" while they blow you up all day. Just BAD."

10/10"
13064,Trash.  Just get War Thunder its well better than this mobile game lookin pile of recycled condoms.
13065,"NEVER PAY THEM ANY MONEY IF YOU PLAY THIS GAME. Pay to Win unless you like abuse.

As you can see in the trend of reviews the 5.5 update has ruined the game. The changes they made are designed to make greedy War Gaming Ltd even more money. The tanks you invested time and or money into get nerfed so that you are forced to buy new tanks or buy gold to upgrade new tanks into being worth playing. Then they will in time nerf those tanks. This is a pure wallet sucking time waster. They are not your tanks, they are Wargaming's tanks and they can do whatever they want to them.  Of course if you don't pay them any money you will play against the toxic kids that do pay them money and they will have the better tankage. As a result of this the player base is dying and what is left is a base of salty toxic foul mouthed kids with mommy's credit card."
13066,It's okay but can be frustrating.
13067,"Game has come a long way down its lagging, most of the interesting tanks are gone or neutered"

13069,this game is pay to win
13070,FUCK all WG.com games. Cash grabbing garbage.
13071,"Was the disparity betweens tier above 3 just not enough for you in PC WoT?

Do you want to spend more than twice the money to unlock an entire tech-tree for a single tank than converting free exp for modules in PC WoT? Getting free exp in PC WoT was just too easy, right?

Were the premium tanks like the Defender in PC WoT just not overpowered enough for you, tanks that you can only unlock by paying or are hidden in-store now because they're only available during limited time events? Was that not enough for you in PC WoT? I mean, you paid money for that tank, you SHOULD be winning!

Was not paying extreme amounts for ammo in PC WoT just no fun? You probably struggle financially in real life, why not in-game too?

Oh boy, do I have the game for you then."
13072,"Armored Warfare is far better.....more modern and realistic while here its kinda cartoonish garbage graphics and outdated. u gotta buy ammunition with gold, and maintenance cost is pretty high. The grind and upgrade is unfair and u always need a premium account.
Do not waste ur time here its simply play to win!!"
13073,"9/10 great game very fun, wish it was less complicated, could use better graphics, but hey! it's free! im not complaining. Gameplay is great."
13074,"LOVE THIS GAME
"
13075,"ididot 9 year old kids play this game. its so bad, they cant play, alvays rushing, Enough."
13076,"This was once a fun and addictive game, one comparable to Smash Bros. HOLD ON! hear me out. it is true that Smash Bros and World of Tanks are drastically different games, but they both had a formula that made them addicting. They're both games that is indeed simple to play and pick up, but takes skill to be good at. All the while providing a wide variety of fighters/tanks to choose from, each with a different playstyle to master. But then everything changed when the gold nation attacked.

But ever since update 5.5, Wargaming's objective has been clear. Nerfing beginner tier tanks does NOT help new players learn. all it tells them is ""Hey. you need a better tank. You need to move up. how do you move up faster? with GOLD. how do you get gold easily? you PAY FOR IT, obviously""... I once loved this game, but WG is now just another greedy money-grabbing company who cares nothing about gameplay. Do yourself a favor and go for Warthunder instead.

Why are we still here? just to suffer? Every shot taken, I can feel my treads. and my turret. even my ammo racks. the guns I've lost. the Tanks I've lost. Won't stop hurting. it's like they're all still there. you feel it too don't you? I wanna make them give back our tanks... but sadly I doubt it.

I hate to say it, but I'd much rather pay $20-$30 for this game than have a free-to-play game that pulls money-grabbing shenanigans like this"
13077,hay
13078,Epic wars
13079,amazing
13080,good game
13081,"Download this if your computer can’t handle World of Tanks. In other case, I see no reasons to play it more than a couple times"
13082,yes
13083,Cool
13084,pay to win
13085,"Even though Blitz is 10 times better than the ""Standart PC"" verion it still sucks.
Why? Cause ""Wargaming"" is an awful and greedy company that can't make any balance in their games."
13086,no
13087,"Good and Bad news...

Good first - very addictive, great fun to play and easy to pick up - you will spend a lot of time trying hard to upgrade tanks and progress. The support staff are rapid - all tickets answered quickly and they do not appreciate abusive players - Which is awesome.

Bad new..

Game base is dying - you can easily wait 15-20 minutes (probably longer but I cant sit down that long waiting) to get a game. 

Really bad news..

If like my son you purchased an in game tank and due to the lack of players you cannot play it - there is no refund or option to do anything with it..

In my honest opinion - do not install this game, there are others on steam that offer just as much enjoyment and have an active fan base."
13088,"World of Tanks Blitz is a online game about tank warfare. The game it's self is not bad at all if not amazing. But it is a mobile port of the pc version. Most modern PCs or laptops can handle the pc version so I couldn't recommend this if you have a modern PC. Now if you have a older this is a great game to play. 
Only complaint I have is the tanks that are payed have better speed and mobility. Which is a unfair advantage to the other players. But, then again it is a free to play game."
13089,"basically runs on a potato, not like PC WoT with a f****** russian yelling in your ear, grind is fun, if you dont have 60 fps, somethings wrong, pay 2 win is kinda present but not really, 8/10 would launch a tank out of the map again"
13090,Good game
13091,"An interactive game, love it!"
13092,"Uneven match ups, tanks that never existed being allowed in to the game and repetitive maps that get boring fast. World of tanks used to be a good, entertaining game but then Blitz came out on Steam and too many people started to tweak stuff to supposedly make the game entertaining.Result......total lack of and loss of any reality and all it is now is a whole lot of people running around like mad folk shooting each other at random. No need for strategy either because the match ups see tanks that can be killed with one shot being pitted against tier 5 and 6 opponents!
There are plenty of other shoot em ups that people can play. How about bringing back some of the realism and increasing the maps to include tropical jungle etc. Also seriously consider firing the fools doing or programming your match ups and putting in people that have some idea!"
13093,best game ever
13094,"It's a good game. Fun to play casually and competitively (that's a lie, comp is trash)."
13095,Fun fast paced game
13096,"I'm afraid that it's another free to play game with micro-transactions element with the ""pay to win"" concept.

In later stage of the game it's possible to purchase triple the effective ammunition for gold (or a tremendious and impossible amount) of silver.

I shouldn't have expected anything else."
13097,i have no silver now i done this game gg.. i at viii lol
13098,Good casual game
13099,"what in gods name has gone wrong with this once great PC game.
seems like it has been pussyfied to be a mobile game ported to PC.
war gaming you guys have become a dissapointment.

R.I.P. great old world of tanks. we'll miss you."
13100,"Honestly, i'm not sure if I want to play this anymore. It's been taking too long from mostly
3 minutes or longer to get into a match and it's kinda boring just sitting here waiting. I might
go back to the original world of tanks because it doesn't take too long to get into one."
13101, it is by far one of the best games i have ever played
13102,"I have no idea how, but this game is more fun than original World of Tanks. I played this game for a little bit, but I had fun, alot of fun."
13103,oof
13104,just tanks
13105,Pretty good. The mobile version of world of tanks are for those with low specs computers.
13106,"It's quite good for free2play game
8.5/10"
13107,AWESOME TANK SIM !
13108,ME LIKE COLD WAR TANKS
13109,"Good game, I guess. I didnt saw any cheaters,so the anticheat is good.Community is quite toxic.But for that price(its free!)is really great game :)"
13110,Microtransactions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13111,Iwouldnt bother with this game anymore it is turning to crap! the ping is constantly bad even with my high speed connection and they are not concerned with the public when there is an issue with the game.I lost 2x24 certificates during mad games and they refused to replace them (not their policy ) there updates are often and inconvenient as they have no update mechanism nor do they have an update available notification system.they dont even put the version number on the download so you know not to keep downloading the old version.the pricing is getting rediculous and the quality is sliding rapidly.all in all this game is a waste of time.
13112,"this is a fucking moble game and sould stay that because war thunder is, without a doubt the far better game than this fucking game I've never liked a game with random chance as the main gameplay but no now I hate those tipe of games because of this and for those of you who think this is better than war thunder then how about you go play both and think again because not only does war thunder have what all the world of game and better but they also have better gameplay with the xray kill cam and with how you kill each other by eather killing the crew or taking out the amo and not that health bar shit because I fucking hate how unrealistic this game is and I used to play it on the 360 but now I've played war thunder and I cant play this ""game"" anymore"
13113,wank without arta
13114,"Great game, great graphics, decent players, some are salty but great game, enjoy!!!"
13115,"After Playing this game for 30 hours on steam and 100+ more on mobile , i think there still are some overpowered tanks and premiuims that wargaming is putting into the game , the k91 for example is a beast for tier 9 and could easily take on tier 10 tanks with ease. There are a lot of players with the flawless playerrating , which are just toxic and didnt even deserve their rating. Overall its a good game , but WG just has to handle their problems with OP premiums ( mainly about tier 8 and 9 premiums ) , and there has to be a way to see how much damage exactly you have blocked in the game , i am getting legendary steel walls with sidescrapes on chokepoints and i just want to see how much dmg i blocked.


-To all those toxic people with 5 stars perfect rating out there,  DONT BE TOXIC and try to tell them what they did wrong instead of saying ""(insert tankname here) noob""

-It has to be more difficult to reach the 5 star rating , because i see too many toxic people in those ratings."
13116,"World of Tanks Lite XD

Yes, i do recommend."
13125,i love this game its one of the few combat driving gams i can actually play and i really don't like this style of games normally but i was playing twisted metal awhile back on my old playstation system and thought lets try ? i found it to actually keep my attention for more than 15 minutes.
13126,wtd is this trash of game dont waste your time pliz
13127,World War II? Here it is! Well I kinda enjoy it but I get the lags because I didn't meet the requirements for the System... And why did I continue to download? BECAUSE WHY NOT(It's basically fun)
13128,"How halfed assed is this game? Can't use a wargaming account on steam, can't change the games resolution. Game won't allow anything but 60fps limit, because they appatently can't properly configure a game. 

Was this game made in China?"
13129,Good Game
13130,"Up until 5.5, i would play this game every day with friends. I whole heartedly enjoyed it, because it was in essence the same game as WoT PC and console just in earlier iterations. After 5.5? I don't even recognize the game. I have been playing since shortly after the game's release and have spent well over $1000 over the course of those years, and now WG sees it as OK and perfectly acceptable to destroy the game. Nearly ever tier 1-4 tank is gone, and they have a new cash grab in play: Collector tanks. They are tanks with premium coeficients for currency earning, yet WG reserves the right to nerf them. If you had bought a tank due to it being a very powerful tank, then find out WG will nerf it in due time would you still have bought it? I highly doubt it. Unlike the spare parts fiasco though, WG can't just retract this update. Something of this magnitude can not just be undone. If you still play the game thinking this update is perfectly fine and that this update will be taken back like spare parts, you are sadly mistaken. Wargaming has become cash hungry and have taken a once beautiful, allbeit toxic at times, game and brutally beaten it to death then taken it's wallet while they were at it.

Update: In the year that has gone by since this original comment, the game has only gotten worse. Wargaming has standardized the amount of experience points it requires to reach higher tiers, meaning before you have a real grasp of maps and how to play you have gone halfway up the research tree and are fighting players with far more experience. The game has become exponentially more toxic at least on the NA server, and stats seem to be all that matter. People will pick apart your stats down to the very tanks you play just for ammo to talk trash and put your down, and there has become an immense skill gap. The average player in this game wins about 46% of there matches, yet anything under a 56% winrate warrants trash talk and if you mostly play in tiers below 8 that only adds more fuel to the fire. I didn't think it was possible wargaming, but dear god you threw water on the grease fire instead of putting it out."
13131,"Great game, I played this for quite some time now (8 hours) and I used to play it on mobile a few years ago. It is really fun, and playing with your friends just make it more fun. I recommend this game. Another great attribute to this game is the fact that it is free. The research tree is really researched well, and realistic. 9/10"
13132,"Alright. I Absolutely LOVED this game. What more could you want? WoT on PC and Mobile that actually has a transferable account? HELL YEAH! One major complaint that me and almost all ""Old"" players who had grown to love the variety and fun this game was is that update 5.5 DESTROYED that. Tanks down-tiered, and tanks removed from the tech trees and turned into ""Collector's Tanks,"" not even premiums were safe. Admittedly, I liked the idea of having tanks that nobody else could get after 5.5, but it killed the variety and fun that early tier tanks were to play. And not even premiums were safe, as stated before. In total, I think that it's a complete bummer that the ""Collector's Tanks"" thing even exists, but for those who start after 5.5, they won't know any different, although I would say they are missing out on what once was a great game, and those who have watched this game evolve from before the British Heavy and Tank Destroyer lines were added, like me, will never forget what has happened here. For the record, this is worse than the spare parts shenanigans. In conclusion, I still think it is worth your time to play this game, but Update 5.5 was a complete dissapointment."
13133,kinda fun
13134,Nice game!!!

13140,"Basically ""Lite"" version of World of Tanks. Fewer tanks, smaller maps and team size, and no artys."
13141,"Sometimes it is hard and rather frustrating to play by yourself in this game, but, with friends, you can either cheer together or get salty together"
13142,"If you are new to the game, delete it immediately. It's gonna be better for you since every person who has at least half of his brain is gonna talk trash over you being braindead and clueless. You are gonna start hating the game and the whole team is gonna start hating you so DONT PLAY IT. For us, long time players is meh, kinda fun from time to time but also very frustrating from time to time. And its impossible to play during the events as the teams are more braindead and mentally disabled than ever. PS, the developer WG doesnt care about its playerbase at all so if u have lots of money you might as well enjoy this game, even if you are new to it but i can assure you that others will want to kill you if you are gonna be autistic and screw the whole game in your shiny new premium f****** tank. Cheers"
13143,Pretty fun.
13144,"I love this 7v7 battles more than 15v15, i have played full game for like 3 years and achieved alot in tournaments and i see that in this i could achieve even more.

Game is designed and built to make new users quit and nobody talks is interested in helping or cares about the game. Horrifically bad gameplay. Garbage Maps with no thinking whatsoever. 

There are some good points like it can be fun with the right equiment and a little help navigating the game. You can get some decent kills and it can be fun. Working on getting better tanks and equipment which should be some of the most fun in the game however is a nightmare. Honsetly it's like the people who designed the game had very little idea what they were doing."

13157,"This used to be the least pay to win tank game of all tank games. Easy to learn and play, really user-friendly. The tanks are a bit expensive but the grind is bearable. After update 5.5 though, greed has taken over and developers have decided to remove almost all of the low-tier tanks (ranks I-IV). Why? Because low tiers are much more enjoyable to play and easy to unlock and so people don't have to spend money like they do in high tiers. The company instead of trying to fix the high tiers and make the grind more bearable so that more people will play, instead decided to simply remove almost all the low tier tanks because they were losing money from players who found them more enjoyable. Not only that, but now if you want one of the low tier tanks that have been removed, you can wait and buy them (for real cash) as premium tanks.

Another great game destroyed by greed. I do not recommend you play this or any other title from Wargaming."
13158,very nice
13159,"Although I used to play this game very often, I stopped playing it because it had prevented my PC from running it since it was using the Integrated 630 Graphics from my PC. (and not my actual graphic's card) Even when I got it on Steam, it still takes hella long to load up and quite a while to load into a match. My internet is perfectly fine and so is my PC, I've checked countless times. Other than that, the game is very fun with many players willing to cover/support/block damage for you. The team work is amazing."

13166,Alright this game all i can say in my 5 years of playing WoT Blitz is like almost an better version of WoT itself from the OG pc version in my opinion but there pros and cons ik that but what makes this look fun and a bit easier is the credits you can credits very easy in here better then the OG pc version but grind to teir 10 is the same feeling as the OG pc version of the game (took me exactly 5 years to get the E100 in the pc version) and here im already teir 9 and im playing very well love the clans and everything but there is only one bad thing about the game and its that UPDATE 5.5 MESSED UP THE GRIND COMPLETELY for newer players now its just meh i highly recommand playing it but make sure you play fair and not be rude bc people are toxic in this game most of the time espacially at teir 9 and 10 otherwise enjoy the game :)
13167,good !!!
13168,A great game!!
13169,"The 5.5 update was terrible. It had to remove a lot, and a lot of tanks in the game and made a ridiculous joke called ""The Collector's Tank"". They moved up a lot of Premium tanks down to a collecter tank rank and other tanks that stayed wasn't even under the mercy anymore, even bringing them down tiers.

I understand if the intent was to ""balance"" the game, but this is too much; it downright destroyed this game. One of my biggest complaints was the collector tanks. I understand if this was a new tank type introduction thing, but demoting already Premiums (which people had worked hard, burnt their wallet and loved these tanks dearly) was just disregarded and made to a type of tank that is nowhere what the people paid Wargaming for! And I feel like this is just an excuse to just nerf former premiums.

Now, removal of tanks was a bit fair, but we loved a lot of tanks that they removed, and not to get whinny, it took out the enjoyment that was once in the game. Same goes with some tanks being brought down. This has technically robbed us of the love and money we used for the game. I'm sorry, but I'll have to uninstall it. There were better approaches to this."
13170,"Need alot of skill, if you have iyt, the game is fun"
13171,a
13172,"fast game, less toxic player"
13173,black friday sale is pretty nice
13174,"This is a good game and I enjoy it, but if you want to advance further than Tier 5 or Tier 6 you will probably have to spend some cash. 
The match making isn't always the best either, but you will be challenged in each match.
Also be prepared to be cussed out by Kids (or inmature Adults) on your team who die right away in a match and blame everyone but themselves. At least you can block the little turds in Chat.
Another thing that I hate is people buying a special ammo that just is way over powered.
The good Things about this game:
1. Graphics are decent.
2. Controls are simple.
3. You don't have to wait long for a match.
4. Matches take about 5 or 6 minutes or so at longest, so you can play a lot of matches in a short time.
5. You can rate player after a match (kinda). Praise or Negative choices.
6. You get free crates that give you things to help you upgrade your tanks or crew. Don't forget to open you Crates everyday!

Bad Things:
1. Hard to advance quickly or get a Tank you want unless you pay money for it.
2. Many A-Holes in this game. (Just ignore them)
3. Match making can be terrible most of the time.

I still recommend the game, but be prepared to hit a wall at Tier 5 or Tier 6 if you don't spend any money on the game.

13175,"""Best Game Ever!"""

13177,"Its a PAY TO WIN SHIT...u dnt believe me??? Create an account...play 3K battle in all tier and tanks...Create new account...then buy OP tanks with 100USD each and be a 60% er. FREE XP...CREDIT...PREMIUM AMMO...and the WG match making that always favor Pay to Win players.
N.B. and those who thinks I am a nub...i'm a 56% er without using any money. I could be a 65% er if I can use those Pay 2 win shits."
13178,good game
13179,"Not so good like pc version, but its playable"
13180,"Well, it's not perfect ,but it's fun if u love taks and have a friend to play with."
13181,"While F2P, it is not Pay-to-Win, and unlockable tanks are capable of taking out premiums if you know how to play well. Fun game overall, although I am not a fan of ficticous tanks that get added during events, as I much prefer historical models (even just prototypes)."
13182,damn game fam
13183,Really fun to play :)
13184,"Recommending for those who can't run WoT and want simpler game mechanics.

It's still P2P game like normal WoT because wargaming."

13219,"wtf, i really like this game, however i has never seen so many bugs and update glitches, first blacked out tanks, then lost my tanks and had to start over, however, recent updates seem to have cured most of the problems."

13226,"If you like 3rd person shooters you will love it.
A friend told me to download this game and try it out so I did, I had no regrets. The game had a fun tier system and is really fast paced, if you like those things you'll love it, but it doesn't just have that it has a fun matchmaking system."
13227,Now I can live out my dream of being in a competitive tankery anime.
13228,no
13229,Game is good but community is awful
13230,"I like the game, I just hate the new update removing alot of tanks which is actually nice but overall 8/10. I will still recommend this game because its cool."
13231,Very good can not find a better game than this.
13232,i wish they have the other verison of world of tanks on here
13233,"the 5.5 update makes Low Tier Sucks, like ""very bad"" nerfing the luchs makes my hearts broken. Low tier is no longer unique because of the NOOB FRIENDLY UPDATE, the Tanks are no longer serve their uniqueness, and also LT are not LT anymore they're slow their DPS are very low and their aiming time are slow as hell, don't expect this update as a balance update nor game fixing treat to the player, this update is a mess."
13234,"This game is great.  However, I do have some issues.  Right now I am rebooting my entire computer to see if it will help. The ""scoring"" when one gets a hit or gets hit seems to waver from red to green depending on when you enter the games.  The laws of chance dont give 7-0 , 6-0 5-0 or as many as 20 losses in a row to your side with the regularity this game does. There are times when the game seems right down the middle fair and it is great, then there are times when you seem to be shooting donuts and your armor is chinese fortune cookie shells. This seems to go in waves.  Im not sure if it has to do with location, type of computers in the game etc, but it can be extremely frustrating.  The only other complaint is that other players can tag you with penalties ie, ""inaction during battle"" which enough of them can get you booted off for an hour.  There is no way to defend yourself, and even when they tell me they have ways of checking, I still get bogus ""reports"", which ticks me off because Im usually the first guy killed because Im so darn aggressive.
In any case, the game, the tanks the idea and graphics of the game is remarkable and yes I would recommend it, although it does get expensive in the upper tiers. (hundreds of dollars if your nuts like me)."
13235,ITS VERY GOOD YES AND YOU SHOULD DOWNLOAD IT I DOWNLOADED IT YESTERDAY AND IM ALREADY AT MK IX
13236,"So basically this game became garbage tbh
I won't recommend anyone to play it cuz the developers will fuck your ass as hard as they can
They're gonna steal your money, your time, your fun and everything else
pls don't play this game"
13237,5.5 ruined the game. noth worth playing anymore. i quit this game and i recomend no one play it. if you want a fun game get warthunder.
13238,Nice one u guys totally fucked up the whole game at update 5.5
13239,"go play war thunder for realistic, this is arcade"
13240,"I really enjoy playing World of Tanks Blitz and being used to computer games it's really quite awesome that it's on steam :)
It's fun, exciting and very enjoyable (except when you have toxic players on your team). The graphics are good and most players are friendly and sociable. Overall I think it's really great, ok so some WarThunder players would probably dissagree but this is my opinion here. So all in all anyone who like tanks, video games, not having to deal with arty and action will definitely enjoy this game :)"
13241,Great game. Just a lot to learn for new players.
13242,"The devs---excuse my French--are GREEDY DIRTBAGS!
[let it grow, let it grow]

So, Update 5.5 Why why why why why?
WHY?

Youre money obseesed greedy little [beep]s who care nothing about your players, under the excuse of ""it's good for the noobs"". They got rid of most of the low tier tanks, so that people -Buy Garage slots  Also the noobs are going to get to the higher tiers faster because there are less tanks. They will feel destroyed because they are nubs in the high tier. S they buy gold. WE CN SEE THROUGH YOUR LIES, WARGAMING!

DO not buy AT ALL."
13243,this game makes me want to act on the advice of the black man with lightning
13244,Fcking low tier uselless
13245,"You may have some fun in this game, but it is mostly pointless. Skill barely matters here, since balance in the game predetermines wins and losses before the battle even starts.

More over, damage you deal per shot is RNG. Health based vehicle action games are never about skill and always about rng/tank upgrades. You always know how much time is left before you die (it is very boring to play like this). And it is not enjoyable nor rewarding. 

The game pretty much plays itself.

This game is a const grind. I remember playing this game in 2017 and earlier and i can tell you, rewards are even less than before. Let's say for simplicity, even if you win you get about 4k silver and 400 exp. If you lose -- on higher tiers you will LOSE money. Tank you want to buy costs 1kk and 50k exp. Do the math. It is insane how long you have to play to get something in this game. And it isn't even worth it.

Every issue the game has is only reinforced in higher tier battles, so do not grind while expecting better. It only becomes worse.

P2W content is not much of a problem compared to WOT, but it is annoying to see all these pop-ups on a screen.
I do think this game is better than WOT desktop, but you deserve better than this."
13246,I can't seem to get this thing to play anymore....so no until it works I can't recommend this game.  It just give me a fatal error screen and shutsdown.
13247,"gavno 
"
13248,"The most dumbest game I have played, doo not play this even if you are bored 0-10"
13249,:D
13250,"Good game and for a tank lover its fun driving your fav tanks, but unfortunatly the devs are not exactly smart when it comes to interacting with the player base. They dont care what you think or why and they most certainly dont care about your complaints, all they care about is money and this has been proven time and time again."
13251,10/10 would destroy tanks again
13252,"Fun Game. Grinding is a bit intense, but i guess it's worth it. SU-152 with troll gun. ISU-152 with an even more troll gun. Will make you laugh. Will make you curse the exisance of ur team. U can troll with really fast tanks. Bounce off shells with your tracks. You'll meet quite a few people that will curse you if you fail to carry their *sses. Overall quite fun. Thanks, Wargaming"
13253,"The game is remarkably simple and easy to get into and is extremely well implemented.  If this was designed and sold as a traditional game it would be one of the best I've played.  As it is free to try, I'd recommend everyone give it a go, but avoid becoming addicted and spending cash.

Sadly most of the potential is lost as the progression rate is set at about 2% of what you might expect of a game that is designed to be fun.  You can pay about £50 a year to get 'premium' progression rates that is about 10% of the speed you might like.  This game is designed from the ground up to strongly incentivise people to continually pay quite decent amounts of money for upgrades etc.  Many of the tanks require 100+ wins to progress to the next tank and there are hundreds of tanks to try.  Each time you upgrade you start with highly flawed tanks that you have to patiently play through dozens of games to unlock their 'upgrades' to make them practical, unless you pay extra cash of course."
13254,"Reccomended from someone who has played World of Tanks for years.

For fellow WoT players, here's what Blitz offers. 

1. 7v7 matches. Which play out faster, and an individual player can make a bigger difference.
2. +1/-1 matchmaking. No more Tier 8s vs 10s.
3. Mobile gaming. If you have a Wargaming account you can grind your tanks out on the move. As always I prefer to play any game on a Keyboard and mouse if I can, but having this option available is nice.
4. Every grind is less tedious. No more individual crew member grinds. Equipment is cheaper. Modules only need to be researched instead of researched and purchased.
5. Best perk of all. NO ARTILLERY!

Its graphics, music and variety of tanks are a downgrade, but all of the main lines are there. It's a fun pick up and go game with plenty of value in terms of gameplay hours considering it's Free to Play.

It's the streamlined, more casual friendly version of its big time PC cousin. If that suits your fancy then give it a shot."
13255,Same shit as pc version no balance p2w shitty mm
13256,The game is fun but the matchmaking times are ridiculous. I was waiting for almost 30 mins.
13257,"fun, challenging game.  Can be difficult to learn but there are a lot of official and unofficial youtube videos that help you learn the tips and strategies.  

Pay attention to the missions, special promotions , and the bonus containers and you can make a lot of progress"
13258,"i really enjoy this game. itsd a well designed game, and its easier then the original 9/10 100+ of fun time"
13259,"The game is good, but the servers suck, always have latency problems. 
How am i suppose to play with over 250 pings and the tanks just flying all around???WTF
Anyway, i am going to delete the game, so, BYE! I will never play it again"
13260,H
13261,"The game is ok at best, only a good way to kiil time for a short period. I'm a pretty decent player but I think the influx of premium tanks is rather annoying. I definitely wouldn't recommend spending money on the game."
13262,"Basically a simplified version of the original. Pretty pay-to-win, which is kind of disappointing. If you're looking for something easy, sure try it, otherwise just get the original. No use in continuing. Graphics are also pretty bland. Driving seemed a bit more smooth, but also slower (to compensate for much smaller maps). Overall its okay if you've never played the original or have no intention to.
Seemes strange that they'd put World of Warships and Blitz on steam but not World of Tanks."
13263,game is okay like 7/10 but with this comunnity who blame you because they died 1-st and did nothing and you died last and deal some heavy dmg its 3/10 in this example
13264,not working for fb login
13265,"this game is too hard 
"
13266,"EDIT OF PREVIOUS REVIEW
I have played more since my last review, and I have to say I think this is a good game, but it has major design flaws that prevent it from being a GREAT game.
PROS
1. Playing as historical tanks feels satisfying. If you love history, this is the game for you. For anybody else, tank combat is very fun in this game, which I will be covering next.
2. Combat and strategy. This game has very unique combat. Every game you enter, you must have a strategy in mind. It is rarely point and click once you get past tier 3. Combat is very diverse in this game, and 2 matches will RARELY feel exactly the same. An example of where strategy comes in mind, are tank destroyers. Tank destroyers sacrifice almost every other attribute for raw damage. Every time you use a tank destroyer, you must think if this shot will be worth it. A different example is with heavy tanks. Heavy tanks are easily able to deflect a lot of shells with ease, but they usually have a weak point. If you are going up against a heavy tank, you must learn it's weak points quickly.
CONS
This game is very pay2win. There are a few ""premium"" tanks that can easily wreck half a team, but that is the least of your worries.
It is the grind that you should think about.
In this game, there are ""boosters"" that can increase the amount of XP and credits you get. (Although you can earn them.) There is also the option for a premium account, which massively increases the amount of XP and credits you receive.
Although I understand that this is a free to play game and that the Wargaming needs to make their money somehow, it is not satisfying to have half of your rewards after each battle behind a paywall. The booster system almost makes it worse because you have to grind, in order to get the tools, to grind faster. (You have to grind in order to grind, is what I am saying.)
As much as I want to leave a favorable review, I am leaving a negative review as a warning. let the ""buyer"" beware.
However, it is a fun game if you are willing to spend some money into it, and if you are willing to withstand the grind."
13267,"2/10 wouldn't play again
"
13268,Some rude players but almost great game. Friday and Saturday is a no-no!
13269,"This game is an ARCADE Tank batle game. It's less serious than War Thunder but if you want to try something else, give this game a try."
13270,good game
13271,"This is a good online game, the most fun tank game and easy to play. If you play a competitive game and want a second game for time killing or relaxation or if your device has outdated graphic hardware and you want to play a good online game, this game is probably best suited for you.

Edit: Worked hard to get the KV-1 so that I can proceed towards the T-62. Then they suddenly changed the tech tree and all this was for nothing. Have to start all over again. Leaving this game for now until they fix things. Even if I start all over again they may change the tech tree again. This game needs stability and balance."

This game which I bought for 420,000 euros from my estonian kidney donor, a game which I though was a cure my gayness and feminist tendencies, took my left testicle and introduced me to all the bully hunters and flamanco riffs. Also my estonian kidney donor, did of a stroke while playng this game.My wife left me as I used her mothers credit union to fuel my constant adventures playing the m24-fucker-boi-that-killed-itself-while-driving. the m24-fucker-boi-that-killed-itself-while-driving analogy is a perfect example of how to live life after playing this game- to kill yourself, you pussy. My friend, a veitnamese aboriginal said and I quote, "" mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm fuuuuuck this game and thiese retatded fu kers that like to dikk fook them self mmmmmmmyeeeaeaehhh"". also from the bible-   Judges 4:21“But Jael, Heber’s wife, picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep, exhausted. She drove the peg through his temple into the ground, and he died.” But in this case, Heber is wargamings ear, and Jael is my peonis, slurging the negative comments in and out in and out.

13284,"3 tiers of harmless fun
Tier 4+ is pointless
Like most free2play but pay2win games this one has to bore you to death to make you pay to avoid the frustration.
Gold ammo pens without needing  to flank or aim.    Go mom's credit card!
Premium tanks break the matchmaking.                     Go mom's credit card!
You can't opt out of playing against made up halloween tanks     -      what a stupid crock
Tier 4 matched against tier 5, let's all pretend flanking or clever play makes a difference at all.  Stay away from them, don't intrude, hope you get a shot at an enemy tier 4 before your tier 5 teamates eat them all.
Or buy premium tanks and gold ammo.....                   Go mom's credit card!

I'm 55, my mom doesn't have a credit card, I flat out wouldn't pay for this under any circumstances, ever

Play it for a laugh once in a while, never bother above tier3, run around and have fun watching all your allies try to hide in the same bush, or ALL go right around the trainwreck and ram each other for a spot behind the last rock...

Otherwise it's a crock

13285,"I have never seen so many utter idiots in any other game as in this one. If you were complaining there are plenty of them in World of Tanks - here, in mobile version of the game - you will miss the PC game. The game is nice, but...after a few battles you will destroy your PC or have a heart attack. My favourite moment is when you have 6 ""team mates"" hiding in 1, the same bush, huged together...No. Just...NO! NO!!!"
13286,"the game is a scam, to get money out of your wallet, what a joke, hahaha no thankyou"

13288,i have personaly played this game over the years i have racked up hundreds of hours and played since update 3.2 this is one fun game.

13290,"Good casual fun, much better with friends. It's is free to play but the grind of free to play players is unreal. If you are willing to spend a bit money on it, you will have much more fun."
13291,play it
13292,"I loved this game, though I'm not very good at it. You command a tank, and you move and shoot with your team online, real time, against a team of enemies. It's quite a lot of fun."
13293,GOOD
13294,"the game is good but world of warship is way more fun and make you less angry prevating you from rage quit 
"
13295,The only game where you can score a critical hit on the enemies weak spot and still deal 0 damage. 11/10 would be matched only against people with higher power again.
13296,"These World of series are freaking great online games, just another win for team or single player games late at night."
13297,Its a free to play game that has everything to be a good game) Its matchmaking is balanced and the overall experience is good.
13298,wish i could refund all the time i spent on it
13299,"You're better off getting war thunder, don't be mislead by the promise of ""epic battles"", I can promise that you'll get into the lamest and most boring ""battles"" you could imagine coming from an action game. If you like simple no-skill aim and shoot styled games, this game is for you, you boring mf."
13300,I like the graphics and the tanks are realistic like how a sherman is easy to peirce.
13301,"This game...

I feel as if when I started playing way back, from the Windows Store, the game hadn't yet succumbed to the P2W meta. However, I feel like the game has been slowly slipping further and further from being fair for all, including F2P players. I have spent money on this game on quite a few occasions and, don't get me wrong, I know that it gives an advatage to people that do, what with Premium ammo, acc. time, tanks etc. I feel like this shouldn't be a thing, games that get this right only allow you to pay for cosmetics, stuff that looks nice but has no other purpose in-game. It's also becoming increasingly hard for new players to get a foothold in the game before being met with seal-clubbers in PzIIJ's and Ke-Ni Otsu's.

The gameplay is hard to fault (apart from the afore mentioned issues) and the map devs have done an overall good job in my opinion, making maps fair for all classes as much as possible. Obviously, Russian tenk OP, but the nations do seem to be evenly balanced and have little quirks that keep them interesting to play.

The game runs smoothly at max settings on a £200 laptop so the optimisation is there.
 
I can't really think of much else to write about so I'll wrap it up here and say that it's worth a try as it'll only cost you a download.

P.S. Don't be that person in a Lowe. Just don't."
13302,Игра для аутистов
13303,"Amazing game, I consider it a tank simulator for it's realism."
13304,i have play 2 hours. after i quit the game. i want to play back but it start a new game
13305,"DONT PICK SOVIET TANKS




pretty gud game tho 6/10"
13306,"Fun game to play with friends, simple controls, quick arcade gameplay, and fairly easy to run. potato on"
13307,pay to win
13308,"Just the facts:
It is FREE to play, but it is PAY to win.
If you understand that going in, you should have no problem having fun. 
You will understand that fully when YOUR bullets bounce off your enemies armor while HIS goes through yours.
Only because its free do I recommend it."
13309,A lot of energy and team work. love it
13310,"Is me, I have easily over 1000h in the WoT not blitz
Bad things:
-Pay2Win
-Teammates doing more harm to you than the enemies
-People shiettalking you when you do even a small mistake
-Staff doesnt give a slim fucc about you unless you're famous in da game
-People dont play it for fun, win is the most important thing in de whole game
-Even if you would like to buy something in the premium store HOLY DAMN the prices will make you homeless
-Unrealistic gameplay, (GAMEPLAY not graphics) artillery reach sometimes isnt even 1km
-Bad optimalization


Good things:
-emm
-yeah
-thats it


peace"
13311,"Meh not to great to be honest better on mobile 
"
13312,"I will start this out by saying this: To any new plaer, the game will be suffering, you have complex mechanics you have to learn to truly excel, but the game thankfully isnt outwardly Pay-To-Win, sure, the grind is insane, but you can learn to appreciate the vehicles you are grinding.

As an example, I used to DESPISE the Cruiser Tank A34 Comet 1, Tier 7 medium tank. its pretty pathetic at the outset, but gets better as you progress it, until it unleashes its full potential, BUT, only in its very specific playstyle, but this Distinguishes it. I hated the tank, now i have a small love for it, and seeing one makes me bubbly (especially when im shooting one, its made of buttermilk pancakes for armor)

Some Premiums fulfill unique niches, and are powerful in these specific niches, but in most cases, are pathetic in others, or merely average to mediocre.

New Player Experience sucks as does the economy for a new player, but those can be upgraded through updates (not saying either are acceptable) and the Stigmatization of the community went overboard, and still is blown out of proportion, which i don't think will ever go away.

Some days, I cannot stand this game, others, I adore it, Besides, being able to play it when you are away from it on your phone via wargaming.net ID is nice (my steam hours are low, but i was a Beta Tester on my iPad, and i use the same account, just for those wondering).

I would say try it, it's free, and only costs a little bit of your time after all."
13313,d
13314,"pay 2 win game

p2w games are never recommendable.

you can hide it behind ""pay to save time"" all you want. but it doesn't change the fact that you get in game advantages (damage,hp,modules,xp etc.) the moment you swipe your card.

theres also annoying notices in game to remind you to ""upgrade"" or ""purchase"" this and that constantly.

if you don't care about having skill or being disadvantaged, then play this game."
13315,"For those of you who complaint that u could not pen the enemies armor, you need to understand the game's physic first and its not just plain shooting at targets that is coming in your way. First of all there 3 types of armored vehicles in this game tank destroyer , heavy tanks and light tanks. Understand their roles first and know their weakness, before heading into a battle. Sometimes RNG may occur but there is nothing known as russian bias in this game. As an example a kv-2 could oneshot almost every tanks in its same tier, but it still lacks the reloading speed. Every  tanks has its pros and cons, it just depends on how you play it."
13316,"i Hate is game,  all the tanks are black and thats not very realisic.. Please someone help with this bug,bug fixed it alright and alot of research must've been done so this game has had some effort put into it"
13317,better than mobile version lol..
13318,Very fun strategic game difficult at later tiers but still fun
13319,"This is from davidecz of the WOTB forum.

Hi there,

i' m here to talk about the premium account.

No doubt, with a premium account even if you lost a battle, you got enough credit to still on the race to buy a new tank, no doubt there is no lost, and way more XP.

But my point here its to really compare closely the different in game with a premium account or not.

The last few week with some good friend we make several test, and we can tell that with a premium a count, your tank, any of your tank its way better in the battle field. Strong, powerful, not easy for the ennemy with no premium to take your down.

In the other hand with no premium account you are the weak of the game. Like i say with some friend we make several test, shooting each other.

At first, i got my premium account. I have a IS8 upgraded best gun, so my friend got the same. We was making the test shoting each other with the same aim. He cost 9 shots to him before he take my tank down ( he was not on premium account). He take for me 3 shots to take him down! HUGE difference! 

Then the next day it was my turn with no premium account, and this time my tank was down with 3 shots! And he cost me the same 9 to take him down ( he was on premium account.

I can understand that with a premium account you got more credit and more XP, but i really not agree with the difference in the battefield. Premium or not, we should have the same chance. This is not fair at all. I like the game, but not fair between premium account and no premium.

Premium or not, tank should be the same.

I'm prety sure that some people will answer my post saying that they are not agree, and everybody have right to say what they think, but first saying anything, please grab your friend, and make the test like we do and you'll see.

World of tanks its a good game, but should be fair with everyone and not only with who pay premium!"
13320,"Damn!!! BOOM!!!...
"
13321,"Game is very good untill you reach the later tiers, which will results in more expensive ammunitions and cosumables and as such your ""credits"" in-game currency will become lower as a result. Higher tier vehicles are more expensive to repair too. Racist remarks, trashtalks and blaming become rampant in higer tiers. I was called a ""Vietnam dog"" in a message sent by one of the player long after the battle is done because I was in a Vietnamese clan and apparently because I didn't win against superior number of players. 

Overall, the game is very enjoyable if you can ignore the hate messages and fight using lower tier to middle tier vehicles. You don't need to buy premium or golds to win, although they are helpful to grinning in-game currency and ""experience"" needed to upgrade to higher tiers vehicles."
13322,soo many premium tanks p2w game
13323,"if you spend any money on it ,like me :{ ,some how my account got wipedout ,i losted all my tanks and cash,
when i got to play it,had to stsrt all over noob again  losted all my  premium. hard to swallow ,"

-Free to Play
-Good gameplay
-Low spec - high specs
"
13349,"nice game , easy controle"
13350,"easyer to use on steam then mobie device, great game"
13351,"Lets see...
♦ Half the players play like bots

♦ No game mods, which would be a positive if the game wasn't sorely lacking in features (cant even rapid fire flak without spamming LMB, in the normal game you can hold lmb to repeat fire. Also no cruise control, etc.)

♦ Chat lasts for 1 second then dissappears permanantly. There is no way to view a log to see what other people said while you were shooting/getting shot at.

Don't waste your time on the 'convenience' of a steam world of tanks--it is vastly inferior to the original game."
13352,Very good free game you can really enjoy playing without putting money into it but if ur like me and want to have more fun i bought tanks and stuff dont have to do it but it helps them out so i would rate it like a 7/10 because its free.
13353,"Fun, easy, entertaining…"
13354,"The game starts out balanced, but once you get to tier 3, you start getting grouped with teir 4.
Then game becomes lop sided if you haven't PAID TO PLAY. 
you'll find your rounds don't pentrate and bounce off. 
and you get killed by 1 -2  hit kills.
And it becomes a grind and whoever has the better equipment, maxed perks, has the advantage - like a pyramid scheme. 
very little to do with skill, strategy, when your hits won't even penetrate from the rear. or when point blank to a track 
Very unbalanced game... but thats how WoT and WoW and War Thunder work."
13355,A reminder that this is the shitty arcade version of world of tanks. Go on the wargaming website to install the real game.
13356,"1.It's a World war 2 game Used tank best As I've been playing
(And it's so fun)
2.Play online with bonus Playing system It is reasonable.
3.Good game.
4.The net is not too crowded.

13357,"Recommended only for wallet warriors and credit card kids, if you're neither, you'll suffer like me. It can be both a decent and a super awful game depending on region what are you playing in. I'm mostly referring to European one, which is full of toxic players. About the game itself, it's playable, good time waster, bad textures, good amount of bugs, but still okay."
13358,"Better than the original WOT for 3 reasons: 
1. Easier to carry the game.
2. Less system requirements.
3. No arty all."

13365,Just get Warthunder.
13366,"Could do with better graphics while playing through steam, there is no atry tho ;)"
13367,"i have been playing this game for almost 2 years iirc, it's a good free to play game if you don't mind the grind or you can spend real money to buy premium tanks and advance tier.

the problem nowadays is that this game is filled with clueless players in high tier (IX-X) to be enjoyable anymore.
the grind to reach the high tier is no longer worth it as you will encounter worse match ups/players in tier IX/X compared to the lower tiers and most of the time you will have to carry the whole team to win the match.

it has been a good experience while it lasts, but WG has failed to provide a fun, balanced gameplay."
13368,"Can you please stop banning my communications?
like sure I chewed out a player but feedback should help. I would not recommend this gane to new people and snowflakes. The company is a bunch of liberal snowflakes, I had this game on mobile 4 years ago when everything was better.

I remember the following: 
-friendly fire for the noobs trying to steal kills on full HP
- tank destroyer friendly maps
-plus/minus 2 tier matchaking
- General chat where noobs can be noobs and stay out of battles

Edit: ok so, take out all chat bans and the player base is restored. Please for the love of god tell the company they are dying quicker than pokemon Go. This game was intended for people over 18, and oh boy. their feelings get hurt so easily they boast about reporting anyone like checkmate kid, I win by proving you suck and need to uninstall. War Thunder is more friendly to people who like to curse and apparently this game needs to be taken off Steam for sucking so bad and being censorship heavy. if you say ""plzzz"" it's censored."
13369,GOOD GAME
13370,Good
13371,Great game but should improve graphics and realism
13372,Lack of artillery is a great advantage of this version. I enjoy dynamic and quick battles. I think it's not so bad as many negative reviews state!
13373,cool
13374,"The gameplay is great and It's not just a P2W game, the real problem is [b] BOT players [/b] , they literally appear everytime you play. They everywhere!"
13375,"Better than WoT on PC. No artillery,7v7,teammates can be bad sometimes,but you can meet good people who are willing to teamwork. This has better matchmaking (+1/-1),And this game is not P2W since you actually need skill to play tanks.
Premium ammo has 20%less damage and is balanced that way,There are no P2W tanks since the driver actually needs to be good for the tank itself to be good. Wargaming just gave out everyone in an event coupons that reduce 50% of research from tier 6 to tier 10. I agree that a few tanks might be a bit too OP,like Helsing and Dracula. And there sometimes are those teammates that just die because they rushed head first,and called their team bad.  Overall this game is 8/10."
13376,XD
13377,Good game like playing it and fun blowing up other tanks and running down buildings
13378,"i like this game always keeps you thinking
"
13379,"its... okay? not really pay to win just has some pay to win apsects, decent graphics, decently fun, atleast the microtransactions are cheap.

13384,"If you like a completely Pay To Win weighted game with a really bad player base. This is it. Outragious prices for purchases in game and since it is supported on mobile devices you end up with bad teams match after match after match. Its so bad that when you get a good team and have a good match, you are actually suprised and excited even if it was a loss, just to have had a semi-balanced game."
13385,Sucks

13387,"for the true WOT PC experience download the real version not the mobile port go on google and download the launcher from the website but if you cant run it then stay with this i guess 

also wish there was a netural/inbetween but ill put a yes

also lower tiers there are bots unlike the true PC version because of the low player count"
13388,I had some issues with my account and I lost all my progress but after contacting the support team they fixed my issues and im back to where i was otherwise great game lots of fun Minus the extreme idiocy of a lot of your teammates. If your looking for a fun tank I recommend the KV2 on the Russian tech tree.

The graphics are fantastic in this game, even though i set the graphics to medium. There will of  course be some in game purchases when playing the game. I had so far played for 12 hours of the game and i had quite some fun with it. Overall a good game to get if you are into stradegy games."
13392,You will never not be playing Bots unless you spend money to teir up.

If you running on low performance computer and want to experience games like warthunder and WOT this is the one you seek for. One thing to notice is this game have a pay 2 win aspect so expect to lose matches from players who bought premium tanks and this is actually a skill team based game if you looking for a good gameplay i suggest play with a high winrate players and see videos of how the pros play. 8/10 *pay 2 win bullshid"

13405,good game
13406,gg
13407,"the game dashboard is very user friendly.  I like the user ability to select different tank types and test their abilities. the game play is by random groups.  there is a ability to chat between players.
  the random group playing is a good idea ""however"":  Many of the veteran players are very demeaning to new players.   Because there is a lot of derogatory comments it borders on bulling,  Because of these comments made by others during the game  it should be rate for adults or mature users."

13426,"PLEASE READ INFO BELOW!!!

STILL READ INFO BELOW BEFORE PLAYING!!!!!!!
I'll be rambling so PREPARE YOURSELF......

Yes I do recommend this game, but I think only certain people/players should get this game. AS IN there are some cons that I can think of, that you should know about, BEFORE getting this game. That some people may want to know before getting it. So for that reason, i'll start with the cons (there are some pros too, it's not all bad) But this is based 

OFF OF MY EXPERIENCE!!!!

CONS:
Grinding System that favors in-game purchases -
 I just want to start off with the grinding system. You'll only be able to progress in game decently fast, if you're a good/ok player. OR you spend REAL money on gold in game to PURCHASE Premium Account. And Premium Account increases  in game XP and currency (credits/silver) earned in game by 50%. And I wouldn't say it's expensive, but still. And it's expensive if you want to have Premium Account Every time you play. (FYI -  there will be a pro about this that does make it a little better)

Toxic Players - (there are still good, nice, HIGH WIN RATE % players)
Let me just say, it may have just been me. Maybe you'll experience it less or not as bad. IT HAS GOTTEN BETTER with the game trying to cut down and Poor sportsmanship So to speak. But it's still there, mean people, giving you sh!t. Usually it's against nuubs, new, or bad players, BUT HEY! It's also like even if you just lose that ONE battle, and theres a player that's a sore loser. And has a better win rate % than you. They give you sh!t and say you're a bad player. HELL!  Even if they're a worse player than you and their stats support it, they still give you sh!t.

Milking you for money -
It's seems that there is often another tank for you to buy WITH REAL MONEY, and they try to sell on the fact that it's a 
good tank. or boosters, and premium account, and cool camos or ATTACHMENTS, those recently come out. And don't get me wrong, the boosters, premium tanks and premium accounts DO HELP. But they do it for your money...

NOW it's time for the pros YEAH!!!

PROS:
Skill can matter in game - 
Even if you don't have premium tanks, or boosters, or premium account. You can still be an ok, good, or great player. But it will take time and effort, I like to think of it as- ""A tank, is only as good as the player driving it."" or in other words. You can be in a crappy tank, and KICK ANOTHER PLAYERS A*S that has a good, Over Powered/Premium tank. I know, i've done it, and i've have that happen to me  XD  

Play with friends in-game -
If you and a friend are playing, you can platoon and battle in a pair of 2. Any teir, any tank. BUT they can't have more that a  1 teir difference, EX: A tier 5 and a tier 7 CAN'T platoon together. But think about it, DAM it would be funny if a tier 1 and tier 10 could  XD hahahaha

LOTS of tanks and diversity to choose from -
Lights, heavies, Tank Destroyers, Mediums, French, British, American, German, among  others. And diversity to go with it. 
EX: Not all heavy tanks will have a ton or thick armor, Some tank destroyers are turretless, some tanks will require a special or different way to play them. some tanks will have different strengths and weaknesses, reguardless of what type or nation.

Regular Updates, and nerfs, and improvments -
Wargameing.net regularly updates and improves the game. Often fixing minor bugs, glitches, and making the game and tanks more balanced and far.

13429,"You may be able to play this game, but you must pay a lot of money if you want to have any chance of winning."
13430,After a year i reinstall and account system is changed. My account is assigned to EU (which has 200ms ping) for i don't know what reason and i can't transfer it. so i have to start fresh on closest server. so ridiculous
13431,the game is grindy but is fun to paly
13432,"Well. It may not seem like I have much hours in this game to write a good review. However I think my current expirence makes up for it. Anyway back on track.

This game is a good alternative for the actual World of Tanks, if you have a Low-end pc. Or the PC you stole from your babushka because she didn't need it. I enjoy playing this game. However, this game wants your money. And that will show the further you get into the tech trees. Currently I'm at Tier 8, I've bought multiple premiums. Including grinding for those premium event tanks. For instance, there is a Tier-VI Tiger, aka The Kuro Mori Mine. (I think that's what it's called) At the moment it is extremly rare to see. But it is a challenge for those new tier 5 tanks. But gets destroyed at tier 7 which I guess is a bit balanced? That a good enough example? No? well. How about the E-25. Possibly the best tank. As long as you know how to use it. The only balance about the tank is half the users of it rush in, and die quickly. Over all I DO reccomend this game for people who like tanks, espically those running on budget PCs. However. I do not reccomend it IF you've got a decent laptop. Like one with a 940MX, If you've got something like that then I reccomend the actual game. Which can be found by quickly searching up ""World of tanks"""
13433,This is a master peice that needs to be put up in a art Palace.
13434,"Sorry not a game for me. I like a more realistic game like Steel Beasts or War Thunder. I don't like the arcade stile gameplay, the graphics at least at the maps I played"
13435,If you want to experience using the tanks used in WW2 be my guest and have fun.
13436,Nice game
13437,"As a player of most F2P armor games (Tanki, AW, WOT, WARTHUNDER etc) I think I am more then experinced enough to write a review. 

So, is this game fun? Personally, I think yes, it's far more laid back and chill then WOT PC, and way, way less stressful then Warthunder, also, unlike armored warfare, it actually has a still alive playerbase (Getting into tier 1 to 3 games can still be a bit slow though, but this problem vanishes by tier 4.) Plus, it's more... Okay slightly a tiny bit more realistic then Tanki, as well as requireing more skill and stragtey. So if warthunder feels too intense and grindy, and WOT pc still just doesn't feel quite like the pick up and play chill game you are looking for, then get blitz, I mean, it's free, can't complain too much about something that's free after all. 

DISCLAIMER: This game is in no way a simulator, the physics are arcadey, drifting is easy to do, (Yes, you can drift a Panzer 4 H around a tiger, I've done it, and yes, it works quite well.) Ontop of the arcadey phsyics, plently of non historcial tanks are in the game such as the Warhammer tanks, and the two halloween tanks, And no, the GUP tanks do not count as being inaccurate, they are normal tanks, just with odd paintjobs. Speaking of paintjobs, expect to some blue, pink, and bright red tanks trundling about, as there are plently of creative camofluages available for PREMIUM currency. 
Yes, I did just say the word PREMIUM, No, this is not a pay to win game, I ain't spent a single cent on either this or WOT PC, and I've had plently of fun, done plently of stuff, and I don't feel like it's unfair to anyone who refuses to pay money. If you are finding yourself struggling against a premium tank that isn't helsing, I have two words, and I say them seriously. GIT GUD, No joke, premium tanks in this game are a laughable enemy, and if your skilled, and smart, you'll be able to easily counter them and send 'em smoking back to the garage. And remember the golden rule, if you see a tank you know you can't win against in a honorable one on one frontal fight, throw the honor in the trash bin and fight DIRTY, this is war after all. And before someone says, 'You only have 27 hours on this!' I got like, probs 2000 hours, 3000 hours combined across WOT PC and Warthunder, so I know what I'm doing. Most of the time. Okay, sometimes...


Also I said you can't complain about something free. Well screw that. Ahem, some problems I have with blitz, playing heavy tanks is a pain here, as the enemy will easily be able to see at a glance where they can and can't penetrate your armor, plus maps are small and tight, making it very likely you'll get flanked by a faster tank, and that often spells death for you. Ontop of that, as a heavy tank player, expect to go up against higher tiers, A LOT, when this happens, usually your HT becomes pretty much damn useless. Grinding high tiers can be quite a timesink, if you're going the free route, which I have. Matchmaking could use some work, is better then WOT pc or WT, but getting uptiered and facing vastly superiour tanks is common. Sealclubbing (When experienced players play low tiers and wreck the newcomers) is also a problem, expect to come up against people who know what they're doing and love doing it when you're in the low tiers. (For instance, I came here from a bunch of other tanking games, and I was able to utterly slaughter most people I came across, with only fellow seal clubbers giving me any problems.) And that's pretty much my problems, You'll problary find some pet peeves of your own at one point, but that's online gaming in general. 
TL:DR
If you like tanks, and like fast paced arcade action, while still being somewhat intrested in the history of tank warfare, give this a go, it's free, easy to play, and I have, and am still having, a 'blast' of a fun time.

So, if ya decided to join our community, welcome recruit (Or sealclubber from warthunder. And if you are that, shame on you. Shame on you. Stop bullying smol underage tonks.) Ahem, as I was saying, welcome, and, PANZER VOR!"
13438,"[Perspective]
I really love this game and I really mean it. I have been playing very often since 2014 - the game was still at the mobile port. But these recent games - for the past months, have been a big dissapointment for me that I can't even enjoy playing anymore. Instead of having a fun experience, you'll end up getting stressed almost all of the time because of the mindset of fighting the entirety of the enemy team just to win. You are a one man army yourself, around 70% of the time atleast.

[Ethics]
I may have complained about my teammate's gameplay before but not these recent years the very least. I may have left around 8-10 games total due to my internet connection problems but not with my consent to do so. I have respected my team and the enemy team for every single battle. It's okay to play badly, as I have played bad games too myself. I can see players that are just starting from the game making their way on playing better as a player. But in the end this is what I get? Massive amounts of lost battles due to Inactive and active (which is painful, I prefer inactive players) players each of them dealing 0 damage for almost 13 games straight in high tier battles (literally in tier VIII and up) for the past 2 months? Where is the fairness in that? Both my Dad and brother experienced these issues and can't even play 5 games straight without frustration.

[Credit System] 
Regarding the credit system though, I don't really think that this is a Pay 2 win game, as you can make profit just by playing really good and stragetically, in dealing enough damage around 150%+ your own tank's hit points. Or just play at mid tiers like tier VI for easy credit making.

[Compensation]
I kind of feel that the missions for premium tanks, events and the bonus containers are just there as a compensation for your losses, which kind of make you still play this game. The game is trying really hard to make you still hooked in the game despite of all the mess in battles.

[Appreciation]
I really wish there was a neutral button on rating because I really loved this game, why it is so painful.
I'll probably still play it though, but not that often. Your mood is always at stake in every battle.
Thanks for the good old times. -Lraxious"
13439,I sold my ak to spend money on this game and it wasnt worth it
13440,"Круто когда снярады летят своей жизнью, круто когда ты с топ танка стреляешь любой стартовый и не пробиваешь

13441,very pay to win.
13442,"Was bored through the entire forced tutorial, only to be matched with only people with the exact same tier tank as mine, which means progression means nothing, your competition will always be just as strong. Did not enjoy any of the 1 hour 52 minutes of playing this.

The original world of tanks is a lot better."
13443,"Gacha gw ampas asw >:'v

RNG GOD PLZ BLESS ME!! >:v"
13444,i play this version because no ghey arty :^)
13445,"By all means it's not a bad game, and there are plenty of tanks to choose form. However gameplay is a bit lackluster and feels like more like a mobile game. Things can get dull, so its better off geting a similar game on your tablet."
13446,"Got through the tutorial and the controls are soooooo bad I had to get rid of it
Idk what purpose this game really even serves here just play World of Tanks"
13447,"You can try this one out, but be warned: This game is addictive and straight out COOL! The issue is that it takes real money to get into the levels beyond the ""NOOB"" stage without many days of low-level games. Use cash to get trained and to get credits for training for the ""crew"" of the tank or buy a premium tank. Collecting tanks and adding stuff to them in the ""Garage"" is an interesting part of the game. Premium upgrades, vehicles, and garage slots can be purchased, but I prefer to earn credits by waiting for FREE containers and winning games. But, if the player is OK with repeated thrashings and has a little patience, much fun can be had without massive graphic bloodshed."
13448,"Great  tank battles...and it's not over,till it's over!"
13449,"In my times of playing the game, I've found that it is fun and the grinding is hard, its enjoyable but the way it seems pay to win can be very aggrivating, they give out these bundle deals with tanks that are maxed out with the modules without a care where as the other people do it the hard way without shelling out $24-$65 dollars on tanks and perks. Gold is hard to come by without buying it as well if you don't participate in a tourney either. but besides that it is a great game."
13450,"World of Tanks is just a fun paid to win phone game.
Mediocre graphics.
Monetization everywhere.
Two to four minute queue times.

It's fun in the begining, but dammn do you get greedy"
13451,I can't make in app purchases for some reason just take my money.
13452,v5.5
13453,I have a better chance of winning a hand in poker than actually getting something decent from this game.
13454,"Challenging but not too challenging, always a different experience because they are real players and not just PC controled."
13455,"its free, try it if you feel like it."
13456,throw money at game and get bugger all in return™ simulator
13457,"I think the foundation of the game and some of the complexity looked good.  The only reason for my negative review is that I wanted to exprience all the classes to get an idea of what I'd like to focus towards in the game.  After playing 6-7 games I realized it would be hours of grinding before I could have the opperunity to ""try"" another class.  A few weeks just to try them out and see what I want to work towards. 

I don't mind grindy games but i'm not going to spend a few weeks of my time to see how I shoudl get started, least let us try them out first.   I could love it or hate it, no idea the tools aren't there to see without grind."
13458,"I love the Graphics, Tanks, customizable tanks, and a lot of stuff... Including the Soviet tanks. Those tanks are OUR favorites.

And that you can yell URAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"

13460,Tip-top game
13461,"If you can't play original World of Tanks PC this is next best option.
If you have World of Tanks Blitz mobile account, you can connect mobile and steam account in [url=wargaming.net]wargaming.net[/url] and have benefit from mouse and keyboard and still playing with other mobile player."
13462,A lighter version of World of Tanks and a lot more simple. It's very fun to play and the tanks look amazing :)
13463,"P2W as a bonus element.
Good game overall if you don't mind matchmaking fucking you over and over again."
13464,"i like this game its fun and it works for players who cant run the actal world of tanks, i also like that i dont need to buy modules, so i can have up to the millions of credits, well enough to buy 4 rounds or premium ammo i have in all tanks that can have it, and to buy all 3 slots of camo, povisions and consumables. so people saying its pay to win are incorrect"
13465,Spent most of my time spectating my friend who demolishes the enemy while I instantly die at the start. Highly recommend!
13466,"World of greed, developers couldt care less about players.
Give them money.
Thats it.
Go do gambling or slot machines, is way funnier than this shit.

2022 update: I threw in the trash can 3k hours, dont do it, avoid it like plague, this game is not worth it, its only getting worse and worse and worse.

Matchmaking is horrible, no beyond horrible, balance is trash, everything is bad, avoid."
13467,just play warthunder lol
13468,"So, I nosed into my WoT B install again today and to my dismay, I discovered that there really is no artillery.
A quick search revealed the reason and... I get it. I'm not happy with it but I do get it. Sadly, this probably means no WoT B for me, as I preferred playing artillery."
13469,its verys fun i have it on my phone its also good for people whos computer cant handle the other version
13470,"Hella better than real WoT in terms of matchmaking,game duration,action etc."
13471,i cant remeber
13472,FUCK THIS GAME! Have nothing to do with the actuall WoT. Some bullcrap mobile port or something.
13473,Pay to proggres.Good game if you are not salty.
13474,Wtf is wrong wiht your loading screens took me 3 mins to finally play a dam game and half of the time either i am ded or half health fix it you monehy hungry son of bitches!!
13475,so before i got this game i asked myself why world of tanks added blitz on the end so i looked in the reviews and saw more or less what i expected P2W and a bunch of other stuff but the pay to win aspect was curious i didnt remember world of tanks being that bad last i played though that was while ago so i got it and saw the difference after a couple hours at first i just thought is was a series of massive update but uh turns out to be a mobile port more or less so i dug around to find the original and quickly grew disinterested playing war thunder now
13476,Nice
13477,I played for a little bit. Probably not going to play it for more than 6 hours....
13478,This game is so dumb
13479,Gay
13480,Tanks with life bars?Really?Go play War Thunder scrubs!!
13481,"1.Sheeps Everywhere.

3.THIS GAME IS P2W

13482,"The mouse sensitivity is horrible, it skips and is either too slow or too fast
the UI is horrible on pc

This is a game that should have never stuck its shitty head into the realm of PC gaming, keep this game on mobile wargaming, we dont want blitz on the pc scene, thats what WOT and WOWS is for."
13483,nope
13484,"Fast passed action. No two games are the same with four categories of vehicles, each with dozens of models help keep the  game from being redundant. The basic controls are easy to learn and use but take time to master."
13485,Just play the original World of Tanks and not this shit ! TERRIBLE graphics and shitty gameplay . If you want a better comparison just compare CS 1.6 visuals with Battlefield 1's visual ! that's the difference you'll get. You want to play WoT ? just go to wargaming website and download it's launcher that EZ.
13486,"Great game. Been playing this since 2015 and I have no regrets. Everything is great until T6. Then you get people spamming heat at spaced armor, heavies camping in spawns and Grille on the front line. Play it if you hate your sanity and dont mind throwing cash at devs just so you can hit that magical 60%. Happy tanking!"
13487,"The game has a 120hz option but nobody seems to be able to use it? I tried to set my monitor to 120hz down from 144hz to see if anything changes, nothing did, 60 fps is unplayable."
13488,"Veri good game, get it. Though all the non-realistic tanks kinda of ruin it. Though it is a brilliant game"
13489,I enjoy this game alot but it get's very annoying when a tank disapears right in front of you makeing you miss a shot.That is one thing I think should be fixed but otherwise great game.
13490,"Well it has it Pros and Cons 
Pros
- Its Fun
Cons
-It is very Pay 2 Win 
-Im not kidding poeple with money will have bullshit advantages 
-after i got rid of my pototae pc and got a gaming pc i stopped playing

i played for a couple of hours"
13491,"Matchmaking is so broken that even Bob the builder cant fix it. No need to aim because shells still go where the shells wants to. The comunity is toxic that it has to be censored like hentai is anime.

183/10 prety good!"
13492,"First and foremost, this game is [b]not[/b] pay to win. Don't mind what all of the other comments about this game are saying. 
Premium tanks are different from the standard tech tree tanks because they can be bought with money and anyone with a brain larger than a golf ball can tell you that they all aren't better than tech tree tanks.

Yes, a few tanks are op in some instances and others but eventually balances come to them. There are op tech tanks too. In a game with hundreds of various tanks you can play as there will always be some tanks that are better than others. It's impossible to completely and properly balance all of them. There has also recently been new premium tanks that have been added that are below average. 

[b]There isn't a tank that you can buy that will make you great and win every battle.[/b]

Also premium ammo. Your tank doesn't have enough penetration to go through another? Buy some premium ammo. You might be able to pen it now but at the cost of doing less damage. Yeah, that might negate some of the effect of having large amounts of armor but its a trade off to make it not op. Be glad that the damage nerf for premium ammo came.

Many others complain that they get into a game with all tanks that are of higher tier than them and they can't do anything but yet again that's wrong. There is always a way that you can contribute to the battle. If you're a small fast tank with low penetration wait until the heavies start fighting it out and whip around behind them. Maybe even assassinate a tank destroyer. Use your head people, it's not that hard.

Yes, this game is worth it. Try it out for a bit. Of course its a grindy type game but you're getting all of this for free so be grateful. Get past tier 5 atleast. Thats when the tanks really start to show their differences. Light tanks become really fast and maneuverable, medium tanks become quicker brawlers with nice guns, heavies become huge shields with lots of armor, and tank destroyers start having larger and larger guns.

I like the game it's quite nice,

-it´s so annoying losing like 50battles in row it makes u bored so much this game is (until u are losing battles and missing shots then it gets ) great and i really enjoyed it but it wants your vallet to be empty (how unexpected for wg and free game xD)
-it isn´t a game for impatient people and those who have problems with anger
*recommending this game depends on mood after a few battles*"
13501,"p2w but a decent game overall, you can beat wallet warriors by simply playing smart ex ; bush camping an is 5 with your crappy amx 13 75 which has barely any pen"

-tanks
-potato computer friendly

cons:
-fake t0nks

-an abundance of bad players tbh

just don't buy stuff from them please"

if u play this, try a tournament, which is free and it'll be ur chance to advance to the PRO level
"
13504,"The game is fun, but requires lots of skill to play.
Way more balanced than the normal World of Tanks.
People complaining about playing against higher tier tanks are just noobs.
If you wanna have fun, stay at low tier until you learn,"
13505,"yeet iam noob
"
13506,im gonna play this game now because world of tanks (the original) wont let me in so i will play this any time
13507,"Want a good game with historically accurate tanks and match making that makes sense. Then World of Tanks Blitz is definitely not for you, but if you actually want a decent game get the original WoT; not this dog shit that will make you regret living your life just so you can run it a 60fps unlike other games you run on 30fps."
13508,"This game is a fairly decent armored combat game, but by no means competes with the full PC version, and the full PC version does not compete with warthunder. The only advantages that blitz has over anything is it's mobile port (which I play all the time) and it's ability to be run on a potato."
13509,It is a pay to win game Uneven match making putting tanks that have no uses on teams that cant hurt the other side where machine guns kill you faster than and 7.5 cm shell.it is a money sink cant sell you old tanks trying to force to too buy new slots .
13510,"After 1500+ hours i put into this game (started playing on a phone first then moved to steam , that's why i have 1.136 here) i decided to unstall this game for good. It was a long ride since i started playing back in 2014.

The main thing i knew i'll feel when starting up this game on my pc was 'rage' , 'anger' etc. But for some reason i kept playing. Call it ''i wanted to get another tank'' reason or something. 

This game has been improved over the years in terms of grinding , free boosters came in , free activatable premium account etc.

But the main issue never got fixed. Hordes and hordes of braindead players , afk's on purpose , and the kinds of low lifes you can find in online gaming to the fullest. One of the most toxic community i have ever encountered.

What was the Wargamings solution to all this over the years? A simple complaint system were you can ''report'' other players after the games and 'if' confirmed the report will be showed up into the player profile. (Needless to say that the confirmation system is absolutelly broken and many actual reports never count.)

What did this report system actually did? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I have looked to countless players profiles with more than 300-400 confirmed complaints about them being afk or for unsportive conduct. (Imagine how many uncofirmed reports thoose players have on their account) THOOSE players still played like nothing happened.

I even have used the ticket system to WRITE a report about thoose players and Wargaming did nothing for thoose cases.

AND if all thoose things i have written above weren't enough , Wargaming keeps roling out completely broken premium tanks that dominate like there's no tommorow. Over the years this phenomenon only kept getting worse and worse and the game turned into a pay to win system.

Over the years i saw countless comments on their facebook page from people reporting these issues and WG kept doing absolutely nothing and even into some cases doing more bad than good with the updates.

I'm more than happy for more than a month now that i unstalled this crap forever. 

If you are a player right now do a favor to yourself and get away from the cancer named WOT BLITZ. If you are thinking about installing this rage generator of a game for the first time just press the ignore button and enjoy your cancer free life."
13511,this game pretty fun and chill not to bad
13512,Stupid not realistic doesnt work dumb stupid hate it
13513,more player like a bot
13514,like it
13515,"Decent, i have nearly 10k battles in WOT blitz, and i do recommennd it if you like tank warfare.

PROS:
+ alot of tanks to choose
+ games dont take that long (max 7min)
+ tanks!
+ overall a WAY better game compared to wot-pc

CONS:
- graphics are $h!t compared to the pc version
- fv215b 183
- very grindy if you're trying to get a tier 8+
- Wot spamms you with things they sell in game to get your money, most events can only be
completed if you spend real cash.

I like the game because i have been playing it for a really ling while, and with all the versions (mobile, mobile beta, pc, pc beta) i have played over 2000 hours of wot and i still enjoy playin it with friends."
13516,very good game and fun
13517,Really good. Smooth play and easy to learn xp and upgrade system. :)
13518,greatest game in the world would reccomend 11/10
13519,Игра крутая
13520,This game at lower levels is great... once you start moving up the tiers its P2W... Most matches are full of premium tanks and ammo to follow so if you dont mind staying at a low level then its not to bad
13521,well lag switching is on the rise the game has and will allways have a hard slant on pay to will..... give up on tactics you will be ridiculed for wanting things like scouts or snipers in your stratagies because most of the players have them mental development of an addled 6 year old and think light tanks should hide behind the heaveies and never be usefull
13522,Really Great!!! 9/10
13523,"Fun game, good break from regular world of tanks, a bit easier as well but of course not as deep in terms of tech trees and mechanics. Overall would recommend, and also its free!"
13524,My PC can't handle the regular WoT. So Blitz is the WoT for a low budget PC like me.
13525,not bad games
13526,"I love the game I'm just not good at it LMAO, and I'm to poor to afford shit."
13527,WOTB IS AMAZING SCREW ALL THE HATERS
13528,"I used to have a review that spoke positively of WOT:Blitz but over the past year there has been a lot of bad things happening to the game. In a nutshell: two tanks called the annihilator and smasher, designed for a post-apocalyptic themed event, are blatantly overpowered and received from lootboxes that cost irl $ to get. (5-10$ a pop usually with 4% chance to get the tanks i think? idk prices change too)

i don't mind if a tank you can buy is slightly overpowered, people whine a lot about balance and believe me there are a lot of overpowered premium tanks, but the anni and smasher put everything else they fight against to shame in almost every way. things became pay to win and have been for long enough that, despite really enjoying my time here in the past, i often turn to other games instead of tanks now.

saw my old review was positive, but can't recommend trying/playing the game anymore in good conscious."
13529,Dont play this
13530,its good but...                   WERE IS THE MARK 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13531,"graphics are great, play is fast paced."
13532,I have 994 hours in this game and ive played for a year and a half still not tired of it.
13533,fun to burn some time if you have some
13534,"Классная игра, занимает много время."
13535,"Been playing since 2015 [mobile device then] with over 13 K battles. Still is a good game.

Simple to learn, hard to truely master. Balancing? Some would complain, yet War is never fair. Gameplay is enjoyable to an extent with multiple maps and tanks. Grinding could take time however, events could be dislikeable to some. A number of toxic players now and then and pricy tanks. Most battles are different. Sadly, depending on the person, sometimes it's frustrating like RNG. Not much else to complain. Blitz is a fast paced game.

When it first came out in 2014, originally was mobile. Take note however, this could be outshined by the PC and Console versions in graphics, game, content, and that sort of stuff, so you could have that, if your PC can handle, it's less demanding. For a mobile game it good enough, not entirely perfect, but not too far from it.

From a certain point of view."
13536,"Nice game, but the premium tanks they come up with are SO INSANELY EXPENSIVE! (like 30 to 100 euro per piece) Too stupid"
13537,"Its a money pit of a game. Not very enjoyable unless you are fortunate enough to run with a good team by your side. Most the battles youre on your own, as team members hold back. Tank effectiveness is determined by how much gold (money) you put into it. Ive since quit playing the game as it is very pay to win."
13538,"I wasted too many hours on this piece of work, I don't want you to."
13539,do you like unbalanced tank types then look no further.
13540,"Do you love zagoniatь your stvol in angar to other tankist?


You are tankist now."
13541,"Having 835(842) hours of gameplays (Didn't count android ver.) and i'll be honest it pretty fun tanks game. Had a lot of fun playing with my friends and clan members but now it really bad, This game keep adding ridiculous stuffs mostly premium tanks, loads of events grinding for things, bad community and matchmaking are the worst, will never play this again. 4/10 that is all."
13542,"i do recommend it, however...

I think that you'd have a much better experience just playing WoT instead of Blitz. The graphics are much better."
13543,good game!
13544,gucci
13545,"This game has an extremely toxic and horrid community.  Do not play this game if you want teamwork, communication, or friendliness.  Expect to carry the game, or get screamed at by teammates who died in the first minute.

The next massive problem is the premium tank system.  There is no minimum threshold a player has to hit before they can buy a high-tier premium tank.  You will find the majority of high-tier premium tank players have less than 1k battles while fighting with tier eight premium tanks.  They won't know where weak spots are, how side scraping and basic angling works, a fundamental understanding of the maps, and how to cooperate with teammates effectively.  When these players don't get their way, expect them to block teammates' shots, drown themselves, run to the enemy team, and yell at teammates. You'll frequently get these players as teammates.

The low tier games have worse issues.  As a new player, you'll continuously match up with seal-clubbers.  Expect to play every game against players with 20k battles, maxed out equipment, crew, and premium ammo.

Both the low tier and high tier have the same problem with unbalanced matchmaking. Expect always to have the team full of 1k premium tank players and sub-45%ers, while the other is full of 60%ers.  Never rely on your team or expect them to help you; always play games like a 1v7.

XP and credit grind is also a significant problem.  Expect to play tanks with stock guns, turrets, and engines that take 100's of games to upgrade and reach its full potential fully. Prepare to suffer as your tank cannot do anything while also dealing with garbage teammates.

Save yourself and your sanity.  Play something that you enjoy.  2/10."
13546,"Its a good game the servers are bit lagy, sadly theres no artillery tanks, you dont have to get packages to upgrade your tanks like on console and pc versons, other than that its a good game"
13547,It's ok
13548,"I really enjoyed playing this game and have created a profile on World of Tanks.com and 
can't wait to play the first game"

13552,"This is a good game for a beginner, and that is what I am.
"
13553,"My friend introduced this to me and tbh i had doubts at first, but the more and more you start playing it the better it gets."
13554,This particular game is different from his brother World of Tanks. Although the mechanics are still the same and also the map is smaller like 500m max. Max team members here is seven and no artillery type tanks so strategy here would be easier to be applied.
13555,didnt like
13556,"This game is build on money, money gives you more power and thats also quite bad. Specially if you look at the prices of the bundles."
13557,"I started playing this on my phone over 3 years before it was on steam.  probably in 800h range of play.

Love it!

The matches are 7 vs 7 on small maps which is really good so its quick and lots of action."
13558," If you are looking for militaristic games, this piece of junk is not what you expect. Go for Warthunder instead.
 If you are looking for childish rocket launcher games, and willingly to be milked dry by greedy devs, and enjoy unbalanced P2W gameplay, no communication and socialize because of ""friend-only-message"" feature, then, me myself, a 4 years veteran of this game's mobile platform, recommend this for you.
 You won't see me in this game anyway. Uninstalled."
13559,"this game is so fun but there is some issus needs to be fixed for exambel when you write in the end of the game like in last 
second the game will crash but thats  small issus and i hope it gets fixed now the second issus i dont know if its just me 
but there is no button for the abilitiy when you have the (camoflagnet)  i dont know what button to press so i can use it 
and thats about it but any thing ealse is good graphics game play everything is great and i took the time to write the review
becasue i like it
and yeah keep it up"
13560,"A game that i can play on pc and mobile no tie downs and its fun both syles im so down for this!!!!!!!
been playing this now for a good bit and i got to say play it and give ita go its for your pc and your phones and it works 7 v 7 is awesome fast games not too grindy but you will work for the good tanks i will recommend this game to all who love world of tanks and want to have portable ver. of the game to play on the go that can still play on pc!!!!"
13561,terrible teams
13562,exellent game but need  the game play one on one would be good
13563,"
I hope,  world of tank, not blitz, is added to steam too"
13564,If your PC (in my case Laptop) has a Intel HD graphics and your RAM is 4GB just play this fuken game
13565,"It's fun, competitive, and a constantly evolving game. Not at all pay to win though there are some in app purchases available. 
1 issue is the toxic playerbase, but there are settings available to minimize that if you so desire.
Love the game won't stop playing it until they shut the servers down."
13566,"if you're on steam, you have a computer, if you have a computer and want tanks get world of tanks, or war thunder, this game is nothing but a waste of time with cash sluts as its developers"
13567,Fun game. Satisfiying
13568,"Nice budget version. If you don't have the money or don`t want to spend your money, try Blitz."
13569,fucking wargaming.....fix the server blyat....!!!1
13570,"World of Tanks is good game but we need a english server,"
13571,"This is a very awesome game to play. You get to see what real World War two tanks and around that era, how they worked, what they looked like, and even better, how they preformed. I will say unless you plan to buy everything (I recommend you don't as it gets very pricy), your going to want a lot of time to spend in this game to get things. Ive played several hours in it, I still love the game."
13572,horrible game know tons of people lost all there exp and ranks btw so if you liked it before youll surley hate it know!
13573,"This game really is hard to love, its a meh game"
13574,Nice

I prefer W*r Th*nd*r but this good tho

7/10"
13581,"love the game
"
13582,Very noice tank game for people that cant play real World of Tanks.
13583,I wish I didn't invest so much time into this game.  It's become one of the worst gaming experiences I've ever had.  The fun of having tank battles is overshadowed by the amount of terrible players and bots that ruin practically every match.
13584,Still good game and please balance the premium tank with not premium
13585,"Playing this game since 2015, this game has a quick pace gameplay with average 4-5 minutes/battle. I enjoyed it alot, though you have to rest a while when you have lose streak. Many clowns with thick wallets play this game after all, espiacially on tier VIII. You just can't help it."
13586,"i really really enjoy this game but alot of player are way to salty. but heey if you dont care go play it;p
"
13587,go tank mode
13588,Good
13589,Love the gane.
13590,"Casually played; Entertaining... When in tier IX-X; NOT WORTH THE EFFORD!!!!!!!!!! Played until I reached tier X on nearly all tanks, never paid a dime - and glad I didn't - and realized that there was too much variety of skills in any given match to keep this entertaining for me, so I simply deleted this. Also them snowflakes have contaminated this game. Only playable if you have a FULL CLAN with working communications. Can't say this is pay to win, but you'll need some premium tanks and daily doubles to keep your credits flowing inwards when tier VIII or higher."
13591,"This game takes a long time to tier up in after you reach tier 7. I've played over 175 hours and I haven't even gotten a tier 9 - but this isn't saying it's a bad game.

It's fun, especially if you find the right tank for you and are up for the grind to tanks you want to play. You definitely shouldn't rush to tier 10, as this will probably ruin the experience for you.

You don't need to spend money on this game, and often they events where you can earn tanks and other things like boosters and gold for just playing the game for free."
13592,"Игра найс
но есть проблемы по типу не исторических танков и камуфляжей 
залупусы виндетторы хелсенг дракула что это за херь"
13593,it good for players who wants to play WoT but with a potato pc
13594,WOTB is fun and flexible.  Sometimes frustrating but any game worth playing will be.  The flex is due to the diff tanks and upgrades.  The fun is when You get a good team that works together.  CONS  historically tanks had smoke ejectors or smoke rds - which are  A NECCESARY DEFENSIVE TOOL.
13595,mewmew
13596,"This version isn't bad, but this was made for mobile devices mainly.  The PC and the console versions are much better. But if you want to battle on the go, it's good for that.  Fast 7 vs. 7 battles versus the larger 15 vs. 15 battles the main verisons.  Don't expect your progress to sync with the main versions, as this will be a totally separate account.  I would recommend this game."
13597,Full of P2W tanks and Matchmaker is bad
13598,remove heishing ho
13599,played the orignal world of tanks and the tutorial system is very very frustrating there should be a way to cancel it very very anoying
13600,I prefer the (PC) original.
13601,top top top top top top top top top top top top top top loloollool I LOVE THIS GAME :D:D:D:D:DD:D:D:D:D:D :3 plz add Italiano tanks :DDD
13602,Оттличный заменитель World of Tanks для ПК))))
13603,"Shitty teammates, shitty company, money laundering scam. Get reported for a bad battle, plus harassment weekly from toxic players."
13604,It's a great time killer.
13605,"It's fun I guess. Spend lots of time grinning for new components and tanks. Joking around mid-battle. Until the ""Historically Accurate"" made up tanks that wg made comes up in battle, most of them are too OP and break the fun of it for people fighting against it, like Gravedigger for example it's near impossible to penetrate it's armor through front and side (That is if you have the latest Gun on your Heavy or Tank Destroyer) and has to force you to run to it's back and damage it, that is if you can somehow survive it's autocannon. And I just feel like the event tank are not impossible but hard for someone who play it for free and has to force you to spend money on the game. and lots of stuff I wanted to talk about but I end it here. Nonetheless the game is still fun and I really enjoy it alot"
13606,"Gotta say is decent enough to play and enjoy it but don't expect World Of Tanks on Pc gamplay or graphics like it.
Other then that is a great time killer."
13607,some many errors that it wont wven let you play the game !!!! SUCKS
13608,Seems fun at first but later it will get crap... u will loose over 18000 credits even when u shoot 3/7 tanks and the tanks costs 2 much after IV class. save your energy and nerves 4 another game... don't load this game.
13609,its so thrill and awesome...i had ever feel experience and close call victories in this game than anything..then its also online game...i wish to want include this game in esports tournament..please consider my opinion.Hope m waiting for u answer..
13610,"+ nice and fancy graphics
+ nice small to wide maps
+ a lot of tank
+ Real ww2 tanks
+ easy to control or handle

- KV2 derp gun
- toxic, retard, salty players (they called the team nub or what else)
- expensive gold/premium tanks IMO"
13611,it is impossible to play this game without investing money
13612,Very nice game <3
13613,"Absolutely Fun , [spoiler]better Than the original World of Tanks PC[/spoiler] , if you're budgeting on PC graphics and memory , has vast variety of Tanks that would leave you grinding for more ."
13614,"Gud
"
13615,"This is a GREAT game. ( I think personally.) This is why I think it is a great game, to start the training rooms are just minigames if you don't want to do regular battles. Secondly you can meet some really nice people on this game and then there are the not so nice people. The not so nice people can rage over ANYTHING even the smallest detail. Although they are here they are just as competitive as the next person. So give this game a try and you will hopefully not regret downloading this game. Peace out ✌"
13616,"Is this game free to play?
-Yes
Is it easier than pc version?
-Yes
Is there less cancer in this version of tanks?
-Apart from arty, everything else is the same. Shit teams, bullshit rng and cancerous tanks. 
Is this game playable?
-Yes, but only if you are in a platoon with broken tanks. 

Overall, not worth the headache, just play something else."
13617,very gud
13618,"It is fun all the while having a generally good community with balanced matchmaking, the direct opposite of wot PC lol, the game has quite the grind, but overall it's fun and more competitve ESPECIALLY when you compare it to War Thunder(CHEAT-FS spam) and World of Tanks PC (how do you expect me to deal with an Object 268 v4 in a T 28? lol)"
13619,Good game. Not as realistic and good looking as war thunder but I love it!
13620,какащка ваш блитц
13621,good but why m5 stuart is chinese tank?
13622,"Wargaming make good game!
But they break this game by their own hands.
Wargaming must listen players needs.
If they didn't change, This game have no future."
13623,SUCKS
13624,that really good game... i like it
13625,"too many afk player
finding games in platoon take forever"
13626,"Great game plenty of fun, and sure have spent my share of $$ haha"
13627,:'( So many possibilities yet ceases to be free to play if you have to pay to win
13628,"Don't like it, hp? Penetrates a tank and does nothing to the crew? Shoots the engine and doesn't stop it? Basically, hell no. If it you want to play a stupid arcade game, here ya go. If you want to play an actual decent tank game that isn't that stupid, War Thunder is for you."
13629,"Maybe I'm cheating just a little bit by playing this with a PC, with it being designed for mobile phones, but damn does it make going up the tech tree really easy ;)"

WG YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT TO WERE PLAYERS GET MACHED UP WITH OTHER PLAYERS AT THEIR LEVEL SO THEN PROS DONT GET MACHED UP WITH NOOBS!! PLEASE WG!!! ALSO PUT A MAX TRAINING ROOM COUNT! EVERYONE IS IN TRAINING ROOMS AND NO ONE IS BATTLING SO IT MAKES IT SO HARD TO GRIND!!!!

13640,Great game! Runs great on a I3-6100u at ultra with 4x aa at a locked 60fps! I could play the full pc version but this is better!
13641,I say yes and no. This game is not as fair as war thunder. But it has more tanks countrys than war thunder.
13642,"Good game though it isn´t original WoT, but atleast it doesn´t eats 30 Gb of your PC memory and also doesnt´t require ""supa fast"" RAM or graphic card. 9/10"
13643,Fun & Engaging lol
13644,love it.
13645,"World of Tanks Blitz is a 7vs7 mobile version of the free-to-play PC game World of Tanks.

World of Tanks Blitz is a great way to have fun when you only have a mobile device or tablet. This game has a large number of tanks, the graphics are fine and the gameplay is about what you would expect from a mobile game. The community is and less-communicative in-game than that of the World of Tanks game, but the forums are almost as active. The community of both games is rarely agressive, when compared to other gaming communities.
Another noticeable advantage is the very unnoticeable ammount of bugs or glitches.

One of the downsides is the same for PC World of Tanks: the grind is painful if you don't like the tank you are playing. And most of the time you won't like it, your game time will be mostly spent working towards the tank you actually want to play. Despite the number of unfun tanks, there are also a lot of very fun tanks to play.
Another downside of the game is matchmaking, that can feel unfair most of the time for the lower tier players in the match, although the matchmaking problem is less troublesome than that of the PC version

If you insist to getting this game over the World of Tanks PC even though you don't necessarily play from a tablet or mobile device, I guarantee the original game is going to provide a much better experience, since this version has a lot of content cut from it. 

Personally, I've had great fun with both the World of Tanks games and would recommend to anyone wanting to try a new arcade game.

Overall score:7/10"
13646,fun.
13647,Old Game
13648,Very good game because you can kick Soviet butts with French tanks
13649,"
[h1]This game took so much from me...[/h1]
 [u]My whole life changed (to worse of course) [/u]
 [u]My wallet was occupated by developers [/u]
 [u]My patience is gone after all those battles where i´ve got noob teammates [/u]

After 2400 hours I spent playing this game (1400 mobile + 1000 PC) I just want to say,


Good bye to all amazing people I met playing this game,
Thank you everyone who played with me,
And of course, DON´T spend any money in this game, it´s pointless...
"
13650,As a Russian Gopnik I recommend.
13651,"As an experience, the game has overall been fun. I started back in mid to late 2015 (again in 2016 after my ipad died), and the game was in a good state, releasing content upon content. I wish it was that way now, but I think that the game has lost its excitement, as well as a good chunk of the community. I started to play the game less and less, settling into other games. After coming back, the game seemed as stale as a loaf of bread that was left out on the doorstep for 2 weeks, and I really didn't care much for it.

Anyway, my main issues with the game are as follows:

The developers:
When looking at the current state of the game, I gradually saw more and more that WarGaming was using the platform as a means to an end; an empty profit generator. They create things out of the blue and introduce them into the game simply to make money. Take the 'attachments' for example... Why should anyone pay £10 to £20 just to add a cosmetic that has little to no effect on the 'eye candy' level of your tank? The IS-6's attachment purely adds an MG and an infra-red light on top of the turret, in contrast to a camo, which reinvents your tank's looks! Returning focus, IMO this is becoming a bit too much: legendary camos I can handle, premium tanks and ammo I can handle, but this obviously idiotic way to waste money on the game? No thank you WG.

Content:
The rate of addition of content generally is hard to critique, with a near monthly release of updates. HOWEVER, the quality of content seems to exponentially decrease, which is probably due to the developers running out of ideas.

Balancing:
Powercreeping: the thing the developers use as a quick money grab, while simultaneously breaking it! Though they do balance tanks out according to popular demand, WG never seems to be able to introduce a tank to the game with it being a solid tank. The vehicles, whatever they may be, always seem to be either overpowered or underpowered when they are introduced.

Finally, the community:
The writhing mass of toxic and nuclear waste that is called the community of this game is something that many wouldn't want to associate with... I regularly see people, some streamers, and even the best players in the world being called 'monky' or 'analfabets' (I don't even know). This is a testament to how far a new generation of players has replaced the original playerbase with their stupidity and incompetence. After the sea of degenerates and noobs caught up to the higher tiers, tier 7 and up has just been a cesspool of idiocy and cancer. I hope, for the game's future there will be a revival of appeal for the 'old' players to come back, but currently, it doesn't look like this will happen.

In conclusion: If you get this game, be prepared for every inch of stupidity that you will encounter when scaling the tiers. Be prepared for the unbalanced game you will be thrown into. Be prepared for the measures taken by WG to try to extract every penny out of your pocket. If you choose this game over every other one out there, I wish you luck!"
13652,There is no exit match button in any server which is impossible to leave in the middle of a match.
13653,"It's a mobile game and it shows.
If you're looking for a simple, free to play, strategic game that requires a lot of learning and knowledge. Try it out. 
It's free."
13654,trash community but good gameplay
13655,"its a good game for sure and I have been playing since the bigining on mobile, but if you really want a great tank shooter on pc just play actualy world of tanks not world of tanks blitz, though I guess this game is great if your short on storage
"
13656,"+Great game with minimum hardware requirements.
+Rewards skill and team tactics
+Fun to play with friend in platoon
+very, very very very addictive
+One of the best PvP games out there

-Think positive, it's just a game :)"
13657,KABOOM!
13658,"I originally had this for the mobile and put so many hours into this game, I freaking Love this game!!!!!  I'm not one for Online games but this game shines in my book!   If you will put in the time and effort I can almost guarantee you will love it just as much as me.  Easily a 10/10!"
13659,great game
13660,game is ok tanks become really expensive at higher tiers
13661,good game choose is good
13662,"I THINK THIS RULES
"
13663,Like it play in steam or mobile playing in WC :D
13664,Poop
13665,"This is a great game that I enjoy playing. I like the challange and great fellow online players. The graphics are ok, it is what you would expect for a mobile game. I like the large selection of taks and different tank lines you can chose from. A handfull of the stuff on the mep is destructable but not a lot. 
Don't play the game if your computer has a bunch of back round online activity you will notice a lot of lag durring the game.  Also, it doesn't play well with the figerpad on laptops, so have an actual mouse to play with."
13666,"It's still World of Tanks, so boring as hell."
13667,"World of Tanks Blitz is the mobile version of the popular World of Tanks game that has been ported to PC.

Positives:
-Easy to learn, hard to master
-Lots of Tanks to explore and unlock
-Matches are fast paced and action packed
-Not to bad in the graphics department

Negatives
-Lots of Pay 2 Win mechanics present
-The matchmaking can vary in time, sometimes it's quick...other times it takes a while
-The game really could use a PVE arena, cause of the matchmaking
-Lag spikes can hit and the PING can go off the rails

Conclusion:

World of Tanks Blitz is a fun game, it's easy to learn but can take some practice before your a master Tank Commander. It's worth a look"
13668,"Writing this as someone coming from pc with almost 20k battles, and around 2k on Blitz. I enjoy this game. I enjoy it when I'm in the mood for some stress free tanks, or when I don't have the hardware available for pc tanks.
Or, should I say, *did* enjoy it? I would have given thi a thumbs up if not for spare parts.
If I had to give a number, I'd say that spare parts took 40% of my enjoyment out of the game. 20% would have been more than enough to push me away. I came for some simple arcade tanking, where I wouldn't have to feel like I wasn't using my tanks to their fullest. Now, I can have that for about 3 tanks, and after waiting weeks for them to be equipped.
Yes, this is quite late, but I can honestly say that I played maybe 30 games following the introduction of spare parts and have no intentions of coming back."
13669,"Not as good as the normal World of Tanks, but faster games."
13670,"Ok i was looking for the BIG DADDY version of this game, meaning the propper WoT. Didn't have a clue what BLITZ was about untill i had the miss fortune to download it....BIG MISTAKE!!!!. World of Tanks Blitz is the baby version of WORLD OF TANKS i mean give it a bottle of milk and stick a nappy on it. WARNING! THIS GAME IS SH?T do me a faver and put it to bed and throw it in the bin. Realy the graphics are like something out of a SAGA MEGADRIVE, we're talking 1990's ! only 7 players on a team to a battle. I could say more but i'm glad i didn't pay any money towards it coz..coz....i'm just NUKED about that something so (whatever offensive language you can think of) can crawl out of an app you can get for a phone or tablet and end up on PC."
13671,Спеал фор Кирилл (Пидор) Богданович
13672,after playing this game for many many hours i can say... the people who play this game are full of 10 year old autists
13673,"Okay! I see what you are going for, making the game U N P L A Y A B L E.


Are you trying to balance the fact that you removed HALF OF THE BEST TANKS IN THE GAME BY ADDING 1 GERMAN TECH TREE????

hmmmm... 🤔🤔🤔🤔"
13674,good shit
13675,not bad
13676,Brilliant! Especially when you look at how much fun can be had without ever spending real money.
13677,Tanks Rule! What more to say?
13678,this game is awesome i love it
13679,"very nice
"
13680,"I like this game. It's not up to all the bells and chimes of World of Tanks, but it it still fun."
13681,my boss hate me for playing this game lol
13682,like wot if it was on a phone with half the rtanks
13683,fun and adictive
13684,Add artillery and we'll forget update 5.5 never existed.
13685,"i can recommend this game for thous who not bothered by ranks and stuff... (be competitive here is tiresome and can be bad for your nerves) or for some poor dudes like me who can't afford new and powerful pc and want experience some ridiculous tank pvp battles. 

in the end you must remember that this is ARCADE GAME and beyond historical accuracy there must be BALANCE because first of all this is a GAME.

+:
great for my old, low spec pc.

-:
cancerous player base (especially high tier)

other:
not so much technical issues. sometimes lag but not so often as other games experienced. if you want ""much fps"" you need go full low res but if you just want rect some ipad warriors on your high end pc then it not so big problem. beware of ""ping hours"". may be it's just me but at least once in two month you can experience wotb magic of riding thru the map and other fun stuff. when it's happens i just turn of game to play later.

if you want fun then better do it with some friend of yours. plus more exp and stuff..

high tier is no fun at all. 

"
13686,''World of tanks'' is a great free to play game that could be played with a partner for fun.
13687,I love tanks
13688,"I used to play blitz from the microsoft store but mainly I played WoT console. In general my problem is not with the game but with the comapny (wargaming). They have a hard time listening to the needs of their playerbase, release more and more op tanks making half the tier ten tanks not even viable and having a silver and gold system. If you see silver, gold, and credit in a game, you'll most likely end up spending money on it if you want to actually progress at a reasonable rate. (That goes for any of Wargaming's game) Blitz in itself is pretty cool and ok, but wargaming honestly doesn't deserve the support until they actually fix the major problems ALL of their games face.

Before you say ""WELL YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND MONEY"" cut the crap companys like these target the big spenders on rideiculous deals, it's been a ftp buisness model by many companies to target the addiction addicts and tempt them. And for most of Wargamings games you will have such a far advantage in a premium tank (ANY RUSSIAN TIER 8 PREMIUM HEAVY EXCEPT IS6) that ftp players will be blasted away. 

Their games are high;y addictive and from the perspective of someone who's played all of wargaming's games and spent hundreds of dollers on them, you go nowhere and you alays get fuck over on your purchase in the end."
13689,thats good game ilove it
13690,"A bit more fun than the original WoT mostly because of lack of arty but the changes made to speed things up a bit actually made things more interesting. Cross compatible with mobile players this game is pretty awesome, tons of tanks to unlock, group up with a buddy, and kill some time here and there. I enjoy playing this when i'm out on my phone as well, you can even set it to where you only ever battle other phone users."
13691,"Forced tutorial, no opt out. even after you complete the basics, locked into making choices the game wants you to make. such as forced moving on to next tier, can't choose tank, accidentally clicking a button traps you in a maze of more forced decisions, again, with no ability to opt out until you do what the game wants. What happened to WoT, man? You used to be able to actually play the game. 

Beyond an introductory tutorial on the button map, I see absolutely no reason for continued interference in gameplay. If I wanted the media to decide progression for me, I'd watch a movie. Played less than half an hour, uninstalling."
13692,"Pros 
: - Fast Paced
  - 7 vs 7
  - No Arty
  - Can run in potato

Cons 
: - OP ""Hybird"" Nation tank
  - Pay2Win Event
  - ""Camper"" everywhere
  - Its Grinding Time!!

But overall its fun to play"
13693,"Used to be good, now its the most pay2win game on steam"
13694,da wea
13695,Blitz is better than the standard World of Tanks version. 7 vs 7 is much easier.
13696,the world of warships is way better
13697,Good games
13698,"Better than its Pc counterpart in term of balancing and map design
Not as p2w as the Pc version, in fact, it is quite inaccurate to say the game is p2w imho"
13699,:(
13700,"fucking awesome but please bring back old event tanks
7/10 i love to use myself as a ram"
13701,bouncing ammo  nice one dev .
13702,"It's a great game for mobile, pc doesnt really need this but it is a good game for people who dont run pc's, but potato's with a screen.

The pro's
- Forgiving gameplay
- Easy to learn, hard to master
- devs who actually listen (a bit) to the player base
- it gets more fun as you progress up the tiers

The cons:
- The player base can sometimes give you a very large illnes 
- The graphics are meh
- it's a little bit p2w
- A lot of trolls 
- People who judge you by your stats 

If you are gonna play this, add me: TheDutchPeace, i'd love to platoon with ya'll!"
13703,good Game. i like it
13704,"Pay to Win
Very painful progression system, unless you have a premium account."
13705,It's basically the better version of World of Tanks (I mean the simple version) but unlike the Simple version (inhales) YOU CAN MAKE GOLD WITHOUT WASTING MONEY (still you need to comlpete quests and only some of them give you gold). Still 10/10!
13706,   .
13707,NICE
13708,"Great game, Fast paced and very detailed, I recomendit to everyone. this game can workon normal laptops and you can buy it on your device to."
13709,"I'm a veteran player since 2014 (yes it was only for iOS and Android) and I can say that this game was fun. I had a lot of fun with my friends and clan members but lately the devs have been releasing some event that was clearly aimed to grab people's money. IMO the downfall of WoTb is when they started to release OP fantasy tanks such as the dracula (based on AMX CDC) and Helsing. The event was completeable WITHOUT gold but you need some effort to get it. Few months passed after that event, they released an event called ""Blitz Fair"". This event is basically a gambling machine where you need to collect some tickets and then use that ticket to buy the ""random"" box which can give you some tanks. Of course in order to get that tickets you need to play (only gave you a tiny amount of tickets) and/or pay with gold. Shortly after, they started to release some ""random"" box that we can open it daily. This box is similar with the blitz fair, we can get some premium tanks and other stuffs (gamble again). Also they released some overprice legendary camo (there are some good camos but I don't think it's worth the money). WG keeps releasing legendary camos, especially for higher tier tanks. I know it's business, WG needs revenue but the legendary camos are still not worth it. Lately they did a blitz fair event again and they sold OP fantasy tanks (Dracula and Helsing) in auction with godly overpriced cost. Also, I used to believe that the matchmaker is a random alogarithm but not anymore. I am a unicum player and everytime I bought my favorite tier IX vehicle (to accompany my friend's grind) the matchmaker kept put me in a higher tier matchmaking. It's like the MM is rigged to ruin someone's stats. Problem is, tier X is unbalanced with big guns dominating the battlefield. It makes people's playstyle passive. I really feel like the game isn't enjoyable anymore. Thank you for reading my opinion (yes, it's mine I don't force you all to agree 100%) and sorry for the broken english."
13710,"extremely fun and addictive , i like the blitz bkz it aint complicated like the full version."
13711,The game itself is fine but the matchmaking is a living hell. It takes me upwards of ten minutes to get into a single match and that is after backing out of the queue three or four times.
13712,"I can't recommend this after playing World of Tanks. Feels like an advertisement to get people into the real game. Watered down. Too short. Not fun. 

Just get the real game."
13713,if you want a harder versoin of tank battle then go to war thunder it is much better then this one
13714,Nice
13715,"yo its fun man ;D
"
13716,I think this is super cool.
13717,giant money grab
13718,"Good game for its price. Worth playing if your PC isn´t good for original World of Tanks. Quick,aggresive and fun game with smaller format than original game ( 7v7 instead of 15v15 ). If you don´t mind graphics and shitty community then play it.

Pros:
- Many tanks ( not all nations from original WoT yet - CSR,Sweden and Italy  are  missing  )
- Pretty fun
- Easier to learn to play
- Noob friendly game ( in sniper mode you have marked those areas on which you cant penetrate with red color )
- Many events to play
- Crossplatform
- No annoying artillery
- Smaller size ( It has like 3GB compared to big WoTs 10+ )
- 2 game modes
- Less premium tanks
- Possibility to choose ""play with same platform only"" - Enabling this phone users will meet only phone users and PC users will meet only PC users
- Possibility to get paid goods for free - golds,boosters etc
- Quicker battles
- More maps than original World of Tanks

Cons :
- Graphics
- Community
- Community again
- Those made up premiums are crap
- Many noob players even in higher tiers
- Events are sometimes p2w kinda
- Ping problems ( not for me personally but its known problem of this game )
- Got bored of it after those 222 hours I played. Its pretty much all the same
- Ugly camoflauges for vehicles 
- Camoflauges for vehicles are all the same for every nation
- Slow rate of adding content to the game - China has been added just few months ago

Worth playing if you are only part-time gamer."
13719,this is one of my best games
13720,unbalanced mm plus u need gold inorder to unlock the spare parts per column and this is the stupidest decision that wg ever made
13721,"Well, honestly, this game is very arcade type, compared to war thunder.




-EDIT-

Okay, after playing this game mainly on mobile, I judged this game unfairly. This game IS supposed to be arcade like. It is a game where you have fun and stuff. If you just want to relax and kill some time, just play this game."
13722,"Don't do it, don't waste your money on this sad, ill-conceived excuse of a game. Why?

Too much grinding to do, gets boring after a week or 2.
If you're a F2P player, just don't even bother. Because one way or another, people are gonna recommend that you BUY Premium Time and gold to convert to Free XP later. And the TRASH matchmaking full of trollers and AFKs? I'm not going to even SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT, because it's just so bad, just as bad as FORTNITE'S lack of originality(it's just my opinion, sorry!).

Just don't do it. You're much better off buying Team Fortress 2 weapons and cosmetics or some other cheaper and BETTER stuff than this crap here."
13723,"This game's tutorial is as much of a joke as it's matchmaking and can only be adequately described as an infuriating sack of massochistic glee, literally one of the worst gaming experiences I have ever subjected myself to and that includes the one that stabbed me repeatedly with pins."
13724,i started playing wot 4-5 yrs ago . still didnt make it past tier 5 on pc but got tier 6 in less than 1 year on mobile . nice meme mr wargaming man .
13725,"kinda cool, but lacks a lot of stuff at the same time, few maps a gamemode you get sick of after 2-3 games and simple controls..."
13726,THIS IS A GOOD GAME :)
13727,Can I join test server pls? I have only on pc  172 hours played and on my phone? xD  of curse more than 1 year
13728,sh*** game. they do everything to make your life bad so you gonna spend $. freemium at best.events wich you almost never can finish iven if doing everything from day 1.
13729,"Is fun at first, but the poorly made physics engine and crappy graphics honestly ruin it. It is very much a pay-to-win game, as many steam games are, but this is too extreme, any player that hasn't spent more than £50 is practically instantly destroyed, and is almost impossible to go up in without spending some cash. Would not recommend, sorry."
13730,Get the real version
13731,"Very arcadey, if you want a better tank experience go play War Thunder. It even has plane fights, the arcade for both seems really better and feels more immersive, they both have simulation/realistic battles as well"
13732,"Before you check out this game for PC, you should look for the origninal WOT.   WOT Blitz is PC-WOT for poor people with potato PCs. It has worse physics and netcode.  However, there are a few things that are better in Blitz.  Battles are less time consuming, the 7vs7 player mode lets you have more impact on the battle as a team member. Tanks are cheaper. I just checked: An american T34 tier 8 heavy tank can be bought for 26€.  In WOT PC you would have to pay 45€ or more. Fair enough, there are worlds of quality between the 2 games.
The developers of Blitz are really active. they constantly add new vehicle trees. ok most of the data appear to be converted from the original PC WOT.  But it doesnt matter, if you profit from this as a Blitz player.
Like many reviewers already said, the community in Blitz is quite toxic. Well, its a young player base, I guess. It can indeed be frustrating to see how inactive some players are.  They either sit in base and do nothing, or they rush towards the enemy like a headless chicken.  But I also have to say that the player skill has improved in the recent months.  There were times when i could reliably farm the enemy team with a 65% win rate. It has become more difficult now.
Talking about young players - I have to criticize Blitz's moral on a certain business model element.  Almost every month there is a special even that will let you unlock sweet rewards. To get a tier 3 light tank, you have to do daily missions for a week.  This is still a good balance. However, there are also events with a tier 8 tank as a main prize. They are good items, but they require you to spend waaaay too much time in the game and the game doesnt make it transparent enough. These events are always staged. So, players have a feeling of progression even though they are still far away from the main prize. with every stage you need to grind more.  I believe that 14 year olds will be fixed by the feeling of progression. Its so easy to click on the ""Battle"" button and spend another 5 minutes again. Thats the risk of it."
13733,"I love this game. It's quick to pick up, endless hours of fun, and it goes with you wherever you go. I play this on my tablet all the time when I'm not able to get on a pc. The game is truly free to play, there is no pay to win in this game. I would recommend this game to just about anyone."
13734,"Just another p2w game . Move along unless you have money to burn . You can't even grind out of tier 3 , as you will always be bottom tier . Neither World of Tanks , nor Blitz , nor Warthunder as a matter of fact , none of them get the tank combat right . Unless you pay for premium op shit , you will not be able no even have fun . Also 4/5 matches you get bad teammates , afks and people who don't even know the basics of videogames . Just stay away from anything like this , because devs don't give two craps about fun or balance . 6.5 hours , plus 10.3 hours of War Thunder , plus almost 200 hours on World of Tanks , the normal version kinda give me the right to type this , for those reading and thinking that ""I'm a noob and rushed tiers"". Final verdict : If a more serious developer takes up this idea and releases a full game , without any p2w aspects , it would be good . But we might never get that ."
13735,"great and has fps meter,and normally plays on a potato.i just love it."
13736,"When I started playing this game it was pretty good... it definitely does lean towards pay to win, but it can be fun without that.

The problems have started popping up over the past few version updates. First, the matchmaking has always been ridiculously bad... the servers seem to be able to 'forget' you once in a while, and there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it.

The more recent and more serious problems are these: the devs seem to like 'balancing' things a little too much, tanks can fight differently after an update and with no warning, it's annoying fighting a tank one day and winning and then suddenly losing the next day because your tank was tweaked while you were asleep.

The most serious issue though is the netcode... I don't know what they did, but a game that used to run perfectly fine with no lag and no delays is now extremely laggy (and this is not dependent on ping) and frustrating to play. I remember playing first person shooters on a 33k modem connection and facing less lag than this with pings that were up to 4 times what my ping is now (my current connection is 60Mbps).

If they could fix their netcode and stop messing with the tanks so much, this could be a decent game, but at this point, I regret the money I did put into it (I thought supporting the devs was worth it, but the quality decline since then has not been something I would support)."
13737,"+ Recommended game for low spec PC
+ Great gameplay

- Cancer Player
- PayToWin"
13738,Dont bother unless you enjoy p2w and have no skill. This game is one of the worst p2w games i have ever played.
13739,Just play War Thunder.
13740,a way less better game than a way better game called war thunderit includes planes and tanks and war thunder is way more realistic because ithas multiple parts that damage while you have health and only like 4 parts in wot

13747,"Welp, this game is very great. i don't need to waste 4Gb on my phone just to download this game, but play it on my laptop is more effective from Steam link :) | but still, why the World of Tanks PC isn't in Steam tho? im confused..."
13748,"So, this game has really nice graphics, a decently fun gameplay, and neat things to earn, but I've discovered that it's giving me about a tenth of what I've earned in gameplay. Whether this is a poor tutorial (which I think exsists anyway), or they're actually cheating me out of my time, it was the last straw in my opinion of the game, and coming before it were shots hitting me about an in-game yard away from me, as well as not being able to hit another player with my barrel literally inside of them. I would not reccomend this game, especially to people who get frusterated easily."
13749,"Guys, stop posting reviews about a game if you've played it for 0.1 hours, its fucking retarded. Also, the game is not pay to win, and the matchmaking is not broken, its 1 TIER FUCKING DIFFERENCE! In Normal wot and not blitz there WAS a 3 tier difference so stop fucking crying about the matchmaking on this game, its a fucking dream. Now onto my review, game is great if you got friends, it will take a long time to get to high tiers, but that is what World of tanks is about, the endless grind. In some cases its fun, and some its not, if there was a star system i would rate this game 4.5/5. Its good for learning how stuff works before you play PC World of tanks, the normal version, but normal is alot harder then blitz, pretty fun tho."
13750,"The game is fun, not that hard to understand. Addicting. Also its a well balanced game between paying and non paying.
There is an advantage of paying, but not paying is also just as good and fun! Ive also had no issues with the servers or nothing. Overall a good game. Also the community isnt as toxic as it seems! Ive met some good people on the game."

13755,"I stared to play the original game(not the blitz version) when was in closed beta.
Games should be fun, this scam will frustate you and probably create digestive problems.
I write this review after my 5th rage-quit. I also took their survey and end it with 'stuff it'.
I had a good rating at some point(around 6800), then I think my account was nerfed.

My suggestion: don't spend your money on any of Wargaming games(sorry ... scams), I did and I am sorry about it."
13756,"Listen, after multiple gin and juices and playing a lot of this game, I've decided to write a review.

I started playing the vanilla WoT around 2014 and I loved it. It's a great idea.
Then, came a mobile release which confused me at first, but I gave it a try. Soon after the mobile port came a mobile port to PC port, which was also confusing.

However, Blitz is much better and more forgiving than the normal PC version of WoT from what I've seen.
Why? The battles are much more fast-paced. Sure, some tanks do better while ""kemping in bush,"" but with 7 vs. 7 instead of 15 vs. 15, matches take half the time. And, since the maps or so small, artillery is non-existant which is always a plus.

This game isn't for everyone. Like most MMOs, seasoned veterans will play lower tiers, the same tiers newer player start at and seal club. It's bad, but these people aim to inflate their winrate, not ruin the game for newers players. If you realize that from the start, you'll see that not every single match you play will be awful. Give it time, it takes a bit to learn the game mechanics of armor angling, and map awareness. 

I am by no means a ""unicum"" but if you're looking for a quick  PC to mobile to PC port of a deathmatch MMO/FPS with somewhat historically accurate tanks this is the game for you."

13770,"5 days 3 aim bots 1 speed app applied to skills, 2 shots through buildings bricks"
13771,"Well, I honestly think this game is really cool. I have a 57.95% WR. I have made great friends on here too. The game if extremely good. But there are downsides. Of course like any other online game there are rude and mean people, especially in this game (They are mostly people who are good at the game like unicums or whatever), so it usually gets me mad when I have to deal with stuff like that. Plus, it's kind of  -Pay to win- type game (Which I know it is common in most online games) but it is crazy here. They make events for premium tanks so hard that you WILL need gold to get through it unless you invest hella time and if you are good at the game. Besides this, the game is cool. I would recommend if you are willing to invest time in it and you like fun. But I don't recommend if you get mad easily, or if you you are impatient"
13772,"It is pretty ok for a phone game,but you can see the controls were made for phone.I recommend playing this but only after you played the regular World of Tanks for a bit,to understand the mechanics."
13773,"Sad about no Arty but big deal, you only have a little time and not much enemies, I suppose that is why it has 'Blitz' on the name. ;p"

13775,Brutal.
13776,"I've played the game on my phone before and I really liked the concept but hated touchscreen controls. On PC however it is amazing fun!

I would say it's a good way to kill time if youre getting f**ked off with normal WoT but still want to play tanks. Controls are essentialy the same, no arty, +1 MM so gold isn't realy necessary. Overall great game, graphics aren't even too bad either!"
13777,"I'll make this simple and give you a few pros and cons then my general opinion.

Pros:
It is World of Tanks on a smaller scale, making performance on some tanks much better than the original game.
Seperation of tiers is nowhere near as bad as in WoT PC, if you've played WoT on PC you'll know that you can play tanks two tiers above you, that doesn't exist in here.
Good graphics for a Mobile game which makes it playable on low end laptops. (I use to play WoT on PC but recently the graphics were causing my laptop to overheat)

Cons:
Same ol' Wargaming paywall, some premium tanks are a bit overpowered (Such as the BT-SV) and the Blitz Biathalon is a load of BS. I almost made it through Spring Maneuvers if not for not owning a Tier V tank and it was okay, but the Biathalon features a special currency that can only be earned once. I failed to earn enough of it and can no longer play the event unless I pay gold.
While the uptiered problem is less in this game, it still exists and some tanks are underpowered when they play higher tiers.
The problem of HAVING to play the next tank is very prevalent, as compared to War Thunder where any vehicle can be researched by any vehicle of the same nation, and the garage slots is annoying especially with the more expensive Tier V+ vehicles.

Consesus: While I can complain about WoTB all day, I still enjoy it. I'm pretty good in certain tanks and the game runs well on my laptop. If you suck at the full PC game, I suggest trying this, it is easier and quicker than the other game, not to mention the graphics are easier on laptops. The biggest fault is that Wargaming accounts do not transfer over, which means you have to set up a new account and cannot have the tanks you have in the full game. I would definitely want to see this game expanded and have other nations added (I.E. Czechloslovakia), but would love to see Wargamaing fix some of their major problems.

8/10 pretty good but not without major fault."
13778,"If you played this game after playing World of Warships, its a walk in a park.

Most of your enemies are mostly mobile peasants (they can be identified with slow loading time)

but warning, this game has an extremely toxic community that can compete with LoL's community, you can get a death threat through your PM for every like say 5-6 games.

Just ignore them and continue having fun in your panzer, they are just a salty mobile peasants try harding on a video game.

13779,Good game with good gameplay and interface

13782,"If you want to pay money, this game is probably fun.
If you don't want to pay money, this game is baloney.
The tutorial is terrible, the narrating guidance is annoying, and the battles you're placed in are so OP they're ridiculous.
Oh, and every time you lose, you lose game money which took you forever to earn."

13785,This game can start very slow but after a bit of time it's so much fun!! PLAY IT!
13786,"I´m not a real fan of tanks or WW2 related stuff but i have to admit that this game is really fun.... it´s fun and kinda challenging (Sometimes it get´s personal.... at least for me) at first when you play with the first tanks you get (From tier I to IV) it´s really fun and makes you want to get more... after that.. you realize that is a real pain in the a$$ to get more bigger and powerfull tanks... and sadly, be a Pay 2 win is the most easy way to get those tanks... but if you like challenges and want to get great and powerfull tanks.. (there´s no matter if you take months to get them) go play it.... just give it a try"
13787,"I'm probably going to draw a lot of criticism for saying this:
WOT Blitz is a much more fun than WOT!

It is much more of an arcade game than a sim and thus I find it a lot more fun.
You are far less likely to get one-shotted by a TD lurking on the other side of the map.
The crew skills are universal (all light tanks use your light tank crew), making it less grindy.
Premium ammo is also far less of an issue.

Alas the graphics have been toned down so it works on mobile devices.
If you had blitz mechanics and WOT graphics it would be an awesome game.

Unfortuantly it pales when compared to War Thunder.
Sorry guys, I think WT is far more fun than WOT or WOTB
(Ducks for cover)"
13788,"ITS AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"
13789,The entire game is great!
13790,"Seems good when you start playing, but as you progress you suddenly realise that the game becomes pay to win. Also takes forever to get enough RP to get another tank"
13791,Its a bit unbalanced every match but I think its good :)
13792,"If you're into tanks or multiplayer action games, I think you would assuredly enjoy what World of Tanks Blitz is doing here. It could use a little more variety, perhaps a new mode of play or two, but the game already works very well as it is."
13793,well it's still bias garbage and teams still suck so nothing has really fucking changed including the annoying RP rate so i feel like i'm playing fucking warthunder because only russian tanks do the most damage and recieve the least ammount of damage CONVENIENTLY.

13795,"This is kinda funny to be 70% WR and play against 40%.
Don't play this game, community is so toxic, good players can't play normally, because of this unfair MM."
13796,THIS GAME IS FUCKING STPUID WHY PLAY THIS ON PC WHEN U CAN PLAY THE REAL WOT XD
13797,Warbuging you should do something for community. People are spending millions money and you are doing what? Adding new bugs? Breaking op rare premium low tier tanks just to make game more easy for stupid new noob players who will delete the game after 1 week? Making pay to win events? Selling rare tanks again just to make money? Doing colorful graphic design to make kids interested in spending money? Btw your support is only 1 big shit. I wish I never started this game. Fck you Warbuging
13798,"Pros: Free, relatively small game size, the game will run on potatoes, similar to WoT original/console game.

Cons: It's a 'free' monetised mobile phone game basically. Heavy P2W elements, terribly grindy if you don't pay, despite being a 'casual mobile' game. Compared to the grinds on WoT classic though I suppose it is a 'lite' version.

Conclusion: Unless you're struggling for storage space, just got the real WoT, that's if you're interested in this."

13802,"so this game was fun, before the 4.8.0 update cuz now the game keeps crashing and every battle basicly mostly when i aim then it has a 50/50 chance of crashing but sometimes it will crash out of nowhere even in my garage, for my friend it happened too but not as often (he plays from steam too) so devs fix it or there will be less players"

13805,"This game is unplayable, because of horrible bad MM."
13806,"After this last update I could play like a normal player, winning M's and killing everything... But with this last update, the game crashes too much, i cant play, it crashes lik 5 times per battle."
13807,"Redoing my long ass review and shorting it down to something more simple. Its fun and addicting but honestly stay away if you have never played this as its shockingly toxic playerbase, racist etc. Its a money grab with really low odds gambling and top of that you pay the price of a whole new game just to get 1 tank out of the many hundreds that are in the game.

I only still play as its fun with friends and ive put far too much money and time into the game to fully abandon it. But I am no longer playing as much as its gone down hill over the years."
13808,I use to love this game... then 3.8 happened.  My garage was looted for all of the equipment I had purchased and in its place I was left a small pile of spare parts that was worth about 1/12th of what I'd had prior to 3.8.  I still play and I still enjoy the game but I'm much more hesitant to spend money with WG now.  You never know what the next update will bring...
13809,"Play2win mobile game. Expect a lot of useless players that can't even drive a tank in a straight line on your team. New players have a higher chance to to get a premium tank drop from boxes so expect useless players in high tier games in their new premium tanks which they can't drive. 
Premiums in every tier, so you get premium seal clubber platoons just driving through enemy teams with no problem. 


Lag spikes when a enemy is spotted, shells that go straight through your enemy and don't register and weird graphic glitches are but a few of the problems you will encounter. 

Wargaming, the company who produced Blitz is just destroying the game more and more with each new update. Frequent events that you think would make up for the bad things just end up being impossible to complete and you end up having to buy the tank that you could apparently win at the end. Spoiler, most events are impossible to complete. Everything is about squeezing every last bit of money out of the customer. 

Avoid this game, its toxic player base and money grabbing company that produced it. This game is pure garbage. 

Rather play War Thunder, it's not great but better than this steaming pile.

Edit:2 years later. It has gotten much worse. Everyone is absolute toxic."
13810,7/10
13811,"always gets idiots in team, but somehow get to KV-1s. not reccomented!"
13812,I want PS and XBOX controloer settings
13813,"Play as free. The problem is the game ask to pay as a wish of improvments: to win!! Spent enough time and lost interest logically, had not resourses to resist one class up opponents that even team's work never helps, simply delited the game."
13814,"Fantastic game! When perusing the review section, one might find many complaining of the company's purported greediness.

First of all, from some of the reviews I see people saying ""you need to buy a premium to platoon with more than one player"" First off, this is completely wrong--you don't need to buy a premium to unlock ANYTHING in the game, and even if you do, you can only platoon with ONE player at a time. Perhaps these players are referring to training rooms, which are personal battles for training--to unlock this, you must unlock at least a tier 5 tank--but it can be ANY tier 5 tank, regular or premium.

So as for the game. World of Tanks Blitz is a fantastic game. Full of fast-paced action, the game represents the perfect balance of the PC version, with quicker battles made of quick decision making and rapid planning. For those who haven't tried it, there are 4 types of tanks that play separate roles in the battlefield, and 7 different countries.

Now, about money in the game, because that seems to be the most debated topic--the gameplay and graphics seem to be unquestioned. While it's true that some of Wargaming's recent bundles are a little greedy, offering chests that have 5% probabilities to drop special tanks, these do not need to be bought. Just don't buy the crates. In the game, you can get by by spending little to no money. Sure, it'll be a little slower, but that's the same for any free-to-play game.

I highly recommend this game!"
13815,"no graphic cards no worries, this game runs on everything..."
13816,good game to play when your friends are all offline
13817,HOLLY CRAP IS THIS GAME BAD. I came back to it after a year and it's terrible just terrible. I feel sorry for anyone on ios. The game won't even let me aim the gun half the time and the servers are terrible just horrific. Just get war thunder of you can. Better then this game in every way possible. Trust me i put a lot of time into both games. War thunder is better by a mile.
13818,Good game.Too bad its pay-to-win sometimes.
13819,Game is very very intresting and good
13820,Wargaming. Need I say more?
13821,ye
13822,"The best tank game but gold is difficult to find, so if you spend the money that is better for you :D"
13823,"very good when ur bored
"
13824,"I've been playing for 2 years now with over 500 hrs in total, going from mobile to pc and all i can say that the game was exciting in the beginning but now it's becoming more and more pay to win with wargaming shoving premium tanks in your face that forces you to buy some i order to have fun and the only reason am playing blitz is that i have an old computer that can't handle the pc version witch i really recommend.all in all you should check it out and you may like it but if you have no choice like me i guess you'll get used to it."
13825,"Great game - if you can play it. 
I really liked the game the first day I played, unfortunately from there the experience went down hill. I started to get massive delays in gameplay (not from my connection, no other game I have has a problem). one minute you are happily playing, then your tank just keeps streight on no matter what you do with the controls; then, if you are lucky enough not to have been killed, you appear a good distance away from where you were and have to re-orient yourself, during which tiem you are again lucky if you are not killed. 
A shame as it looks like a good game."
13826,"not bad, even if you dont pay to win you can still get some decent upgrades and kills. good graphics and fast gameplay. Me Rikey"
13827,Mobile UI at Pc a little bit uncomfortable. But you can get used to it quickly.
13828,It`s not a realistic game
13829,"==INTRO==

3rd person tank shooter.

==GAMEPLAY==

Gameplay is straightforward. You and a bunch of other players face off in teams of two in a battlefield. You can upgrade your tank and unlock new ones. Gameplay is confusing and seems unfair, but I probably need to git gud.

==MULTIPLAYER==

Only multiplayer. Community is average, with plenty of players.

==LENGTH==

Unlimited, but if you want to get all the possible tanks without paying money you're going to be gone for a long while.

==DLC==

Despicable. Tons and tons of microtransactions. You're at a huge disadvantage without buying your way to the top.

==MODS==

None that I know of.

==PROS AND CONS==

Pros: Free, fast way to blow some time.

Cons: Basically pay to win, slow to progress otherwise. Confusing to learn at first.

==RECOMMENDATIONS==

Who I would recommend this game to: People who like an uphill battle without pay to win. People who REALLY REALLY love tanks.

Who I wouldn't recommend this game to: Mostly everyone.

==FINAL SCORE==
6.2/10: Microtransaction garbage. Could be a lot of fun without it."

13835,"Matchmaking is broken:

-3-7 minute wait time
-6/10 games you join will be already over
-you cant partner up with friends who are more than one tier above/below you but you can get matched with enemies that are 3 teirs above you


Pros:
Free to play
Tanks"
13836,"There was a time when I have absolutely enjoyed playing this game. Then WG got greedy and made it unplayable. MatchMaking system is a joke. Skilling up new tanks without premium account takes lifetime, especially, when you got stat padding unicums on lower tiers, that fire nothing else but prammo. Actual gameplay: It's not far from it's big brother - packs of lemmings, that rush to death; people with not enough brain cells to breathe and think at the same time; unicums with their low tier premium tanks, firing up nothing byt prammo; people, that get killed in a first minute and call everyone else a noob, idiots etc.

When I first started yes - the teams were not great but at least people had more fun. There was no statistics whoring kids, that call other players that just enjoy the game all sorts of names.

Today in 2018 - I would have think twice before you install this game. Also - think more than five times before you actually splash some $$$ to get some gold/premium account. Unfortunately this game hasn't changed much - 'normal' (not premium) tanks got nerfed, there have been many premiums added, game became un-ejoyable because of stat-padderst and developers that see nothing but $$ and concentrate in adding up more useless content to scam more of your hard earned money.

Now, don't get me wrong - I am one of those that do not mind spending money on a product that is complete and that I enjoy playing. I have many games in my library and many more on CD/DVD media (those times before Steam... :) ). I would have gladly paid for this game and it's premium account if devs were paying more attention to what players say and actioned accordingly. I had played World of Warcraft for years and pad it's subscription with no problem - but the product was completed and Blizzard was actually making this game enjoyable. Can't say that about WG. Neither of their products.

Edit 2022: Same as above. Nothing has changed apart of number of hours I have added to that game. I have lost all positivity towards this product and it's developers. I do like the game but I hate most of people that play it. I guess with my age came less patience to morons and stat-padding whores. There have been few periods I haven't play for months, then came back and got disgusted again.

Download at your own risk. You get free game and with one of most toxic environments you can think of. Sadly :("
13837,"one of my fav games
"
13838,"Awesome Tank Battles, Thumbs Up, Satisfies That Hunger For Short Battles, When Time Permits."
13839,"2021 - Update: The spineless flavour of Wargaming's ABSOLUTELY INSANE grinding/paywall is back, and with a vengeance. It is now almost impossible to get a good amount of credits without paying for boosters or premium account time. The game itself is still good, but I have zero respect for greedy incels. If you're new to Blitz, just play something else on PC, like War Thunder. It has an arcade game mode that is exactly like Blitz, but with way more tanks and nations to play - it also looks like a PC game, not a mobile game.

[strike]Account cross-play (Steam/mobile, register on Steam first, then sign in on mobile, link it to Steam account from accounts menu), really, really makes it stand out.

It is, obviously, steadily aging, but it's going nowhere any time soon. Awesome and efficient lobby system, plenty of players, huge selection of tanks, nations and roles/classes (WANT THE SPGs TOO PLEASE), a revised and improved loot/reward system, as well as the newly implemented boosters, make it a great addition to Steam and your mobile.

All in all, a good 7/10.

2019/2020 - Update: The graphics have improved somewhat, match compensation has been raised (less grinding, yay), and the recently implemented boosters (XP, currency, etc.) are still making my cash overflow, despite not playing all that often; these few changes have made the game all the better to play. It's not War Thunder, or World of Tanks, but the quick matchmaking, short rounds, and novel damage systems make for a pretty solid arcade game.

Have not spent a cent on this, but given the premium lineup for the holidays, I just might.

2020 - Update: Blitz has received various quality of life updates since my last edit; this is still a great way to spend a break, with (normally) sub-five-minute matches and very little grinding.[/strike]"
13840,eh
13841,"this is an......ok game.

the main problems with this game were intentional. 
small cramped maps make tank destroyrs impossible. 
no artillery
no concealment
small tech trees
less tech trees

but all of thos was intentional because this game was MADE for mobile platforms
so it is smaller so lesser devices (like tablets) can run this game. 
if you have a good PC, then just get world of tanks (not blitz, there is a difference) at the wargaming website. 
it is a better game with much more tanks. WOT blitz is just for slower PCs and mobile. 

hope this was helpful! (also, get world of warships, it is an awesome game!)"
13842,It is pretty fun I think.
13843,"I think ive played enough (correct me if i do) that i can judge this game. I propably have 10 hours on mobile and on steam 50 hours. Wot Blitz is a fun and easier that wot but still has a lot of strategy involved. Dont complain having a small map. Its ment for phones!! 
Really good game and i will keep playing untill my sole ends"
13844,Trash game. Trash UI. Need Premium to play with more than 1 friend. Certified Trash.
13845,Trashy game makes you buy a premium if you want to play with more than one of your friends. Navigating in the menu is also super annoying.
13846,Requires premium account to play with more than 1 other friend.
13847,This game is awesome!
13848,"Best tank game around. You shoot enemy tanks with health bars and the only part of your tank that can actually break is the tracks. The game requires a lot of strategy as you tell your entire team to rush one side of the map and if you go the other way you basically screw over your team! So if you like flanking or doing anything remotely interesting you can go to that lame game War Thunder which is just a more arcade version of this (and I heard it has planes too, ew). If you like needing to load a premium ammo type which can pen anything and makes armor completely pointless, then you are going to like this game!  (Oh yeah and don't use tank destroyers as the maps are too tiny for them to sit at a safe distance unspotted!)"
13849,totally unbalanced game most likely unsupporting teams and its basically pay to win game
13850,"Please someone who don't use brain while playing game. This is not for you, if you are not useing brain while playing games. You'll just make team lose and make them angry. If you are not familler with minimap, than you also do not play this game. this game is team play game, and there is no revive or something. do not play this game, if you are not useing brain, or not watching minimap."
13851,it's a decent game but war thunder is the better game out of the two. still recommending it.
13852,"this is not a bad games but it sucks beacuze of the team this is not a team tactical game
"
13853,great game
13854,"Ok basically this game is ""OK"" not the best but fine and that's because of several reasons. Although I would recommend this game so much, to the people that love something called ""GROUP WORK"". So this game is wonderful in it's on way. The idea is great the teach-tree is breath-taking and keeps me at least in hype mood whenever I get the chance to upgrade to the next tier and so on. Plus the major fact of teamwork is very important and it's the main way for a higher chance of winning in a game. Work together and defeat the other team, but sadly most of my gameplay was with teammates that love being an ""LONE-WOLF"" and they end up defeated so goes to my entire team one by one.

That was the in-game with other people, but what makes this games not a great one and just ""OK"" is it's a ""PAY-TO-WIN GAME"" for example there are a section called ""PREMIUM TANKS"" which are mostly on the top of its tier very hard to destroy and even penetrate, unless another way to ""PAY-TO-WIN"" method comes in by you buying a premium tank or ""APCR OR HEAT"" shells that are bought throughout the screen before entering a game and of course they cost gold and gold never comes unless you use you Bank amount. So you just increase your chance of hitting the tougher premium tank like by 30% increased chance. I'm not saying I want it removed but I would love if there is a free way of earning gold in the game without spending real money. and not by watching Advertisements on your mobile and receiving just 10 gold per video that's 30 seconds long and you can do that just 5 times a day, which means just 50 gold per a whole 24 hours. The cheapest and most reliable premium tank costs around 1200 Gold so yeah that's not helpful. I wish and hope for a patch that makes the game fairer or a better way to earn more and a handful of gold per day rather than those useless 50. 

If you read all of what I wrote, then thank you so much for your time and now go and download it, work as a team always and good luck comrade. Never forget your teammates and Platoon Mate!"
13855,great game for those who desire fast paced action and world war 2 tanks
13856,"It's fun, but not as fun as War Thunder. The graphics are seem a little cartoon ish and trying to aim especially while on the move is a task in it self. Overall a good game but I will stick with War Thunder"
13857,fun
13858,nice game
13859,"This i not so much a game as it is a life style. Easy to learn but hard to master. Big community, lots of clans, really fast loading times so no waiting, free stuff. I play everyday for a couple of hours and it never gets old. Give it a go. Really good fun"
13860,"nice poor grapichis
"
13861,This game is utter fucking shit. It's pay to win and it has no challenge to it whatsoever. I recommend you try another f2p game cause this one is shit. Fuck the devs.
13862,Fun game better than most tank games
13863,"Super cool game it has lots of vehicles wrom the WW2 and also the developers are opting for combining fantasy with history, i really like it"
13864,"Shots without damage? Check.
Stupid teammates? Check.
Multiplie bugs? Check.
""We dont even scratch them! Ricochet!"" (when you hit light tank from 152 mm gun)? Check.

Worst MMO-game ever.
You'll have 13 enemies - 7 in the red team and 6 in your own.But, stupid teammates are not your main problem.Without donations u'll suck in ""free"" events and even in regular battles.
Belarussian gamedesign as it is."
13865,Its rrly good game :)
13866,"Thumbs down because wargamming continue to create imaginary indestructible tanks.

This game WAS good. I've played around 10000 games on both of my accounts. Now Wargaming has ruin the game with poor matchmaking and wallet ripping event. Of course you can play without paying a dime, but then you will get stressed by other cancer player."
13867,compared tp war thunder this game is f*cking the knewer cod games there i said it
13868,it good
13869,love this game but do not go American there heavys are garbage and the new chines tanks are just a knock off of the other tanks. and knowing my tanks the chines never even made tanks like that but give it a try u may like it....
13870,"I love this game! It is one of the best games i have played on steam and I hope the updates keep coming!!!
"
13871,Cooool Game... i recommend u all to play this game... its awesome.
13872,fun game when you have money for events
13873,"*whew* where to begin?
Ok number 1 you're on steam yes? you have a PC yes? then just play WOT PC as this version is just not gonna be as good. I got to tier 4 and just stopped as the game repeatedly REPEATEDLY seemed to generate team after team of players who seemed at best.... lost. now i'll admit that it is more beginner friendly with MUCH higher HP pools than PC which allows players to not be instagibbed for one single mistake. also the smaller battle sizes makes it easier to concentrate on what's around you rather than the PC version where you have to watch 29 other players, a bit much IMO. the UI is unfortunate with it being rather clunky in areas (can't research a tank without being right on it's page... what?) and muddy in others.
besides that prepare for YOUR team to sort of muddle their way here and there while the enemy like clockwork moves as a single unstoppable wave over them over and over and over and over until there is no fun to be had.
*sigh* why can't we just get a WWII tank game that's mainly PVE? 
why?"
13874,"Its a fun game but I wish there was a way to play with more then just 1 friend at a time

13875,Fun game if you get it you wount regret it.

13884,I PLAYED WORLD OF TANKS. IS THERE ANY WAY TO SKIP THE TUTORIALS FOR THE OLD PLAYERS?
13885,"Game would be pretty cool if not the matchmaking system - the matchmaking is a joke, you get like 5, 6 or, sometimes, even 10 defeats in a row with score like 1:7, 0:7, very often situations like 6 people from the team are tier 7 and you are tier 6, very bad matchmaking is what WG games are known from pretty well, so no suprises here.
Unless you use premium account - the matchmaking seems to be better when you use premium account, so maybe the mm system is made on purpose in such a way, to get you frustrated and start to think - i need premium account in order to grind effectively."
13886,Very nice game.. easy to play
13887,Hmu for sexual interactive elements
13888,"Its World of Tanks 'Lite' or Diet World of Tanks. But is that necessary a bad thing?
Its not but as far as games go from Wargames (the company) this one is blatantly after your money and divides its fan base by not giving the historical guys what they want (the game is now plagued by fantasy tanks eg dracula tank).
Now I dont mind buying the odd rare tank, gold for upgrading here and there. I dont spend money on coffee throughout the week and thats how I justify it. However in world of tanks and world of warships you dont need to spend real money if you dont want to, in this game its constantly trying to get you to part ways with your cash. It does this through its terrible equipment upgrades where it will take up to 3 days to upgrade after purchasing, or you can spend real cash now to have the upgrade instantly... Yep.
Over the 3 years I played this game I have seen upgrades that meant my past purchases were made null and void. No sorry from the company. 
Therefore if you spent real money on upgrades or a tank with good stats, there is no guarantee that a future update will make your equipment obsolete, or your tank nerfed. This is bad.
World of warships for me is more a stable platform, where I feel its not actively trying to steal money from my wallet. If I do purchase a premium ship or captain points they dont nerf the ship at a later update or invent a new skill point system that makes my past purchase of captain points null.
This would all have been fine if you can play blitz without spending dough, however the game is made so you cant.
I would avoid this in the long run.
PS The game also harbours a terrible and toxic community. Prepared to be followed and trolled by a whinny cry babies spewing cheap insults and demanding you uninstall the game."
13889,Танкисты пид*расы!
13890,still ok for free to play
13891,"I highly recommend this game. It is a free game that is genuinely worthwhile.

While buggy at some parts (mainly, it would not let me have a username even though the user did not already exist, and I could not connect steam to a wargaming account to play mobile), the game is very well fleshed out and most of the tanks are balanced out.

There are microtransactions in the game, however, the game is not pay to win; You are always placed in a match with tanks equal to yours and the speed at which you progress is fair.

The only thing I could ask for is upgraded graphics for PCs but that doesn't affect my gameplay so it really doesn't matter."
13892,Last time i played a ranked match I couldn't capture point D on map Canals. Is this a bug or something?
13893,S H I T
13894,"Don't let my ""Steam hours"" fool you, i've put more hours than a care to admit into this game.  This game used to be great back in it's glory days.  But Wargaming got more and more greedy and made the game more and more pay-to-win with each update.  This is a mobile game first and foremost and along with that comes the terrible buisiness model known throughout the mobile games ecosystem.  This game is fun no doubt.  But this game want's your money and it will shove that in your face every chance it gets.  

Enter at your own risk."
13895,"good but the PC version from the Wargaming.net website is WAY better

This is fun because you get an unfair advantage against all the mobile players with bad controlls"
13896,playable good control luv it
13897,"Great gameplay, good graphics and easy menu. I recommend it!"
13898,"If you're a person who likes grinding in games, this game is for you!

If you're a person who is a Tank Fanatic, this game is definitely for you!

If you're a person who likes spending money to get ahead of other players and realize you need skill in the game later then, this game is just~ for you!

Anyways, the game itself is fun. And~ [spoiler] FYI for the people that play this game ONLY on steam, understand this is also a Mobile game (Played by Mobile players). [/spoiler]

If you wish to play a better version of this game, then get World of Tanks on the website on: 
""[u][url=Wargaming.net]wargaming.net[/url][/u]""

^ This is not to be meant as an Advert. Please don't get the wrong idea )x ^

"
13899,"Stop driving in one group.

I bet I got like 500 hours on the phone, and there is one thing which completely destroys the gameplay sometimes:

Driving in one group. Driving in one group is not a tactic at all. it's just stupid and you WILL get flanked eventually.
World of Tanks and World of Tanks Blitz are both basically about the same goal: map control. The enmy can easily outsmart you or even ambush you if you have no control over the map and no information where the enmy could be.

Stop being dumb, stop driving in one group, do some teamwork. Oh and also try to think a bit more logical, don't attack the one that is low and driving away, attack the one that is fighting against your mates, everybody who doesnt assist his mates keeps complaining about ""not getting helped"" or ""not having a team"" and shit like that in other matches every time he dies.
Some people don't seem to understand this game, it's so freakin simple.

Oh by the way the PC version gives you a MASSIVE advantage over mobile players because of the controls, bigger camera angle and the way more easy-to-toggle-aiming-assist. Its basically some sort of aimbot, in the mobile version you need a button on the screen to toggle it which isnt easy to time.
Now roll out and destroy some mobile scrubs!

(And by the way this is a fast paced mobile game with 7 minute matches, please don't compare this to the normal WOT, they are two completely different games form the play style.)"
13900,"I love this game, high graphic and good feature, but one thing maybe if this game can play more than 8 player in a game that look amazing and more challenge!"
13901,ya yeeeeeet
13902,This is a super mega super extra goooooooood game
13903,Get's boring after a while.
13904,"It was a shame for mobile users that they relased this thing for the PCs.Game turned into ""Ez mode"" for pc users.
Anyway,game is great but later on requires some of your money to improve your gameplay experience by buying premium accounts and tanks etc..
Teams are shitty but you need them in order to win.
7/10."
13905,Decent game I'm having fun playing it!
13906,"It's fun to play this game, the control is okay."
13907,"Honestly one of the best games I've picked up. I don't know what it is that makes it fun, but it's pretty good. One thing I have to say though: it's not for everyone. Not everyone enjoys a mobile game on pc. It also takes certain people to be good at it. It's much easier than the regular W.o.T. version, although for some it's the other way around. It's a niche game, so treat it like it."
13908,"World of tanks Blitz is an amazing cross platform game! The only thing that always needs a little work is the matchmaking, there are some really bad matches such as a heavy tank team V.S. a tank destroyer team, although there is a mix of tanks there are some gaps in it. But overall an amazing game with a huge varity of tanks to fit your playstyle, and its very easy to get involved in it once you learn some of the maps."
13909,amaazing
13910,"I like this better than the full version, honestly."
13911,I Don't know the reason of people like this game so much. Too me it was really boring.
13912,World of Tanks BLITZ jest to gra o czołgach jak sama nazwa wskazuje.mam w tej grze ponad 400 godzin i moge stwierdzić że.Jest to gra nie dla ludzi o słabych nerwach.Jest troche P2W ale czolgami z drzewka mozemy sobie poradzic do momentu kiedy braknie nam pieniedzy.Pózniej już trzeba kupic czołg premium żeby zarabiać kredyty bez czołgów premium sobie nie poradzimy.A jeszcze pózniej musimy kupic konto premium lub pozbierac amulety z misji.Ogólnie polecam tą gre dziekuje za wysłuchanie.
13913,"Feel like im cheating using the steam vers of this game so im going to play this how it is ment to be played. and that is by smartphone. those who play blitz on steam and the windows 10 vers are just making a poor excuse by playing this version against people who are at a severe handicap. i say remove this from steam and get rid of the pc user base off the mobile vers all together! there is a pc version of this game and it is ment to be played on pc not this.

the only reason for this to be on here is to encurage the pay to win aspect that is not present in the pc version and increase their profit gains not bad for them i agree and i understand why they do these things but its not right to mix mobile with a pc user base hince my digusting 63% win rate at almost 2000 games on this new account alone and a 53% winrate on mobile."
13914,It'a a grind feast but a good one.
13915,Great tank sim. Not as large as World of Tanks but just as intense. Do yourself a favor and grind out yourself some tanks. Happy hunting.
13916,"I like playing this game to relaxing and make friends.This is pretty good game for low-end pc (basically its the smartphone version and i have intel hd 3000 which can play it smoothly).You can download mods also (from graphic,tanks camos or even cheat mod that reveal the weak spot to damage the tank effectively ).The things i dont like in this version is they got auto aim which you can lock a tank and destroy it faster(on close range and dont use this to kill heavy tank).Also its not fair when i play this on iphone but i have to face the players that using keyboard and mouse.If you making friends i suggest you remember the player name or write it down.The message will auto deleted when you sign out or close the game(I missed the players who shared fun with me but i simply forgot their name) 
P/s: Best part of the game is there is no fu cking Arty so enjoy it :D
P/s 2:Learn the game mechanic to beat this easily"
13917,very nice game
13918,Its a fun arcade tank game
13919,"
Matches in the game are all the shit and the types of tanks in the game are bad"
13920,"super good
"
13921,Nice for casual gaming. Its easy to use and you wont get whupped as a beginner (unlike other online games)
13922,"Have extra money to spend? Get Addicted to video games? Well you're in luck!, if you play this game, your credit card will blow through cash like there is no tomorrow!, you'll probably have all the premium tanks in a month!, and don't worry, there is more!
If you happen to have every tank in the game, our trustworthy developers will gladly add more, so you can spend the rest of your money on our very exquisite monthly pass, where you will get a very rare ""collectors"" tank. So play our game today."
13923,"Pros: Great way to grind mobile version through computer

Cons: Everything sucks about the mobile version"
13924,While the game itself is enjoyable as of late lag and fps have become a real issue. Gameplay is choppy while near groups of tanks there is a terrible lag when the enemy is spotted. It is much worse when they are spotted en-mass.  This was not the case when STEAM first offered the game and the last two updates were ineffective in dealing with it. A shame as the game is no longer enjoyable due to frustration.
13925,"like war thunder but without everything that makes war thunder good

pros
- tanks are cool ig

cons
-everything else"
13926,"Once i got to tier 3, it seemed like ther was no one in que."
13927,"I am writing this with two minds.  The first is considering the ""fun-factor"" of the mechanics, but the second considers the method of monetization that has been  implemented.

As a game, it is very fun.  The tanks play differently and interact in interesting ways that permit every tank to be fun.  Some tanks are better, some are worse, but all are fun.  I think it's important to find an enjoyable playstyle and pursue tanks that cater to that style.  I typically enjoy faster tanks like the A-20 or Pz 3, but there is a tank for every playstyle.  I woud advise new players to experiment with every tier 1 tank to try to find out what they like.  It's a fun game and I highly recomend that you try it.

With that out of the way, let's talk about money.  This is a Pay-to-Win game.  Sadly.  There are ""Premium"" tanks that can only be acquired with real money.  They don't always break their tier, but they always provide an advantage to their team.  Another factor is the existence of ""Premium"" ammo.  It is possible to buy the ammo with in-game money, but it is prohibitively expensive to do so.  ""Premium"" ammo can change the course of a game.  It will permit a player to breach armor that they could never penetrate without it.  It also deals extra damage.  Those aren't the only ways the game is monetized, but they are the most aggravating.

With all of that said, I still encourage you to try the game, but I feel it only fair to warn you about the annoying tactics that have been employed to encourage players to spend money."
13928,"biased stats...An american tank was shot by me a russian tank 4 times but he survived,i literally hit the side at point blank...but somehow i died when he shot me 3 times...Also i dont understand how some ppl can shoot without aiming from afar its like once they reload they just press mouse1 aiming at me and i get hit"
13929,"Gameplay of this game is very catchy and can be pretty enjoyable, but when you start understanding the base mechanics of the game, you will find out that this game is very pay-to-win based, and you will get pretty big advantage if you just simply use your credit card.

Personally I would recommend this game for more hardcore gamers who don't really mind paying a few dollars for having a special advantage against their opponents, although if you are a free-to-play casual gamer who only wants to have some fun, then I would strongly consider playing this game for more than few dozens of hours because of the frustration and the fact that you're being in a disadvantage."
13930,I've spent some time playing this game both on mobile and PC and it's not too hard unlike the PC version sense most of the people you're fighting are on phones or tablets giving you an unfair advantage.
13931,"This is a solid game for those looking for a smaller WoT.
Decent models, no pop up ads, and team driven gameplay

If you want to succeed in this game you need to trust your team and back them up.
Don't get in your teammates way."
13932,"*My LABOR OF LOVE AWARD Nominee for 2020. WARGAMING kept things interesting for me; the silly stuffs/features have their place. Now in a clan, I haven't tried tournaments yet.

*MAD GAMES event: If you didn't get the hint yet, you could BUY ADDITIONAL COOKIES in common-bonus-containers with in-game credits for a limited number of times within 23+ hours.

Casual gamer here; not into tournaments or clan membership. WOTB is the first free-to-play multiplayer game I got into thanks to a WARHAMMER 40K event promo. I'm enjoying the experience. Although, for a free-to-play, you could end up paying about as much or more than a current TripleA game if you engage with its microtransactions. In less than a week. Or an hour. Yikes. Not the price range I'm willing to part with. Not with so many other games to consider buying.

I'm also trying WAR THUNDER. These two games are very different and I can't recommend one over the other. I'm aware that there's this original WORLD OF TANKS not available here on Steam. Haven't jumped to that one yet.

TIP: If you want to earn in-game gold, install WoTB on your mobile device & watch its advertisements from time-to-time."
13933,HARİKA.
13934,"Locked settings, forced tutorial. They don't just hold your hands, but also chain your feet together."
13935,good game but keeps crashing on some maps
13936,"All was good and haven ...

then my profile is gone ... no trace of 120hr gameplay ...
hear me what happened,
so when I was first told to login i didn't use my wargaming ID, I used my steam ID, naming the profile Avatar_94_MAH
then I have been playing for last quite a time. today when i tried to login it asked for my wargaming ID, i backed the login process as usual and tried login by steam ...
I loged in with a band new tier 1 tank, 50 gold and 20k credit :D 

I love this game ... i loved my tank ... i love u steam ... i love u wargaming for all of ur games WoT, WoW ... for the sake of saint valentine, give me some love, give my profile back ... <3
"
13937,Devolved in to Pay to win loot boxes. Do not play this game.
13938,I thought War Thunder had horrible tanks but this game somehow manages to make itself even worse.
13939,love thí game best game about tanks ever
13940,"One of the best arcade game i have ever played, welp there are some stupid stuff to deal with like battle results wont show up and auto-login expiration, but this game is still awesome!"
13941,wg is a terrible company but the game itself is fun.
13942,"Why would you play this over the normal WoT version is beyond me. 
Graphics are good for a small game, but the hit feedback is just awful, playability sucks, lag is frequent, too few players, UI is real bad. 
Cannot recommend this on PC, if you are on PC, just play the normal version."
13943,"Pay to win, terrible firing mechanism"
13944,id say its pretty fun for a free game
13945,Good game with lots of tanks + fiction tanks with various events
13946,"This game what I can say is:-
1) Matchmaking is still broken (self 55% wr with a 40% wr team)

2) Sometimes allies didn't know what they are actually doing...0% support

3) Allies will rush alone and die as a light/med tank

4) Potato server (getting a solid 80-90 ping overall and still getting like 5-10% loss)

5) People buy tanks and don't even know how to use them properly, making matches isn't fun at all

6) Allies die early due to fact that they didn't sidescrape enough or back off from that position as in Noob plays

7) Players who join clans with stupid names or clan's stupid name are having HIV, AIDS, usually i don't trust them a lot as well, mostly 40%er ruins the fun of winning games

8) Whoever still plays Y5 tanks,i don't trust them a lot carrying the game cuz lack of armor (its a fking Cromwell Chassis)

9) Events to get tanks are seriously high in grinding, making it impossible to get it for free, its like winning 500-1000 matches within 7 days. (unless u have literally nothing to do in life)

For the previous Christmas event, its a grind for snowflakes and each crate holds like 5-10 of em, in order to get the crate, u need Clementines, each match gives u 2 for a win and 1 for a lost...a box??? its around 100+ to open one and.....it increases from opening a crate, 100 pieces to 110

(To EVERYONE who is new to the game or below 5-10 hours of gameplay time in account.....)

10) PAYING TO GET PREMIUMS IN TIERS 6,7,8 DOESN'T EVEN HELP YOU WIN THE GAME"
13947, If u like action this is a game for u. ***** staRS
13948,The worst game I`d ever saw.
13949,Bad game
13950,A very good game
13951,good game
13952,"Ok, lets start of by saying I only recommend this game for compititive players with an IQ higher than a bag of rocks. People are just so awful in this game; we have players running into terrain and shooting at the sky, sometimes not even moving at all, will not stay in groups, and will not help their teamamtes in trouble. The list goes on and on... It really is a fun game though!

It is an arcade tank game it will not be anything like the original World of Tanks (WoT) or War Thunder. It's also not a pay to win, you can level up just fine by grinding and you also get plenty of free rewards like gold and premium tanks by simply participating in tournaments and daily events."
13953,"Very nice game, would recommend if you have a lot of time to waste :)"
13954,Another pay to play. One bad player could ruin the entire team. Only a select few tanks are even any good. Not a fan of the game.
13955,"If you are a new player there is no hope of being competitive as Developers screwed up BIG TIME tank equipment.

Tier 2 and 3 equipment can only be installed with a currency named Spare Parts that can only be obtained through battling and completing missions, and yes it cannot be bought with real money! But why is it so bad then?

Because lets say a player who wants to equip something like 20 tanks, witch can be obtained rather quickly, would require many months of some intense gameplay.
New players will be at a tremendous disadvantage against old players guaranteed! A good analogy would be that an equipped tank is a SCAR-H with a scope and grip and the unequipped is a raw Mp5 with reduced rate of fire.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rough calculation for 20 tanks to be equipped / SP = Spare Parts

1day of optimal results at an average tank tier of 6:
Free daily chests ≅ 1.500 SP
6 missions ≅ 7.000 SP                   
30 battles (48% winrate) ≅ 3.200 SP
Total: 11.700 SP/day

Note: 30 battles would take about 2:30 of gameplay at an average of 5 minutes per battle, more time may be required if a co-op mission shows up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spare Parts and time needed to install 20 tanks at an average tier of 6:

Each tank ≅ 130.000 SP/tank x 20 = 2.600.000 ÷ 11.700 ≅ 223 days.
Note: After you get enough Spare Parts for a slot of equipment there are timers before it actually gets installed, a tier 6 tank requires 10 days unless you spend real money.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

223 days to only have 20 competitive tanks in your garage??? Mind you there are hundreds in this game, non-equipped tanks are a pain to play. Imagine having to play a newly unlocked tank with basic modules (the best modules are unlocked with battle xp) and no equipment!!!!

If you are looking for a game to compete and have fun this will only give you a headache, grinds are terrible because of the infamous Scarce Parts and old players like me will mow you down not because of 
pay to win mechanics (insignificant) but because of Vodka."
13956,"if you have 40 literal potatos connected to a cpu. its a pretty easy game to run.
"
13957,"This is a free to play game, but you are going to have to be patient if you want to move up the tiers without spending any money. 

It is a lot more subtle than you might think and new players really should check out the community forurms and youtube for tips and to get an understanding of how to play. Teamworlk is needed and you do need to build your understanding of the diffeerent roles of the types of tanks and learn their strengths and weaknesses. 

Most of the negative reviews seem to approach the game as a shooter ... where you blast away for points. That is wrong. you will lose reguallry in this game because teams change and balance between them changes too. This is what makes it interesting. 

You can spend a lot of money if you were minded too, but you could also stick to the free option to progress through the game.  Tiers 1-4 are pretty straightforward, but after that you really do need to thnk about how you play and what tactics are needed - even then you will keep losing. If you want to win every time this is not the game for you, but if you are willing to learn and pit yourself against a diverse range of player abilities it can be very absorbing indeed."
13958,"The game is pay to win.
Though it doesn't mean you can't outsmart those wallet warriors, the better the crew, the better it performs, plus those additional items or stuff, you won't really feel the change, so don't buy the items that are really expensive.
And don't go lonewolf, follow your team or atleast let them know where youre heading before complaining that your team didn't help you, and lastly don't be a hero, if you don't know how armor works just stay behind your team mates and munch some HP of some enemy who are trying to be the hero. That's all I can advice you if youre a newbie, if you want to learn more watch some videos on Youtube or something.
(P.S. I don't recommend this to people who gets angry at games. Like seriously bro just don't.)"

13984,Will be better with the update 4.6. Pls arrange the matchmaking much accurate. Overall the best tank game.
13985,Its actually great to see a game like this. The gameplay is great except some tanks are a little op at times. Better then war thunder easily because it runs better and is not more of a pay to win game.
13986,"okay i have like 560 hours in game as of now and a 56.9% wr. i like this game. all the people complaining about it being ""pay to win"" isnt really true. yes, wargaming is greedy and wants you to pay for tanks, but all the premium tanks arent brokenly op. this game is actually kinda hard to learn how to play, which might be why so many people are whining about premium tanks being overpowered. (you cant just jump in and expect to win every game)"
13987,"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TL;DR: 
you either pay for premium, pay2win, or get fucking rek'd 85% of any games you play, irregardless of your skill.
match-making is shnit, and you can't do shnit against premium players.
seriously, this game isn't worth your time OR money. Just move along, find something better!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This would be the last time I pick this game up again.

it was fun going back into it after quitting the first time, won a few matches, bought a few new lighter teir tanks, it felt great being sucked into it all because my first couple of teams were thankfully good and I even managed to destroy four enemy tanks in a row.

Then whatever game incentive/magical unicorn of victory I was riding on, Disapeared. and FAST.

My fustration lies in the fact that after winning like maybe upto 5 battles out of the enemy teams being matched with noobier-noobs than mine, the powers that be thought it best to reverse my role.
7 battles afterwards and I was either innexplicably one-shotted out of nowhere before I could even fire my own gun, and/or my entire team would get steamrolled, which usually ends up with the enemy team Ganking me on all sides.
paying the credits for parts that LOOK and SAY they give you a slight advantage over enemy team just doesn't work. niether is grinding many hours for upgrading crew skill for again, absolute peanuts worth of combat edge.
in the end its all about Luck, or pay2win.
Luck has two components, pray to Jesus that your team is more competent than the other team, or that the other team has fewer premium players. (And that those same premium players don't spot and/or target you first.)

Also when your team is getting rolled, or your getting Ganked, and you keep hearing that plebian yell in your ear: ""Just bounced off!"" or ""We just DINGED HIM!"" my best advice to you is to just roll your tank and present its most vulnarable side, and except your fate.
and if you find that any of these scenerios happen more than a handful of times in a row, and have got you so depressed to the point where your even considering paying for premium, slap yourself in the face and uninstall the game.
hence is what I'm doing after posting this review.
It's also OK to cry, atleast half of the time your losing streak happens is because of matchmaking and finding yourself pitted against premium players that give out more damage and have better armour than you.
After that I'd recommend finding a better game than this one."
13988,k
13989,"Do not confuse this game with World of Tanks.... This game is a knock-off.... To find the original game you need to go to https://worldoftanks.com/  

Both games play about the same. They are PVP.... They ARE BOTH PAY TO WIN :(...
The original game has much better graphics. Both games are basically a set of maps with Tank Battles of 15 PVP 15, unless you set up private battles, are training, or setting up your tank for a battle. That's it tank battles and pay cash for equipment.
The argument that you can play without paying is a lie. Well, only if you want to preview the game, but you can't realistically compete, without paying cash.... The grind is so ridiculously slow without dumping real world cash into it, you will ether give up or buy gold."
13990,Very amazing gamee ever

13992,"if you are not planning to spend money on this game for fast upgrades and gold shells then prepare to suffer

Also , it has the worst team matching ever , i guess you need to play as vip if you want to be with a strong team , god knows what they put in the algorithms

if you will pay money to play , then you will have lots of fun , the game is cool"
13993,"is a nice game :D

"
13994,"Much better experience, than playing on a phone. Still i would only reccomend this if your computer isn't good enough to run the proper game. (World of Tanks) only major issue is the match making of tier 7 behicles, either massive up or downtier. apart from that its fine."
13995,Its a version of WOT that has less stuff and mostly p2w
13996,aids
13997,Another free and nice online game...
13998,"retarded game is retarded, cant even change servers, only 2 players in a party

"
13999,"Interesting to see how mobile games runs at PC, now we are waiting for World of Warships Blitz to come on steam"
14000,Can't wait for world of warships blitz to get added to steam.
14001,"Great game until you get to Tier V then the matchmaking is terrible you're either with some tank Aces or absolute retards.
Only way to keep your win rate up where it was is to buy premium, also after Tier VII you the tanks become very unprofitable so you have to buy coins unless you plan on grinding your way up which becomes very boring... I would rather pay for the game and have better matchmaking..."
14002,i played a little bit of it the game its self is decent and fun to play i wish i can figure out how to buy premiums besides that give it a shot
14003,its a giid game for free so why not?
14004,it's good
14005,A very fun game to have.
14006,Good game
14007,"This game is so replayable, everty month or two they have events. Not only that there are SO MANY tanks to collect. You will not regret playing, give it a try because it's free!"
14008,"for a free game this is shit so many afk ppl in game and the graph are dump 
"
14009,"I like WoT and do recomend it. However, this is the mobil version. i dont know how it handles on a mobil device but as someone who is used to the regular version and was trying to play it on a computer, this version is just too out of wack for me. the diferences arent major but if i had to describe them it would be like someone who wears glasess sudenly had their glasses switched on them. still glasses but it just feels wrong."
14010,"TLDR: It's free and it can be a fun way to waste time so give it a try. Now for all the caveats.

I wouldn't say that it's pay to win but the premium options aren't just cosmetic. You can get an advantage by spending real money. It doesn't make a big difference though, and I find the people who do best are the most experienced ones, while the people who paid for the premium stuff are the dumb kids who wasted their allowance trying to get an edge. This is at least true for the lower tiers, maybe the higher teirs are more dependent on premium stuff.

The community isn't toxic by any means but don't expect much. There are a lot of players who have no clue what they are doing and you may have a team full of them. Then again you might be the one who has no clue what you are doing and who can blame you? It's not like anyone will explain anything to you. But at least there's not much noob hating or whining going on.

There are a whole lot of tanks available in the game. The variety is nice but there is a downside. It can be confusing to try and figure out how to best use any given tank. They have four categories of tanks but not every tank in each category plays the same. And once you figure out how to use a tank well just one mod can change that. With experience you can learn the strengths and weaknesses of any given tank or you can just google them but it's not straightforward at all. This is a big part of why experience matters more than money when it comes to winning this game.

So I suggest that you just try to enjoy the game for what it is. Don't take it too seriously. And please don't give the developers any money. Don't encourage them. They made a decent game but they could make a much better one if they would just stop trying to trick dumb kids out of their allowance and use a more honest business model."
14011,"I have been playing World of Tanks for about 2 years now. the 1st year was fun i found this game so fun i started to spend money on it to get premium account on the go and then started to buy premium tanks to get bigger rewards. after a while i started to notice that as my premium was getting to its last days, any shot i shot at the enemy would not register, my tank started to feel like it was made of paper and i had near to no points scored. i now have a real hate for this game and the people that run the servers in Asia.. Take my advise dont spend any money in this game, they have rigged the game for asians to win and the rest of the world to lose agenst them. THIS GAME IS JUST A CASH COW and that makes this game not fun at all. I would  go away from this game and download War Thunder instead, at least they are fair not like World of Tanks."
14012,"I've played this game since 2014. I still remember when you use the M4 sherman(well for me its the m4) on the tutorial. The graphics look so bad. I alsoplayed in the Ipad. Once this game goes out in steam, i noticed how easy it is to deal damage to enemy team since u use computer. U vs the mobile players. This game is quite childish to me since you got all the accesories like armor value's when you play a battle. Thats really sad, and i wish that thing will be removed because its only for newbie's. Wargaming should remove them when you got a certain amount of  battles and qualifies to be a experienced guy.  BUT, the p2w part doesn't even help. WHY do i have to spend money to f*cking get the event vehicle. If you do the math, you'll figure out why the events are really hard. And i dont have time to do that. As far as grinding, Its quite nice tho. Not that hard. And one more thing is how stupidly a$$h0l3 the players are. They're acting like children and also sometimes can't even get 1k damage. I've been in teams where almost allof them only dealt like 500 damage and thats in t10. I've also seen a guy who has been reported 1500 times for afk.(ASIAN BOSS). War gaming should ban them"
14013,"I don't recommend this game.
Played for 2 hours. Fun game on 1-2 tier. But as you get to the tier 3-4, there are some tanks that you can't do anything to them because you can't penetrate the armor even from the rear. So they force you to buy expensive premium shells, and thats why I'm gonna uninstall this game."
14014,"this is very cool war tank game 
i love it 
try everyone"
14015,"I have been really enjoying this game and getting different vehicles to use.  But now it will not let me into battle whereas when I had won a months worth of premium certificates which have expired. Now i have two incomplete certificates to finish, i am not getting access to the battles.  There are all sorts of deals, but you have to buy the gold, and use the gold to advance.  I have one level 7 vehicle which goes against 5 to 10 level tanks, its a challenge for any lower level.  The upper levels are more coordinated and when ever i have special certs or multipliers working, 70 percent of the time i am the first one killed. even my own team mates seem to assist by blocking my evadasive move.  I stay to the back of the group and still was the first eliminated.  i advance some, but wasted money and effort to the point where only on every seventh game in premium mode would my team knock it out of the park.  What was nice to see, was eveygame was a different set of players for the most part rotating to and from the adversarial team. So the pay to play even though it is free, is offered as an option. since i do not know when i will be able to play, I will spend less time here.  It was fun for the most part, but invisible tanks that do not show up on the map until your 30 feet away is a major disadvantage.  Go ghost red.  Your team is a tough nut to beat.  But the greens did beat you a few times.  I never found myself on a red team.  No matter, green is the way of life (LOL).  I made the artificial grass grow, for a few seconds."
14016,Really fun to play solo or with friends and is a great timekiller. Also great for procrastination
14017,dobre i tyle
14018,"game is filled with bots and the game is horribly pay to win. They advertise being a skill based game when in  reality it's about how many perks and modules you can put on your tank to become overpowered.  I have like 1000 hours on world of tanks and world of tanks blitz is literally no different. 

Also nice review rigging you got their wargaming.net"
14019,What have I just played...
14020,"It is what it is. If you plan on playing with more than one other person you are going to have to get a premium account. Expect to get blown up a lot by other players who can afford to dump cash on the game. If you arent willing to buy gold or tanks with your gold youre pretty much cannon fodder.

UPDATE: After playing this game for a little longer, I still dont recomend it. You have people activly cheating and addmitting it in chat with things like, ""Learn code bro."" and there are so many youtube videos on how to hack the game via cell its rediculas. I have been shot clear across the map through a castle, shot through a mountain,  and had shots that were ""critical"" but no damage was done...from an tank killer to a light. BS. 
I looked to see what the developers were doing about this and aparently they arent doing anything about it.
The game is addicting and fun when you don't have people using these codded cheats, but good luck getting into a round where everyone is playing fair.
If you dont belive me about the cheating, go to youtube, its an eye opener."
14021,"why play this peice of crap when you have pc and console verisons?

14026,"It really is a good game, but people on here have an IQ lower than 40. I mean its incridible just how bad some poeple are at games. If you are not a compititive player then please don't install this game."
14027,"Another pay to win.  Fun, but wealthy players are able to purchase undefeatable tanks.  When you can empty 10 rounds at point blank range and not even scratch premium tanks, that is pay to win."
14028,"Very nice game, I love the feeling of getting new tanks, woooo"
14029,we didn't penetrate their armour !!!
14030,"Fun game. Sometimes frustrating.

EDIT: the game is awful. Bad events coupled with bad rng and a lot of broken tanks make this game unplayable. Oh, did I mentioned new players playing the high tiers? Yeah, its not worth downloading this hot pile of crap in 2020."
14031,bruh
14032,"The players in this game are horribly rude and I remember why I quit playing. With my old profile I did very well. Beings I haven't played in a long time I figured I start everything over. Just like before, even when in the first two places you get rude comments. If it wasn't for this it would be a fun game. I really don't have to listen to all that. DELETED"

14040,"Is it just a dumbed down version of original World of tanks? Yes.
Are controls wonky and definitely not meant for PC, or to be more specific, keyboards? Yes.
Is it pay to win? Kinda. You can grind without gold or premium time but money definitely helps.
Is graphics too bland and sometimes give you a headache? Quite.

Is wrecking mobile peasants fun? Heck yes.
Does barely playing yet exterminating the whole enemy team feel good? You have no idea.
Do android kid tears taste good? A bit salty but god damn hell yeah.

Do I play this just because I suck at the original WoT and want to feel like a good pro player? Yes.

That aside it is pretty fun if you play on your phone or tablet to kill time or have some fun.

14049,Noice game
14050,"Do you hate Artillery in World of Tanks?

Play this. Smaller pool of vehicles compared to actual WOT, and runs on graphics designed for mobile platforms, but it's still fun.

Some highlights
Positives:
-Unlike in WOT, you don't need to rmbr your penetration values and weakpoints on enemy vehicles. Game highlights impenetrable zones in red for your convenience.
- No Artillery! (This gets shifted to mixed if you are an artillery fan in WOT. If you are just remember you are a terrible human being and player)
-Progression through the skill tree is relatively fast compared to actual WOT. Plenty of multipliers on XP events as well.

Mixed
- While i personallya love the inclusion of Fantasy Tanks such as the tanks of Valkyria Chronciles and the inclusion of some vehicles from Warhammer 40,000- some players do not. If realism is what you are looking for this game isn't exactly it.

Negatives
- WG is very cash grabby in this game. Events for limited time tanks are designed to take cash from players if they want premium vehicles: Take a look no further than the (as of this review) recent Blitz Fair event. Getting enough tickets through playing to purchase some of the premiums or get enough random rolls to nab a premium was almost impossible if one works a day job.
- The Upgrade system is controversial. Instead of involving Cash it involves a requirement to have ""Part"" tokens. To get them requires doing daily missions or events but it's very grindy. That said- you don't need to upgrade your tank to win with it.
-Competitive scene is scarce - but WG are trying to make it happen, albeit with not much success.

Ive been playing this game for well over  3 years at this point. I've mostly had a positive experience with it though there have been some low points.
"
14051,"Good fun game BUT dumb stats of tanks too try and lvl things out. Sniper tanks cant see far but there gun is for hitting tanks or other tanks miles away. dumb dumb dumb. Even the mighty teir 10 Grille cant see    sh it   teir 2 tanks have the same view range or better lol sad game. History has this TD and or other tanks  shooting  many shots at the good guys tanks before the good guys can even get in range or ambush them with big gun. But the game is fun even with all the changes in the years of playing all the tanks are different now then what they where. The game makers know that these tanks are not balanced thats why they were made stop fking things up so much. So after all this time I vote so so game $$$$ whores out there wow gold bullets all over there are lots. 

ps    try to play for fun it;s hard sometimes but try..."
14052,"This is a Free-To-Play game, and thus, there is going to be a pay to win aspect of the game, where the head honchos can earn some dosh and profit; however-you do not need to pay to get an advantage. Paying will give you some coins and whatnot, the usual, and access to some ""premium"" tanks, that aren't available for just anyone. 

There is a large variety of tanks spanning your all time common and favourite factions: Britian, United States, Japan, Germany, France and Russia. You know, the usual.. You do not need to pay for a special tank to be good, you have a fine variety to choose from.

World Of Tanks Blitz is a very progressive game. Each tank has a tier to it, and the lower tier tanks, can only play on certain maps, say three, and the higher tier your tank is, the more maps it opens up. So basically, you want to progress with a good tier tank so that your not stuck playing only three maps every time you play. And the maps that are unlocked with a higher tier tank are so worth it.

It's like any other tank game of this nature, really. It isn't difficult to grasp the concept and gameplay, which makes it a relatively easy game to get into if you're new at it."
14053,The game is a lot of fun to play (remember to push shift so you have sniper vision). The problem is you can play against other players you cannot damage whatsoever. They just ram into you and shoot you till your dead and your gun does not hurt them at all. Strange way to make a shooter.
14054,"I really really think this game is great..However the only issue I faced is when you Disconnect your account after updating it. It will wipe everything I still haven't found a way to re update that same account to play on it again... So be careful on what you press on XD
."
14055,It not good
14056,"It's like world of tanks but watered down into an arcade windows 7 game.
Reasons for thumbs up:  It's free and the game is super fast pace (5 minutes or so games)

Reasons if I did do a thumbs down: Visuals - needs better targeting colors, etc."
14057,"Needs voice chat, and settings page for game controllers. First WOT was better than this.

If I'm missing something here, and these options do exist, please point them out to me.


EDIT:

Changede my review of this a bit...

It's a horrible version of the game... for PC. Wargaming.net had this to say about the framerate cap on PC clients...

From: Leo Mayer January 18, 2018 11:47 AM

""Hello Commander,

At the moment, option ""120 FPS"" available only for some iOS devices, which successfully passed tests for it.
Unfortunately, in the near future, the adding of the ""120FPS"" function for the Steam game client is not planned.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

14058,"i like the game. Its really fun killing other enemy tanks. This game is the fighting of tanks and this one event is on right ""creator""? this event is the wariors of the cold calculation of ice and the dreaded rage of fire.
"
14059,"I think it's good alternative to normal wot for low end computers, also if you are travelling alot you can continue playing on your phone or tablet, which is great. I personally like it more than normal wot since I'm more of a casual gamer and wot blitz is kind of easier.

So I would recommend it to casual gamers with potato computers, but don't expect any historical accuracy, since even normal wot is more of a arcade game than a simulator, for that, I reccomend War Thunder.

Good game 7.5/10"
14060,"cool

14061,Very Nice!
14062,This is cross platforming ! This would be unfair because pc control is much easier than phone ....

14065,Great!

But yes I still play.









Why are you still here, Leave."
14067,"Very fun game, although please make it a little bit easier to earn gold, silver and experience. Currently I have an M3 Lee and I've been playing for 2 weeks now so please make it a bit easier. Thanks for reading my review."
14068,"I've played this game for a LONG TIME even before it is placed on Steam. People that say this game is Pay2Win needs to learn how to play the game more to know that there are ways to counter Premium tanks, Tanks with big Derpy guns like the KV2 or SU , and premium Bullets. Just look it up"
14069,great game
14070,gg
14071,great way to waste time
14072,"This is a fun game!  Lots of action with room for growth and expertise.  If you like to excel, you can develop your tanks and get better! But, that's where it ends unless you pay the cash!!!!.  You will find that many times, round after round, that you will be deluged with opponents who are much faster in speed, even though your ranked with the same categories.  Their armor seems to be thicker, take multiple hits, up into the teens, where you can get destroyed with one to three hits by ammunition that is more powerful! Bought with Gold I'm sure.   It isn't hard to realize these have been purchased, where your side doesn't have overwhelming attack capabilities!!!  There is a lot of dissension on the discussion boards about this.  Some say that more skill is needed.  When you find yourself losing with 6 to 7 opponent tanks standing to none on your side on many, many, many occasions.  It is not hard to realize that this game is designed to cause fraustration so that you can get your ""Mommy"" to buy you a $100.00 tank!!  It's all designed to manipulate people to pay money for this game.  An if you show negativity, they will let you know!  The game is biased for a reason!!  I play it, but I'm getting so tired of one-sided battles!   Over and over and over again, then you get matched with equals and it is a lot of fun, but trust me it won't last!  The store bought tanks always are ranked against you again.  Overall, I give this a thumbs down!!  It's a shame, because it could really be a great game!!"

14083,"It's very fun! I'm very glad that I had installed it.
Although, it's kinda of a pay2win game. Still, you could kinda make your way up with freexp and/or gold.
"
14084,"The game is simply great with small issues.  It is possible to play it without money, but you have to spend more time with some credit grinders around tier 5 to support higher tiers with money. I have personally bayed few golds (as an small thanks to developers) to make ""Sherman"" premium (or how it is called), therefore it grinds about 40% more money. With 15-30k of money per normal round you can play higher tiers with couple premium shells in each round which doesn't ruin your overall credit balance.
The game is great because of shell and camouflage physics implemented. It reminds me old good Counter-Strike feeling of cooperation with team. For successful game play you have to known well maps (which parts provide which advantages and disadvantages), your vehicles pros and cons (and others vehicles , especially their cons) and you have to consider tactic and consequences based on yours and opponents team structure.

The win ration could be enhanced when played with skilled player in platoon. I do have currently over 65% (>4000 games played) but not playing in platoon, and it seems to be sanctioned by games MM with team members with 40-50% win rates.

Overall it is great time for me to play it and this game and to move forward with new and higher tiered tanks."
14085,A good game I just like it because it's a lot simpler than the other version so don't be discouraged by others.
14086,"This is a GREAT introduction to war games for gaming rookies!  If you are an old veteran, the graphics and game play might be too simple, but for someone who is new to MMO and can't yet handle a different command for every key on the keyboard, this is a great place to start."

14091,Its a fun game but its the phone verson. steam can you pleeze get the pc verson on here to?
14092,"The game has come a long way, and still in a net-positive manner I believe. I would even say that if you can get over the mobile platforming and related adjustments, it might be better than the PC counterpart (which shares similar and unique issues of its own). Everything has gone up, tank stats (natural powercreep), prices (yes, still exorbitant at times), and game problems, but also player activity, outreach, and new content (e.g. improved graphics, new vehicles and gamemodes, events, etc.). The game has become infinitely more friendly towards new and F2P players: better tutorials, easier events, and more way to get resources like boosters, camos, credits, even gold. I think the game will continue to improve."

Only for those who are willing to grind... and grind, and grind.

You get the picture."
14111,"dont play this if you care with your mental health. Idk the dev just sucks. They dont care with the ""amazing"" RNG in this game. Also the mm. Once u lose, u can't win. It'll constantly gives u unreliable player with low stat, so you'll lose again and again and again until u rage quitting. Actually, the same thing happen when u win, but hey, who in the bloody earth wants to get a lose streak?

Edit : I've been playing for more hours since then and it still a pain in the ass. I have second acc and started from the beginning. I thought it gonna be a fresh start for me to get a decent stat. And if you think it worked, damn boi you totally wrong in there. Here's the thing, not so many player in tier 1 until 4, and so the (gEnIuS) Dev create bots to make the battle 7vs7. Clever solution eh? Bloody hell no. The bots reacts so fast in term of shooting you and it's also amazingly accurate, sounds great but this only works in enemy bots. How about in your team? They dummy as hell. Act only as a suicidal filler that run through enemies and do bloody nothing. And what's great is this effect escalated as your stat getting better. The devs dont like when u have 70++% winrate. I guess because the devs come from a former communist country and they still grasp that ideology which is everyone is equal, literally equal in terms of winrate, avg damage, and everything.

EXCEPT, for those who already spend 1000$++ on this game, u dont have to read this cause u will be a milking cow for them. After all, it's a good game with bloody hell greedy devs. Kudos to them! ;)"

14120,"Even thought the PC version of WoT is up for grabs, Blitz is great for those types of people who have bad computers, don't like artillery, or for those who want a fresh start without having to create a new account and such.

"
14121,VERY GOOD OPTIMIZED!
14122,actually stupid
14123,"Don't play this game, it sucks, if you're going to play any version of this shitty game, play the normal PC version which is also available for free and has way much more of a player-base than this one does."
14124,"Nice game, multi-players, you have to teamwork to win a battle"
14125,"worked great until it didnt connect to their servers anymore, even after uninstalling and reinstalling"
14126,"One main point and it is a game ruiner. RNG. The RNG in this game is obcenely broken and out of the hours i have played this game i have won about 7 games.  To make matters worse if you pay to get premium tanks and parts you basically just won the game right there and then. 

Metric tons of potential ready to be ingnited but it is raining on your parade."
14127,"this game is not warthunder its a completly different play becaus its a completly different game  there is a stratagy  to it and a way to win.
there is a good side to the community and then theres the morons who think there the best at evrything even when there the first to die and did the least amount of dmg those guys you just ignore and keep playing"
14128,"eh.... it was fun.... but too many microtransactions tbh.... Getting a Tier X from scratch without spending any cash will take you like at least 1000 battles, and of course I doubt anyone would focus on only one tank... For me it took me 4.5k battles to earn my tier X. 
This game is kinda P2W.... don't really recommend it anymore, the fun is just gone.
Some tanks are just garbage.... like the Vindicator UM, Gravedigger, IS-3 defender, etc. Those unrealistic tanks just kind of ruin the game for me (no, not because of their stats, but because they look ugly as fuck and make no sense at all) Every single tim e I see a tank that's not history-based kills the game for me, it just doesn't fit."
14129,the waiting in queue is too long.
14130,"[i] Note: i have played about 14000 games of blitz and 5000 games of pc wot, so my steam hours are by far not everything.[/i]

This game is just like real life: it requires a lot of skill but is mostly based on luck. The grinding possibilities are almost endless! Also you will never have to go to the shop to buy salt again. Brought to you by wargayming. 

To be serious though, it is a fun game but there are a lot of annoying aspects to it, would get 6/10 from me."
14131,"I thoroughly enjoy this game.
While it was originally a mobile 'port' of the original, It's since become it's own game.

To some, this may seem just a watered down version of the 'full' game, I like it because of the smaller games. I'm not gonna say stuff about how it, 'makes for more strategic gameplay' or 'makes it more fun', because that's not something I have any real knowledge in. What I will say though, is that it (normally) means that battles are quicker, and so if you, say, forget to load any shells when you upgrade your gun, you don't have to spend ages waiting for the tank to return from battle so you can load them.
There's also the matter of cross-platfrom compatibility. I REALLY like this. Given it's exactly the same game on Steam as on Mobile, you can simply hop on the same bandwagon with a friend who lacks a computer.

However, with all that silver lining, there's still a cloud. The biggest issue I've found is that while the graphics are quite good for a mobile game, it being one of the better ones out there for the graphics, On computer they are quite lack-luster. Look, it's not difficult to add some more options on PC for higher quality trees and grass and whatever. As long as there is no change to the gameplay, there shouldn't be a problem. After all, with the current graphic settings, You can join games even with different levels of grass waviness, so why not make it ultra-realistic for computers that are able to handle that stuff?

Over all, I enjoy this game. A lot. 8/10 would play again and all that. But if you haven't already got a good start on your phone, it's probably best to stick to the big brother of this. World of Tanks."
14132,"Pay to win, or grind your social life away.

Free to play though!"
14133,"Makes me mad, but really somehow, I cant stop playing
"
14134,Too much hand-holding in the beginning. Got boring very quickly.
14135,Fok jouw noam
14136,"Even though this game came from mobile it's pretty cool to have it on PC and it's not that demanding on graphics. Gameplay is just the same as regular WoT (except in Blitz it's 7v7) and you really don't need to buy anything(if you just want premium tanks, boosters, or to use for free exp). I mean I got far on some of the lines and I usually have most of my tanks fully researched and upgraded. It's best to platoon with someone you know. The only annoying part is when you have some afkers or your team just rushes and gets overwhelmed by the enemy team, people being salty because you ammo racked that one, etc etc. Other then that if you like tank battles this game is for you or for those who just recently finished or a fan of GuP. If I have to give a score I would say maybe a 9.1/10. 

Before you ask. Is this game pay 2 win? No it's f*cking not. Just because Wargaming puts out a 50 dollar premium tank or in bundle doesn't make it good. Your skill does. Also don't rely on APCR / prammo too much because you will burn alot of credits if you use it all the time and you will be broke like America was 88 years ago during the Great Depression. I personally fire one if I cannot pen a tank. 

Reasons people buy premium tanks?
1. They can make alot of credits for doing a lot of damage (remember getting kills isn't important, if you do a lot of damage the game will reward you alot of credits. So go support your team)

2. Premium tanks have elite experience which you can convert to free exp with gold or use the elite experience to train crew skills which is very helpful (if you have let says 104k of exp for one tank you can use it to level up a crew skill or you can use as free exp to research module). The plenty of elite exp, the more you can use it for skills and to help lower the grind for modules you need. 

3. Some people buy them as a collection or novelities like the Valkyrie Chronicles Tanks, the Girls und Panzer tanks, or basically they just like them.

Also I would like to add this in. If you're going to be a retard and rush in and then sh*t talk the team saying we're bad doesn't make you a good player. RUSHING AND DYING IS NOT A F*CKING TACTIC. Too many idiots don't learn how to use strategy."
14137,"I hate this game and I love it. 

I personally think this game is birlliantly made due to teh fact that I love amored warfare, but there are some major mechanics in the game that bug me like when I'm looking at a enemy directly in the face he just dissapears into thin air, and then continues to shoot you and not being highlighted.

Overall I would reccomend this game just a few small things thta bug me."
14138,I'm a huge World War 2 fan. And of course my favorite part of the war is the tanks. This game is amazing! I only have 5 hrs. into this and I'm addicted! If you are a atnk lover like me I highly recommend this game!
14139,Big armored bag a fun
14140,"Other than Warthunder Groundforces, this is the next best tank simulator out here on steam. However, this doesnt compare to the actual World of Tanks game on PC."
14141,look at mah face
14142,"Nice game with good graphics!!
However the server is not good and the matchmaking is totally bad..
Normal WOT was better than blitz version...!"
14143,"I like this game, but I have lots of trouble with ""in battle"" performance. My system is in game spects. Im no computer wiz, so figuring how to fix the issues was such a pain! It seemed as soon as i figured out an issue, an new update with new problems! I felt like pounding my head against the wall! Also I am forced to use satellite internet and the huge lag time increases the difficulty of my game play!"
14144,lol funney
14145,"Boring and not fun just a terrible game I am aware its a phone game and it should stay that way, just play the normal world of tanks its better and more fun."
14146,"Not a good game, but boi is it addictive!"

14161,"I've been having a problem with WoT Blitz: Every time I come online I need to reinstall the game again. I dont know why it is, but its very frustrating. Is that just a problem with this game or can it happen to any game on Steam?
I'd really appreciate if somebody could help me with a fix."

...uninstalled right away."
14170,"The only positive thing about this gamer is the maps. 

Worst parts are:
commands are unresponsive and slow
3rd person visual is messy (i wasn't able to identify what disturbed me of the visual exactly)

I'd say it's unplayable.

Too bad. it shows lots and lots of potential, but completely unused and undeveloped
"
14171,Toys compared to War Thunder. Play it for free but don't invest in it. Tried World of tanks out of Steam and it's the same thing...Arcade toys
14172,"Can be fun, but it isn't as fancy as other tank game options.  Just don't get too picky with what happens to your account.  It hasn't been easy to get things repaired, so far.  Steam won't help since it is a third party game and the support guys don't seem to comprehend how to fix issues.  Somehow they replaced one account with another I had started the first time I uploaded the game through Steam, which took away many hours of play and progress.  Then they said they couldn't switch accounts like they had just done.  Maybe it was Steam that did the switch to keep my old player name, but getting things fixed turned into a nightmare that never was resolved."
14173,WARNING! P2W MONEY TRAP!

14175,"I liked tanks all the time, but it's .. In this game there is no balance, you start to play, 6 level is completely leaked to you. I'm in shock. it's impossible to play WoT Tanks, at least, it was better before. A huge plus cross-platform. But guys, balance correct"
14176,"Classic flawed game though interesting PVP tank setting liken CSGO style; only thing is slower, rigged and much more hackable with mods.

Also its full of toxic players in the SEA, especially Pinoys who does nothing constructive/productive to team play but cuss cuss cuss yet game mods do NOTHING to them.

1. Rigged play; some players are virtually feeding right from the start, spotting, seeking enemies like on steroids, later to cuss team mates for not covering them in impossible situations.

2. Bad game match-ups; 50% WR players often playing snooze if not u are always pitched with the 40% WR players who either don't know anything abt the game or simply just dun care, not at lower beginner tiers (Tier 1~5) but late or intermediate to expert level tiers (6~9)
Even the highest skill level tier also have idiots that are seriously lacking in the skills but have all the tanks to play.

3. Hackable with help assist mod-skins that can see weak points; For this, refer 'g2g WOTB' in google search.
They are also even selling accounts which shows why and how there's so many spawn new accounts for sale etc.

4. All items in game, especially useful ones like tanks, are not dropped, if not its 0.0001% which every 1000 game u get maybe 0.01% chance get 1 tank drop and that tank is dirt or not usable without hacks.

Latest updates:
Open hacks can be found - WOTbaza as well as 2 Malaysian companies actively churning accounts for sales etc
Google and search for 'WOTB hacks' 'WOTbaza' 'g2g' 'playerauction_WOTB'.

Lists of clans/players/nicks here soon as proof of this game is so faked and rigged to cater other players/clans/nicks to constantly win.

Clans:-
- CAPAN (Their players comprises of deliberate feeders and impossible marksman where u get shot behind rocks/building covers or often over 350m away where no sight is possible.
- LEOLE (virtually their whole clan are inconsistent players; mainly they either go kill-monger or campfire makers at BASE right from the start)
- AUSSIE (Clan with racists and dumb players, also they can have full HP tanks but not doing any teamwork to kill of even a 1hp enemy, just cos they are stock tank!)
- PHP-affiliates (Toxic group of players in these affiliates are using any tanks like LT/HT/MT as sniper and not doing their core roles, and when dead they blame others or makes alot of irrelevant comments in game; text/audio.)
- UZB-affiliates (a mixture of LEOLE and CAPAN player-like style)

Recommended to play with friends who can carry a little while u can also help cover their dead angles well.
Otherwise go play CSGO better....perks and rewards much better than this game."

14195,In a 7v7 you still can't change the outcome of a overkill matchup.  Most matchups are pretty overkill 1-side biased.  I see this game as more of a personal tank collection.

14217,There's already a WoT game on PC
14218,"I am a long time World of Tanks Player, Playing Blitz is Like playing a stripped down version of World of Tanks, it has taken what was good from World of Tanksand put is own twist on it. It feels like playing World of Tanks when it was first Released."
14219,"Infuriatingly unbalanced. 

I initially dove head first into this game and played it like it was a drug. The first few levels are very easy to progress through and the amount of garage space you get to work with allows you to make substantial progress unlocking new tanks and upgrades right out of the gate. After that, this game falls off a cliff. 

First off, the multiplayer is unbalanced as fuck. I counted 14 games in a row where I was matched with people playing at a higher tier than my tank at one point, and only 2 out of maybe 20 games where a majority of players were actually within my tier. My tanks were NOT fully upgraded, but for some fucking reason I was CONSTANTLY pitted against opponents with higher level tanks than mine

Second, there's no 'ranked' mode where people can actually test to see how good of a player they are for lower tiers. There is a ranked mode at level 9 and 10, the highest in the game, but you'd have to grind for an absurd amount of time to get there, assuming you dont infuriatingly lose your patience well before then the way I did. Your stats are completely dictated by how your teammates do, a vast majority of whom prefer to hide in a bush and snipe from across the map rather then try to take objectives. 

Third, Single shots from higher tier tanks almost ALWAYS will knock out your tracks or your engine, completely fucking marooning you in the middle of a field where half the enemy team take turns pounding you with fire, usually while my teammates are nowhere to be seen. There are consumables you can buy for instant repairs, but they hardly do you any good because some other tank will fire one shot at you and accomplish the exact same thing. This issue is amplified if youre unlucky enough to CONSTANTLY BE MATCHED WITH HIGHER TIERED TANKS like I was on a regular basis. 

Fourth, the chat in the game is infuriating to use. Theres a character limit on what you can type meaning you cant point out where youre getting shot from or what the strategy of the team will be, and at the end of the game when im staring down a 2v5 because my teammates are all dead, the chat will quit on you and not let you type anything even when you open it. It simply opens and closes until the next match begins which only adds to the infuriation of this game. Not only does the bull shit hit you via matchmaking and gameplay, you cant even type anything about the bull shit either. 

Im sure this game gets tons of praise because its free, simple, and great graphics, which I dont deny nor dispute, but the other aspects of the game are simply infuriating which in a game designed to be completely multiplayer are simply unacceptable and intolerable. The game starts out great but then becomes horrendously unbalanced, with fine layers of other bullshit layered on for fuck knows why. 

Give the game a try if you want, its free after all, but I dont recommend playing it because the game prevents individual skill from impacting how you do in the game. Its all dependent on the tier youre matched up against (Almost always higher than you), and the performance of teammates (who dont follow objectives)."
14220,"Exciting and fast paced 7v7 game. If you enjoy multiplayer PVP that's very intense and heart-racing then I highly recommend this game. WoW Blitz is also well balanced, avoiding the pitfalls of P2W"
14221,Peace of shit. This is not game. This is PAY 2 WIN.
14222,"No way to get gold on PC without p2w or unlikey chest grinds

14271,"THE GOOD:
ITS ADDICTIVE! And can be both horribly frustrating and incredibly fun to play.
You will prefer Blitz to W.O.T PC if you like the reduced wait times and smaller maps.
Easy to learn and hard to master.
Devs seem to do a one step forward and one step back with most updates. (improving some features while ruining others)
Not ""pay to win"", but definitely ""pay to reduce the grind"". You can totally enjoy this game without spending a dime.
Learn to play by reading tutorials and watching videos, and master a tier before leveling up and you will be a much better player and enjoy the game much more. (Because winning is more fun than losing. lol)
Its about the journey, not the destination. (ie: enjoy the grind)

THE BAD:
*My main complaint: I wish the matchmaking would be improved so the teams are more evenly balanced (not just by type and level of tank but ALSO BY PLAYER SKILL), it can be infuriating when you are put on a team of afk's, noobs and bad players when the other team has mostly good players and so no matter how great you play you are left alone and outnumbered very fast, and despite dealing the most damage and kills you die quickly in too short of a match. Or your team wins in a 7 to 0 blowout and if you are driving a slow tank the battle can be over before you even see an enemy tank.
This extreme team imbalancing happens way too often and is the biggest flaw the game has.
If there was an even number of bad players on each team then it would mostly cease to be a problem. 

Don't expect a tank sim or even semi-realistic experience anymore.
The game used to be a lot better, but some terrible major updates have really hurt the game. Update 5.5 in particular sucked all the fun out of  the lower tiers (you wont revisit them now after learning the game) and put a lot of bad players in higher tiers where they dont belong. The constant nerfing/creeping of tanks and lines you have spent hours working on under the never ending claim of ""balancing"" seems like just a greedy attempt to get money from new players and the gullible.

Originally a game based on real  and prototype tanks that actually existed, they are constantly introducing cartoon/fantasy tanks to appeal to children and get their parents money. Prepare to be bombarded with temporary ridiculous camouflages and useless avatars to try to get you to spend your cash.

The regular prices they ask for tanks and items are RIDICULOUS!

I dont recommend paying any money to support the billionaire devs until they fix the matchmaking, but if you do ALWAYS wait for 70% - 80% off sales, never pay full price!

TL;DR
Definately not perfect (the matchmaking can be terrible), but still recommended with reservations.

Used to be 8 out of 10, now its 6 out of 10."

can you add something new please :)
like new large map or make a little chance the grafik
and etc


This game is good but it seems like diffrent 
when we watch the trailer on youtube or

14279,"Every time you get a new tank, it will require 20-100+ games to full upgrade it, and you will be punished in your stats if you don't pay real money to instantly upgrade it.

If you play tier 7+ you can usually make a credit loss on wins even with a premium account. Active players usually only play (real money) enriched tanks or premium tanks."
14280,BUNCH OF IDIOTS AND AFK'S ARE JUST RUINING THE GAME AND WARGAMING HAS NO DAMN PLAN TO STOP THEM
14281,this game is good for a less powerful computer and a good alternative to the actual World of Tanks it has nearly the same features but if you computer is not that good this is a good and free alternative to World of Tanks.
14282,i got lock out of my acc
14283,"Fun, quick & fast paced. Great for having a little fun if you don't want to get bothered with all crappy usual MMO stuff.
Loses points on ease of use of UI.

7.5/10"
14284,"Play the non-mobile version of this game. Much better, more friendly to new players, and is not as money requiring. Also a lot of free stuff gets given or is earnable for NA server players on the normal version of the game."
14285,"11/9 game would recommend

[spoiler]youll get rekt at the start THEN get good at it unless this isnt your first time playing or your a gaming pro[spoiler]"
14286,"Fucking worst game i have ever played. Bullshit matchmaking. too much Pay2win shit. the gold payment costs too much. anything on here needs pay2win, tanks aren't balanced. russian tanks are too op, british tanks have too high penetration including too much rapid reload. no one uses team chat except for blaming the last guy alive. fucking take this game off and replace it with the original world of tanks (eventhough its as bullshit as blitz). i've done 123 hours on this game and my highest is the king tiger tank and i'm still getting more defeats rather than victories. to sum it all up, GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS WARGAMING AND FIX THIS BULLSHIT!!!!"
14287,"I don't give this game any money, almost everything in this game seems severely overpriced. That aside, this is a fun game to log into and do a few battles each day. After about a year of casual play I am still slowly working my way up the tech tree unlocking tanks and having a good time."
14288,This is just a mobile port.
14289,"World of tanks Blitz id=s a fun online multiplayer game. It involves tank v tank combat. It is a great game, but the rusian tanks need to be a bit balenced."

14291,Crap. Over 10sec to load a 75mm? Crap!
14292,It's a good game awesome graphics and high network durablity
14293,lages in moving
14294,such a cool game
14295,"Well if you want RNG fest, slow tanks and shady marketing..go for it. Only food thing about this game is that you can sealclub mobile players from pc and that it hasn't got arty."
14296,Really really like this game. I am addicted to it. But please remember to backup the original game folders before modding the game. I had to uninstall it because a modpack caused the game to crash
14297,"military honur rating based off of other players that have a poor sportmenship mantality.  i wouldnt recommend this game. based off of that. otherwise great game, very addictive. still want chat off option. like in wot, for blitz."
14298,World of Museum Tanks again
14299,"I have been playing this game on mobile since 2014 and it has gone in the wrong direction. 
1. OP premium tanks that are way too overpowered.
2.""fairy take tanks"" which are completely made up
3.One tier 8 premum tank will run you the same as a AAA game
4.Very little connection with the community
5.Doing changes to that nobody asked for
Before the game was really good, not it has gone really downhill. I would recommend the standart World of tanks rather than this joke."
14300,good
14301,The gamplay is great but the winning and losing coins thing is kind of worthless. i won a game and got 4 kills yet i lost 958 coins but when i lose i lose 75% of my coins. please fix this.
14302,Would like to see original World of Tanks on Steam.
14303,"I hate the Freemium feel of this game, makes me feel like I'm playing a cheap chinese spin-off of a real game on my low budget android cellphone even though I'm playing it on my PC while Ted Cruz is penetrating my unprotected tank-hole with his 18 inch propagandas, bounced on my boy's wiener to this one."
14304,"World of Tanks : Blitz is almost identical in mechanics to its PC and Console counterparts, but the textures have been scaled down, and the Stats have been modified to create a much faster-paced game. Simple 7-7 and matches last up to 10 minutes, rather than 15, but I higly doubt you will need all 10 minutes. 

Just a hint: If you play the PC version, and then play a few rounds in blitz the same way, you DOMINATE all competition. :)

only ONE thing that really makes me mad is that they are starting to create more and more disadvantages to the people who dont pay any money on the game. 

Personally, I made a purchase on the PC version, for the simple reason of there being no real disadvantage to not paying."
14305,"Get the regular version instead. Miles better. But it's not on Steam yet, sadly."
14306,Kill me pls
14307,"this is an ""ok"" game 6/10 id say... if you can stand grinding or have money play the game!"
14308,SO Nice  xD
14309,"Freaking awesome WW2 tank MMO. They have all sorts of tanks to include fantasy ones like the Glacial 112 (Chinese prototype heavy an actual tank) ,  T6 Dracula,  Blaze WZ,  and three tanks from Valkyrie Chronicles game.  Love the game,  though it upsets my wife when I play it lol."
14310,"As a seasoned WoT PC master race player, this game is more than expected as a backup when I travel (frequently). This game runs smoothly on my piece O' Crap HP Streambook with integrated Intel HD Graphics. Competition is as expected (garbage) until you get to tier IV."
14311,"Great game. At first I doubted that it would be fun, but it's super fun! I really enjoyed this game, and heck it's free."
14312,"not a good game to play world of tanks Blitz
i will play world of tanks"
14313,Very good game :)
14314,its fun and good i got 2 tier 10s 4 tier 9s and a lot of tier 8s its an action packet mobile tank game for everyone to play try it out!
14315,"Been playing this game for over 2000 hours on mobile and it is a joyless cash grab but free to play and not a pay to win at all. All the newbies will be complaining about other newbies and bad teams, and its the same in every game. What makes the game enjoyable is learning techneques and using them to your advantage to be at the top of your team, whether if u lose or not. Dont listen to all the 20 hour people complaining, because lower tiers are always gonna be plagued with seal clubbers(like me). Play it ,love it or hate it. If you always won, someone else will always lose.
Edit: Play minecraft"
14316,No artilery
14317,"As a long time player(i cant play WoT for some reason)i recommend this game but the developers are somewhat greedy. dont expect getting above tier 6 event premiums without spending money, But its a more balanced games than other games i've played. the grinding is somewhat half the original wot,its pretty fast because the time length is pretty much half the original and its low spec requirement allow it to be played at almost every pc. but its a mobile focused game though.
 
Edit1:the game isnt p2w,its pay if you want to."
14318,"Though, this game is nowhere near as good as it once was back in 2014-2015, I'd say its still a decent game as long as you can ignore the obvious milking of the mobile apps industry (cash grabs for appstore users)

First off, I'd reccomend PC WoT but the nice thing about blitz is its very easy to run, even the weakest of PCs can run this game fine, I have a core 2 duo e8400 and no dedicated graphics and i can play at low settings with 40-60 fps, for those who dont speak techy (which is weird since youre playing on a pc) i can play this game with a processor from 2005 and no dedicated graphics card. Any thing even remotely modern can easily run this game

Second off, its easier than the standard WoT, 7v7 means that if you even have 1/2 a brain and use some situational awareness you can have relatively easy success in battles

Finally, its just a fun game in general, its free, obviously theres gonna be micro transactions, but looking past that its a great way to pass time."
14319,"I haven't played this game in a while but I can say a few things:
The early game is fun, since there's basically no need to buy anything.
However, once you get further into the game, you need to do a lot of grinding, and to make it go faster you need a ""premium"" which you have to pay for. As well as that, tanks are sometimes unbalanced and the team matching system is unbalanced as well.
Should you get this game? No."
14320,World of Tanks Blitz is a great game worth hours of mindless fun.
14321,Its an ok game dont expect the full world of tanks game
14322,Good game to play if you don't much time to play or you don't want to download normal WOT. ^^
14323,no
14324,"it doesnt start for me,when it starts syncing it just shuts down,but apart from that it is a good game."
14325,A solid tank game.
14326,"Pure Moneygrab with extremely toxic community. In the last event (40k Tanks) it was not possible to obtain any of the promoted tanks without spending real money (the maximum achievable amount of tokens was not even close to the needed amount).

14327,recommend for low end pc
14328,"So ive had World of Tanks Blitz on pc for about a year now,and in my opionion its one of the best free games out there! I also had Blitz on my tablet a few years back and i loved it,and i still do! Its a really good game for what it is,a free and fun multiplayer tank game! 10/10."

14335,The World Of Tanks game (original verison) is more better than this one but i prefer to play this to practice and have fun. THIS GAME IS SO FUN I AM ADDICTED
14336,"It's a good game, but people get too salty too fast. It's considered camping if you use a TD for it's actual purpose. And half the time when some event comes along, people just buy the tanks and don't work for them. And the people that work for them, get cut off when the event ends. To top it off, some people act like they control the entire team, so when they die, it's everyone else's fault (Give or Take). It's better just playing World Of Tanks instead of this. It's fun, but sometimes it's just bullshit."
14337,traps aren't gay
14338,"Now can be played on PC, not only mobile phone. Cool."
14339,"Not the best game , but i like it."
14340,I love this game. You can spend hours playing this game and its free!
14341,The update is too bad it's not working now ...
14342,world of tanks ued to b fun and uncluttered with progam garbage but now the game has been comercialized so much  it is  out of control conforming I think to  tech gear up dates which makes it  impossible for  normal game play for people that DON'T have the most up to date gear  and tech.... this is progress but i played on a friends computer gear was  up to date  and it was not much better so that  being said the problem is at wargaming  i will NOT  be  useing money  on this game  till it straightens out again it's OS so it runs smoother i will be playing other games till then  cya like tank force another euro tank game that is  good to  play

14344,"They definitely know how to milk money, chuck in a mobile game on a pc platform so the little kids with their potato pc can run it and ask their mum to buy gold coins for their birthday.

IT'S NOT IN MY LIBRARY

14348,WOTB is wot except the games are shorter and it’s 7 a side and no artillery involved playing on pc probably better than on mobile as its auto aim is easier to use
14349,"A well made game. Graphics are great, in-game purchases are amazing. Gameplay is really good as well. I totally recommend getting World of Tanks Blitz.   I will be addicting after a few minutes of playing and after looking at the in-game purchases"
14350,Was hoping for a 40k tank. not even close. The game graghics are lucky to be 1990 generation. To me one of the worst games played in a while.
14351,"This game was fun at first, then it was boring and then just annoying because at like 6 hours you start to notice the balancing problems. If you want to play a free Tank game set in WWII play War Thunder."
14352,"The game matching is still poor. It would be nice if they had better games stats on a rolling average. Takes forever to move up, easier to go down. They should let you platoon with more than one other member. Too often you get YOLOs who get knocked out in 20 seconds."
14353,best game ever
14354,not a bad game 9/10 for game 1/10 awesome
14355,this game is so screwed up that where PC players can outplay Mobile Players
14356,Good! fun to play! :)
14357,"good
"
14358,It's ok considering it's a mobile port lol
14359,"I really enjoyed it myself.Would I recomand it?Yes.

I can see its not for everybody but give it a try,especially if you like Tanks alot.

Is there a pay to win aspect?
Yes and No  because for certain tanks you can only pay toget them but unless you want every single tank ever,you are perfectly fine with the normal ones you get in the game,it doesnt give you a disadvantage,it just means they got more fancy tanks to play with.

Balance?
I give it a 8-10
There is alot of diversity between alot of tanks and some are alittle too good and others are ... lets just say hard to play with.Dont worry if you play your cards right you can be in a significant position on your team.

They are the two main points covered.Personal tip.The tutorial and tips it gives is very vague.After finishing the tutorial and a few games online go to youtube and watch some WOTB guides and stuff  .I went to the Yolo gun blazing
,dies alot and learn things the hard way.It was painful but fun.The youtube videos would have help honestly.I wish I did sooner.  

Hope this helps and see ya on the battlefield ;3"
14360," TERRIBLE GAME ! horrific gfx , terribad controls and the grind is just retarded level"

14366,i love it!
14367,"A ridiculous game that prizes itself on completely unbalanced teams. There seems to be no discrimination towards experience and vehicle strength. Example, I've seen one player slug six shells into an opponent only for the oppenent to turn around and one shot them. So naturally a complete noob like myself would just be toyed with on EVERY battle field. There are steep learning curves and then there is just utter insult to injury. Just another clear example of how FTP is just PTW."

14372,"параша ебаная Kappa

"
14373,Pretty good for casual game but if you want a good tank game get War Thunder
14374,"I would say that this game changed a lot since 2017, It went good direction to have lots of loot gaining during the game
Its pretty easy to get premium account due to lots of events, passes. Prices of the stuff is hella cheaper compared to before.

this game slowly becomes viable for f2p users as you dont have to buy anything for real money, unless its 3000 gold for 0.99e i managed to buy ><

Its still very worth it

I know that this game has fantasy tanks, but you can counter them actually"
14375,Very fun I totally recommend it!
14376,Keep SNIPING !!! :v
14377,"Yes, it is a mobile game on PC AND the PC game isnt on steam BUT...

This game is still pretty fun for me. Probably coz I just love tanks."
14378,"I wish this was a proper paid-for game, rather than a pay-to-win (though it's hardly even that, more pay-to-have-an-even-chance) free-to-play game.

Horribly grindy, with innumerable predatory payment plans constantly being rammed down your throat.

It's such a shame, because under all the horrifying framework there is a solid and enjoyable core game. It handles well, looks good and is fun to play."
14379,"its a decent game that receives a lot of criticism because of its ""paid to win"" approach. What more can you expect from a free to play game? War Gaming is  a business, you need to remember that, their aim is to make a profit for themselves so that they can live their personal lives and expand the game further. People buying god packs or premium tanks pay so that they can enjoy their good tanks, of course War Gaming needs to give those said tanks a slight advantage over other normal tanks. DUH!!! However, if you think about it, most premium vehicles have pretty serious issues and if you are smart, you would find ways to counter them.

KV-5: its slow with good frontal armour, flank around and hit is from sides or rear. If you are a heavy, hit its obvious and big machine gun post.

Su-100Y: big tank with little camoflaughe capabilities, its armour is pretty weak as well, it has a big gun, thats all.

IS-6: good all around tank, but bad ROF

E25: bad base damage so a peek a boom method will suffice.\

T54-Mod 1: good armour, but pretty bad top speed and penetration level for its tier.

and so on, you will see that there are pretty obvious weaknesses, if you are a good player, you will learn to exploit these weaknesses.

Overall, i dont encounter cheaters at all, pretty rare if you do find one. There is a problem with AFK's though, so if WargGaming remedies that problem, it will be a good game. Overall, don't hate so much on Wargaming, they did a decent job developing this game and I will give the props to them. Come at me haters

thanks for reading my review and have a nice day, constructive criticism can be usefull"
14380,love the game
14381,"First off, let me show pros and cons in a fair review; then I'll explain why the whole ""downvote"" thing.

Cons:

 - Opressive microtransaction system. (Seriously, you can't even 'breathe' without them getting all up into your grill about spending $$$. You cannot even resupply ammo without having to keep a careful eye on the gold button....)

 - Unbalanced sortie (Some of the tanks are unfairly over-armored, lacking sufficient drawbacks to make them fair and balanced. Also, there's obvious bias towards and in favor of american and swedish tanks, whereas the japanese tanks lack even half as much love and consideration...)

 - All that glitters is definitely gold (The ""good tanks"" can only be gained by being purchased with real world money, or by purchasing crates in order to reduce the grind. Otherwise, yer gonna be growing grey hairs before you get that Maus. Additionally, tanks that you buy with $$$ are pre-equipped with max-tier gear, and give you bonus credits with every victory. Pay-to-win, anyone...?)

 - Moderately poor mapmaking (A lot of maps have subtle advantages to one side or the other, making most matches against the favored side a dicey situation at best....Also, placement of concealing terrain is in such stupid places, no one would ever 'actually' wanna hide there, rather than just relying on camo to hide in plain sight.)

 - Magical camo of vanishing (Enemies vanish into thin air if your view range isn't sufficient, even if they're in plain sight. Not even camo can excuse this, guys! Come on now. I'm sure you can do better than that.)

 - Limited maps (Seriously. You'll be fighting in the same couple of maps several dozen times before finding the miniscule number of more advanced maps which are more or less the same thing....)

 - Bad community event organizing (For example; The Mcragge's thunder event was designed with the full intent of it being a month-long event. HOWEVER; Steam users only got informed of it once there was ONLY A WEEKS WORTH OF TIME LEFT. Thus making it impossible to succeed without chunking in a hundred dollars to get two tanks. ONE HUNDRED. DOLLARS. Let that sink in for a moment.)

 - Intentionally-hobbled revenue gains (Unless, of course, you wanna pay a hundred dollars a year to renew yer premium subscription, in which case it doesn't matter HOW much you suck, cuz you'll feel like a winner 24/7. They know full well that credits are earned agonizingly slow; that's why, for just 20$, you can 'enrich' a tank, causing it to recieve bonus credits for every battle. Rrriiiight....)


Pros:

 - Fun timesink (Seriously though; it is an incredibly fun way to spend yer time while, say, waiting for a dentist appointment, or while waiting for an update to install, or whatever. While waiting for something more important to happen, it's always fun to just kick back an' blow stuff up.)

 - Easy to learn, easy to play (The controls are VERY simple. even a 3rd grader can to really well.)

 - Simple rules and simple maps (You can develop strategies in seconds of glancing at the map. Also, it's basically JUST capturing control points or deathmatch. There's literally no other objectives or game modes. Just a mashup of KOTH meets deathmatch, or a mashup of 3-hill KOTH...with deathmatch.)

 - Low specs (It can run on a modern phone. So obviously it's got low spec requirements. Perfect for people who wanna play world of tanks, but lack the specs to play the real deal. It's also okay to run a buncha background programs as well. I've run a full scan with windows defender, and had a web browser open with a youtube video playing in one tab and a social media site open on another tab, and yet not even a single frame of lag was detected.)

 - Nice looking maps (Beautifully scenic. Ya know, considering. It's like TF2 level graphics here. Almost.)

 - Really pretty tankies (The tanks are usually very nice looking. Except for a few problems here and there... *coughcoughthewholebottomflooroftheMarderIIismissingcoughcough*)


Ultimately, I rate this game with a 4 out of 10, below average. Bearing in mind that it's free-to-try-to-play, AND that it's a cell phone game, those two facts have cut it some slack. It would've been a 2 of 10, if not for those two reasons. Sure, the graphics are real pretty, but in the end, all this game is is just a pathetic excuse for a cash grab. And after playing world of tanks blitz, I have reconsidered buying world of tanks original, and will instead chunk that money into TF2 cosmetics. Heck knows a hat that doesn't do anything but glow and shine is a much better use of the money. xD"
14382,Fun
14383,very good game

14386,Love It!!! :)
14387,"Good fun, but arcade like 
But free 😊"
14388,"Far from the detail and quality of the original World of Tanks, but certainly enough for some fun. Game is developing mostly in positive ways. However, In game chats are rude sometimes (especially if you don't know how to play... so avoid it then)."
14389,STOP THE GRIND
14390,Another mobile crap port game on steam. Go play War thunder instead.
14391,5300+ hours in this game and still counting. Waiting the time I could recommend this game.
14392,"One team is green,      
second is red.
This game is bad,
so why I paid for that?
          
- physics, community, unfriendly players
+ platoon, training battles
 The worst thing is you have to pay for repairing your vehicle after training battle.
"
14393,"This game is just a dumbed down version of Wargaming's other game. 
Therefor I do not recommend it."
14394,"If you want to play tank games on steam, play War Thunder."
14395,"Beware ye who is a fan of world of tanks. This is a not a mobile world of tanks, No matter what it says on the tin it is only simular in concept and lacks the spirit of its pc and console peers. Everything from equipment to camoflauge has a mobile pay for everything spin on it. you cant just buy equipment. you need to unlock the slots with spare parts which you can only gain through daily tasks(of which you can only do three a day without paying gold) and ontop of that it takes up to 24 hours to unlock a slot(which can be accelerated with gold), you can instantly research every module on a tank for gold. and you can use gold to turn a normal tank into a premium tank(via the benifits such as increased credit earning) there are daily crates you can open for free. but only three a day of the standard. every two days for the big. and once a week for the huge. extra of the big and huge crates can be bought with gold at 300 and 600 respectivly. there are ""rare"" camo's you can unlock for gold(notice a trend here?) ontop of standard world of tanks uses for the currency. One thing i do like is the ability to earn commendations that allow you to earn a type of booster that grants you 1 - 24 hours of premium time for free through missions."
14396,"After 5 years of mobile play getting to KV-4, realises you can play on PC."

PAY TO WIN. Have fun."
14400,so stupid of a game loss 8 times in a row cant get any dmg on taks even from behind and im tierd out as fuck fix your shit so its fair and dont make games for money faggits make it legit thank you and fuck off
14401,game for the warhammer 40k event left cause of how much play time id have to put in to play with the warhammer tanks im talking days and or spending like 100 bucks to just get them what a scam
14402,"Pay to win, only way to get the Warhammer tanks is pay over hundreds of pounds to get them then and there, you'll be grinding for days if you try to do the tasks and even then is all that wasted time worth it. Hell no."
14403,"still the standad grind fest of world of tanks, i dont want to play 10000+ games with tanks i dont like to get a tank I might enjoy!"
14404,"I will change this review when you make obtaining the ultra marine emblems to aquire the warhammer tanks even semi possible without spending gold. You would currently need to win something like 50 games daily to even have a chance, and thats with premium status. Please change this, or gift us emblems."
14405,Very good game but you can kinda ragequit.
14406,"download to get the wargammer tank. only to find out it's either pay to win, or one of the game that need most grinding i ever encountered. 75win per day and do it for 10 days....i can't even do 75 win in 10 days when half of the tanks are premieum tanks, while other half of the time i am at the lowest tier where i can't even hurt the butt of the other players, knowing all the weakspot for I am at tier 9 on PC WOT.

wargamming just going a downward spiral since they try to block and censor those negative comment on their pay to win MMO since last year. I deeply regret paying gold to this company who don't make it better but just greedier. Never will i pay for anything under wargaming again.

14413,"I got drawn into playing by the Warhammer 40k event. Turns out it's too much of a grind, and sadly the gameplay is too poor to keep me for the sake of fun. The ""World of"" franchise has aged very poorly. As it stands, War Thunder offers tank battles that are basically better in every way."
14414,"its fucking shit
"
14415,its ok
14416,Nice game !
14417,"Pay 2 win trash, don't annoy yourself playing it"
14418,yo mama so fat that she made WOT blizt so unbalanced
14419,"i tried the game to play with  the warhammer 40k tanks but if you dont pay money or play nonstop this is not going to happen. this is a crap mobile version of World of Tanks and it is beyond me why they wouldnt put it in the ""original"" WoT."
14420,Average la
14421,"This game isn't even fun when you have players pouring into P2W tanks. At least in War Thunder you were staged with optimal Tiers. This game is like for masochists who love to get their asses handed to by a Tank Destroyer or Medium Tank. While as a newbie running with a light tank.

14422,pay to win fuck fuck dick fuck (slow retated CS:GO)
14423,Lured by a WH40K event where you actually have to grind to have the chance to play with the Emperor's finest machines...
14424,My shots didn't ever penetrate the enemy tanks. My team always got wiped out. Do I have to pay to win?
14425,"This is a greedy cashgrab, the greedy and arrogant developers have absolutely no idea what balance is. Only gold pay-2-win tanks get good match making and RNG, the free-2-play players are constantly penalised with missed shots, bad RNG, very bad bot or AFK team mates. Developers constantly ignore good suggestions from broad community. They only listen to 2% of top pay-2-win who constantly give biased feedback and refuse to acknowledge gold tanks are OverPowered cos they will be buying those same tanks and get easy victories. Developer intentionally deceives players, to cite an example, developer said they are removing tech tree tier 1 to tier 4 tanks to make it less confusing for new players, then turned around volte face and started SELLING those same removed tanks for real $$. Gambling is actively encouraged, especially to minors, with a clearly rigged and manipulated reward system favoring pay-2-win over F2P. Irrelevant features like avatars and attachments are sold, focus is on adding graphics rather than improving core gameplay.

TLDR : This is a russian developer, no morals, no ethics, no balance, only pay-2-win mechanics. AVOID like the plague"
14426,Ya
14427,"The review is after playing this game more than a year.This game is basically pay to win game.Although it is addictive that is why i played it for more than a year but the reason why i dont like this game is that it lets u win if u spend ur hard earned money in the game.And also i would like to  say that the servers are very trollish,they sometime give u good connectivity and sometimes doesnot even connect.It basically happens at the time of updates and also this game is very frustrating.Also   the game consists of  some tanks that dont even exists in real.In my opinion new players should stay away from this game as it becomes hard for them to understand how this games machinics work.Also the grinding in this game bullshit.instead look for some other multiplayer games."
14428,...  Play War Thunder
14429,"Fun game, also it is on steam so its the only WoT game I play."
14430,HA! 100 bucks for the new 40k tanks? ok don't have that kinda cash how about free time ... 75 matches a day for 10 days ? are you fucking kidding?
14431,GGWP
14432,you cant change the resolution of the game
14433,"Pros
- It's possible to unlock some cute, fun tanks that are from various franchises.
- The gameplay is... cute. It's much lighter than War Thunder and is far more arcade-y. It's good for if you want to take a mental vacation from other tank games.

Cons
- It's inferior to War Thunder and the original World of Tanks.
- The community is more toxic than an Olympic swimming pool filled with botulinum. I mean it's expected at a competitive game aimed for children and teens, but that's still a factor to consider. Don't be surprised if you have Vietnam flashbacks from your time playing League of Legends though.
- The game tries way too hard to get your money, but considering the gameplay and community it's not really worthwhile to invest a dime into this game.
- With all the flashy confetti, bright colors, visual effects, etc. It feels a lot more like it's aimed a children, when you combine that with the micro-transactions and gambling element of containers that's pretty disgusting."
14434,"This is just a shooter but instead of a guy you have a tank. It's also arena combat, so forget strategy, there is none.

The game is designed to encourage..err... almost force you to spend your hard earn real life cash. This is an archaic form of game that dies out very fast as people get sick of the greedy nature of the game designers and publisher. Look at League of Legend and Guild Wars, they do not have a crappy system that ""forces"" you to spend money, they give you the opportunity to buy stuff you like. For example, you have experience and ""free"" experience instead of having just one experience pool but you gain less, and to convert experience into ""free"" experience, you need to spend real life money for something that should already be part of the game (like you can convert 5 to 1 normal experience to free experience). I really hope nobody uses these scamming ""services""... unless they like getting screwed.

Some tanks are ranked higher than they should and ends up being totally useless on the battle field, especially unresearched (Like Pz2, all American Tanks level 2 to 4, etc.). They have some serious balancing isssues to fix.

The game designers are ignorant of WWII tanks. For example, there were no Pzkw-IVa or b in action at all in WWII, yet the designers put that one in the game which makes no sense since they are bad tanks.

Games are short 5-10 min.

Good part is that if your tank is destroyed, you can go back to your garage and pick another fight.

There are some major flaws in the game :
- Slope armour is not taken into account . Which is dumb because it was a major factor in the German-Russian war with the T-34. Hetzer, Panther, Jagd Pather and other tanks using slope armour are highly underevaluated. They do not seem to understand that sloped armour like doubles its efficiency.
- They mix tanks categories which leads to no damage done for the lighter tanks to the heavier tanks. This is especially true for light tanks. The light tanks should only fight light tanks.
- They mix eras. A 1939 tank would have no chance against a 1944-45 tank. Hetzer would be practically invulnerable to 1939 tanks, yet it is mixed with such tanks. And this happens in the game. I use a Pz II Luchs and it cannot harm anyone so I do not get any experience to get a better gun due to this stupidity. There should be two types of arenas, mixed and scaled+historical. That way, light tanks would not fight medium and heavy tanks. No way a Pz 2 or a T-24 can harm a heavy and even less a super heavy tank. Hetzers are so underevaluated. It was capable of rolling at 42 km/h which is nice considering the tanks that it was pitted against.
- Shooting in the butt of a tank should do serious damage when there is penetration, but in this game, you just lose hps. Lame. If you are very lucky, you do some special effect like ingniting the fuel reserves or something. It happens not enough time to be important not to expose the back of your tank and people just move however they please. Sure, you lose more hps but it is not that serious.
- Makes me laugh when I see a Stug having more protection than late war machines like the Hetzer or as much as the Jagd Panther. haha! Makes completely no sense.
- Some tanks are supposed to be fast like the Hetzer... yes him again. lol
- Oh! And StuG are better than late war weapons like the Hetzer and T-34. lol
- Pzkw-IVa and b were more a training units and prototypes and practically saw no action. The Pzkw-IVc was the main support tank of the German Reich in 1939. The Pzfw-IVc to Pzkw-IVf used short barrels making them useless at long range and very imprecise, which is not the case in this game since you can snipe someone far away with an untrained crew on top of that and hit 80% of the time... hahaha! Stupid game and lame game designers that did not do their research properly. There were only 35 Pzkw-IVa produced in the entire world in history. There were practically no Pzkw-IVb produced. Pzkw-IVc was the one mass produced. Only the Pzkw-IVf2 was equiped with a long barrel gun which then changed the way the Pzkw-IV was used resulting in very interesting designs afterwards. But in this game that designers know nothing about WWII, the Pzkw-IVa is a main battle tank. hahaha! And the tank sucks royally and should be replaced like in real life with the Pzkw-IVc!
- Point Blank shot in the butt of a super light tank with a 75mm AP shell and it does nothing? Perhaps in the front with slope armour, but in the back? A flat back on top of that? Go back to school designers, your game is super dumb and proves your ignorance.


I know they are trying to make tank platoons, but at the very least, categorize the tanks per year dont put early war tanks with late war tanks, none of those were used and they would have had no chance with 1944-45 technology.

All in all I don't recommand this game since it's just another arena shooter that brings nothing new to the genre. There are thousands of those that have appeared since the 1990s. It is also a pay to win but you can play for a long time for free like League of Legends for example. If you are in no hurry, you can progres slowly and avoid premium accounts who doubles your xps.

Prices are hilarious. They ask more money than big games like World of Warcraft or other MMOs. With the price they are asking, you can buy six good games on Steam for the same price. lol

Also, unlike League of Legends, I doubt I will play years of this game.

Do not play this if you play Unreal or some other great shooter already, really not worth your time."
14435,"""Dont waste your download time!""

This game feels cheap, looks cheap and plays cheap! It could originally of been developed as a mobile game.

0/10"
14436,"""New"" players are railroaded too much. I'm already familiar with the game as I played the original version under a different email but had no way to link the two."
14437,"I have this game for my mobile and its really fun, on pc not so much. Its a much more simplified version of World of Tanks ported to PC so others could enjoy it? But its not that fun as you would think once you see the controls looks like it was made for children pretty much..

Fun on mobile when your away from home, not so much when its on pc.

Old review: Its like the mobile version, exept its less fun."
14438,"This game is Shit. Pure and simple like that.
The grind is completely unrewarding, some tanks are OP for their tier and you cannot feasibly advance without paying for gold at least once.

DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME, IT IS A CANCER."
14439,"game was nice back in the days. no OP tanks for pay-to-win players, no game breaking meta,less bad mechanics. the clan tournament system sucks now, same with missions and players in game , Matchmaking makes a random advantages/disadvantages to teams and so you won´t be surprised why the match ended like that after you look on players in your and theirs team.

3,5/10 overall"
14440,A simplfied version of world of tanks that offers NO guidance on what tanks suit which playstyles aside from some quick blurb text on your first pick. Playing the game effectively requires knowledge of the tanks and their types which requires a lot of research OUTSIDE the game. The tutorial is highly restrictive and the match maker that can best be described as MEDIOCRE. Everything UI and gameplay related reeks of tablet game. I'd rather play War Thunder and that game is no gem.
14441,"old graphic , the gameplay kinda boring and slow.  i belive there is better free to play game to enjoy"
14442,"All Wargaming.net and War Thunder style games have become a terrible grind and are getting worst.
As long as players keep paying more and more the more likely you will be required to pay.
I stopped playing all grinding style games PERIOD.

NOT RECOMMENDED.
"
14443,"i haven't played it much , but this game is just great , controls are a BIT fiddle dee fiddle doo but you can master them if you play enough , graphics are decent for what it is and the servers are very good . now onto the content , if you are a noob scrublord you'll find this game VERY hard in the aspect of progression, but if you are a a bit more hardcore then you'll find the grind totally worth it ,there's something for almost everyone in the Mechanised roster under your command (kinda) . there's the lights , mediums , heavies and tank destroyers . you will mostly keep playing until you find the perfect class-tank for you , as for tiers , you'll Steamroll through Tiers I-IV with little to no effort , simply mess around with those miniscule , slow , poorly armed ""Tanks"" until you find yourself in Tier IV , you'll definetly find tier IV a stretch , you will grind ALOT for tier V , but it's worth it when you get to the REAL competetion . 

as for the P2W terming this game recieves ? BS 
you can get hours and hours of VIP for F R E E 
i have around 16 1-hour vip certificates from the free crates that i paid NOTHING for , and that's the only thing that gives others an advantage of doubled earnings just to make the grind shorter  which in no way affects your or other's gameplay experience 

Overall , it's a very good game and the gameplay is fantastic , The Multi-nation spectrum of tanks is guranteed to give you something that you like , would recommend it if your pc can't Run the original WOT , otherwise get that since it's the big developed pubescent brother of this game

Edit: The game is starting to fall down the p2w hole these days, will update."

This game used to be fun with all the good players the nice community nice tank 
But now micro transactions is basically required to play this game (remember the dracula tank sh*t ?) 
All the overpowered tank that u will never gonna get without paying a lot of money in it)
The high tier tanks took way too much money to repair and resupply after each match compare to the very tiny amount of money you get (even u won that match but get lots of damage) 
>hackers cough cough....
And again it takes too much experience just to be able to buy a tank (but money can make it done in seconds)"

Even though a lot of people say it is a pay to win I think that you can get to the same place and have the same amount of fun without paying. I haven't bought anything (except for the FCM when if first came out), currently have three tier X tanks and the game is great."

this is actually one of my faverate games, i've played 5 years and am a very good player
winrate is 53% and average damage is 2k, working to get that 60% winrate ;)
to anyone thinking of downloading this game, it's amazing grapics and solid coding allow players with ether sh!t computers or phones to be able to play this amazing game without having to deal with 20 fps. one thing though new players need to consider how good they are at the game before they go buying tier VIII premiums because there are a ton of players up there not knowing what they are doing and ruining the game for pros like me and many other people so try to at least improve your skills before going to higher tiers."

14480,Best tank game I have ever played. Fairly good graphics and overall good quality.
14481,"it helps to think that this isnt just a run and shoot with pay to win tanks although u can pay to win :P. but nonetheless u are matched with tanks of ur level and u can climb the ranks. the game isnt your average Joe, it needs strategy teamwork and a hell lot of tactics, i mean some shells just dont do damage on other tanks and the other shells need more time to reload and ur in a tight spot and this is a common situation where you have many utilitied to go with, in addition the shooting isnt easy and requires some physics to comprehend how it works, and the traction, urghhh, for god's sake understand that you cant climb a 90 degrees wall, ur not a tank, oh wait u are :P, u still cant tho."
14482,"Really enjoy this game, already got quite a few hours. Very playable without in app purchases, and certainly the best free game I've played."
14483,"Ok firstly - I know I have 0 play time. I have been playing the game outside of steam for some time now. The game is great. Red ahead and Ill address the 'pay to win' responses this game gets. 

Overall review -

The game is great, given its entirely free to play. It brings to life tanks that only ever existed as prototypes or as blueprints which is cool to experience. I can guarantee you that you will jump into the game with a level of expectation only to find that it's much harder to play than first thought. You will quickly learn that strategy, teamwork and positioning all require twice as much understanding than you could have expected. You will jump in and power through the first few tiers of tanks as quick as you can only to discover that patience is key and that you should master each tank before moving onto the next.


Pay to win??:-

 You can advance just as far as paying players without paying a cent. It is in no way pay to win. People who describe this game as pay to win just lack the patience or dedication to actually pursue something further than whats 'easy'.

The paying aspect of this game is to buy gold and upgrade to a premium account for a specific amount of time. Special tanks can be purchased with gold but they can not be advanced or built upon. They are stuck in the class that they are designated and contribute nothing to your technology tree or you're personal skill. Premium accounts just earn you 1/3 more credits and experience each game and there's plenty of ways to obtain premium account status without paying. Paying does not make your tanks any stronger than the rest, it just helps you progress through the game quicker than if you hadn't paid and even then - paying players will still be matched with players with the same tier tanks."
14484,"I recommend this game to anyone who loves tanks. This is an amazing game and my favorite from Wargaming. I dont have that many hours on steam because i play either on the mobile phone or on windows. Let me know if any of you would like to platoon, or ""play"", together."
14485,"I've played this game a lot in the past. The gameplay is mediocre at best and wargaming (the company who made this game) don't care about their player base (ATGM tanks for example). They seem to only focus on the Russian playerbase. The only reason why I've sunk so many hours in this game is the players and clan members I made friends with. There is 20% of the players who are a joy to play with and the rest will make your blood boil. I can't say how many times this game has made me feel like raging because of the winrate and average damage stats placed on your profile. Other players will look down on you if you have a low winrate or average damage. This in turn caused me to aim to get a 60% winrate and average damage above 1500. I eventually did, however every game I played turned out to be far from enjoyable. There isn't much autobalance for the teams and sometimes you can be unlucky with new players or afk players causing your winrate to drop. All in all this game can be fun when played sparingly but after that it becomes a unenjoyable experience. 

A bit about my background in this game:
- I was a clan leader for a clan that ranked top 30 out of all clans in Asia back in 2019.
- I've played over 50 Clan tournaments."
14486,Did not realize this was the mobile version. Eeeeeewwwwwww!!!
14487,"This is the most cancer WG game ever, there is no logic and no skill in this version of the game ( tier 1 have more hp than tier 2 WTF fix thsi crap ) you give people 100% accurate indication on your penetration and where to shoot, you can just auto aim all the time because it is giving lead for some reason ( a bit ). the movement is bugged as hell you can't do something fast or it will jam and you wont be abble to move and you,ll keep getting shot. Dont even try it, this is soooo bad"
14488,"I would recommend this game a lot, it is fun and action packed. My only issue is when your in a tier 4 light tank for example, and then the game puts you in against a tier 5 heavy tank. How the hell am i going to win??? and I once had a time when i was in a tier 5 heavy, against another tier 5 heavy, and It took me about 20 shells to kill him, but that same tank killed me in one hit, how does that work???? And basically all the time, i would drive forward by holding down the W key, but my tank wouldn't move. then about 10 seconds later my tank would start moving and it wouldn't stop. it's the same with my steering, i tap the A key for 2 seconds and then my tank would drive in circles constantly. This game is great but It  has it's issues."
14489,Cool  game
14490,"Yeah it may be a mobile game adapted for PC, and if you have a halfway decent PC you could probably just play the actual WoT, (and I do) but this game is actually fun. It's obviously smaller, 7 vs 7 instead of 15 vs 15, but that means the matches are shorter and it's easier to carry a game. 

The tier spread is only one up or down, so that's good. It's much more arcady than WoT. The difference in realism is kind of like the difference between WoT and War Thunder. The armor is color coded in sniper mode so you can tell where you will penetrate and where you won't, the UI is more arcade like, etc.

One thing I don't like is all the weird fake tanks. Like the T6 Dracula and the Helsing, they're weird. The Tankenstein is kind of funny though. 

Bottom line, it's free. Try it. If you don't like it, don't bother whining. It was free. Unless you spend money in game before you decide you like it. That's dumb."
14491,Fun game
14492,a good arcade tank shoot'em up
14493,"This game is Very bad compeared to the real world of tanks, This is ok for mobile but i don't understand why they did not also add the full game to steam and make this a optional download for players that want to play on mobile or tablets."

14498,"its fun, if there is no gold involved.. devs don't care about their costumers.. this is basicly a cheat because your playing against mobile users.. so PC wins. and if you play the normal world of tanks that is build for PC.. expect some cheats.. don't believe me? google it, ive tested them all myself.. overpowered and devs don't do shit about it"
14499,"You know guys, a little update to this review. Just nevermind everything said about the attention to community. It seems that WG can actually makke the projects, that are playable and good only for first few years. Fuck it.

Sooo... Since the very beginning of the ""World of..."" WG series I was with them. Or almost since the very beginning. Imagine my amusement when I've heard the same good old tanks are coming to mobile. It was a bit later when everyone (including me) started hating PC version because of $h¡tt¥ updates WG made. But Blitz version has everything we loved in its ""big brother"" and with updates it's becoming better and better. Yeah, it's still not perfect in some terms and, yeah, T49 and KV-2 are goddamn annoying sometimes, but man, Blitz team reacts to community claims and that's freaking great. And yeah, playing with KB+mouse is much easier and much more comfortable."

14508,OP while playing on PC
14509,"RNG and stupid viewrange, detection rules."
14510,"As I have played over 3K hours most likely on World Of Tanks PC (27K battles), I recommend this if you have either a potato PC, a Laptop, or want to play ""on the go"" in your tablet/smartphone.

Do note that your account on PC, doesn't matter cause this is an entirely different game with new tanks (but also missing some compared to consoles/PC), new maps etc etc, so there is that, if you are a veteran and want to join, you will have to start all over again unfortunately. But you can indeed, have the same Wargaming account.

You can also play with your buddies who play on android, which is cool!

It's definetely fun, the lack of artillery compared to World of Tanks PC is a blessing and the premium rounds doing less damage is a good change as well. Things like that, coming from a PC player, are nice to have, especially not having to have a 100% crew on every damn tank. What a time to be alive!

Honestly, sometimes I'm thinking I should be playing this instead. That says something for sure.

It's a solid would not pay for an OP premium on PC/10."
14511,"After editing my review I got a lot more critical, since blitz is starting to look more and more like the WoT on PC I deliberately stopped playing. Wargaming is trying harder and harder to tempt players with absurd tanks that haven't even existed in real time or are so proposterous that I simply shrug and wonder what kind of game this is becoming. 
It's kind of a fun game, but the ads of overpowered pay to win tanks is increasing at an alarming rate. In turn reducing the game's fun exponentially. 
I only recommed this to play together with friends OR in the training rooms which don't cost anything. Don't expect anything big. It's just another pay2win game.

Edit: Wargaming, the maker of this game, is all about money. Events, new tanks, rewards. It's all about the player buying gold or spending real money in this game. Big Dislike."
14512,"If this Sh** can run in my potato in 60fps, you sure can run it. 

No, really, this runs in almost every pc, and if you dont get at least 30fps, try burning your pc and purchasing another one.

Besides of that, its kinda interesting game, its not too good but you know, not a piece of trash either. Why is not goood?
-Kind of Pay-To-Win (To advance in the game faster and to get premium tanks, which are kind of stronger than normal ones)
-Whenever you end a match, do not expect to get credits from it, instead, you should be prepare to loose them with every match (Its not like the credits are hard to get, but it can get annoying to loose credits even after a win)
-Althrough it finds a match in a matter of seconds, there are not too many players online. Just like some thousands on each server.
-If you like to spend money in games (I havent spent a single cent, though), do not spend on this one. Gold (In-game currency used to get almost everything faster and ""better"") is REALLY expensive and after all it doesnt worth it.
-Only one gamemode, and you only have one life. (Havent played on rating matches but i think its the same)
-Matilda. (Heavy british tank, tier 4, almost invulnerable)
Some of the good points of this game are:
-You can get gold (And with that, premium account) for free, you just have to get lucky with the containers.
-Even if P2P (Pay to play) players have advantage, that doesnt grants them a secured victory, and you feel good when you make them cry in the global chat when you beat them.
-A good, solid gameplay (Ignoring the cost on everything, even the ammo) and if you like tanks from WW 1 and 2 then this is for you.
-It's really fun to play it.

I can recommend this game, but also warn you that if you dont like it at the start, you wont like it on any point. Its ""free"", so you can try it and see."
14513,"It is kind of sad because the original idea in this was ONLY WWII era tanks when the game was released on mobile devices, but the developers ruined it.
Nowadays the game has fictional tanks which are overpowered and of course cost money to get.
Only good thing in this in my opinion is daily free rewards so grinding is not so painful.

I suggest you to get the actual PC version (better physics, graphics etc.) from [url=eu.wargaming.net]Wargaming's official website[/url] rather than this, unless you have potato toaster, which can't run anything with fancy graphics.

Afterall, this game is pretty fun in 1-6, 9 and 10 tiers but the 7 and 8 are filled with the fictional tanks."

14519,one of my best  games  full action  nice upgrates  no cheats no hacks
14520,TOP!
14521,"Many people who struggle to understand the core concepts of this game would be inclined to tell you that it's pay to win (to of course diminish the fact that their profound lack of skill is not due to a lack of will or endeavor but that it is impossible to succeed in this game) but this is untrue. The very things that they complain about and term ""pay to win"" are accessible to everyone from the very beginning of the game, provided you allocate your earnings correctly and understand how the game works. The learning curve is quite steep, so this is probably the reason for many quitting and terming this a P2W; the only thing that can be bought for real money that one could term ""necessary"" is the premium system, wherein you earn 50% additional credits and experience (the primary tools of progression) so long as it is activated. This provides absoultely no in-game assistance, but is merely a convienence tool to boost progression (I myself use it as a full time student also working full time with generally only 5 or so hours a week to play the game). Any other core content can be earned. If the childish playerbase took the time to learn the game, understand the fundaental mechanics, they would see the fruit of the game design and enjoy it: the primary antithesis of this is the same as all multiplayer games - the community is short tempered and have a severe misunderstanding of the game. If this game piques your interest, certainly try and learn more before hopping into play, it will give you a significant advantage over those who chose to remain in ignorance out of self pity and lack of responsibility."
14522,"This Game is Good, You Basically Know What it is all About.
Battle Grind Upgrade Unlock, Repeat. But i enjoyed Playing it unless the game loses its charm so fast i got bore real Soon. As Always This game is for Specific Playerbase so give it a try and find out."
14523,smoth and entretaining tanks fun...i aprove
14524,this game sucks. its tutorial sucks. its tanks suck. the tutorial itself takes more than 40 mins. itni der me to me pro hi ho jaata. chutiyo
14525,"Very much fun to play! Thanks to no premium consumables and lower damage of premium shells (no pay to win) it is a very ballanced gameplay! But only persons who are bad in this game are writing reviews so game is underrated. 

WoT Blitz is the evolutionary edition of Wot cause its better matchmaking, free Lootboxes, better Premium shells, better Skill system, better maps (closer), less match time, better gamemodes (no 2 bases mode!), better Skin system, better Ranked matches (because of tier IX also) and other more things.

Thank you very much Wargaming for this game after I stopped WoT for p2w reasons!

For more infos comment me at my profile!"
14526,"Terrible Graphics, super idiot teammates...

Played a couple hours, most matches results is 5/7 teammates causing 0 damage in the whole time.

Maybe replace most noobs with AI Players will make the experience better seriously..."
14527,"Il Matchmaking fa cagare, e con questo ho detto tutto"
14528,Really much better if u play on PC compared to mobile but if u use mods it'll sometimes crash after an update so best to have backups of original files
14529,"This is kind of a long review i have some stuff to say about this game.

This game could be so much better if the game was not pay to win, Its fun at first with tier 1 and 2 but when you start getting into higher levels, you start meeting more and more players who have spent money on the game, witch is not a bad thing to do, You know game devs need money right xD But unfortunately people are spending money for all the wrong reasons like:    

( premium consumables, ammo and even tanks ) 

This makes the game unbalanced and a pain in the ass to play xD
 If they removed all pay to win mechanics
And added cosmetic items that do not change gameplay like:  

 (Tank skins) 

I think it would be a better gaming experience
and alot more fun to play. 

I also think match making needs alot of work. 
As joining a match and finding out the other team as 5 premium tanks its just a night mare.
and theres alo.....  oh who even cares the game devs are not going to listen, Its there business model, Its not a good one but Its how they make money. 

So i would just give it a miss if you dont like pay to win mechanics in video games. 


"
14530,I give this game the finger...RNG aiming?.... P2W
14531,"It's a very addictive and immersive game. It requires strategic thinking and pre-planning. Gameplay is relatively well balanced. It would be better if you could enable better graphics on Win10 versions, similar to the PC version."
14532,Would recommend
14533,"I reccomend war thunder, where you do not have to spend $100 on a DIGITAL TANK"
14534,Too arcade-like for my tastes. I prefer War Thunder which delivers a more immersive experience and planes.
14535,"Winning seems to be based either on chance or spending a bunch of money to get premium upgrades.  ""Balanced game"" my ass.
"
14536,Great games
14537,it's pretty good.
14538,"tanks are cool
"
14539,This game is good you just nead to add less armor to the AMX 38 and 40 . Its kinda to op
14540,"The grinds are same as PC and Console, Easy to use on PC, Best of all NO ARTILLERY! making grinds easier to go through (If you want to go down a certain one) The premium tanks are much cheaper and spending less than 100$ on tier 8 premuims does save me alot. Except instead getting free XP of the market like on console you get your free XP of premuim tanks to get in game tanks. Update 4.2.0 with the new french line is a challenge, but overall if you have patience in game battles of 7v7 not a 15v15 or 30v30. This is worth the download. Other than they need to add the Emblems on your tank."
14541,Good Game !!!
14542,Very good game. Runs on the pc very smoothly! Extremely wide array of tanks to choose from :)
14543,Ntapp :v
14544,"shit only word to describe it 
"
14545,"great game
yes, the ballance is a bit edgy at places but thats to be expected from wargaming
the game is fun to play and it rewards good players
yes, its grindy but its free to play and there  are ways to get premium vehicles which help with that
the comunity is... not the worst
its also very well optimised
also there is no arty





whatever i said above still stands
however
waht i must adress is that there is no tutorial(beyond the basics that is)
so what is happening right now is that 95% of negative reviews come from players who havent played past tier4 (because most tier4s are bad, and they are bad not because its something wrong with them, no, its because tier5s are so much better)
and those new players have no idea how to deal with those stronger tanks whch they now face
so naturally they get frustrated, quit the game and write an angry review

for the new players out there
watch some videos and most importantly 
LEARN
LEARN the game mechanics and the ways to take advantage of them
BE AWARE
you have a minimap on your screen LOOK AT IT its what its there for
MOVE
always try to be in the right place at the right time




Being now older and wiser I hate this game. Not with much passion but still hate. Premium ammo at higher levels just destroys balance.

 Events got worse and worse.

 And the teams... It's idea of balancing me out for being good is to give me a team of morons. You might think that I'm just being cocky or something but when with one shot of kv2 I do more damage than the top 3-4 teammates combined it's depressing. 

Then the premium tanks.  A lot of them are insanely OP and I know because I got a few of them in events. Once through nolife grinding and once through nolife grinding and p2w. Some others like the anime pz4 are fine but then it's just a pz4 with funny crew sounds.

Overall it's p2w and the one good game is not worth hours of bad time."
14546,"Awesome and fun version of World of Tanks!! This is a cross-platform game where you are playing in real time with users on tablets, phones, and PC. There are many maps and many tanks to research, and you battle in a 7 versus 7 live battle with a tank of your choice. All the content is available for free, there are no limits to playtime, tiers, or tournaments. Some tanks are only available with paid purchase, however you can win them for free with the free random crates they give out, total of 25 crates per week for free! There are usually events every month or two where you can earn free 'event' tanks. The developers keep making new maps and content, and balancing the game. There is a 'premium' time you can purchase to help you make more credits, but it is super cheap like 7$ per month, and they give out free premium time occasionally too."
14547,"World of Tanks!

A part of the gaming industry with a long history enjoyed by players from many nations all throughout the world. A strong but delicate art that aims to make players and spectators alike more upstanding, intelligent, confident and proud both on and off the battlefield. To learn World of Tanks is to armor the heart of a warrior, the soul that embraces and burns with masculinity. Intense and strong like, a tank's iron. Fast and lively, like the clattering of its tracks. And finally, passionate and precise, like its main weapon.

If you play World of Tanks, you will become a better husband, a better father, a better student, and a better worker. You will become healthier, resistant, stronger, and women from all over the world will fall to your feet. This is your chance. Train your body, train your mind, embrace World of Tanks and blossom as a man on the field of battle!

Come Forth Tankers!"
14548,"Would I recommend this game? Well, I could see some people liking it. For me however; I find this game insulting to tanks and tankers. This game mocks realistic tanks and combat in every way possible. I do not know if the original world of tanks was like this or not. For example, this game adds tanks that DID NOT exist in real war. Such as the Hellsing tank destroyer, which is a double barrel tank destroyer; the Dracula medium tank, which according to the World of Tanks Tankopedia, is Dracula taking the form of a tank. WTF!!!! So me as your average tanker has to fight a ""tank"" that is suppose to a mythical being. How i am, suppose to do that?? The Drac tank is faster than most tanks, has a very good gun, and plenty of health to spare. Here is more ""fanatasy tanks"", The Fupus, Tankenstein, t34 (1776), 0-47, Edelweliss, Nameless, and Kpfpz 70 which is a real tank, however IT IS A MODERN TANK! So WOTB has a modern tank fighting tanks that are WW2 and maybe Vietnam tanks because thats fair.


Now about the game phsyics. They need some help. For example, the game has it that even if there is a building between you and the enemy, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE SPOTTED!!! Forget about stealth altogther, because you will always be spotted.  In fact, throw strategy out the window, because this game's fighting is just a clusterf*ck anyway. The most you can plan with your teammates is which direction you will go, left, right, or center. Thats it."
14549,"Boom, Bam, Pow Pow. Lo consiglio solo che non si può collegare l' account che creai tempo fa sulla xbox a quello per pc"
14550,"Kinda fun until you reach the level where everyone else has either bought the better tanks (pay to win) or is somehow cheating (hard to tell which, can't be bothered to find out). Couple that with being placed on teams where half the players are either AFK or just there to drive into walls, and it's a recipe for frustration."
14551,"Although this is a simplified version of the WoTs game it is a much friendlier, faster game without the trolls common to WoTs. I find it to be a game to relax in and just enjoy.
Yes, to advance in the game in takes a bit of money, and Premium Time give you more rewards, just as in WoTs, but the cost is much less.
You can play for free at a basic level, but I find it takes a small amount of cash to truly have fun. But, after all, “Nothing is Free!”
"
14552,"this game took my life
my money
my soul

yet i still play it..."
14553,i wouldnt recommend anything from this ret.arded company
14554,"Ok, I wo"
14555,"It's kind of World of Tanks.... ""Lite®""
Oh sure.. it's still WOT and it's a tank game.. and there's [i]nothing[/i] wrong with that...
It's just more... ""arcade-ish"".... and less filling.
Kind of like Chinese food....
Sure it tastes good, and you feel full... then half an hour later you want to drive tanks again.

[spoiler] Would be nice to get the REAL WOT in Steam though... just saying.[/spoiler]"
14556,Very fun and exciting
14557,substitute for World of Tanks
14558,"Really cool game.

I just think the developers should spend more time balancing 
instead of implementing new tanks and so on.

Improvements to be made, definently.

7/10
Recommended."
14559,40 minutes of gameplay. and i already popped my cherry
14560,"It lacks the most BASIC of controls...like.. HOW TO GET THE MENU!

"
14561,"Amazing game. I personally really enjoy this game because the gameplay is amazing, very few glitches. The graphics aren't the best, but are prime for lower end computers. The entire game is a grind, it takes forever to get to the better vehicles but in the end it extremely fun and well worth it."
14562,cool
14563,Really good game & nothing better for relieving stress after a day at work.
14564,"The game itself is not bad, but unfortunately, like World Of Tanks, World Of Warships & World Of Warplanes, it really is a pay to win senario. It's their business model unfortunately and can make the whole game annoying to say the least. Would I recommend it, no, as like all of their games, it is a cash cow with no return."
14565,It's fun
14566,"Many unexpecting users of World of Tanks  Blitz could be at risk of being hacked by bitcoin miners using their graphic cards, unexpectedly any time of the day , or all day,  peaking gpu usage, power and slowing the frames per second display, and game play... bewarely of ip modificationn, and system change. have that happen to you, then say and find out how to delete or remove  the ip change, routing  and less intrusion of your gaming computer.   more gaming, not less."
14567,The best tanks game on steam !!
14568,"The game has outstanding game play, grachics and surroundings with a wide range of tanks, maps and paints and much more.
there are many maps and there are always more still comming.
There are also training rooms, touraments, pro battles, standerd battle and event battles for times of year.
If you dont like somthing for want to add somthing, you mesage Wargaming a ticket and ask for what ever you want.
There could be alot more to add but that can come in later. 5 stars 

"
14569,I LOVE THIS GAME
14570,"Eventho it is actually a mobile phone game, but it is also fun to play on pc. This game is also a good time killer and their matches are not too long. Variety of tanks made this game easily enjoyable because of the lust of upgrading and keep upgrading to becomr the best. Overall, good game!"
14571,It's quite good for a mobile port
14572,"uninstalled, rudimentary game play, there's no way to convert 100,000's back to ""gold"" for armour peircing shells. I'm not up for pay to play / win type games"
14573,"This game is just a clone of ""Adolf Hitler's Battle Grounds"""
14574,"Poor balance between not only classes, but also premium and non-premium vehicles. 

Attrocious business model with literal premium ammunition and consumables being sold. 

Clunky controls, poor controls, poor netcode, and corridor map design. 

Stay away from this mess and any other Wargaming Titles."
14575,Very GOOD!
14576,Casual FUN on Mobile Android
14577,suks pay to win trash
14578,"Best tank war

The only thing that makes this useless is the voice chat, it would be awesome if we should discuss strategy with our team mates over voice,not just by typing on keyboard."
14579,"just amazing needs more tanks like the actual one thats why i always wait for more updates hopefully it is still diffrent from the console versions / bigger versions

perfect for smaller running laptops or perfect for handheld devise (i have it on my tablet with same account and tanks so it nice that it can be transfured from multiple devices)"
14580,Nice tank strat game
14581,Nice
14582,"Gives a chance to play a multiplayer free-to-play game on the Steam platform. If you're into military armored warfare, from after its very beginning in World War I to the top machines coming out of the boards in late World War II, I highly suggest you give WoT: Blitz a try."
14583,n o
14584,"The good way to waste your time!


You either win too fast or lose the same, game decides to itself and doesn't depend on your skill. When you try to complete some missions, it, of course, gives you a match without any chance to do it.

So, if someone likes when he/she controlled by useless peace of ""you know what"" and has a lot of free time, it's your type of game. For all others there are many really good and interesting ones."
14585,I love it and it a lot better then world of tanks on mobile
14586,"Very good game, needs some skills and is fun with friends"
14587,Fun for when you just wanna have a quick game or two during like 5 minutes of free time.
14588,"Unplayable. First of all I run on a private network with 80Mbps. All other game work fine, no lag, no package loss. But in this game, my ping show only 30-35, package loss is none. But my tank running without control, Its turn left when I only press forward or just random wiggle around. The gun suddenly become... Elevated to the sky and I check my ping, its still 3-4x. I check the page of the game. Its a existed problem for long time but the dev may be dont want to fix it at all."
14589,"boring
"
14590,So basically this game you need to pay to win if not you will keep losing and losing until you will get mad yourself. You win one game after that you lose a couple of games. The team balance is questionable. It feels like the pro vs amateur team balance. At times the game physics doesn't make sense for example your tank has the biggest firepower but still a light tank can still deflect your shot.
14591,Great game gameplay has more action theres no trolls or campers or less at least shorter rounds and overall fun!!!
14592,Pls Give me Luck or Nice tank. ill be loyal
14593,You either lose horribly or win incredibly fast. Not very fun to play
14594,"» Co mi się nie podoba w grze?

14598,graphics and gameplay stink!
14599,"ive been with WoT wragaming inc for roughly 8 years since closed beta and the game gets worse and worse
the devs rng program is the worst of all times STEALING skill and replacing with a random number generator that decides for you HIT/MISS/BOUNCE/DAMAGES, GREED seems to be the motivating factor, quality sure as h e double hockey sticks has gone out window, they need to remove the cheating proximity spot LINE OF SIGHT look it up does not mean anything youve emplaced. could be a great game if GREED for our american money was not the driving factor PAY 2 WIN. infact its pay to get good mm and the highest of rolls in their rng program. these devs play on your inferiority complexes.the game was fun. (in beginning)but the devs have lost their way making profit higher priority than quality.if quality existed i would even support 8 years not once have i supported because they just keep thinking up ways to improve their wallet not quality of game
pay and ill give you the better rng rolls and match making (mm) a random battle starts set for 1 team to win and 1 to lose not a 50/50 chance at start 1 teams rng has been set to low rolls  in other words shots are set to miss bounce not to do damages
a random battle should always start 50/50 chance to win. the devs appear to be greedy and want more than their willing to give thumbs down after 8 years. the arty didnt need removed just needed the damages nerfed down thats it,instead they first ruin arty with manuverabilty issues and real SLOW reloads in real life it doesnt take me 30 secs to load a 75lbs bullet 15 tops my arse is on the line. the awards they have won.the people who gave out awards obviously did not and do not play the game and gave awards for broken game.. the devs need to go and just drive a bulldozer and get a real feel for how tracked vehicles work. the devs need to reread dictionary for definition of (Line of Sight) and while there, they need to re read the definition of GAME.using the radio listen for other tank in area was not used until latter half of beginning of tanks proximity spots need removed another skill stealer. cant properly flank when game cheats for enemy and spots you up even though not 1 enemy can see you.being spotted through big rocks trees and bushes is a joke not moving not firing and enemy can spot you but you cannot see whats spotted and attacking you people disapear right in front of you in open and your the 1 getting fired upon GAME has a lot of broken aspects especially for F2P players most paid players are children with their parents credit cards.i believe you need paid yes but not for purposely broken stuff."
14600,Good Game
14601,Good game !
14602,"I changed my mind about this game, choose War Thunder, better gameplay, no pay to win a lot of fun. Wargaming sucks, they make really bad games"

14605,My computer is too bad to run World of Tanks. This is the best fix for it. 10/10 my shit computer that I bought for $50 can run this at 60fps.
14606,"Fun game, but really drives me nuts when I get a loss after loss despite doing well in a battle. Needs much better balancing to be tolerable."
14607,"If you tell about interesting game of console type, you tell about Blitz.I shall listen with pleasure. I with big pleasure play Blitz on my Phone. Tap-games hasn`t scense after few days played. But Blitz interest don`t fade away after months."
14608,"Игра хорошая, затягивает своим геймплеем. Играю уже давно, начал ещё на андроиде, увидел что есть в стиме. Есть небольшой минус - это баги. Я один раз наткнулся на такой баг я постреди боя улетел кудато в небо. А в принципе игра хорошая."
14609,this thing actually a great game but World of tank blitz actually made for mobile so if you want play this game i recomended this game -----> https://worldoftanks.com/ it is a same game from same developer but made for computer
14610,"зачем,зачем   это  мобильная  игра   с    мобильными   раками   и   через монитор на таких раков оооооочень страшно смотреть"
14611,"This game has promise.

But the balance is totaly screwed. Basically if you play medium tanks you will rule the field, anything else is a target.

I started on the Tank Destroyer tech tree and boy oh boy was that a mistake! A TD in WoT Blitz is a sniper who is blind and has a pellet gun, sounds great huh! You can park on a hill and shoot your enemy, be amazed as a crew member anounces 'one more like that should do it!' then watch as the medium tank you just nailed has a health drop that barely registers. Such fun! Then said medium will spot you from across the battle field and just charge, you can nail it to your hearts content and be lucky to knock off half it's health, then the medium tank opens up and with its first shot your health is knocked down 50%, after a 2 or 3 second reload the medium tank fires again and you are f*%#@d. So yeah in WotBlitz a medium tank can shoot through a TD's frontal armor but not the reverse, cool huh!

A medium tank however is fast, has great frontal  armor, a powerful rapid firing gun and superior maneuverability, great balance huh! And never mind range, that medium tank cannon is just as powerful and accurate as a TD or Heavy from right across the field.

So yeah, great game if you want to play medium, pretty frustrating for any other class. Also, seems like russian mediums are that much better again! WoT, just get rid of every class other than medium then call it a day, or fix the f*&#$ng balance cause its sh%t now!

14613,"Been Playing this game for a while and watched it go through many changes. There was apoint where they had the micro transactions just right but the new equipment system and sigils and the weird premium tanks, in my opinion take away from the game, its all just become a pile of blah. Since the new equipment system I've just been playing the tanks as they are and trying to have fun that way. Also, the money system is nerfed, theres a point where when winning a battle, you should be gauranteed to at least not lose money. It's not unusual to lose upwards of 55,000cr after WINNING an engagement. The events that allow you to ""win"" a tank are trash, I mean, absolute trash. If you really want a tank during these events, just get yourself ready to pay because at a certain point all you can do is get enough sigils or whatever and click the ""maybe"" button to see if you won (spoiler: you never do). I also experienced censorship, during the election they removed chat from the game and then brought it back after. Over all this game used to fill a void for me that the full WOT seemd to miss at but I've been in th market for a better alternative ever since they changed how you win event tanks (last and only tank I ever won was the Dracula). War Thunder might be in my future....."
14614,"Hosts Events where less than 1% of the player base gets the reward.

Gold suddenly cost 55€ in steam store when advertised as 50$ in game.

Premium time is meaningless since new currencies get interduced and new tanks are useless until reseached top gun.
Hence the way to enjoy the game is to be casual and play tier 5 and lower, and only have a few tanks.

It is very rare people will attemt teamplay and use the focus of their tank to the teams benefit. (Scouting / Armor) or attemt to help teammates.

Gameplay is good, many of the tanks play very diffrently."
14615,"Great game
"
14616,Very arcady and unrealistic and pay to win especially with the premium and golden ammo. If you want a decent tank game go get War Thunder its free and not p2w
14617,"though it would it be a bad game.it wasn't.i uninstalled it twice.only to install it again.this game knows how to hook players.atleast i am hooked.
"
14618,"It is a fun game.
"
14619,Dont waste your time.
14620,"Good Game, the best thing about it is it runs really well, the worst thing is that . . . nothing."
14621,i think real wot
14622,Played it a bit and it seems good.
14623,"A mediocre mobile game gorged with such grotesque microtransactions as premium ammunition, premium consumables, paywall-locked vehicles and equipment, paywall-locked upgrades, pay-to-skip grind, monthly subscription benefits, and paywall-locked cosmetics.  Keep your money and your time away from these gold-digging wretches and play something less willing to throw away all dignity for the contents of your wallet."
14624,...
14625,quick fun game
14626,"is good game,but have lags in battles"
14627,"Best Tank Game I've ever seen
"
14628,"Nice Game, recomended for fun"
14629,"Many think blitz is shit and doesn't stand to the pc version, but i've had enough on my plate to say it actually does.
Having played both games, i can say  wotb, as the title says is BLITZ. everything happens faster. Smaller maps, smaller teams(7v7 instead of 15v15) and less match length. Tanks have also different mechanisms and there is no cancerous arty to worry about.
The game was originally designed for mobile platform devices, so you can run on a fair 60fps on a quite outdated pc on medium graphics. The effects are well designed, the sounds are okay, physics do exist and last but not least, there are mods. They are not officially supported by wargaming but if they don't interfere with the game rules, they can be used very easily.
There are game bonuses such as daily and weekly chests that can drop everything from silver coins to high end premium tanks, daily missions and rewards, new events with every upcoming update, monthly tournaments and most importantly; boosters that can be used for many different purposes.
World of Tanks blitz i can say is the csgo kinda tank game you'd pick. Teamwork speaks first, then personal skill. There is no pay to win kinda bullshit, but pay to advance (golden coins and premium tanks). Since this game is free, it's definitely worth giving it a shot, and since it's blitz, you can also play on the go :)"
14630,Best Game Eva!!!!
14631,piece of garbage. Used to play this game alot when it was on mobile but now everything is just trash
14632,"Excellent game. Highly recommend. Just be prepared for the odd idiot that dies quick and spends rest of battle blaming everyone else :) other than the odd annoying idiot its got to be tried. I also have to add that i strongly disagree with the few pay to win comments, as with many games that are free if you want to advance qickly then you probably will have to open the wallet but if your prepared to put in the time, complete tasks amd battle when multipliers are available you can progress without spending anything. I've only been playing for 5 months and have tanks ranging from tier 1 to tier 7 and havent opened my wallet to WG yet. GIVE IT A TRY, you cant lose trying and who knows, you might LOVE IT :)"
14633,FIX YOUR SHITTY PING FOR AUSTRALIA PLS I HAVE PERFECTLY GOOD INTERNET BUT WHEN I GET INTO A MATCH THE PING IS LITERALLY ABOVE 3000 but the game is really good
14634,I think pretty kool game thats wy i like it.
14635,"wally warriors,deep pockets,oofy players,he spammers,bias tankers,cheeki breeki,yolo players,cool tanks,good strategic maps,and........................CHEERS"
14636,GAME IS NOT PLAYABLE DEVS PLS FINISH GAME BEFORE RELEASE
14637,i don't need to explain just read the other negative comments
14638,It's very fun and cheap to play I'd reccomend it to anyone
14639,"normal version of World of Tanks is much better :P Ive played this many hours on tablet and its ok, but on pc..."
14640,hi
14641,"It's not a bad game, but it's worse than World of Tanks.
It's like a dumbed down version with worse graphics.
I guess it's not bad if you never played WoT."
14642,Not fun.  Not enough modes of vehicles.
14643,"I played this game big WoT brother for couple years already (still playing it from time to time with friends) and I can tell you that WoT Blitz is good.

Pros: 
- Battles are shorter, about 2 mins: battles have more action, I practically don't see snipers sitting whole battle in the bushes, it's just doesn't work here.
- no arti.
- gold rounds has less damage (or less penetration in some cases), so you think twice before shooting it.
- +-1 tier is much better comparing to +-2 in big WoT
- no need to put any money if you are playing I-VI tiers
- this is not Pay-to-Win. You can buy everething with silver (ingame currency). It's pay to progress faster.

Cons:
- of course Wargaming wants to milk your money, so stock tanks suffer until you have 100% crew and open at least a second gun on it.
- the most of the tank trees are built to have a couple very bad tanks to stimulate you to spend money and just past it.
- maps are very similar... just hills. Very little difference in tactics - stay close, don't get yourself in crossfire, attack when you have advantage in numbers. Maps don't change that. Big WoT has a lot of maps that force you to play differently. A lot of progress needed here.

Suggestions to developer:
- tanks are officially blind, view range is VERY small. It feels very strange. I understand that it because of small maps, but it needs some kind of rework.
- please add some achievements and prizes for them. I like medals, but it would be nice to get 100 gold for Kolobanov medal or for first 100 destroyed enemy tanks...

Overall:
- Good alternative to big WoT
- Fun to play 
- Truly free to play (at least for small tiers where you can be out of stock in 2-3 battles)

14644,so good game

14646,"I really like this game, especially when you heard boom...m!"

noob team make the grinding very insane
WG need to put ""Report Player"" button in battle
Recommended for people with no life"
14649,"Great game, love it
"
14650,It's a good game just it takes along time to upgrade your tanks with out money and you play with tanks that out rank yours and people have to much Experincane than you so you die quicker and the maps teams are not even you play with op tanks tanks that are boughten
14651,"Pay to win.
Not fun.
Feels like it's poorly translated."
14652,"It's ok, I guess. I would rather play it on a tablet than PC, but still fun on the computer platform."
14653,"An adorable game , it's like the baby of World of Tanks :) , the controls are made for Smartphone devices , so you may encounter strange movements.
"
14654,"It is a very good game, with decent gameplay and not too shabby graphics, but the missions are VERY repetitive, so it's easy to beat once you work out how to do it effectively, it's not a hard game to get good at, but it's not bad in genral"
14655,"Every single aspect of the game is setup to milk money out of the customer base.  From crew training, to tank experience, to bonuses with spare parts, to bonuses to experience, to rated matches, to paying to play higher game levels, to buying your way to the highest level of play... every micro aspect no matter how small setup to milk money.   If you don't pay, then you will sit at a disadvantage.    An addictive game but with no meaningful updates and the pay to win structure, it is hard to recommend.  Don't even ask about the match making."
14656,"Good Game, Great Action Game"

14660,good game however completely overshadowed by having to buy extra bonuses to have and advantage with real cash. shame. makes another pay to win title.

14662,good

14664,GREAT GAME! 10/10
14665,OK
14666,Fun Tank game with millions playing all the time its very fun and has new content added every update. i love playing for hours and worth spending money on as the game is not pay to win or pay to play
14667,"It's Nice and all. But i would play War Thunder more Instead of this because that game is More competitive! But i do recommend this, you'll love it"
14668,"why this game better than PC version ?
1. Good Matchmaking(tier 1 not facing tier 4 max tier 2)
2. No arty
3. Many tank have a same stat normal stat before they get nerf in PC ver
4. You easly get premium tank in this game( just when you lucky get it)

14671,its a sad and pathetic excuse for people who cant actually play the normal game and try to play this trash version that should have stayed on tablets
14672,"Pay to win as fuck. Toxic teammates. No balance. Basic maps. Dumb reward system. No fun to play.

03/10

The progress in the tank research system and the tank models are good, that's the only thing... but the upgrade system is ""meh""."
14673,"I'm still playing this game after 3 years but I will leave a negative feedback to new players. 
Game used to be really good, but then noobs came, I find myself playing always in platoon because if I don't; I risk getting a team of under 47% WR players (the average is 48 LOL  not even 50!!!) I myself am 67% WR 18k battles. I need to play insanely good at all times, always careful play not so much fun and rush. Wargaming makes billions, google wargaming revenue and see for yourself. This game is pay to win, the new mechanics for upgrades forces you to use gold if you don't wanna play stock tank without equipment (vertical stabalizars, cammo net, etc.) for tier 7 to upgrade 1 takes around 2-3 days... so most of the time I just grind to upgrade my tanks with my already upgraded tanks and wait while they are upgrading... 
2/10"
14674,"So I've played this game and its console counterpart for roughy 5 years. I absolutely love it. people will have their opinions but ive spent a good amount of money on this game with roughly 20+ premium tanks and well over a year worth of premium time. Most will say the grind for high tiers is relentless but once you learn the mechanics you will be a force to be reckoned with. i have 4 tier 10s and all of my countrys are tier 6 and higher. anyone who says its next to impossible to pass tier five i would have to assume that they havent quite grassped the mechanics yet. Amazingly fun whether you are playing the console version or the mobile version. just like any other game it takes time to learn. definitley not a game you can just pick up and constanly win on, but once you learn its an amazing game to play. In closing with the $1000 plus dollars ive spent its an overall amazing game, just give yourself time to learn and you will have fun. remember you will lose a good amount of games but it gets better. Hang in there anyone who feels like this game isnt winable, it most definitley is it just takes time."
14675,"the games not as bad as some say, No you wont point click shoot and die, not right away, also its usaually HEAVY tanks that murder you in a ""LIGHT"" tank, yes small mobile and lightly armered get burnt out faster, should this dicourage you however, MId tanks and other heavies can burn out heavies. also if you take out the treads and engines, they're useless no matter what tank you use. its more of a tactical(battle to battle) thing, Position and manuevering is importent. use your brain( i know we all have them, not all of you like to use them), and you'll get alot of points out of it. another good trick, level your crews, they cant function without the tank, and vise versa. 

most of all, its just a game, no need to get bent out of shape, its a game based on tank skirmishes, a small ""timed"" conflict, shit will fly, and like war, its unpredictable. Would I recommend this game? yes, does it require patience? Most Certainly. will you die alot? YES!!!! but it is fun game, just need to think before you act because ""Leroy"" got fired from his tank duties A LONG TIME AGO!!!"
14676,best game
14677,i have played this game for 3 years.The worst update was 3.7 or 3.8 (i forgot) they ruined the equipment system by shitting them.I think they can improve this game by adding another mode instead of adding another tank line and try not to put HISTRORICALLY MAPS like (maya ruins).But im still recommending this game to everyone.
14678,10/10 would definetely ram another tank again
14679,"This game is really addicting XD
Fun tank battle, simple but also realistic physics, and various tactics & maps."
14680,"(edited)
I made a review in 2017 and here is my 2019 update. Recently I have played this game and its has gone down the absolute shitter with way to many broken aspects that ruin the game"
14681,"As someone who plays actual world of tanks, and quite sucessfully I might add. This game is so much fun. That is if you're like me. And have prior experience on World of Tanks and in-turn want to take the enemy team, throw them in the bathtub, and then toss in a plugged in toaster. Overall fun experience smashing skulls on the real World of Tanks downgrade."
14682,This is a fun game. Starts off not as fun but the higher teir tanks you get are much more fun
14683,"I loved the iphone version of this game, and the PC version didn't disapoint. I love this game it is so fun! The only problem I had was the price, it's a free game! A game that good should be $15 at least. Over all it's a really good game and I haven't come across any problems so far and the graphics are pretty good. I rate it 4 and a half stars! (out of five)"
14684,Warning! Game mode is not Fair! you play many times in Lower base Tanks vs. Highrank tanks!  WG manipulate this game!
14685,"i thought this was world of tanks

but its turns it was a lie"
14686,Love your game but I would love it more if you world add 15 v 15 battle's that only let players with great internet in the battles and stuff
14687,ITS THE BEST
14688,"it was a good game back then when its community not full of toxic kids who fire gold all time at you no matter how many armor you have just ignores it goes through and deal same damage you can hear lovely heat sound 'tıssss'

also there is a TON of op premium tanks like  helsing,dracula,nameless,b2,pz2j... etc these things are compelety broken

matchmaking is broken since 2015 (when i started the game) your team or other team have all heavys or all td or all lights

this game have rng no no not the normal one a big one just look at russian 122 guns alpha,accuracy it just ignores it's statics you can snipe a e25 on 500m but can't hit 25 meter in front of you

also a lot of grinding to get tier 10 and what you get more heat's tısssss  

and yeah did ı mentioned broken tanks just look at russian's kv2 and isu 152
ı myself have kv2 and b2 but ı stopped playing with those because ı feel bad when ı playing with those

overall grind=pain
           getting op tanks=feeling bad also satisfying
           ıt can be a good game when you fix those but ıt looks like they are not going to fix any of these because they are milking money from ''premium'' accounts,rounds,tanks  im done playing this game anyone wants to play it just try it it can be good in low tiers but when you came tier 7,8,9 (if you can grind) you can see all broken things in game.

14692,"Classic Pay to Win. AVOID. 

Premium tanks were usually in the realm of tier 8 tanks, now they are everywhere, from tier 6 to 10. 

There is no balance. None. Tanks are almost never nerfed. Only buffed which is fundamentally flawed. Developers even admit to buffing tanks they enjoy playing (on Youtuber streams.) Compared to even last year, the game became a rush to steamroll a flank. A game can end in 30 seconds. Usually ending in less than 3 minutes out of 7. It's too fast, but that's probably what they want. ""Can't cope, buy a gold tank.""

MISSILE TANKS. Omg. Why even allow this in a tank game? Hide behind a hill and missile the enemy while they can't even see you. The whole game is designed around armour and using the terrain to your advantage. These tanks nullify that completely and developers are too pig headed to remove it even though the majority of the players and streamers despise it. 

Extremely overpowered gold (bought with cash) tanks that will make the average noob a pro, check the average damage of a Smasher player, a tier 7 premium heavy. Over 50% wins with 2000 average damage, while in a normal (free) tier 7 they struggle to get 1000 average damage and 40% WR.

They have crates which already screams avoid. Usually single digit % drop rates and can cost hundreds of USD. 

Events are a sham, you either play constantly to win the ""prize"" which is usually a mediocre collectors tank or you get stuff like a key to a box WHICH YOU MUST BUY!

Bugs still present when I started playing this 4 years ago... 

Lag spotting, if you spot an enemy the game will lag and you can't fire first or react fast enough and usually take damage. 

Shells that go through tanks and even gives you a nice puff as it hits the ground behind the tank. Thanks.

The gun shooting in the wrong direction, hilarious. Caught it twice on recording, while for my teammate on the same internet connection it looks like I just shot in a random direction for fun. 

Massive lag spikes and package losses, this can happen due to a number of reason but according to PingPlotter, it's always on the server end. Conveniently they stopped asking for PingPlotter results on their support page. 

They completely buggered up the lower tiers 1 - 5 by removing most of the tanks to ""help lower tier players"". All it did was cause newbies (not noobs) to reach higher tiers faster without a diverse tank role experience (heavies, light, medium and tank destroyers) and they get absolutely smashed by experienced players and of course the Mastercard/VISA warriors. 

There is only random (and ratings battle - I won't cover but its more or less the same) matchmaking which can place you, and it will, with a team full of absolute tossers while the enemy gets unicum (above average skill) platoons in gold tanks. And yes, the pro players will usually play the overpowered tanks because why not? The game is fundamentally broken anyway. I've had matched where the enemy team was 7 out of 7 gold tanks while I had 0. Our team was steamrolled. Players were about the same skill wise so gold tanks made the difference. 

EVERYTHING is overpriced in the store, even a tank 'camo' which is just a repeating image template is thousand of in game gold. 

Yes I'm ranting because you get tired of it after a while and no I'm not a complete noob, I'm a unicum player with over 60% WR and average tier of 8.9. Uninstalled it."

<<<<<<>>>>>>
Positives: 
- Easy to learn controls
- Great for all ages

Negatives:
- Lack of maps

- Games are 2-4 minutes long [b]NO MATTER WHAT[/b]
- The UI and overall graphics seem to be built for a PC running Windows XP
- The majority of online players are [b]MOBILE PLAYERS[/b]. With this said, finding a challenge is going to be hard with you paying on the master race PC.
- Costs for upgrades are too much, leading to unnecessary play time
- No ranking system
- [b]PAY TO WIN[/b]
- WG Greed 
<<<<<<>>>>>>

I can go on and on about these cons. If you want to play a WoT IP, play the actual PC version. I can understand how this game would appeal to users with old systems who cannot smoothly run PC WoT. However, I still believe this game should not be on steam and needs to be removed as soon as possible.

On the bright side the download was quick. So I wasn't upset when I uninstalled after 10 minutes of gameplay.

14730,"fun game to begin with but the match making sucks, you start of with a horrible tank and end up in battles with players who has played 100+ hours with the best tanks in the game"
14731,love better thta ipad/phone woooooooooooooooooyeah thanks steam PS fix settlers 7 spent 11.00 bucks dosent work in the end my old disk worked anyways this world of tanks is awsome thanks woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;
14732,"I play both WoT and Blitz, i enjoy playing both depending on what mood im in, i play blitz for the fast paced battles and i play WoT if i want longer battles, great game overall"
14733,"Positives:
-small and simple
-technically well made and sometimes fun

Negatives:
-Wargaming's greed knows no bounds, at every step they are fcking us for money
-It is pay-to-win no matter what WG or those invested in the game say
-it's also pay-not-to-suffer ""upgrade process"" which is nothing but a soft pay wall
-few hours playing leave a bitter taste thanks to all dirty, cash milking tricks WG employed
-WG greed 2.0"
14734,in a world far far away there is a planet full of tanks and it is called world of sentient driveable tanks
14735,I love the game the only thing I would like to recommend is that they add controller options like some of the other games on steam. Then it would be a real blast other than that its perfect.
14736,Good Drive Good Shoot
14737,GR8 Game!
14738,nc game
14739,"Have Not spent a Dime, Also have lost al 12 games, not spending $24 to get a premium tank to win, and not fun enough to pour 100 hours in to get a good free tank"
14740,The less time consuming version of World of Tanks.
14741,"It would really fun if it supported PS4 controllers/steam controller!!! 
LOVE THE GAME"
14742,"This is not a free to play game, THIS IS A PAY TO WIN GAME, and if you don`t pay >> NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT, at least not one that does anything ..."
14743,Do not install this.
14744,Beware of Russian Damage
14745,"again i do grind but i hate it when it comes to fucking not getting to any point like you have to waste hours and hours getting to the next  tier then when you finally get the last tier every single goal or point just ended there and you fucking look in the mirror and think "" i wasted my fucking days and hours of grinding and FOR WHAT! getting the last tank and not have fun anymore..."" this game does not have any good replay value i suggest just playing war thunder or battlefield."
14746,"Seriously no reason to play blitz on steam while you can simply download the regular world of tanks, they should of brought the true WoT instead of porting the mobile version to PC."
14747,"I do like this game a lot, both on mobile and on the pc. Something that needs to be adressed though is that the connection to the server sometimes struggles on the pc. While I have acceptable ping on mobile I can have 1000+ ping on the pc. I do recommend this game, I do, but this is something people need to know when playing."
14748,"This game, all i can say is its so cool. I played it before on Mobile version, but now on the steam?? 
Maan, You gotta try this game. That's all i have to say, Hoorah!"
14749,"Guys i am having issue below:
world of tanks blitz error joining the battle: you have already join the team"
14750,just get the normal wot unless you're hurting on disk space
14751,I like this version of WoT because is faster and simpler.
14752,GOOD GAME
14753,"This game is very well done, considering Wargaming has tens of years of experience with the best tank game in the world. It's light, textures are optimized, matchmaking is fast, load time is 4 sec and there are noobs all over the place

So if you're new to tanks I recommend this game and if you are an old WoT player, than try this and blast through tiers in days.

I see a lot of WoT annoying stuff fixed in WoTB, let me list a few points :

No arty whatsoever!
Consumables can be reused multiple times in battle. Also there are cool new consumables that boost speed or reload time.
Modules cost only Experience, but no credits.
One Crew per account and crew skills are more like tallents - When tank is 100% you start contributing EXP to your Crew's light, medium, heavy or TD skills, and when you level up a skill you get benefit from it on all tank types. 

Daily 2x experience reset happens twice every day, and missions keep rolling, so still a very addictive model, but overall the grind is way easier in WoTB than in WoT. 

You get 2 days of premium + ~1200 gold. I would advise new players to spend that gold towards buying a premium account and grind some line fast in the start to get a tier 6-7-8 tank and start doing missions and clan platoons.

In WoTB there is a built in visual indicator if a shot will penetrate the armor and its very well done, auto aim works the same way as in WoT so overall there is nice skill ceiling so far, the game looks interesting in its 7v7 format. 


Good luck tankers

"
14754,"I first played it on Android back in 2014. Everything was great back then. Credit earnings were good, grinding tanks were easy, buying equipments were easy. Now? Now it is all about grind fest( goes both for credit and experiece). Credit earning is alot less. They probably cut credit earning by 50% over the last few updates. It will be pain in the ass if you actualy seriously want to grind stuff. 

I will not recommend this game at all. 4/10."
14755,like world of tank.. fun and easy
14756,"some technical issues and banned my child from using it. World of tanks asked me to follow some steps. but didnt work.
Dissapointing for a kid to play and suddenly  ban. stay away from this game."
14757,"Guys don;t play this game because for me it is the best shit game, just go and get orginal War gaming game: World of Tanks there is better graphics and more modes, tanks and generaly WOT is a better game than WOT Blitz, WOT Blitz is orginaly for mobile devices not for PC. Somebody can say that I have 0,0 hours in that game but I played this on my phone. Zamiast dodac normalne WOT to dodajo blitz to jkis oblent !!!"
14758,nope.
14759,Don't play this game unless you want your wallet to vanish
14760,nice replacement if u cant play World of Tanks (the normal edition/game )
14761,"So, here's my review. I've played this game on mobile, Windows 10, and here on Steam. Mobile is okay, but I suck with the touch controls. Windows 10 and Steam are the same. I like this game, regardless of its ""p2w"" style. To me, its not really p2w, because some of those premium tanks just aren't worth it to me. Just a fancy skin on the same tank you can grind for free otherwise. Similar business style to War Thunder. IMO This is the better TANK game than War Thunder, because at least here you don't have random planes bombing the crap out of you. War Thunder's ground forces WAS superior until they started allowing planes in Tank Arcade battles. If you are wanting ONLY TANKS, then this is the game for you. Nevermind the gossip and rumors about ""how the devs treat the players"" just go play the game, and have fun. I've never really had any issue with this game, just a small gripe, I would like to see controller support added to it, because that would make it really enjoyable for me. That is also why I love WoT on PS4, because of the comfortable controller support. If they did it there, they can do it here."
14762,"Super awesome game !
It is just like the pc version but with less players, smaller maps and no annoying spg campers xD
I hope this game will stay around for a long time because I have spent 500-1000 $ on this game
10/10
"
14763,Ok so im not going to make a very long review but i cannot reccommend this game i suggenst you go get the actual game (which is still free) its better anyways you can get it here---->  http://na.wargaming.net/    It also has other cool games like world of warships   and world of planes.
14764,"This is the absolute best WW2 tanks game you can get! If your a 5 year old wanting to point click die and retry. The grind is horrible, you'll get to tier 4-5 then stay there...
Horrible gameplay with a braindead playerbase with no sense of tactical knowhow or teamwork"
14765,its fun but it logged me out and i couldent get back in :(
14766,Hard to get into.
14767,Nice game but original World of Tanks is better!
14768,"Ok, I post this review after I played this game for 24 hours in steam and unknown numbers in iOS. First of all, I recommend this game since I'm a tank lover. But to put it in general, here's pros & cons IMO for this game :

Pros :
+ Massively consume less disk space than WoT PC
+ Easy to control in PC (since I've played WoT PC 3 years ago)
+ Easier to grinding XP than WoT PC
+ Less specs needed than WoT PC, so I can play WoTB in high resolution
+ 5 golds for watching videos (in mobile though)
+ Easier to rank up crews and skill crews
+ Sixth sense, ammo replacer, module penetration chance indicator, etc. are already trained
+ Daily missions are updates twice everyday

Cons :
- Harder to control in mobile (need more experience to adapt it)
- Update 3.8 ruined equipments. Need spare parts means more hours played/more cash flying
- No dynamic platoon (in WoT PC can)
- Harder to tell what kind of your tank's position currently are
- Narrower maps than WoT PC
- No base to base capture mode (only encounter and supremacy [from WoWs])
- The battle feels like no significant changes unlike the PC version
- More ridiculous tanks than the PC version
- You'll less likely get new ""virtual"" friends in this game

Neutrals :
> No artillery
> No LAV (Light Armored Vehicles) means no infantry
> Only 7v7 battles allowed
> No planes or airstrikes (this World of ""Tanks"" LOL)
> Almost still P2W like WoT PC

* Conclusion edit : I don't recommend this game for you who want to play action battle tanks simulator game, but for low spec gamer like me it's up to you. The PC version will release the 1.0 version and will need better spec to play confortably. If you want to play the similar in steam, try War Thunder instead.

**More edit (I love this game so much :v) : For those who said this game is P2W, maybe you haven't play the WOTPC yet. WOTB is more forgiving. Missions are way more simple and can be grinded by tier V-X meanwhile WOTPC mostly can be grinded by tier VIII-X (*cough*Progetto*cough*). To complete the mission you need to pay more and grinding more, while in WOTB you need to grind but pay less even nothing! For the game mechanic you'll getting used to block some damage and deal some damage even without dab 2 keys. For example Side-scrapping, Blocking with Turret, Hit the cupola, and Hit the Driver Hatch. Maybe this tactic won't be used in low tiers but will very helpful in tier VI-X. I hope this review will help you to grind your tech tree easier and make this game more fun (If Skorpion G won't be in WOTB, very meta in WOTPC)"
14769,"i have enjoyed this game for a while and it is great in small doses, best not to be too competitve and there will always be a dickhead being angry about how you are not doing your part even though you have done the most damage/the most kills and are the only one left. That said most games will have the salty players and I do believe it is a fun game to play with a friend if you are bored and want to blow shit up."
14770,.
14771,"Nice game at all, for you who want better graphics try to play WoT at wargaming not this."
14772,"I actually played this game on IOS and I've spent hundreds of hours playing.

""Pay to Win More""

They need to add more tutorials for the game mechanics because some people who play this game are completely fucking retarded with no common sense.

80% of the time no matter what tier your in you will have a chance to have fuck wad teammates.

Blitz is just a Discrace to the PC version.

WARNING 
If you hate stress then don't play."
14773,"What a disaster.

No graphics options, it defaults to 5760x1080 but it's not supported: stretched and cropped.
No escape menu, have to ctrl-alt-del to kill the game.

I uninstalled after that. Who the hell defaults to an unsupported mode with no option to change it?"
14774,"This game used to be good, but many decent players stopped playing because the WG money making bs, so the game is now trash. Do not play if you are new to it."
14775,"This is utter garbage, lag is horrible to severs I normally played on (before realising Wargaming are con artists who do not care about their players only how much money they can milk), the camera wouldn't do what I wanted it do and constant zoomed in and out without me telling it to which was fustrating as all hell and I couldn't see any audio options anywhere so I was left with the game blowing out the speakers in my headphones. 

Then It wouldn't let me log in, kept saying my username was already taken, no shit BY ME!. this is a completely joke, do not support these asshole developers. the ones that threatened DMCA strikes against one of their ""commuinty contributers"" for calling them out on their bullshit tactics."
14776,Best. Game. Ever.
14777,Nice game
14778,Nice game :D
14779,no arty 10/10
14780,You're better off playing the actual World of Tanks or War Thunder unless you like the smaller games
14781,"amazing ten out of ten
"
14782,One of my oldest brother's classmates told me he plays World of Tanks on Steam and it's free to play so I downloaded it just to post this review.
14783,Love and hate are very similar. You will fully experience both while playing this game <3
14784,The ping is sooo terrible on this game it's unplayable
14785,good game
14786,"super fun game
"
14787,Nice game to play if u use laptop or dekstop
14788,"Somehow a very toxic community has developed in this game since it's release. People who've put in many more hours than you go out of their way to message you to trash talk.

Probably a good mobile game relative to other mobile games but in terms of a PC game there isn't too much here to make it worthwhile. Many more fun options out there.

"
14789,FUN
14790,A very fun game. Can be very fast paced and requires a good aim. Great if you are into the war scenery.
14791,nice
14792,GOOD GAME
14793,"BAD GAME PAY TO WIN ,I CANT SEE THE POINT IN PLAYING THE GAME IF U CANT BLEW THEM UP, DID`NT SEE THAT IN WW2  OR ANY OTHER WAR IN THE PAST 50 YEARS"
14794,its good if you're good
14795,"I've seen a lot of people conplaining about how you can get the, ""Real One"". Yes you can get the, ""Real One."" But you can also get this version so you can play your tanks that you didn't get on the normal PC version. Over all this game is real great I have some Premium tanks that I don't have on the PC edition. So overall if your gonna get a Premium tank just get it on the Xbox or PS4 edition. Or even on the PC."
14796,Mobile wot game. Bad show
14797,"its amazing jk 
"
14798,Very nice game
14799,dog
14800,no arty!!
14801,It's good and all but why does the GUP collection have to be annual
14802,"The game does not allow you to progress at your choice.  You can only move on, select new tanks, new modules as the game allows you.  Then you can only battle the battles it forces you to choose.  First two games played against AI's but after that it was clear seal clubbers populate this game.

Would give it a more favorable rating if the control respose and aiming were not so clunky and not locked in to a pre-determined game progression.  Not being able to explore the menus, options, and forced to battle was extremely frustrating."
14803,"This game is AMAZING!!! A really awesome mobile version of the original! If you havn't tried the original, then YOU NEED TO!!! This mobile version is really great because it has smaller quicker maps, so its much more fast paced and action packed. Super cool that you can play with android I phone and pc on the same servers. So you and your friends can play no matter what device you all have!!! I see a lot of people complaing you have to ""pay to win"", and to those people I say ""Thanks for being fresh meat for my meat grinder""! Because all you need is skill to play this game. You dont have to have a high level tank to crush people, because it puts similar tank levels in the same matches. So you just need to have skill. You should at least try this game out because its free. You can have a great time playing all the tanks in the beginning of the game!!! Invite your frinds, make a team and go BLOW $H%& UP WITH THEM!!!"
14804,"
Hi everyone! I've decided to write review about my favorite game on PC that now came to mobile and i can play it on my iPhone and iPad. It's a rare free-to-play game that respects both your time and your money, and it's definitely worth checking out. World of Tanks Blitz is a free-to-play 3D action MMO that shares a variety of gameplay elements in common with the highly popular PC game World of Tanks, such as a variety of mid-20th century tanks to unlock and learn, realistic tank physics, and strategic combat. FUN to Play ;)"
14805,"Wargaming should add the original WoT game in Steam...

Edit: W8 Wtf there's World of Warships Already On STEAM????
Edit #2: The ACTUAL game is on Steam now."
14806,FUCKIN AWSOME
14807,Fucking stupid
14808,"I love this game
"
14809,Mobile version port into PC. Download real WoT
14810,"Amazing!

This game, wow. I played this game on the iPad first but found it hard to control. I saw that it was coming out soon on Steam and I waited and waited. As soon as the game was released on Steam, I played it and couldn't believe it was free! Definately worth downloading."
14811,"This game is rad. To be fair, I've never played the original World of Tanks, but from the videos I see, the tank is a lot bigger and more visible in this game, which I like. It's nice to admire a tank I've just earned, or just put a new camo on. Also, it seems to be a bit more fast-paced than WOT original. I'm loving the gameplay here."
14812,"well this game is a hell lot of a fun to play but it has some graphics i must say that i recomend it for this reasens :

its a tank game witch i really like 

its a jounger brother of wot 

the tds are a bid dificult to play 


OVERALL ITS A HELL LOT OF A FUN :D"
14813,"This game is very awesome, i have palyed more than 2000 hours(mobile version)

THIS GAME IS NOT PAY TO WIN <3"
14814,This game looks non realistic
14815,"Seriously, i am in ...
Enjoying that game."
14816,"Our Track Is Hit,We Can't Move"
14817,Very good game
14818,Ns game!
14819,"Epic, much better than PC"
14820,Warning its addictive !!!
14821,"Good for someone who wanna play WoT but have Potato comp, the control on PC is much better than on mobile devices so it's pretty easy to own people. Still, if your comp is powerful enough, better play the PC version for better more type of tanks and modes."
14822,The Best
14823,Good game for time kill
14824,"I complained the game is pay -to-win, and still managed to spend hundreds of dollar in it. nice"
14825,"I have played tanks on war thunder, and now on blitz. frankly, ground forces on war thunder is better, in my opinion. i have way more hours than it says here on mobile, and im about halfway thru the german tech tree. this games developers have succumbed to greed like many f2p games, as already shown in so many reviews. Im happy i have not been subject to the way the developers treat their players, as this game is slowly showing that paying for things=instant pro skills. f2p scrubs like me and others dont like this. sadly, i have to leave another game with great promise, so ill be looking around now. If your pc can handle war thunder, that is supiror in many ways to this game."
14826,Very fun game if you like playing with friends and form a good team.
14827,This game is good
14828,HITPOINT :v
14829,"If you just want to blow up tanks this is more fun than the ""real"" world of tanks. No waiting 2min per game here. Fewer pros crushing your whole team. You also see when someone spots your tank.  In the ""real"" world of tanks it takes many hours of grinding, per tank, to gain this ability. You should be aware that you cannot transfer your tanks between servers, neither do they transfer to the ""real"" world of tanks.

If you want to play a deeper, more difficult game with bigger teams and maps, accept the fact that you will get stomped while you learn and try the ""real"" world of tanks."
14830,"mantab kalo di pc, di hp nguras batre banget.. mana lag lagi"
14831,"This game is very enjoyable. I personally enjoy this game. The graphics are good, and the tanks looks very realistic. The only thing that I don't like about this game is that the progression takes very long when you at Tier 7+. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone. It just takes practice and time to learn tips and tricks to help you get better at this game."
14832,"can be fun if you just want something quick to play, but  try to play war thunder instead because its VERY well done compared to WoT"
14833,"I myself have played over 4000 matches in this game. I used to play the original WoT, and have tryed going back to it. To say the least, these games ARE different, but that can be a good point. The mechanics are different, and sometimes your playstyle has to change. I have one tier 9, a couple 8s and plenty of 7s, none of which I payed money for. Yeah, it can get grindy, but ALOT of games can be grindy. Not everyone can get master prestige in CoD by pure skill. So people complaining about pay to win and all this nonsense need to shut up and learn how easy it can be to defeat alot of the premium tanks. I will agree, Wargaming.net has not been the best with it's recent updates. In 3.6, they took away the ability to use global chat and speak after death, this was to defer people from raging on the enemy team when they die, but they don't even have a permanent chat filter on the PC WoT. This made me not play the game for a while until 3.9 came out and they brought global chat back. Wargaming.net can tend to be a little ignorant to their community, but they DO listen eventually. In general, I like this game, alot of people play it because it's mobile and for computer, so the matchmaking times tend to be really quick, especially cause it only has to match 14 people instead of 30. I myself tend to only play this game on my PC, but if you wanted to play it on mobile, I would recommend using a tablet. Phone screens tend to be too small and you end up either hitting buttons by accident or not able to see the enemy. In general, I still have fun on this game. It can be a great game to either binge and no life, or just hop on and play a couple games and hop off. DON'T FEEL YOU HAVE TO PAY MONEY TO PLAY THE GAME, THIS IS A FALSE MYTH. It may take a while, but anyone can get to tier 10 with just a lil bit of work. Thanks for taking the time to read this review. And my last point, IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRY THIS GAME, STICK THROUGH TILL YOU GET TO TIER 3-4 AT LEAST BEFORE YOU SAY SCREW THIS."
14834,"Че с балансом , играю на тир - 4 танках против челов у которых по 40 к наигранных каток, пздц"
14835,it's more fun to watch a horse in suit drink vodka
14836,"I really like this game. I have been playing on mobile since 2014 and I started playing on Steam as well and it is a nice alternative, especially if your computer has a hard time handling the full version of World of Tanks. Overall, this game is basically a lighter version of its full edition counterpart. It is still very fun nevertheless and I recommend it to anyone who likes the second world war and military vehicles!"
14837,Very Nice!
14838,fantastic free to play game although i will say the pay to play aspect is and some players do take high advantage of it but if your a decent player it wont really matter since the game automatically pitsa you against tanks of your same caliber either 1 tier higher or lower than yourself i truely enjoy the feeling of getting the last tank kill as their burning tank crawls to a hault lots of tank options and upgrades
14839,"very good time waster, esp. if you find a good clan and platmates
graphic falls short compared to original pc version, but game is more fast paced, less camping 

can't believe the time i sunk into this game until my friend told me"
14840,This game is good enough
14841,It's fun while it lasts.
14842,","
14843,"Since a determined point, if you don't put your real money on it $$$$ you can't do anything more in the game. 
I gave it up because it doesn't worth the money: the only thing that keeps you there, is competition, if wasn't online, and with real players, nobody would put money on it. This means it's not a really good game to play, only a game you can spend your money on it and show it to the others."
14844,"This game can be frustrating at times but I think this game's 7v7 formula and smaller maps make the games shorter and much more rewarding than WOT. I've played 5-6x my hours on this game on IOS and I can say that this game is MUCH better to play on PC, the graphics may not be great but the gameplay is amazing. It is tough to play 100% F2P, so I would bite the bullet and pay up to $20 for a premium vehicle or two to make the game a lot more fun and to make credits basically a non issue. But for the love of god get good before buying a tier 8 premium and trying to play it, you will loose a lot of money and get frustrated when you get dunked on by skilled players in your high tier premium. The early game has been made way easier than it used to be (RIP pre 5.5 WOTB), this means that you won't learn important lessons and mechanics until tiers 5-7. This was done to make the beginning of the game easier for new players but all it does is frustrate those players when they can't perform at higher tiers. So practice and watch videos for beginners, this will make it a lot easier for you to play against experienced players at higher tiers. Also, a few pieces of advice for new players: 1. The Tiger tanks take skill to use and you are far from invincible, so grind some other lines before this (Russian heavies are way easier to play). 2. The KV-2 Sucks if you are a noob and you will get very frustrated if you don't know what you are doing (RIP T-150) 3. Don't play lights at high tier first, you are punished for every small mistake in a light at high tiers and you will die a lot if you don't know what you are doing 4. I would advise any new players to grind these lines first to learn the basics of the game: Russian heavies, Russian TDs (The SU-152 line, the SU-100 line is way harder) American heavies, German TDs (The Jpz IV line, that thing is OP as of writing this), and British mediums. 5. Most importantly, don't take this game too seriously and make sure to prioritize killing anyone who drives a fake tank (The Dracula and the Smasher)!"
14845,bad
14846,"Good game, prefer this over WoT PC because of the quick games, quick queue times and fun tanks to play. Sometimes it feels like I need to spend money to advance but not often."
14847,Amazing game with more and more being poured in from the Pc Version. Highly recommended and probably the best mobile game ever created.
14848,"I would recommend this as it contains many tanks and intense battles. There is a fact however the tanks are very hard to control.That is a down side.I was hoping that it wouldnt be like that-but it was.I didnt want this to happen because I have played other tank games and it was the same. So I thought I'll give it another try but it was the same stupid error.There is a wide range of unlocks  which will leave you playing for a bitbut the tanks weren't really that unique.Also another thing to mentoin is the graphis are very bad. It wasnt really the best game.It is enjoyable from time to time.Out of five stars I would rate it two and a half.This is due to the graphics level and the custamizations.This all my opinion and somepeople probably would disagree and love the game.In conclusion it is one of those average games.

               Rataius."
14849,Update killed this already dead game ... My 6 year old still plays!
14850,"If you want a fun time with a welcoming community, this place is not for you. If you want a pay2win game with horrible team balance, you've come to the right place. Well, I guess it's pretty fun so I guess i'll just recommend it."
14851,OMG you should try this game like no lag it is one of my favorite games!!  ('O')
14852,THIS IS THE WORST GAME IN THE WORLD BETTER IDEA GET WARTHUNDER IT HAS GOOD GRAPHICS IT HAS BOATS PLANES TANKS AND MORE EXPOLSIONS AND ITS FREE YAAAAAAA
14853,Fuckin Awesome
14854,This is one of the worst ports yet.. Nice try though
14855,"how is it possible that your company can put out a game....and have is suck so bad?  you have constant bugs/glitches while playing the game. you have shit for customer support. why can you not make the game just like the PC version..but smaller, i mean its a unique concept and all but for fucks sakes its not that fucking hard. the constant problem of the gun not shooting on the mobile and the pc version of blitz is absolute BS.  Playing blitz on the pc or mobile device is like playing WOT on the PC at full fucking 999 ping.  instead of fixing any issues with the game the idea of just introducing more tanks to buy from the premium shop seems to be the only thing you can accomplish as a company.  you ask for feedback but do nothing to address the issues at hand. we all know that you post bullshit information about being on top of it and that you are all hard at work fixing the issues but, wait a second, after the reviews are turned in you have a sale on premium tanks, or introduce new tanks, or give discounts on premium time...you know, selling shit for more money to pay for you wages so that you can do nothing. I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS VERSION OF WOT FOR ANYBODY. THE PC VERSION HAS ITS OWN PROBLEMS LIKE THE FRIENDS TAB NOT WORKING BUT AT LEAST WHEN YOU PLAY THE GAME YOU CAN ACTUALLY CONTROL WHAT YOU ARE DOING. IT'S NO WONDER EVERYBODY PLAYS WARTHUNDER AND ANY OTHER GAME THAT ISN'T FUCKING WOT/WOTBLITZ."
14856,Garbage!!!
14857,"I've been playing the World of Tanks series of games (started out with normal World of Tanks for the PC, calling WoTM for now) for almost 6 years, and WoTB is quite a fun replacment. I lost my interest in WoTM because of the very broken artillary mechanic (and yes, I used the Arty as well, and found it quite broken, although they claimed to have changed it but I am skeptical), and when I was watching videos on WoTB, it had no arty in it what-so-ever, and I desided to try it out, and I found it to be quite fun, and I have been playing it non-stop ever sense. 

PROS: 
Smaller matches compaired to WoTM means quicker grinding for tank lines, and sometimes comical more chaotic battles. 

New Equipment System: Many players will disagree with my statements (and that is fine), and yes, although the old equipment system was very good, the new one is even better in my eyes. And I will say, at first, I absolutly hated it. The new system allows players to mount 9 different equipment types on there tanks, and all it takes is some grinding for ""Spare Parts"". Many players think the old one is better, most likely because all the needed to do was grind IGC (in game credits), but it only allowed us to mount 3 equipment types total, and some classes of tank, such as tier 5 tanks, wouldn't even get to mount certain equipments because they were too low tiered, namely the Gun Stabilizer, which in the old system could only be mounted in tier 8+ tanks, and now can be mounted on almost any tier. 

Tons of tanks to choose that fit most playstyles:
There are tons of tanks in here, just like WoTM, bar Arty. If you want quick, zippy, deadly tanks, go down light tank paths. If you want a balance of power, go for medium tanks. If you like to camp in bushes and torture your victims, go for Tank Destoryers, and if you like to sit an laugh at people trying to hit your armor, go for heavy tanks. And as the game is still improving just like WoTM, more tanks are in the future. 

Good graphics and gameplay - nothing much to say, although they are not as HD as WoTM, for low-to-medium-end systems (somewhat like mine) they are perfect, but I am not into games for fancy graphics, I play for gameplay.

Cash grinding is quicker do to smaller matches.

Cons:
Smaller matches compaired to WoTM. Although it has it's perks, if you come from WoTM, you might have some withdrawls from the old 15v15 and have to deal with the 7 v 7.

Spare Parts System: Although the new equipment system is good, I will say that the Spare Parts system is somewhat flawed. We should at least earn 1000 spare parts for a victory and maybe 250 for a loss. I've only won about 300 for a victory. This makes getting equipment quite slow and somewhat annoying. The only way to get more than 1k spare parts is to complete missions, but these reset only every 12-24 hours (forgot which lol) To be honest people, the new equipment system really is awesome, but the amount we win spare parts at is too slow for it to be truely effective) - Update 3.10 claims to add new ways to earn more parts per battle. 

Overpowered tanks: 
Although a somewhat realistic feature (example, a Tiger II in real life would blow away a Sherman no problem), many tanks in here are too powerful for what they are. Some notable tanks are the Leopard Light Tank of tier 5, KV-2 of tier 6, LTTB of tier 7 to name a few. What makes them flawed is the raw damage output they can deal, the Leopard only had 2 varients built in real life, so not much is known about it. The KV-2 in game can 1 shot anything at tier 6 and below when using the 152mm gun, however in real life, this thing couldn't even turn it's turret when it was on a hill. LTTB reportedly broke it's suspention when traveling over rough turrain. The LTTB is also a light tank, and it moves as quick as many light tanks of lesser weight and armor, yet it has 90mm of hull armor. I don't think it should be moving that fast (perhaps why it failed in real life) However, these tanks are luckily not without flaws. Leopard has a long clip reload and poor armor. KV-2 has an insanely long reload (upwords of 20+ seconds), and the LTTB is quite large for a light tank and can be easily shot.

There is also somewhat of a ""Russian Bias"" with this game, and many of the Russian tanks are quite overpowered, and seemingly the German tanks are underpowered (even though a real scenario would have the German tanks with the upper hand, depending on the crew, with a few exeptions on tanks) - luckily this bias isn't as great as it is in some games though. And yes, I am parcial to German tanks, but I also use British, American, and Russian, so this is from personal experience. 

The new ""Millitary Honor"" system:
Absolute **** in my eyes. I've been having some stability issues with my computer, so sometimes my computer will crash during game play, and I don't exactly have the cash to buy an entire new rig (luckily I might know the problem and am fixing it) but because of  this new ""Millitary Honor"" system, you're ""honor"" stars go down because random players think you're botting, or AFKing when you could have issues like I am experiencing. In my eyes, this system needs a major reworking or removal. 


And my final and main issue with the game: NO THREE MAN PLATOONS LIKE NORMAL WOTM - I understand that 7 v 7 might be difficult to have 3 man platoons, but we need something cause 2 man platoons is just too small. All I can really say about that. - honestly we should start a petition on WoTB for 3 man platoons for those that agree with this.

Another thing for new players is DON'T JUDGE THE GAME UNTIL YOU'RE AT LEAST AT TIER 5, AND THIS GOES FOR WOTM AS WELL. I've seen too many people quit because they don't invest the time into learning this game. It's not just ""point and click and get a kill"" (unless you're an old arty or KV-2, then it sometime is). There is tons of mechanics in the game for armor, a skill called ""sidescraping"", and many other things that will help you survive in battle. Learn you tank too. A Panzer IV will have a completely different playstyle than a T1 Heavy or KV-1 (these are all tier 5s too, so not compairng two diffrent tiers). Use youtube for education and training, and you might enjoy this game more. 

Note: These are all my opinions, ignore misspellings, etc. 
And that concludes this long winded review.
"
14858,"Good game overall but removing timers and SP would help tho and making the events less shit, not me being salty but its what the community feels, 10k battles and its OK, just WG(devs) know how to stir the pot! (p.s If you just dowloaded the game dont get offers, they're scams.)"
14859,Why does the trailer look like on PS4 with 1080p resoluiton and the game is made for mobiles with 480p resolution?
14860,Best
14861,22
14862,this game is fun but its hard to get coins and how do you get tanks that arent in the game?
14863,"Will not get passed the ""Identifying Region..."" screen, do not know if that has happened to others but it is with me"
14864,"Good game, although it is arguably a ""playable game""

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
+Doesn't require godly specs to run , actually, you can run this on windows xp ..
+nicely optimized , many updates 
+ developers care about the game ...and the money 
+fast paced
+new system protects against griefers 
+ global chat 
+ you can find a suitable region for you if your ping is high 
+many challenges appear once a month or more recent and they give you a chance to get a new tank ""free""

[h1] Cons [/h1]
-I feel like the developers took a wrong turn by adding the new gear and equipment update
-paying players have the upper hand
-developers are kinda greedy
-new rich players that get high tier tanks kinda ruin the game since they don't have much experience, which brings me to another con (if you consider it so) you really need to rely on your team , if player doesn't really care or leaves the match , you might not be able to win the match , you need full team dedication
-biased
-p2p
[b] -devs censor negetaive reviews [/b]
-the matching system doesn't consider skill , if you are tier 1 and have 10 battles you can be matched with people with over 1000 battles 

[h1] conclusion: [/h1]
I would reccomend this game , I really have hopes that the devs will dig themselves out of the hole they dug themselves onto"
14865,"I played WOT Blitz since it first came out, spent $ while I was on the US server, then I moved to Taiwan and re started another account from 0, building it up from scratch. I had spent at LEAST 500 usd in this game along the years, but since the last update with the timers, the parts to collect to grind tanks THAT WERE ALREADY grinded, it sucks. I still play it, and will keep playing, but I will not spend a single penny on this game anymore, and it is just sad that they turned out this way. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME AT ITS CURRENT STATE COS ITS GARBAGE, although I keep playing it just for the sake of being used to it."

14877,Game is fun and i like it but after hearing about how the developers treat their community and people speak out against their pay 2 win style im gonna have to not recommend this game

14879,"HAHA THE BLATANT PAY TO WIN NEEDS TO BE EXTERMINATED. 

pay to win is a symptom of the current dark ages we live in.

any match when u are up against pay 2 win is a certain loss

14880,"If you like a dumbed down WoT game that plays like pee wee soccer games (small field, 7v7, highly imbalanced tanks, and phone/tablet players),  then enjoy the frustration of this game."

14883,"Although I do enjoy playing Blitz doesn't necessarily mean that I support each decision that WG has decided to take with this. In its earlier iterations, it was more akin to WOT-lite, whereas now although still retaining the main components of WOT has changed it's feeling. 

1.NOT EVERYTHING IS BAD
Though I am still just quite the casual gamer, I do find enjoyment when I can find those random matches with others and have a bang up time because teamwork is awesome. Being able from time to time unlock premium tanks is a plus. IE Tankenstein and now the GuP ""Kuro Mori Mine, Panzer Anko SP., and the Hetzer"" is quite nice.

2.GAMEPLAY
Doesn't last all too long and is often quite enjoyable, it's called BLITZ for a reason. Adding new lines slowly and fleshing out old ones is always appreciated. Though there is a disparity in ability for PC vs Mobile since its expansion as PC users can more easily maneuver and aim than when compared to mobile touch controls. The implemented non crossplatform option works as advertised though it does limit the pool of players thus I find that I use my PC as opposed to my iPad.

FINAL THOUGHTS ( June 10, 2017)
-Thouroughly enjoyable for all players looking for tank on tank action though some mechanics are far from perfect
-MOST content unlockable without having to pay, though it is a struggle especially with some glaring ""money grabs"" though it is a company providing entertainment has to make its revenue somewhere
-Sweet visuals and asthetics as both the vehicles and environment are pleasing to the eye
-Events that keep one coming back for more as well as implemented clan/training rooms"
14884,"This game is suppose to be the mobile version of the original game ""World of Tank"". The control, graphic and stuff aint as smooth/good as the pc version.

I would recommend this only if your pc is not good enough to play the pc verison. 

Otherwise, this will be just a waste of you time and/or money, should you decide to pay, as it requires you to spend lots of hours to get higher tier game just like the pc one but for a lesser version and the premium tank aint cheap. So if you wan to invest your time and money, just go download the pc version and the experience of the game will be so much better."
14885,:D
14886,"you can destroy all those mobile playing noobs. pc master race ftw

14887,"I first started playing WOT on my iPad, but after about 10000 games I realised the game was not as well refined as others, it was full of bugs and with subsequent updates became slower, less responsive and less accurate. I gave the game 1 star on the App store. I then decided to try WOT on Steam, needless to say the ping rates trippled in comparison to the iPad version, which is, well... worse. 

I dont want to lie, so this game SUCKS!

100% Pathetic Game"

14902,"Even tho i didnt play it as much i loved it i really approve it !
If you like tanks and customising ur tanks this game is for you"
14903,"it is a very good  game although i think that tanks with high single shot damage such as the IS or the KV-2  on their AP rounds should have the chance of ....... when you hit the enemy's track by mistake for example, there would be a chance of hitting the tank too due to the pieces of metal when the shell hits the tank the small pieces could be able to penetrate the hull and deal at least 25%-45% of the damage"

14923,"I've Played somewhere around 2.000 battles in - ( May just call it the original WoT ) and I can't say I'm too disapointed with this one... The system requirements are really low and the casual way the battles play out seems pretty suitable for just ""a 
quick game"" maybe before school / work.

  There could of course be more vehicles and maps in the game, but I would say it still makes a decent ""little brother"" of the original WoT.

  Now despite what the hardware requirements say, the game ran pretty much flawlessly on a 1.80Ghz single core cpu, 3GB of RAM and a 1GB graphics card, getting 58-60 FPS almost the whole time using the highest preset and no AA.

  And to people talking about some ""horrendous paywalls"".. you can actually claim a premium account for a couple of days for FREE. I currently have an IS (tier VII), a Matilda (IV) and an SU-85B (tier IV) and a couple of lower tier tanks that don't really matter and I've played 70 hours so far, where in the original WoT you would probably be still stuck at some tier 3-4 without a premium account.

 Also you don't lose credits by playing the heavy tanks as in WoT i actually wasn't able to pay for the repair + ammo resupply costs thus resulting in having to sell my IS and go back to low tier tanks just to be able to still play the game. Of course you could just pay some real money to get back into the game, but that sort of becomes a damn ""Pay2Play"", which is not suppossed to be happening in a free game.
 
 Now you would be right saying that I was probably an avarege or even bellow averege player, but I had decent performance in every battle butI always gained around 2-10k credits for a win and lost around 20-30k for a battle that you lost - now mind that I wasn't using nothing but a gun rammer to reduce the loading time to I think somewhere decent. And that obviously isn't going to result in any huge profit in a longrun.

I would recommend you playing the original WoT though, Its better in many ways for players that are actually into the game and want to improve."
14924,"The PC Version of World of Tanks is better, but play this if you play on a mobile device"

1.The matchmaking is not so good . Why ? Because I enter in game with a tier 5 tank , and in the game are tier 6 , that doesn't make any sense .
2. And don't add those non-sense tanks , like Helsing and other futuristic shit tanks . Make this game a WW1-WW2 military tank game , not futuristic shit like COD .
3. Add maps from the World of Tanks original game .

In rest the game is good , keep at the good work ! :D :)"

14950,"New tanks are Pay to WIn, and they are filing Copyright Strikes agains people trying to show it on youtube."
14951,"Take World of Tanks, nerf every single tank to ridiculous levels (6 seconds aiming time in some tier 3/4 tanks???), then find ways to make the mostly brainless community of Android/IOS players pay right and left. I know the equipment change just happened but I found it amazingly stupid, the first level equipment especially is mostly irrelevant. Then you'll have to choose between cammo or increased range vision types of options. I've seen explanations of WG for the logic behind the new system but is all a fallacy. They say ""now you'll have to ponder the pros and cons of having x or y equipment"", nonsense, they mostly made it a non-choice by giving binary options and from what I've seen so far tying specific equipment to specific tanks, so no no real choice there. I've seen the news, the discussions, the rage in forums, and by the way I haven't found a way to get to the forum from the main game site (probably WG doesn't want the players discussing the changes and obvious money grabs anymore?).
Anyway, if something like this was to happen in the PC version, the game would be shutdown in a matter of weeks.
WG I've always agreed with most of what you done with the PC version and your vision about what a free to play game should be but I'm disgusted with what you did to blitz. I hope the brain damaged person behind this stays away from the PC."

EVERYTHING is now a cash grab. Tanks you owned were nerfed, premium tanks included. Equipment you paid for was taken and replaced with a significantly more complex system of equipment and the system of credits to buy this equipment and grind tanks makes sure you will spend many many long frustrating weeks and months getting it up to competetive levels. When you sell that tank to go the next level up, you have to start the whole process over again. Oh did I mention the timers that make you wait upwards of three days waiting for that equipmment to become available? Lets not even get into the long term bugs affecting game play that have been ignored since 2015..."

If your answer is no then please do not play this and lets say the community is really I mean really really bad for real the player base is like lets say you won a game then you'd be happy right? but what if I tell ya that when the enemies willing to write you mean words even make whole new acc. to stalk you."

Actually I can only think of the above pro. Would recommend PC WOT instead of WOTB. Try it out if you want to compare the differences between WOT and WOTB. Don't play if you want a decent tank-simulator experience. The PC version got insane 252U, SPG and so on but is still better than WOTB overall in my opinion."
14968,nice
14969,Awesome game to pass the time. fairly well balanced but PC players do have a large advantage over tablet players which can be very annoying for mobile players.
14970,"this game is very good

if there's no brainless players in this game"
14971,"This game used to thrive because there was a mutual understanding between the players and the developers. When you spent money they treated you right, they courted you for keeping their lights on. It was understood that you were a paying customer and that was appreciated. Since their 3.8 update (and a little before, actually), they've ceased to show a smidgen of respect to the playerbase and taken to try and force money from the hands of paying players. I can't even imagine the kind of discomfort experienced by those playing for free. I weep for them. If you take anything away from this review, it's this :[b]THIS IS NOT A FREE-TO-PLAY GAME ANYMORE[/b]. Free to get robbed and struggle through impossibly long grind periods (We're talking months for [i]very[/i] little reward)? Sure. 

Update 3.8 brought a change to the equipment that one can load onto their tanks. Keep in mind that the difference between a fully equipped tank and stock tank is night and day. It takes that equipment to play it to its full potential. Pre-3.8 veterans, myself included, had hundreds of tanks that were fully equipped. That took hundreds of hours of gameplay to do. When they announced 3.8 they told us outright that we were going to be short-changed: we'd recieve 1/8th of the equipment we had before. Imagine that. You'd think that they'd do the very obviously fair thing and make the conversion 1 to 1 (nope). Now those of us with garages full of tanks only get to fully equip a handfull at best and the rest is locked away behind timers that take days and grinds that'll take [i]years[/i]. Again, I have to say this so you don't get the wrong impression: if the veterans are getting robbed, the ""free-to-play"" newcomers are at a huge disadvantage. It's in everyone's interest to hold these devs accountable.

This is simply extortion. They want you to spill some cash for gold so you can play the tanks you already worked to equip. Ridiculous. There's been an exodus of players and thread upon thread of complaints on the forums but the devs don't listen. Check their t-shirt reviews on Amazon and their ratings on the Apple store. The devs just nailed the lid on their coffin and unless they make some serious, non-cash-grabby changes, they're going to kill their own game. As it stands this game is not playable and absolutely not worth spending any money on. Heed the bad reviews and remember that the Russians (devs) have bots working to try and skew how badly their game has tanked with fake reviews.

[b]Devs: Repeal 3.8 and give us back our hard-earned equipment.
Prospective players: play if you'd like but never, ever spend money here. They'll nullify your purchases in a heartbeat and not give a care in the world about you.[/b]


edit: if you choose not to believe me, go look a the other reviewers. Mind you that the only relevant ones are from May onward. That's when this 3.8 fiasco happened.


[b]UPDATE: 5/25/2017 --UPDATE 3.9--[/b]

Still no fix for the equipment system they implemented and they've instead added a rating system that's pretty useless. It limits the amount of votes you can give other players on their behavior/performance in-game to 3 per day. That's useless and it'll let people get away with still being ignoramuses. League has a similar honor system that WG could easily model but they've decided to side with the trolls who cry on the forums about imaginary ""abuse"". They just want to be able to call people everything under the sun without consequence. The new American line looks unappealing and I wouldn't bother grinding it myself. They nerfed premium ammo damage and made it less costly as well. For the time-being I don't see a problem with that, and I spam the stuff when I see red, if that tells you anything. They resold exclusive event tanks in the tech tree and put out some mediocre camo for the IS-6 (it's terrible and suuuper low-res, I've made my own mod camo that's higher quality). They're nullifying the work the people who ground the event tanks put in after every update and it's just sick to watch them take people's money and then stab them in the back. Don't play the game and if you do, know that developers aren't loyal to the playerbase and have made strides to silence people who speak out against them via YouTube.



[b]UPDATE: 6/20/2017 --UPDATE 3.10--[/b]


The game remains in an unplayable state. Wargaming is frantically selling over-powered, formerly ""exclusive"" tanks at exorbitant prices to try and slow the bleeding from 3.8. They're going to be releasing another crate-gamble event soon to try and recoup their losses because of how successful the last one was. Meanwhile, long-time players and collectors have boycotted them into the red. They went as far as replacing an in-game consumable--adrenaline--with ""ToRnAdO eNeRgY"". The image that replaced it was a Tornado Energy Drink can. They've been hemorrhaging money so much that they've turned basic game mechanics into advertising space. With this update, they tried to fix the 3.8 equipment fiasco but have really only worsened the rate at which equipment can be acquired. Previously, one could expect about 200 or so spare parts from a good tier 8 victory. From a loss at the same tier, you'd still net 100 spare parts, at least. Now, they've reduced it so that you only receive parts every time you get a medal in a match, and never during losses (even if you carry and get many medals). The number of parts rewarded per medal varies drastically and they really only give a decent amount to Mastery medals, which caps at 1k medals for a tier 10 mastery. I'm at about 54% WR right now and I can tell you that they are not easy to get regularly and if you take into account the fact that a piece of tier 10 equipment will run you nearly 30k parts, that's not realistic. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class medals receive negligible amounts by comparison. 

Also during this update, they released more mediocre copy-camo that they repainted and re-released again. The skins are large, splotchy, and childish. I make my own skins (you can mod) for this game and it amazes me that they can't put out quality, mature work. I've never held a paid design job in my life and I do better than they do. It's almost embarrassing to just look at them.

Another thing they've done: to try and placate people they're handing out boosters like candy. Mind you, boosters don't cost them a thing and they're relatively useless. What the people need are spare parts and proper tank balancing. It's ridiculous how the developers play deaf when people tell them that they have literally one mistake to fix: give people the old equipment system back or GIVE THEM SPARE PARTS VIA A REASONABLE MEANS AND IN REASONABLE NUMBERS. Jesus FUCKING Christ. It wouldn't be so hard to understand if they weren't such a grubby bunch of corrupt Russian imbeciles. They're after profit and they don't even know how to get it. 
 
[b]SUMMARY:[/b] 
At this rate, the game will die out. Paying customers, like myself, are holding onto our money until they start compensating players fairly. It's a very sad, stagnant time for this game and I'd advise newcomers to look elsewhere for tank gameplay. Try War Thunder instead. At the very least you'll have an actual game to play in a few years. This game is veering hard into the mobile market where it wants to become the next Clash of Clans. It won't be able to and that'll be the end of it. It'll just be a terrible game with over-priced micro-transactions like many others. Stay away.




5.0 Edit:

Ranked battles are underwhelming. Idiots still find their way into the highest tiers and ruin games. The new set of French TD's are just more things to shoot at, they're nothing special and the idiots who grind them usually just weigh down teams in the early tiers. In high tiers they're the typical French tank with paper armor. The new chests only subsidize the loss of credits when playing the aforementioned ""ranked"" battles. There's no skill in skill-based atm."
14972,"While the new equipment system is a total drag, I still find this game to be a lot of fun. I will continue to play this game for fun in my spare time and hope that future updates will take a turn back into the right direction. This biggest downfall for WarGaming is thier refusal to acknowledge player feedback. Fun game from an ""I know better than you"" corporation."
14973,"Well, I've played and enjoyed the game thoroughly on iOS, Android and Steam. Like some of the curators say, it's a mobile game ported to Steam, so much lighter than the full WoT. That's not a bad thing, though, if all you want is a fast-paced tank battle without too much complex grinding. However, the release of update 3.8 has added a whole new level of complexity that is of no benefit to gameplay, and basically detrimental to the game as a whole. 
Hence the downvote. I will keep playing, but my wallet is locked."
14974,Hey can we make our own maps?
14975,Great alternative for players who don't have a PC to play World of Tanks.
14976,"I spent alot of time in WOT, and its fucking boring :D."
14977,YES
14978,"Well after 600 hours of play, and 3,300 games played, time to uninstall. I came to this game from World of Tanks the original game, and enjoyed the ""lite"" version and the ability to play a similar game on my laptop, tablet, or even phone. Had most of the tanks, similar maps, controls etc. Spent a couple of hundred dollars over the years of play, ground my way to pretty much all vehicles up to tier 7, have 50 odd tanks, and 7 premiums......then 3.8 came along.
All the equipment I had for those vehicles gone, and a lot of grinding and/or real world money needed to get  back? No thanks. I would rather sink money into a game where when you spend it you get to keep it.
I sat back and looked, from the opening screen which wants to sell you stuff, to pretty much anywhere on the garage screen you click cries out ""spend here"" to be better/faster/get more. The money grab is over Wargaming.
"
14979,"I revise my opinion from bad game to good game, even thought this one is still bad game (from the bad server matchmaking and the unbalance matchmaking tier).

The game is still same from the first time i play it, what makes me think this becoming a good game is because the tanks are great and with the updated content, it's getting more lively. When i still young, i was thought this game bad because the bad matchmaking, broken stats of tanks, and unfriendly player. But after several years of hiatus, i took this game again and play again, and now i know the feels of becoming ""old"". 

It's still the same game, same player attitude, bad server and matchmaking, but with the matchmaking got updated to only up to 1 tier above show up on every battle it help but not that helpful (imagine using tier 3 smoll chunky tank with watergun met up tier 4 matilda, and not 1 and not 2, but 3 matildas, i was like ""this is fine"" while getting fires surround me), well at least it's not the same way back then that you can met up with 2 tier above you and getting ass kicked because different calibre of guns and armour. Also there's not enough bot on the battle, making below tier 5 (especialy tier 3 down to 1)always realy long waiting up to 6-10 minutes only to play 2 minute of battle because theres not enough bot that fill up the gap. Also many player did said, the matchmaking is based on your rating/battle ratio (i'm still not convinced since there's no official said it but i kinda accept those logic, if it true then this game still sucks like back then), well since i still played between tier 5-1, of course my ratio is not that good since i always met the ""bad player"" or ""worst player"" along the way, i can said, its sucks, people said it's your own fault for that bad ratio, but what about those pesky ""bad player"" that caused you being dragged to bad ratio, they're not at fault? that's why i said, it's still the same player attitude of being a cun't.

but anyway, the game still pretty good to played alone and try to immerse into the fast pace WW tank combats while using the strategic movement (ex: blitzkrieg/tactical maneuvert/flanking, etc). best play if you got bored of many game like i do, so i play this game, and i got hooked play it, but it's getting bored again, so i'm gonna leave this game again, until i got bored the other game i played and come back play this game."
14980,4/10
14981,"Edit: I see many players giving a downvote. I agree with them. But this is a free game you can try. if you dont like it , you can get the pc version.

(This is a nice port. But,  I think this game must balance some of the tanks. here is an example.)

I play the pc ver. of world of tanks.

I decided to check this out.

Today, I saw i never touched the russian tank.


I gave the tier 1 a spin

ande also if your wondering like i did whats the main diffrence between world of tanks normal and world of tanks blitz yea the menus on blitz are more user friendly but your missing 1 of the most important armed vechiles which u get in world of tanks BLITZ has NO ARTILLERY WHATSO EVER  big thumbs down

and before anyone says its a tank game there shoudnt be artillery what is a tank its a heavily armoured vechile with powerful guns what is artillery slighty less armoued vechiles with stupidly big guns and also remeber its in world of tanks original game so why that game not this waiting for oh u cant run about in an artilley vechile well to that i say who says i cant"
14988,"Why oh why did wargaming decide to put a mobile game onto steam. The graphics are crap, the gameplay is bearable (just) and game time is too short. The only thing this game has going in its favour is that it's easier to grind each tank than on the pc. Otherwise it's a waste of hard drive space. Should have put the PC version on here wargaming, just saying."
14989,"The game I once cherished is now gone, hidden deep beyond a Real Money Paywall and 21 day timer.

[h1]The Game[/h1]
[b]The game used to great and still is, Wargaming Ltd. or WG have muffed it up so badly that many veteran players and those who have spent hundreds to thousands of dollars have either quit or entered hibernation.
I myself own 3 Tier X tanks, a T62A, Obj. 268 and IS-7. It took me a lot of time and money and to get me to where I am. Now they release 'seasons' or whatever and its a complete grindfest to achieve some currency.

The core game is fantastic, basically its not just look at him and he's dead but armour does indeed play a role. That is until Random Number Generators kick in. LEGIT EVERYTHING that the game offers you is RNG! The Credits, Penetration, Matchmaking, spare parts. There were times were I stole victory from within the confines of the enemy. 
The Devs also didn't reimburse/compensate us properly! This have lead many to boycott this game.

TL:DR Don't download because the devs will screw you over and will NOT rollback. The game is great but their no rollback update policy and excessive grindfest and microtransactions have pushed the game to a new low.

4/10 will return in 6 months and will revaluate."
14990,"This game is pretty cool,from the start you have premium 2 days.After that,you get good upgrades for your tanks.This game is cool. 10/10 for everything"
14991,"Once again greedy thieving vermin rob people with ""game updates"".NEVER invest a dollar with these douchbags.10 thumbs down."
14992,"Do NOT download this game. That's right, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Unless you want excruciating grinding and horrendous paywalls, I suggest you move on to another game. I have spent 100's of dollars fully updating my 25 tanks, now with the new patch I have 3 tanks updated!
These folks screwed everyone over for a money grab.
F'em"
14993,3.8 is a money grab

14995,Love the realness of this game. It Rocks!!!
14996,"The latest update to this game has moved the game further and further from a free to play to a pay to play typical app game. This belongs in a pile of other generic games with constant incentives to have to pay out of pocket to make any progress, even things you owned before the update."

awsome game plz add teir 11"
15000,"Update 3.8 is the worst piece of garbage.  Thanks Wargaming for stealing equipment we paid for, giving us back only enough spare parts to fully equip a tiny fraction of our tanks and having the audacity to call it an improvement.

"
15001,"Update 3.8 ruined the game. Timers and the new equipment make players grind new currency to equip tanks again. New players will also suffer a lot, as the equipment costs way too much and older players will have their premiums fully equipped already."
15002,"DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME
The last (3.8) patch made the game a piece of sh... Now you have to pay to be able to stand against the other players... Or you can wait a lot of days (1 to 24) to unlock the realy important equipment."

Game lost automatickly my upgrades and dont give back cash."
15004,(っ˘ڡ˘ς)
15005,"Game is going pay to win FAST. They are 1) increasing the number of things you have to grind to be competitive, 2) offering cash as pretty much the only way out if you don't want to grind until your brain melts, and 3) introducing more and more OP pay tanks that will never get balanced as a policy. Still a fun game, but beware."
15006,"Good, fun game.  Game Forum admins are a bit ret.. childish."
15007,"As of patch 3.8 I can no longer recommend this game. 3.8 fundamentally changed how the unlock system works by attempting to apply city-building-style monetization to the game.  It is no longer the case that after spending a few hours grinding one tank, you will have fully upgraded it, allowing you to be on an even playing field with other players.  Instead, it now takes about 300+ hours to collect enough of the new ""scrap"" currency to fully upgrade a tank.  This game was the only F2P game I ever spent money on, precisely because it was NOT pay-to-win.  3.8 has now changed that, which is something I cannot support."
15008,Absolutely Brlliant!
15009,ruined my clan and updated the game badly in same day
15010,"The idea behind the new equipment I'm a big fan of. It brings a lot more diversity and customization to what was essentially a carbon copy equipment setup of WoT PC. 

But the compensation in the changeover was abysmal. Only a 50% chance spare parts drop after each battle, which ends up feeling more like 35%-40%. I do not understand why any wait timer, for any tier of equipment for any tier of a tank needs to be longer than 12hr. It's a giant buzzkill to what should be an exciting experience unlocking a new piece of equipment. 

This game is still very fun, I enjoy it's simplified and refined mechanics more than the PC version. But this is just a very, very poorly executed update. If you're debating on whether to download Blitz, I would very strongly recommend you wait until the next update."
15011,Just play the original version.
15012,I LOVE THIS GAME. im still trying to get wot but blitzs is just as well awsome as world of tanks is five stars to I LOVED IT.
15013,Game can definitely be cash grabby at times. Game devs don't listen to the community that much i  think. Still a good game though and most of the community is nice.
15014,Great game till they completed screwed us on the last update. Hours and hours and hours of grinding gone.
15015,"Since update 3.8 this game has become PAY TO WIN.  Equipment that enhances your tank are now locked behind timers, gold and spare parts.  Yeah this game used to be good but those days are long gone.  Instead of creating new content like new maps and tanks the devs regurgitate already existing features and attach timers, gold or tickets to them.  These last two updates have gotten worse and worse.  Game is broken and dead.  Time to delete and move on."
15016,R.I.P. 04.05.2017
15017,"Fantastic game, ruined by a greedy developer.

Here's the problem. I've spent time and money on this game and the developer just took away almost everything I invested in one update. Please read carefully and BE WARNED.

I was just in-game looking at one of my favourite tanks. It's a tier 8 premium. Premium meaning I spent enough REAL MONEY on this one tank to buy a full console game for example. Seems crazy but I really like this game. And I like this tank so much that I spent even more real money on a fancy paint job, just to make it look pretty. But I'm just looking at it, not playing it because my tank has been robbed.

I've been driving this tank for awhile now, FULLY EQUIPPED and able to go head-to-head against any other tank on a level playing field. And this is not the only tank I've spent money on. Some players spend hundreds even thousands of $$$ on this game. But it's genuinely a great game and few of us regretted it until....

....update 3.8 happened. My tank. ALL my tanks have been robbed of their equipment.

Under the guise of improving the equipment system (which was in no way broken) they have taken away all my equipment, paid for in game currency. To re-equip my tank for peak performance I have to wait for newly-imposed TIMERS to run out which will take MOST OF A MONTH! Or, I can pay even more REAL MONEY to get it now. Don't forget I already paid plenty REAL MONEY for this tank and now they're asking for more, just to get back what I had already.

Sounds awful right? But this is not even the worst part. I have a garage full of tanks, we all do. And this update has taken away 100% of our equipment on all tanks and gave us enough compensation (in the form of a brand new alternative currency) to buy only 12% back. Yes, we did the math.

To get the rest back we need to grind all over again, and again we did the math. It will take ACTUAL YEARS for many players to recover what they ALREADY EARNED but was taken away. In extreme cases, up to a decade.

The more TIME and MONEY you invest in this game is more that the developer can take away from you at any time. That is the bottom line here. So think carefully before playing this game and especially before you spend money on it."
15018,Gas has descended into Money Grabbing Pay to Win crap.
15019,"WG staff does not care about the opinions of its players. Prior to Update 3.8 players in the masses, expressed their opinions and concerns for the new equpment system. WG staff did not fully explain this new system prior to release saying they did not have the information for it. This new update made players tanks go from fully equipped and maxed out to basically stock tanks again. 

Players need to have ""spare parts"" In order to use the new equipment system that was implemented. The problem is that WG did not give players an adequate amount of ""Spare Parts"" in order for players to fully utilize their tanks that they had previously maxed out on.

To new/interested players: Do not play this game unless update 3.8 is revoked."
15020,just dont download 3.8 killed entire game
15021,"3.8 has killed the game. I have been playing blitz for 2 years now and all the time i spent on grinding the tanks is wasted. The spare parts that we have recieved for that 2 year grind is nothing when compaired to the vast amount of tanks in my garage. And the timers? I came here to play tanks, not farmville.

It's not worth it anymore, so don't bother."
15022,"Be ready to to take out your wallet if you want to have fun in this game, otherwise the grind will make you want to commit Seppuku. If EA made a free to play tank game, this would be it.

15032,"This game is plagued by the same issue that most MOBAs are. The playerbase is frustratingly bad. There are some other major issues I'll get to but first and foremost this game is frustrating primarily because you can and will run into people who have somehow managed to find a way to trip and fall into higher tier games without actually learning how to play the game from a team based perspective. The lack of any solo play whatsoever makes the game needlessly frustrating once you get to the higher tiers, as you find yourself on teams with people who either don't play their tanks right, or don't do team play.
Now allow me to elaborate on the other parts that make this game frustrating as hell. You have Wargaming, whose lack of common sense and poor customer handling skills mean that really any issues you come accross will either be ignored or mocked. Update 3.8 is a prime example. The Developers basically said they thouught they made a good equipment system. The user base disagreed vehemently and provided data to show that the developers' claims were wrong (which is dangerous because that means they could potentially be sued for false advertising). 
Secondly, is the poor balancing of tanks for the game itself. Given how small the maps are, Tank Destroyers are basically an exercise in persistence as your teammates will often not try and bait the enemy team around corners so that you can shoot them. That means you need to get up close and personal and honestly, TD do not have the armor to pull that off. Camo is fundamentally useless as the view range is so small, and the tanks so fast, that applying camo and using camo is only truly effective on a small number of vehicles. 
Thirdly is the lack of features overall. With only two game modes and an equipment system so costly and time consuming everyone would walk away from it, games quickly become stagnated and the game itself devolves into a battle of samey tanks playing poorly. 
My advice to Wargaming is to hire on a consultant to teach you how to interact properly with your customers. Hell I'll do it for you.
My advice to the players who are thinking of picking this up is to take your time and think about how you want to engage players. Read some guides, talk to players with high win rates, watch videos. All of that will help the game become a more enjoyable experience overall.
*Edit after 3.9 update.
The spare parts system is still just as pointless as it was in 3.8 and overall the move has caused a hollowing out of the playerbase. The 'military honor' system is kinda dumb as its limited to only a set few reviews every day instead of unlimited. It is also too easy to negatively affect other players with complaints that may not be justified."
15033,"This game is my ALL TIME FAVORITE! I love to play this game when I have nothing else to play and it always gives me the same amount of fun and action that I am looking for. Even if you are new to the game, you can pick it up quickly with it's very easy control system and you will be 'tanking' the developers for this awesome game!"
15034,very good game
15035,nice and easy to play game
15036,"Play this game for 3-days due to the free 3-day premium and then get rid of it from your Steam library. The entire game is based around premium features such as premium ammo/premium consumables and buying your way to the top. Converting free money to premium ammo is non-sustainable even if you do win with top-gun and 10 other medals and starting off with free crew is just asking to be farmed for 100 games because 50% crews are so blind that they can't even see a tank in front of them even if they are 100 meters in front of you in plain-sight and no camo bonus.

When you do get to the top, you will eventually realize that the only reason you put so much effort into this tiering-up is because you wanted to play a game where players have a even advantage but you end up realizing that high-tier games is exclusively for wallet warriors."

15042,"Nice, Fast Paced and short queue imported mobile game, I've played all three WarGaming games (Land/Air/Sea) and I've loved this little brother with simple menus, quick fighting and good compatibility with other OS's despite is mobile origins.  Well done"
15043,After upcoming update you won't be doing anything without gold and real money...
15044,"ARMY Tanks!



good!

"
15045,RECOMMEND IT
15046,"I would recommend anyone considering downloading and playing this version of the World of Tank franchise consider playing the full PC game, and avoiding this blatant cash grab app.

Not only does this title suffer from being a port from a mobile based game, it also suffers from the usual $$$ to win model that is the cancer of mobile titles that claim to be ""free"".

In their most recent update, Wargaming has introduced timers (which you can skip for real world cash) as well as a system of upgrades that relies on over 200-300 fights per level.  

If you want to play the arcade WoT style, download the full PC version.  If not I would direct you to the War Thunder game as well as Armored Warfare as alternatives that are not out to take as much $$$$$$ as possible from you in the shortest time.

AVOID THIS TITLE!!! WARGAMING HAVE TURNED IT INTO A $$$$$ TO WIN."
15047,noob game cant party 3 idiot
15048,"Great game. Play it daily. If you are having a hard time, search bushka on YouTube. He really helps learn the basics and advanced strategies."
15049,"Edit: For a free game, world of tanks is a lot of fun. No transactions are really required and there isn't a paywall to prevent those who didn't pay anything from being competitive. That being said, you will have a tough time if you don't shovel a few dollars into the game every once and a while because of the way the game is designed. A lot of premium tanks that you buy with the special currency are game breaking and you will find towards upper tiers that are tanks that will require you to spend the premium currency on ammo just to piece certain tanks weak spots. 
Occasionally, competition can be annoying when your team doesn't really care or one of the players on your team go AFK on you. There is also a lot of grinding after a certain tier which can be frustrating when you've had a long lose streaks. If you don't like ginding by yourself the best way to play this game is to drag in a few friends with you. 
The moment I started learning from my mistakes and started grinding with friends, my gameplay got a lot better and I started enjoying myself more. 
Great game for its price!"
15050,mostly good
15051,"Great game 

"
15052,its a good game but i dont know why they ported the mobile app to steam instead of using the already available HD launcher from wargamings site. still recomended
15053,"Why did you get this game? World of tanks is also free and it's much better in terms of balance, graphics, gameplay, getting good updates, and basically everything else.

this is literaly a mobile port of world of tanks that was ported back to pc for some stupid reason. just get the original version.

but really why did you even think about getting this game?"
15054,"Can you please remove the spare parts thing because it's really annoying? i've had some good time with this game but now it's ruined and not fun anymore because of stupid french tank destroyers and that spare parts system, why wargaming always have to make things worse when the overall game is actually pretty good?"
15055,Mainly well balanced. Gameplay is usually pretty fun especially with custom gamemodes. The main problem is the community surrounding it. But you really get used to it. 8/10
15056,World of Tanks Blitz is a very fun tanks game 10/10 :)))
15057,"imagine a faster/shorter/ easier version of WoT pc? this is it.In some senses, this game is better than the PC one. quicker matches, faster matches being started are some. also, it isnt a pay2win. however at higher tiers, having a premium tanks helps a lot. this game is definitely enjoyable overall"
15058,"""Please god, find us another target!""

8/10 Good fun and easy free play progression."
15059,It's alright if you are into tank warfare
15060,just play the good version... Warthunder
15061,10/10 best gem
15062,small size but perfect game!
15063,Fun game... Customer Service is great...  I have alot of hours into this and enjoy it very much... Wish the maps were bigger and more time for battles but otherwise great game for me....
15064,PLEASE PLEASE NO! i love world of tanks but world of tanks blitz is a bad game i looks like shit it is possible to get enough gold to buy a premium just by doing the fucking tutorial all the player are retarded you should thank me for going to this hell so you don't have too this is a free to play game that is trying too hard too get your money overall a 2/10
15065,"This game is so bad....
...it was good but wargaming screwd it once it becamed available on steam. WICH IS ABSOLTTE BULLSHIT. By playing this game on steam you are getting so much of advatages above android/os gamers. sure they can disable playing w/ players playing on steam but most of them dont now about it. here are some cons:
-walls are glued
-meds are stupidly better than everythik else, cuz their speed is alowing to do anythink what situation needs. Explain:
When your team gets 4-5 heavy tanks, you can go only to urban areas, 1 med is ussless, two can do somethink, but when you have  special TDs (british lines, german second line) you are basicly screwd beacase you need: A, covering
                                                                                                                                                                             B, spotting
wich when you have 5 heavy tanks, you cant provide.
BUT here is BIG CATCH, when opponet team consists of 5-6 meds, you can just rush to open areas (you are not supporting one player but that doesent matter, its frustrating when its like nashorn, that can do a LOT of damage, but you cant let him travel last, and he is qite slow) when they have ONE less med there you just crush them, you are moving so its very hard to hit you for TDs in range( fast are dead, slow are too away to hit you) and basicly now if they have 5 heavy tanks, in urban a. you can kite them, separete and kill, go for cap bait, options are endless.
in conclusion: in WOT series Meds were allways able to adapt sitiution, but in BLITZ their adaptaion is WAY TO GOOD.
-WG hates TD that were ment to snipe
-light tanks are sometimes better then meds (in good platoons), their MM is nonsence on lower tiers...(VK 28.01 yeeeah, definitely not STRONG and BETTER than any med on that tier....)
-comunity is SO BAD
-players usualy look like (in game): A, 6 year old kids
                                                          B, drunken idiot
                                                          C, Im everything BUT NOT TEAMPLAYER
-maps are too simple and uncomplex
-super wierd crew skills
-game mods are too same
-contorols are even on PC goofy
- NO CHAT AFTER YOU DIE
Now for good thinks:
+If you are a evil person, there is a LOT of SEALCLUBING and OP tanks, and good platoons are making SUPER EZ WIN
+Its dynamic....                        ....a lot more than regular WOT, but imagine: NASHORN, tier 6 battle, you can do a LOT of damage... ...your team are buch of idiots and they are rushing... ....so you rush too....with no hope to snipe so damage....you qicky become prey to enemy meds that run to your back and killed you totaly...your team loses and you have highest damege with 900...regular game with nashorn
+qite a lot of tanks, you can chose your playstyle, BUT some lines are in current med meta usseless
+If you hate snipers, this game is for you, cuz tthere are sniper tanks but they dont work
+In well cooperatied platoons (skype, TSC3) you can change everythink. Even play sniper or solo heavy
+Finances are so uch easyeir than in regular WOT, you can afford to troll in T8

AND THAT IS ALL I CAN REMEBER, DONT LOOK AT MY HOURS IN GAME, I have played a lot at android
DONT PLAY THIS, DONT SUPPORT THIS, ITS A BAD GAME...
....But it can be fixed"
15066,"Basically this ahistorical game is good clean fun! Controls are fair, and its basically a simple shoot eem up pay to win game. Its fun, you dont have to spend a lot f $ but can with a few dollars have a good laugh. Dont take it seriously, because its nt historical in any way at all.

Although the game mechanism is childish and primitive - its still a simple fun game. BANG BANG you're dead.

Most displeasing feature: MAX PLATOONS OF TWO MEMBERS - Incredibly stupid and will prevent most of my friends spending more than a couple of hours playing it. I can nt believe that anyone would build a modern day piece of gaming software, where TWO not three or more can play together.....Unbelievably ....D U M B!"
15067,"Pay to win.

Why try hard when you can just buy your way to the top."
15068,ty
15069,Good and fun game. Maybe u you should add easier missions to earn more gold in the game because it's very hard to earn gold.
15070,"Basically the mobile (terrible) version of WoT, it's better to just get the normal WoT."
15071,"I love the game but now its laggy, its about Steam, it works in mobile but its laggy is Steam. It shows i have 40 ping when i really have like 900, enemies teleport and reload stops at 0,1 sec for 3 seconds. Please fix these bugs, i love this game too much to go back to War Thunder or World Of Tanks (PC version)"
15072,can you add more platoon players like reguler WOT
15073,I know this game was made for the phone but still it bad to play on PC!!!. god why would WG put this in steam and not the real world of tank....
15074,"Соо1!
"
15075,"Good Game
"
15076,Well Blanced MM from WG
15077,"Tanks, tanks and more tanks. Well of course there is, its the World of Tanks!

A good solid game all round.

Graphics and frame rates are all good, no in game lag or glitchies.

Highly detailed tech tree, with ok progression rates. You're not gonna have a top tank from the word go but in my opinion you progress at a nice steady pace.

Matches are quick to load overall, no more than two minute wait for game.

Relatively fair matching between tank types.


"
15078,"This appears to be a mobile/console game ported over to PC. It certainly plays like a mobile game, it would feel right at home on my droid Turbo 2. That should be enough said if you are looking for any level of decent ""tank combat simulator"" because this is just not it. 

edit: I actually looked this game up after posting this, it literally is a mobile game ported to Steam. 

I have seen some folks mention in their review to skip this and get the full WoT game from their website (also free) but I would say skip both and go for War Thunder. I started playing that game in 2012-2013 and I never played tanks until recently and it took a while to get used to / into it (coming from planes) but now it feels much better and more natural than this game. I downloaded this because I played this game long before tanks on War Thunder and I enjoyed it, but this just does not compare to today's Ground Forces in WT. Can't wait for Naval Forces over there either!!!"
15079,"amazing, played on my phone as well and had a great time and very few if any prolems."
15080,its awesome
15081,Bad graphics boring game play mechanics
15082,"It's a mobile game converted to steam. If you are playing on PC, skip this and head for the 'full' version from Wargaming's website."
15083,"I love this game. I really do. I played WoT and that just didn't fit my gameplay style! This game however is much less tactical and even more arcade than WoT itself. But there is a little issue I would like to address: Please fix matchmaking. Why? Because brawling against 4-5 heavy tanks in the enemy team while you got only one isn't fun. Even if your team plays exceptionally well, chances are low that you can actually win the game. That's the only thing i dislike about WoTB, everything else seems perfectly fine to me.

Edit: Jeez...these weird tanks they add are kinda idiotic"
15084,Just as fun as PC world of tanks but the games are a lot faster.  Closer ranges make the Russian 122mm cannon less prone to missing and you don't have to hold still quite as long.  Faster games earn more xp and a smaller tech tree lets you get higher tier tanks with less time.
15085,mehh
15086,"Awesome game for Tank lovers & also for those who will eventually fall in love with Tanks once they play this game...

You can say its like a Counter Strike like game but of tanks...

Its a blitz version of the original World of Tanks game (PC) 

Its highly addictive gameplay keeps you engrossed in it for hours & hours...apart from the grinding of the tanks across 10 tiers, nations & different tank types...

The game is very deep with the easiest of controls ever....
Every time you play the game, its feels exciting...to get the next tank...

Only con is the prices of the premium tanks being exhorbitantly high...(although having a premium tank gives you no added advantage except higher xp & higher credits)

I would definitely recommend this game to every action / shooting / Multiplayer genre game lovers...

Awesome game

Cheers

""Sting them"" (popular commentary in game) ;D"
15087,"its amzing game for me from last 5 years not only in steam i play this game from y iphone and its really great 



hope this game come to steam 
1) world of tank
2) world of warship
3) world of warplanes


"
15088,"It was a good game, but every update will make this game more like shit."
15089,Absolutly horrible its a crap mobile copy of wot ported back on to pc
15090,A shitty PC port of a shitty mobile port of a shitty PC game with rigged matchmaking and pay-to-win bullshit.
15091,Blitz is Fast pace and fun to play perfect for on the go or just relaxing at home
15092,this game is freaking unflipingfair dude when the emeny hit me they be in invisable.and also THE M4 SUCK ITS MISS EVERYTIME
15093,"When I first discovered it a month ago, I loved Blitz, but with the new update it sucks. 
Others have already covered the money issues, like payed for items that were removed in the update. 

I personally didn't have a lot of money invested  yet, but what pee's me off, is a necessary item for two of my Soviet tanks was completely removed from the equipment lists and from my fully equipped tanks. 
As an example, my Soviet A-20 relied on the +30% suspension durability which is totally removed. You can't drive at high speeds across the battlefield anymore, without breaking the tracks. This is without being shot at. Hit a bump and break a track now...  
The A-20 has no armor to speak of and relies very heavily on speed and driving talent to survive. 
Without the +30% mod in the equipment listing, my A-20 and T-34 are now crippled. Slow driving and no armor with slow loading canons on them, means almost sure death in a short time."
15094,crap
15095,"Shortest review of mine ever i love it but i hate it every second of its ""ping laggin fest""  even more when there is ping so hard that u wanna punch your screen to dust. so i play this game on pc and not on mobile phone and this is a big difference 
when it come to ping optimally when there arent any competition for farming tanks game works properly without wanting to rip your hair from your head cause ping well atleast in my pc is well below 60 and fps is 60  and when i play now where is everybody are trying to get their hands on fremium premium tanks ping is so bad that u better would watch bobs burgers than play this piece of shit when your ping drops dow to 400 or 600 or too 1000 and this is so bad that u cant even hit anyone :D so my recomendation play this game when there are no farming for any new premium fremium class tanks and if u are gonna do it that then its your brains funeral :D yep so my verdict would be 7/10 when it is playable and 1/10 when its not and if u are solo player u better be patient to wait out that storm of farming cuz othervise u will really loose your cool and loose your gaming tool :D"
15096,Its ok
15097,This game is amazing if i need to get mad or anything i would take it out on the tanks.
15098,Very addictive and Fun too .
15099,Oh ja thats very good
15100,"if your device can't play world of tanks,
try this one... mini version of WoT.

available in mobile too."
15101,"Ever Since i downloaded this game i am addicted to it,Whole bunch of tanks and stuffs,Excellent Game and its Mechanis"
15102,"Good gameplay, good Graphic, compatible for low-end pc. Great work Developer"
15103,Heavily Pay2Win based game. Premium gold powered equips have high stat delta against free equips. If you will not continously spend something on this game then your guaranteed to be one-hit killed by more welll endowed players. The full PC WorldofTanks balance is a bit better in that regard as it involves more skill to even out the currency deficiency. Also lags like molasses in the asia server.
15104,"need french autoloaders
"
15105,"i love it
"
15106,its turned into pay2 win
15107,"No, don't bother, just don't waste your time.  

Update 3.8 ruined the whole thing and made it pay to win."
15108,"Take a shit! 
=P
"
15109,Very tank. Boom.
15110,"Vanilla WoT takes quite long time to finish a match, large maps and have a arty that what makes it fun for me on vanilla Wot, what makes it fun in WoT Blitz is it only take like 3 minutes to finish a match sometime, small maps and no arty that what make WoT Blitz fun for me."
15111,"A very nicely done game for the mobile, which as an added bonus supports steam...
It is a decent game with relativly fast grinding tech trees and fast paced tank matches....
would recomend for sure!!"
15112,"It's much better than classic WoT. It's simple, and WITHOUT ARTILLERY!! 
9/10 for me"
15113,"Wargaming why the hell would you put this on Steam and not regular WOT?

On a side note it's a great game, primarily aimed to those who can't run the original game. Graphics are nice for being a mobile port and there's alot of variation in tanks. Wargaming certainly hit the spot on this one. My only complain is the YOLO it players, they most certainly fucked alot of the matches I took part in. 

Fun fast matches with good looking tanks. And you can team up with a friend against those bastards, what else would you want?

"
15114,"has events where you can win tanks but even if your a excellent player rerolling its a scam to take you near winning a tank but actually youl need complete with ""gold"". also its like they hired a chimp to design the wr system, i actually worked it out mathmatically and you need to win 2 percent of battles to advance 1 percent but lose 1 percent of battles loses that percent, total scam to keep long time players playing as they try to better themselves, money grabbing p2w that going to tactically seperate you from some money, pretty sure they use bots to parkbehind you and stop your retreat in the lower levels too, because no-one could possibly be as thick as some of teams youl get"
15115,Great game but Need to fix the delay reloaded of the tanks
15116,"ใครบอกเกมส์นี้สนุก (ผมว่าไม่จริง)
เกมส์เขาดีอยู่นะครับ แค่บอกว่าไม่สนุก เพราะผู้เล่น(บางคน)ทำตัวเป็นอัลธพาล ชอบทักมาด่า พ่อแม่ ด่า ค_ย 
เล่นกันจริงจังมากเหมือนจะไปแข่งระดับโลกชิงเงินรางวัล
ยังไม่พอ ด่ากันยับ จบเกมส์มันจะมีพวกที่เล่นมาก่อนหรือคิดว่ามันเก่งมันจะทักมาด่า 
เล่นมานานแต่ไม่รู้จักแพ้ชนะ ถุยยย คิดว่าทำตัวถ่อยแล้วเท่ ไม่คิดจะให้โอกาสผู้เล่นใหม่หรือไง
ออ อีกอย่างเกมส์ใครตายก่อนคือ คนเก่งนะครับ 0 ดาเมจก็ไม่โดนด่า แต่คนที่ตายสุดท้านคือ noob ยิงเป็นพันก็โดนด่า"
15117,phone game on pc
15118,"This game should stop making racist maps. Why are there typical chinese music on stereotype chinese maps? You know what, why dont you add a fucking chinese head with closed eyes eating a dog and a blackguy dancing while eating a banana and cooking his first white man."
15119,"This game is great for people who love WoT but don't have much time to play.
"
15120,"This is a great game! It is a good game to sit down with and chill out. The variety of tanks is amazing, and there are fantasy tanks mixed in! I, personally find this to be a good game to play. I play with friends on the game regularly, and it increases increases teamwork.

However, if you have a short patience, this may not be a good game for you. When in game, you have no idea whether you are going to get the elite as your teammates, or a package of people who seem as if they have no brain capacity. There is mild cursing, but this can easily be ignored.

Each tank is different, and has it's pros&cons. There is plenty of variety, and it is always interesting to find which tanks are perfect for each player's use. The game can be laggy at some points, and this severly messes with the gameplay. owever, this is being greatly reduced do to some fixes being made."
15121,i had fun
15122,"Get this version if you are a less-P2W fan. This game doesnt have the complicated crew systems, tournament every time, even though the premmo still exists. You can get gold [b]freely[/b] by winning tournaments, yes, free, even though not much. And expects more free tanks cause events aren't that hard and dont take too much time"
15123,"I had World of Tanks before and saw World of Tanks Blitz on Steam, so thought I'd give it a try. World of Tanks was giving me lag issues, and Blitz lighter package might of reduced this or it's just designed better. I once did have another old issue return on me, where the program just closes itself right before a game starts. Overall, Blitz seems to be far more stable and lagless than World of Tanks original. 

For Blitz, I enjoyed the game and it felt a bit more balanced compared to the original. The price system still doesn't seem thought out well and the tier system is also bad. In some games, you may find yourself about useless if lacking the right equipment. Everything else feels improved, although I liked the original more in some ways, but it's not important to go into that in full detail. If I had to chose something I would change first, it would be to remove distance invisibility and remove names/outlines. The driving mechanics doesn't feel realistic either, sudden top speed and sudden stopping, plus the ram damage.  

The only reason I'm not recommending the game is the bot issue. Half the players or more are obvious bots. This can be seen by their unintelligible behavior or simply not moving the entire game unless shot at. It quickly reduces the game’s quality when half your team is on the other side of the field in a ditch looking around in circles. In one case, there was a player that scored 7/7 kills during the round. I click their profile to see 100% victories, so I’m not sure if he was just good and made a new profile or if it was a bot. In the original World of Tanks, bots were easy to report, but I didn’t see a report system for Blitz. This would explain why there are so many useless tanks just sitting around or making poor decisions. 
If bots were removed, I'd recommend it. But after playing for a few days, I'm already tired of having so many useless players laying around."
15124,good
15125,"My first week on WOT Blitz:

-Got some cool tanks
-Killed multiple times for going out in the open
-RealizEd I hate derp guns and premium ammo
-Got myself a couple sweet TDs and use derp guns with premium ammo
-Killed multiple drivers who were dumb enough to go out in the open


9/10 haha I hit your fuel ranks and now you buuuuuuurn"
15126,Why are you playing this terrible version of World of Tanks? Go get the real game.
15127,"If you love tanks, and blowing things up, then this game is most likely up your alley so to speak. I love games like this, the PVP in tanks is what makes this such a fun game to play."
15128,Perfect for slow computers. I love that I can play both on my phone and my Win7 laptop.
15129,"Затянула как для бесплатной , + норм фпс , для слабых компов е*ать как супер"
15130,"Not gonna lie, I love how this is basically OLD WOT from somewhere in 2014-15, with KV-1S on VI tier and with T-50-2, but i kinda hate those events for those non historical tanks, but still pretty good. And there is thing that i love, no fucking arty in here. 11 artyleries / 10"
15131,"Very cool game
Good Job
"
15132,awesome game wastes my time all the time
15133,the none blitz version still better than this!
15134,"T10 and T9 basically unplayable due to missile tanks.
They ""nerfed"" it but there is no possible way to balance missiles.
Tier 9 missile light tank has OP armor.
Spotting mechanics is garbage - invisible ghost tanks shooting right in front of you in plain sight but not getting spotted makes no sense...
Not to mention this game tries very hard to moneygrab you."
15135,"There are a lot of benefits to playing this game. I shall go through them.

1. People rarely use chat in this game, so toxic behavior is low.
2. Games are quick.
3. Most pro players play the non-Blitz version, so you will probably play against more casual players.
4. Ya got tanks.
5. Maps are smaller and easier to learn.
6. I can actually get eliminations in this version! :D"
15136,"If you really hate the artillery in PC version but still want to play wot.
This is for you guys.

Even though the physics isn't as good as PC ver.

10/10 would rage when vs dracula or Helsing again."
15137,ww
15138,Just like World of Tanks but friendlier
15139,"This game is so funny, you can play with different tanks."
15140,you can play it on pc and ur smart phone soo its easy to play the game anyware as long u have internet acces
15141,"I love that game, Amazing Game !!"
15142,"The PC version is much more stressful and messy. 15 v 15, maps are too huge and things are likely to get chaotic. Imagine playing PC version is similar to playing CSGO 10 v 10.

In this version, it is 7 v 7 with all the same basic features, which means everything is much simpler. Tanks still look good, not as ""fabulous"" and ""shiny"" like the PC version but they do look awesome enough. 

I strongly recommend this game to people who want to relax and have fun. Pretty chillin game. The community is not toxic also."
15143,This game sucks (still plays it)
15144,"Y'know honestly the game is fine. Sure you can pay your way to the better tanks, but in the end you can still get gangbanged by an entire team if you aren't careful.

The gameplay is solid and matches are relatively short (5-25 minutes). 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO REPAIR YOUR TANK AFTER EVERY MATCH. So that's nice. You still pay ingame currency for ammo though.
"
15145,game not loding
15146,Fast pace MMO shooter. Not exactly historically accurate on the American line but violent fun for the whole family. 7 of 10
15147,"Why am I never in the red team, they always win :'("
15148,Awesome game for PC when your laptop or desktop can't handle the PC version of World of Tanks. And the controls are much more better then the mobile one. If your laptop or desktop can't handle the PC version of this game and you don't like the controls on  the mobile version I recommend this.
15149,"Blitz is more fun to play than regular World of Tanks. I recommend trying it.

Pros:
- No artillery!
- No (cheat) mods
- Faster battles, less camping
- Everything is simpler - crew training, missions, etc.
- Runs on old or low end PCs

Cons:
- Lower quality graphics
- Fewer maps and tanks
- Many one-sided battles - same as WoT
- Tough grind in the higher tiers
"
15150,gud game i could play as nazi or commie tank very gud
15151,"this hgame start be so shity. WG dont know how to make normal team balance betwine teams, my team is below 50%wr but enemy teamis pro ower 60%wr."
15152,very fun thats all.
15153,"7 vs 7 in little maps where light tanks rule and hevies get rekt.
What a shitty game"
15154,So fun
15155,"Great game, but i wish the devs could fix these things:

Russian bias,
D.W. 2 Too OP,
Unbalanced, sometimes very unbalanced match.

well, i guess that's all.
Overall it's a nice game.
 
"
15156,Small game but Huge fun!
15157,"Not bad at all for a mobile port, but i feel that the games needs more pc based optimization to be fully recommended for everyone.
Its nice to be able to play a game on the pc and then to be able to play it and continue my progress on the mobile / tablet. 
That is an awesome feature!"
15158,I really love the game its soo fun with sooo much difreant tanks i really reccemend checking it out
15159,"Considering technical aspects, World of Tanks is far superior and a true PC game.

- Exclusive full-screen mode (G-Sync compatible);
- Is possible to set refresh-rate (up to 144Hz);
- Can choose video ouput device (play on monitor or TV whenever I want);
- DirectX 11 (vs. DirectX 9 on WoT Blitz), resulting in better resources management, higher frame-rate, SLI scaling, GPU usage;
- Surround sound system support (I use 5.1).


Advantages of WoT Blitz:

- Some exclusive contents (ex.: Valkyria Chronicles tanks);
- Switch between regions without creating multiple accounts;
- Available on Steam (because they want to make it more popular);
- Cross-platform (playing on PC against casual Android/iOS players).


For better gaming experience, I prefer WoT. Blitz is a poor mobile platform port."
15160,pay 2 win ammo BS
15161,Very nice game
15162,nice gameplay and graphic!!
15163,"recomentet for tablet vs tablet usage, for pc the RNGeejus is pretty devastating, generally high score, likable, light software, good graphics :-)"
15164,;)
15165,...... meh....
15166,"the game is of fair quality but severly over pricedon buying stuff in the game one tank can cost as much as awhole other game it is ridiculousif you wish to encourge more player make the levels easier to rise throughinstead of trying to gouge obsene amouts of of peopleit is definatly not a free game you have the m3 lee with the big gun and not the small but then the b1 small and not the big
"
15167,I love this game SOOOO much I Recomend this game to everyone!!!!
15168,"Banned  wtf, do not coin, played and got a message I was banned,, wow great game, do not waste your time, AB"
15169,"It was fun while it lasted, but I've burned myself out at 100+ hours of this in just couple of weeks.  This game was surprisingly fun in the beginning phase despite being super simple compared to other tank MMO's.  I may return to spend hundreds of hours again on next vacation, but I'll not be playing daily from now on.

-There are issues with retards with disabilities, who have difficulty controlling tanks, constantly send post-game messages that all look identical; ""Moron...!"", because moron seems to be the only word not censored by the system.  Having hundreds of hate messeges inbox makes one feel like the unbreakable hero, but there's option to block/blacklist such.
-There is a platoon system where you can queue in game with a friend (or a normal person without disabilities), but the number is limited to just 1...  Only two players can be teamed up to join a 7vs7 match.
-Limited number of maps make the later matches rather dull, but this is the same case with other tank MMO's.
-Limited configuration of tank parts; no upgrade in hull armor/integrity at all.
-Despite having been updated long time ago to disable dead players typing in chat, some are ""blessed"" to continue to speak after death.

Thanks for entertaining me during my vacation!  I may come back yet."
15170,THE BEST WAR GAME YET ;)
15171,i really dont like it
15172,"Amazing game, almost endless hours of time being spent on this game. Can run on any device and linked my ipad to my laptop so i could play on either. The fat that it is free makes it even better. Some may say it is pay to win. However that is only if you don't like the grind.

Pros:
Easy to play
Fun 
long hours spent on it
choice

Cons:
Graphics are low
Takes too long to get to tier X"
15173,"To be concise, I love this game. 
Does it have all of the features of the base PC game? No, but that isn't what it's meant to be. World of Tanks Blitz was designed for mobile gamers, the people who want fast-paced gameplay and that ability to pick the game up for just a few minutes to play a game. The full PC version has games that consistently take around ten minutes, while games in Blitz take closer to three or four minutes. The best part? Even with fewer tanks on each team, there is no penalty to the progression you make each game. The fact that Wargaming was able to balance this so well is rather impressive to me."
15174,good game !!!!!!
15175,cool
15176,Cool game but after a while it's getting boring. Leveling is pretty slow without premium stuff.
15177,good
15178,"Прикольная игра. Только баланс страдает.
Говорят  скоро исправят."
15179,WHEN IM DOWNLOAD THIS GAME IT ALWAYS AUTOMATICALY PAUSE MAYBE AFTER ONE MINUTE IT GONNA PAUSE AUTOMATICALY
15180,"the game isn't bad but wargaming is making it worse and worse... for example the fake tanks like helsing or dracula, matchmaking etc.  thus to play the game you need more and more patience and very strong nerves.... but overall it's a fun game so you will keep playing it especially If you have couple good friends to play with"
15181,Just don't play it.
15182,"I played this game some time ago when it wasn't on steam , it's still a nice game"
15183,it's fine
15184,there's just no way of explaining why some tanks hit the shit out of you from the front and you do no gamage to them from the same angle
15185,nice game
15186,"you can play it if your feeling interested in handling a full PC game at the time, it offers the same gameplay yet in a smaller and less time consuming manor. The main reason i play it, i can have a good few games before school or work and feel like i was productive with the game time, compared to maybe PC or console where one game might be all the time you have, and it goes badly. THis little game offers a trimed down, but still fun version of tanks, to sum up its purpose on PC is; its for those who don't have the time or don't want to feel the pressure of a normal world of tanks game at the given situation."
15187,hay vcl
15188,i would rather go outside than play this game
15189,"Its fun because it doesnt have arty.
would kill for large sized matches without arty in the main game tho."
15190,"The KV-2 is not biased at all I promise all these one shots I get is all luck, Wargaming pls buff KV-2 ☭"
15191,"do not bother with this one. not because u cant have fun all the naysayers aside...it's because nnnnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooo is plating it. not since early Feb have i been able to find more than 8-22 players in the queue.

that doesnt cut it. u have to have 14 players with the same tier level to even get a match. AINT happening lately.

waits averaging 2-10 minutes and still nothing. STEAM can drop this and ill suc up the loss. why players have left STEAM on this one is unknown....but i can guess.

pass it byand dont spend money on it.

amen."
15192,good game
15193,"Got it to stomp mobile players but it turns out you play on different servers

No reason to play this version just play the real World Of Tanks

0/10"
15194,"pls give 500 golds pls i like you game
"
15195,"If you are the type who prefers pure action in fast-paced combat then this is for you. The Game physics are almost realistic like what part of the tank you should hit to deal critical damage or what position/angle to fire at the armor so the ammo would penetrate the armor, this game needs skills and tactics, sometimes you'll be on a fight where your enemies are overpowering but believe me, with proper team work and tactics your team could annihilate them, kinda funny but yeah it happens, it still depends on the player not the tank. With considerable playtime i had with this game both on android and here on pc, this game is NOT PAY-TO-WIN, all tanks from all tech trees are unlockable (except for premium tanks which i think were not worth spending money) you just have to grind for exp and unlock better equipments and higher tier tanks."
15196,"graphics are terrible
"
15197,"This is a pretty good copy, but it does not compare to the original!"
15198,Great game
15199,Imaginary tanks like dracula and hellsing just broke this game. No fun :(
15200,War thunder is a much better game this game is so pay2win that clash of clans would think its unbalanced!
15201,"Pay to win, bought the Type-62 and won everygame with it, rather you get the PC one"
15202,"its a really good game ,but should have a linux port XD"
15203,"This is possibly the worst tank game i have ever played. It feels like an unfair fuck fest of luck that makes you want to barf every second you look at it. it needs to do something stupid and shoot its self in the foot so it loses all of its members and i dont have to see its fucking ugly ass face ever again.

15204,This game was so good to play but need more update from real WOT this game make a easy acces for everyone and most importand is i love this game
15205,"I find this game commonly frustrating yet, a game I continue to run back too. Something about the challenge of improving, outplaying enemy players, and moving onward to new tanks, keeps bringing me back in, and although the developers make some questionable desicions from time to time, they typically aren't as bad as the community makes them out to be. All and all this game dosen't deserve bad reviews simply for being ported, as not everybody has $600+ computers to run the actual PC version. A game should be rated on it's gameplay and preformance, not it's origin. Either way, this game is a double edged sword, that both frustrates and exilrates, and can be both tense, yet slow at the same time. Overall this game is one I'd reccomend for the casual budgetted gamer, who wants a fun, competitive envrioment, without the need of some exuberant machine."
15206,this games graphics so bad. I think War Thunder is the best game in this category
15207,"this game is  awesomeeee ,i already play this game  about 69 hours"
15208,this is basically world of tanks for disabled people
15209,"This is a good game if your PC can't handle the PC version of world of tanks.
It is pretty much the same game.

And there isn't any artillery! :)

One thing to keep in mind, this game started out on mobile devices and is cross-platform. That means you can and will meet people playing on for example their phones. So by having a mouse and keyboard you have a huge advantage over some players, unless they are extremely skilled."
15210,"This is my favorite game for many reasons, mostly that it's so fun to play in any tier or tank you choose there are also many playstyles that can fit your liking with exceptionally well balanced gameplay mechanics.

People say that this game is ""Pay to Win"" when it really isn't, sure you have to grind alot above a certain tier but that's what makes the game what it is there are microtransactions such as premium time that can help you earn more Exp per battle but hey WG is a business they need to make money somehow.

At the end of the day this game is free you lose nothing by downloading and giving it a shot
It also gots very often updates and events almost every month!"
15211,Excelent
15212,Very good game
15213,It's light and multiplatform.It is actually a mobile game but I truly recommended it because you can play it with your friends with their budget PC and it has the same experience between paying player and free playing player so this is not a pay to win game.
15214,"If you're looking for a new game to explore and free. YOU MUST DOWNLOAD & TRY THIS GAME!!! 

I think props to developers for putting this game on mobile. WHY (mobile experience on this game would be FUGLY because crappy controls etc.???! Because it drive new players to try this game. At least thats how i got hooked into this game.

I have steam for quite some time, but i NEVER had the will to try this game, because i thought it would be typical crappy cheap F2P games. I never knew this game existed before if this game didn't go mobile. 

I was annoyed because of the crappy controls and many more issues on mobile. Until i discover how other players played so well, there's no way you could be a pro in this game playing on mobile. 

Now, i always play this game daily. Can't wait to explore new EXCITING tanks, strategy, players, maps, modules, etc.!!!

Summary: THIS GAME IS EXCITING & FUN!!! Definitely ""Ä MUST-TRY"" Good job!!!

Suggestion: they should upgrade this game like in the wargaming.net website. But with the Steam Version gameplay. The Wargaming.net version is too Sniping & Camping oriented, and so quick to die. But the graphic, customization and details in the wargaming.net are much better.

Note: Playing in mobile: Impossible, Steam: Varies Gameplay, Wargaming.net: Too easy to die, Hide, Camp, Damage intake quite high & Snipe oriented."
15215,great game
15216,"Excellent game that is really easy to play. People say its harder for phone people against PC players, its not. I play on both. Its completely fine :) 

This game is excellent is without a doubt the next best armoured warfare game on Steam after War Thunder, the games are quick and easy to get the hang of, the playerbase is really good as compared to other games and after the first few 'what the heck?' games you might have its a really good game,."
15217,"War gaming is persistantly nerfing tanks and ""balancing"".  They did this to the pc version.
Simply not as fun as it was.  Blitz or the PC Version.  Tanks are slower and/or waeker with every update.
War gaming has lost sight of what it created.   GL 007."
15218,nice
15219,Намальна
15220,Nice game
15221,"I really enjoyed this game.
some of the pros of it are the available tanks and upgrades you can get for them, the detail of it and the customization is perfect! the maps are pretty good too. (though i wish there were more) You can play as all the factions involved in WW2: U.S., Britain, Germany, U.S.S.R, Japan, and France. I am still hoping for Italy to come in even though there are already chinese tanks you can play as.
Some of the cons that i have found:

-Your gun can go through buildings like they are invisible. I think it would be more immersive if your gun got caught on things like rocks and buildings.

-I think there should be an option in the matchmaker to only play on teams that are only 1 faction instead of the usual mix, i like the other way but i think it would be more fun to see how factions do against eachother.

-the whole spotting system, i think it should all be ""line of sight"". the spotting system destroys my experience during gameplay and gives hugely unfair advantages in tricky situations that require you to be able to see an enemy. for example: instead of you noticing an enemy as it is moving from around a corner to shoot you, with the spotting system you have to wait a few seconds before the game ALLOWS you to see them, and by then he has gotten of his shot and has retreated back. this is extremely frustrating and im surprised everybody who plays the game is okay with it.

-the XP system is broken. the game has an XP multiplier for when you win your first battle of the day, and it has never worked for me. also the amount of XP you earn per battle never goes above around 1000 for a victory even as you advance into the higher tiers, which makes grinding out for tanks an extreme bore, and i love grinding for stuff its just it takes forever to advance through the factions in this game.

All in all i love this game and recommend it to most anybody."
15222,"Its ok but the normal WoT is far better. And the download time is far longer too. BUT normal WoT is unbalanced as heck and is no fun. There isnt any AI mode to grind on or anything so the game isnt all that good. Its somewhat like robocraft.

Play warthunder. Better graphics. Balanced. Pretty speedy matchmaking."
15223,"OK, so you are probably reading the reviews for this game, wondering if you should download it or not. Well, I'm here to tell you that you should.

Now some people think that if they want to play Blitz, they'll play it on their mobile devices and if they want to play it on their PC... well they won't, they'll just go get the regular PC version, right? I agree, that's even what I would do. But what if you have a laptop, or a PC not powerful enough to run the desktop version of World of Tanks, and you find that the mobile version is hard to play due to the controls? Well, that was my situation. I tried playing the PC version of WoT but my laptop would not run it very well, and I knew the hours of grinding would be painful if they would be spent running the game at 15 fps constantly. So I downloaded this, and I kid you not when I say it fixed all my problems. It's World of Tanks Blitz (which I didn't mention I LOVED) with PC controls (I hated the mobile controls!). But enough with that; let's get to the contents!

WoT Blitz is easier. No doubt about it, and I know some people don't like it easy. But it's easy compared to the desktop World of Tanks. It still requires skill and strategy (somewhat) if you want to be successful. Just not as much as it's popular big brother. What mainly makes it easier is the grind. You don't need silver to buy the modules, and the experience is gained easier (I believe). The 7v7 matches go by quick and the small maps make sure there is action throughout the entire battle. There are also many events that take place that allow you to score some goodies, like boosters, credits, gold and premium tanks! Like the Lost Division event going on right now. These events always keep me playing because I'm working for something, I have the chance to win tanks and other valuable prizes (although the chances in this current Lost Division event are very small!). They also like to get creative with their tanks, for example; the Helsing HO or the Tankenstein. The tournaments are also exciting as they can reward you and your team.

So, the conclusion. With all the content in this game and the keyboard/mouse controls (if you don't like mobile controls), there's nothing else I can say but get it and enjoy it! As long as you don't depend on insanely great graphics to have fun with a game, you'll love this version of World of Tanks as you would any other."
15224,ITS GOOD BUT I WOULD JUST GET THE NORMAL WORLD OF TANKS!!
15225,NICE QUALITY GAME I RECOMEND FOR ALL OFU GUYS WHO LIKES SEC WORLD WAR LIFEEXPERIENCE! :D
15226,bad
15227,"This Is Fun Beacuase it can be better then the other world of tanks and also please fix the pysics XD :P i rlly Recommend this GaMe!

15228,.
15229,A very good game to relax when u are already tired with your noob teamates on PC
15230,"I love this game. But the French update made my game unable to work. When I load up, it will try to find region and then proceed to say network not connected. I know the network works because I can play other online games. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!"
15231,Wonderfully short. Easy and very involved. Great for when you get home! awesome with teams or without!
15232,"Having well over 10K battles and accounts on .eu, .ru and even asian (300ms pings - hehe) servers in ""normal"" WoT - I like Blitz more.
Why?
- It's faster and more fun. Having 6 dumbasses in a team is less disappointing than having 14 of them - things get resolved much faster and you waste less time. matchmaking is fast as well.
- It's only 3Gigs and it is unified for all regions - compare that to having 3 copies of a game for each region, each 15+GB. Sure, there's no ""HD models"" but who needs them in a shooter, anyway?
- maps are much smaller and not that flat as we're used to: you can outmaneur your opponents and hide behind hills; situations ""someone is shooting at me but I don't see them"" are less common as well.
- no arty :)


Anything I don't like? Sure:
- Uncompletable tasks - like ""do something in supremacy mode"" - but it's just a fraction of battles and you can't explicitly choose that mode, so it's ""something random must happen during yet another random activity"", the probability of that is pretty low.
-""vegetable players"" - as I understand, people with mobile devices play along with us, PC guys. They are clearly in disadvantage.
- gold from WoT can't be used here
- your progress in WoT doesn't matter either (it does frustrate when you have a garage with uncountable number of vehicles in WoT yet you have nothing here)
- stupid, annoying purchase offers ""19 minutes remaining!""
"
15233,"Pro:
Doesn't require expensive GPU to play
Fast game queue, almost instant
Really able to play for free just longer grinds, unlike other microtransaction games.
Monthly updates

Con:
Playerbase a little low
MatchMaking sometimes being unfair."
15234,"Delete this game and you will just realize that life is so amazing without this trash. No chat after you die and just watch some noobs playing.The recent update ruins everything. I used to spent bunch of money and time but now I feel happy just after I delete this game. guys, trust me,Do NOT waste your time on this."
15235,"I like the fast paced gameplay compared to the PC. Diverse tanks to play and requires skill.
For Future players, try to dedicate effort in this or people won't appreciate it."
15236,Literally a PoS.  Got up to level 7 but now they match level 7 against level 9s.  Absolutely no chance in the game.  Lose so many credits each game that no more credits to play another game without spending actual money.  Bye bye World of tanks.
15237,Nice feeling with engine and power with shooting taget! great =)
15238,The most addicting game I've ever played. I would rate this 11/10 if I could. I have invested about 1000 hours and over $300 and counting. I absolutely love how this is a multi-platform game that I can play on PC or my cell phone.
15239,"Perfect wot game for low end laptop. BTW, there is no arti in this game!"

Когда только появилась World of Tanks Blitz я был одним из первых,кому удалось установить эту игру на Ipad.
Я очень сильно кайфовал,когда играл в эту игру.Я даже школу прогуливал ради этой игры.
Вообщем после релиза на ПК я помню когда были негативные отзывы от этой игры.
Теперь подведём итоги этой игры.
Геймплей 4/5
Графика 2/5
Коммюнити 4/5
Донат 1/5
Главным плюсом этой игры является отсутствие артелерии.
Бои очень динамичные и быстрые.
Игра очень интересная для FREE TO PLAY.
Эта игра достойна,чтобы в нее поиграть.
Донат-это главный минус этой игры.Без доната развиваться очень сложно,но можно.Но на каждый праздник или вроде такого разработчики дарят игрокам много разных плюшек.

15260,Stop porting mobile games to Steam.
15261,The game was good when I first got it. Now the lobbies are COMPLETELY full of OP French tanks.

15263,Cool game with great physics and tanks and very hard game to memorise the attacks
15264,pure love <3
15265,"World of Tanks Blitz was originally a simplified version of the PC game World of Tanks, for the mobile market. As such, it had simplified controls, simplified models, simplified textures, simplified UI and simplified everything else. This was fine, and in time the game has gotten a small community of it's own. But porting the mobile, severely dumbed down version back to PC, has not made it a true alternative to the original.

I'll make it simple for you.
If you play Blitz on mobile devices a lot, and only occasionally want to play a game on the PC, do go ahead and try this. It will let you play the same game, so you keep your progression and everything else between your mobile devices and the PC.
If on the other hand you don't play mobile games much if at all, and just want a game to play exclusively on the PC, please forget about this. Then you should go download the full, original World of Tanks for PC from their webpage. It's just as free, much better, more content, bigger community and more fun.

Oh, and if anyone thinks they can use this game to sit on a PC with keyboard and mouse, and stomp on players running it from mobile devices. Sorry, but there are separate matchmaking queues. Even Wargaming was not going to allow that kind of rampant sealclubbing."
15266,its very nice to play
15267,i like this game :D
15268,"It's a great game with a unbelievable  variety of tanks and other attachments. though sometimes online matchmaking is unfair, but is still one of the best games I have played."
15269,"You are too autistic to play WoT? This is a real game for you! Play against mobile ''GAMERS""

15270,World of Tanks = WoT = Waste of Time
15271,"Here are things I like about this game.

- Complex strategy
- Tons of unique tanks
- Not a pay to win game
- Occasionally gives free premium accounts
- Can ram tanks to their death
- Gets suprisingly intense in sometimes
- Can snipe tanks from afar
- Takes lots of time to go up to the final rank (Im still tier IV)
- Great graphics
- Feels very satisfying to destroy tanks

10/10 would ram tanks again."
15272,"Good game, it's the mobile version of WoT. just thumb it up so it will become more awesome (maybe)"
15273,"Reinstalled since I saw a bunch of people were on for some reason. Nope, it's still fckng terrible. The folks at WG are worse con artist than gaijin and that's saying something."
15274,A very interesting game with smooth gameplay and somewhat balanced tanks. Recommend the PC version.
15275,its ok if you have a potato pc. dont bother with it if you can run the full game and dont support wargaming's sheit ports so they can rake in extra money.
15276,nice
15277,what an insult. I hope i didn't get any malware from this
15278,"fytr kaanbcvd
"
15279,"World of Tanks has one-shot artillery, giant maps that lock your tank for an hour, even more upgrades to pick up (suspension and radio are important), even more credit loss because visibility and ambushes are everything, more chances to get outnumbered, crew that have to be retrained for every tank they switch to, it's just overall a bigger hassle for a GAME.

World of Tanks is more like an MMO and you're going to have to be heavily addicted to get anywhere. Blitz is fast, fun, and simple for people who just want casual play.

Play Blitz."
15280,"Very nice game.
I like the artwork."
15281,"Have played this game for about 3 months and have a level 7 tank.  Unless you are a Premium Player and pay money you are just canon fodder to the world.   

There seems to be a bias towards putting non premium players in lesser tanks during battles so that you pay to buy better tanks.  Also there are some mythical tanks which move very fast and can shoot very large shells.

Please only play it for a laugh , do not pay any money to buy anything unless you want to and most of all avoid the chat room where more experienced player love to bully new comers.

There are better games out there."
15282,This game is so cool! Way better than normal version of World of Tanks. Every battle is about 7-10 minutes. I recommend it :D
15283,Ya'll don't need me to tell you this is the best Free to Play game there is.  This 100% deserves a download.
15284,No Arty? 10/10 Better than original
15285,"Is a port of a touchscreen game -> Lacks touchscreen controls.





????"
15286,"The reward system is entirely flawed. You get penalized just for playing, and even winning. Sadly, with a broken reward system, it's really difficult to continue playing, let alone spend money. Matchmaking is a complete wreck, as you are are pitted against tanks 2 levels higher than you that you can barely even scratch.

This game has potential to be very fun and rewarding, but for most people that I've played with, most have nothing but negative things to say about this game. It's okay, but makes absolutely no sense to punish people for succeeding at the game.

If you plan on spending money on this game, you must be aware that it is a real money pit, and not worth your frustration. Spend your money elsewhere."
15287,nice game good graphics

its one of those skill required games. these are always not so good for new players but you will learn over time. 

if you ever wanted to drive an old tank from the yee old times you can vurtually do it. 

super easy to run compared to actual world of tanks, also no artillery!

events for basically free tanks.

its free.... why would you not want a free game?

very fun when you get into it.
[h1]cons:[/h1]
mobile optimised but who really cares about that?

P2W basically but i do not suggest getting any premium tanks. just rush the tank you use the most to a higher tier and you will be more happy than a premium tank that is stuck at a certian tier.

lots of toxic use of the voice chat. mainly used for throwing shit at other people doing stupid things and camping tank destroyers when they should be used as campers.

no autolock (unless you right click) but hey, your not a console player... your a pc gamer.... you dont need it.

graphics are kinda meh, but dont let the graphics stop you from playing

[h1]conclusion:[/h1] 
if you like world of tanks but you have a potato for a pc and you cant run the other version of world of tanks, this is your game. its free. its fun. i cant recommend it enough


notes: this opinion is not bias."
15291,"crash after 5 min gameplay, again and again"
15292,This game is loads of fun but some times its very hard
15293,"Lol litreally a port from mobile. Absolutely unbalanced gameplay and TONS of grinding, If you want decent gameplay go play the actual world of tanks the non steam one."
15294,"Play the launcher version, trust me, it's better"
15295,"Please just play the fullsize, regular version.

15299,awesome game
15300,"best game 2017
"
15301,This is a fun little tank game to pick up and have a match. This is the first free game i've played in a LONG time that isn't quite pay to win. You actually have a decent chance not spending a cent. I haven't spent anything and am pretty decent.
15302,I 100% Recommend this game for anyone who loves tanks and has really crappy Hardware Or a patato for a Graphics card i played the crap out of this game on my iPhone 6 and playing it on PC gives you a really good advantage over other players as this game is cross-platform
15303,Wow Even better on my Laptop Ive had it sence the day it came out on IOS and it was a MILLION times better on PC LOVE THIS GAME 2 DEATH!!!!!
15304,"If you like the origional PC WoT but don't like arty and want smaller maps with less players and a somewhat more fair matchmaking experience along with servers called training rooms (kinda like server browsing), this is the game for you. 

10/10
Would chill in chill room again."
15305,"No Friendly Fire, No Arty and GuP Tanks. Perfect"
15306,"Addicting Steam alternative to World of Tanks standalone client. I would play it more often, but it takes too long to rank up tanks, such a problem with Wargaming's other games."
15307,Not as bad as I expected

15310,"it is an excellent game, though like every game it has it's downfalls aswell.
the events are barely completable and there are a lot of unchecked players.

overall, good game, used to have excellent customer support, very bad community, ok events.

warning the game makers prefer mobile over pc, all major tournaments are mobile only and their only suggestion is to buy a mobile phone to play the game.
litterally every time you encounter a problem on pc they refer you to buying a phone."
15311,"Steam asked me if I want to change my review. Nope, game is still terrible and it's actually getting worse with almost every update. Used to be fun, but it isn't anymore."

15318,"Question:  Can you throw a few hundred tonnes of metal, an unending amount of mix-it-up strategy and a tps/fps vibe into a game?

Answer: World of Tanks Blitz

I'm put well over 600 hours into this game and there are still over one hundred new tanks I can play.  Basically, it's long lasting fun.

Come check it out on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/thatguyujustmet"
15319,I like War Thunder better... sorry WOT lol
15320,Werry good game and 100% thenks
15321,good
15322,ujde to
15323,Hey thats pretty good
15324,"I have very mixed feelings about this game. Sure, it's a good time killer if you don't have anything to do. But I find this game does have problems with it. First of all, this game is a noob-zoo, roughly 60% of the players are noobs. It really sucks when you're the only one on your team actually doing sh*t. Most of the time my teammate won't do anything the entire round or will get their tanks blown up by enemies within the first few minutes of the round. It can get really frustrating. Also the controls of this game can get all glitchy at certain times during gameplay. I'll give this game a 4.5/10"
15325,"""Premium""
""Bonus XP""
""Gold""
""$74.99""
Freemium game
Will become a grind after all your starting premium BS runs out.
Classic free to play game.

Edit: And on only my second day of playing, it has the same problem with Heroes and Generals (And I still have 24 hours of PREMIUM) to where you will barely make enough regular in-game money (Not premium access, give us 75$ to buy 1 late game tank money) to pay off the resupplies... and the camoflage resupplies... and provisions resupplies... and equipment resupplies... and tank repairs. Fuck this game."
15326,Россия впред!!!
15327,"Seriously is boring, the goal of this game it's only to unlock different tanks, in the manner of every free-to-play game so you can just buy what you want, by playing over and over the same game mode, ONLY ONE GAME MODE, in the same four, maybe five maps. That's it! What a delusion."
15328,"fast match making
fast games
fast grind
fast fun
"
15329,good
15330,Very good dispite mild violence
15331,"Pretty Fun, Ive spent a few days playing this game and i approve of it and what it is."
15332,"I like the concept and its fun but I can't record with Bandicam. So, I am trying out other tank pvp games. maybe, I have better luck with other games."
15333,Good game. Apart from the normal B.S that comes with these types of games the only thing I can gripe about is that it is very costly to pimp out your tank at the higher levels so you need to grind a ton to get it to your exact specifications. Can see myself sinking many hours into this game.
15334,hello guys my problem is launch this game and Rendering error 0x00000000 whats a problem?
15335,Great game
15336,"very reccommended game, has many tanks, many players, and great gameplay also its free!"
15337,"playing this game for years now and its actually starting to get annoying.. wargamming has made it where new players can get into high tier with money, it wouldnt be so bad but the events they do also require money to get the gold tanks even though you're supposed to get them ""for free""... in this recent event for the type 59 med. i found they last second changed your experience rate right after they started the event.. now instead of only needing 2k dmg. in tier 10, you need 4/5k dmg in tier 10 to get the minimal required exp just for the tank let alone the skin. all wargamming is doing is milking money at this point, and they ""used"" to be a decent game company.... need i mention the 1/3% tank chance in the crates now?"
15338,Its ok
15339,"Very good game!

Nice graphics and phisics.
The experience is awesome but some Europe server is not so good.

I recomand to try this game because is awesome,i have already 3 accounts :)

Try it because deserve all the work for this game in plus is FREE

See you there! :D"
15340,"- Terrible playerbase
- Pay to win
- Broken system

Do yourself a favor and just don't"
15341,"Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone. You progress quite quickly through the game so money doesn't have to be spent unless you're really desperate. However, the biggest problem is the match making. You either smash their team or get smashed. You can be afk on your team and win with maybe one casualty or work your ass off and lose awfully. This can be fixed on future updates but apart from that, it's a solid game. Also, you can run it on a potato so that's always good."
15342,"If you like this game you probably should play ""the real deal"" that is thge World of Taks. The only nice thing going for this is that you can play this same version on PC, tablet and mobile. So you will have the same progression regardless of witch platform you use.
But heres the kicker. People are playing on shared the sarvers with everyone. So what that means is that PC users have major advantage ower mobile and tablet users simply because of the controls. 
But if you are a PC user get ready for numerous crashes and total freezes. At the moment the game has srecwed it self so badly that I can not even get it to start. Did a full reistall and it did to good at all. Has it something to do with the account? Who knows, because you cant chance the account anyways on the PC.

Its an ok time killer if you get it to work. Would recommend playing WOT instead if you are sitting on a computer."
15343,It's definitely a decently addictive game. But meh.
15344,"This is a decent arcade tank battle game. My greatest gripe with it is when enemies are unrendered when they should be. For example, you are tracking a tank and lining up a shot, then suddenly it dissapears and kills you 10s later. It's damn annoying."
15345,"Finally found a game where I can interchangeably play from the PC and then swap to the tablet when it's time to do business elsewhere, involving porcelain.

On a serious note, I actually enjoy playing this much more over the original World of Tanks mostly because of the smaller size teams, maps, and no Artillery. Matches are very short, anywhere from 5-10minutes at most usually and the grind isn't too terribly bad. The balance is something that still seems to favor russian tanks and their crazy DPS to Armor ratio. 

The real beauty is that all my progression between when I play on the PC or when I play on my tablet from the app is tracked as one. If you're a fan of these types of Arena style games you will likely enjoy this more casual version of WoT.

Pro's:
[list]
[*]Fast Matches
[*]No Artillery
[*]Progression shared between Mobile App and PC
[*]Easy to jump in and play
[*]Great time killer
[/list]
Con's:
[list]
[*]Game balance favors russians with massive DPS.
[*]Lower level graphics than the original (Likely due to being App friendly)
[*]Seems to be a lot of AFK people (Or maybe people with connection issues)
[/list]"
15346,super addicting
15347,"Update 3.8 breaks the game with stupid changes, takes away things people grinded for for hours or paid for with real money, while making it so that you have to pay AGAIN to get at least some stuff back or grind for for years - literally. You got a couple tier 10 tanks, some premiums, a bunch of keepers from every tier? Good luck reequipping them - it will only take you TEN TO FIFTY YEARS if you dont play the f**king r***rded missions. If you do play the missions, it will take you 1 to 5 years. Great change. Simply wonderful.

And yeah, as said, even things you paid for get f**ked, so if you have 30-40 ish premium tanks like I do, you just got f**ked har, no lube, no nothing, not even a warning and a suggestion to bite the pillow. All you are left with is bleeding a**, rage, humiliation and hundreds of € worth of premium content that just got shredded appart and you have to GRIND and/or PAY AGAIN to get the tanks you ALREADY PAID FOR into the state they were in when you bought them.

F**K YOU WG, I HOPE YOU ALL CHOKE TO DEATH ON MY MONEY"
15348,"Editing my review of world of tanks blitz, I previously stated that the game was worse than a pile of garbage. Im not changing that opinion but now I want to say I understand that the pc version is now as garbage as this version as well"
15349,"The game it's good and devs too! And here is why:
[list]
[*] Very fun to play at start ( so satisfying when you get kills )
[*] If you finish like first five missions u got 1000+ gold ( that's pretty decent )
[*] Variety of tanks
[/list]
[b] THE ONLY CON FOR ME !!! [/b]
The game gets a little bit bored after you got a few of good tanks
"
15350,dobra igra
15351,this is a funky version of WOT.
15352,"For Linux, please."
15353,nice game fags
15354,didziausias sudas koki zaidziau huinia visiska pzda bentjau butu pasistenge normaly game padaryt bet ble toks sudas gavos ka zinau :)
15355,Nice one TEEN!
15356,"Pretty good game, except when you get into higher tiers because its just russian tanks running around with 400+ damage every 10 seconds"
15357,The games handles like a potato and its fugly
15358,"WOT - Simple but intreging.  Tank levels are in Tiers and beginners don't have to worry about going up against very senior players in much bigger tanks.  The concepts are simple - teamwork wins. You are thrown into a random match of 7 vs 7 everyone will be at your level or within 1 tier of you.  Each map has its pro's and con's. Each type tank has it's Pro's and Con's. Learn them and rule the battlefield.  You can level up tanks, or earn specials of various Tiers so that you can play varied Tier matches early.  A Very Fun and Very Absorbing game.  While in game purchases exists, they don't seriously advantage one player over another in the matches, and they are not required to progress or be strong in matches. 
Very well formed game compared to so many Free To Play games.  Most Highly recommended."
15359,cool
15360,Hell Yeah..!!
15361,"If you like world of tanks but don't want to waste a bunch of time progressing or don't have the performance to play WOT, this is for you."
15362,If you can't get enough WoT you can play this on your tablet or phone.
15363,I can't run. It used to. Now it doesn't even open when i click play.
15364,"Meh.. it's a nice game but I think that having the World of Tanks that is the real PC version would be better. However since we have no choice what to do, I think putting Blitz on steam is a great start for wargaming. Not only more people will know about the game but you'll get horrifying fps that you'll never ever get on your devices. Over 40fps. :)"
15365,"Its a fun game if you understand the mechanics and know the characteristics of each tank and how to maneuver with them.
The game becomes more rewarding the more experience you gain (not the in-game experience but actual gaming experience), being able to turn around battles the otherwise seem impossible to win, although there are still many instances where that is not the case. I personally don't think this is as casual of a game as it seems to be considering that if you don't really have a plan or be versatile with the situation, you can die very quickly missing put on a lot of the action. I must include that it does not mean that you're supposed run away from everything just to survive until the end but to understand your role in the battle and act accordingly. Acting accordingly can mean many things differing with which tank you're driving hence gaining experience the hard way so you know what to do in certain situations.
One thing to mention is that this game is not a pay-to-win game and is more skill based, although I think that WarGaming is heading towards a grey area with recent updates but ultimately, those functions are boosters and there is still skill required to be able to effectively draw the full potential of each tank.

I ranted on too much and for those who felt that it seems too complicated I'll just say that its not that hard of a game if you learn and think, everything else should naturally follow with it.
"
15366,"I've played the original World of Tanks and World of Tanks Blitz and I would have to say I've enjoyed WOT Blitz more than the original. The original has better graphics, bigger maps, and more in-depth gameplay but for overall enjoyment this one is it. I don't have it on mobile yet but that's something I'd like to get in the future."
15367,"i love this game,its awesome"
15368,"Frame Rate Can be average, no real lobby system fix that and should be sweet"
15369,"It's Not Bad.

15370,"Upadate: 3.8 is a farce and money grab. I had 70 fully equipped tanks before the patch. Now I have 4 tanks. How is this fair. WG expect me to grind for years and wait for timers to get the tanks back to how they were. Sorry WG you just lost a paying customer. 

I have played this game since beta on IOS. I have hundreds of hours logged. 

Pros
- 7v7 means fast frantic combat very quickly - there is little camping or waiting for action as it will quickly come to you.
- Mechanics of cover, sidescraping, penetration, camo, spotting etc work the same as Wot PC
- There are plenty of maps.
- The MM is +1/-1 meaning you are top tier 50% of the time, unlike PC 
- Way easier for a good player to carry and win, I have a 70% WR mostly solo. 
- Game still looks fine with graphics on Max, its not WOT PC but will run on older computers.
- Lots of tanks to grind and loads of premium tanks should you have some cash to burn.
- Active developers update every month, lots of competitions.
- your account will work on mobile so your Ipad/Phone will have the same tanks etc

Neg
- There is no balance in the MM so the teams are random. You will get lots of blow outs if one team gets the good players.
- Bad players, as in lack of skills, there is a limited tutorial and the game is a mobile game meaning many people don't know what they are doing.
- It is very hard to gain credits without a premium account (costs gold/money), especially at the higher tiers.
- Stock tanks and crew are painful, you can skip this pain using gold to get 100% crew and free XP. So its not pay to win but more pay to advance.
- Some players will rage at you in chat
- There are still problems with AFK players which really hurt your chances of winning as 6v7 is harder than 7v7

Overall a very enjoyable version of WOT which is quick, fun and addictive."
15371,I played this game a lot on my mobile phone and i love it but i stopped because i was busy and the game take a lot of battery and space on my mobile so i stopped playing it. i tried the full game but i did't like it like this one and i made a lot of progress on the mobile version so i glad that i can play it on my PC
15372,"Controls are floaty, graphics are bad, maps are tiny, tank balance is a complete mess. Overall just a worse version of PC wot in every single way except the absence of artillery, which is the only plus."
15373,"Do you hate Arty in World of tanks ? Do you have conspiracy Theories of being bottom tier with a 2 Tier spread every game  ? Is the weight of your Team full of stupid people too heavy for you to carry in World of tanks ? Do you like Raging at your screen all the time ? Does your Shitty Computer can't make world of tanks work ? 

If you said yes to any of your Questions, this is your game !

[spoiler] No Arty, 1 Tier spread mm, your crappy computer can run this game, and yes expect some broken keyboards, mouses, Computer screens, Computers and Laptops [spoiler]"
15374,oof
15375,"Very good game and graphics.Thanks for Wargaming. Also people should play World of Warships, it is pretty epic!"
15376,I have this on PC and XBOX and i reccomend it on both platforms.
15377,"Reasonably fun game. Around mid-game it can become a grind, but played intermittently it is fun. With that said, I've never played the real WOT, and the first place I played WOT:B was on my Android tablet."
15378,borring
15379,Game crashes after 2 or 3 min
15380,"Sweet game it can be downloaded at computer even at telephone

+VERY fast tank action game with alot tanks to research
+Mega fun with derp guns
+It's Free 2 Play!
+Good graphics quality

-Some part of community is soo salty
-So much glitches that must be fixed

in my opinion game is good, but the number of glitches and part of such bad community is completely idk. how to say This game require to download very short amount of time and i recomend this game because you can easily train your WoT skills and quick tank research is good, and tutorial is... Awesome! So much starter gold and The KV-2 is the best but it needs a buff for a HE rounds :)"
15381,"Fun game to play, but be ready for backlash if you lose a battle in the higher tier tanks."
15382,T2 light tank beats T2 tank destroyer in 1v1 matchup. Bad game is bad.
15383,"If you find appeal in this game, just go play the real non-steam PC version."
15384,"its not like most games where you have to pay to play, its actually based on skill and choice making. 8/10 for the occasional unbalanced teams"
15385,it reminds me of Blitzkreig when you move your tank lol
15386,This is a awesome game i recommend it to everyone. But the controls are a bit hard to get use to but other then that its one of the best war games i have played in a long time.
15387,"A Really good game, Addicting and Fun!! Recommend buying :)"
15388,"Despite what some people say, this game is not P2W
Though it is slow to gain higher tier tanks, it is not impossible, and theres a large selection to choose from.

I do reccommend this game, though I wish there were more game modes, along with offline play."
15389,I love this game
15390,This game is like my 3-meo-pcp addiction. It damages my brain yet I keep doing it.
15391,"good game
"
15392,not so funny
15393,yeahh noiseeeeeeeeee gameeee noiseee mate noiseeeeee
15394,Pls play the real WoT for PC not this Version from andriod/IOS !!!!! // Spielt bitte die richtige Version für denn PC!! Die Version vom Handy aufn PC ist Dreck des braucht keiner ! WoT ist aber eins dee besten WW2 spiele!
15395,I like the game and it is a great port from mobile to pc but some things that could be impoved/added are a version for linux and controller support
15396,"Gr8 Game better than original WoT
"
15397,"The progression through the game is incredibly slow. Most will say that they enjoy lower teir tanks anyway, but the truth is that when the game forcibly matches you against better tanks, you can only do so much. Armor is harder to penn, your armor is useless, and the tanks eare faster, bigger, etc. Only download if you plan on sinking thousands of hours into the game. I hav eplayed this on the tablet for years, and now retired it on the PC, and although i have 300= hours on the game, I have only managed two teir 7 tanks, about half of the grind to get to a point where you can't be matched with higher tanks. They also censor too much in chat. Clearly a game made for profits."
15398,"So good. Lots of historical tanks, good gameplay, quick battles. One of the best games in many Years."
15399,Another pay to win game!!!!
15400,Its a fun tank pvp game if you have ever loved fair team pvp i would play this its very similar to World of Tanks.
15401,am i the only one noticed the similarites to war thunder?
15402,PLAY IT
15403,"Fun game until I couldnt move turret/freeview. Postet a ticket about it but only answer I got was to use a program that checked the netework. Since I had no problem loading the game and even start games, it was clearly not the network preventing me from looking around. Pointed that out in the ticket, only to get a reply 15 mins later to use the program and check the network, and then the ticket got closed... Had to delete the game and reinstall it, and on a slow line that takes time :(

Would I recommend it? Sure, it is fast and can be fun, just hope it doesnt bug up on you too."
15404,"LOVE THIS GAME!!!
"
15405,I find this game loads of fun. It is kinda like a rip off of the proper WOT but i find blitz very relaxing compared to WOT and for this reason i enjoy it alot more.
15406,RMD like this
15407,"Matchmaking does not exist. You will lose 7 games in a row with all your team being totally obliterated in seconds just to see 8th game won by single guy with average tank who will shoot all enemies like a flying dragon-ninja with rest of your team trying to take one or two single hits for themselves without any hope of killing something. Second thing are the premium players (also called gold noobs - guess why :) ). When you see T6 Dracula in enemy, you know game is over, but still you can't even quit - only hope he will run for your life first, so then only after you got killed, you can go back to garage to start another battle. If you die first, you at least don't waste much time. If you die last? Well f*** you! That's the spirit of this game. 

Now accaording to mechanics - you have to buy equipement, and for some tanks also premium ammo... thats not bad. Second thing - tank destroyers - playing them would be much fun, despit the fact there is one map where you can go to two locations to camp. If you don't be lucky enough to play on it, well you can just charge, waiting till something fast will flank you and shot from behind when you will be cursing and desperately trying to turn back while waiting for broken track to repair, or use kit and waste money cuz he shoot your track again second after and kills you anyway. 

About players. Team will help you... in your dreams. But in game they will allways left you alone to die fighting vs 5 of enemy when 6 of your team will struggle to kill 2, one of which is afk. If you don't stay back, they will with pleasure push you forward to be their meatshield, just to lose the battle minute after you will got shot from 10 diffrent directions. And if you manage to avoid those two dangers, they will wait like a hungry wolves just to steal all your kills when enemy, who you are dueling will have 5hp left.

And also Leopard with machinegun capable of piercing 10cm of steel is a f****** joke -,-. What is this?! Heavy bolter from W40k?!

But one big advantage of this game - no artillery.

So if you are a masochist who like tanks - go on. If you are not - stay away from it.

P.S.
Also I have 100 hrs on steam writing this but more than 200 hrs on android version which is 100% the same, to the point that players from both platforms can play together (I have checked it) so I think, I have right to post my words here."
15408,"Its a fun game that had me hooked
"
15409,This game is one of the best I have ever played. It is a slow game but in the end it is a very fun and satisfying one. It has battles in which you will have a team of 7 (including you) and you can either capture a base or destroy the entire enemy team. This is a very active and demanding game so I would only recommend this to people who have spare time and can be committed to a something like this.
15410,"If you have played battlefield, this game is just like the tank system put into a single game. Plus all of these god damn tank upgrades and micro transactions. Also I hate getting killed all the time by people who wave the best god damn tanks in the game. If you want this game, Good luck :) :) :)"
15411,"Fist of all, this game is super and great i have fun playing it, but it's full of afks; it's 7vs7, but most of the times you see yourself and the rest of your team going 5vs7 or even alone(sometimes your get lucky and there's no afk), i have a high win rate (55%+), but it started coming down from 60% from losing because of afks, this is a team play game, but it's useless since you don't have a worthy team most of the matches; recommend using this game if you play with friends, if you relay on the matchmaking system you'll just get angry because of afks and trolls (Heavy tanks covering behind lights tanks and waiting for last shoot). And seriously, we need a report system like WOT. I prefer WOTB over WOT, but is coming down for those reasons."
15412,good game but if u remove your earphones or plug in than the sound stops working so thats a bug ...else is fine
15413,"Where should I start? Well if you had played the PC version, there shouldn't be much difference so I'll make it short:

Pros:
-Fast games(lasts 7 mins per match), means fast grinds to higher tier tanks
-7 v 7 battles (I did say very fast games, did I?)
-Very easy to grind compared to PC version, upgrades only require your tank's exp, no credits involved
-No artillery!!! (Rejoice!!!!)
-Good variety of maps
-2 game modes for variety (Standard and domination)
-many stuff are streamlined and cheaper (crew skills, training, modules, consumable, etc)
-very addictive, seriously, its like weed.....only more safer

Cons:
-controls are not the same as PC version
-uses old physics engine compared to PC version (not really a con but just saying it here)
-the 7 v 7 battles may be a little not fun if the enemy team decides to bum rush your team
-2 game modes only and you can't choose which to go in, only rng decides
-rng heavy. no joke.
-very rng heavy!!!
-all tanks in battle will be given a visual guide to tell players where the armour is the thinnest. makes the game less fun though pro players may know a thing or two better than an average player
-very skill based, even with premium stuff, you have to use ur brains

Conclusion:
Its a different beast compared to its PC version big brother with a few changes here and there to suit the mobile market. Now it is a mobile game so don't expect everybody to be communicating like in the PC version, which is kind of a good news bad news situation. Anyways, its still a fine game and you should definitely try it out if you think the PC version is just not working out for you or you are new to the World of Tanks series of games."
15414,For some reason War Gaming thought it was a nice idea to put Blitz on PC & on steam; but I guess it was a good idea since now I can just play it here when my phone battery dies.
15415,"Really a very good multiplyer game, shooting experience with tanks are fine enough and keeps the whole system pretty easy to use that is most important, means even newbies are ready to play by their own, no need of extra support in understanding the game basics, easy, fun and quite beautiful game, and seems nice playing as tank. Later it turned better in visuals to gameplay and events are still gold Rush 😂"
15416,I don't know why but it takes me over  3-4 mins to load a map... at the beginning it works perfect but aftetr 2-3 matches that shit starts over and over again and i always die before i even joined the game! -.-
15417,"no SPG
great game, toxic community"
15418,very nice symplified version on wot. there are no major p2w mechanics..
15419,It's not really fair to be fighting people who are playing with inferior controls on a tablet or smart phone but it's fun to seal club if you're that cynical.
15420,Best game ever!
15421,this game is just regular world of tanks without all of the pointless BS in it
15422,Great play. Good team work. Good shot dynamics. Fun Play.
15423,"i find it odd that on pc we have the phone variant of the pc game but not the pc game itself.
when they gonna give us the good shit?"
15424,id rather have world of tanks you cant change your tank after a battle
15425,P2W Alien Tanks
15426,noice
15427,"Good game, even better than the original. Decent graphics for a pc and one of the best on mobile. They have good events where you can get free premium tanks and some of them are not even impossible :)). Only - is that they didnt add all the tanks from the original game so far."
15428,"Oyun ekonomisi çöp
P2W Premium tankınız yoksa oyun leş"
15429,Best tank game ever under War Thunder.
15430,"Game is absolutely magnificent. Tanks are just perfect. Storyline is supreme. If you like tanks, then you are going too love this game. For free to play, is one of the best."
15431,"Match maker system usually Extremism of unfair.
Please change the name to ""Unbalance Gaming""
a lot bot , people is not playing, just botting at match
world of bot, world of rubbishest"
15432,"This game is pretty damn good if looking for a game similair to wot pc that  can run on your potato low end pc/laptop, I would recomend this pretty highly since the game has a high progress level and you can keep on getting better learning new tricks etc. However this game is getting pretty repetitive so it would be nice if they would add skirmishes (clan wars however you can join all the time any time and if u win u get some ranking and get put on a leaderboard with rewards, similair to pc) Also after I get very good and achieve all my goals the only thing that you can do is grind which is pretty boring so I would like if MOE (Marks Of Excellence) were added so that you could have a goal of being better than so and so players and earning a very nice visual reward. So please try to add more things to the game and I will be even more satisfied :D"
15433,"I've read reviews comparing this to World of Tanks.  Yes, there are fewer players per game and the maps are less detailed in Blitz, but you don't sit in the queue for eternity for a game to start.  That feature alone has caused me to stick to Blitz.  The steam community is also a big part of why I enjoy Blitz."
15434,"It is awful compared to the original WoT. I already hated the mobile Blitz and this sucks equally much. Simply it looks bad, the tanks control really bad, aiming is bad and so on. 

Nothing fun."
15435,nice
15436,"World of Tanks Blitz is a fun free to play game for any person or persons interested in PvP. Particularly when you take the role of a Tank Commander, with your own tank to use in combat. 

The aim of the game is simple: choose the tank you desire from 6 different nations and play against enemy teams of 7 with your own randomized team and win in whatever map you've been put in. You can choose from Britain, France, Russia, The United States, Germany and Japan.

Each tank is unique across each nation's tank 'tree'. Although they are divided into similar branches such as Tank Destroyers, Heavy Tanks, Light Tanks (scouts) and Medium Tanks, you don't have to worry about not getting the tank you want because there are so many across all 6 nations. With various shapes and sizes, you are guaranteed to get the tank you desire.

As you progress through the game, you are awarded credits and experience from each battle which you can use to either customize or upgrade your tank by getting better equipment or armaments. If you get enough experience after fighting enough battles, you can buy the next tank in line which follows. There are 10 Tiers of Tanks: Tier 1-10 and each get tougher and harder to get as you progress in tiers.

If you want to play with a friend you can platoon with one and fight alongside them in matchmaking. You don't have to wait long once you've joined the queque in matchmaking because it usually only takes a few seconds before you're off in a 7v7 match. 

If you feel you're not ready against other players, you can go to the training room and fight bots.

Now, one of the biggest gripes that many people have with this game is the in-game currency system. Some feel that it's a pay-to-win type of game because you can exchange real money to buy 'gold' which allows you purchase (with said gold) Premium accounts which allow you to get 50% more credits and experience from each battle. You can also use gold to speed up the rate at which you buy equipment (there's a certain time delay), buy tanks, improved tank rounds, credits and camos. Rest assured that while gold does play a role in the game, it doesn't hinder it as directly as some might make you feel.

Every day you are given missions which award you credits, experience and award tokens. If you collect 20 award tokens, you can exchange these for premium certificates that can last 24, 9 or 1 hour in game. Missions always give out award tokens in groups of 4 and you can complete up to 3 each day. Recently they've also added 3 of various sizes which refill every few days containers, which give out a variety of items such as credits, combat boosters (which can increase the amount of xp your vehicle attains in battle), gold or a premium tanks (which when used award more credits then those of the same tier: a Farming tank if you will that you may or may not be able to get in the game's store using gold).

To use gold, you need to use your real money to get it (except if you get it from tournaments and event awards). And the use of gold only speeds up the rate of progression that you will attain. If you grind your way through the game using the game's resources that they give you, you'll learn through experience and build up a wealth of knowledge which will allow you to beat other players who haven't learn't the funner and more thrilling way of playing through experience.

Good luck and have fun. Also remember to type in chat, at the end of each game 'gg wp' (Good Game Well Played) as courtesy.

15437,good
15438,No good.
15439,"THIS GAME SUCKS I CANT EVAN GET THROUGH TOURAL FIRST SEP LOOK LEFT CANT LOOK LEFT
"
15440,"Greetings fellow tankers and potential players!

I am a former player of the PC version and I was a part of the invite-only Beta test for Blitz and have been playing for 3 years now.  This version of WoT is different, but the same as the PC or console version.  To enable a consistent experience between devices, it has some limitations.  All in all, it is a very fun, fast-paced gaming experience.

Pros:
7 on 7 gameplay
No Artillery!
Small map sizes to promote fast gameplay
The ability to see if you will penetrate armor while in Sniper mode

Cons:
No Artillery...  (I was a fan of artillery in the PC version)
Limited graphics compared to the PC or console versions
Not all the tank lines are represented

Regardless, this is a very fun and fast-paced game that keeps me riveted.

(I have not paid or approached to make this review.  At of this review, I have over 5000 games played, not all on Steam, though.)"
15441,My Favourite Game.It Is Actually Worth Money.I Highly Reccommend This Game.Once u Play It U Will Love it
15442,"Why playing this shitty mobile app port when you can play the ACTUAL PC game...

This was dissapointing."
15443,"its pretty good
"
15444,"      Ok, first of all, this game was designed for  mobile  devices. Most of the negative reveiws are because its not as good as world of tanks. Well duh! Of course its not as good! It was made for phones/tablets! The thing is though, that even if you don't take that into account, it's  still  a  great game. It has great mechanics, its easy to use, and its not pay to win.

"
15445,good game
15446,Just play wot instead
15447,"a good tank game
"
15448,Russian bias xaxaxaxaxaxaxaxaa))))))
15449,"Conclusion: Leveling your tanks in World of Tanks Blitz feels like leveling a World of Warcraft character from 1 to 110. But without fun, variety, options, equipment, professions, crafting, story lines, lore, quests, npc's, battlegrounds, dungeons and raids. Just the same pvp-grind over and over again. The physics engine is lacking as well. Any building larger than a hut will laught at your shells or your tank ramming it."
15450,"Play for free? - Yes
Worth paying for in game - No

This game is a fun game to play, so if you have money to waste for add in features on buying tanks or other bonuses...not worth it. I got ripped off from Wargaming.net. They just give you very little for so much you put into this game!"
15451,I like it
15452,"i have no sound for this game...and no help
"
15453,it's a good game but order for you get some where you need to spend money like alot of money
15454,"хрень 
"
15455,N.I.C.E :)
15456,"This is a more-casual World of Tanks version.
It's 7 vs 7, the map is smaller than the original one, and the game is fast paced.

So, this is a casual time killer for good.
Moreover, This game is like World of Tanks on low graphics setting.
I like it tho."
15457,"First off, this is the mobile version of WoT. You can play this on your tablet and phone. If you want the real World Of Tanks download it from the website. This version is just bs."
15458,missing ground textures
15459,"THAT GAME IS SO COOL AND FUN,I CAN PLAY ALL THE DAY ON THAT GAME WITH TANKS
I LOVE IT!! <3"
15460,"nice game ive played it before on my phone. but on pc it has a bug. i dont know if this happens to me only or everyone but when it starts loadin before a match it sometimes laods but most of the time it says program stopped respondind.
but good game and i do recommend this."
15461,"Meh...It's somewhat fun.  Here's my issue:  The game kinda boot-to-the-neck grinds your face.  The tutorial I get...do this, okay now do this.  But after the tutorial, the game still doesn't let you really play to your liking.  It still tells you what you  can do next, which is only ever one option.  Basically, most of the game is click next to continue, and that button moves.  Then you get to battle, yay, then go back to click next to continue.  What's that? You wanted to buy more consumables to help you? Nah, you gotta buy a tank from another country now.  But I wanna upgrade my gun!  Tough, now sell that important thing you probably will need.  But I wanted that, here, let me buy one back from the shop...nah, time for battle!
Fuck that, fuck this game.  If I wanted a comic about tanks/video games, I'da downloaded that."
15462,"very good game, spent hours and hours on it and it never gets boring

EDIT:

It WAS a good game, but like every game they develop, they start creating sh** that never existed and make it so pay to win that even the most ""powerful"" tier X tanks look weak next to their invented ""tanks"" if you like pay to win, this is the game for you"
15463,Its WoT but without Arty :D
15464,"This is review on this really nice game. Now.. where do I start.. Alright, this game is about Tanks (obviously) and is highly recommended to people who are into tanks, or just like competitive games. I absolutely adore this game for numerous of reasons, one of them is how simple and great this game is. You just set your region, log in (through steam preferably), do the tutorial and after just enjoy the battles as you slowly progress and upgrade your tank. This game is really nice visually, and it ALSO supports really low Specs such as my laptop's! 
Here are the proper cons and pros to avoid confusion:
Pros:
-Really simple and fun
-Supports nearly any system
-Its settings allow you to run it on a potato
-Good competitive game

Cons:
-Mostly the community, I've met a bit of ragers and children, but only a bit
-A bit difficult to start with a weak tank compared to all the strong ones.

That's basically all pros I could find.     

Download it now! No credit card, no phone number, no bulls**t."
15465,game very stupid and strange
15466,"to coje za noobacku hru nestahujte si ju !!!!!
"
15467,"Search youtube ""Bushka on Blitz"" learn there play here"
15468,"Awsome game but is there a way to silent the man who keep on saying, ""We didn't penerate thier armour"", We're done for get out"".. etc  and may I suggest that you add the world of warship blitz for this is the game I really want to play but I'm unable to because of its big size memory on its updates,  Thank you ^_^"
15469,This game is just a knock off version of War Thunder. I suggest getting War Thunder instead
15470,"This is terible, downloaded it to play with friends. Turns out it's not even the same game."
15471,Its hard to begin if you don't know what you are doing but after a while it becomes quite easy. You don't have to spend any money to progress but it can take a while if you do not. If you looking for a game you can simply play for a small while a day and slowly progress then this is for you. When you learn the mechanics and where to go on the maps is easy enough. The controls are solid. The graphics are low because it is supposed to be played on a mobile device.
15472,Great Game!
15473,WARTHUNDER DISABLED UNCLE
15474,The worst game ever.
15475,"It's fun at first. For the first 60 minutes.
Then it turns into pay to win."
15476,The game is nice im having a good day i will rate it 9/10
15477,It seems to me a lower and easier version than the regular WoT. Not bad though
15478,"Good game if you don't want to spend any money at all, only downside, other players will drag you down if you have a bad team. I'd recomend paying on lower teirs so that at least you get a chance to win games without much effort from your team. Otherwise, good game and better if you're in a platoon with soneone that knows how to play."
15479,"This game is more cancer than the normal EU version.
WG if you want your game to be good, ban all the cheaters. Especially on Blitz it's very bad.
But well, I assume my review will be removed because every time I complain about cheating, I get banned from chat in WoT. Cheers
So now Steam asked me to revise this review. Well, after an additional 1700 hours, I have this to say.
F*** every single player that uses cheats in this game. I hope every single cheater in this game has a painful and long death with no way out. Using this game to portrait your 2 millimeter dong is just about the lowest form of existence I've ever witnessed. I hope y'all cheating b*stard kids know how to hide. If you want to cheat, go to CS:GO or some sh*t, not this. Nobody needs you."
15480,"ok.ok.ok.OK!! MAN this is shit!
I can say: don't play this, play War Thunder it's better! IN EVERY DAM THING BETTER!!!
"
15481,"A Watered down version of WOT PC with No Arty, Less Physic, rather kind of meh mixture 
should be on Android/Iphones but sure... though it gives kind of slight advantage when PC vs Phones"
15482,"Okay, I have a PC which can't run Minecraft. No joke.
As a low end PC owner, this game is alot of fun for me.
(P2W is a legend to scare kids.)
I have a 1.45ghz processor and a GTX 550Ti GC. and I run the game on 60fps
Just use some brains, memorize the maps and tanks weak spots, find a clan and friends, there's clans using discord aswell. This game is hella fun.

- 666Soulless AKA theworstreviewereverexisted

Peace out."
15483,I hate this game so fucking much i have to deal with shitty teammates and shitty rng why the fuck do i even play this game
15484,I like it but no full version is like WOT wargaming
15485,"So far so good, Played World of Warships from the same company and this is just as good. Definatly playable without spending on micro transactions. Although very enticing to pay to go straight to a higher tier. I'd give a 7.5/10 due to the fact the mobile version of the game is the saem and you add to your credit tallies by playing that too."
15486,"I didn't even get into the main game and already I was disgusted. The graphics were so bad in the tutorial that the treds were speghetti. The turret didn't move, just some jumbled garbage did. Whenever I aimed at the enemy, the whole thing lagged. When I piloted the tank, the response was so terrible that I couldn't reliably drive, already making me think it was a terrible tank game. 

Now, I was going to give this game the benefit of the doubt since my computer is so old. But then I got to the game and tried to change the graphic settings. THEY WERE AT MAX! How can a game like this be able to have such incomplete visuals for a THIRD PERSON SHOOTER! 

I know I should be more compationate since this game is very recent in being developed for a different platform, but it just isn't a good first impression. A few glitches is understandable, but total failure of one aspect is not acceptable"
15487,FUN
15488,This has nice short battles with a pretty easy learning curve to start.
15489,"Amusing diversion, after coming from Big WoT, which is often aggravating for soooo many reasons (other season World of Tanks players will know what I am talking about). The skills are easily transferable, but there are many nice features of this version.

1: Equipment is priced to the tiers of tanks played rather than being one large lump sum. Makes playing lower tier tanks better without having to shell out large amounts of credits, creating a major disparity between seasoned and newer players.

2: Crews are easier to train up and work across other tanks in the same category.

3: Lower tiers are more playable due to higher HPs and more moderate damage, making for more engaing play, whereas in Big WoT low tiers are just there to get through and forget about, or to go back and terrorize less experienced players, which is a dick move.

4: I've barely scratched the surface yet, but the general impression I get is that the Cult of the Stat Whore is not as prevalent here (again, experienced WoT players will know), so it's refreshing.

5: NO ARTILLERY. This is probably THE most appealing aspect for Big WoT players. 

6: More fluid combat. It's just nice to be able to run and gun without having to feel like you need to be Field Marshall Rommel to figure out what the heck is going on. Mini-Map is still important though (and a little hard to read in this version), so that's nice.

It's pretty funny, I got my first Raisainai's Hero's Medal after only playing four games, which was a real chuckle for me. Again, mini-map is still important. A more... palatable WoT experience, kind of like a light beer."
15490,"Great, fun little game... especially if you have an older system or device that can't run the full PC version of World of Tanks.  Check out worldoftanks.com for the full version for PC."
15491,"Has interesting features comparing to the PC version, like easyer approach on making instant elite a newly bought tank, with consumption of gold, ofcourse :P"
15492,Why cant i play this on my phone it was 2 hrs ago now it wants me to update my version..when there is no new update plss.. Fix asap.. Im still working on my blitz fair
15493,"If you played the original wot, this game is definietly not for you...annoying tutorials witch has to be done becouse you don't get the gold, you can't use your emails to register what you used in the original, etc. etc. etc. the gameplay is ok i guess but not that challenging, it is for those red/orange noobs i guess."
15494,szar.
15495,"This game was for me just bad. Yes, I played for a small time but just the tutorial was very weird even for me. An interactive way is how I learn and I get how it works but when handling tanks the response from the tank was slow. This is a very casual game and that is one things that i don't like about it. It felt watered down from another warfare game that features tanks like WarThunder and with that game it felt so much more was involved than in World of Tanks Blitz.
Gameplay is very simple at the start and it was like a quick match tank game that I don't like personally. I can see a peron playing it to be relaxing and just have fun with their friends and just have a great time."
15496,Everything's coming up explodey! - Junkrat
15497,Great game. I personally prefer the original but this game is great for if you don't want to complicated or to big for your computer.
15498,Played original World of Tanks this is nothing great or worth doing.
15499,Fast and fun. Nice short battles.
15500,that new update took my account and i cant login by steam anymore :/
15501,"Better than the other game, moreover it's a totally different game. 

Pros:
No arty
Faster leveling up
Far more updates and events than the other game
Smooth gameplay, the game is not heavy at all
Many vehicles to choose from ( far more to be added on in the future)
7vs7 instead of 15vs15, which makes the matches shorter
Smaller maps compared to the other game

Cons
Graphics ( who gives a shit about graphs, seriously)
Player base is TOXIC as hell. One will say left and all go left, you die you are a noob, you decide then to go right, you die again, you are a noob, the one that said left dies, your team wins, you are a noob again. 

The chat - For some reason you can't type more than 30 letters, hence the chat is in the top middle. They should put it down in the left corner like most games, so writting won't distract players."
15502,"After stopping playing original WOT last summer due to being busy, I decided to relax my brain from the exams and play this game during my winter brake. At first, I found it very strange that the teams are 7 vs 7 and that games usually last only 5 min instead of typical WOT game of 10 min average. Here is what I found great about this game:

- Easy Controls (Identical to WOT)

- No Arty (Pray it stays the same)

- 7 vs 7 which means easy to carry, faster game and people acually play together as a team to win

- Giving away tanks during Christmas Event. This allowed me to grab amazing and rare tanks that I would never get in the normal WOT

- All of the classes of tanks are same matchmaking of +1/-1, which is great as you dont have to be tier 4 playing against tier 6 which you can't pen.

Overall, the game is very fun and addicting, just like WOT was back when I started to play it. I hope that future updates will bring more amazing features and they keep this game original and different from WOT. I will play this game during my free time (winter/spring/summer breaks) as it allows me relax my brain from all of those finals ;_;"
15503,Original world of tanks is better
15504,Just like the main world of tanks but with out having to replace my keyboard every other game. Good riddance arty!!!
15505,"I love it 
"
15506,เล่นมันดีครับ
15507,"i didn't play the original world of tanks and i assume that the original should been better than this. so this game is a fun multiplayer, you got load of tanks of course, satisfying kill, quick game session (this is why it is so addictive), and sometime i scream myself like i was in the game."
15508,Best game tanks ever
15509,"After playing WoT for well over a year I tried this one. and it is all most as bad as WoT's.
 If you like bad matchmaking ( putting new unexperianced players against high level players so they can run up thier score)
then play this. and then there are the cheats, well I geuss some games have them, good games don't, this one has plenty to hurt you. 
 and the best yet, if you like f2p having fun and enjoying yourself, better stay away. it claims f2p, but unless you pay them you will never get in any good matches, just like WoT. (russians hate folks having fun).  
 So play if you want, see for yourself.
"
15510,"This is a very good WOT game...If you don't have a great computer, this game will still run perfectly!!"
15511,In game only 2 unique players can play that means i and my two friends cant play together
15512,Fun game.. cant wait for them to fix all bugs.
15513,"The community is made of monkeys 90% the whole team rushes off left or right just to get surounded and shoot to death, no strategy, no brain, no cover for the one trying to play normally.

Mechanics are fine except the module damaging thing: if you hit a certain part you can damage that (tracks etc) but if you manage to pull that off you deal 0dmg with that shot, some tanks have 10s+ reloads and even when you hit you get 0dmg...... Also the damaged modules can be reapired with kits instantenously!"
15514,"Some tanks are arguably a bit unbalanced or overpowered when compared to others. Since this is the Blitz version of the normal World of Tanks game on the PC (this game was orginally on mobile devices for those who didn't know), the maps are smaller than on the original game. Because of this, tanks with great firepower are at somewhat of an advantage. These tanks usually don't have great gun handling to balance this, but with the shorter distances that tanks fight each other, gun handling doesn't matter as much since you'll hit your opponenents anyway.

A huge warning about this game: the community is, overall, nothing short of garbage. You will hear the typical, ""noob"", ""eat shit"", and ""fuck you"" in just about every match you play in. The average age of players here is lower than in the PC game, so expect annoying little kids every once in a while as well. Also expect angry Mexicans yelling at you because you can't carry your horrible-ass team (you'll be able to tell by their clan tag).

I would actually recommend getting this game from the Windows Store, as it seems to load up and exit a bit faster than here. You can also minimize the game if you have the Windows Store version, so that's pretty convenient. I've played about 300 hours of this game on there, so I didn't really bother uninstalling it and reinstalling on here."
15515,"Very good and well balanced to start with, when you are going through teir I and II. then teir III it's not the tanks that are unbalanced, it's the teams. You will very rarely get a balanced game since so many younger players are playing it.  I'll just go through a few pros and cons

Pros-

can work on low end computers

I found that even with my crappy internet connection (I live in the middle of no-where) that I don't lag at all.

heaps of tanks 

armour system, creates a little more depth to the game, getting to know where you can penetrate armour on different tanks.

5 countries and each are relatively balanced. (though each country seems to have a strength of a different kind)

quick but intense games.

doesn't take too long to get to good tanks.

Many maps to play on.

has a damage system (if your track gets hit it can break, imobilising you for a short period of time) with your many different modules





Cons-

it's spotting system, you can see a tank and it just disseapears (usually happens at a great distance) you shoot where they where standing but does not hit.

bad matchmaking, your team will be full of nubs whho just wanna stand out in the open with no cover and stay still, dying..

if your team  is skilled then it's a pretty good bet that the opposing team is going to die very fast. Only about a third of the time will you have a decent fair game where you will be fighting for your life and being good at it :)

for people with higher end computers I don't think you can change the graphics settings.

Got one shot in a heavy class tank from my most armoured angle???

Oh well! I love it! it's free and very addictive!"
15516,"this game is epic but not like proper world of tanks on xbox 360 but it's still cool keep updateing it that would be cool
"
15517,Awsome! I never knew a free game could be so fun and addictive.Never laged once so far.
15518,"Great mobile adaptation of World of Tanks for phones and underpowered computers/laptops. If you have a good PC for gaming, I would recommend the full game on PC."
15519,a lot of micro transaction and pay to win
15520,"best cross platform game. 
git gud & carry.
platoon every time.

"
15521,"good one to play, with good grphics, playability, and lots of tanks to choose.
there's time when you plays with newbies who seems don't know team play at all, or even no tactics and so. but it still a lot of fun.
Joining clans is kinda bit off for their requirements, but will give a lot of benefits on the long run.
So anyone who decide to try and play, please enjoy it, and if love it, let's play together."
15522,"i found few hacker in the game and they one shoot it as then i rage quit it and smash my pc screen DAMN you...

but if you dont meet a hacker in the game thats great...

5/10"
15523,I played world of tanks at PC and many devices. The game is so addicting with over 200 + tanks to play and collect. Good for platoon with friend and Free time !
15524,"I find this game generally more fun than the regular WoT (1100+ hours played).
The individual player's skill matters much more due to the smaller scale of the battles and the lack of artillery.
Of course it doesn't have as much content as the full game, but the more relaxed and forgiving gameplay make the game an enjoyable experience."
15525,its similar to the pc world of tanks but blitz u can even play it on your mobile phone highly recommend u guys to play
15526,"Hell yes! Controlwise and other stuff, it's fantastic, if you're here for graphics, hard luck. If you're aiming at an enemy, but need to turn your tank in sniper mode, the turret stays fixed at that position, not following the body, which is excessively helpful. The gameplay is amazing, maps are smaller and game times are smaller than the original world of tanks, but this is really fun because it gives you an average of 500xp per 6 minute match, I really enjoy these matches as the queue time is nearly none. (0-2 seonds).

What I like the most is the fact that it's easier to communicate and there is only two gamemodes. So I say a big, big big big big big big big big big big big biig BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGG yes to this thing"
15527,"Good game, but it always gives you the SHITTEST teammates ever."
15528,"This game is a good concept and idea, however following recent updates this game has reached pay to win territory. with the recent introduction of op permium tanks (tanks hat cost real money to get) and anime tanks, combined with the toxicity of players, the game is now some what unplayable. majority of the tanks shown in the trailers and thier cammos all cost money and the premium currency , gold, wich also costs money to get.this game is dying the the developers know it so they are just trying to milk as much money out of people before it does."
15529,"Just an absolute peice of crap game and almost looks as if someone took a random person and told them to progame a ""good"" game. To be honest getting War Thunder is better in multiple ways.
1.better graphics
2.tanks AND planes
3.easier skill tree
4.better controls
5.NOT PAY TO WIN"
15530,"+This is just a warthunder 0.1 with no graphics and bad camera, if you want all of the things this game has  + more, just play warthunder, its a lot more optimized than this."
15531,"A big fan of Wolf of Tanks, but lost interested after i realised the matchmaking was horrible, losing money after each round, having to buy gold and bundles in order to have a chance in the game, i would recommend it to people who are looking for a small 6v6 match, but it really should be 12v12,makes it more fun.

My first review as well, but i don't recommend it to people who are looking for a game with good matchmaking, and not pay 2 win. For that i recommend Warthunder, ticks off everyone you want nearly..
Fun game but lost my interest"
15532,"It`s a good free tank game.It has a lot of tanks,and good gameplay."
15533,"its and okay and pretty good game over all, pretty much the same as the moble version eh"
15534,"This is a good game, but unless you are willing to dump $20-$100 a month into the game. It becomes almost unplayable past tier 5. even if you just pay for premium it is not enough. You need to buy all the premium ammo and consummables to be competative. It was like that on the full version of the game and it's that way here too. Great way to make the game profitable for the company but can chase away those that want a good tank game without dishing out $1000 plus per year.
This is basically a pay to win game. 

Now I'll sit back and watch the trolls and fan boys attack me. :)

and just to make it fun i recommend the game  to those with deep pockets and don't to those who don't."
15535,"[though this shows 60 or smth hours in the game, I actually have 20k+ battles in it using iPad and just recently switched to PC version]

I don't understand how people prefer WoT over WoTB - this game is so much more fun (i played both). Main advantages over WoT:

1) Everything is at leaset twice cheaper in WoTB - for example IS6 costs $20 rather than $40, for $50 you get 16k gold vs 14.5k and anual premium account without discount here costs only 16k vs 24k in WoT. 

2) Grind is soooo much shorter. With premium account you can have 100% crew in tier 4 in like 5 battles. In WoT it will take you 20 or more. And then you have skillless crew which will be another 50 battles for the first skill. If you like being tortured in a tank that is way bellow it's full capaticty FOREVER be my guest. I like the game where skill matter over the dumb hours put into the game grinding the same d**n tank, therefore i'd like my tank to get to it's full capacity ASAP. In here you can have T10 fully trained in like 150 or 200 battles (if i recall correctly 25% * 9k xp per 1 percent)

3) Battle mechanics much more fun - you can actually survive a stupid mistake once in a while where as in WoT you are insta-dead. 

4) Ofcourse the battle time and smaller maps are much more fun - you don't have to wait 15 mintues until enemy hunts down your useless hiding teammate who is left 1 vs 5 being single shot without a chance to win. In here only t8-t10 battles take 5-7 minutes, small tiers are usually done in 2-3 :) If you are slow yourself I suppose stick to WoT, if you like fast paced game go to WoTB. (cs vs q3:ca people?)

5) Consumable/ingame equipment prices - here again.. multipurpose kit in wotb costs like 5k, in wot its 50k ... in smaller tiers even on premium account its 5 won battles before you can afford one in wot. In wotb its no brainer to use these. Single repair kit in wotb fixes all broken equipment (just doesnt heal the crew) as opposed to fixing single broken piece in wot.

6) Don't get me started on arty :)

I suppose the only people who post negative comment about this game after spending 0.5h on it are those who suffered long years in WoT constantly [b]losing in undertrained tanks[/b] and now they want you to [b]suffer the same misery as they did[/b]."
15536,Good Game
15537,"I prefer this game a lot over the actual World Tanks for a few reasons:
1. Games are more appropriately timed (Not twenty minutes in the PC version, this usually lasts five minutes)
2. Community isn't toxic
3. Easier to progress
4. There aren't so many good players like in the original version, so you actually have a chance to learn how to play well in this
5. Matches are actually fairly created in this where in the original if you're at the bottom, you're probably screwed. This game gives you a guaranteed fighting chance."
15538,Gold ammo.
15539,nope.
15540,Recomend
15541,"Highly recommended, started playing the game as an Andiord Beta Tester. Love the smaller teams and lack of Artillery, I then moved on to the Windows 10 Version App Version. Then Low and Behold the Pc version came out on Steam All Hail Steam, Love the Steam Wallet Purchase Feature plays far better on Steam Slick and Silky Smooth and no more windows 10 app glitches sending me to tablet mode on pc. This Scaled down version of the Pc is more appealling due to team sizes and quicker progression thru the tech tree. A game that won't disappoint for the avid tank player!"
15542,The shiti game ...
15543,nice game
15544,Gets shot on the end of a track *boom* whole tank blows up
15545,I love this game but please make it easy to get credits and exp for high tier.
15546,"shitty shit game. makes you really want play but the pay-off is not worth the time, unless you you have lots of money to throw away."
15547,A ball of fun as it is quick and even if you die early the wait is short until the next game. Hilarious mix of incompetent to good players makes ths game fun. No need to buy much gold to play if you don't mind a few class grinds.
15548,love WOT
15549,Lovely
15550,"This game gets a lot of hate for being a mobile port and not the full WoT experience but having played both I can tell you this is just a different game. There's no artillery, the maps are small, and matches go very quickly because of it. 

You still get your WoT mechanics with penetrations, armor thicker in front, angle of attack deflections, module damages, ammo rack explosions, and crew damage based on hit locations but in a slim fast paced fun design. And never more or less than 7 people per team. 

All in all it's a really fun game for what it is.
"
15551,great game i really love it. especially with rare tanks only being 12 bucks a peice.
15552,"i have more fun in wot bliz than wot pc. plus the tanks are better balanced.

downside. the graphics dont get near wot pc in full configs. but it is a lot better programmed so you can play it with 60 fps in high config even with a shitty pc"
15553,an awesome game! i've played on my android too
15554,Like that WoT
15555,"This Game is Perfectly Bullshit Than The normal World Of Tank
I Took 4 Min just to finish my loading screen to play enter the Battle. When i Joined My Tank Already Blown Up LMAO SHIT HEAD.

HOW COULD I PLAY THIS GAME CORRECTLY IDOT SHIT PATCH"
15556,love it
15557,"I couldn't play the game because there's some thing wrong with it.
It's hard to explain, but it made my eyes hurt and gave me slight headache.
It felt like camera projection was not perspective or idk just felt wrong or maybe it was the way camera zoomed in or the FOV is wrong, i can't put my finger on it exactly, but it made me uncomftrable."
15558,cocky game. 11\10 for sure
15559,"look, i like this game and all its fun too, but fucking seriously? you give noobs a fucking op sucky tank?! and fucking critical hits everywhere and its not fun playing with noobs who just finished the tutorial and get a op tank that can one shot everything. the people who are working on this game are retarded, i would highly recommend playing war thunder. their tanks are more realistic and more... more.... more based off of ww1 or 2. and their maps are big asf too"
15560,I think its too bad that steam features a mobile game on their application for pc while there is a pc version for free. The PC version is better in every way except artillery.
15561,"The matching system for this game is crap.... There is a world of difference between the tiers of the tanks, and the game constantly places teams of a higher tier, with a lower tier set of players.
Other than that, it's a HUGE grind for EXP... which is your currency needed to buy tanks and upgrades.

I am trying VERY hard to like this game, but the match making is stupid and broken."
15562,that awesome tank battle but increase gold reward after battle
15563,"This game is probably great for cocaine users. You may leave a battle after being destroyed, go straight into another one without waiting for the previous to end. Its a rush."
15564,A Very Good Game Trust Me 100% Awesomeness.    :D
15565,Good game but i still want in multiplayer random games - 10 vs 10 mode
15566,You want to play World if Tanks? Yes. Your PC can't play the original Max Setting? Yes. This is suitble for you
15567,kv-1s/kv-2 would get one shot again.
15568,Awesome game. great graphics and action. definatlly reccomend..
15569,The game is a money grab. Used to some 5 years ago it was good but they have completely destroyed it - unless you got $1000 then don't play - that should buy you 10 tanks...
15570,"u guys have to update it
"
15571,This game is good. It is great. Get it. Get it now. Get it.
15572,Boring. This game is not fun for me. It may be easy to play but it is hard to get used to.
15573,"I can't get any of my old data back
"
15574,"I've played this game for years and I still come back to it every so often. Much faster paced than the normal WoT, which is something I really appreciate."
15575,"WoT blitz is a great game and is the only succesful tank war game out there on steam or iOS platforms. the game has very good diversity like france, Soviet union, UK, Germany, USA, and Japan tanks. it includes light tanks, tank destroyers, mediums, and heavies throughout the game. the game takes awhile to beat and gets progressively more difficult as you progress through the ""levels"".

something people would look for is gameplay with friends. if you love tanks but want to battle other people with tanks, WoT is your game. it offers platooning which is basically you teaming with your pal or family member to fight other people in this battling multiplayer.

this game also offers many iconic tanks many people would recognize like the M4 sherman and it's variants, the IS-3 and it's variants, and many other ineteresting prototypes that most people don't know about. i would very much agree to play this game also because it has little violence meaning if younger people want to play this game parents, i would let them.

another thing to consider is graphics and compatiability. weak and old computers/devices can play this too. and if you have a gaming PC it offers HD graphics and sound. 

They also have training rooms fr you to explore, train, or do other stuff on the game just in case you get tired of battling. i would definetley reccomend thuis game"
15576,"Best game ever




For testing your uninstall button"
15577,"First Impressions:
You can remap the keys, an essential. Graphics were good. Explanations were not.Just buttons that glow and a few words, but no real sense of what was going on, except that every click made my money/points (if that's what they are) go down. Won the first three battles, was forced to click get another country's tank, got it, spent a lot more; then came my first battle as a Russian runabout, I was chasing an enemy tank around a building when a shot came out of the distant mountains (it left quite the white smoke tracable line) and totally destroyed my tank, one hit. No tank in sight at the source of the shot.
I rebooted - earier to delete the game that way."
15578,Where is the controller support? lol My mousepad is worn... make this game compatible with a Controller
15579,"Pretty good, shouldn't be compared to original World of Tanks as it is much faster and less complicated.
More of an arena/arcade tank game than a sim."
15580,i would love this game if there was a free skin for each tank on world of tanks blitz but in all i love the game and highly recommmend it 100%
15581,This game makes me miss playing war thunder
15582,I am a fan of World of Tanks before this product came out. There is plenty of difference between the two. Graphic wise since this game mostly played on mobile platform so there is plenty of cut in there. Gameplay didn't have much change and the grind level become lower.
15583,All good in the hood.
15584,"Very fun game, has a lot of things you can do."
15585,"Pros:
-performance-wise it runs smooth on old PCs
-matches are short, which is great if you don't have a lot of time to spare
-grind-wise tier1 to tier4 was a breeze so far
-playerbase is good, you can find a match in mere seconds
-no artillery (this is a plus for me)
-free2play with only minor pay2win mechanics

Cons:
-graphics-wise it looks dated
-fewer tanks and maps than in regular WoT
-presence of premium tanks and premium shells (though I rarely ecountered them)"
15586,bad
15587,If you love War Thunder but wish for a more UNBALANCED version
15588,good
15589,"What I have learned from this game is,
 WOT Blitz is a PAY TO WIN GAME.
 
First they will make you addicted if you are a good player and then you will see the DIRTY TRUTH beneath this so called free to play game. After playing for a while, you will see Pz ll j, BT-SV, Dracula, Type 62, Type 62 Dragon, T 54 MOD, LUPUS ,Type 59 and so on with way too much mobility,armor,fire rate,damage and health than any other similar tank has.

 Only LTTB is the tank that seems good against premium tanks(pay to win tanks). I will discourage anyone to play this game. You guys rather play LEAGUE OF LEGENDS, DOTA or any other games."
15590,It's a lot of fun..enough said!
15591,"It's actually more fun than WoT because (1) No Arty, (2) Games start faster and so does the action."
15592,"For this game being a mobile port, it runs nice and smooth and the game graphics not to shabby either. Since you can link both accounts with your sign in. You can take it on the go with you!!! Which is a A+ for me!"
15593,pretty shit if i must say
15594,No tank type balencing I.E team of 3 light tanks and 3 tank destroyers VS 2 medium tanks 2 tank destroyers and 2 light tanks.
15595,can you access your account on this game from like world of warships?
15596,"the game is interesting and frustrating.  The Cons, 1st and foremost is that the app runs a script on the local PC that gives the game root/administrator priviledges.  NO game requires root priviledges.  If it does then something else is going on in the background not visible to the player or it is poorly written.  Either way you should not load to your PC if you use that PC for anything other than browsing the web (i.e., you should not be doing banking, personal emails etc).  

If the root admin priviledge has not turned you off to the game then there are other reasons to not want the game. 

1st are other players.  I am too often matched with other players who stay back or hide until everyone else has been eliminated before coming out to fight.  Next is the player who's only purpose is to keep other players from moving or fighting by using their tank as a shield to block firing or to use as a battering ram to push smaller tanks off cliffs, behind rocks and so forth.  3rd is the game mechanics themselves.  There is so little consistency in suffering damage as to make it impossible to know how and when to stand and fight.  In one game I took over 1000 hit point above my tanks rated survival.  In the next game I am hit twice by a tank, who's damage rating is an avg at 30 hp per shot (using premium shells), but yet two shots destroys my tank even though it has a HP factor of 200......go figure.  

4th are the sighting rules which makes trying to dodge a bullet nearly impossible.  If real physics are truely being used, I as a tank commander will not fire a gun unless I can see the enemy tank.  If my sighting capability is 250 yards and my target is at 400 yards, the fact that one of my fellow team mates is only 200 yards from the same enemy tank should not mean I can see it to hit it.  It just means I know approximately where a tank sits.    Then there is the silouetting of a tank that is otherwise obscured by trees or bushes but again because a team player is closer to it I have the unrealistic ability to see it clearly enough to shoot at it. 

5th is again the sigting rules.  Too many times I have been parked well behind a stone building that should block my visibility by the enemy tank only to be eliminated by him because his point of view has me sitting past the edge of that same builiding.  

If your looking for a quick and easy game to play as a diversion and do not mind these flaws, it can be a fun game.  But I strongly suggest you not waste your money on buying tanks, premium time or anything else that would require spending real money.  You are wasting your time and money."
15597,"Works great, nice graphic, special beautiful tanks like Panzer IV Anko Special or Tiger Kuro Mori Mine and no artillery ^_^
"
15598,Many tanks. Nice game. [table][tr][th]Best Tank[/th][/tr][tr][td]T14[/td][/tr][/table]
15599,"Decent game... 
why hate, if you play wot pc then dont come here
i dont even play wot pc, warthunder is the best with logic

wot blitz is good low game that even my crappy laptop can play, and really quick paced and casual
what do you expect? wot pc on mobile? 

i dont see any short coming since its mobile game that have to keep things minimum and of course its only casual games at best and cant be compared to real medium to high end pc games
i recommend to play on phone/tablet too because you can play it when you are not near your pc/laptop when you're bored at someplace

7/10"
15600,"As someone who has put hundreds of hours into regular World of Tanks, this game fell astonishingly short. It takes the game of World of Tanks, and makes the teams about half as big. But what really sucks is it takes WOT and makes it way more cartoony, and childlike, and removes the artillery tanks. That, on top of the smaller teams, makes this a super fast-paced version, and takes out a lot of the strategy, replacing it with ""skill"" 

If you liked the game of World of Tanks, but it was too slow-paced for you, or you hated artillery, this is for you. Otherwise, if you are/were an avid WoT fan, this game will probably disappoint."
15601,"Having a blast with this game.  Battles are fast and fun, tech trees are great to explore.  Fully recomend."
15602,Just a port of a mobile game that is already a watered down version of the regular world of tanks game
15603,war thunder tank fights but more no one shot pre kv2 and much more tank+ can play on your phone if you cant bring your pc with ya
15604,"Great game if you're looking to play ""Worl Of Tanks"" but can't run it on your system, its very smooth gameplay, with many vehicle to choose from!! AWESOME"
15605,"World of Tanks Blitz is largely the same as World of Tanks, which can be counted as a older brother to Blitz. Gameplay wise is quite similar with the older patch of World of Tanks physics, gun shoot sounds, armour profiles and etc. Both of them are F2P and grinding the top Tier 10 tank without any premium tanks or premium account is possible as long as one plays smart and saves credits.

Compared to Warthunder, Blitz falls on the arcade type of game which is much easier to play and master than Warthunder due to the more smaller learning curve, although Warthunder gives a higher sense of pleasure after you have fully mastered it.

The rather major difference compared to World of Tanks is the lousier graphics which means a better frame rate for slower computers. Also, one will note that unlike World of Tanks, Blitz does not have artillery or Self-Propelled Guns because of its smaller map size, faster gameplay and shorter match time which makes implementing arty impossible. Then people will ask: Will the developers implement artillery into the game next time? The answer is No, unless they make special matches with longer match times and bigger maps which I think is not going to happen. Another point to note is that its faster gameplay makes tanks with a certain amount of mobility play more aggressively and become able to keep up with the pace of the battles much easier.

Overall, if you are looking for a quick multiplayer tank game that is easier to play than World of Tanks, then Blitz is great for you. If you are a hardcore fan of tanks and would want to try something much harder, then Warthunder(intermediate skill and F2P), Steel Armour: Blaze of War(high detail and big learning curve, same for the other two listed) along with Steel Beasts and Steel Fury: Kharkov 1942 are good games to try with thier higher realism.

Here are some tips for people who are starting in Blitz.
1. Take a look at the tech tree and see which top Tier tank is appealing to you. Then plan which tank line you would want to take towards that Tier 10 tank. Note that some top Tier tanks have only one tank line to choose.
2. After that, I would recommend people grinding the Russian medium tank line because they are rather easy and fun to play with. Or you can choose a tank line which has tanks with good enough mobility like the IS heavy tank line. You can also choose not to grind any Russian tank if you prefer sniping(Germany) or would rather be a jack of all trades(US). It is the best to avoid the British tank line because they are one of the hardest tanks to play in my opinion.
3. Dont use premium ammunition(as in ammo that can be bought for credits but in a very large amount of credits compared to your standard ammo either because they have higher penetration against armour or deals more damage against enemy tanks) unnecessarily but only use it when you cannot penetrate the enemy tank with standard ammo and etc. Also, dont buy provisons and camouflage for a tank you are using it to grind a hefty amount of credits as the result would most likely be a loss of credits or only a few hundred plus credits even if you had a great battle.
4. Lastly, have fun and dont get angry about a match. If ever in a bad mood, take a break and play again later. This can help you concentrate and perform better in battle.
5. Dont forget to learn techniques to use your tank more effeciently. You can find that out with the forums or youtube videos. World of Tanks forums and videos also applies to Blitz."
15606,"Played it mostly from my mobile and Win10 Store. So glad it arrived to Steam. 
Fast sessions, fun gameplay and fair combat mechanics with almost no benefits for payers."
15607,"Great game. You don't have to pay a lot of money to be able to get far in it, but there are major issues how it sorts players into games. There have been several times that really new players have been put into teams against really experienced players."
15608,gg
15609,"Just play WOT, why they didnt brig the orginal WOT to steam is beond me.

this is basically a worse verion in every way. its for dam phones!!"
15610,Update 5.5 has killed the game. It's not fun anymore.
15611,it's World of Tank but easier
15612,Best game ever
15613,very good game!
15614,Now I can play at work. The best!
15615,"Amazingly intense tank combat! And no artillery, yahoo!111"
15616,very good game. Love developers from Belarus. Go ahead!
15617,7 min battle is excellent to play on lunch break or before going to bed
15618,"Cool, finally can play WoT on my 7-years old laptop!"
15619,"This is a mobile port of world of tanks.
WoT Blitz has been on mobile for a year and if you are on windows 8 or 10 you can find it in the microsoft store. 
Don't play this game. Get the actual PC version off Wargaming.Net and don't waste 3gb on this trash. 
Its utter toss. The only other players are on Mobile and you can unfairly stomp on them. Don't download, I sunk a couple hours into the game to see what it was like. But, if you have a craptop or a potato, this will run 50fps max graphics no problem at all. Spare the pain, the agony and don't download this unholy abomination that is called a PC tank game. 
I would rather listen to 100 layers of Rebecca Black-Friday for the rest of my life (i hate friday by Rebecca Black and she should be shot). Now Imagine this, You are married, you have two children, One is perfectly fine if not strong and resistant, and the other is a deformed, in pain child. 

[h1] Which one would you put down?[/h1]"
15620,Fun to play game. May be too addictive
15621,"Wow its a phone version of a game rly? RLY? 
WoT company be like: Oh lets just put mobile version of the game on steam cuz we are lazy af."
15622,great game !
15623,"repetitive with out too much point or decadent of action 
 too much camping"
15624,Gud
15625,"Im going to give this game a positive review, because for those who dont really care much about the depth of the game, and just want to hop in a tank for a couple mins here and there, its still a pretty fun game, but really if you are looking to get into the game, id say skip blitz, and go DL the full world of tanks game, it has better graphics, more vehicles, bigger maps, and bigger teams...
I myself have switched to WOT, so i probably wont be clocking anymore WOTB time, but i had some fun for free!"
15626,This game is so cool!!!
15627,"DON'T listen to these noobs. this is a great game. its called world of tanks blitz. quicker and smaller games. people don't seem to understand Blitzkrieg.... guy's it's great.

-easy to grind and get tanks
-nice low graphics for slower pc's
-grind at home or away thanks to cross compatibility 
-quicker matches
-same or close tier games (wont ever be a leopard in a tier 7 match) 
"
15628,this game is really cool!!
15629,for some reson it wont let me play
15630,all that needs to be said is its better than war thunder so i give this a thumbs up
15631,"Why would anyone think it'd be a good idea to port a mobile game over to PC when there is a non-watered down version of this very same game? Well, I have no idea to be honest. Why does this game even exist, anyways? It shouldn't be on steam. Don't get this Free to Play, Pay to Win cash-grab kiddy version of the more superior WoT.


-Graphics are total TRASH!
-Total pay to win. All wargaming (or a ❤❤❤❤ed russian company) wants is the money.
-Garage is locked to 30FPS which is stupid.
-Diversity between tiers of tanks is OUTRAGEOUS! You will be raging over you head because of this. They literally have the really small tiers put in with the premium tanks, which is honestly ❤❤❤❤ed in my opinion.
-Very limited chat. Hit Z and there are chat functions but they are very limited. Unless you find out how to type what you want, your stuck with what they give you. So deal.


Unless you have a really old or horrible PC then don't play this game. WoT is superior to this crappy version that fails to even live up to WoT."
15632,"Updated 2022:
-Random Number Generator for hits and misses is heavily rigged depending on tank, crew and other hidden statistic Wargaming will not release.
-Wargaming claims the Matchmaker is agnostic to skill and # of player battles, however they will not release the actual code behind such. You will find you are frequently put on losing team ala low Winrate/UnSkilled players or as the lower tier tank.
-Game's algorithms routinely hand out a string of losses after a string of wins no matter yours or your team's contributions. The majority of damage done in the game is due the RNG, not player skill or tactics.
-Game is heavily monetized and designed to hand out loss after loss to make players feel like they need to buy some ""OP Premium"" tank which is hampered/blessed by the same heavily skewed RNG.
-One day you can achieve 10 wins in a row only the be handed 15 losses in a row afterwards as the algorithm is designed to try and keep players in the median range of 50% winrate.
- Wargaming has admitted in various posts and interviews the game is designed to keep players engaged by handing out wins/losses to give a false sense of achievement or loss ala ""carrot and stick"" mechanics, that again hidden.
-Wargaming will not discuss the fact that the NA and Asian servers are on the verge of being closed down due to low playerbases and might pull the plug anytime w/o warning and no account transfers to existing servers in Europe or Russia."
15633,"What to say, always with updates, a great community, free, and those who say that it is a ""pay to win"", is that they have no idea to play this game. Highly recommend"
15634,xdxdxd Suka Blyat  Recomend DA
15635,"Очень крутая игра просто,нет слов"
15636,"Wargaming puts another dumbed down version if its prime cash cow on Steam. There's still fun to be had, as the core game is similar to the original WoT, just as there is some fun gameplay with the other Wargaming titles. The problem is the lack of new or surprise. Been there, done that, done with the terrible grind. Wargaming just wants to make money, not ""new"" games."
15637,If you are playing in pc dont play this  play the orignal world of tanks. This game is only good for mobile devices.
15638,"It asked me to make an account and I did but after taking me through the tutorial, it asked me to sign in and said my account didn't exist. 1/10 do not recommend"
15639,Нормально
15640,Cool
15641,this game is like a competive type game. you play battle's get xp and coins to buy tanks or for upgrades for the tanks theres all type of tanks like light tanks that are quick at moving. medium tanks are a mix of light and heavy tanks quick and powerful. heavy tanks are the slowest of tanks but do a lot of damage to the enemy's tank and theres tank destoryers that do high damage to all tanks but have low health. the game is fun to play and i would recomend this game to anyone who like these types of games.
15642,"Je to dobrá hra, ale štvě mě když je predemnou nepřítel on mně vidí a ja jeho ne takze je to uplne na hovno!"
15643,"Competetive MMO that moves faster than original WOT .Players more civil and welcoming to new players. Better coop structure less elitest attitudes showing up in game.
"
15644,Awesome free game. Doesnt take long to get some decent tanks
15645,this game is just great. ive been plying since december last year and i love it . so many tanks and so much fun to play with friends.
15646,nice game like the phone version but this better and its on STEAM great :o
15647,"First impressions are very good, perfectly works with intel igpu"
15648,Nice Game
15649,Having trouble. It let me play the trainer then it would just say synchronizing data showing the picture of a tank. let it sit for ours no change. uninstalled and reinstalled several times no luck.
15650,"awesome if you like tanks
"
15651,"Ive never played a game with more rediculus blatant cheating.
In about 400 battles only about 5 shots bounced off my tank when I would bounce almost every battle.
One battle bounced some 6 shot in a row off the same tank while it proceeded to blow away about 2 or 3 tanks near me on my team. Thats not all. The kindness doesnt end here folks. My average dmg was less than 200 enmy ""red"" teams dmg average about 300. I dont know why in the world I even played this game for about 100 hours it is obserd.
Nothing says suicide gives like wot blitz!"
15652,Best game yet has great graphics
15653,"Great graphics, full of action, easy to control and playing against real players instead of a dumb AI. With Free to pay you would expect to have to pay something to win more, but fortunately that is not the case in Blitz. Those who buy premium Tanks have no advantage over those who don't have one. Spending real cash will just let you collect tanks. That's all.
As each game only lasts 7 minutes max. It is great for playing when you have only a few spare minutes. I used to play it on mobile, but completely s^c^^ at that. Since I moved to my laptop my Win Rate dramtically increased. Try both to see which fits you better."
15654,Lmao the hell the mobile version instead of the actual game gg wargaming
15655,"So, looking back now.

Wargaming, the publisher, seems to have realised that the way they have implemented various things is extremely unpopular with the majority of the worldwide player community. That being said, they do not seem to be doing anything to resolve the present issues still in the game, but rather introducing new features in an attempt to distract the playerbase.

Sadly, it is working for the majority of the less mature players.

However, ongoing community efforts are still in effect, and they are hoping to begin a reversal of some extremely unpopular changes to the game, as well as bring about fixes to current in-game issues that can be the difference between a team winning or losing a match.

So, do I recommend this game? Circumstantial.

If you're looking for a quick, easy game, free to play, and don't care about progressing quickly or all the way to the top, yes.

If you are coming from World of Tanks PC version, and are wanting to join the community and become a substansive member of the playerbase, active both online in the forums and in-game, then yes.

However, if you want a game for your child or yourself, wish to progress swiftly, and are unable to/unwilling to spend a large amount of money, then no. This game has a habit, similar to other online MMOs, to suck away your money little by little (in extreme cases, $100 at a time).

If there was a third option marked 'Maybe' for recommendations, that would be ticked. As I play the game still, I will select 'Recommended'."
15656,One of my favorite game
15657,"I'm WoT player (8K+ battles, green WN8) and i've played this game at PC. I can say:

+ new tanks-gaming experience:
      7 players at team
      less nations 
      less tanks lines
      faster game
      MM only +- 1 
      no artillery
      faster 100 % crew 
      6th sense has every crew
      smaller maps
      new perks system
      easier enemy :)
+ new maps
+ new missions
+ modification support
+ steam support
- terrible control (game was created for mobile gaming, not for PC gaming)
- less game settings
- worse graphics
- less information after battle
- stupid ""auto-zoom"" which gonna make you sick
- useless green lines before (and behind) your tank 
- bugs with unzoom
- strange camera near buildings
- another craps taken from normal WOT (for example pay-to-win, really ridiculous RNG, stupid comunnity)

Summa summarum. I dont know, what should i think. This game is maybe good at mobile, but for PC gaming is... at least weird. On the other had, there are no arty and MM is only +-1! I hope Wargaming will add WoT at steam too.

To sum up, I cannot recommend you WoT blitz for PC gaming. Unfortunately.If you like tanks, try World of Tanks, War Thunder or Armored warfare. Definitly not BLitz."
15658,"Good stuff

- FREE
- You can go full weaboo and play as japan with a mini-tank that fires 9999 bullets per second
- Team mates acctualy help?! (60% of the time, the other 60 they just go solo)
- Maps are well made
- A low end pc can run it at 60fps
- Servers are not only great lag-wise but also you only take 1 second to join
- Almost hacker proof


Bad shit

- A little bit P2W (but not much) (you only loose 1 out of 3 battles because of it)
- Physics can go a bit wierd sometimes
- No clans???

Minor bad shit that is not really that bad but it makes you feel like ""ugh"" when you think of it...

- No singleplayer
- No level editor

Overall

10/10 go play war thunder"
15659,"the graphics are great but the maps are small and really they could have done better with the maps . To be perfectly honest the game play reminds me of the old ninetendo duck hunt game, bobbing in and out from behind rocks and things. I catch myself laughing at times when I watch tanks bob up and down back and forth in and out. Surely the developers didn't pattern this game after duck hunt if they did their idiots. Come on develop some real battlefield maps these tanks actually fought on not these 3rd rate maps you have now. It is fun to play but nothing to get serious about. as the maps are a joke and kinda stupid. The developers would have a great game if they could come up with more realistic and larger maps, and the battles lasted longer."
15660,"VERY BEAUTIFUL GAME
PLAY IT"
15661,"although the game is pretty good the game is heavily pay to win and has a fair amount of player hacking on it to shoot through terrain and aimbotting,if you can get past the pay to win players and hackers on the game then play it, but if you find the nonsense of people using third party programmes and emptying their wallets to totally destroy the free to play players then this game isnt for you."
15662,You can get cheated out of your purchases I bought gold and paid 49.99 and it never showed up in my game and they claim  everything is ok on their end and refered me to a third party game developer which got me nowhere
15663,Its fun and fast paced depending on your class but remember this is blitz so certain tanks arent available
15664,"Pay to win really. If you dont pay, you end up with a tank and a team that that has not paid and is bound to loose just about every time. Had one game where i was firering 5-10 shots on tank without making a mark. I just gave up trying.

The fast pace is cool. I didnt loose heart after loosing 5 games in row, but it gets boring to have to play 20 rounds a day just to get that 2x experience on one tank."
15665,"Its great,

I know there are quite a few haters, but WoT Blitz is better than WoT I think, WoT has SPG's and Blitz dose not. This alone changes the game for the far better.

Every death, every loss is explainable, and not caused by a cheeto click.

If you after a fast fun game that plays well and the progress carries over to mobile, well, here you go."
15666,игра хорошая !!!!             и еще хейтеры надоели world of tanks  оскорблять!!!!      спасибо  за игру!!!!
15667,"It is great, fast and fun. But if you want the full WOT experience on PC, I suggest you download the actual game not on steam. But for quick, casual play this is the game for you."
15668,very fun
15669,8.5/10
15670,"Simple, fast-paced version of WoT that can be played on almost any hardware."
15671,worst tank game i have ever played
15672,Good to play while you have a shit!
15673,"Mobile P2W port trash, fkn waste of 2000+ hours"
15674,nice game
15675,Great game because its a chill 10-13 game with no vilence or anything but is still fun
15676,"It is enjoyable, and regardless of if you're a WoT veteran or newbie, you can give it a try and worst case you can always uninstall.
BUT, big BUT here: It is far inferior to the 'original' PC version of the game. No Artillery, less nations, less content overall - and only 7v7. 
Plus, in true Wargaming fashion they try and do whatever they can to milk you for your money. 
Why am I playing this, then?
Because a) a netbook without a graphics card can run it and b) it does have cross-platform gameplay. 
A friend of mine and I tend to team up, one on a netbook, the other one his smartphone. Not the worst feature, for sure."
15677,im so happy that Blitz version run on pcs now ^^
15678,"After 700+ hours, now the game is unplayable due to random fps dropping to 1fps for minutes at a time. Started happening a few weeks ago, ping is less than 15, all other pc games run on ultra just fine, but a ported mobile game gets an update and is now completely unplayable."
15679,"Bottom Line:
- This is fun to play.
- Quick to get a match with other players. 
- Plays on multiple platforms.
- I need more noobs to blow up in-game.

Get your Tank on Commander!!!

*grin* Hope I see you first... in game. ;D

Why am I writing this review?
- It has received ""Mixed reviews"" on Steam.
- I don't want you to miss this game.
- I've played both the full version of WoT & Blitz (this version).
- Just UNISTALLED the full version.
- Played this version on my ipad"
15680,"decent game
pros: 
no artilery
good perfrormand on potato pc
have advantage against mobile users
cons:
its at all wot game
alot of donut
if u dont wanna donut, then u have to spent half of ur life to get all tanks in the game"
15681,"I get called a reroll because my stats are amazing.
I'm a bob on the PC WoT.
10/10 would feel like a reroll again."
15682,1 word BAD
15683,if you are a PC player for WOT do not play this port version unless you want a cheap way to play WOT.
15684,good tank game ever
15685,I love this game I hope more people get it and hope there will be more to come to this game
15686,"Like WOT, but smaller."
15687,Great game!
15688,Don't even bother downloading this pile of horseshit its nothing but an even worse version of WoT. Go play War Thunder.
15689,tanks
15690,Nice game. Keeps you busy a lot of hours.
15691,sranje
15692,"World of Tanks Blitz is basically the fun version of World of Tanks.

I'll try to write this for the second time, because for some reason my overview disappeared, when I clicked ""Post Review"".

Let's mention some things about this game:

[b]Graphics and Artstyle:[/b] Graphically the tanks look great, but in terms of texture sharpness the maps aren't that great (There are a lot better ones available on the mobile platform). However, I really like the interesting skins you can get for your tanks. The artstyle is pleasent to look at, it's somewhere between colorful and realistic - It's also consistent and makes sense.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] The gameplay works smoothly and well on both touch devices and PC. I have not encountered any issues in that regard. With this game the amazing tactical map design makes a return, which Wargaming is known for. 


[b]Conclusion[/b]

World of Tanks Blitz is for, if you want to just have fun and get away from the more serious World of Tanks. You can't directly communicate with anyone in the battle as far as I know, so that makes for a much more pleasent gameplay experience. (I tend to see people insulting each other in World of Tanks in 8 battles out of 10)

The game performs well on a Galaxy Note 10.1 2014, iPad Air 2, and Galaxy S5 Neo, so pretty much any PC should be able to run it."
15693,"Got a draw after rammed a tank in full speed and caused both of us dead
10/10"
15694,BEST GAME IN THE WORLD 10/10
15695,"Finally! No need windows 8 or 10 to play it, Now I can enjoy the PC version of Blitz with the graphics setting on high."
15696,"Of all the games I have played for free. This game is one I'd actually pay for. I love yes I said love, I really enjoy this game. I seriously cannot get enough of it."
15697,Diet World of Tanks
15698,It's a great game why put the mobile version on steam instead of the pc? I guess it you have a slower computer that can't handle the pc version but I don't see a reason people would play this if they can just play the orignal. In my opinion the mobile version is better than war thunder just like the orignal but other than the y tho it's a great game
15699,World of tanks blitz is a pretty great game if your into tanks. I have an update suggestion; Could you add in the artillery/self-propelled guns? I really like them. Thanks!
15700,after 6 mission still got told do this or that didnt let me pick what tank want next or anything i not want play game that treat you like a kid need told play the way they want stick to war thunder!
15701,"It's fairly repetitive and doesn't have much depth to it, but it's fun for quick and painless fun."
15702,"It's a great game, overall. The graphics are nice, the port is nice, though I will say I'm bummed that their is no different indicator for being hit, (i.e., the difference in sound when a 150mm hits you, or when a 122mm hits you), like WoT PC.

I love the 7v7 battles, too.

Basically, if you like WoT PC before it got wierd and too complicated, like when the KV-85 was actually the KV-1S that only gets the 122mm, then you will like this game. I love it and it's great."
15703,"it really isn't good if you want a game like this, GET WAR THUNDER NOW FOR  FREE NOT PAY TO WIN!!!!!"
15704,"Good game, for me is better than pc version world of tanks cuz in wot blitz good balance, 7x7, and has not f**king artillery!
I like this game.
My Valuation is 8/10"
15705,"Love this game, I had played WoT B on my phone for several years, but i only recently picked up this version of it, and it is phenominal.  The controols on a computer are far easyer than that of a phone or tablet, and the only thing that could use some love is the key bindings to the signals.

Other than the signals this is a greal all arround game."
15706,"This is a GREAT game!  Problems: 
1)  You get up to level 6 before you realize what tanks you SHOULD have gotten in the 1st place at level 1.  : ( 
2)  Many ppl do not understand strategy, 'flanking', and the battle as it changes.
3)  Many ppl's plan is 'You Only Live Once' (YOLO).  They rush ahead, get into trouble, call for help over & over, die, and you die if you try to help them.  
"
15707,"Not the best version, the full version for pc is better."
15708,Shitty version of World of Tanks because its literally the mobile version emulated on PC. (Get the regular game from their website its waaaaaaay better)
15709,even more retarded than wot on pc
15710,"Have you ever been playing the original World of Tanks and thought to yourself, ""this is alright, but I just wish the controls were shit?"" GOOD NEWS!"
15711,"10/10 this game is good from older pc
"
15712,I played this game for years in the solo client.... so glad it has made it to steam as its genius is in its implicity. Love it!
15713,Тащить- Донатить....
15714,"I actually enjoy this version of World of Tanks more than the PC only version.  In Blitz all of the frustating parts of the game have been removed: artillary, fight two tiers above your own, extremely long grinding, and high cost for tanks and equipment.  Becasue of the smaller maps, and shorter time limit team-mates cannot just camp the whole game.  This makes for a much more dynamic game.  Who cares if it is a mobile port.  Runs great on my HP laptop."
15715,"As an avid gamer and a person with high interest in tanks, I enjoy playing these types of games by default. Jumping into this game from online games like Tanki Online, the original World Of Tanks, or mobile games like Tank Domination, this game was like putting on an old glove, easy to learn and pick up the fundamentals. I really enjoy the gameplay, and I think the matchmaking system was a huge upgrade from other online platforms I used to play with. The realistic gameplay, the quality graphics that can be run on lower-quality systems, and the tanks themselves were real sellers for me. Even though I miss tanks like the British Challenger and the American Abrams, I think the arsenal of tanks available is a definite plus, with more on the way.

All in all, I think this is a game worth the time, and I will recommend it."
15716,"Played a bit, can recommend tho"
15717,amazing
15718,"I only recommend it for new World of Tank comers. Because the Original version of the game has so much to offer. While I will say (for me at least) the control is slightly smoother and the graphics a little better then on the Original, the original has more tanks (including artillery which is absent on this version), more players, longer battles which is good for experts and has a few more features that I won't emphasize on. It's a fun game though. But I would strongly recommend getting the Original whenever you decide upon it."
15719,"They took away half the tanks from the game and with it went half the fun! They are trying to simplify the game for new players by removing more ""specialized"" tanks and thus removing more specialized play styles. By doing this they screwed over veterans like myself. Not to mention the immense amounts of greed that Wargaming is presenting with both this game and all of their other games that just makes me sick to my stomach. I've Been playing since 2014 on plenty of different platforms but Wargaming has finally lost me with their anti-consumer buissness practices completely throwing old players into the wind."
15720,best free game i have ever played
15721,it is better than it looks
15722,Good Game!
15723,I like this game! better than the orginal vesion of WOT
15724,great exchange for orginal wot
15725,pacat ca nu sunt playeri sa inteleaga jocul
15726,"funny game but i would rather recommend to play the ""real"" wot game :)"
15727,"I don't understand, why mobile game on PC when it's, & so on... other pc. 
Top game, as well as all of the Wargaming, except of WarThunder ofcourse :D
Thanks."
15728,"THERE ONCE WAS A FUN GAME
The game has gone full pay to win
For fans of the genre 2/5"
15729,"Not too bad, fun and would recomend if you like a casual few games a day"
15730,Much better then the original.U will have to get used to grinding thought
15731,"Regular World of Tanks just watered down, no arty, and made more cartooney.  There just isn't much reason to play this instead of the original."
15732,CAN THIS GAME STOP HAVING CONNECTIVITY ISSUES FFS. 300 PING EVERY DAY I PLAY. GOOD JOB YOU MONEY HUNGRY GARBAGE. GET ALOT OF WHALES BUT STILL BLAME CONNECTION ISSUES ON PLAYERS RATHER THAN ACTUALLY FIXING SERVERS.
15733,"trash graphics, installing WOT instead of WOTB is much better, trust me, you wont have to look at 8 bit tanks killing eachother."
15734,"This game gets a lot of hate for being a mobile port and not the full WoT experience but having played both I can tell you this is just a different game. There's no artillery, the maps are small, and matches go very quickly because of it. 

You still get your WoT mechanics with penetrations, armor thicker in front, angle of attack deflections, module damages, ammo rack explosions, and crew damage based on hit locations but in a slim fast paced fun design. And never more or less than 7 people per team. 

All in all it's a really fun game for what it is."
15735,"Its a fun game, all the people here whining about how its boring/ unfair are prob the same people that play ios games like theyre console quality"
15736,"this game is garbage, terrible controls, slow gameplay, and overall BORING"
15737,"The availability of the full WoT experience shouldn't really matter. Blitz is an excellent game in its own right and can coexist as a more arcadey, fast experience alongside the bigger and far more serious original. I've spent many, many hours in the tablet and phone versions and while the UI could use some tweaking to be more mouse friendly overall it's still a very fun game with a reasonably fair business model here on the PC. Bonus points for allowing you to carry your account and play across multiple devices, and running on any PC built in the last decade."
15738,"It's a PC port of Mobile port of PC port game.
Also, there's console port."
15739,Not bad.
15740,"I don't understand why people dislike this game. I know this is not World of Tanks, but a pocket/mobile version of it, hence the name World of Tanks Blitz. I've been enjoying the game. If you want to enjoy the game think about it as a fast-paced game."
15741,"Its pretty cool, like some features of it (such as no SPGs)."
15742,Bad graphics and mechanics...
15743,"Its a nice game, better than Wot because wot can sometimes be brutal but their is one thing i hate about this game, its the money system i keep loosing money, i didn't even use my abilities nor get killed in early rounds seriously the money system here can sometimes be annoying loosing a big amount of money. But the game is really fun, playing with friends is what i like the most"
15744,"The BEST free Tank Shoot'in, Tank Dive'in (Tank Cliff Jumping), Demolish and Destroy, Mission Acomplished!"
15745,Nice game
15746,"Most of the negative reviews are about World of Tanks not being here, instead of Blitz.
You can ignore those, as they make no sense at all. We're reviewing this game, not the other one.

Pros 

- Quick battles allow for casual play.
- Very low-end requirements, you can play it on your granny's PC.
- True cross-platform multiplayer (console, mobile, PC).
- Bearable grind (I got to Tier VI with 20 hours played).
- Decent mechanics.
- A nice variety of tanks (more to come) which counter one another.
- Very easy to play with a friend (two is not possible yet)
- Free to play.

Cons 
- Some pay2win elements. 
- Russian tanks are a bit too powerful at first, can feel quite frustrating. 
- No achievements yet (I know people like those)

I want to clarify the pay2win elements a bit. 
It's not impossible to fight premium tanks, but they have advantages that most of the tanks of their tier don't. It can leave a bad taste if you're quite new at the game and you're still learning how to counter everything ( hint  you never do). Some players take that as a challenge (the uneven playing field), some dislike it. Your call.
Apart from the tanks, there are also premium shells (rounds). They are quite powerful, as they lack niether the penetration of HEAT shells, nor the damage of standard shells. However they are incredibly costly, and the ones using those are few are far between.

Hope you give it a go, the ratings are so incredibly unfair. It's a decent game.

7.5/10"
15747,"I'm an unicum, nearly a super unicum on my smurf account with 7k games. Together with my other account, I have 13k games played. This is a fun, slow-paced game and I like it. When compared to the PC version of the game, I think that it is much less confusing without being selective about crew skills, crew members, etc that will allow you to have a competitive advantage over your opponents. When I went to play the PC version, I had too many crew members and I didn't know what to do with them. I ended up spending my gold on buying extra slots and I still had to dismiss some of my crew members. I still don't know if that is the right choice or not or if there is a better way to spend my gold on. Anyways, that really confused me and I don't wish to go back to the PC version again."
15748,"NICE GAME
"
15749,Garbage
15750,its k.
15751,"Played this on Xbox before, so glad I found it on Steam"
15752,"it is fun but at the low teirs everything will pen your armor but it is not a bad thing, somthing i hate is wargaming says ""to use the most of your, armor angle it"" but the ytell us to make a 90 degree slope  to the enamy gun it tells us nothing on what to do when you have 2 or more guns foruced on you."
15753,Very enjoyable fun game to play.
15754,I really recommend this for the fans of WoT !
15755,Not enough filthy casuals playing this game
15756,"Have you ever wondered what a game would be like if the Developers gave 0 fllying fucks about balance?
LOOK NO FURTHER.
Shit ton of premium bonuses such as x2 XP, Credits, Overpowered items, Physics defying guns.

Do NOT play this game or the original if you don't plan on spending at least 300$ on it.
It's literally unplayable after the first week. Trust me, your hair WILL fall off, it's unavoidable if you download this crap.

There's not much else i can say. I'm 100% honest when i say that this is the most stressful, rage inducing, poorly developed game i have ever played in my 15 years of gaming. You can quote me on that.

Update: game is 1% less shit. Added RNG loot crates. Also added more premium 1hit guns."
15757,Cible détruite!
15758,i like the game becouse it is easier to use and play 20x more then world of tanks the original version was some kind of a mess
15759,its a good game

Amazing. Perfect.

Better than console and better than handheld by 1000%.

15764,destroyed alot
15765,If you played the mobile version all your account info is the same so no progress lost.  If you've never played then just get the regular WoT. It's way better.

15770,Great physics and in-game mechanics.
15771,"Was fun for a while, but then I remembered why I stopped playing the original World of Tanks: far, far too much grinding after tier III/IV, and success is pretty much entirely dependent on team mates (Yay, we won - most of the enemy team camped in the open / Crap, we lost, most of our team camped out in the open)."
15772,Trading card need
15773,"1. no same tier matchmaking ( usually getting up busted with higher tier enemy )
2. unfair terrain at start or base location
3. noob teammates
4. afk teammates
5. there is no action from developer to ban or kick those game ruiner player
6. its useless to buy anything if the devs arent watching the player. how can i interested to buy a bundle or anything if when i play, i just getting busted again and again, and the teammates are noob and afk. 6 teammates or more, and 3 -4 of them afk."
15774,I`ve been playing this since it was available only on iOS. And i can say that i still really enjoy it.
15775,Yeee Tank

15796,"A good enough port from Mobile.

If you want to enjoy World of Tanks without mods, this game is for you.
It may not have the same graphics, the same animations, the same tank trees but it is good enough.

Comparing this game to the original WoT, tanks perform different, they don't have the same characteristics.
Some may be buffed while others nerfed."
15797,best tank game in steam !
15798,"I already played this game from my smartphone so:

Pros:
- Ported from smartphones.
- Can now experience World of Tanks Blitz using your potato PC and windows tablet PC's/PC Sticks (like compute stick)
- You can bind with your existing Wargaming account
- You can now use keyboard and mouse as your controls and most keybinds from base/original game are available.
- Good and reasonable deals compare to base game aside from the optional loot boxes thing (or gacha on web game players).
- Accuracy is reasonable compare to base game even without RNG(sus) on your side.
- No Arty.

Cons:
- 3D Physics. Well physics on this game are still based on old versions of base game so i don't mind.
- Graphics - Not great compare to base game but still fine.
- If RNG still hates you
- NO ARTY!

I would say I'll only recommend this game for players who are using smartphones which saves the durability of the battery. Other than that just play original game."
15799,yes
15800,"Many people compares this to World of Tanks, but i would say it is a different thing

First, I am a player of this game in the android version.
Second, i do really happy when i can play WoTB in my own PC

Why different? because not everyone can play the original WoT in their PC (it would be the system requirements or the game sizes)
Of course if we comparing the Blitz with the Original, that would be far away in every aspects.

I would say the Steam version was made for the player who wants to move from Android version because several issues (battery draining, graphical issues, etc) or for the player who wants to try WoT in a smaller size and lower system requirements.

And yes, Cross Platform gameplay in Blitz. Now i can play this game in my PC with my Android - iOS Blitz teammates.

So i recommend this game to everyone who wants to feel the cross platform with mobile user friends"
15801,"This game is not worth a penny to put into! This game is full of hackers and cheaters and is not any sort of fun at all. If you want a real game that is far better then this and that is fun, play Arma 3. Arma has way better graphics, bigger maps, more people can play and alot more. OH! And um... you can actually get out of the tank as well on arma. But can you do that here? Nope. So... Arma 3, Plus! World of Tanks, minus. Please don't make the mistake of getting this and spending alllll of your money for a horrible game."
15802,"Very fun, but feels like a mobile game... which it is, but seems a bit more fun than normal WoT I'm not sure why. 

I hope they add more players in one match."
15803,WoT on steam and it keeps the annoying artillery out
15804,"great simulation , real action on one of several tanks!!"
15805,its fun to shoot other tanks
15806,Not bad
15807,"Fast paced, fun tank game it sure isnt PC WOT but who cares it is its own thing enjoy it for that!"
15808,this game is amazing but if you play at night you will get rekted like a noob
15809,"Best Game ever, but with half the tanks in battles :C. Seriously tho"
15810,Разочаровался
15811,"If you are a new player, Blitz offers few advantages over the non-mobile/non-steam version. If you are an old player, you'll be kissing all your progress goodbye and re-grinding tanks for a more limited selection.

+ Tutorial system is more inviting
+ 7v7 matches means theres more agency and control over a game
+ Different crew system were all perks are shared means less of a grind, and less variation between player progress.
+/- 'Rebalanced' Tiers, feels like you are more likely to be playing in the Top Tier of a game but Scout Tanks have not been rebalanced.
+ New sfx and new maps make for some welcomed novelty.
+ No premium consumables
+ Reduced modules at least at low tier, less of a grind, don't have to worry about tracks and radios for a while. But can mean less options for weight and builds.
+/- Cross platform play makes for additional seal clubbing action
+/- Said seal clubbing usually means mobile and some new players will drop out before they reach higher tiers. At which point its seasoned players re-grinding a simplified version of the desktop game.
+/- Just as a grindfest as normal World of Tanks
+/- Multiuse consumables in match

-No consumable/module management. AKA SUPER CREDIT TAX. You sell all ammo every time you mount a turret or change a gun. Consumables are either On or Sold.
-No Artillery Class Vehicles, means less options in dealing with certain heavies and tank destroyers
-No French or Chinese Trees (yet)
-Missing many non-SPG vehicles available in World of Tanks such as high Tier American Autoloaders like the T69
-Ping Spikes on PC
-Account is locked to server, progress is locked to server, so all the money and time you put in does not carry over from servers or World of Tanks.
"
15812,"As a WoT PC player this game is great when I want to have the tanking experience with no effort required. 10/10.

This was my review until I quit four years ago due to them screwing up their old equipment system.

I re-downloaded and resumed playing just two months ago. Guess what? As of the day of this review, they just screwed up the ENTIRE economy of their game.

Without paying for ""premium time"" it's impossible to run full loadouts and make any profit. Even with premium time, profiting is near impossible if you use optimal loadouts."
15813,"Don't let the fact fool you that this is only a ""mobile"" port and has in-game currency, which can be bought with real money. It wont really give you an edge anyway. There is still lots of depth in this game and lot of fun to be had. Can I get my badge now?"
15814,Best f2p game
15815,good
15816,Hate it or love it ?
15817,"Best game ever :D
This is a very good money maker I wish to be the first who made this game hahaha! !
A PLUS"
15818,Fun and addicting!Many bugs and glitches though.
15819,I've got a shitty pc so I couldn't play PC version of the game no matter how eager I was. So I'm happy this one has been relesaed on PC. Thanks potatoes
15820,"Картоша харош, молодец, танки в стим отличная идея.
"
15821,"not as good as the standard WOT but still the aiming system is dumb 
"
15822,"THIS GAME REALLY NEEDS MAINTENAINCE IN SO MANY WAYS. 
LAGGY
LOW RES= LITERALLY MINECRAFT TANKS
CONNECTION VIA WIRELESS= LAST PLAYER TO LOAD INGAME

ITS BETTER TO PLAY ON PHONE NOT COM WHY THE HELL DID I DOWNLOAD DIS THERES WORLD OF TANKS COMPUTER

KYS BLITZ"
15823,Not as good as regular WoT or other series. Feels like that Doom 3: BFG edition I bought which is a watered down version of the game. Do not bother with this also some tanks randomly appear infront of you showing this game has glitches.
15824,"World of tanks blitz is what it says it is in the can, its a world war 2 themed 7 vs 7 tank battle ground game, you maybe its like the the already on pc world of tanks, because it is this is a port of the mobile verison of world of tanks, now the game its self, it has 5 tech trees which are the german tank tree, the united states,great britian and russian all with heavy, light, medium and tank destoryer tanks, i left out japan because they have a handful of tanks a few lights and the rest medium tanks all the way to tier 10 no heavy tanks no tank destoryers, now the gameplay for pc atleast the same for world of tanks standard, easy to understand and all controls i could bind to different keys, progression is slow if your not very good which ill admit im not good at this game ive only got to tier 5 because ive played it on my tablet, now what i actually think of the game its beer its the beer of games, its watered down to the point where there is no taste left and you just got the compants of world of tanks, which unlike beer i dont mind i like this game for what it is on tablet and on my laptop because i can run it on my laptop because my desktops motherboard is dead, anyway its a good game its not bad its just world of tanks for the lower end of computers but for high computer get the original world of tanks game not this."
15825,iT OK
15826,World of Tanks Blitz is a very well developed game that is grindy but posts a good reward and the grind can be enjoyable to any player
15827,good game
15828,"It's fun to kill players from mobile phones and xbox, they are pretty much helpless. Good stress-relief after playing normal version :D"
15829,"If you play the original World of Tanks, this version might not be for you.  In short the differences are NO ARTY (which hell yea), no overpriced bundles, and they come up with creative fun tanks.  This is a nice thing to play if you want to play tanks but win since you can totally tell who is using a tablet.  I reccomend this to all who are curious.  This is a nice intro step into the World of Tanks experience.  Then you can go to the website and download the real game to see what they offer."
15830,Why on EARTH would you ever play this over the actual World of Tanks!?
15831,"Lol kill your selves seriously fuck you.Remove this ""free"" trash from steam."
15832,So many things missing in this if you want to play WOT get the original version or get the gaming consoles dont waste your time on this
15833,"Played this, thought it was some new twist to the franchise, realized it's the mobile version of World Of Tanks. 
It's fun, no issues there but.....

Play World of Tanks instead, it's much better."
15834,Good game
15835,"It's not that bad.
I was actually thinking of downloading WarThunder or WoT PC lately but it's way too large because I live somewhere in asia where internet is fucking expensive, slow, and bandwidth-capped.
Then this came. It's quick to download, just around 3GB. And the matches are fast.
So I can try it out and drop it without regrets.
Though I think I like it so far."
15836,Simply made
15837,This game is the same as War Thunder. I recommend you guys to play War Thunder. The map is too small and will be quite boring after a while. War Thunder has bigger maps and even include aircaft.
15838,"Initially fun, then it get tedious....when money buys victory it reaks."
15839,"Although I can't stand by what Wargaming was doing with threatening copyright strikes and all I can say this because I have played enough of their games on all of the platforms availible. Skill and knowing the game mechanics will still out do anyone who went and paid for a premium tank.

For all of the reviews saying the game is pay to win well thats just a blatant lie. You can get through the game fine without paying but you can choose to pay to progress faster in the form of a couple of premium tanks for earnings and maybe even a premium account.

If you don't want to spend the money then don't spend the money its as simple as that. I personally wont be buying anything else from WG untill they get their stuff sorted and clean up the mess they made by having very poor communication not only through the branches of the company but to the players of their games as well."
15840,It suck so much
15841,"Fun game! 
If your PC/laptop cant run normal Wot than you should get this, but if it can, just stick with the normal WoT"
15842,Guess WG wanted something that sucks harder then WoT
15843,"Just get  the PC/console versions of WOT, they are superior in almost every way."
15844,"Its a alright game, no clue when that reveiw saying I didn't like it came from. Its stayed relativly the same. It gets a solid 7/10 for me. The game could be better."
15845,"Its a good gane for Steam users them must play on window
"
15846,not bad game :)
15847,Good enough for me
15848,"Try it, dont spend any money on it and if you like it then get the full version and enjoy a far better version."
15849,"I hate playing this game on tablet, but now on PC its simply amazing. Its much faster than full version and more action packed. 7v7 system will allow you to be hero;)"
15850,"well first of all, I really like the game but there are a few things i don't like #1 being that im running windows 7 home 

premium and I got to play it when it was beta weekend and now it just doesn't work. For example I click play and it says  

running then it says syncing then it doesn't work does anyone have advice to this ???

But the tanks are pretty good in detail but for example the T-82, you can see inside the tank and there 

are no people in the tank. What is it a ghost tank

"
15851,"No reason to have this on PC. Play the original WoT, it is also free and is better in every way. And the graphics settings in WoT do go down. If your PC can play this, it can play WoT on low just fine."
15852,This game is too boring and I need to pay to be competetive in further (higher tier) battles.
15853,"With how shitty the normal World of Tanks has become, World of Tanks Blitz is now a better choice to play.

I would give the game a 7/10, While graphics are somewhat bad but the perfomance is pretty good, has a lot of tanks to play but sadly it does have some p2w elements."
15854,"Fun game once you get the hang of it.  Lots of grinding away until you can get a really useful vehicle, but thankfully the came scales engagements so you won't be hopelessly outclassed.
Lots of tactics to learn in order to survive, but even a defeat can be enjoyable!  You get a bonus is you are last man standing on your side when time runs out.  Rarely get that, myself, because I'd rather engage than hide."
15855,Anyone who says this game is P2W is just a mad noob.
15856,very good cool game A+
15857,"I see the reviews for this game show mixed opinions and I might as well give my own plus some information about it.

This version of World of Tanks was originally a mobile phone exclusive. Since the average mobile phone has way less powerful hardware than an average PC, the requirements to play this game are significantly lower. In comparison to its PC equivilant, this version of course has less graphics, smaller match sizes (14 players vs 30 on regular WoT), and a more visualized interface (big buttons and other stuff).

As Wargaming makes an attempt to create a cross-platform version of WoT, Blitz was introduced on the Windows 10 App store and now Steam. I am happy that this game is now on Steam since you no longer need a phone or a PC with Windows 10 to play this game. Not that I don't have Windows 10.

Besides toned down features from WoT, the map sizes are smaller and there are no indirect fire SPGs. There are less tech trees and they are smaller but the damage models are revised and you can see where your shells can and can't penetrate. Other than that, in summary, this is a more simplified version of WoT.

Now for my opinion of this game, considering I've been playing this game for months with over 1000 battles of experience, I actually like this game better than the original WoT. Now don't get me wrong, World of Tanks is a great game, but I don't think it appeals to my taste. I've played the original WoT for about dozens to a hundred or so hours just to give you how much experience and to be honest, the matches I've spent in that game are pretty sporadic. There's just so much going on that you have little control over the entire match and you can struggle as a result. Yet, maybe if I decide to play that game again and try my best, I may get a different experience.

But for now, World of Tanks Blitz appeals to my taste. It isn't the only tank game I play as I also play War Thunder which I have over 1000 hours of playtime in planes and tanks. If your wanting to try something new, whether you've played regular World of Tanks before or not, give this one a try. This game is free to play so you don't have to pay for anything whether you happen to like it or not. Also if you ever want to find me, my WoTB tag is ""ArmoredMustelid"" (this is my third wargaming account that I started with WoTB)"
15858,A tank is a tank.....
15859,"Gave it a try, and sadly its the same old bad ""world of tanks"" game. The only good thing about it is the fun killing artillary is removed. Beyond that, its the same unbalanced bad match making game its always been. Battles are just a mish mash of every sort of tank, from every nation and era, and of differing tiers, that create battles that are often so unbalanced that there is no battle. One group of tanks simply gets to take out the other group, and all the victims can do is try to run or scratch their killers paint with a couple shots. Not fun for any player actually looking for good gameplay. 

Why WoT thinks this is a good gameplay model is beyond me. This game has so much more potential if WoT would put some effort into balancing their match making system. Like putting nations together into teams, and put tanks together of the same time period and crew skill level. And no multi-tier'ed matches. The game seems like it was being built to be like that, but the devs quit and put this out instead."
15860,Game just keeps on crashing . So don't bother with it .
15861,"Personally I do not understand all of the downvotes! I think some people missunderstand the purpose of this game on Steam! This game is made by the same company for mobile devices (90%+ of the playerbase is on mobile, they are not looking to move to PC just give that optiion to players), as people like myself, often do not have time to play games that require a lot of time and commitment at home and that I only have time during travel. However when I am at home I would prefer to play on my PC. Firstly  I would say don't get this game if you want the PC version as your main World of Tanks game, although WoTB is an incredibly fun game which I give my full recommendation for if you can get around the fact that it IS a mobile game. Hope this clears up some things.

Thanks for reading"
15862,Add PC controller support and you will get my upvote.
15863,Port has gotten better
15864,This is a World War  game is a tank game I really like this game I hope you all play together lel
15865,Ive played it for a week or 2 and now the game is just saying running then starts syncing then dosent start i like game but this needs to be fixed im on windows 7
15866,"Good game, but $50 for 2000 gold??"
15867,I think this is a great game and its pretty much World of Tanks I recommend it to anyone who likes World of Tanks.
15868,"This is basically a mini world of tanks game with 7v7, i havent found any reasons to hate this game yet.
World of tanks is better in almost every way compared to blitz, the only good point in blitz that is better than the original is that it has low requirements, wich can deeply help on inviting friends to play, being less than 2 GBs is kinda good in certain ways, installs/reinstalls fast.
After the first 3 tiers it gets better.

I find it disapointing that in the negative reviews, wich basicaly only state that this game is bad because the original is better in almost everyway, it feels like they come from the usual gamers that only care about graphics. 

For the veterans that say that this version is P2W, i gess they havent played the original.

Oh, i love how none of these ""brilliant"" veterans didnt mention that there isnt any arty on this version, last time i checked, that was the main topic of hate on the original game.
 
Love the free available cammo.

Yesterday i managed to get my german tank on top of an enemy matilda (temple map), because if i cant penetrate that fat girl, ill ride her, a funny moment indeed it was. 


Overrall this game is not a bad game.














"
15869,"If you're playing on a toaster, i'll suggest this game, if have a half decent pc, get the actual thing. This game is rather tiny and doesn't require much of a pc or internet to run and it got rather short rounds, rounds vary from like 2-4min, so if you're just looking for something fun to play every now and then and your pc is trash, then i'd recommend this. But if you actually can run games and you want the optimal experience, get the orginal World of Tanks. It's way better in every way, but well, as they say, clothes after weather."
15870,"Although a bit brief in gameplay, and hard to read the chat scroll, the game itself is fun and plays very well even on low-powered hardware.  There is nothing really negative to be said about the game.  Its well made, walks you through a good tutorial on how to play and upgrade your vehicle, and like many good online games: it promotes teamplay to win."
15871,"I think this game is not as bad as other people are saying. Yes it is a mobile port on first sight (big buttons, mobile like options menu). BUT!! is this game bad or worse than World of Tanks (original)????? NO, I must say NO. And here is reason why.. 
*There are many things that World of Tanks Blitz is doing better. For example : 
Friendly fire off (so no idiots can kill you, because ''they-he don´t like you'')
Friendly colision is off (if your friend or just another player RAM you,you will not get damage)
You don´t have to buy modifications for tank (like turrets,cannons,better engine).
There are no artillery tanks in the game. (I think it makes WOTB better in my oppinion).
When you get on tier 3 MM can put you into match on A LOT, A LOT BETTER AND BIGGER MAPS WHERE YOU CAN USE BOTH STRATEGY AND ENVIROMENT.

*MAP DESIGN: before tier 3 I was putting on not so well looking maps or interesting,but after tier 3 maps get bigger and a lot fun,interesting places and UNIQUE maps.

*BAD THINGS/DISOPOINTMENT
Graphics: I must say this: I played WOT =WOT is a lot better looking , hovever my PC IS SHIT SOO... I CANT PLAY WOT ANYMORE Soo.. yes you get it graphics arent great hovever it is more good for bad PCs. (2005-2007 graphics)

PS:Excuse me if there are mistakes or errors in the text"
15872,i have a serious promblem with my profile please some have to help me:(:(
15873,Liked it so far
15874,"First, i want to say that like many reviews before me, i also have played World of Tanks PC for several years, and also have played WoT blitz in my mobile for a short time before i uninstalled it because my mobile is even worse than my PC (not to mention third-world country mobile connection...).

When WoT: Blitz available on Steam, i am intrigued. I think 'hey, maybe its a nice side game to unwind after losing so many times in PC version'. So i installed it and played it again.

Hoo boy, how Wargaming always find a way to annoys its player.

Soon after installing i am automatically logged in with my Steam account, not given much chance to switch to my Wargaming account and forced to play tutorials, and forced again to play two mandatory random matches. IDK if i missed something, but i only managed to switch my account after finishing mandatory tutorials.

The game itself.... well, graphic aside, its lite version of WoT. Nothing really new for PC WoT players. No Arty is a plus, match is faster, some gameplay mechanics are really simplified. In comparison, WoT PC version offer better graphic, more in-depth gameplay, more tanks, more nations, in price of inclusion of Artillery class (which you will learn to loathe).

My Verdict?
Old WoT players might want to skip this, or just play it on mobile/tablet, no point playing this on PC really. No artillery is the only plus side for WoT:Blitz for PC (and occasional promo vehicles).
New player... well, why not. Its not resource hungry, its relatively simple, graphic is actually okay-ish, and i think it better to get used with Blitz first before playing original WoT."
15875,Nice Game !
15876,"Very good game like WoT, but this one is faster and take less time from you... Of course there is one problem..             Mobile players :D"
15877,"This game, after a long time, is pretty much just for fun now. 

Originally, I loved it a lot for being a quicker burst-action version of World of Tanks but I came to dislike it for a longer period of time.

Now it's just something I drop money into when I do not want to play War Thunder after 9,000 hours."
15878,"I didn't expect much from mobile version of really enjoyable game but to be honest, I never thought it will be this bad. And I don't mean graphics and stuff here. 7vs7 battles doesn't feel really exciting, maps are way too small to enjoy even 10% of original PC version of World of Tanks. Almost every battle doesn't even last 2-3 minutes and it's not only low tier thing. Also, having no arty isn't a good thing but I know, it would be too hard to pull on mobile game. There is no trace of tactics left.

I really wanted to play it for much longer but sadly I won't. I don't really understand the reason why mobile port makes it on Steam, not the normal version. Too scared of War Thunder? Having some kind of competition is always great but World of Tanks Blitz will probably make only people stay away from Wargaming games."
15879,Worst game ever. i used 250 gold for more resources and Went to 100 wars to get 50k money and. Wasted 20 hours . Then? lost 60k by one war. Good game such a good game
15880,fun little game
15881,Great and lighter version of WoT on PC
15882,シンクタンクバトルです！！！
15883,WOT but for kids.
15884,"I have hundreds of hours into the orignal game and was confused when I first saw this. First I thought, "" Why is a phone game on here? "" and "" Is it only between PC players or will Phone players be included?"" Yes this is a port directly from the moblie game and yes you do play aginest people on said phones. Its very unfair in that respect as PC players are at a extreme advatage. That held up very true. Most battles I could just rush behind or besides enemys and they would die quicly and be confused.  This game should have stayed on iOS and Android and not for PC. It works good there and should have never left.  Wargaming, like most other companies, is just here for cash grap and not listening to anyone in the community. People thought they would make World of Tanks be accessable from Steam but all they did is rerelease a mobile port that really sucks. It dosen't even run right after playing it for less then 3 hours, it crashes after startup everytime. If you see this please just go and download the original game and ignore this. The original World of Tanks is alot bigger, alot more graphicly pleasing and alot more PC optimized."

15887,Nice game!
15888,"The usual reason to play WoT Blitz is to speed up waiting - be it on the Porcelain Throne, on a bus or in a queue. Now I can add 'just for the heck of it (without using BlueStacks)' to my list.

After 826 battles, I've unlocked:
Chi-Nu, Japanese Tier 5 medium tank,
AT-2, British Tier 5 tank destroyer,
SU-85, Soviet Tier 5 tank destroyer,
KV-1S, Soviet Tier 6 heavy tank,
Leopard, German Tier 5 light tank.

I was initially very impressed by others bouncing dozens of shots off the armor of the KV-1 and decided I must also have it. The Soviet heavy tree has been a boring grind for the most part though with the only exception of the T-46 (tier 3). The KVs are very slow and virtually blind. It's a lottery if you'll manage to position yourself for a few hard-hitting shots and absorbing a good amount of damage or you'll get raped from behind by a Leopard within the first 2 minutes. The KV-1S was incredibly weak until I got the best gun for it (costing 20k experience), but even now it reloads so slow that a single miss can mean I'm more of a burden than a boon to my team.

The British AT-2 is the closest you get to cheating in this game. In a battle where you're the highest tier and you manage to keep enemies off your ass and shooting at your front you'll quickly ruin the other team's game. It has 203 mm of frontal armor, which would be good at tier 7 (you're tier 5). You're going to sacrifice speed (it's really-really slow) and view range, so you kind of still depend on your team to scout baddies out for you, but this is probably the easiest tank to steal the show with by shrugging off thousands of points of damage and destroying most of the enemy team.

The Soviet TD line has been pretty much okay all-around. SU-85 has a nice low profile for hiding behind rocks and hopefully making the enemy aim a bit too high and miss.

German light tanks require skill. A masterful Leopard can punch much higher than it's weight, but it's also really easy to speed into a group of enemies and get killed within 30 seconds of the start of the battle. It's an okay tree to unlock, but nothing that exhilirating. German TDs are quite enjoyable, especially the Hetzer with it's small frame and very well angled armor plates for bouncing off shots even if you do get spotted.

Surprisingly the Japanese tech line has been by far the most fun for me. I chose the light branch (Ha-Go, Ke-Ni, Ke-Ho) winning 62, 61 and 50 % of the battles respectively, being 'productive' in each battle. The tier 5 Chi-Nu is on the useless side starting out but also quite good when fully upgraded. What made the light Japanese tanks so fun was that I could reach any mountaintop, their small size (all stats being equal, a smaller tank is better) made almost any bush viable for total camoflague and guns with high maximum depression angles and fast reload times enabled me to keep shooting almost every second of the battle. Shooting opponents is the fun part of WoT Blitz and the Jap tanks offered lots and lots of this.

I think it generally holds true that the higher level you play at, the more boring it gets. At Tier 6+ everyone's pretty much a veteran, knows all the sweet spots on the map and punishes any mistake you make harshly. Battles where you can kill 3-6 tanks on the enemy team via sniping cleverly are pretty much behind you by then. So I think it's fair to recommend playing multiple low level tanks instead of focusing hard on one.

Why I generally like WoT Blitz:
1) Best time killer app I know - kills lots of it without getting boring, difficult or whatever, effectively a time machine when waiting at the dentist's for example
2) Very short match queues - I don't want to queue while I queue
3) Progressing through tiers of tanks feels good
4) At least for now, no-one cheats, almost no-one pays to win
5) I get to learn tank names
6) A lot less of a cl*sterf*ck than the original WoT for desktop

15889,"Extremely addictive and loads of fun.
But - Premium prices are insane. This has to be the most expensive game online."
15890,Cool
15891,"this resembles the wargaming games much more than the normal PC port of WoT which is slow along with basicaly any other PC wargaming game, this game has good graphics, very good fps and good content, which is why i like it"
15892,this one sucks bad
15893,not realistic
15894,"Отличная игра.Рад выходу ее в стим.Рекомендую!
"
15895,"Its a realy good game but it wil be fun if it was 15 vs 15 just like the real game.
The gameplay is good and its free so download the game its fun. (And you can play whit your friends)"
15896,"I can see where all the hate for this game is coming from.
But if you ever wanted to play world of tanks and your pc is absolute garbage, get this game, sure its less realistic but its alot more fast paced. Its sure a game to try out."
15897,"Gameplay is solid.

Having to buy ammunition for your tank everytime you upgrade your main turret is bad game design. You make enough cash where it really doesn't make sense to buy ammo.

If you don't buy ammo you literally can end up, in a live match with no ammo. You end up being dead weight because of bad game design. You can even buy a new turret, nothing changes with your gun, and you still need to buy ammo.

A small issue, but ends up literally frustrating the living hell out of me. A player shouldn't have to suffer a loss due to your poor design.

Change it so that basic ammunition is unlimited, and special ammunition is purchasable and the problems solved.

Game is absolute garbage, if it weren't for the decent gameplay.

Wargaming Group Limited probably won't fix anything given that there are people who will adapt to their flawed system, so yeah if you're casual games great, otherwise don't do it man.

2/10 - Sprinkle covered human waste, but if you don't mind that it's alright.

TL:DR
Pros:
Gameplays good
Controls alright
Free

Cons:
Useless ammo system
Steep learning curve
Generally less than helpful teammates"
15898,"Great example of why Wargaming is a greedy stagnated company. They won't bring ""normal"" PC version of World of Tanks to Steam so they won't have to share revenue. But it's OK to dump this piece-of-trash mobile port in the heart of a mostly PC-hardcore platform. Guess this shovelware doesn't make enough money even on smartphones, which alone can tell you alot about it's overall quality."
15899,"Played the tutorial and it looks shit, and then I try my username and it says its already taken,  on the real game you get a good selection of names that no one has taken.."
15900,"This is a fun game. Can be a little unbalanced at times, and sometimes you get stuck with a derp team. But it is fast paced, within only a day of game time I've already reached the point where you actually have to grind a little to earn the next tier tank. I think this game has alot of potential.


Edit: After a few Days of ""Grinding"" I think its only fair to update my review.

First off, the teams are rarely useful, Tier IV tanks are also rarely useful. I cant tell you how many matches I've played where everyone just up and leaves you to fend for yourself, which only dooms your team. And dont even get me started on the HUGE gap between Tier IV and Tier V tanks. at leas in Tier I - IV you can damage the enemy, I've played the German, Japanese, and American Skill tree (working on the Russians now) and I can tell you Tier V's are way too over Armored, even using Premium Ammo I only damage them maybe 1 out of ever 6 shots. and its never enough to actually contribute.

Grinding in this game to get from Tier IV to Tier V means you join as many battles as you can and Watch your win ration slowly go down. Earning a mear 150 to 200 xp per match until you have the staggering 15k xp it takes to research a Tier V.... 

With all that said, Tier I - III is super fun and usually fairly balanced. I still see potential in this game."
15901,"I don't really like the fantasy tanks, but other then that, tank goes pew! pew! I like it.  9/10"
15902,Why would you play this garbage if you can play the real world of tanks? Gold in this game is not even shared with the real game. Money grab confirmed.
15903,"http://worldoftanks.com
Go here to get the legit pc version, also free to play.
Unless you have a bad pc then play this"
15904,"This game is great for those who are looking for something they can pick up in just a few minutes and drop when they have something to do. 

9/10

"
15905,"I like it...Simple easy to play...and I think of it as training for the full version of World of Tanks.
"
15906,I couldnt get past the tutorial. I have played world of tanks for years and you are seriously going to force me to buy the teir 2 american medium tank instead of the fucking AT. blow it out ur ass
15907,"I LOVE World of Warships, and WoT is pretty good as well. I can understand wanting to scale back the graphics a bit to reudce file sizes and can overlook the low resolutions. (Let's be honest, having to download a 10GB update isn't exactly fun.) But WoT Blitz is very dumbed down. It holds your hand WAY too much. I don't like that."
15908,"Why this? Why mobile game on Steam? I remember playing original World of Tanks couple of years ago.
I grinded so fucking hard to get better tier tank. Matches took so long and you were getting so little experience and credits. I finally managed to get to tier 5! American M4 Sherman IIRC... only to realize how much that tank sucked. And then I saw how much more grinding was before me in a bad tank to get anything better.
Thanks, but NO! WoT is awful!

Then I played the mobile version on my phone and had many more tanks in shorter time, also grabbed free tank slots on promos, so I'm not that limited. 
This game looks rather bad, is dumbed down, but it's at least a bit more REASONABLE in GRINDING FEST.

It could be better, but it's still fun, especially that you can play on mobile and have same account. 
Game still requires a LOT of grinding though."
15909,very fun controls and strategy elemnt as you work with strangers to take onthe same enemy
15910,Really good game!
15911,its a very simple very fun multiplayer game.best part is that each game lasts for 4-6 mins.comparing the full fledged world of tanks to WOT blitz is like comparing a watermelon to a cherry.you can enjoy em both according to your need
15912,"Not so bad at all,perfectly good for a minimized game from the original WOT"
15913,fun
15914,"Perfect WOT. Much better than big brother. This should be a WOT, not such as it now."
15915,Cool Game
15916,nice game
15917,WG should bring some gud shit from this to PC version pls...
15918,"Why anyone thought that porting this MOBILE game to PC, when there is an actual non watered down version of this very same game, was a great idea is beyond me... What's even more surprising is that anyone would find this crap good or even acceptable as a PC game.

It never was too good on mobile after you played the actual PC equivalent and it never will be. Don't play this and don't spend cash on this F2P P2W cashgrab kiddy version. If anything this version of WoT will be perfect for your 4 year-old brother on a tablet to keep lemmings out of the PC MM.

I as a gamer and a WoT PC player feel insulted by this abomination and don't try to justify a crappy phone game port to PC. Crappy graphics a Nokia 3310 could produce, no physics, weird ported controls that make you feel your tank is skating on ice, poor watered down interface, a lot of missing features and tanks.

y tho? y Wargaming?

Go play the actual PC version!"
15919,"Я купил танк са сотку рублей и проиграл и не советую играть
"
15920,"DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i started playing and then after lie 1 week it just does not work"
15921,"It has crashed 8 times in the last 10 minutes or so, would love to play it, however until its fixed i see no point."
15922,i like it..
15923,"If you can't run World of Tanks on your PC, this is a good replacement, but of course never will be the same. But it never was suppost to be, it's a Mobile Game, and actually, one of the best mobile games. Even with microtransactions, i don't believe it's pay to win, and Wargaming always brings new content, which is nice.

[Update 2018]:
Update 5.5 has brought some controversy, since Wargaming has removed some tanks to simplify progressing, stating that they want to keep in newer players.
It's complicated, but we have to see how it evolves."
15924,"Do you like it up close and personal ? 
Do you like the sound of steel screaming and breaking under your repeated assults ?

World of Tanks Blitz is quite the same as its big brother but more nervous and fast paced due to smaller arenas and smaller teams.

Drive a tank and work (or rather try to) with your teammates to defeat the enemy team by anihilating it or capturing zones.
Individual skill has a meaningful impact as every teammate or enemy killed weighs quite a lot in the balance, and the lack of SPG in the game removes the biggest threat there was to the Heavy Tanks, making the assaults more brutal and relentless than ever.

Contrary to WoT PC, the feel you get at low tier is quite similar to the feel you get at higher tiers since you no longer have to cover a lot of ground to see the action and the lack of ""capture the enemy base goal"" means that your team no longer camps (at least not too much).
"
15925,honestly I dont like this game its very unrealestic but if you do I highly recommend Warthunder it is very fun and very real.
15926,"Uh... kind of surprised at the flak this game is getting. I've played the non-Blitz version before and it is a bit better with richer tank team progression and tech trees and such, more vehicle types too. But this is a free-to-play version that works with mobile interface, and I find that pretty exciting and well-executed. I get an almost identical immersion experience as the original version and it's not graphically- or gameplay-inferior. There are a few extra indicator arrows and things that would be absolutely necessary on a mobile device but don't detract from a PC experience, so I don't understand the whining. If the orginal version of the game was a first-class ticket, then Blitz is business-class as opposed to coach. The free-to-play and pay-to-gain elements aren't disruptive or exclusive, this is a well-put-together product for a wider audience of tank-battlers. No need for the high horse."
15927,"nice game
"
15928,playing against mobile users 10/10
15929,"Con:
Graphic: It hurt my eye! It is too bright and way much growy.
Gameplay: I can't say there is any differnt between the base game and this, and the base game has alot more stuff on it. Still need to grind as hell.
Sound: It doesn't even on 16bit 44100mhz, I am bleeding everytime when my tank climbing a hillside.
Network: Still LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggggggggggg

Pro: 
Well........Atleast it runs faster on my computer.
Well........The size of the game is smaller......"
15930,"История наша началась 14 ноября 2016 года, в 20:30 вечера. Решил зайти в стимчанский, чекнуть новиночки и может во что-то поиграть. Захожу в стим и вижу у себя в рекомендациях World of Tanks:Blitz. Я конечно же обрадовался (нет) и побежал со всех ног качать этот шедевр (нет). Скачал и был рад и доволен тем, что такую замечательную игру, выпустили в стиме (нет). А если честно, то это не игра, а редкостная параша, а почему именно параша, узнаете из пунктов ниже. 
--Движок. Движок старый и убогий. Из него вытекают четыре следующих минуса.
--Графика. Графика, она непросто некрасивая, она ужасная. Пиксели, мыло, дальность прорисовки-всё это выглядит ужасно.
--Физика. Реализм? Хммм... Реализм, реализм в WOT... Ах да, точно, его нет. Физика до ужаса аркадная. Танки так себя не вели в реальной жизни (даже в Быдлофилде реализма побольше будет). И ладно, этого пункта не было бы, если бы не петухи, которые кукарекают, мол-""У нас реализм, ко-ко, танки ведут себя, как настоящие, к-ко-ко, танки рулят, ко-ко-ко."" 
--Баги. Багов столько, что Быдлофилд со своими лошадьми, которых можно чинить, отдыхает.
--Оптимизация. Оптимизация находится на таком низком уровне, что кажется, что игра находится на Пре-пре-пре-пре-over дохера пре-ранней версии. 
--Геймплей. Геймплей скучен и примитивен. Начинаешь качать ветку, купил первый танк, исследовал модули, накопил опыт и кредиты, перешёл на новый танк. Купил танк, исследовал модули, накопил опыт и кредиты, перешёл на новый танк. Танк, модули, опыт, кредиты, танк. И так далее. Скучно и неинтересно.
--Комьюнити. Охохох, мы таки дошли до этого пункта. Знаете, даже в СиЭс:Джо и Дутке, не такое хуё_вое комьюнити, как в Вурлд оф Тунксах. Маленькие школьники, 40 летние ""старики"", куча бомбящей ваты. Тут люди, либо слишком хорошо играют, либо тупят, словно они играют и одновременно их в зад долбит отчим (и эти ракалы будут винить тебя в сливах и каких-либо  неправильных поступках). Танкист-хуже пидо_раса.
--Донат. Вот тут WGеи постарались. В систему доната они вложили всю свою душу и любовь к игрокам (нет). Эта ""игра"" сплошной донат. Выкачивают деньги откуда только можно. Снаряды, скины (камуфляжи, кому как удобно), танки, голда, кредиты, свободный опыт-всё это приобретается за деньги. Платить никто не заставляет, но тогда вы будете насасывать у батек нагибаторов228 и тащеров всея танки.
--Белорусский рандом. Это просто пз_дц. Просто скажу... тимма, состоящая из ЛТ и СТ 7-8 уровня, против тиммы с тяжеми и ПТ 7-8. Спасибо, до свидания
Итог: World Of Tanks-это не игра, это очередной вы__сер от Раша (окей, Белораша) разработчиков, гордо распиаренный в Зомбо Ящике, у блоггеров и на различных сайтах. У игры нет плюсов, поэтому и оценка соответствующая 0 плюсов/10."
15931,i hope you'r update SPG for this game
15932,"-no arty 
-no 8,8 cm flak truck

-10/10 would arty again"
15933," - Real-life physics to create authentic tank movement and damage mechanics

Where can i find these ""Real-life physics and damage mechanics""?
""Real-life"">> changing tire... +- 4-5 mins... here? tracks repaired instantly... driver injured... healed instantly... ""Magic?""

15934,why would you play this when there is world of tanks.
15935,"fun game to play, it is not as high quality as the (non-steam) original version, this is the mobile version of world of tanks. in my opinion the best part about it is that you can play in multiplayer with android / ios devices on pc."
15936,"This is a great game for them computers that cant handle high end game :D
many different tank trees for you to choose from 
They have made a good job on this game :D"
15937,"Очень рад что ее смогли портануть под windows, слава Богу в игре нет арты, достаточно быстрые бои, симпотичный графон, как по мне удобное управление, страно что тут много не хороших отзывов, про эту игру. 
Рекомендую лично опробывать ее, так как каждому свое, на вкус и цвет)"
15938,Better graphics than its predecessor. I like the idea of 7v7 more but I would like to have all the tanks that the other version has.
15939,As Far as Games go this game is not bad. It runs very easily on my pc and can be fun. It's easy to learn and multiplayer works well. If you want the full experience I suggest you go to the World of Tanks website and download the full game but this game is great for those will less powerful PC/LAPTOP's.
15940,"Avoid all WarGaming.net games. They have garbage customer support and give you nothing but copy/pasted responses that assure you how much they care about you while simultaneously telling you to screw off with your problem.

If you do not like pay to win games, avoid this title. It's possible to play and have fun without spending money, but that only works up until about tier 5. After that, everything starts becoming a gigantic grind if you don't have the paid premium.

The physics are horrendous, a lot of shots will look like they went right into an enemy at a good angle, but nothing happens, not even a message saying that it was deflected.

And the top reason why you shouldn't play this game? You can't play with your friends. In WoT Blitz, the group size is limited to 2. That means you can play with exactly 1 friend. Not 'friends', just 1 friend. This game ends up feeling very lonely because of that and the fact that you can't talk to the enemy team and you can barely say 3 words in the chat because the character limit is so tiny. 

WarGaming also nerfs the stats on your tanks from time to time. So you can spend months grinding for that awesome tank, only to have WG pull the rug out from under you and nerf it into the ground as they just did in a major update/nerf.

I have a lot of hours in this game, and I had some fun, but ultimately I feel it was a waste of time. I would not reccomend this game to anyone."
15941,:(
15942,AWESOME GAME must get and its free
15943,"I thought this game from original World of Tanks, but the fact this game is from mobile ver and if u not problem about this, just try it"
15944,This game is like the mobile version only its bigger but I like how it kept its original game mechanics.
15945,"addicting. simple.fun.

needs voice chat..."
15946,This is basically a budget version of World of Tanks if you don't have the money. Oh wait... World of Tanks is free.
15947,Just bad... super ugly looking and doesn't sync with your normal WoT account progress so you have to start the grind over (and pay) again.
15948,"It's a fun game 

For some reason eventhough I have never played any other WOT game I am really good at this game
It's free so download it"
15949,"Been playing regular wot (eu) since closed beta 10 years ago, do yourself a favour and avoid this one, it's horribly pay to win, it constantly screams at you to buy loot boxes, if you thought War Gambling were bad on WoT then WoT Blitz's levels of greed will blow your mind.  They throw constant mini events which are a cynical snipe at your wallet, albeit disguised as a 'gift'.  The maps are tiny, the game has very limited options being a mobile game and it all just sucks a massive pp.  It joins a long list of games which are dying due to developer greed like Robocraft, Crossout, PubG, Destiny 2 etc."
15950,"Meh... not really a good game. Problem is that this game can get old fast. I don't mind other games that are repetitive, but your tank moves at a slow pace, which make this one tedious. Don't let the trailer fool you."
15951,It's a pretty fun game. 10/10 would reccomend
15952,"The console edition for Xbox and Playstation are far superior to this mobile port.  If you're going to play on PC, just get the full game from wargaming.net."
15953,"Really nice, community is not that toxic, but it's Pay to Win as fuck.

Play at your own risk"
15954,Good game for slower computers or if you don't have a good ipad or whatever device you have

15956,"This game is basicly just a port from mobile. What they did was only connect certain features with the keys and thats it. nothing was improved, the graphics and the resolution in game is just as good as it is in mobile (sarcastic) i cant even change the resolution. Wargaming could've atleast improve the graphics, retexture them to make it a more PC friendly game. My FPS was locked on 60 and sometimes it stays on the 50 or even 40 FPS. The only good thing about this game is that i can play it using keyboard and mouse. Do play if you can stand the horrible graphics"
15957,+
15958,"this game is Free to play BUT ITZ PAY TO WIN if you want the tanks to do the job you need to cough up the CASH Alot of it.
Itz not my idea of a free game."
15959,I do recommend this game due to the fact that it can run on older hardware but if you can run the regular world of tanks client id strongly suggest you play that insted.
15960,it made me fucking restart my account
15961,this game is good but moderators are idiots banned me from chat and deleted my nickname for me to pay gold
15962,"it's not the real World of Tanks, but it's a simple arcade game. it may be a mobile port, but it still runs well on my terrible laptop. it's well worth it, considering it's a free game."

15964,"I recommend this ONLY because it vaguely resembles the legit PC version of WoT that isn't on Steam. Seriously, if you like the concept of this, go download the full game (yes it's free) from Wargaming's website. It baffles me why it isn't here on Steam yet and instead WG put up the version that's designed for smartphones."
15965,"a pc port of a mobile port which was origionally for pc, also if u cant run origional WoT this is for all the potato pcs"
15966,"I will change my review to a positive one and let me explain why. I had initally said I would't recommend this game because you start off with a really basic tank that barely does any harm, while other players have more advanced tanks and consequently you get killed in very little time (which btw someone had posted a comment contradicting this by saying that all tanks are the same  level in one game, that's just false, no need to explain, it's simply there, they're NOT all the same level). 
However I played more yesterday and today, and I will admit that eventhough I am still not liking the slow upgrade process and all that, the game is:

1) Fairly entertaining.
2) Yes, upgrading is a slow process but eventually you will get there.
3) I mean, come on... after all it's a free game. Yes, there are some shortcuts you can take by paying some money but that's part of their marketing already. So that's fine.

So bottom line is, for a free game it's a pretty good one, and if you're willing to spend 2 or 3 hours biting the dust, getting practice and experience in order get your upgrades and then start enjoying  more, then go for it. 

And yes, I will apologize for my initial review. So that's it guys, and remember, never write a review while you're feeling frustrated! ;)"
15967,Quick 5-7mins matches with no arty 10/10
15968,Very fun and realistic! Runs like a dream even on slow computers!
15969,I am having a great time with this game!
15970,OMG THIS IS SOOOO GUD AURRRROHGGGGGG
15971,XD
15972,"yea this game is fun. pretty much like every tank game, but try, i think u will enjoy from this just dont expect something special."
15973,Love it Better then playing on the IOS!
15974,"A semi port of World of Tanks, feels like the ported straight from the ipod/ipad/iphone verison to computer, but still fun. Highly recommend that you have a friend with you, it will help in the battles."
15975,govno
15976,all the rejects who cant play the real version of tanks play this. you have all these idiots rush in with their light tanks and expect to destroy the enemy heavies. horrible idea from a horrible russian company.
15977,took my life away.. had to go to rehab
15978,"It's unbelievable how shitty the controls are and how much pay to win this game is, again those retards selling premium ammo in the shop, DON'T PLAY THIS GAME, teach those greedy russian devs a lesson.
p.s. The admin banned me when i was testing the game for saying this in the chat."
15979,900 hours of pure depression and agony.
15980,Still good
15981,why is this here? for people with shit pc to experience 2% of what World Of Tanks actually is? this is fucking stupid
15982,"7 v 7
smooth fps
no spg
but fckin cross platform
i love the old one"
15983,"Oh my what a good time to releashed on PC expecially in steam, i have been waiting for ages since they announce they will port to pc but unfortunately they did on windows 10 1st, kinda dissapointed a bit... the after a month they announce again but this time for steam. Finally a big hyped for me coz my device kinda outdated and old so i can continue my ingame progress, after they releashed beta version of it i jumped out and give a try its quite ok but got a little bug here my opinion WotB in PC generally not on steam only;


[h1] Pro's [/h1]
[list]
    [*] Give an opportunity to player that have low end smartphone device to play
    [*] Easy to play and not time consuming since the map are smaller than the WoT PC version
    [*] Micro transaction thingy much cheaper 
    [*] Since the maps very small its easy to spot an enemy even if your team camping fast tank can easily spot it instantly
    [*] NO FRIGGING ARTY 


[h1] Con's	[/h1]
[list]
    [*] An unfair advantage to its original port coz in pc the controls obvoiusly much better
    [*] Porting to PC thats mean bad, u know what i mean right? NO? ok i tell you, there a frigging a lot of bots in there when the game start ported to pc on windows 10, now on steam too?? rite no steam vac ban... thats mean u screwed up if you get team with them, its gonna be hard carry for you.
    [*] I know people nagging about slow tank tech tree and keep compare to PC version, i know PC have a lot tanks but think again how many years that PC version running, compared to this that have 1 year running in app store/playstore its very huge gap, the tech tree will added slowly so dont worry about it


Well here all my little opinion on this game, im sure most people that give comment already give a good reviews on this which u can read below thread have much more experience than me and yep im a WoT PC too, even console version and have more than 20k battle each... i recommend for casual player that doesnt want to spent a lot time in PC version play this.

7/10"
15984,"Nice adaptetion to pc, its almost better, than playing with tablet/phone."
15985,This is mobile port garbage. Go download the REAL game.
15986,no arty and better maps
15987,"Nice, based on Android and iOS Games, much better than mobile version"
15988,No Arty
15989,"This game is simply a shitty mobile port. If you want to play WoT on PC then play the PC version or play blitz on mobile, at least not this version."
15990,This game sucks. You're forced to spend more time going through upgrade menu's with constant prompts to buy the premium upgrades). It may be free but it's overly simplistic fr a PC gme
15991,Cool.. We have been waiting for it in Steam for so long
15992,"its like wot for 5 year olds, and no arty."
15993,Lag lag and more lag.  It happens especially with pedals as you'll notice when someone is constantly near you and able to make your tank slowly sink into the ground or continue forward without response.  This is made worse by seeing players automatically aim where the nearest enemy tank is and firing at walls! Why would you need an aimbot in a tank game anyways?  Couldn't recommend.
15994,Very dynamic and involving gameplay. Everything happens so fast! Highly addictive :-)
15995,nice
15996,no arty
15997,"So much worse than the full game, which is also free to play"
15998,"The WoT community is still and always will be a piece of shit, play War Thunder instead"
15999,Cross Platform with Phone players is a win in my book.
16000,oh i use to love this game on the cell phone and pc But now it has turned into a pay to win game.. If you dont have real money this game is not for you.. it is now a stright up pay to win game.. the Match maker well make sure you get on a sh ity team knowing that team well lose.. and if you dont pay money you well keep losing over and over again and on top of all that they as in people or hackers are useing mods to hack game to win do i blame them no i dont and plus if you ask me WARGAMING NEEDS TO BE HACKED more and more get-em hackers
16001,"If you are a hardcore fan of World Of Tanks, you may not like this versions of it. If you want a similar tank game without the arti and quicker matches this may be for you. The play style is very similar to WoT and the chat having limited character length cuts down on spammers and haters. Some UI stuff is lacking though. Overall I it like myself and recommend one try it. You can easily get a good feel for the game before you decide if you want to spend anything."
16002,Really fun game to play you will find yourself getting addicted to it.
16003,"played 12,000 games on normal WOT, and have just started playing blitz. Blitz's 7 v 7 matches gives a decent player a chance to carry most games and seal club like a boss in the lower tiers."
16004,"First off im going to give this a thumbs up...ish. LIke the cool steam skin for linking account.

-Now for the review. This is a fun game, BUT this is the mobile version of the game. I play World of Tanks and World of Warships the legit PC games. Those are amazing games.  Why not but your actual games on steam wargaming? I just dont understand. Blitz is a good game, but its not the quality of World of Tanks, World of Warships, or World of Warplanes. Bring those to steam please. Im sure they would be recieved with much praise."
16005,"TANKS TANKS TANKS> This is basically World of Tanks lite. A mobile game port for the computer. It's a great 7v7, quick, fast games of explosions and maneuver tactics. So choose between German, France, USSR, China, UK and USA tanks and battle. The tanks for all countries break down to light, medium and heavy tanks. Each tank has ( and countries) type of tank are designed with a specific playing style. But it really comes down to how good are you? your skills? Understanding your tanks ability and type of ammo/shooting and tactic, maneuvering is all key. LOCATION X 3. Yes, that saying, is how you play this game. There are daily missions and a tutorial mission to start you off with good gold/silver for upgrades or research points. Research unlocks tanks or crew skills, and gold/silver gets your tanks provisions, ammo, equipment, and camo. It's all about making your tank the best in every way possible to get that edge in battle. Faster reload or faster repairing? ammo penetration rounds or explosive rounds? Make your tank the way you want with upgrades. Very customizable. Plenty of camo skins so you look ''individual'' as you can as a heap of moving gun and metal...The maps are neat and with plenty of hiding, ambushing or sniper points for you tank. Games are a capture the point or destroy all other team tanks...up to you. Have fun and hear that BOOM! of your tanks gun, with the gunman yelling PENETRATION!"
16006,Has all the flaws WOT has and even more sadly
16007,"[This game is as good as unplayable on PC]
[You will load into the game 2 minutes late because you are on PC every time, this game has no exuse to load slow on actual machines]


A very deceptive game, you would think that because the game has tanks in it, that the ammount of armor you have on your tank has meaning... IT does not, Armor is about as usefull in this game as ducktaping paper sheets onto a wire-frame outline of a peice of shit.

Experience:// Maus, Ob.263, E-50M, IS-4, Vk28.01

Dont play this game unless you want to die to faggots using fucker bitch queer ammunition and get oneshotted by tanks that are fake at tier 10.

//

But in all seriousness I do get enjoyment form this game, You can play it on litteraly anything anywhere. You can learn a lot from this game, Much faster than you would learn from playing PC."
16008,Not bad game
16009,"I edited this. World of tanks blitz is awesome!


Pros.

Tons of tanks.

12 maps.

Can be played on mac osx

Freindly players always working together


Cons


There was lag at the start but you can change graphics settings


Its hard to get used to if you have played cod for a long time[ Trust me ]

There are ""people"" who cuss and are mean"
16010," Not much different from the actual PC WoT, just that there are no artilleries and interfaces and some others are made simpler. No Artilleries... If you don't like them, this will not frustrate you (I personally don't mind). Maybe one possible problem is the # of people in queue.... The matching is not as fast as PC WoT, or maybe it's simply because of time range when I play this game :)"
16011,"Great game. tons of content, easy to learn, and fun. 10/10 - IGN"
16012,"Dont mind 99% of review that make this game ""mixed review"" its written by dumb kids. 
You simply cant compare this version to PC version, same as you cant compare PC version to War Thunder or Armored Warfare. 

Yes, tank are same, with same spec, same stats, same behaviour and many maps you will recognize, but they are like 1/2 shorter, because its 7vs7 instead of 15vs15. 

When this game comes to tablets, I bought tablet for 300 USD to play it, but I was frustrated with controlling.  Then this game comes to Win 10, so I installed it..and again, even with keyboard and mouse controlling was still bad. 
Now game is in version 3 and its completely different. Controlling on keyboard and mouse is almost same as on PC version.  So if you hear about bad controls, ignore it.

Conclusion:
If you dont like classical version, because its full of cheaters, of because its taking too serious, its too complex and you dont want to waste your time in 15 vs 15 (I have over 2k hours in WoT on PC)  you can play this. 
Its fun. Its not serious.  Its fast 7vs7 game where each game is around 5 minute fast.  And there are no arties! So you can play slow T95 :D

TLDR:   This game is must have if you :
- hate arties
- hate bad matchmaking (classical game have +-2 tiers, here is only +-1 so tier 4 never met tier 6)
-  have low end computer
- have only low spare time (each battle take max 5 minute) 
- hate classic PC version, because cheaters and too much OP vehicles (in this version there are no autoloaders)"
16013,"World of Tanks Blitz,

Is at its core nothing more than a grind arena shooter.
You're pitted against eachother in team deathmatch and capture the base modes. (Both modes active at the same time)
By doing battle you earn experience and credits. With your earned rewards you upgrade your current tank, or you purchase a new tank.

But, how does it play?
The general gameplay is solid and didn't show any real bugs. The main issue that I've got with this game is the extreme grind factor, and the very clear ""Go premium to enjoy"" setting.
Don't get me wrong, you don't have to go premium to enjoy the game, but it sure takes away the grind. (Or as a Brii states: ""With premium you would have to grind maybe a few hours less then without premium.
But still you'd have to spend numerous hours and battles grinding."")

Did I enjoy it?
Yes I did for the first couple of rounds, Until I noticed that there's no real nation filter when it comes down what model of tank battles the other. Besides of that; the first few times things are not always as clear when it comes down to what upgrade to buy or not.

Is this a stayer?
Not for me. I like the different tank battles, but it'snothing new. There're better tank games out there, even more tactical ones. But, it's basically free and that's somewhat of a nice thing.
Still, I don't really see myself getting back into this game if they don't add some sort of single player / co-op campaign mode. Which they probably won't due to the fact that everything is geared towards PvP clashes."
16014,the Tank game is good yes (Indeed).
16015,"Great for low end PCs.  Objectively, it's a simple, fun little game.  What it lacks in depth, it makes up in quick match times and fast action.

However, if you have a PC that can run the regular version, play that instead."
16016,Fun and challenging
16017,"DISCLAIMER: Just because the huge-ass thumb above points up, doesn't mean I fully endorse this game.

I've played World of Tanks, World of Warplanes, World of Warships and World of Tanks Blitz, and WoT is my favorite out of them all. A cool, fast paced game. Great for a quick arcade-style game of action. This coming from a dedicated War Thunder player. Though WoT may not be the mose realistic game, it is definetley very fun. No, War Thunder isn't all that realistic either, but it has a more relistic feel to it. While most people don't consider HP bars and health points realistic, it gives WoT predictable gameplay. I stopped playing WoT after a few months, as I play the majority of my games on a crappy toaster, so it could barley run even the most simple games. About a year after, War Gaming came out with World of Tanks Blitz. At this time, War Gaming had a fairly bad reputation because of War Thunder. I decided to try it out. It was awesome. WG kept pumping out interesting and stable updates, keeping the game alive. Although it had the extreme P2P feel and grind, it was still loads of fun. I still play WoTB mobile today, and the release of WoTB on Steam was pretty cool. While Steam isn't the ideal place to put a MOBILE BASED game on, it did prove quite good. I expected my ""toaster"" to not be able to run it even on minimum graphics, but it proved very smooth and playable. After all, they probably just did a copy/paste of the game engine from a phone to a PC. Though I did find a few flaws: frame rates may be good, but it is very unstable. Controls have not fully adapted from mobile to PC. Mouse sensitivity is very sluggish, even when bringing it up. if you are familiar with mouse acceleration, this is exactly the problem. For those who don't know, mouse acceleration is the speed at which your cursor moves dependent on how fast you physically move your mouse. For example, if you physically move use slowly, the cursor will move slowly, and if you move your mouse fast, your cursor will move fast. And for a fast-paced game like WoTB, where multiple swipes/movements are required to keep up with your aim, this makes aiming very hard as it is very slow and unpredictable.

Another problame I found was when launching the game. The game hasn't been out on Steam long so there are bound to be bugs, specifically game launch bugs. Every time I launch the game via Steam, it says it needs to do the ""First Time Launch"" stuff with the ""Windows bla bla bla step 1 4908134"" or some crazy thing like that. (It's really just 3 steps) It took the game over half an hour to complete 2 steps and took another 20 mins to finish and launch the game. This does this every time. I was actually waiting for the game to load and decided to write this long-ass review. It almost an hour for it to boot up for the second time. In fact, in the middle of writing this paragraph the game decided to load up and interrupt me mid-sentence... :,(

Other than that, WoTB PC is exactly the same as the mobile version. I like it, but that's just my opinion.

P.S. thanks for reading this essay of a review."
16018,"Honestly this game is good but the people who hate it are not true WoT fans yes it is the mobile game but i am actually having fun even though most say it is p2w hell i even played both beta weekends

8/10"
16019,"...funny calm simple game to take your real life problems away...

Update patch 9.2.

Sound ""improvements"" went in wrong direction  as they sound like firing from musketeer gun....

just awful!"
16020,gg
16021,"Not a bad game. I'll write the bad things first: The interface is very slow, aiming is slow as hell too, you should make it quicker. Another problem is the zoom. You just can't zoom, its pretty annoying. A big problem is the seizure warning even for those who does not have epilepsy. I mean when you use scope, the shot makes a flash, and its already bad, but using machineguns is eyecancer. These are the big ones, maybe i forgot something. Graphics and sounds are not a big problem yet, cuz the game requires potato pc only. The upsides are the the things that are problems in the big game, so its good that there is no arty, smaller teams equals better balance, and bigger influence of ONE player. I like this one. First fix the uncomfortable interfacer, and then it would be awesome, if you would make also good graphics and sounds. I like this game."
16022,"Piece of Sh*t. I literally stood in place for the first 5-6 matches I played and won every round. No idea why this is being made, smaller maps, same exact items as previous title just feels dumbed down and for smaller matches."
16023,"Great game for underpowered laptops. Fun and fast paced. If you have a gaming rig, there are much better games out there. If you want something to play on a shitty school laptop (or similar), this game is great for that."
16024,"does not work!
click play then it shuts itself off... does not diagnose a problem or supply any info...glad i gave steam a second chance...:-("
16025,i know this is a mobile game but man does this look and run bad
16026,"[h1]The Good[/h1]
I've played World Of Tanks Blitz (WoT Blitz) since the Beta on my tablet. It was great, I got far enough to have a Tier X heavy tank.

Many are criticizing Wargaming for not giving them the PC version on Steam. Fair enough. But the reviews should be about THIS VERSION, not about some other game.

I think bringing WoT Blitz to Windows and OS X is a fantastic idea. Controlling the tanks with the keyboard and mouse is an improvement over the touch controls of the mobile version. By making the game cross-platform, it's really easy to continue your progress either on your computer, or on your tablet or phone.

One other major benefit of bringing the mobile game on the computers and not the other way around is that the game is very optimized to work on low powered low performance devices, so the game runs very smooth on pretty old computers and on laptops with sub-standard video cards for today's power-hungry games.

One other thing I like about this version is the game dynamics. With smaller maps and smaller number of players per match than WoT, the matches are shorter, but with more action (there's a lower level of camping than in WoT).

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
The development of new tank trees is pretty slow, and nowhere near the WoT Version.

The devs don't solve bugs very fast. I remember I stopped playing the mobile version for about six months or more, because they had a bug (which I reported on their forums) where every time you'd enter the game you'd be spam with friend invites from people you have blocked. :) On this version I found that, even though it says that a person is blocked, I can still see the spammer's/troll's messages on chat. :) The idea is not to expect for bugs to be fixed rapidly.

Some UI things are akward or lacking functionality: upside down chat history, friends can be seen somewhere in the chat page, no action on people directly from the chat (like friend invites).

There is still no Linux version, even though there is a OS X version (meaning there's somekind of openGL code that should work perfectly fine on Linux).

Also, they could improve the graphics options for computers. For example, on the iPad everything looks much better than on my PC, because it's rendering at a higher resolution. They could add an option to render at 2x, 3x the resolution, so the visuals look way better, even on low ress screens.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants almost the same fun that WoT offers, but in smaller chunks. It's great for people that are on the move, which may play on their gaming PC at home, but also on their laptop or mobile devices."
16027,"hello my name is pat and i want to give you a short comparison between blitz and the normal world of tanks

( and sorry if my english is bad its my second language )


blitz :

Pros, 

-small file size and easy to understand
-fast pasted combat that is arcade like

Cons, 

-absolute 0 Depth
-you cant change factions from the start
-graphics comparable with mario 64
-really bad pay to win
- it plays and feels like TankiOnline 
-it has no arty 

world of tanks :

Pros,

-amazing graphics 
-easy to understand but hard to master
-a really deep garage where you can customise (almost) everything while still keeping the look easy to understand
-more gamemodes
-frequent updates

Cons,

big file size (16 - 30 GB depending of the graphical settings)
some graphical settings might be too mutch for the low end computers
also pay to win

Conclusion :

If you like blitz you might aswell play Tankionline and Dear devs please leave blitz to the mobile and put the normal Wot (world of tanks) here !"
16028,"very fun game has 2 modes, well over 200 tanks some you can earn,some you win,some you buy... i like it cause it makes it more diverse. more tanks than not are fictional tanks but its still fun. different."
16029,"cant connect to game center, have to restart, rather not do that, and its a terrible port, controls are delayed a bit.

This is simple review, like or dont like, but it is here"
16030,its verry goood game! all download this game
16031,"this game so unplayable now, too much noobs invade the server, normal match = too much noobs, and ranked match is dying, no one play ranked match, 

better lose against 7x 70%wr enemy's, than 30% wr teammate surrounding you
farewell wargaming, server enviromental getting worse by the time

LightningJr here"
16032,"Goto http://worldoftanks.com/ and get the actual PC version of the game rather than Blitz. 
World of Tanks Blitz is the MOBILE varient of the game. 

Description says it is cross-platform but Mobile / PC cross platform isn't a very fair idea to players. Maybe between Console and PC bu otherwise, No.

The PC version of the game however is good. Compared to War Thunder, WoT is a more user friendly game that balances realism and gameplay more accuratly. Whereas War Thunder leans towards realism.

But under no circumstance get Blitz. The minute you play this game, you are declaring you play the sissy version of Tanks.
"
16033,"I was enthusiastic for the first 5 minutes. Thought maybe it'll be World of Tanks with a more casual audience or something. But this game in its current state just doesn't belong on a PC. It's not bad, but it can use some UI tweaking. Aiming does have an odd feeling for some reason, even after tweaking sensitivity, but it's not hard. Just not very natural.

What made me quit and uninstall is complete and total lack of any detailed in-battle and post-battle stats. No damage dealt, no number of kills, no nothing."
16034,I think World of Tanks is better
16035,"World of Tanks Blitz, not nearly as good as World of Tanks but still a great game compared to any of the other mobile ports we get on Steam. It is not nearly in depth as the full World of Tanks game, but I feel like I can recommend it to fans and newcomers alike anyway."
16036,it wont loud up and it ceaps crashing! :(
16037,"Its better than the windows 10 version.
i downgraded my OS to windows 7.."
16038,"[h1] My opinion [/h1]
I think this game isn't worth to download because you can get a better graphics quality, maps tanks in the full version of World Of Tanks (Search in google) the only reason I voted ""Yes"" is because I can't run this game on my mobile (Too weak for these graphics :( ) and I had to give a try in this game.

[b] Pros: [/b]
1. Good if you mobile can't run this game you can try it in your PC, [spoiler] even a toaster can run this game. [/spoiler]
2. Light size and downloaded really fast (Took for me 7 minutes to download).
3. Runs perfectly on PC (At least my PC).
4. Fast battles (Game takes between 2-5~ minutes).

[b] Cons: [/b]
1. If your mobile can handle the graphics not worth to download if you just can play it on your mobile everywhere.
2. Poor graphics.
3. Very limited tanks in the ""Tech Tree"".
4. Movement mechanics sucks better to play on your mobile it (You don't to point for me game where am I going OK?!).
5. Stupid auto zoom made to me a headache, on the PC version you can scroll with your mouse.

[h1] Summary: [/h1]
If you don't want to waste hours of downloading the full version of World Of Tanks or your mobile is too weak to run the WOT Blaze app download it.
After 1.3 of playtime I didn't enjoy the game especially by the graphics there are no differences between the mobile version and the Steam version.

Sorry for my weak English. :P"
16039,"Good game, well balanced, if you like tanks and have bad pc you will like this game"
16040,"Love this game. Has been playing it since iphones, and finally I can play it on my PC. Way more addictive than original WoT, mostly because shorter game sessions and easier start. 
Graphics could be better though."
16041,"Now, there's an actual okay WoT game for the PC, this isn't it because who would want to play such a game?
This is a port of a money grabbing mobile game, much better!"
16042,Nice! Awesome game. It's great to have a choice to play on mobile platforms or on the PC!
16043,I like it game!  I tried to play Blitz on iPad  but on Macbook is beter.
16044,"One must ask oneself; why?  Why release a phone/tablet app to PC?  Would you take a finely tuned, hand-built, sports car to the demolition derby?  Would you wear your Sunday finest to the gym?  Why in the world would you want to play a mobile app on a PC?  I suppose there are people who might want the finer control features of a PC to have an advantage against mobile app users; that's the only reason I could suspect someone might want to play this over playing World of Tanks."
16045,"I like this game.  You have a chance for some succses . Unlike world of tanks were I just got my ass handed to me all the time.  Game play and controls are simple . It's fun and easy to play ----------- After 3.8 update . The Game is a money grabbing  grind and no longer as much fun. It's to bad , I did like this game and spent a lot of time and money on it. but no longer .--------------Well I have to admit  i'm still playing this game. I've found ways to adapt to the change's , but still don't enjoy it like I used to. There have been small improvements. Hopefully they'll keep coming."
16046,"This game being on Microsoft Store was already kinda dumb (M+KB vs touch players really?...)
But now coming to Steam it's even more stupid... why? just why???

Just play the real game, it's not as bad as this mobile game,
even if your PC is not that good playing WoT at PS2 graphics (minimum settings) it's way better than playing Blitz that looks like a PS1 game and plays like shit comparing to the real deal"

16056,"Unless you have a really low performance computer, just play World of Tanks. More machines, better looking, larger player base."
16057,"Checked it out for 21 minutes...forced me to play thru some tutorial, locked me into choices I didn't want, installed some other software. It sucks...stick with normal WoT."
16058,"This is, in a nutshell, World of Tanks lite. In fact, it's literally the same game that you can get on your iOS device. You may ask youself what the point of putting WoT mobile on the same platform you could play the real WoT on, but the difference, simply, is that if this can run on an iPhone it can run on ANYTHING. 

I personally have never been able to play WoT on my computer, because I have a Macbook. Heck, I can barely even run Minecraft on this thing, but WoT Blitz runs 60 FPS without even sweating. That alone makes it worth it for me, at least."
16059,Runs suprisingly smoothly on my sandwich
16060,"played this everytime I got bored from studying, 25 hours well spent time

10/10 dont play this shit if you're on mobile, you'll get rekted by noobs like me"
16061,same piece of random shit like regular pc version. absolutely nothing depends on player skill
16062,"Sorry WoT, but you jsut can't compete on steam with War Thunder

Yet another mobile game ported to steam. even though it is by a big name, it still sucks."
16063,"Good thinks:
Works on slow PCs
Fast MM
Bad thinks:
Bad graphics(why did you put on steam the mobile version,a least make graphics more beautyful.
"
16064,20 hits without recordig the hit though all thehits are in gray area and the middle of the tank
16065,"If you thought outdated graphics of original WoT was too good, and wanted something less.
Otherwise, the same exact boring uninspired game."
16066,Only good thing about Blitz is that there is no artillery unlike in regular WoT. Other than that - just play mobile version and forget about it being on Steam.
16067,"Legal, mas podia ter server pra america do sul"
16068,"Best game i play, easy control, play on any device (pc,mobile,tab), and i play it since this game appear in windows store (Play in pc and in ipad)"
16069,"why i can't sign in with google+!!
Do something!!"
16070,Its a Fun Game to play!!
16071,"[b]Pros:[/b] The game is [i]alright[/i], unlike its main version mostly doesn't require much to run except a good internet connection. Most people are displeased that they added this game on steam and not the main version but at least it has some differences for users so that they could continue the battle on their phones.
During battles, most people use tactics to overcome the enemy: Cover, Communication, and Teamwork.

[b]Cons:[/b] It's true that this game doesn't have as much graphical content as the main one (I haven't played the main WoT in years and sorry that I don't know whats new) but micro-transactions are extremely expensive in game, I got a $25 I-tunes card and I couldn't really get much from what it has to offer, that's quite a bit of money for just 1 premium tank or for $20 is only 6,075 gold which only gets you a premium tank in the Tier 6 area and lower.

The summary of this review just concludes that this game is meant for people who wanna grind a lot (If you don't wanna pay over $50 for a few things). Different servers separate people in different countries but mostly servers run really well, updates are during when people sleep so it wont cause much of a hassle and like every multiplayer competitive game people get upset at you if you're last alive and don't win."
16072,"To all people asking ""why is this on steam"" : SIMPLE , because it is not generating enough cash for Wargaming and it's currently a ""fluke"" so they needed the help of steam to pump in some fresh suck... players. Why isn't the normal version on steam? Simple. Because they don't need it to be on steam having a lot of suckers that pay them a ton of money for some pixel shooting (especially from Soviet Russia that just enjoy the superiority of their tanks in this game)

Now about the game :

Just the same in almost everything except graphics with the normal version. That means [b] rigged match making[/b] (a.k.a when you win too much suddenly you get extremely stupid and with stock tanks players  in your team) ) , [b]rigged RNG[/b] (""random""(rigged) number generator - meaning shots tend to miss more often sometimes to laughable extend like missing from point blank with the most accurare gun in the game, or hitting the target from the other side of the map with the most inaccurate gun in the game  or shot going to areas you did not aim for and auto-bouncing) , [b]players that PAY [/b] to have premium account will have the [b]clear advantage[/b] against the non paying players meaning they can afford  spending premium ammo without fear of loosing too many credits and go on a minus. Using premium ammo means that you chave the luxury (I'm talking about average to good players) not wait to aim for weak spots and as such go back to cover quickly and obviously not be hit => live longer and do more damage => win more. Basic logic. So this is not pay to win but a redefined PAY TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE that translates into winning more. Sneaky belorussians. Also paying players will be able to have a better crew faster , better tanks faster ..and that means going from frustrated to having a decent experience in the game.

Now they are busy realeasing premium tanks in spams and many of your bought pixels will end up hit by the power creep (meaning what you bough 1 year ago ,will be shit now because they kept introducing premium tank after premium tank that made you "" bought pixels"" completely useless or weaker. This game has absolutely NO BALANCE in real game terms. It has some sort of idiotic rules (scouts do the scouting , tds to the camping , heavies do the fighting ,  mediums d o everything and artys do the rng -  lol, In fact , all tanks do the rng to some extent and this environment is probably the most rigged game I ever played. It just doesn't show you all what is going on. Imagine that even the best players that platoon a lot and spend a ton of money to play only with certain crews , tanks , consumables , etc ... barely pass the 65-70% general winrate.

My best advice to you, stay clear of this money grabbing game. It's only purpose is to frustrate you so you can cash in. If it's not  obvious now it will be in a few week of playing it. If you are masochist that enjoys this game without cashing in... well good for you there are tons of paying , 4 skill crewed , and upgraded tanks players that will enjoy raping you :D (source : a former WOT player)

What i could recommend for a change for this game (they don't listen anyway as long as there are enough imbeciles with their wallets in Russia) will be to make the RNG to max 5% (right now it is as 25-30%) ,better MM, remove any advantages for paying players - make it like in DOTA2  -  paying players should only have visual stuff that do not give extra , faster grinding , better crew , spamming premium ammo without fear of negative income ..etc. premium tanks should ramain but no power creep , stop releasing OP tanks so players pay money to free xp and get them first to pwn the battle field etc. Basically offer a fair playing environment to paying/ non paying customer. Yeah right...
Ain't nobody got time fo' that."
16073,"This is like World of Tanks but without artillery, with a lot better matchmaking and faster battles. A great game."
16074,"Pros:
-Perfect for those who cant play WoT on pc bcause hardware limitations.
-Fun for having such small maps.
-Great Community.

Cons:
-A litle bit of P2W.
-Matchmaking is alittle bit drunk.
-As stated above the map is too small.

Conclusions:
Overall a really great game. Perfect replacement for those who have toasters who want to play WoT. And for those who say ""Why u no put original WoT in Steam"" think about those who have toasters instead of a PC.

7/10"
16075,Kinda bad graphics. Original WoT graphics was much better. Bad quality
16076,"I honestly don't know why this game is on steam, It's just a wattered down version of WoT. It will run better than WoT on lower end PC's, Then again, If you can't run WoT there's a mod that compresses the textures to improve FPS. Hell, Even my crappy laptop can pull 60FPS on min settings 720P with compressed textrues were as without it cant pull over 13. So I don't understand what WG was thinking when they desided to put this game on steam, It's not a bad game on the phone or anything, That's not what I'm saying. I just don't see much point to having it on PC and Steam. Better yet, People have been asking for WoT to be on steam for litlery years now. WarGaming doesn't do that, But here! Have the mobile version... Despite the fact you've played the normal PC version of WoT for over 5-6 years... On the bright side, There isn't any arty to worry about... So that's quiet nice if I do say so myself... Plus there's the old un-nerfed T18 for some dank seal-clubbing. Who doesn't want that :^"
16077,"The false sense of satisfaction you get when you ram your Panzer into a M4 Sherman while it has 42 health and you have 117, only to have your tank explode on impact and his lose 16 hp.  

10/10 would suicide panzer again

(Plz nerf M4A3E2 mass, too heavy for a Pz III/IV to suicide rush while at low health, so stupid)"
16078,"I played WOT for 4 years and in the begining game was awesome and fun. Also very competetive. 

Then, paying no attention to what their players wanted, they introduced changes that totally messed up the game and 90% of players hated what they were doing. There were around 250+ people online at any given time, now it is barely 50-60k inthe PEAK time. So trust me when i say that they only want to drain money from the users, not make something fun and competetive.

I only wish you saw the WOT how it was before....a lot more ballanced and skill did the fighting, not wallets.

dont...Just dont...."
16079,"Realy cool, better than other game about tanks :)"
16080,"-No controller/joypad support 

-No artillery tanks

-Maps that let the match finish in not even 2 minutes making the game more a rush to kill instead of a strategic game like the original WOT was.

-Overall less tanks

-Controls with keyboard+mouse are UNPLAYABLE

I would not suggest this game at all.If someone want to play WOT get the original WOT and not this unplayable crap."
16081,"Blitz is pretty much WoT with a few differences:
-Small maps
-7v7 (as opposed to 15v15)
-no artillery (most complain that they were in WoT, now they complain they they're not, wtf)
-mobile support (not as graphically pleasing, but its not bad)

with these changes it makes the matches much faster! Not waiting 10 mins for that last guy to make a move just to die... Some complain about the mobiles player. hey easy target! whats to complain about? More maps unlock as you reach higher tiers."
16082,Fast and fun.
16083,Good game. I am recommending this game.
16084,5/10
16085,Don't
16086,"Well .... to be honest .... it is a good game .... in short GG ;)
Before you read this please switch off your PC/Xbox/Playstation/whatever-just switch off ffs !!!"
16087,"Not bad tho, a shittier version of WoT."
16088,"Хуйня какая-то.

Не рекомендую тратить время на это."
16089,very good game

16091,Ну такое
16092,"I played the game for a long time on mobile and i have to say that on a pc it:
-Runs better
-You are able to have much better graphics
-controls are better
-great game in general and well made

Even though i know Blitz doesn't even compare to the full game it's still a great game for people that want quick action packed games, and dont have high end PC's
-Plus no arty"
16093,80%
16094,"+ No SPGs.

10/10

Best game ever."
16095,fuck you
16096,"Instead of this boring version, add the PC World Of Tanks.
Will be better than this"
16097,Wolę normalnego wota ale ten też jest dobry
16098,"slow pace i rather stick to the original world of tanks , but for beginners its fine but if you already played world of tanks the difference is big"
16099,"Great game!  I play this game more then 2 years on Android phone,and now i can play on steam,thats great!  :)"
16100,"It's World of Tanks with the same retarded teams but WITHOUT ARTY!

Serb/10"
16101,good game.
16102,:D
16103,"Play this game if you hate waiting 30secs before you can start blowing things up.
Play this game if you hate scumbags / skycancers.
Play this if you like quick matches.

Don't play this if you want a lot of depth.
Don't play this if you are an SPG player.
Don't play this if you are a unicum.

I play Blitz when I got bored, which is usually after two hours of losing streak on my real World of Tanks account."
16104,Good Game u should try this game 10/10
16105,"Mobile Port

War Thunder is still better"
16106,"Pros:
- No SPGs
- Unlike Real PC version of WoT, You can buy camo peamamently at cheap price. (Only 2000 Coins!)
- You can link your mobile ID to this port, Or link this PC ID to your mobile.

Cons:
- Only have 7 players on each side in 1 match.
- Its Dont have auto driving button like Real PC version of WoT.
- Battle interface is confusing af. (Especially if you play Real PC version before)
- Minimap is so small
- Camera view is Worse than WT
- Sniping camera is randomly zoom in-out
- Worse MM than Real PC version
- Tons of OP Premium tanks in match. (Especially Event tanks or Anime tanks)
- Despite shitty graphics and smaller battle size, WG still sell Premium tanks at same price as PC version!

WG, Why you port this mobile game to PC instead of linking your main PC game to Steam? If you (WG) want to competitive with Gaijin's WT, You shouldn't do a cashgrab game like this!"
16107,"This game was made for phones and it should stay on phones.

Controls are hard. sniper mode is hard and there are more noobs than in PC platform."
16108,"Seriously. An original WoT battle is basically a 20-minute-long artillery and tank destroyer standoff simulator, filled with aimbotting-xray-cheaters.

A WoT ""Blitz"" battle is a lot smaller and shorter. The player count per team is cut down to 7vs7. The game mechanics are a lot simpler too. No radio upgrades, etc.

Blitz really helps you focus on the very things that make WoT fun. It's only 1.4Gb. Try it out, play a couple rounds with your friends. I think you'll enjoy it!

8/10"
16109,gg
16110,Please merge Korean WoT server into SEA Server.
16111,Just download & play!!!
16112,"It's a mobile World of Tanks, and by mobile it's literally the same game on android and ios.

Differing from World of Tanks PC however, this thing doesn't need a nuclear reactor and a pair of quantum computers to run smoothly. Anything with Intel HD graphics or up can run this on lowest setting, resolutions adjusted. 

Gameplay-wise, it's a bit... weird, so to speak. Being a WoT game, the detection system relies on radio and actual visibility, the usual stuff. What's disorienting is just how high up your camera is. You literally can see to the end of some maps, but your enemies won't pop up until they're literally in front of you.

Grinding is actually pretty fair, is a bit tiresome in the upper tiers. Unlike the PC version where money is always short and premiums are OP, this one has even more OP premiums but fairer and more plentiful money earning system. The free boxes thing that drops you anywhere from 10 thousand measly silver coins to an entire bloody premium tank (which are treasures if you want to grind for more silver coins) really helps too. There are also LOADS of one-off premiums which are cool looking, though sometimes they're much too OP to ever be left in the playing field at all (I'm looking at you, T6 Dracula)!

Since it's only 7v7 as opposed to 15v15, it's quite frustrating if one or more of your team is afk. One player can make all the difference between a blatant curbstomp or a total victory. The rating system helps though, people that afks often will have bad reputation.

All in all, this game is what it is: a more accesible World of Tanks.

Tips for starters: Rush the KV-2 and enjoy the durp 150mm xaxaxaxa"
16113,"I have been playing This game for a long time now and this will be my first review.

World of Tanks Blitz is Like WoT pc but this one is a mobile port which you can find on Playstore and appstore And funny thing is this game was a mobile port of WoT pc then this game got ported to PC which is now currently here on steam.

The game Plays through a 7v7 +1/-1 Matchmaking with over 200 unique vehicles to master from Germany, Japan, France, UK, USA, USSR, and China.

 The difference of this game from its Brother WoT is the matchmaking the tanks, small maps, Teams and the 7 minute match.

Every match of your game is limited to 7 minutes you either destroy all enemy team or Capture the base to victory.

Let's start with the matchmaking i explained it earlier that the game's matchmaking is +1/-1 and on it's brother the WoT it runs on e a ±2 battle using the 3/5/7 template (three vehicles at the top, five in the middle, and seven at the bottom) or one of its variants (e.g., 3/4/8, 3/3/9, etc.).

Moving on with the tanks the WW2 tanks are pretty much same as the WoT PC but there are still some tanks on the tech tree missing or to be added in the future but also there are Fantasy tanks. by fantasy tanks i mean is they are tanks that should not be existing in this game which is focused on WW2 tanks but wait some of the Fantasy tanks are balanced and cost alot of money to get one and they are time limited so you won't be seeing much of them.

i only remember the first ever fantasy tank added to the game was the Tankenstein it was a limited WG halloween XP grind event and was never repeated and it's a rare tank to see in matchmaking Following Fantasy tank not in order are:O-47, Lupus, IS-2SH, Edelweiss, Nameless, Hellsing, T6 Dracula and 40k tanks the Vindicator Ultramarines and Predator Ultramarines.

I Really Recommend it Because it has a lot of events and has daily reward system that helps new players to earn gold, credits, boosters, etc and free premium tanks! which is lucky for the new players they have a high chance of getting a good premium.

Update 2:Events Now The events on this game is really fun you can have alot of stuff for free but you just have to grind for it well some of this game's event is sometimes easy or hard most events.

Usually the events are special tanks which are always guranteed a premium and rare at first but you can get them again on the next few events that this game will held and so on."
16114,"Warning. This is not a game. You can only click highlighted buttons, buy upgrades which game forces You to. You can't even buy a tank You want. I downloaded this piece of crap only to drop this review. 
Just go play War Thunder."
16115,Kinda best wot games for low pc so THUMBS UP
16116,"the matchmaking is shit neither random or rating battle both are shit, why the fuck would u put a one player with 60%+ WR with 6 player with below 45%WR and put 7 50%+ player on the enemy side?
where is the fair matchmaking????
keep adding useless premium tank that the price is equal to AAA game
NERF tank that already is good and fair and buff the good stat tank even more powerfull"
16117,Most people are gonna get mad about the armour and the way the bullets work but I played the original world of tanks and this although its a little different in things such as map size its still fun to play in world of tanks the original version alot of battles could be dragged out so all im saying is dont judge it until you play it.
16118,such fun. much tank. 8.5/10
16119,"go play real world of tanks or war thunder or amoured warfare 
i have no idea who and why they thought this would be a good idea
only answer, CASH GRAB!
UPDATE
as of update 3.8 the game is even more pay to win."
16120,Play World of Tanks if your pc can run it. It is just the ported mobile version. Low budget.
16121,"great game, fun to play, fast, easy, convenient. and did i mention fun and very awesome, oeioke will talk shit about it like ""oh its a mobile import the pc version is better"" blah blah who cares?! what matters is that its F.U.N. sure it doesn't have everything the original has but it's great for people who just want to get in the action with the basic world of tanks feel and gameplay."
16122,"It's good if you are going somewhere with a tiny laptop
and you have wi-fi (Not that strong, just enought) , the game will run perfect !

And about the gameplay itself, it's litteraly world of tank
i feel like the progression might be slightly faster, but not sure about that 
faster battles and more tiny map, So always action when you play  
And we went from 15v15 to 7v7 in world of tanks blitz which feel more comfortable for the Tablet / SmartPhone / Weak laptop configuration.

It's a simply a world of tank that you play when you aren't home, of if you have a pc too much of a potato to run the actual real game....

I simply wish they would released World of tanks Pc on steam, maybe in the future or maybe never don't know we'll see"
16123,"World of Tanks Blitz is at the forefront of future gaming : crossplatform (PC / Smartphone / Tablet, Windows / Mac OS / Android / IOS). This already exists for turn based genres such as card game but Wot Blitz is one of the first in real time games.

World of Tanks (PC) has been enjoying a huge success since 2010. It is the 5th best-selling PC digital game of 2015. Why play Wot Blitz on PC ?

Graphics: granted, Wot Blitz is a step behind regular Wot. But many successful games have proven that graphics are not the main point: Minecraft, Unturned, League of Legends, DFO in Asia, TF2, you name it…

Gameplay: Wot Blitz is similar to Wot except for 2 main points. First point: no artillery. Artillery prevents camping. But in an objective based game, camping is detrimental. Second point: team size (7 vs 7) is significantly smaller. This is a major improvement for 2 reasons. It is impossible to coordinate 15 players in regular World of Tanks. And in a smaller team each player is more important and can really impact the game and carry.
Overall, after many years of experience, Wot Blitz is an updated and improved version of Wot.

F2P: if you want immediately all the new toys, Wot Blitz is very expensive. One premium tank costs the price of a full game ! Don’t go that way. This is true for every F2P game: if you want all items it becomes the most expensive game of the world. 
You are given some gold at the beginning. Don’t waste it ! Save it for buying slots at discounted price during an event.
The grinding process to buy and improve free tanks is slow. But patience is required in any F2P. More importantly, by grinding you improve your player skill. Moving up the tiers with real money is detrimental because you will face new maps and good players will crush you.

Overall Wot Blitz is a worthy product full of fun and of challenges. It takes time and patience to become a skilled tank pilot !
"
16124,"i dont understand why they release this game on Steam, if you already can find them in Windows Store, so i guess its only for Mac OS user, but Mac OS already have Desktop WOT so... idk :| 
btw, i have WOT B on my windows laptop so i removed this after 1 battle."
16125,"This game is a mixed bag. This game does not bring any new innovation to this genere/game type. This game had so much potentional of being good but failed upon that. This game does not look anything that the thumbnail of this game suggested, it looked like more of a ""sci-fi tank genre"" in the thumbnail then modern. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying modern is bad, all I'm saying is, many other companies like ""War Gaming"" has already done this type of game and theirs is much better in terms of effects and whatnot. There's frankly nothing exciting or new here. I do understand that this is a BETA game, and I may change my review if the following changes:

- More detailed maps--->better graphics (I don't mention on improving graphics in many reviews, because I get the target auidence that the company is trying to fullfill, but I believe the target auidence for this game are for those who want immersion and a better graphical experince. I understand that this is a free to play game, but on that same note, ""World of Tanks"" is also free to play with much better graphics.

- Better physics--->I'm not sure what is off with the physics, but I do detect something is dull about it. I think the explosion of the projectiles upon impact needs improvement as well as mechnics of the tank itself.

- Needs more gamemodes, not just elimination, the gamemodes are crazy fast; needs to be gamemodes where you can select what you wish to play *(Although I suspect that they will be adding this feature later on)

- The 60FPS cap needs to be removed. I could not find such way to remove it in the settings tab. Let the users decide if they wish to have a 60FPS or not, I have a 140Hz monitor with dual 1080's in SLI, and I wanted to get above 60FPS, and I was not able to.

- The above point is making me lead into my second point, they should support multiple GPU setups for those who have such luxary to do so. 

- I also notice those lines on the edges of objects (e.i tanks, boxes, battlefield decor, etc.)--this is a result of having limited graphical settings with no AA option. Please fix this too.

- Give incentives to players who are not ""premium"" users (so all the free users.)--->let's not forget that the free users make up majority of this game, and there should be more incentives (WITHOUT making the premium feel uneeded, but have the less ""pay to win"" vibe going on.)

If these are fixed, I may give the game a second go, but for now I cannot recommend the game in its current state. It is, however, a good time killer, I suppose, and that's what it'll ever be until they make more improvements which give players incentives to keep coming back and playing more."
16126,"Its not a bad game but its like WOTs for children, i would stick with other one if your over 10 yrs old."
16127,What is there to say? Its free and You get to drive tanks... so why are You reading this?
16128,Poor mans World of Tanks
16129,"If the original World of Tanks its too much for you (and believe it is for a lot of people), this one is just right for you, accessible minimum requirements, faster paced than its older brother, perfect for casual play, you dont need many hours to achieve stuff, i really like this one"
16130,A phone port of a bad PC game. i don't kow why this even exists.
16131,Awesome one!
16132,Great game! Finally the sky is clear of artillery)
16133,Release the real World of Tanks on PC you cunts at wargaming
16134,every match have 2 - 5 afk player
16135,"Pro
Blitz is fast and fun, with no artillery.
There only 7 players per side and maps are fairly small.
Thus each battle is quick.
Less tanks per level, that good or bad.

Con
WOT will NOT credit your old account with this game, thus you have to purchase gold and/or work up though the tiers.
Blitz will charge credit fors everything, including camo for each battle, slowing your process down to advance up the tier levels.
You cant communicate very well with other players, unless you platoon with one other before hand.
Matchmaker is as screwy as WOT, but there will be only one tier different, which helps some.
Clans are smaller, max limit of 50 members.
Dont waste your gold/credit on Premium tanks, they not worth it.
Dont waste your gold on tank upgrading option. Use your gold to exchange for free experience, and use that free experience for reserching improvements instead. You get more bang for your gold.
This game is a money mill got Wargaming Inc. If you dont care to throw money at it, you can advance fairly quicky, otherwise playing for free will taking a very long time and your win rate will suffer for it.

Download it and try it out. Myself I dont plan to advance past tier eigth when I finally reach it....Already spend 80 to 100 bucks, and I refuse to spend more.

Good Hunting"
16136,I LOVE THIS GAME
16137,Mobile game.
16138,"The only benefit of this over WOT Blitz from the Microsoft Store is: Less Microsoft! And also you get to choose where to install it, when to update it, etc.
Plus, updates actually work, whereas from the MC Store, getting updates in time is hit or miss, and you cannot play without the latest update."
16139,"[strike]France and[/strike] China tech tree to OP

Edit: French tanks have been added"
16140,"You're on a PC download the actual game from War Gaming's website, but I will say that this one is nice for older computers."
16141,"Wargaming: Hey, we should put our games on Steam. People would like that right?
Steam Players: Yes, we want World of Tanks on Steam!
Person: See? They want it.
Wargaming: Okay!
Person: Alright so we just need to set up our pa-
Wargaming: Put the mobile game on there.

Edit: Someone explain to me why World of Warships is on here in full glory but World of Tanks isn't??"
16142,"Played a few matches and it was too much already. As a side note, I got over 25k WoT battles under my sleeve but I only play some 5-10 matches each month these days because it's way too broken, the players in randoms are horrible, and there are better games out there (yeah, talking about both WT and AW).

WoT Blitz on PC is a thing that should not be - graphics are 1997-ish, players just as bad as in WoT, all in all it's a very boring grindfest that does not deliver anything special.

P.S. I played Beta and I quickly uninstalled it. I have absolutely no illusion that the ""final"" product will get better. It starts with a rotten foundation."
16143,"Normal game- P2W

16144,lol go get it on mobile why would you even bring this over to pc
16145,I have played the full game of World of Tanks for years........Having done so I just cant play this version. The visuals are strange and it seems to force a weird isometric view when in 3rd Person / Tank to allow enemy to be seen easier. It is a bad adaptation for a version that is made for mobile devices. I am sure war gaming will plug some money from this and then go and release the full version eventually on Steam. Play the PC version of the game not this one as it is worse than trying to play it on a mobile phone.
16146,"excelent tank game , its not difficult"
16147,"THIS IS HORRIBLE! there is literally no reason to play this game. it is a horrible port of a mobile game, and i don't even understand why they did it. World of Tanks was a PC game first anyway... go play the proper version. 10x better graphics, 100x smoother controls and 1000x better UI."
16148,If you're done with WoT (PC version) congrats you found another game.
16149,"I need No point in playing this game. Just go play world of tanks, This is just the moble version of it but on steam.


Im not even joking around. dodo"
16150,This game is awesome. I play it on my smartphone all the time. And that's my problem with this game being on Steam. This is a PC I'm writing this review on. I'd rather play the full WOT game on it instead of a mini version designed for my smartphone.
16151,A cool game
16152,"+1/-1 matchmaking
No Arty"
16153,PC version still better but if you hate arty that much here ya go.
16154,"     World of Tanks is a great game and for it to come to Steam is a huge success as this action might bring it more attention.The only problem people may have with this game is the fact that it is Blitz. For people on the computer which most people are they can play the pc version of the game. The Blitz version was brought after the pc version for mobile devices.Because of this BLitz is far behind the pc version of the game for example not having all the tank trees or having a big factor of the game the physics changes and environmental changes.With those changes it has made some tanks become very fast and some very slow. That has brought more of a different play style for each tank type and differently skilled players. It is true that in the future Blitz will have these improvements but for now i do not suggest this game to veteran players of World of Tanks but new players that want to pick up the game.
"
16155,"this is just absolutly terrible. I dont understand why anyone would want to choose this version over the pc version of WoT. THe graphics are terrible, gameplay is subpar. Why do you want mobile performance on a pc?"
16156,"A poor substitute for pc WoT, stay away from this mobile port unless you reaaaally need WoT but can't run it."
16157,"[h1] Somewhat detailed thoughts from a casual fan: [/h1]

I've been eagerly awaiting this game's arrival to steam in order to attract an even larger playerbase.

WoT: Blitz is effectively the scaled down version of the venerable World of Tanks PC game. A much, much  smaller scale, boiled down version of it's 'father', made in order to bring the experience to a much, much wider market.

I play this game on my phone on break at work, come home, play on my computer sometimes.

It is a far more casual version of the daunting world of tanks franchise, and subsequently (to the chagrin of some of the more elitist gamers) much more accessible.

The detriments are large but outweiged by the positives.

[h1] CONS: [/h1]
[olist]
[*] Absolutely abhorent community at least 60% of the time. You need only look on the forums here or the comments to get a taste. Some people can ignore this, some cant.
[*] Past tier 6 the cash shop premium crap begins to get unbearable. It's more managable than the regular world of tanks game, but still absurd for someone who plays casually. You actually LOSE money sometimes if you don't play perfectly and use better ammunition types.
[*] Balance can be questionable, but never completely and utterly broken from my experience.
[/olist]

[h1]PROS:[/h1]
[olist]
[*]A game you can truly take anywhere, provided you have a tablet or phone that can run it.
[*] A game for potato computers and lower end things, runs beautifully.
[*] The tank combat at it's core is deceptively simple at first, but you soon learn how positioning is just as much of a battle as aiming. It is punishing when you fail, but the most rewarding thing imaginable once you succeed.
[/olist]

All in all I highly recommend this game, it's free to play and worth giving a shot at the very least. 
[Spoiler] Just please don't make the community worse [/spoiler]"
16158,Why the hell are people mad about a World of Tanks with no arty?
16159,Amazing game. Recomend it.
16160,"I downloaded this on the second BETA run.

My son and I thoroughly enjoy playing this. One of the features I most appreciate is that I can play it on my Tablet PC or iPhone. However I must say my hat goes off to anyone who has mastered playing this on their phone.

I also appreciate the fact that the developers have made this available for free and that you can easily play, win and progress without paying $$$ to play. Since I don't believe anything should be free and we enjoy playing this so much, I have happily spent my hard earned cash in the game which enables you to enjoy more tanks and faster experience.

I'm sure many die-hard WOT fans will consider this trivial in comparison to the full game but for those of us who like to pop-in and out for a quick distration now and then it's a perfect format.

We enjoy playing this game so much we started our own Clan MAYHM; look us up when your in the game and feel free to appy for membership, we will be dissmissing many members with preference towards players from STEAM.

Look me up - MetalMayhemMaster

Happy hunting!!!"
16161,Great game. I have played the PC version for years and love this one as well. The shorter battles allow for some quick action and not a lot of dedication
16162,Good Game 100/100
16163,"Why on earth is this here? This is a mobile game, just go download the PC/Mac version on Wargaming's website which actually has a resolution higher than a potato. My computer runs battlefield 1 yet struggles to manage this. Definitly not for PC, go download the real version of the game. Plebs."
16164,"Very fun, while it lacks that of the full game it doesn't require a top of the line computer to run"
16165,"It's a PC port of a mobile game based off of a PC based RNG cash-grab grindfest.

Would honestly rather drag my cock through four miles of barbed wire than play this again."
16166,"Just dont, Its horrible"
16167,"For what it is its fine, nothing wrong with it. I have already played this from the Windows store and on my phone, its the same deal. Just the fact that they brought the Mobile version to steam instead of the proper PC version makes absolutely no sense."
16168,When Your PC is Low end but you still want play WoT.
16169,Useless game. Play wot instead
16170,"I liked this game!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31G8bK-aiPo"
16171,10/10 would mercilessly club mobile users again
16172,wow what a shit game
16173,"While it may just be a mobile port it does make it easier on the PC VS the Normal Version, It Makes it easier on both The PC and the Mobile Device (In my case a Galaxy S6 and An A6 3650). For Low Spec systems this port aint half bad"
16174,"Literally just World of Tank but worse, go play the better version"
16175,"First of all, I first played War Thunder on my PS4 because back then there weren't much games offered on the console. I got hooked and got serious so I installed the PC version of War Thunder. I never looked back to playing on my PS4 because the controls of keyboard and mouse were just natural to me. 

Fast forward a year after getting married and there is just not enough extra time to play the game on the PC. I suddenly saw World of Tank Blitz on the android store and I tried it. The concept of a tank having HP was alien to me because in War Thunder once you get shot either you die or you live. Then I began to learn the mechanics and did a switch from War Thunder to Wot Blitz. Fine it's a played down version of WotPC but the matches approximately last only 7 minutes a round and I carry it in my pocket. I got hooked. 

The mechanics of the game are pretty complex once you get past tier 5. You realize the weaknesses and strengths of each country and tank in particular. You also notice that players get a little more talkative and mean because it really is competitive in the higher tiers and people want to keep their win rates up.

All in all I installed it on my ANDROID phone, my wife's IPAD and now my laptop. It's the perfect game for those who don't have much time on their hands or those who are always moving around. 

I love the game. First bunch of people who did cross platform right. No wonder the owner is one of three billionaires involved in the gaming industry. 

I already have a year's worth of playtime in this game through handheld devices. Can't wait to try it on my laptop."
16176,definetely awesome ! a nice mobile game. now even better. we can play in both plataform. :D
16177,"Very good game absoulutely loved the mobile version and glad its here now on steam.
This game is a vast paced ww2 tank game with an objective of kill all players or capture an important point.
Includes multiple styles of tanks and customisation.
Runs very well on my macbook and has good graphics compared to the mobile version."
16178,This is the retarded little brother of the real World of Tanks. Wargaming why U port a MOBLIE game to steam? If you like the idea of this or want somehting better than Warthunder (it's tanks SUCKS) then go to google and go to the website and download the REAL desktop World of tanks that's what SHOULD be played. It's free aswell and is made for Computers not phones.
16179,"I've played the app for a few hours before this came out, and I have 1500+ hours, 1940wn8 and 2900 recent wn8 on the actual World of Tanks game.

This game is much more fast pased, and more forgiving. There aren't, to my knowledge, extraneous skill mods like XVM so it's less competitive and you are able to relax more. I was given 1300 gold and 4 days of premium just for starting the game which is a huge boost and makes it easier to play and learn. This game is relaxing compared to WoT and I don't have as much commitment or salt as a result (so it's quite fun to play).

7 v 7 tank combat, unlike any fps around. Tanks have varying levels of penetration, damage, and armor (as well as many more nuances) that change how they are supposed to fight. You need to either kill all 7 enemies or cap their base to win the battle. Battles last on average about 5 minutes, but it could be more or less depending on your team and if people try to camp/hide. There are over 400 tanks in the actual World of Tanks, and Blitz has a couple hundred as well (I'm not sure how varied it is, but there are some differences). You have loads of tank styles to try and it's hard NOT to find something you like to play.

TL;DR: Relaxing and lower skill floor compared to the full/actual World of Tanks game, much less demanding on PC resources, fun 7 v 7 PVP tank shooter. It's free to play so give it a try, THE REALLY FUN TANKS ARE AROUND TIER 5!"
16180,its a nice game but the reload time it takes so long in some tanks or a type of barrel or something like that stuff but is a nice game
16181,"MLG
"
16182,"forwardclank 4 icy me,me,es"
16183,Best ported game from a mobile in a long time... love it and play it all the time. Thank you War Gaming
16184,"Updated review untill tier 5 progress momentally i must say its more fun compared to full world of tanks version, because smaller maps and maybe little faster progress tanks feels more accurate and they dont want money for modules what you research same munition is free. (this review is untill tier 5 on higher tiers are munition for credits but did not tested self if you are in negative numbers after matches and i will update it after i reach that phase) Only problematic part is high tier imbalance tier 4 vs 5 vs 6 vs 7 you are under powered, on some vehicles zero penetration chance, you dont have hp to sustain some shots and nearly zero armor against higher tier, another problem what i found is very bad latency game randomly laging and make your tank rotate on place or drive forward from your cover into enemies"
16185,"If you want a World of Tanks game just download that not this.
"
16186,Trash
16187,Just like mobile but alot sexier( because of very good processor) and alot easier to work then on mobile. One problem though is there is no way of leaving the game when inside the game. So just know how to force quit the game if you planning on jumping in. (also if you have good internet you can get your ping up to 100 since your on computer. For me anyways)
16188,"I play both, and honestly blitz is way more different then WoT, Blitz is more simple and easy to understand to. Many will hate on this and think it's just a knock off from WoT but no it's not. I personally think both are fun and have their own differences."
16189,I would recommend this game to people who can't run the actual world of tanks on their computer. it is a very fun game
16190,good game but very very hard to progress in tanks if you dont spend money
16191,Get the proper world of tanks game if your pc isnt up to par download performance mods to make it run better either way still better than this
16192,World of Tanks fast food.
16193,LOOKS SHIT AND MAP SMALL
16194,BOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16195,"Hell yes.
If you like tanks, fun, shooting, explosions.
This is for you.
"
16196,"An extra derpy version of WoT for potato rigs like my laptop and smartphones. That and NO ARTY!

10/10 would derp around again"
16197,"Do you like World of Tanks but hate Arty ? 
20/10 Never be clicked by sky cancered Again"
16198,"If you've played World of Tanks on the PC, then you'd know the aspects of it that most players despise.
In World of Tanks Blitz:
- There is no arty
- So in turn, games feel more dynamic
- There is +1/-1 matchmaking
- Sixth sense is a free perk that comes with all crew
- For crew skills, no huge ton of grinding to get them because they transfer between crews

Other pros:
- You play against people on their phones, so you get a significant advantage. PCMR
- They have animeme tonks

Cons:
- Graphics are terrible, but they're what you'd expect for mobile games designed for weaker systems
- You can spend gold to research through tanks, unlike in WoT PC where you still need to grind the free-xp.

I'm currently still in the low tiers (tier 6 right now), but it seems like the 7v7 games feel both more team-focused and carry-focused. You can easily sway the outcome of a battle by getting everyone to agree to push through one side. In the chance your entire team dies, you won't have to deal with a 1 vs 15 carry, but a 1 vs 7 carry.

Overall I recommend it if you're a more casual player or if your system can't handle WoT PC. I also do want to say I do actually enjoy this game quite a bit soley because there is no arty. If you're already heavily invested in PC version, enjoy the more competitive aspects, or like the slightly more ""serious"" and ""realistic"" overall tone, you should leave this alone and go play PC."
16199,"I'd rate it 5/7 solid
Anyone who has the potato/toaster pc this ones for you
"
16200,Not a pay to win game
16201,"Release the actual version of World of Tanks on here, damn it!
Apart from that, good game I suppose"
16202,Great game for tank lovers and for people who like blowing up tanks
16203,"when i get frustrated on world of tanks on pc because the matchamaking and team is awful i come on here and seal club with mouse and keyboard against people using cellphones

10/10 would seal club when frustrated 

#babyseallivesmatter 

"
16204,"Can I say its more fun than some other tank games? Because it is. Very recommanded even for a free game. At least I don't have to boot my Windows 10 PC to play the game, now I can play it on Windows 7"
16205,"Compared to PC version :
Pros- Cheaper premium tanks
         +-1 Matchmaking and it works amazing and it feels right and balanced
         No Artillery 
         Way WAYYY better events and specials

Cons - Outrageous graphics,when its on PC update them or something
           7vs7 is small , on tablet its fine but on PC version its not much in my opinion
           Some tanks are changed due to smaller maps and lesser players in a match, but for some reasons Russian tanks      are not changed at all (KV-1 , tier 10 mediums are the same at some even better than PC version) 
           Russian mediums BROKEN and Overpowered
           Russian heavies BROKEN and Overpowered
           Russian TD´s BROKEN and Overpowered because lol BL-10 on tier 8 tank 
           Crew training is *Simple* , WHY THE **** cant i retrain crew in to other tanks ???!!! But the crew skills are WAY more useful i give it that
           EVERYONE is shooting Gold ammo in this game, dont even bother with heavy tanks

In short, if you want to feel competitive in this game,play only the russian line,dont play heavy tanks cause almost everyone is shooting Gold ammo.Fun on Tablets,but dont see a reason to play it on PC.

Do i recommend it ??? - NO
           
"
16206,"As an old wot player,the only things that are good in this game are the no arty thing,the gold u receive at first and buying camos without gold."
16207,Your game is gOod l love you  World of Tanks Blitz
16208,"Cons:
-FoV too low, my head hurts
-Graphics look like an early xbox 360 game but higher fps.
-Can't tell what the resolution is
-Hard to aim for some reason, maybe mouse acceleration?
-This is a mobile port of a game that was already on PC ported back to PC, what the fuck?
-Matches are either you getting destroyed or you destroying other people, every match I played the enemy team either got 1 death or 1 kill
-Other people have said this is cross platform with mobile, so that probably explains the last thing
-Game isn't true fullscreen, it's fullscreen windowed.
-Locked at 60fps I'm pretty sure, I disabled Vsync in Nvidia Control Panel but the lower right corner frame counter is always at 60.
-Fps is like 15 in the garage for some reason.
-More pay to win than World of Tanks, you can actually buy all of the upgrades for the tank instead of just boosting your XP and silver earnings.
-Doesn't have global chat.

Pros: -Reminded me that I want to play World of Tanks, I think that might be a bad thing though.
-No artillery
-Getting into matches is fast.
-I have a really good computer so I'm not sure if it's optimized or not, but it runs well in battles."
16209,Bad game. Not worth your time. The game mechanics are terrible
16210,pretty fun little game it sucks till you get till tier 6 and from there it's funner but untill you get to tier 6 it's a hard knock life
16211,"World of Tanks Light version; if you want to play WoT but your PC can't run it, this one is for you; if your PC can run the real WoT then forget about it.

Again i wished that Stean made avaible a ""mixed"" option."
16212,"Good game, 
not best looking in graphic whay but it's great to play and have some fun.
This game is not intesive in any way so I recommend this and I will give it 8.5/10

"
16213,"No Artillery, +/- 1 matchmaking and 7 vs 7 games that put more emphasis on single players instead of who has the larger mob pushing faster in public games. Regular WOT could learn a thing or two from its mobile version. The only downside are the terrible mobile graphics, the controlls feeling a bit more sticky and gold beeing usable to instantly unlock a complete tank."
16214,"World of Tanks Blitz is like War Thunder or World of Tanks(NO SHIT!) but for lower spec PCs. If you enjoy playing the game without the FPS drops or just want to play a few casual matches of tank on tank action *eyebrow waggles* (definitely not implying you put your gun up a tanks exhaust here. L-Lewd!)  then I would recommend giving the game a try.

I originally had this on my iPad before said iPad started going dodgy, I had to say bye to one of my favourite games. I am glad to see they finally introduced it to PC as well.

UPDATED: After playing this for a while, I can comfortably say that there are a lot of new players that struggle to play the game well. My best advice before even playing this game is looking up tips and tricks on how to play and watch some of the well known youtubers that put time and effort into providing you with reviews of each tank so you can understand how they play and improve your gameplay from the get go.


UPDATE 29/05/2018

So I should probably warn you before I update this that I'm already onto a second glass of whiskey after not even an hour of gameplay. The players in this game have become even larger but this has brought a huge influx of noobs that refuse to learn how to play and ruin the game for those that play this on a competitive level. Their incompetence makes the game unenjoyable at times and they're usually in their prime during holidays, on the weekends and 
after school (Yes kiddos, I'm talking about you).  I cannot stress this enough that these players that have 10000+ games to their name but still play really bad need to educate themselves on how to improve their gameplay and work as a TEAM member, not some yolo swag fag that thinks he can just roll around shooting the ground and win the game"
16215,"It's world of tanks lite edition.
Pros
it's world of tanks 
fast paced 
enjoyable. 
cons
no physics system like normal WoT 
missing stuff form the normal game. 
"
16216,"Some people just dismiss this as being worse than WoT but Blitz does have some advantages and I do enjoy a few odd games of this:

Pros:

 - Games are quicker and more action packed
 -  No arty ( kinda pro ) 
 - You don't lose credits in higher tier tanks ( big plus )
 - Multiplatform game ( your account is carried over to the mobile app )

Cons: 

 - The game feels implified i.e. pennitration chances are marked on tanks
 - Mobile grade graphics
 - Not integrated with the other war gaming titles
 - Currently a smaller selection of tanks than WoT

Overall this game has more of an arcady feel than World of Tanks would. The maps are smaller, games feel less tactical but the games are just quicker overall ideal if you're in a rush and don't have a huge amount of time to stay around for some possible 15minute games."
16217,"World of Tanks: Blitz is a backport of the same game on mobile devices running iOS, Android or Windows 10. It plays great and while it's easy to learn, it is very hard to master. 

I'd say this is a game for those who already have some tanks unlocked in the mobile version and would like to play some WoT on Mac/PC. If you want to pick up a _new_ tank game, this game probably is not for you, you'll be better off trying normal WoT.

The game is not an exact 1-to-1 port from PC. Game rules and the content are a little different:

+1/-1 matchmaking
quick fix games (7 minutes max)
smaller teams (7 vs 7)
plays smooth 60fps even on old PCs

Visuals are a little different, too. WoT: Blitz looks much like older version of WoT, but considering this game was targeted mainly on mobile devices, visuals are excellent for a mobile game.

Progress you make on tablet or phone is synced with PC/Mac, so you can play either on the go, or in your cozy gaming den."
16218,"Small Size of WoT
I like it
-Add more tanks like your real version (WoT)
-Maps
-Make it easy to get silver and experience
-Make cheap tank V to X"
16219,"My number of hours in this game would probably go over 3000 easily if it was released on steam at the release.

WoT Blitz I've played a lot on mobile and Win10 platform and I'm amazed by this game.

It's super smooth, polished and amazingly fun. Battles are shorter and teams are 7v7, which is even better in my opinion than 15v15. Maps are also adapted to the number of players and the battles are overall more entertaining.

Most of negative reviews I've seen here are based on ""why this (mobile) version is released on steam and not the PC version"", which has nothing to do with the quality of the game itself. Game is AAA quality and to question why PC version is not on steam maybe has to do something with Steam taking a not so small chunk of money for each purchase.

For anyone wondering about this game, it's Free 2 play, try it out before you decide.

I'll rate it 9/10. 

FYI game is constantly being updated and new content is being added, what else you can ask from a free game?"
16220,They literally made a worse copy of the origional game...
16221,"Plays like World of Tanks before Wargaming completely ruined it.

It actually matters what you do ingame."
16222,"A mildly entertaining port of an android quick match multiplayer game, nothing amazing but it fills a gap if your just looking for something to play for 5mins.
Dont go looking for depth as the only thing you'll find is how deep it tries to get in your pockets.

Average Joe 5/10"
16223,Play this game until Wargaming make it as bad as they did with the normal World of Tanks.
16224,I love this game. :D

and its free so why not.. 
the original is better tho sad that that aint on steam."

16230,"well i WAS enjoying it until game 4 when i kept experiencing heavy lag and i saw tanks go threw mountains and tanks appear out of no where and ohhh its not good. but i think this is funner than world of tanks ""the first one"" because here its right to the point, really nowhere to hide...the other one ""lots of places to hide"" took to long to level up

well, thanks for letting me try. im heading back to wurm unlimited. ive been working on a house for several days and im dealing with a cotton farm i planted. cant wait to sell off my crops and finish my 2nd level to my house"
16231,terrible game
16232,"Все игры рот WG классные,играю с много закрытого теста больших танков.Ставлю все 1000000000000 оценка."
16233,"TL;DR: a more Arcade version of the original WoT PC
Pros:
-removed SPG, no more sky cancer
-faster, shorter, smaller match (7v7 compares to 15v15)
-only 1 tier difference in match making algorithm
-avaliable on mobile device
-free
-more special promotion or cooperation projects with other titles (GuP, Valkyrie Chronicles, etc)
-better than War Thunder

Cons:
-less free exp than the original, promotes micro transactions
-control is a little bit stiff compares to the original"
16234,"Love the game since i have palyed it on mobile for more than a year. Despite what everyone else says, its nice to have it on Pc it makes it more versatile for me, thats what wargaming had intended to do"
16235,"almost all games from Wargaming are Pay to Win
Premium Tanks are too op, well cause they are for real money
grinding takes ages unless you buy a premium subscribtion which costs alooot
almost anything you wanna do costs you gold
NEVER SUPPORT THESE GREEDY *****"
16236,"the control on the pc for this game is kinda wonky. The aiming is great as you aim with your mouse but the steering could've been smother. 

You'll probably don't notice the wonky steering for heavy tanks. But as the t62a for example. It's really awkward.

But, World of tanks in mini format is never wrong. Fun game."
16237,"This company already created a way better pc version, but they decide to release the phone version on steam. Like why.... why..... just why"
16238,"WTF!?
Why are  are you giving us mobile version of wot , when we can download 1000x better PC version from official site . U dumb."
16239,"Cool game, but sad that they didn't release the normal World of Tanks.

"
16240,"My Intel Celeron 3050U can't handle the regular WoT, but i can play this shity version of WoT at a decent fps rate. So Blitz is the WoT for a gipsy or nigerian guy like myself."
16241,The best game ever
16242,"Like in the mobile version and compared to the game for PC/Xbox or other devices.
It's actually more funnier and simple than the PC version..theoretically.

Also, i hope you guys have a very distinct ear to listen every time you zoom in and out.













That's actually a sound effect from DOOM 95/ II 
[b]RIP AND TEAR!! >:]= [/b]"
16243,"This was originally a mobile port of World of Tanks, now available to play on PC! Many original WoT players may wonder why one would want this game for the PC, considering PC WoT is much bigger and has a lot more content than Blitz. As a veteran of both games, there is a specific niche for both of these games.

 The main plus for Blitz is the fact that you can play on both the PC and your phone, letting you continue your progress from the PC to your phone and vice versa. By the way, you can log in using your WoT account, but none of your tanks will progress from your original WoT account to Blitz. 

Blitz is structured quite differently from PC WoT. There are different mechanics to ammo switching (you do not need to unload your gun to switch ammo, you simply choose and you shoot that ammo automatically) as well as different game modes. 

I find Blitz a lot less stressful than PC WoT, I'm quite a tryhard in WoT but I find that I don't get as frustrated in Blitz as I do in PC WoT. The game is also a lot easier to play than PC WoT, so if you're a veteran of PC WoT you will do very (VERY) well in Blitz."
16244,"= Takes a less serious approach to World of Tanks.
+ The game can be played on PC and switched over to mobile when you are on the go.
+ Can be easily run on most PC's as it's playable on mobile
- Graphics arent as great as regular World of Tanks (It looks more ""Toony"" though that isn't a problem to some people.) 
Would recommend giving it a shot."
16245,"People who complain about this game [i]don't get a point[/i] of its release. It's not World of Tanks on Steam, it is World of Tanks [b]BLITZ[/b], which means it is mobile game released on Steam because mobile players would like to play sometimes on bigger screen than smartphones. If you want real WoT go and download it, its simple, dont complain about this one"
16246,P2W
16247,"Very Nice game, but the menu is pretty bad xd"
16248,Ah man this game is one of the greatest WoT games i've ever played! I didn't like the phone version but this one is awesome!
16249,"only campers and afk people, u will win 1 in 10"
16250,"I've been playing since WoTB first came to Steam. I still love this game. The game is beautiful. There are still good updates, but the game has its pluses as well as cons compared to the old times.

You can play the game. Although p2w looks like it is not exactly like that. There are p2w tanks in the game. I accept this. However, there are tanks in the tank tree that are at least as powerful as them.

Now I will tell you both the pros and cons of the game. Then I'll explain why I vote negative this game.

PLUSES:

-Getting tanks in the game is much easier than in the original WoT. You can get XP and money more easily. The game does not force you to deposit gold all the time.

-You can even become a tier X premium tank without paying any money for the game. In fact, there is a possibility of drop from the weekly free boxes that the game gives you. I have gained both Löwe and AC-IV. You can also earn from events. Sometimes the game even gives the tank itself.

-The game is still fun and constantly evolving. HD skins are now coming to both maps and tanks. It's getting slow though, but HD is coming, including new tanks and maps. That's why old models will eventually all be replaced. It looks like it will take some time.

-The game is really tactical. Knowing the features of the tanks and map knowledge are important.

-Tier matches only differ by 1 level. Therefore, you can play more comfortably in the matches.

-Match times are shorter. A good solution for those who do not have time. It's nice to have 7 vs 7.

-Noob friendly, Easy to learn but hard to master.

CONS:

-MMR is not good. It makes you hate the game. It doesn't make a balanced match. It might seem like it's random.

-Loot Boxes are ruining the game. In the past, it was not so much gambling. Now they sell vehicles in the p2w category that way. Rarely does it come with direct cash purchases, but wargaming does not say when it will come to the game. That's why you mostly miss these offers.

-Prices are expensive. There is no regional pricing. A solution to this situation must be found.

-There are some bugs in the game. Some of these are very annoying. Ghost Shell is one of the best examples of this situation.

-Sometimes there are serious ping and lag problems on the server for unknown reasons.

-RNG is one of the biggest problems of this game. It's there to make the game more exciting, but it's annoying most of the time.

-There is a balance problem between the tanks. Some tanks are overpowered, some tanks are strong, some tanks are average, some tanks are weak and some tanks are useless. There is no balance between the tanks.

CONCLUSION: The game is still fun and you can play it, but I do not support wargaming's selfish and greedy policies. At the same time, the game has many problems, but they still have not solved the problems."
16251,"Many will thrash this game for being a ""mobile port"" and not being graphicaly strong as WoT. However this game is suited for those who hate arty, want +1-1 Match Making instead of the +2-2 in WOT regular, thier computers struggle with WoT regular or want to play with or against freinds/family who have it om mobile.

This game does have it's mobile origins showing when you can use gold to fully upgrade a tank. That pushes the game acrossing the P2W line.

Teams and maps are smaller, 7v7 small short and quick matches.

The game does have special events that WoT regular doesn't get, along with premium tanks no longer seen on WoT regular.

It handels very similar to WoT regular, anyone who's payed that will have a easier time here.

Overall i recommend it, even if you just want to have a look."
16252,"Awfully silly to release this watered down version of an already watered down game. Why not release the original, crappy and grind heavy WoT on Steam? Even if it's a watered down game itself with its infinite death matches and no real purpose other than getting a bigger boomstick, still it's less crapy than Blitz."
16253,"Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone. You progress quite quickly through the game so money doesn't have to be spent unless you're really desperate. However, the biggest problem is the match making. You either smash their team or get smashed. You can be afk on your team and win with maybe one casualty or work your ♥♥♥ off and lose awfully. This can be fixed on future updates but apart from that, it's a solid game. Also, you can run it on a potato so that's always good."
16254,"Worst Pay to Win garbage I've ever seen. Doesn't even attempt to seem fair. People can buy DIRECT upgrades that will make it nearly impossible for someone who doesn't pay to win. If you're not planning on spending a ton of money on a trash ""f2p"", do not play. Second match in and I was grouped with people who I could hardly damage even from behind and they could one shot me back."
16255,"Literally able to buy statistically better items, like ammo and camo. This is a literal rip off in the money sense and stealing from War Thunder. These russians ought to firebomb their own headquarters out of shame. Shame on you."
16256,"While i have only played 30 minutes on the steam version, i have already clocked in a good 70 hours on the original World of Tanks on pc and another 40 or so on the mobile version of World of Tanks Blitz and another 10 on the newly released World of Tanks Blitz on the Windows store. The game is great, it's basically a downscaled and simplified version of the original World of Tanks, it has less tanks than the original, and less maps. it still has micro-transactions in it that is available in most free-to-play games. However, micro-transactions only allow you to progress faster in the tech tree, the further you are on it, the tougher your enemies. The micro-transactions are not pay-to-win

The gameplay isn't very different from the original World of Tanks, only that it's faster, the maps are smaller, and matches generally last less than 5 minutes. a new armor highlighter system has been added for this version of the game, letting players see which parts of the armor are easier to penetrate. this however, may turn off some of the more hardcore players, you must understand however, that World of Tanks Blitz is designed as a casual game, not a heavily competitive one.

progression is somewhat of a grind, where you have to collect xp coins to upgrade your tanks, and to progress in the tech tree. as mentioned earlier, there are less tanks in the Blitz version of the game, however, regular updates every month or so add more tanks and armored vehicles into the game.

graphics is as previously said, the same as the original world of tanks, but downscaled. the textures are not as sharp, and the models are simplified.

overall, it is in my opinion that it's a great game and worth a try for anyone who likes simple and fast tank combat. if the beta is closed on steam but you still want to play this game, you are able to download it on your mobile phone or from the Windows store"
16257,"You know how there's rich people and there are poor people. 
ex : The poor person has to work his way up to a college but a rich person can just buy his way through.

Well welcome to world of tanks"
16258,"I played World Of Tanks PC when my computer used to run it good, now I play this from time to time.

Pros:
- Pretty well optimized, game runs on my 6 year old computer on 60 fps, Runs really good also on my 3 year old phone(60 fps aswell)
- Fast paced, adrenaline full battles
- A pretty good variety of tanks to choose

Cons:
- A pretty toxic community, if you encounter somebody toxic in a battle and it's in your team, you're basically screwed. Either your hiding spot where you camp will get exposed(due to toxic player) or you will get massively reported for not doing what the majority of toxic players want others to do.
- The game is a bit p2w on some stuff, but it's not a big problem depending what tanks you prefer to play as.
- Players are a bit braindead on lower tiers, but when you go higher (ex. tier 3 or higher), it's not a big problem then.

Rating: 8/10"
16259,War Thunder is vastly superior in gameplay and graphics. Go do some realistic and know the real pain of Tiger II's...
16260,"Makes more sence on phone, better with the PC one. Unless you are running a used potato instead of a new one."
