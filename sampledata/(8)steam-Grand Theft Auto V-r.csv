4,Realistic Boobs.
5,i like this game compared to other
6,"An awesome GTA, for sure. Rockstar keeps going another way I would like them to (I am a big fan of GTA 1 and 2, and also Vice City) but it is fine as long as the content they make is worth it: this GTA is totally worth it. It is HUGE, very long, pretty, buzzing with life, indeed all the good stuff you expect from them now is there. However, this is not what makes the quality of this GTA more than, let's say, its predecessor, GTA IV, who also had the content, but lacked the spark. No, GTA V's quality comes from one thing, mostly, this time: the writing. Dialogues are just too good, and make up the difference for the usual, heavy, casual gameplay we got to get used since GTA 3. The amazing life the writers blew into the dialogues between the 3 main characters is awesome, bigger than life, feel like a crazy action movie but so politically incorrect, and I am glad Rockstar can still write things like that nowadays. It is one of the two reasons why I love LOVE GTA 1, along the actualy amazing gameplay, level design etc (the ""game content"") - the burning fire of its style, very outrageous, extravagant, irreverent. Rockstar went back to that style here, and I am thankful as I spent a 100 hours of good fun. If you like that, you should love this game. (Note that I do not care about the multiplayer and online aspects of it)."
7,good
8,good
9,"Ignoring the money-hungry shark cards of GTA Online, this game is amazing. The singleplayer is sadly over-looked as its one of the most excellent parts of this game (with a pretty mediocre post-game to be fair) but the real meat is hanging out with your friends and doing stupid shit. Really enjoyable and worth the time."
10,"GUN: BANG BANG BANG

Me: oh"
11,very cool shoot pew pew
12,"ill say this... for someone who likes the rock star experience, shur its a goo game. but for other people who want a gta 6 game and or some more desired game play i use fiveM"
13,"i like the game but not really because i keep on lagging.

its getting annoying :("
14,God I love games that make me fucking connect to their own launcher online at all times to play something. Fuck off Rockstar
15,I like  lasagna
16,big booty bitches
17,this game funny
18,GOOD
19,nice
20,hi
21,its a great game everybody should play it
22,"gta online is great if you love getting crashed every 5 minutes and getting your ip, address, and all the fun stuff leaked for everyone to see. as of september 2022 theres always a few modders in each session that will love to crash you or ruin your fun by messing with your game and doing stuff like exploding you or make youexit your car and fly around. I forgot to mention the toxic community and godmode glitches. it feels the only way to enjoy this game is to get a mod menu to protect yourself. One last thing is theres so many game breaking glitches that rockstar wont lift a finger to fix, but fix all the fun glitches that dont impact money or anything like that, but i continue to play in this zoo!"
23,Ez money simulator
24,i am seven years old i love the shoe store

38,"epic. The tutorial thing is a little confusing, it could use more instructions. And maybe after you completed the prodigy so you can play GTA online, a title that says CONGRATS! YOU'VE COMPLETED THE PRODIGY, YOU MAY NOW PLAY GTA ONLINE OR CONTINUE IN GTA 5"
39,wonderful game
40,"It's amazing, there is nothing else to say about it. 10/10 Would consider playing if you haven't already."

47,nice
48,"25 years when gta 6
"
49,When I got my first brand new PC last year this was the second I got. It was gifted to me and I love it. Play it every day. There is so many different things to do. Now with all the new upgrades its even better. Being able to sell your items without being in a public lobby is the best thing to ever happen to GTA V
50,all of the contents are nice
51,if your a parent your kid shouldnt play this it shows nudity death etc but if your an adult be warned it shows death and nudity good game few issues but nothing worth a bad review
52,no

125,"Well, where do I start...GTA V is one of the best games of our generation and will be for generations to come. Over the past 8 to 9 years where I've bought this game about 5 times on 5 different consoles, it's always been a quality experience! GTA V is essentially real life simulator where you fly around on motorbikes and shoot rockets at people with laser guns. Me and my friend have completed the Casino heist about 500 times and never get bored of picking up gold or cutting artwork because we do it for the money. 

That's the sad reality of this game and real life, everything we do is for money to live as long as we can before our inevitable demise and eternal darkness for infinity but it's okay since we may have a chance of seeing GTA 6 before we all get nuked by vladimir putinus tutinus. Regardless, I'm going off topic a little, back to GTA 5

There's so much to do in this game and it's still one of the most popular games on the market (after about 9 years so that really says a lot about this games success!) Obviously the game is much better with friends like doing heists or just general missions but it's also pretty chill on your own when you're not being blown up by 12 year olds who steal their parents credit cards to buy shark cards to then buy the Oppressor and blow up all the resources you worked hard to get (solo online lobbies ftw!)

Don't even get me started on the story. I only played it once and that was like 6 years ago so I can't really remember much. I just remember Trevor was the crazy one, Franklin was the thug life one and Michael was the rich one with family issues. The characters were great, the story was great and the ending was tear jerking, a definite 9.5/10.

Overall GTA 5 has been an amazing experience and has been with me throughout most of my teenage years. I've played with many different people and also met some amazing people. I've had so many amazing memories playing this game and it's definitely not over yet. I hope the rest of my GTA 5 experience is amazing and I'm looking forward to doing the casino heist another 500 times <3"

I maxed my driving skill far before anything else with how much driving across the bloody map there is. there is fun content, but it feels like its buried beneath so much bloated design that it's a struggle to shine properly. Hopefully they wont be so focused on micro transactions and said bloat for the next one, but im not holding my breath. Triple a studios been goin downhill for awhile now"

177,Good
178,yuh
179,this is the best game ever
180,"GTA V online used to be amazing when it first launched and everyone was hyped up about it. Nonetheless, the gameplay is no longer intriguing in 2022 given the amount of hackers, which could lead to having YOUR own account banned for no reason. Let alone the intolerable loading time, the game often crashes thanks to those weird players who keep spamming error codes in chat. The current playerbase is just meh. If you prefer open-world coop games, there are lots of other more decent and worth-every-penny options so don't waste your money/time on this."

187,I like the missions on story mode and online has some good ones too but players toxic cus it online
188,game is epic
189,One of the best games I've ever played;It was a great experience for a new gamer.
190,"I'm just gonna strictly talk about GTA Online, as like 95% of the fanbase is for GTA Online. At one point in time, it was arguably the greatest multiplayer experience of all time. There was nothing quite like it. Missions, heists, online events with hectic PVP. Purchasing your own property and vehicles, exploring the rich map with friends, street races that were super fun, but often unbalanced, I'll admit. I met some of the most amazing people on this game and still talk to them to this day. The reason why it's a negative review shouldn't really be a surprise to anyone; it's nothing like it used to be.

Each update became goofier and goofier with a heist about saving Los Santos from an apocalyptic explosion, to having flying bikes and cars. This game practically turned into Saints Row as time moved on. This game, after Red Dead Redemption 2, has the most unbalanced economy thanks to Rockstars milking of Shark Cards that so many suckers bought into only because grinding in this game isn't even worth it anymore. The only decent money method is grinding a pointless heist that really doesn't fit into the game at all. An expansion that the playerbase was SO hyped for, only for it to be some tiny island that's only accessible through yet another boring heist. Not to mention the extremely cringe stereotypes of modern culture only to be portrayed in each update, somehow worse than reality. Nightclubs, biker gangs, kingpins were all forgotten within a matter of months. What they're doing to this game is utterly disgusting and they're really just shitting on their own reputation. I mean, look what they did to Red Dead Online. I shouldn't have to explain what happened there. 

Game is reaching to be a decade old and they support this more than their most recent title only because little dweebs purchase shark cards and give them more and more unnecessary profit. How people are still playing this game is absolutely mind blowing to me."

275,"The Story mode is quite good, even after all these years I sometimes go back to it.
The Online mode is very disjointed but playable, and can be fun with a good crew.
But... the hacking is out of control and Rockstar is completely incompetent at stopping the problems.  Public sessions are utterly unplayable, and instead of fixing the issue Rockstar made Invite Only and Closed Crew sessions that ""in theory"" should stop hackers, but in reality they are a total colander that lets any hacker in, and when they do their goal is to crash your game."

But the only games that come close to this level of detail and story-telling prowess are RDR,  RDR 2, San Andreas and GTA IV. Rockstar remains unsurpassed in the open-world expertise that I crave even as a single player focused gamer. I hope that future games and campaigns continue this tradition even if they have to milk the online whales to fund it."

354,"GTA V (the story mode) is the culmination of all of the series's previous entries's best [i]and worst[/i] elements.

Please, if you value your mental health and your free time, do not waste it on GTA Online. It's often unsafe considering Rockstar's #### cyber-security. Yes, people can find your IP address in-game with basic mod menus, and hackers with malicious intent run through most public servers like its Gotham City on Halloween night.

The ghost of a former Rockstar Games fan has spoken, you can now get off from your knees and leave in peace."

358,"Only talking about the single player. 8/10 at best, which in my book is usually a game worth skipping. The campaign just felt like wasted potential. The characters start off promising but they just end up feeling so samey and none of them develop at all. That's some uninteresting writing. Pretty much nothing happens. They just end up getting into more bad yet uninteresting situations, all to keep the plot moving forward to a lame ass ending. Also there's nothing to do with the money you make besides buying properties that are almost completely useless. Way to ruin any sense of reward. So the story is all there is, and it isn't even good.

I'm done with GTA. The only reason I gave 4 and 5 a shot was because the PS2 trilogy was so good. It feels completely uninspired now. Actually for GTA 6, they should just forget making the single player entirely and focus on the money printing multiplayer loaded with microtransactions to prey upon kids, because I'm sure that's where most of the effort went with this one."

368,"Ok idk how a game that came out in 2013 still manages to be this addictive.
Especially the online aspect. Now I've come to accept that public servers are a toxic space and that rockstar support may be sh**t sometimes but the game in itself is a fun experience, I get to do everything i wouldn't do IRL cuz obviously that would land me in prison. and I get to run my own criminal businesses and become a mastermind. 
Now Onto the story. The plot is intricate, well written and magnificent. Michael, Franklin, and Trevor were well developed throughout the story and NOTHING felt out of place. This is one game i do not see myself deleting AT ALL lmao"

548,"It's a good game overall, but not without flaws, many flaws. First of all story mode is really glitchy after so many years. I guess many things got messed up by GTA Online updates (special skills on all chars getting reseted every time something is relased!) and story mode was just abandoned by it's creators. Typical for all Rockstar games unfortunately... Secondly whole project of the game is tiring and unclear, hard to enojoy it knowing how easy it is to miss something or f something up. For example random events condition us to help people on the street but following this route you can kill important character in the very beginning that you may find important in the end, lol. I ended up in reading wiki before every mission just to not make such mistakes anymore and also to invest money properly so in the endgame I'll be billionaire, not just simple millionaire. But there's another trick - you can't have more than 2.1b$ just because 32bits limits in game developement... Annoying. Last but not least - poor characters. 3 protagonists and it's hard to like any of them, same for all other npcs, everyone in this game seems to be douchebag or psycho. Because of that it's hard to care about the story at all, 0 connection with anyone, not like in previous GTAs. Honestly even speechless Claude from GTA3 had more charisma. Oh, and one more - extremly fast disappearing cars. WTF? Really? You try to change car parked in garage and before you get one out of it another disappears. It's especially annoying connected with the fact that cars you buy in game can be lost forever.
Despite all this mess there are things that make it a good game. Definitely map with all it's details, graphic is on great level even now, 8 years after relase. City feels like living place, you can encounter huge variety of pedestrian behaviors, tons of cars with different mods and colors, nice weather. It's pure pleasure just to drive around, that's why tens of hours I spent just driving a cab around and listening to many radio stations and tracks featured in this title. As this game was on huge promos in the meantime and even on giveaway once - it's worth trying."

562,"There is no point for you to try to transfer your Xbox one account to here. They stopped that since 2016 and honestly i don't even recommend it at all no more. You have to start all over from 0 this game is worthless now. It's no fun no more since RockStar messed up. I only got it because someone wanted to play. The game is outdated. I think it was a waste of my money and time, it pointless now. >,..,<"
563,The game is fun with friends or in solo
564,When VI ?
565,"The single player was fun and mods do make it really fun and beautiful, but the online trully disgusts me for its grindiness and monetization, I would not recommend getting into it unless you already have friends who want to play with you as it can be very frustrating/addicting for some people."

GTA V gave me a good gaming experiance, and i don't mean that lightly. It gave me the same feel goods as RDR2 at the end, execpt with none of the main characters dying. This is a great game, give it the time of day."
587,awesome
588,I drink sea water yees!
589,"I didn't even want to play this game because it is SO not me, but my boyfriend talked me into it and since you guys were having a sale on it I bought it and I have to admit it's been a lot of fun.  So many things you can do in the game it's worth it and I definitely recommend people to try it out."
590,i play nad it take real life away
591,the more i play the more i want gta 6

Otherwise gta5 is a great game, just feels like a bait and switch with the ""bundle""."
631,Really Fun but requires a lot of friends.

748,"I have more than 1300 hours on this game ( EPIC STORE ). Finished the story and have level 286 in GTA Online. Safe to say, this is a really interesting game, possibly the best open world online experience ever possible. It is ""definitely best"" but not ""perfect"". There is a lot to be improved but for what it's worth, this is the one to be played. You can do Heists, cruise around city in expensive cars, play deathmatches, crazy stunt races, visit your friends' house, have a chill time, do business missions etc etc. Even after 1300 hours there is so much more for me to explore. The bad thing I would say is : since the game heavily depends on micro-transactions ( in-game currency ), the online experience is very grindy. You need to put in many many hours to establish some passive income and become self-sufficient. But, thats the actual fun in this game. I guarantee this, if any player will hack or purchase currency and get everything, the game will become very boring. There will be nothing to put effort for. This is like ""living in the moment"" game, you enjoy doing chores in the game, either alone or with friends. But, I'd say with friends this game becomes much much more fun, alone is efficient but gets boring really quickly. Rest assured story mode is also pretty fun if online is not your thing.

9/10 from me and only purchase it on sale (game is almost decade old now)"

763,"I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently downloaded Multiversus and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Grinded a lot, bought 1 shark card, built all thee businesses, started Cayo. I did not cheat or mod. Never griefed. If someone was killing me for no reason I would just change the session.

After all that I still got permanently banned. What sucks is there's nothing I can do to change that.I contacted the Rockstar support and they are no help. They just give an auto generated message.

I am very disappointed after waiting for so long to play this game"

In the film, a washed up silent film actress and her butler kidnap a broke screenwriter and force him to do anything the actress asks because she is actually mentally ill and her life depends on feeling loved by everyone, despite the fact that everyone finds her insufferable. 

That's the Public Lobby experience. Only difference is you can now do all your CEO work in Private Sessions, so you don't end up like poor Joe Gillis while Norma Desmond is flying around the map on an Oppressor MK2."

Don't bother playing unless if you've got higher end specs otherwise you'll be frustrated, they've done maybe 2-3 QoL updates and bug fixes over fucking YEARS and BILLIONS of dollars in shark cards Rockstar made, so extremely doubtful I'll reinstall until I see a big update addressing some of the issues the community and people like me have always harped on about."

883,"Online is filled with nothing but hackers and cheaters. There's more hackers in the online mode than Red Dead Redemption 2 and that's saying something. It's incredibly disappointing and a disaster. For online play, you have to modify your game by downloading a third party program and proceed to sign an application just to be a pending spot on a list with other people waiting to  be approved to play on a secure, role-play server or deal with the hackers.

I recommend the third option, get a console for this game so you won't deal with hackers spawning clown cars in your home and killing you with explosions."
884,First GTA ive played.  It is enjoyable but somewhat annoying at times.  Wish text messages would stay active and not leave when you get offline.  There are little quality of life things that could be fixed.  This game is not going to get anymore support but i hope GTA 6 will listen to the feedback that they got with this game so that the next one can be that much better.

Was the best one from a technical perspective so far in my eyes.  Story-wise and gameplay wise, I feel like they've had a hard time striking the same feel as GTA3 or Vice City had.  I wish they had more silly missions like pizza delivery on a Fagio and RC car bombs."

1099,"I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."""

1348,"Singleplayer experience: great.
Multiplayer experience: awful. Not because people online sometimes keep killing you or because there is hackers (there will always be hackers in every game ever), the awful part is the loading and crashing. I have a really good laptop that has more than good enough specs to play this game. My wifi is also pretty good, so if I have to wait for 10 minutes for the mission to start, it is not a ""groundbreaking online game experience"". Also the fact that, many times, missions would end, load for 15 minutes (not exaggerated) and then I would get no money from the mission what so ever. Missions crash at random times, I tried finishing a mission with someone 5 times and it would always say we ""Failed"". Just an example: we were robbing a casino, we came to the vault, it said we had about 2 and a half minutes to steal as much as we could. The timer hits about 2 minutes and 12 seconds left to steal, game says ""Failed to steal in time"". Another example: we were trying to do a mission and we were on our way to a building. We both approached the yellow marker and there was a 2 minute loading screen. When it finally loaded I was stuck outside the building, I couldn't walk away, I couldn't enter the building, I couldn't run, equip guns, or get inside a vehicle. These are just two of many many examples of the really sad cases of my experience on gta 5 online. For such a big company and for a game that is so focused on multiplayer and is said to be ""one of the best games ever"" it is extremely sad and disappointing. If you are buying the game, buy it because of singleplayer."

Devs don't care about the game or the player experience, they're just busy milking it for money as much as they possibly can.

1430,"I had been putting off this game for ages and I finally bought it a week ago. I always thought that GTA 4 was the best and that no GTA game could ever come close to beating it. I WAS WRONG . GTA 5 blew my expectations with a strong storyline, complex believable character (who for the most part were so good that you rooted for them ), and a robust gameplay loop. Liberty City can't even compete to Los Santos; its size and it's complexity. I don't play GTA online a lot so I can't say anything on that but it's always full of people. Buy this game, you would be doing yourself a favor."

1460,"Quite simply, there is no other game like it, and I have been a long time fan of the GTA series since the DOS version. Once GTA evolved into 3D in grand theft auto 3 it was another mile stone in this game defining series. GTA 3 Being native to consoles at the time introduced ""normies"" or mainstream gamers to this one of a kind type of game. While working as an electronic game retail worker in the 2000's, after the underground sucess of GTA 3 (and at the same time) the rise of broadband internet, I rember saying: ""When they implement online elements to this game, (i.e. playing with your friends) IMO it has the potential to be the best selling game of all time. It is rare for me to guess correctly about video game industry trend predictions. If you buy one game on steam, buy this if you have never played GTA before."

1593,"If you thought this was a review of Grand Theft Auto V, you are entirely wrong, This is a guide on how to make Methamphetamine at home here are the steps: 

List of chemicals and materials:
Diluted HCl ‚Äì also called Muriatic acid ‚Äì can be obtained from hardware stores, in the pool section

NaOH ‚Äì also called lye.

Ethyl Ether ‚Äì aka Diethyl Ether ‚Äì Et-0-Et ‚Äì can be obtained from engine starting fluid, usually from a large supermarket. Look for one that says ‚Äúhigh ethyl ether content‚Äù, such as Prestone

Ephedrine The cottons in today‚Äôs vicks nasle inhalers don‚Äôt contain efed or pfed (ephedrine or psuedoephedrinE) but there are still lots of easy ways to get good ephed or pfed, pure ephedrine can be extracted out of it‚Äôs plant matter, from a plant that can be bought at most garden stores. Or you can get pfed from de-congestive pills like sudafed. Most people prefer to work with pfed from pills rather then ephed from the plant. The important thing is that you must have pure pfed/ephed as any contaminants will fuck up the molar ratio leaving you with over-reduced shit or under-reduced shit. Or contaminates will jell during baseifying and gak up your product which will then be very hard to clean. So you want to find a pill that is nearly pure pfed hcl, or as close to pure as you can get. Also check the label on your pills and see what inactive ingredients they contain. Inactive ingredients are things like binders and flavors. These you don‚Äôt want and will remove when cleaning your pills. but certain inactive ingredients are harder to remove then others. You don‚Äôt want pills with a red coating, you don‚Äôt want pills with alot of cellose in them and you don‚Äôt want pills with much wax. you also don‚Äôt want pills that contain povidone. As a rule, if you have a two pills that contain the same amount of pfed HCL then take the smaller sized pill because it obviously has less binders and inactive ingredients, time released pills are usually harder to work with because they have more binders and tend to gel up during the a/b stage. Also only buy pills that have pfed HCL as the only active ingredient. You first have to make ephedrine (which is sometimes sold as meth by itself):If you are selling it‚Ä¶I would just make ephedrine and say it‚Äôs meth.

Distilled water ‚Äì it‚Äôs really cheap, so you have no reason to use the nasty stuff from the tap. Do things right.

List of equipment :
A glass eyedropper

Three small glass bottles with lids (approx. 3 oz., but not important)one should be marked at 1.5oz, use tape on the outside to mark it (you might want to label it as ether). One should be clear (and it can‚Äôt be the marked one).

A Pyrex dish (the meatloaf one is suggested)

A glass quart jar

Sharp scissors

Clean rubber gloves

Coffee filters

A measuring cup

Measuring spoons

Preparing your Lab:

Preparing Ethyl Ether:
WARNING: Ethyl Ether is very flammable and is heavier than air. Do not use ethyl ether near flame or non-sparkless motors. It is also an anaesthetic and can cause respiratory collapse if you inhale too much.

Take the unmarked small bottle and spray starter fluid in it until it looks half-full. Then fill the rest of the way with water, cap the bottle and shake for 5 minutes. Let it sit for a minute or two, and tap the side to try and separate the clear upper layer. Then, draw off the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, and throw away the lower (water) and cloudy layer. Place the ether in the marked container. Repeat this until you have about 1.5 oz. of ether. Put the cap on it, and put it in the freezer if you can. Rinse the other bottle and let it stand.

Ethyl ether is very pungent. Even a small evaporated amount is quite noticeable.

Ephedrine & or P-Ephedrine:

5. Pour 1/8 teaspoon of the lye crystals into the bottle of ephedrine and agitate. Do this carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air, avoid any flames as usual. Repeat this step until the mixture remains cloudy. This step neutralizes the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluble free base (l-desoxyephedrine) again. Why do we do this? So that we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities. For 3 oz. bottles, this should take only 3 repetitions or so.

6. Fill the bottle from step 5 up the rest of the way with ethyl ether. Cap the bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes. It is very important to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible. This will cause the free base to dissolve into the ether (it -is- soluble in ether).

7. Let the mixture settle. There will be a middle layer that is very thick. Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thin as possible. This is why this bottle should be clear.

8. Remove the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, being careful not to get any of the middle layer in it. Place the removed ether layer into a third bottle.

9. Add to the third bottle enough water to fill it half-way and about 5 drops of muriatic acid. Cap it. Shake the bottle for 2 minutes. When it settles, remove the top layer and throw it away. The free base has now been bonded to the HCl again, forming a water soluble salt. This time, we‚Äôre getting rid of ether-soluble impurities. Make sure to get rid of all the ether before going to step 11!

10. If there is anything left from step 3, repeat the procedure with it.

11. Evaporate the solution in the Pyrex dish on low heat. You can do this on the stove or nuke it in the microwave (be careful of splashing), but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater (like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the remaining crystals will be ephedrine HCl.

If you microwave it, I suggest no more than 5-10s at one time. If it starts ‚Äúpopping‚Äù, that means you have too little liquid left to microwave. You can put it under a bright (100W) lamp instead. Microwaving can result in uneven heating, anyway.

First Batch: 120mg ephedrine HCl Estimated: 300mg (100% of theoretical, disregarding HCl)

Now, Making Methamphetamine out of ephedrine by reducing it with Hydroiodic Acid and Red Phosphorus.

Items needed:
Alot of matchbooks (the kind with the striking pad)

Coffee filters (or filter paper)

Something that measures ml and grams

A flask (a small pot with a lid can be used)

iodine"

1664,"Only for the online version.
Pros:
-Even after almost 10 years GTAV still the definitive open world experience, no doubt.
-Tons of customization for cars and your character.
-Great amount of missions and stuff to do.
-Good atmosphere.

Cons:
-Very grindy.
-P2W game.
-Toxic community.
-Tons of cheaters using mod menus.
-Still not very optimized.
-Very unbalanced.

After playing for almost 10 years since release i finally accept the fact that Rockstar just doesn't care enough about its PC version or simply its just too big for them to handle. Even after the recent updates (which have been great) its still pretty noticeable the degrading state of most servers due to cheaters still having a heavy presence in the community, which in the end, it just ruins the whole experience."

1690,"STEAM DECK SCORE: 4.5/5

Compatibility layer: ProtonGE

Gameplay: 5/5 - I thoroughly enjoy playing this game. Especially with friends. The fact it is a console game as well as PC makes analog stick compatiblity a breeze. you can aim accurately using the sticks, touchpads. there's not even need for Gyro. Recent updates to the game itself allow for you to perform Business actions in Online on invite-only servers, allowing you to keep script kiddies at bay. Genuinely fun to build your criminal enterprise and run heists with friends. And the singleplayuer campaign is nothing to laugh at either.

Graphics: 4.5-5 It is 2 console generations odl by now. but it still looks AMAZING, especially at 800p on a 7"" screen. The small test is actually quite easy to read on the Deck screen.

Audio: 5/5 - I admit I use ""Self Radio"" a lot becuase of my strange tastes in music.  All the voice acting, car nosies, gun noises are all very satisfying.

Conclusion:This game feels like it is desigend from the ground up for Steam Deck. It owes this to being designed from the ground up for consoles, but that is not a shortcoming with the fun factor. Absolutely recommended.I don't recommend buying Shark cards or the CEO pack if you can avoid it. the game is MUCH MORE FUN if you work from the ground up to earn your ingame money."

No matter how man times I have promised to play for 1 hour only, time just flies by while I am cruising thru the roads of Los Santos while listening to some fake ass chatter radio.

1786,"Its a great game whether it is story mode or online mode GTA 5 is one of the best of all time, boasting great soundtrack, story line and game play mechanics, its hard to get bored of this game because of the amount of activities you can do, online mode is great with friends and with the people you meet, heists are fun, racing feels like its the midnight club all over again, the only downside is the case of cheaters ruining the fun for most of the players, online mode should not be moddable and could have been a separate file, there are also balancing issues in terms of vehicles strength most vehicles look like they can tank a bit more explosives but they can't for some reason and aren't really worth the price, overall its a an amazing game 11/10 would recommend."
1787,"The Origin of Purple Guy

In 1976 William had twins: a little blonde girl and a little brunette boy. He started to teach Michael to take care of them, because ""Daddy won't be around forever"".

During his free time, William started designing and projecting new robots (he hated the name ""animatronics"") and plans for his own company: Afton Robotics. But he had another plan under his sleeve: ruin FFP from the inside.

He disguised himself as Dave Miller and started working applied for day time security guard at FFP. As he was always wearing purple - the uniform's colour - and usually hid in the shadows to stay out of sight of anyone who might recognize him, he was nicknamed by every child as ""The Purple Guy"".

During this time, in 1980, he did his evil plan: using the Spring Bonnie suit he built years earlier, he lured five children to a back room, murdered them and hid inside the body of the animatronics. In case you're wondering what he did with the fifth one, he obviously hid it inside a spare Freddy suit he then painted yellow, duh.

Fortunately for Billy, they actually caught Henry instead of him, as one of the cameras caught him walking around in one of the suits. He got out sometime later, as they managed to prove he had some mental disabilities and had a fixation with wearing the suits around, and had no violent behaviour.
But Dave? Well, he was fired when FFP closed.

Circus Baby

With the help of the money he got from selling the children's organs in the black market, William opened Afton Robotics and had everything ready to open his own kid-friendly restaurant: Circus Baby's Pizza World. The problem is that he got a new hobby, and this where his hill went down.

He liked so much the idea of killing children and the profit he could get from selling their organs - healthy children organs are way more valuable than adults' -, he made special alterations in his robots, turning them into kid-kidnapping and killing machines.

The problem is that, in 1982, he accidently let his daughter get close to Baby when he wasn't looking; and Baby killed her. He knew he was the one to blame, but he actually blamed Michael for this, saying that he, as the older brother, should've protected her.

This incident lead to the pizzeria's cancellation and William's divorce. His wife took Michael and the other boy with her, leaving him alone. His new hobby and this incident in his life lead him to become a human monster."
1788,"Who the fuck is andrew tate? I‚Äôm so sick of being left out of the joke. Who is this fucker? Is this just one big goof on me? Is he even real? Who the fuck is andrew taint?

And more importantly, if he is real, why does he have a bugatti up his ass? What did this guy do to make the entire internet hate him? Did he make an edgy joke? That‚Äôs probably it. He probably said ‚Äútraps are gay‚Äù on twitter and hurt your wittle feewings.

Seriously who the fuck is he? I get really irritated every time I see a post about him. Just the other day my dad said ‚Äúandrew tate bugatti booty‚Äù and I fucking lost it.

1820,Dogshit broken game.
1821,"So I have to respect what it says ""on the tin"" - it is basically fast and furious- in a world hyper-polorized it is nice to have a no fs given type of game HOWEVER. 

When I play a game again and again and cant desire to complete it - that is a bad sign. I relized the only things polished in this game is the graphics and the online purchasing.  Both of these things work like a charm but everything else is a mess. 

If you play online or single player their will be moments when it loads for what seems like forever. For a game that has the assembly of realism - I think the mechanics are screwy. When I play a Saints Row I know its a facimily but GTA convinces you it tries to be realistic but first person is ridiculious to master- controlers are bulked and the key pad has some inventive key bindings that could crash any game experience... dont even try to modify things you will break more than you fix. 

Air- planes have 2 pitches and thats the key right their..... redudency. Every single thing is copied in triplicate - guns and cars - controls and environment. Every time you try something new it might as well be a new experience. The amount of times i said to myself "" remember it was that way in this curcumstance but not right now"" was baffling. Swimming is a joke- Ive never seen a more broke thing. Many of these things can be fixed but its not a Farcry driving sequence its major game things that change requiring eagle reflexes to remember. Ive played many games and the amount of times when ORIGINALITY was required here is stupid. EVEN Ravenfield didnt re-invent the wheel. 

I want to love this game. Its ballsy- its loud- but everything is put together backwards. The slow burn of the story is far more dragging than having to restart a game that doesnt allow skippable 10 minute cutsceans. The characters are charming in a phycopathic way but I have no clue as to why they do the things they do. Having a character who didnt know of something have everything ready for you when you arrive so he can get revenge and turn a martyr out of his enemy was stupid beyond compair. The amount of times single player chacters do something that could have been awesome but did not lent me to the idea that the world of gtaV needs to be blown up. 

Multi-player is maddening. With little competion they probably feel secure. However these is no excuse- you should sort griefers from PVP from people who just want to hang out with friends. Everyone usually tries everything eventually but lumping them all together sends a bad message. This isnt sea of theives its not built to mix the differing ideas together. In the past ive lost 100,000s because I was shot before a passive activation was counted. The Guns however are even worse. They dont lie but Ive found most of their stats are usless. Since everything in this game is a ""like"" and not really like true life... you have no Idea if something behaves like it does in real. A short stop AK is more deadly than a custom one even though its stats are worse? Racing it gets real bad but the stats are mostly accurate just throw out any comparisions to real life or games. The matchmaking is bulked and anyone can interupt and while I dont know how they break into a ""closed"" game I do know I dont want greifers. Ive tried on 3 seperate occations to try this game over at least some years apart. Every time IM PUNISHED. 

It wouldnt be so bad but my social is not reading me but if I click purchase something the shark card is up before I can blink. This game does not get credit for being made before the ""pay to play"" craze. 

Im mostly making this review in the vain hope that somone on GTA V relizes their will be no VI because nothing in politics has changed. The only hope is to fix this game and keep it going because as Ive said- Its kinda the only car and gun game around. I can understand banning mods when your fleecing us of all our money but their is no excuse for bad load times.- Glitches and the abundance of hackers who seemingly delight in their aparent relization the world must die... {wonder where they think they could go if they get their goal.- lol} 

As Ive written this review Ive relized many mistakes in grammer but Id like to keep it up. The real test of greatness is understanding a person's message no matter how rough. I feel I wont change anyone's oppinion but surly they would have thought of matchmaking corrals and faster servers.... as for single player either you like battlefront 2 the new one grind feasts or you already know you can handle a few bugs on pc and have bought Cyberpunk 2077 { I dont give into hype so i didnt have an issue. A few T poses but no grining my gears}- even in the future it makes more since than this simulation. Ill probably still play now and then for friends but Ive a ton of hours on Payday 2 and I imagine that I will still out-pace this game from onward this moment. 

If you like fast and furious and dont mind everything being jankey, laggy, and bug ridden its perfect. If you dont care about cars- play Payday 2 - If you dont like multiplayer - Cyberpunk 2077. 

rant over- hope this helps"
1822,I have not tried the story mode but if you have a group of friends that play GTA its a really fun experience! I have heard tons of good stuff about story mode so ill probably try it out soon!
1823,yes
1824,So I have 49 hours into the game as of posting and I'm only 60% completed with story. The amount of content in this game is insane especially for the price when it's on sale. I highly recommend this game. The game has so much life in the modding community that it's worth it beyond just the story mode content.

I had been crashed shortly after starting up the game and was stuck in an infinite loading screen after completing the first half of stealing supplies. so if you are gonna play GTA 5. please I beg of you. play it on console.
1914,ITS SOOOO FUNNY AND COOL

"
1932,"So much content online and offline there are nearly as many possibilities as in real life, you wanna have a normal job driving a taxi? you can do that. wanna rob a liquor store? you can do that. wanna be some mute tiny blond man that kills cats , kicks puppies and shoots deer while engulfing the land in hellfire? then have fun go for it! (this game does get some pretty step discounts every now and then so if the price is too much (which its not, trust me) then just wait till the summer sale or something!"

1955,One of the best games ever made and will always be the game that made me want to game. The game makes a lot of insanely hilarious and not serious comments on society and that is my favourite part. There is so much freedom in this game. Just play it.

1977,"very nice gamiming experience

"
1978,"This game is a complete let down from GTA San Andreas, the story is boring, the car mechanics are shit, you have to drive the car to extremely long distance to do minute stuff, there are mission choices which is wierd, there is a skip option in case if you are stuck which makes the game boring, most of the game is really simple, there is no interaction with other people, you can't eat or go to gym, there are no gangs that you can control, San Andreas is a masterpiece but this one is just one time play only."

1988,GG
1989,you cant play more than a minute before running into this games myriad of game bugs. good luck trying to get anything done when every lobby has a modder. dont waste your time in this game WoW is better in every way and even tho its older it is way  higher in quality than this game will ever be.
1990,Very fun game if you are a masochist
1991,as a GTA fan this game was amazing like im playing since the start but i did not had the online experience but now that i have there is many problems that rockstar must fix like cheaters.bugs. character freezing in heists and the loading screens that take so long like 30 min even 1 hour but its a fun game anyway i like it but as i said it has some problem
1992,NOICE
1993,"NICE GAME I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH
"
1994,"One of the best games I have ever played, endless missions and jobs,  interesting heists etc. Highly recommend buying this game!"
1995,Thank you for inspiring me to start my own criminal empire.
1996,"So basically let's jump forward to the GTA ONLINE instead. The story mode is completely plotless, rob that rob this, heist this heist that, kill this kill that... 

Alright, this game been released for almost 7 years on PC, the company doesn't seem to care about the cheaters in-game. Cheaters ability is getting stronger day by day like mutation of a virus xD
Mail blasting you for cheat menu promotions... Spam chinese fonts in the lobby [Even I'm a chinese too], If you ever play in the asia server. God you wouldn't believe this, don't ever put your name as john, jack whatever. If that chinese mf is a racist guy, he will instantly pop infront of you either grief u with his mod menu or put you to sleep :) [Shut down your game]

So anyone who read this , I suggest you should buy other games to play. With this game price you can afford two fun games instead of this. For parents/cousins/friends/lovers who wanted to buy this game as a gift... don't. There's better option than this trashcan :)"

Online is fun and has a lot of content, BUT!!! Rockstar does not prevent any cheating apparantly. You will find at least 1 hacker with god mode or something equally ridiculous in every full game session. And half of all load screens just blackens the screen and lets you wait until you eventually find out that you need to close down and re-launch the game. Absolutely ridonculous, considering Rockstar is making lots of money from people purchasing online currency. The amount of game breaking bullshit in online is UNACCEPTABLE Rockstar! And since they keep creating content, its baffling that they don't fix some of these major issues."

One will not be bored here because of its massive content from Hollywood, Downtown LA, LAX, UCLA, Staples Center, and even Napa Valley. It is now up to the player how he or she wants to live the life in this beautiful city.

The Criminal Enterprise DLC is absolutely worth it if one buys it during a Steam Sale, for those who are wondering."

2306,"Review on GTA:Online only:

Been playing since 2015, but took a couple years break.
Returned because I've heard of the recent QoL update - You can now do 99% of the previously online exclusive events, in private / invite-only / friends-only session. Modders? Hackers? Cheaters? Griefers? Not a problem, at all, anymore.

And now that I've returned to GTA:O after my year long hiatus, the passion, the fun, the excitement were reignited.
GTA:O is like a theme park, it's got a little bit of something for almost everyone. And the enjoyment only multiplies if you've got someone to share that experience with.

The more friends you can drag on in this adventure, the merrier it'll be.
But the GTA:O is definitely a lot more bare bone if you're playing it like a singleplayer game, however even basing that experience, GTA5:Premium Edition of a CDN$14.80 is well worth the price."
2307,its very gege

2559,"fuck rockstar, please just make a new game. no exaggeration when I say it feels soulless to play now, and is a supreme cash grab, hackers are actually still everywhere, and it genuinely makes me not want to buy whatever they plan to make in the future out of spite of not letting any company let such potential go to waste. GTAV is good in principal, but Rockstar is horrible."

2576,"This game has alot of content for the price, the single player story alone is worth the price, there is so much to do and all the characters have so much personality. 
And the online part of its also very good, just as long as you have friends to play with. You can totally play alone but much of the new content is almost impossible alone, like the gunrunning dlc, the online part is a grind but it can be very rewarding.
And yea there is alot of griefers online but you can ignore them easily by selecting passive mode or just creating a private session.
I def recommend this game just bring some friends, and if you don't have any well, find a community, there's alot of them out there."

2632,"A strict downgrade from Grand Theft Auto 4. The combination of lack of building interiors, worse physics, collision detection, vehicle damage modeling system, pedestrian behavior scripts, and AI makes for a less immersive game with inferior world building. The story itself is a slog to get through so it is absolutely critical for free roam to take up the slack but unfortunately the game just falls apart on that front."

2648,"Buggy online play. You may not receive any money for doing jobs. Certain high value heists can bug out, kick you out as the CEO and you auto fail, multiple times in a row until you talk to support about it. Jobs give you shit for money. Property that allows you to obtain good income costs millions and a constant upkeep cost. Online play if you need to make money is only good with friends or solo. Playing with the general community and trying to make money will only burn your time for nothing to see for it.

Hackers galore online that destroy everyone in their wake. You can unload an entire 100rd m4 drum mag into their head and....nothing. To think Rockstar actually tries to make people buy in-game currency with this sort of shit going on is ludicrous. The only part that is worth it is the single player. Too bad it is has to have a live upload from rockstar game servers and takes forever to load even for single player. The single player campaign is fun and entertaining but not worth the money they ask. I prefer San Andreas."

2666,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

Hell they talk about their mods through the online game chat. Get mods yourself, otherwise you will just lose everything and they will grief til you leave the game. But otherwise. its a good game.

2726,"Worth it, a very good game, however please make sure you have a good enough computer to run this game so you don't have to play it on PS2 graphics."
2727,Best Game to Play Even when you are alone and it never gets you fell like you are bored
2728,"best game ever
"
2729,"Not into racing games. I thought there would be a little more to it but it's more into the racing aspect of this game than it is anything else from what I can tell. I only use the handheld controller when playing a football game other than that I use keyboard and mouse. Driving a vehicle using the keyboard is almost impossible for me. 

Keyboard is way too touchy I tried adjusting it and there is no adjustment when you touch that key you turn quickly it's nothing like the mafia games I'm playing the driving in those games are really much more easier than this game. I will probably never play this game again it's not a game for me. I honestly feel this game is overrated. 2.1 hours in and that's probably all I'll put into this game. 

The developers putting a lot of time into this game and I don't know why when you have red dead online which will blow this game out of the water. I'm sure the game is fun for those who like to do fast-paced racing and I'm just not one of them not at all. Take the cars out of the game and put horses in and you'd have a good game. Hoot"
2730,Great game apart from the modders
2731,nice game
2732,I had REPEATED account issues within the 2hrs I have owned this. Refunded.

2761,"With over 300 hrs of playtime I can say GTA V is a great game IF, you play LSPDFR or a ROLEPLAY. The story mode is fun and all but this is steam. Anything and everything can be moded some way shape or form. I recommend buying this if your interested in that type of gaming style. If your new to pc gaming then playing lspdfr is a must, newbie roleplayer can really learn the ropes of mods, and serious roleplay groups that you see online."
2762,peepee el caca in el caca land
2763,GTA V is fun and enjoyable the driving is fun the story is good and the online heists are fun the only downside is the random people online with flying bike that obliterate your ass with missiles
2764,"gta v is a game of which it has had it's udders milked to the point where they look like pink wheat thins, its obviously a dry game which needs a new installment to it's series but most people including me keep coming back to it cause rockstar pushes updates every few months that contain a dripfeed longer than the universe's time span

buy this game its definitely an essential for any gamer but it's fun will only last you 2.3 nanoseconds since its 2022 and you will get absolutely fucking pulverized by a –±–∞–±–∞ —è–≥–∞ cosplayer on his flying broomstick"

         -additive gameplay loop.
         -fun character customization.
         -story mode runs pretty well.
Cons: -awful overall story, too many plot-holes.
          -over priced items in online store.
          -outdated gun play.
          -limited weapon customization and unbalanced combat.
          -online is not optimized.
          -beware when playing online in public sessions, some players can see your personal information.
          -no cross-save or character transfers."

I would just drive around knowing that's all I could do without someone flying around killing me every time I did something with ESP, AIMBOT, ETC. I would HIGHLY recommend NOT playing this game."
2832,Game
2833,"Cool game, recommend this game!"
2834,piece of shit game that cant even run properly on literally any hardware. rockstar also went a took any fun out of the game by locking it all in the online version. you know what you can do with all that money at the end of the game????? nothing. absolutely nothing because all the cool shit is only in the online mode which is also trash that is filled with 12 years olds running around with mommy and daddies credit card buying shark cards to pay to win. if you dont use the in game vsync the menu will hang and almost freeze every time you pull it up including the map.....again no matter what your specs are. i wanted to shoot all the side characters any time they were on screen or talking.....just an absolute dumpsterfire of a game

3012,"Start GTA V in 2022, Buy at least $200 worth of Shark Cards, purchase an Agency, Nightclub, Arcade, Penthouse, other shit, and all guns at once. 
Go achievement hunting, finish your heist series from Fleeca bank to Cayo Perico. Own a Bunker and start killing MFs and then get targeted and called bounties on, be confronted by a hacker, get forcefully Ddossed and Money drop to where you are vulnerable to getting your account banned for cheating. 
Everything back to normal since you start staying in private Solo/Friend/Crew lobbies.

Buy a Auto Shop get a bunch of tuner/muscle cars with the money the hacker gave you, start doing car deliveries, finally you find dopamine on how great GTA Online has developed since you aren't able to play GTA Online in Old Gen consoles, and then...

The game is filled with modders, and with the accessibility of free mod menus, every 12 year old and all their friends are in god mode griefing every session.  You literally cannot find a session online that doesn't have at least 2 or 3 modders.  The differences between console and PC are pretty vast.  On console every session is basically all out war with everyone killing everyone... on PC it seems to be kind of frowned upon, but you can still find a fight here and there.  Mostly just people cargo grinding, or screwing around modding sessions.  It is amazing that this game after all these years is still almost as relevant today as it was in what, 2013?  Still a fun game and you can do many many things from hitting up the Casino, racing, cruising around in free mode, grinding cargo, heists, etc.  You can even enjoy a game of golf or tennis."

3054,"Ok on steam i have over 300 hours, but i cant tell you how many more i have on my console. so well over 500 hours total. The campaign alone is worth buying the game, its a little bit slow at first, but it has such a great story and all in all a good game. The Multiplayer on the other hand not so much. If you have friends to play it with it is great, you can do heists together and missions, races, so many things. the multiplayer has so much to offer. But if you are playing by yourself, its hard to find randoms that are willing to help with heists or heist prep so theres not much to do. plus even with or without friends there are lots of griefers, and lots of hackers, so be wary. The campaign alone is worth the money, but if you have friends to play this with multiplayer is great. BTW FYI, this game is not cross compatible. you can only play with other pc users, no consoles."

Ook is de schoenenwinkel een culinair hoogstandje, je moet er eens een kijkje nemen voor high-end sneakers. Kortom genieten geblazen!"

3085,Fantastic Game 10/10 : 100% (WOULD NOT PLAY) non non just kidding play this game then make your own gang a pull a drive-by on them ops
3086,"My online experience:
After years of playing and loving this game, I have finally quit. The game in its current state is unplayable. In every single lobby there are modders that are trying to ruin your experience. In the past you could start a solo lobby with the task manager and only 3 to 4 players would eventually join. Now at least 1 of those 3 to 4 players is either modding or griefing. There is no longer any fun to be found in trying to play the game. The updates have made the game more favorable for griefers because of all the new ways to kill your fellow players and Rockstar is still not taking on the modders.

Advice for new players:
New people shouldn't consider playing online. I tried getting a friend to play the game, but she ended up get griefed so much because of her low level that it was near unplayable for her. You can play minigames and races, but that is all.

Advice for returning players:
If you like griefing there is definitely some fun to had for you in this game, but you need to already have some money to buy the stuff you need to do so, because it will be hard to get the money because of all the griefers.

If you like doing missions and heists I would suggest to find another game, because there will be a lot of players trying to stop you from finishing the setups. It is possible, but you will face a lot of modders and griefers so it will take up a large amount of time.

If you like doing races and minigames with friends, then you should definitely still consider playing this games. The minigames are great and the races are still enjoyable. There are not a lot of good new minigames but old classics like sumo are still very enjoyable."
3087,"Fix game please it is impossible for me to play this piece of ass game because it doesn't even make sense for me to play it. How can a person make a game with the shittiest movement/ aircraft/ motorbike/ cars controls and the game will still make money for them. I click W the player with turn around 8 times, pray to god and el rubio for a ruby crystal before actually going straight. I will try and fly a plane and the plane will randomly turn off its engine because I clicked 'A' for it to move left because the planes in this game are so stupid that they will randomly turn left or right on their own so I had to make myself new controls for the aircrafts for me to even know how to ride the shity plane to cayo perico so that then I can die by the guards there because I failed some shity fingerprint card hacking because the game is so shit that it makes it by racism for the fingerprint to be rng-ed to make it the most confusing hack known to man. Overall, shity game, wouldn't recommend to anyone because of how shit is has been made by the known company 'ROCKSTAR' XDDD rock- star ... they can't even make a good name it's just like naming my son WATERPHONE"

3095,Recently tried to come back to the GTA online but it is not what i expected. the new criminal update seems to have made the game way more unstable. long loading screens and several blackscreen lockouts trying to load into either the casino or hidden base bunker. I have spent a literal hour of time just waiting behind loading screens and not playing any of the missions or games. When it finishes loading i get bombarded wiith completions of things found and caches unlocked which greatly boosts early game levels but its not fun just sitting and waiting. Just cant recommend at this time

3220,Grand Theft Auto Five is a Fun Game for you and all your friends however its a bit of a grind and Kind of hard for new players unless you buy the Platinum Which give you a starting business and a Few million dollars which sounds like a lot but its not for modern GTA Online. The GTA Online is probably the only thing you will do with friends you could play the story mode however it is pretty much all done by others and there won't be anything new if you played on Xbox 360 or PS3 Back in the day. If you want to play a fun game with your friends this definable will fill the time if you like Guns or Cars. If you don't like these then your probably best buying some other game for you and your pals.

3301,"Singleplayer is AMAZING! online is destroyed by constant cheaters and modders. walls of text infesting the chat window advertising cheat accts' and discord spots for money. Roughly every 20-30 minutes a modder will join the lobby, kill everyone, then kick the entire lobby. After, you'll spend 5-7 minutes trying to join Rockstar Janky servers and link up with friends. If you start with a fresh account in Online good luck avoiding the die hard players with late game gear griefing everyone. there's fun to be had but in a limited capacity. find something else to play and avoid this over monitized trash."

3309,"This game is similar to my toenail clipping, hard to get into, but taste extremely good."
3310,old game whens new one coming?
3311,****DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE INTENDING TO PLAY ONLINE.**** Rockstar lets hackers and modders roam freely in public games to terrorize anyone and everyone. If that wasnt enough you will get spammed by the hundreds of sales bots trying to steal your info with scams. GET FOR SINGLE PLAYER ONLY
3312,i am insane
3313,"I have just completed single-player and this is what I wanna say.
In the technical sense this game is great. A lot of attention to details, great graphics.
In terms of the plot the game is kind of lame in my opinion, especially compared to GTA SA.
But overall I think the game is fine."

3322,gud game
3323,"It's a GTA title - what more can you expect?

The mechanic of being able to shuffle through three characters and see how the story unfolds from their PoV is something I've always liked about this game. The story is decent - nothing I would rant and rave about, but the satisfying ending and all the things you can do in between make it an easy game to play and enjoy."
3324,wonderfull game ever
3325,Very entertaining game i highly recommend it
3326,Won't recommend if your playing online. Modders can come into game sessions do money exploits and causes you to get banned. So anything you bought like shark cards can also cause a ban. Not worth the time or money I put into this game. Frankly rockstar is a waste. Will be uninstalling
3327,I'm so glad I got to play the R.E.A.L. VR mod before the DMCA takedown! This game is legendary and it's even better in VR. Rockstar are a bunch of clowns for what they did though. I won't be surprised if this ends up being peak GTA. Especially the part about blowing up the head of Lifeinvader just to do some insider trading. I loved that part :)

When you start it is much harder, but as you learn certain mechanics and glitches, it's a very good game. I think it would be nice to have a setting to disable nudity, and for people who don't like all the yelling, maybe no curses as a setting. Overall the game is great."

3531,Was a good game back its day. However it appears that in 2022 absolutely ZERO effort is getting put into bug fixing and with every new update that this fossil of a game receives it becomes more and more unstable and frustrating. I have loved this game for close to half of my life at this point and to see it being treated this way is heart breaking. It is readily apparent that the purpose of GTA V at this stage in its life is nothing more than to sell shark cards. A feature that even still is becoming more and more irrelevant due to the game not working long enough a good chunk of the time to actually USE any of the stuff that you purchased. Rockstar prioritized this game over Red Dead 2 online and allowed a brand new game to totally flop. And still this is the state that game is in.
3532,ITS GTA ITS GOT THE STUFF I COULD NEVER IMAGINE ANOTHER GAME MORE HOTT

3580,"Fun game... Just like it was almost 10 years ago. The single player campaign is still a very fun experience. The Online is another story. While jam packed with content and loads of things to collect and activities for every play style.. It is PLAGUED with hackers that overall ruin the fun. They are avoidable through invite only sessions but that defeats the purpose when you want to play with others. Also on top of everything I believe that the price on shark cards is outrageous considering the age of the game.

All in all Id say if you've never played GTA V give it a go! In my honest opinion though if you have purchased this game on a past platform and played it before its just not worth it anymore.

GTA 6 Online finna be blockchain based with some shitcoin as the currency"
3606,"STEP 1
Cut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.

STEP 2
Fill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.

STEP 3
Remove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.

STEP 4
While you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.

STEP 5
Using a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.

STEP 6
Chop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.

STEP 7
Break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You‚Äôll know it‚Äôs ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you‚Äôre there.

STEP 8
Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.

STEP 9
Hold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.

STEP 10
Gently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don‚Äôt want to overdo this mixing.

STEP 11
Finally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they‚Äôre dotted throughout.

STEP 12
Pour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.

STEP 13
Put in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it‚Äôs not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.

STEP 14
Leave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you‚Äôre using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you‚Äôre using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.

STEP 15
They‚Äôll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.

In other words its a good game."

Dislikes - HACKERS, MODDERS completely ruin it all for online. There is nothing more frustrating that some jerk taking over your car while you are driving it down the freeway, or not even being able to get completely loaded only to see explosions killing your character and there is not PC or NPC near you. Rockstar, you really need to get a handle on this. Try rented servers instead of instances like GPortal does with Conan."

3709,"I recommend it for its free-play and customization. Otherwise, the game has become a micro-transaction nightmare. It's a good game in a lot of ways, from fun and challenging missions to tons of open world activities. The story is awesome. The multiplayer... is what you'd expect. Spotty, and you get an interesting mix of toxic and nice players. Hackers are beginning to become more frequent too. The game is pretty old now but still going strong. It's a huge grind. It's good, but not as good as the older games in my opinion. From my experience, you can sink 150 hrs into the game easy, and still find things to do. Where I am now, though I think the game is tapped out after 300 hrs, just my thought on it, though.

After all is said, I'd give an 8/10"

3733,"To start off, GTA V is a good game. It might not have the best storyline we‚Äôve seen from the series, but it is a very well-crafted and enjoyable experience. The map and atmosphere of Los Santos are unmatched by anything on the market, there is truly no competition. However, the singleplayer part of the game has not been updated since 2015, with all of the content being added to online instead. And Online is very different to GTA V, and the reason for why this review is a negative one. To start off; it‚Äôs simply silly. In a game about street crime and taking scores R* has decided adding content such as flying jet powered bikes w/heat-seeking missiles is appropriate. The reason for such additions and departure from an experience that remains a little more grounded is simple, it‚Äôs money. At this point GTA Online only exists for the purpose of extracting as much monetary value from children (or rather, their parents) as possible. Putting aside how unethical this is, it makes for a much worse end product. That being said, it can still be enjoyable at times, simply because it is built upon the foundations of GTA V, the map and atmosphere is still there, and on PC where players tend to be a little more mature than on console you can usually end up in peaceful sessions away from R*‚Äôs bullshit additions. However, even if you do enjoy online, the downright non-existent security opens up more problems. This is because R* has made no attempt at making their software safe to use. First of all, flaws within the Social Club application make it so that you can be tracked across the game by people who exploit them, and since servers are peer-to-peer this means an external party can have complete control over your experience; they can straight up make it impossible for you to join online, effectively banning you, and there‚Äôs nothing R* can do about it. And this is the least of the problems associated with R*‚Äôs peer-to-peer system, since not only does it make hacking in the game incredibly easy and pretty much impossible to prevent (not like R* has made any attempts at stopping hackers mind you), it also means that anybody can see your IP address, giving this software the potential to doxx your rough location. Long story short; Grand Theft Auto Online is an exploitative mess that R* has not even attempted to make safe for us to use."

3859,"Have had this game forever.. single player is awesome. Online.. well, it has potential, and can be a pretty good time. Anymore though, any given session you are bound to run into menu modding, griefing and a general toxic environment. Rockstar does nothing to stop this unless it has to do with money drops. If it's a money drop, they're all over that, because it messes with their shark card sales.. beyond that though, they don't care. Good if you do single player. Online play is not recommended unless you have a group of friends to play in an invite only session."

3864,"One of the Best game i have ever played whether it is it's graphics, gameplay, physics, etc. Storyline is also too exciting and Online multiplayer is like jam on bread. I would really recommend this game to whosoever is in search of a exciting open world game. People sometime are in confusion of what game they should buy while they have the budget, so i could say they have many option like Far cry franchise or NFS franchise or Forza Horizon, etc. but this one could be the combination of all of them like shooting, racing, competition, etc.
So go ahead don't lag behind while you the time!"

3991,"An amazing game thats addictive but i cant give it a highscore because of the amount of hacking and cheating and use of Godmode online in multiplayer. Rockstar seems to not care about the cheating but took the time to nerf the MK2 but compeltely ignored the fact that every other online player is using the Godmode exploit which ruins the game for everybody now that nearly every online player is using the Godmode exploit. I know this is PC but this is just too much hacking going on. players can teleport themselves teleport you, instantly make you explode, instantly dismount you from your vehicle, put you in a cage,send you to the island, freeze your character so they cant move, they can take all your weapons away or they can simply just kill you with jets of randomly spraying water which comes up out of the ground, or fire even if you block them. 

I do not recommend this game on PC for these reasons. Play it on console its complete trash on PC. its the wild west and the hackers and cheaters have taken over this game on PC."

4001,"We are our own worst enemies when it comes to GTA.

Pros,

Best campaign in the series.
Voice acting is on point.
Graphically has always been stunning.
The map is diverse.
So many vehicles and options to customise them.
Buying properties and starting businesses is a cool concept.
Amazing gunplay.
Large amount of weapons.
Many easter eggs and the urge to explore everywhere.
Minigames gallore.
Amazing characters and side characters.
Unique character swapping system.
Alive world where NPC's have random encounters frequently.
Stock market in single player.
Amazing mod support.
Engaging and fun online missions.
Heists.
Over 20 radio stations packed with popular music.

Cons,

Online public lobbies are the most toxic place in online gaming.
Pay to Win.
Shark cards.
Playing without purchasing shark cards is a long and tedius grind.
No single player DLC which is a massive tragedy after GTA4.
Game misses the health notification from previous GTA games when shooting somebody.
Mission timers if you take too long.
Car customisation is overly expensive.
Oppresser.
Business running is pointless without the upgrades.
Loading screens.

Look.

It isn't perfect.

And it WASN'T bad.

But we as a community destroyed this game, I have thousands of hours on console but recently purchased on PC to play with another friend. 

The community are the reason there is not a GTA6 yet, Youtubers and streamers, shark cards and hackers.

All part of the problem.

Why would Rockstar make another GTA rapidly when GTA5 is still one of the biggest cash cows even 9 years on?

Supporters can blame complex development and blah blah blah.

But the reality is that Rockstar are going to squeeze every last droplet of money out of this game before they even show a trailer for VI.

We all joke about Skyrim but I think GTA is a far worse business practice considering the MTX.

TLDR.

Do not buy this for online unless you have at least one friend.

If you are for single player then you will enjoy the greatest of what Rockstar USED to do with their GTA games.

It can be fun online.

But sometimes it feels like a job."

4008,"GTA V is a great game with great story, great gameplay and great possibilities to spend your time.
I can recommend the singleplayer a lot, 
however the online mode is corrupted with flying and shooting motorcycles, 
other unrealistic vehicles, repitive missions and extensions, exaggerated prices forcing you to play the same heist 100 times just for a simple car.
I miss the times when GTA online was just as realstic as the casual game and the ingame content was more affordable.

As I said I recommend the singeplayer. Have a great day"

4013,"For a game that's from 2013, it is still good and somewhat holds up to today's standards. Although the story mode isn't as good as Gta IV or SA, it is still enjoyable. The online portion of this game is very active to this day, although, its fan base is very toxic, e.g: constantly griefing newer players, modding and using godmode and such; but you can do pretty much everything you do in a public session, in an invite only session (since u can sell products due to the new DLC update). I still play this game although not the story mode as there's basically nothing you can do there. Overall a good game."

go to console if anything,even then slightly less sketchy things going on 

online public lobbies= digital cancer   example no protection from modders even in private sessions, no support From R* even states   you will NOT be updated on support or reports etc haha
modders are untouchable  and they are everywhere..minimum 7 obvious ones per session, dont need to find them  they will find you, they can smell you,,they quite literally know where you live-enjoy that one 

more advertising than youtube 
more in game spam than a 90's email account
more repetition than tiktok short loopy thats why-

online security?
  public privacy?
anti cheat?
NNOOOPPEEE  enjoy being chased across Lobbies by 1 inch of fury players
your account banned from R* because a modder that idolises R* IMPOTENT RAGE character took special interest in you-  BIG FAT TICK in that box 
 
TLDR:  EA wants there Dunce Crown back from R*...the kings of TRASH have been conquered
ALL HAIL R* as the new KINGS of TRASH
"
4067,"I love this game and I would definitely recommend the single player. But online it's just a whole different can of worms. Rockstar has some SERIOUS security issues in online, like modders being able to leak your ip and being able to spam racial slurs while being blowing you up. Also the player base has some issues with people who have a 660 kd ratio in a oppressor mk2 coming to destroy your cargo. So many of the things in the game are so expensive it feels like selling your soul to buy a simple and a nice car. Not to mention how there is so many connection issues and server issues this game has. This game is HEAVILY pay-2-win, why grind and have a sense of achievement when you can bust out your disappointed mother's credit card to get easy cash? I hate the pay-2-win nature because it stops Rockstar from trying and making something innovative, original and not stale. The product of Rockstar not trying was the gta definite edition. Rockstar didn't care, they just expected a studio that does mobile ports of games could handle such a massive project.

 (next few lines are going to be related to rd2 online and Rockstar) The whole thing Rockstar did with rd2 online was honestly just sad. They made the actual fun ways to actually make money (bounty hunter) literally lose you money with all the expenses calculated with the payout. The jobs actually paid you more for taking more time in the mission, so you can just wait out the sheriff's office to get a higher payout. 

Sorry for any typos and not refining this review, this is my 3rd review on steam and I would love to hear you constructive criticism."

4093,"Modders, yeah yeah, but if you can look past them, it's a really fun game. The way to make money is incredibly slow, but if you buy a car or motorcycle for cheap, you can do tricks for fun. Also, running people over is pretty epic. The cops are balanced in my opinion, even if they are a little bit dumb for some scenarios. What I wish is if you could control the police difficulty. It would be fun to crank it to max and try to escape with some friends. By that I mean, instantly make yourself 5 star wanted. Regardless, if you are on the fence or want to wait for GTA VI, just buy it. I'm sure this is what Rockstar wants, but just buy the damn game. (Tony)"

4136,Too much bugs in gta 5 online like facilities missions and you can't end the missions because of some bugs and they dont repair this bugs for 4 year and too many moders hackers and greifers
4137,The online is full of hackers. I haven't entered one activity that didn't have a hacker and rockstar doesn't do anything.
4138,"After 279 hours i have come to the conclusion that my real life is no longer needed, why make money in real life when i can shit my pants in my parents basement and blow up level 3 players with a motor cycle with rocket launchers. i have been cumming for hours on end because i watched PRB and we are getting married on sunday"
4139,"While Grand Theft Auto V is a fine game on it's own, it's ruined by the existence of GTA Online. The story holds up even to this day, but the same cannot be said about online play. What started as a simple racing, deathmatch, and mission mode with your friends became and absolute solo grindfest. The economy is in ruin, where a single supercar will cost you hundreds of dollars in microtransactions, of tens of hours in grinding. The issue only gets worse when you consider the existence of griefers and modders, as well as the piss poor performance of the game itself and the security of peer-to-peer. As someone who's spend well over 800 hours in the online mode itself on PC after exhausting all story mode content, I cannot recommend this game in 2022 unless you've never seen it's story."

4151,"A walking simulator set in a fusion of a fantasy Los Angeles, Canon City, Fontana, Bullhead City and other places.

You can ride bike.  You can drive cars.  You can drive motorcycles.  There are aircraft and boats.

You can pretend to a criminal and set up various criminal enterprises and schemes.

You can be cannon fodder for anyone who has more time /played than you unless you find all the menus and learn how not to be cannon fodder.

You can shoot a gun or two.

You can get chased by cops or the army or other players.

Once you have enough unlocked it is time for you to determine if you are going to stay or go.

Staying means either learning to hunt other players or collecting outfits, vehicles and firearms that you didn't need to use to get to this point.

Going means you have fond memories of being here in either case.  If you are gonna go, don't stay so long as to ruin it for yourself."

4351,"I don't recommend this game on PC, buy it on console, but do not buy it on here. It's extremely unsafe. I had an hacker leak the approximate location of where I live just because some random player said I'm modding the game, which could of been harmful to the people in my house. On top of that it's filled with toxic people who just really ruin your mood while playing. It's also filled with griefers who will non stop kill or attack you just to get a reaction from you. It's filled to the brim with hackers who again, could actually do some harm with the hacks they have and put your life in danger. Rockstar does nothing about them at all either, they only care about the money filling their pockets and not the player base."
4352,Here I am playing it over 10 years later so they must have done something right but like can yall just release the new one God D

4535,"Doesn't have the character or charm of any of the old games, and it takes up 3x the hard drive space of the other biggest games in my library, and it's still a vastly empty, open world with almost nothing to do. This game exists for multiplayer, which is pretty much a cash grab on Rockstar's part, but it certainly doesn't have anything all that unique to offer either."

4569,"Rockstar essentially creates a sewage system for everybody's money that now feeds into a septic tank large enough to be classified as an island nation, the cash flow now threatens the earth's tectonic plates and threatens geological disasters as the amount of money they've made on this shambles of an experience that hasn't improved an ounce since it's original release could destabilize our earth's crust, down to the mantle and then the core. The state this game is in after being top of the sales charts for 5 years, surviving 3 console generations at this point and earning more money THEN THE ENTIRE FRANCHISE HISTORY OF STAR WARS with a massive development team behind it and a constant player base is beyond shameful but in reality is shameless because it's Rockstar, the perfect encapsulation of the games industry as a whole."

4596,"What can I say, it's GTA?

Despite my hours, I have never actually touched the single player portion of the game outside the required tutorial -- all of my time has been spent enjoying GTA Online.
This should give any prospective customer a good idea of just how much game they'll receive for their dollar, here.

The campaign in GTAV takes a fresh approach to the protagonist -- allowing the player to switch, at their leaisure, between 3 different scumbags with 3 different lives.  It's fun way to tell the story, and works well for approaching the multi-tiered narrative these titles have been famous for, as you get different firsthand perspectives on events and circumstances.

It's great fun, and I highly recommend it for both single & multiplayer open-world afficienados."

"
4611,lamar says bad word
4612,"TL;DR

ok so to start with lets talk about the game the story telling is what you would expect from rockstar games. but unlike its siblings this episode of GTA allows the players to take on the roles of 3 antagonists.  
franklin tailed consistently by the idiot known as lamar. micheal desanta retired bank robber and struggleing to control his family and Trevor phillipes the very embodiment of a phsycopath trailed closely by wade an unfortunate but idiotic person and the more disguisting ron. as you play each micheal franklin and trevor you begin to learn a great deal about their pasts but ultimatly your led down a extra violent path leaveing chaos and destruction in your wake. in relation to story telling the game fullfills this very well but once you've completed it once it like red dead redemtion 2 pointless going through the story again unless you intend to make different decisions. but there isn't really any way to improve on the story

then you have obviously the online element. you play as your own custom made character (and yes you are mentioned in the story. since for awhile up until the ill gotten gains part 2 update online events occured before the story mode and then as the ceo warehouses came into play events of online occured after the story mode. 
the updates for the online of gta was great and fun to play but due to modders hackers and the likes things got gradually more and more expensive. which is fine. in any event you have alot to do from warehouses to stealing top end cars to gun running drugs sales nightclub oownership many heists and more 

now theres the GTA5+ subscription service, you are in no way obligated to  subscribe to the service as its more aimed toward helping new players  and it is utterly useless to veteran players who already have alot of money or at the very least have a bussiness that you rely on to make money with. from recent discussions only other reason to have it is for the rarest loot in the casino hiest the diamonds. 

thankfully now since the last dlc release everything is playable in invite only sessions removing the need to force solo public lobbies when playing ceo biker bunker and nightclub businesses. you may not get a bonus for the sale but most people are happy to give-up that bonus so long as we get to source and sell in peace. this is somthing the gta online community has been asking rockstar to do for years and they finally listened and gave us what we wanted. in general the update might not have been as big as the agency doomsday heist general heists businesses or others like it but that one change was more then enough to make us all happy.   but it didn't exactly address all of our issues but it is enough to satisfy us for now.

unfortunatly there has been abit of a dark cloud or controversy surrounding rockstar in the last year. 
where does this come from none other then red dead online. many feel that rdro is being severely neglected. but i am able to see things from both sides of this coin. having played both. 
honestly has rdro been neglected it certainly seems that way, rumors have it that rdro was merely a testing grounds for future gta titles and future gta online content but be that as it may truth is rdro has formed a following of devoted players and they feel left out because gta online still recives sizable updates. is it seriously lacking. atm yes it is but rdro is only on year 3 it seems to be following the same path gtao took for the most part for the first 3 years there was a lul in the size of content as in the first 3 years of gta only really saw small dlcs until the heists released after that updates got bigger and better. will rdro follow this i don't know. i can uinderstand rdos feelings the game is a good game and has potential but they have to understand to when all is said and done gta is their golden child.

sorry for the long review"

It's buggy, it's slow, it's filled with griefers, and there are so many complications and steps and tutorials you have to complete just to play a simple mission with your friends. That is if your friends can connect at all. 

Maybe I'm just stupid but, I do not recommend buying this game only for the multiplayer. Buy it for the campaign."

4645,"For single player, a great game to play through once. Story was good, missions were fun, sound and graphics are top notch and what you'd expect. 

Sadly, after that there is nothing left. The world feels completely dead. Unlike past GTA games, there are hardly any repeatable missions. There's no replayability. Instead, it appears they want to you to play the online mode for that. I'm sure you can already imagine how that goes. Yeah, no thanks.

Good game for a single play through. A disappointment compared to past GTA games in my opinion."

Online can be really fun, mainly when playing with the bros, but if you are by yourself, its not worth it, the grind alone to get money is insane, and only made doable by exploiting the cayo perico heist. Overall I would recommend this game for the story mode, but be weary of online"

4741,"Grand Theft Auto V - A 100% Review

Gta V, an action adventure game developed by the greatest devlopers of our life time. Rockstar is a company version of Quentin Tarantino. The story is so raw and real that we didn't ask for the insanity that is trevor, but we would be shameful to not appreciate and applaud them for making such great characters. The Story as much as a I love it, is dated, but is still a story that every gamer knows about none the less. This video game came out in 2013, a true neoclassical beauty. 

Story - The single player story mode lacks character development, Franklin after he gets his house. stays the same, Trevor, never changes, Micheal never changes, he thinks about his choices when he talks to his shrink but thats about it. That being said, the charisma, action, comedy, crude, porn things that happen in this game are SPECTACLUAR. The gameplay mechanics, graphics, and action packed missions and side content are somthing truly one of a kind. 

Story 8.5-9/10

Gta V Online - CANCER. but just like real cancer their is somthing beautiful about this game. the constant updates, content, hiests, cars, weapons, missions, events, collabs, music, PVP, fun, companys, bussiness etc etc, its amazing. This game on current gen and even next gen consoles is almost borderline UNPLAYABLE. but on PC what a joy ride. not being capped at 30 frames or even 60 and enjoying a good smooth 80-120 is just amazing. 

THE FLYING CANCER MARK II is what ruined  GTA V online, and now that is no longer a threat due to the constant updates and work by the dev team. SLOW but they got there. 

Online 8/10

All in all a solid game, that has a lot to offer and much like all of rockstar games, a must play 8/10"

4854,"My only problem with this game is that it does not teach you how to play it. Like, at all. There's an entire keyboard of bound keys for functions of menus and sub menus and layers of interactions. It's like looking at that psycho map of conspiracies in that TV show, but there's no guide on how to use it. If that's a deal breaker, then this game isn't for you. They did a LOT of things right though, smooth game play, nice collision, graphics aren't going to burn your PC down on potato settings, fantastic dialogue so far, and incredible diversity of activity."

4989,I would only reccomend this game if you dont happen to be in lobbies with multiple modders. They ruin the entire games experience and are in about %50 of the lobbies. They will Kill you over and over or destroy anything you are doing. Its a serious problem but it will never get fixed. Its fun otherwise but you will get it ruined multiple times by modders.

Single player was a good time. GTA Online is hit or miss. The amount of people cheating is 6 out 10 people in a lobby. Some missions also require 4 people. This is bad if you don't have friends to play with. Randoms will troll or disconnect causing failed missions. You have to pay in-game money to play missions and buy ammo.

Game looks good. Has mods. Cars are fun to drive. NPC react in funny ways. The game got free dlc throughout its life. Some missions are fun. 7/10 overall."

5031,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

5153,"GTA V is great, pushing players into the ""online"" version is a troll move and the online version is broken. Mission to steal a car from a cargo plane, but you cant drive or walk onto the cargo plane due to invisible barriers. Leave mission? Now you're labeled a ""bad sport"" because you've left a mission that's so broken nobody can complete it. Played story mode, great, after a few  hours of ""GTA online"" uninstalled."

5165,"The absolute worst Multiplayer game I ever had.
I dont get it why this game is this famous and successful.

-Multible load times over 3 Mins on M.2 SSD (we live in 2022)
-Bugs which crash the game
-MP timeouts after 1-2 Mins
-Hackers on every 2-3 Gamelobby
-Flying motocycles with auto rocketlauncher hunt ppl without any reason. U die and can get killed again after 15 secs of respawn, and they see u on the map to track u down. Did i mentioned the LASERMINIGUNS?
-Driving simulator to get to the mission locations
-Outworld user interface with no sense of practical usecases

I really tried to give this game chances...more than 5 times, ""maybe it get gets better"". NONE"

In all this game is worse than getting your balls stapled to a trash compactor filled with bullet ants and thousands of used heroin needles"

5215,"Online is marginally worth it if you get the game on sale cheap, but...

I can only really recommend it if you have some friends playing it already or to play it with, or really are fine with a lot of grinding solo.

The true online portion still suffers from cheating and remains mostly intolerable unless you want to spend a large amount of your time switching lobbies around to find one without someone cheating.

The single player meanwhile is quite bad. I'll try to explain it without providing any serious story spoilers.

The protagonists could have been interesting and I genuinely do like all three, yet none individually really get enough time to be fully explored or fleshed out, and the mission structure can feel schizophrenic due to sometimes forced switching and plot threads being dropped or picked up between protagonists.

Missions also pay few and far between early on, and a story theme seems to be characters ripping you off or not paying up, forcing you to basically earn money through dry stock market play on the few that do pay, or simply bum rush your way through half the story if you want to start buying much of anything.

One should not be stuck sitting around with the wiki, inevitably spoiling the story, to figure out which stock market stuff to invest in on all three protagonists before you even start a mission just to get some sort of reward out of early missions.

The later story often trips over itself with too much perspective swapping and picking up or dropping of plot threads, but failing to devote enough time to any specific thread to give it real impact, or to devote any time to meaningful interaction between the protagonists that could have built more on them.

Some of us are in this for the journey, not the destination, and this game purely messed that up compared to previous entries in my opinion. Not because of three protagonists being a bad idea, or the story being bad in concept, but because of shoddy execution.

As for side missions, many are unrewarding/disrespectful of time investment, or fail to respect player skill.

An example of unrewarding is a chain of tow truck missions that reward you no money on completion, but at the end of the chain allow you to purchase the towing company, which costs $200k, just so you can grind radiant tow truck missions that pay $500 each. A really terrible deal if there ever was one.

An example of disrespecting player skill is one involving a parachute jump leading in to a race against a character, where even though I landed a full 40 seconds before he did, I was forced to wait on him before starting the lame bike race where his AI practically cheated. A better game would have allowed me to have that 40 seconds lead from my skilled jump and landing as a head start in the race portion. Instead it wasted my time and made me wait around.

Previous entries from my memory just let you murder annoying ""optional"" characters like the above and basically opt out of their content and additionally get rid of their marker on your map to keep it ""clean"". I do not see why that freedom was removed given that the save system easily rectifies any accidents here.

Cars you have in single player are stored in a garage that you have to manually wander off to to pick up. While that was fine in the older single protagonist titles, there is little point buying the protagonists here other vehicles or customizing or storing things outside of their default due the fact that on switching, doing something on another one, and switching back, they will basically always be back in their default vehicle and might be literal miles away from their garage.

An ability to set your default would have been nice, or to call the mechanic and have one brought to you similar to how Online handles it. Instead due to the lack of that, you're mostly just going to have to come to terms with the default vehicle of each character.

The customization of the three protagonists can also feel rather lacking. Due to all three having rather set lifestyles and personalities they of course have styles and preferences they lean to. While I am personally okay with that, it can feel a bit limited and previous titles had a bit more flexibility while keeping the personality of their lead intact.

As for the game in general, expect a lot of unpolished elements such as clunky UI and genuinely horrible mouse and keyboard controls. It can get to the point of feeling like no matter what you are doing, your character and inputs simply are doing something else, acting unresponsive, or acting overly responsive to the point of wondering if your hardware is broken. 

The flight controls are also exceedingly bad and require an almost immediate remap, when a lot of other PC titles or ports have managed to get this right that were made prior to this game. Even when remapped however, expect them to at best be awkward and somewhat twitchy.

To have good controls when flying, you are stuck sitting around with a controller like a console peasant, when this is a PC release. That should not be a thing.

On other elements, the police are borderline psychic at times and will notice it when you shoot a lone pedestrian way off in the wilderness with a silenced weapon, during a thunderstorm, at night. At other times meanwhile I can, on crowded, open street in broad, clear daylight, simply blast someone with a shotgun with zero consequences. It feels like there is no real rhyme or reason to when what happens when it comes to how police in the game behave.

The wanted levels also take a rather long time to fade, and while one might argue ""realism"", it just ends up a time gate or annoying having to stand 100m off of some road waiting for it to go away.

Add to this that having any form of flying vehicle makes escaping any wanted level a complete joke, with me and a friend having successfully escaped 5 stars in a blimp. Flying reduces cops to a time gate to wait out before you get your mission way-point back, and makes this less ""GTA"" and more ""Flight Simulator"".

Even the original San Andreas had jets come after you eventually if you tried to escape by air, and it managed that balance of ""Cops respond to things"" and ""Cops can be escaped with some but not excessive effort"" better than this game does.

Other AI behavior can be just as rubbish or inconsistent, with them sometimes instantly headshotting you from 50m away with a shotgun on opening a door, or shooting you with laser accuracy through tiny slits in vehicle armor during chaotic high speed chases, and other times simply accepting death as you shoot them like a defenseless watermelon, or trying to take cover behind nonsensical objects like a parking meter or small tripod telescope when something far more suitable is a single step away.

Traffic meanwhile seems even more aggressive or intent on hitting the player at times than previous titles. While rockstar seems to find this ""funny"", it really isn't and loses any ""haha wow random"" charm it might have after the 30th time it happens. This is generally a trend that needs to die in rockstar titles.

As a final glaring problem, the game, like other rockstar titles of the generation, loves it's animations way too much.

Most times when I get killed it's not because of combat being ""hard"",  but because of almost instant, and endlessly, respawning enemies appearing within firing range while my character is taking their sweet time opening a door, carefully getting in to a vehicle, then needing to mess around to start said vehicle, all while being shot. I have literally no input or control over this while it happens, or way to speed it up.

That's not endearing. It's just annoying. While I respect ""realism"", it shouldn't come at the cost of game play and some contextual speed ups in what is being done, or just the ability to abort out of an animation to deal with a situation at hand would have been nice."

 Takes 2-5 mins to log into the game, sometimes you wait 5 mins and then you get disconected. Œíy far the longest loading times, even ps1 games load faster.

There are moders and cheaters everywhere too. Sometimes they mess with everyone , other times they just create a huge lag on the session by spawning massive things.

There are companie  creating mod menus for money, advertising their work in every lobby with bots, rockstars wont do a thing about it though.

The game is very heavy, you ll need a good pc to run this with decent settings
The solo game is just bad, I finished it but it was a waste  of time. 

Pros decent graphics, the design is still great, great music collection. There is great detail and realism in certain aspects of the game."

5259,"GTAV online is a big fucking shitty grind and in public lobbies you tend to just get killed for doing your thing. thankfully they let you do your businesses in invite only lobbies now and the boost of the latest update to businesses and heists makes online much more playable. 
They also decided to add random events after almost a decade of wait. anytime you see a blue dot on your mini-map you're greeted with 15-20 minutes of fun. unfortunately you need to buy businesses for a lot of these blue dots to become available.
GTAV online is far less enjoyable on your own, it feels like a 9-5 office job. i recommend playing this game with a friend.

GTAV story mode is a very good game on its own, hours of content and enjoyable engaging story telling. story mode has replay value and exploring the map, finding all of its little quirks bumps up your enjoyment of playing the game. story mode is the only reason i recommend GTAV"

The worst thing, though, is the stupid rockstar launcher - I bought the game through steam. I want steam to be my launcher. I didn't want yet ANOTHER stupid thing collecting data without my permission on my computer. And yet about a year after purchase, I suddenly am required to install the rockstar launcher? Screw that.

5313,"Rockstar doesn't care about their players at all. GTA Online is unplayable as hell. Cheaters everywhere. Glitches left and right. This game has huge potential but they don't take advantage of it at all. They rather keep on making DLC and making more money then actually fix their game. Their game launcher is terrible and looks like its been made by a 12 year old. Also, gotta love how the Rockstar games client has more security than the average bank, yet when you actually join online it literally (figuratively) just gives away your information. There's so many aspects that are great in this game, but there's just as much anti-user friendly garbage in there too which make it UNBEARABLE. Hopefully GTA 6 will be a better game this is garbage can, but I doubt it"
5314,Hmmmmm. I think I don't like it after careful consideration. (look at time played)
5315,lester gave me head
5316,"The continual free DLCs are what keeps me coming back.  
Rockstar finally Nerfed the Mark2 Broomstick.
They also are letting players do business missions in solo lobbies.

They still have not, nor do they seem to care about the huge amount of Modders and Griefers  in Public Sessions.  The Peer to Peer connections are still horrible, making the loading times rediculous.  They need their own server farm.  They way the game is played online currently poses a substantial risk of getting Hacked by other players."
5317,amazing
5318,"Game is fun but its basically a sim ""see how fast you can get booted offline for being better than someone"""
5319,waste of time
5320,"great game, needs more updates (please!) but still worth the money."

5335,W gta 5
5336,BEST BUY AND ENJOY!!!
5337,"My friends and I loved this game, but waaaay too many hackers and when I say waaaay too many, I mean 4 in 5 servers we played in had hackers. 

You have your typical aimbot hackers, your God mode hackers, your make everything and everyone continuously explode so you can't even leave the server hackers, the lock you in a cage hackers, the turn you into something else hackers, the spawn a ton of stuff that make everything lag and crash hackers, my personal favorite the I don't know what they do but they make your PC crash hackers and much much more. If you can think of anymore, add them to the comments.

Also when you're able to run a heist with just your crew and finally separated from hackers, there are bugs that interrupt loading screens in the middle of heists so that one or more of your crew drop out and the heist ends in failure.

I loved this game but the hackers just got too bad and ruined it and even if you report them, they'll probably just be suspended for a few weeks and be back."

5359,its ok
5360,I seem to be stuck in a glitch; my next mission won't load... :( I loved the game until all I had to do was drive around...
5361,"the story is great online is dog ass 
only played like 30 mins and got a Perma ban then suddenly I'm hit with my files are modded notification when I retry the online what the fuck do you mean my game is modded reinstalled the game and defragged now am unable to go online for any reason at all and digging though the files there was nothing to find over the years of me playing this game I still can't go online because of my ban along with ""modded files"" I played in a single lobby and got banned. not to mention the excessive hours you need to even have fun in online with a single bike that renders every other one useless."
5362,this game is ass instead of fixing the game they add these useless dlcs that nobody is buying and they will get rid of modders but they lie to you they dont care about this game they just want money please do not buy this sorry excuse of a game.
5363,this game is so good plz downlowd it

5374,"I run into GAME BREAKING bugs every few hours. EVERY FEW HOURS. This game is a blast when it works, but holy #$%! it is the buggiest, most insanely frustrating game to play. 

It absolutely BAFFLES me that a game as hugely popular, insanely big, been around for like 10 years -- has this many problems. Rockstar, fix your f$!#%ng GAME."

5382,OK
5383,Works perfectly on steam deck!!! I hope Rockstar will release a remastered version!
5384,good
5385,Cool
5386,This Game is not worth playing on PC until haptic feed back for dual sense and the expanded and enhanced edition graphics come to PC. For now the experience is way better on PS5 which is unfair to the PC fan base.
5387,"I'm just now getting into gaming, so I find this game difficult as a beginner. Although, being terrible at playing is not taking away from how much fun I'm having. I really enjoy the variety of illegal things I can do as well as running from the police. I have a more difficult time using the controls, but I think it's just because I'm relatively new to gaming. An actual critique that I have is that there should be more accessible ways the make money for beginners, I'm so poor and have no idea how to fix that."
5388,not bad.
5389,Can't wait for it to come out on playstation 7

5394,"really fun and great, but sometimes you can get lost in story mode and not know what to do, or even know if you have mission but overall very fun."
5395,best
5396,"Ugh... This game is also one of my favorites because I like the story and the way the story is intertwined and the online part of it, which I think is impeccable because not many games can say that they have an online part with such graphics and such a long and exciting story. The only problem is also the online part is that since the introduction of these very good flying vehicles has spoiled the game experience by many people using it to cheat others , but that would not be such a problem if it were not for so many modders who are not in ""god"" mode that you have no chance to fight back , but I can still say that it is one of the best games , if not the best I recommend it to everyone!"

5430,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

5553,"Yes I've finished GTA 5 years ago (couldn't remember which ending), but playing again and choosing to spare both felt most rewarding BRING ON GTA 6 I love the series played all except for stuff like Chinatown wars etc 1 - 5 and vice city etc I've finished (except for 4 played it but never finished that's next until 6 releases), online is messed up so I'll happily stick to single player (and for anybody wondering yes you can continue playing after main story is finished)"

5564,"Before playing this game, I never played video games and my cousin's wife's uncle's landlord never talked to me. One day, as chance would have it, my cousin's wife's uncle's landlord saw me playing and taught me how to drive. I never knew how to drive in this game prior to my cousin's wife's uncle's landlord helping me with this. Now we have reignited our relationship. We have even taken a cross country trip to California and now he wants to go to Yukon and hunt lobster. If it wasn't for GTA  V, my cousin's wife's uncle's landlord and I would have never taken a cross-country trip and I can assure you that my cousin's wife's uncle's landlord would have never dreamed of going to Canada with me."

5607,uhm its kinda based
5608,"this is an actual reveiw. if you want to see something like ""coz gaeming"" move on. the game's graphics are obviously great for the time it came out in 2013. although it is one of the games biggest selling points, graphics are definetely something to count. the gameplay is very smooth, and the storyline is very well written. if you havent ever played gta 5 yet, i highly recomend you buy it when it is on sale. i got the premium version for less than the original! the soundtrack is very well composed aswell. thats about all i have, and thanks for reading this far! also you can make a goofy ahh character"

5622,gud gam
5623,HERE WE GO
5624,Best Game Ever Created
5625,"terrible loading times, movement terrible, glitchy and full of bugs, this game is terrible except when none of those happen. 3/10"
5626,"The single player version is fantastic. The online version is absolutely awful. No real explanation of what's going on most of the time, throwing new players to the wolves. You start with some money, but aren't allowed to buy any good equipment and have no skills. This would be ok if you could play with people at a similar level to you, but you're turned loose into a hellscape of high-level players with unbeatable weapons randomly killing everyone, particularly new players. The missions have virtually no instructions, and if you join missions with other people you have no idea what skill levels are going to be required, and often don't have the equipment needed to successfully complete the mission. There's constant messages popping up everywhere that you have to deal with, random events going on that pop up screen-blocking notifications (and will often cause high-level players to randomly start murdering you), and general chaos happening everywhere. The game is probably reasonably balanced for higher level players, but if you're low level you're basically screwed."
5627,verty good
5628,"great
"
5629,mass murder :)
5630,"Lester is my fav person.
"
5631,"Would definitely recommend this game. Very fun to play, the story is engaging and there are lots of places to explore around the map!"

5684,"Game Ini Mengajarkan Kita Cara Bermain Menjadi Psikopat Terroris dengan Menggunakan Cheat atau Bermain Secara Normal  dan Hal Ini Sangat Bagusss!!! Game Ini Juga bisa membuat kalian tergila-gila karna melihat video Youtubers Gta Online Melawan Griefer atau Tutorial Grinding Di GTA ONLINE. Dengan menonton video seperti itu, kalian akan termotivitasi Akan Haus Ingin Melawan griefer atau Haus Akan Kekayaan. Yang Saya Alami saat bermain di GTA ONLINE adalah 
1. Game Saya Sering di 'Crashin' Sama MODDER IBLIS. 
2. Dengan bermain GTA ONLINE menggunakan cheat, Kalian Bisa Terkena Epilepsi Karena ada orang yang menggunakan cheat explosive yang efek Percikan Cahaya yang sangat Berlebihan walaupun penyakit itu langka. (KARENA GW KENA EPILEPSI ANJING). 
3. Saya sering di gangguin sama griefer yang tidak memiliki akal budi pekerti. 

Jika kalian Sudah Muak Dengan Hal Tersebut Silahkan kalian uninstal game ini, karena Secara Pribadi Saya  Sudah cape dengan Fitur 'Offline Mode' Yang dimana kita tidak bisa bermain GTA ONLINE dalam kurun waktu berhari-hari dan aku nggak ada teman :(((. Yang Bisa saya simpulkan adalah JANGAN MAIN GTA ONLINE DI ATAS 1000 JAM KARENA SAYA SUDAH JADI KORBAN EPILEPSI.

5716,"I'm a 42 year old medical professional and family man who has been gaming since he was 3 years old (1983 - Commodore SX-64, one of the first ""portable"" computers with a 5 inch 16 colour screen, which I still have in it's original box, look it up).  

I enjoy playing this game online with several of my oldest friends who are also in their early 40's. I also game with a couple guys on Empyrion, world of warships and similar who are in their 60's.  Age means nothing, i'm sure there are older people still - we all love gaming, it's at the heart of our recreation and I hope that it will remain at the heart of yours when a lot of you get older.  The body gets older, but what the mind enjoys stays the same. My friends and I all live separate lives across the country and across the world.  GTA V remains one of the main ways that I can stay in touch with my friends from childhood, forget the troubles of the world and hang out.

So, in essence that's 39 years of gaming under my belt, of which I have played and completed every GTA ever released.  So i'd say I am someone who is more than qualified to truly use the phrase ""noob"" to a lot of the young, toxic punks who think we shouldn't be online.

One day I hope you'll reach this age, and far beyond. Your life will be different and, no doubt, technology will have changed. But, you'll still be gaming and i'll be in my 60's, 70's & 80's, still kicking your butt at the latest version of GTA, because people are NEVER too old to game. 

Viva la gaming !!! GTA rocks!

5867,"Most negative reviews I see are on the Online part. I have not engaged with that. I only played Story Mode and just quit in the middle of a mission and uninstalled the game because I got so bored with it.

- There is little (meaningful) to do besides story missions. 
- ""Activities"" like Tennis, towing trucks etc are pretty much pointless.
- Money is basically not a concept in the game. You get essentially no money for most missions/activities, and then a few bursts of absurd income through heists or stocks which allow you to buy any gear you want.
- The game is very easy with no difficulty options. There is basically no challenge except getting ""Gold"" on missions by fulfilling optional objectives. As far as I can tell, you do NOT know those objectives until you have completed the mission, so often you would need to replay the mission with the objectives in mind to get Gold. What's the point of getting Gold? I have no idea.
- Most missions are heavily padded by long drives, boring chases, waiting for stuff to happen etc. If you'd cut away all that stuff out, you would probably reduce play time by 50% or more.
- Missions and activities keep introducing new control schemes which are often terrible and you will never be able to remember all the button prompts until the next time.
- The main characters are idiots and the entire story feels contrived.

I don't think it's a ""bad"" game. But I do think your time and money is better spent elsewhere."

5971,"All in all, it's an amazing chapter of an amazing series.

But.
Ever since GTA 3, Rockstar managed to make GTA less playable on PC compared to consoles.
I'm talking about controls - it's not enjoyable for those who tries to play with (allegedly supported) keyboard and mouse.
Every installment has it's own way to spoil controls.
Vice City: no mouse steering for bikes.
San Andreas: normal mouse steering for bikes, but for cars, the wheels always drift to zero angle
GTA 4: no mouse steering. Fair enough. at least it's not declared as supported.
GTA 5: the steering for bikes has impossible sensivity, making them impossible to drive that way.

Is it made on purpose, idk. I doubt it's not.
Better buy it on consoles.

5975,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.
Strategy
His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.
The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.
A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.
The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.
However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.
Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.
It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.
In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.
Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.
When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.
Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.
Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.
If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.
For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.
For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.
They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider‚Äôs landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.
The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.
A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted
A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.
This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.
The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.
A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.
Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings.

I've completed the story and played through singleplayer countless times, and online (atleast recently) has been a blast to play. From the beginning, to the peak of oppressor and orbital cannon trolling, until the peace that is invite only enterprises now. It's been a blast. Shame Red Dead Online never got this treatment."

I find another one. Same bs. A player is trying to kill me so i kill them. They crash the lobby. Game also crashes. I start again. Game says make a new character. Weird. Not really. This has been happening since the ps3 days. I have made 4 new accounts over 7 years. Latest one for trying to play on pc. 

Nothing has changed about the modders, cheaters, griefers and above all the bs item prices. 'Just buy a Shark Card' That I'll be 60 bucks. So you can buy 2 cars and a can of opened sardines.  R* doesn't care as long as they make money. I don't understand how anyone can keep playing this game. 4/10 cause I had some fun in the early days but now its not even worth to mention this game."

6179,"Even 8 years later, this game is easily one of the best that you can buy. Whilst GTA Online has gone in a direction I don't like - and wouldn't really recommend in engaging very much with to complete newcomers by this stage - I can't ignore that it still has thousands of hours to offer players across a variety of different activities - there's something for everyone in GTA Online and it will also make them money whilst they're at it. Single Player is also undeniably a brilliant experience. Even though it will take you a while to get through to the end of the story, there's really no excuse for not playing it through at least once. A lot of us have got a bit tired of this game in the many years since it's original release, but from an objective point of view, even if this game released for the very first time this year, it would still be one of the best video games ever made and blow us all away. The driving is much easier than GTA 4, literally anyone can be a decent driver in GTA 5 unless you have brain damage, but I guess it makes it more accessible, lol. Shooting is also much improved and is high quality, and those two elements combined with many others, including but not limited to the excellent map, make this game a perfect sandbox."

I've had this since the PS3 before GTA:Online dropped and let me just say me feelings were much different about it back then. Even GTA:O was decent when this version released. Can not say the same now. My positive review is ONLY for Single Player. 4K60+ is a great way to play, just avoid GTA:O if you can."

There are so many hackers modding the game playing in god-mode, crashing your game on purpose, kicking you from sessions, and just constantly pestering you.

I got perma banned from GTA V Online for violating terms of service of hacking because I had hackers in my session.  I lost everything I worked long and hard for.  This has happened to me 2 times now.  My friend was also in the session with me after being out of country and he was also banned the same time I was.

Now, don't get me wrong... game is great and GTA V online is super awesome to play and get into.  However, there are just too many hackers and Rockstar now bans anyone who is near a hacker, even if they are innocent.  In their email they claim there is no way to argue the claim or to get your account back.   So, all in all, due to that alone, I have to say no do not get this game for that reason..."

6285,"Grand Theft Auto V. One of the most iconic games in gaming history. A game with an online that is worse than trying to perform your own surgery, without anaesthetic. And a story mode so fun, I could play for another 50 hours un-modded on another play-through. I want to talk about both and talk about how I like the game.

Grand Theft Auto V's Online at the current moment and probably for a long while, modder's are in every game. You could be blown up at best, and get ddossed at worst. The gameplay loop is semi-entertaining at best and boring at worst. As I have seen online, anyone with a mod menu can view your I.P Address so playing without a VPN is probably not a good thing. They can also kick you from sessions, blow you up, crash your game, trap you in a cage and give themselves millions of dollars.

The singleplayer experience is a amazing game. It is definitely worth playing. I have sunk countless hours on my Alternate Rockstar Account on Epic Games and my PlayStation account. The Story and the characters are so well built and the game feels fun. In the last month I have played 65-ish hours in the story mode. I love the story mode.

My suggestion is that you don't play the game online, or if you do, use a VPN, and do the 'Resource Manager' empty lobby trick. Buying the game full price is probably a big scam, buy it for around $50 AUD. When the game gets a massive online update, and when I sink in an additional 104 hours, I will add another paragraph."

No recomiendo comprarlo si se piensa jugar el modo online, lamentablemente esta inundado de modders y no se puede jugar tranquilo y lo peor es que son invencibles, ademas te quitan del juego, el unico momento donde se puede jugar es en la ma√±ana luego se conectan todos y es una lucha constante.

6360,After playing GTA Online for roughly 100 hours I can confidently tell you it can be a frustrating experience. The mechanics of the game were arguably alright. The players could be one of two things: the more common toxic and the people who are too nice to be mean. The cars of GTA are pretty good. They have plenty of nice cars and plenty of bad cars. I would rate this game [b]9/10[/b].

I don't like how ludicrous, in difficulty, some of the heists and missions are. 
I definitely like the submarine, and how it can be piloted while your crew moves around inside. The details in that thing are amazing.
I don't like how slow it is generate wealth, in order to afford the DLC, and other cool stuff. I know Rockstar has to make their money, somehow, but come on. 
I like how the world of GTAV has grown. There is so much more to do, than there was when the game first released.
Honestly, with the massive potential GTAV has, it should have had 3 times the content it has. today. I know it's not easy, keeping up the quality, juggling costs, planning, the cost of implementing changes, plus a hundred other things, but it's not too late to push a little more into it. 
My biggest and most infuriating pet peeve about GTAV, is that there are certain hills that a 5 year old could climb within seconds, but your adult character just can't figure it out. It is the single most clumsy thing that keeps this game from being perfect, on the standpoint of exploring the world."

So after all these years, I've finally finished this game
In my opinion, the core mechanics of this game are all very well done and polished, graphics are good, and story is mostly California/2013 society satire. If you take out the satire from the story its kinda bleak to be honest. Having said that, the three main characters are very well done and really fleshed out. City is awesome and so are the radio selections

6532,"Fix your game Rockstar. I am unable to do the easiest of tasks in a public lobby without getting glitched into a wall. griefed by  a modder, D-DOSed, or having the game crash.

I have a couple of suggestions to slightly improve the game (by slightly I mean greatly):

1. Does anyone actually like the fact that NPC drivers are programmed to randomly change lanes in front of you? Why is it a thing?

2. If a player has a level of 6000 and game  time of only a few hundred hours, why are they allowed to join any public lobbies? Even players who have been playing since the game came out are only around 1000-2000.

3. Check the chat logs before banning people who get cash dropped. Even a bot could easily do this by looking for the words  ""cash"", ""money"", ""give"", ""modder."" Then dont ban those who get cash dropped if they did not ask for it. 

4. eliminate the MK.2 entirely. There is no need for a flying bike that fires homing missiles. 

5. MODERATE YOUR SERVERS. even if it is undercover employees or bots acting as players. If Nuclear submarines are falling from the sky, hundreds of cars are being spawned per second, or more than 4 or 5 players are being transported to cayo perico, there might be a small chance that a modder is in the server. If there was a way to contact devs or submit proof of another player modding, modders would probably quickly die out or at least not last that long.

6. READ REVIEWS. I know this will not be read by a dev, so I clearly have too much time on my hands. but if a single tiny update added these features, it could fix the biggest issues of the game. 

Well I just wasted 15 minutes of my life. Overall the game is great, but the fact that these issues have been in the game for so long means that the devs clearly don't care about their players at all. Maybe at least one or two of these issues will be fixed when GTA 6 comes out in the year 2256.

6559,"Want to be a CEO? nope sorry the maximum in this lobby has been reached. Want to switch to another lobby so you can actually be a CEO and do heists? Nope you got disconnected so now we're gonna make you load into story mode and then switch back to online mode. Want to do heists? Nope sorry you're gonna get disconnected halfway through and have to restart the whole thing, or alternatively, you can do a heist and completely finish it but you don't get the money cuz yo moms a hoe. Want to enter your arcade? nah you're screen is gonna freeze and force you to completely restart the game. Want to go into any building or do something without taking a chance on your game freezing? Sorry but we're gonna put a loading screen in every possible spot we can so we can show you all the great opportunities there are in this game that nobody plays because its either boring or takes forever. Want to buy a deluxo or a vehicle that helps you get around the map? We gonna make you go through everything mentioned above at least 3 times to be able to afford it. and to have a somewhat less than decent chance to get money. Speaking of money, wanna earn some? No we dont do that here, we require you to do almost everything that has a less than worth it payout (except the cayo perico heist but we just nerfed that so its not as worth it anymore) with at least one other person. Wait i didnt catch that? Oh cant find someone to play with? Sounds like a you problem. Oh you actually got a teammate? We're gonna make him the lowest level possible that has no clue what to do, or we can give you a super high level that has done everything possible in the game so he just looks for people to play with to ruin their expierence. Did I mention everything in the game is super overpriced? or was that inferenced from the "" We gonna make you go through everything mentioned above at least 3 times to be able to afford it"" part. the only kind of positive thing about this game is the cayo heist but only because you can do half the heist solo. we also increased the cooldown timer so now you have to spend more time playing the game. what do i mean by that? To get the secondary loot, you need two people so really, doing it solo with the replay glitch is the only viable way of going about it."

6753,"Bought it for GTA Online mainly. Played for two weeks and then realized: The devs don't care about the enjoyment of the player experience, all they want is playtime, which is reflected by the boring and stale delivery missions, lack of passion in new updates, and just not updating security exploits and hacks. The game for sure was a a good game but as time went on (btw 9 years old!!!) the devs neglected it tremendously and are squeezing out every last of drop money and time out of players.

Neg:
- You are caught in a loop. To be able to play missions you need to buy certain properties and vehicles which cost millions, so naturally you just farm and farm and farm to collect the money. Basically you have to farm way too long to even be able to afford one item, because everything is so ridiculously overpriced (only to push the players to buy their sharkcards). Example: A Deluxo (flying vehicle) costs around 4 million, now you can earn these 4 million by playing delivery mission which at bets give you a slim chance to earn 100k each time or you can buy 4 million by sharkcards which translates to roughly: 50 USD real life money. Youre choice. It's either: A fat amount of time or a big chunk out of your wallet.

- The game has a lot of issues with toxic playerbase and hackers. Rockstar since release has MINIMAL efforts to solve these issues and just leaves the playerbase on their own, which I think makes honest players even quicker to join the dark side.

- It's all in all very unbalanced and designed to literally squeeze playtime out of you and drive you closer to buying one of their sharkcards.

Pro:
- The game on high settings doesn't look too bad.

- Cool cars and possibilities to tune them.

Bottom Line:
Don't buy the game at all, not even for it's campaign. It really just drags out time and (if you give in: real money) out of you. They do that because the game is now 9 years old and is about the get swallowed by its descendant: GTA 6, which will come out around 2024 -2025, so they are squeezing every last drop out of this game right now. If you buy the game now, you will basically just get shit on by the devs,

The story is absolutly nice with 3 Characters, different views of every single person and random missions.
It would be also great, when Rockstar Games would release here in the story mode some more updates.





GTA V Online:

It was an nice game, but update for update you getting more broke because you cant get easy money in the online mode.
So basicly you cant use the updates that hard because you cant buy anything, you must need to play missions for weeks to buy 1-2 items. It isnt the same like in the past versions."

I have looked for many, many and many ways to run this game, looked through GeForce NOW - game isn't available there, I tried Stadia - game isn't there... Even on xBox's Cloud Gaming this game isn't there, it's ridiculous how a nearly 10 year old game cannot be accessible in 2022 for a lot of people, the only place I heard this game could be played through streaming is Vortex where I have checked they don't allow any new people to register meaning new people won't have any access at all to this game..."

Rockstar doesnt allow appeals either which i feel is a horrible way to run a support service. i had nothing other than scripthook and they banned me without even giving me a ""warning."" many many many reviews said that they could play online with scripthook installed and not be banned BECAUSE IT HAS NO EFFECT ONLINE! Shit game, shit company"

6825,"There are only losers and modders left here, unless you stay long enough to find the half-decent people. It is easy enough to deter try-hards/pay-to-win win closed lobbies and a passive mode: although unmanned vehicles can still turn you into roadkill. Also, the story is normal Rockstar: bad people do bad things to worse people. Online and Story mode are best described as Cards Against Humanity: the video game."

each and every part is interesting and well i got to say the story missions are nicely done very statisfied.
The most that i liked along with the missions is the details of the game for example the surroundings and nature are interacting nicely.The Online part is also good but i rather play the car vs car, ramps and stunts like stuff they are awesome like casetoo {youtuber} he plays it,so i bought this game for rupees 950 and its awesome.

7000,"It's GTA 5 what's not to like. Everyone is mostly just playing this waiting for GTA 6 to come out which probably won't happen for another 5 years. Haha, but honestly the game is great and all. Online is toxic as always but if you truly want to have fun I would recommend downloading FiveM and try some modded servers that you will extra so much more than your normal GTA online that everyone is pretty much bored of by now."
7001,fun until hacker may try to return it
7002,its a good game 10/10.
7003,"The game itself is good, problem is with GTA online, Rockstar allows modders to completely disrupt sessions, by disrupt i mean a modder (among countless unfair things) can be invincible while killing everyone else, be able to know everything about your character even impersonate you in text chat, kill, teleport, trap and change looks for anyone at any time, put a cage around you making you immobile, and in many many cases: even be able to crash your game and force you to restart or reboot your machine. that's just from the tip of my head. Bottom line: if u play in a public session get ready for serious toxicity and grieving from hundreds if not thousands of psychopath hackers that R* doesn't do enough to stop them.

suggestion for R*: if you really don't care about people modding that much, at least detect modders, put them in modder-sessions and leave clean players to compete fairly in clean-sessions."

7012,"If you want to mod the game, tough luck. Rockstar for whatever reason wants GTAV and GTA Online to share the same executable and files, despite all the issues it causes for both them and their player base. Specifically here, it means that around 95% of the mods released for the game no longer work because the constant updates for GTA Online have broken them.

If you like the grindy, pay-to-win borefest that constitutes GTA Online, that's great, I'm happy for you. It just sucks that the mode has completely ruined one of the best aspects of the single player experience for what is effectively no good reason."

Excellent writing and gameplay! Rememberable and iconic protagonists! Unforgivable environmental storytelling and world building! 

The only negative feedback is all the random obstacles along the way. Kill corrupt and bad guys, rinse and repeat. Could‚Äôve had some weapons from online even if it‚Äôs not meta.

After completing the game a few times, there‚Äôs always the option to download Script Hook V. Always fun to mod the story mod with some extra challenges and realism. Maybe even a Native Trainer ;).

Has alright missions and heists to take a part in. A few businesses to own and expand. Low-end apartments to high-end penthouses, dope cars, smashing clothing, you name it. Really grindy most of the time. Best played with 2 or more ([i]so have friends playing the game with[/i]). Cannot forget that mf- orbital f- canon ([i]though, nowhere near what the online experience really has to offer[/i]). 

[b]The GTA Online experience[/b]

[i]Modders using godmode, aim botting, teleporting, removing weapons and cash, stalking, griefing, getting you banned, obtaining clients network identifiers, targeted harassment, outright toxicity, server and client scripts injections, crashing clients, boot looping, connection rejections. To name a few‚Ä¶[/i]

Don‚Äôt bother reporting anyone for modding. Not only won‚Äôt the report be submitted, but you‚Äôll also have to pay the price along with kissing your Social Club account goodbye.

Instead try and force the client into a new public session with only in it or a private session. However, once you‚Äôre targeted by modders this won‚Äôt get rid of them. Use custom firewalls like [url=https://gitlab.com/Speyedr/guardian-fastload-fix]Guardian[/url] so only whitelisted clients can join your session.

7068,Would be nice if they would actually ban the kids that hack the game instead of banning for swearing lol like get your priorities right rock star your game has been out for how many years an you have little to no anti cheat or anti hack system like tf get your stuff right instead of adding more an more an beating a dead horse how about you either fix this game and make it what it could be or release your next game already and hopefully with a new game you stay on top of your anti cheat systems instead of banning people that dont deserve it you ban the people ruining your game

7102,"As someone who likes singleplayer games, I was annoyed by a lot of the aspects of gta Online, HOWEVER, I still think it was more fun than gta 5 on its own. I was expecting something a lot different, as this was my first gta game. I guess I sorta thought it would be more like saints row, with a customizable player character, a bunch of jokes, and a lot of shooting. Instead there were a group of pre-determined characters which I had to switch between, none of which I really found interesting at all. Online at least let's you make your own character, which I really appreciate, and if you finesse the character creation, you can even make a good one. But the forced online aspects were really a bummer, especially since I hate gaming with other people and my wifi is pretty ass anyway. Yes, you can join a private session, but you can't have it default to that, so you have to change it every time, and a lot of the missions aren't meant to be done solo, so they can be a little balls to the wall depending on the mission type. That, and all the world activities are based on making groups with other players, which is fucking annoying when you're looking for something to solo. That being said, this game did have it's moments, and I certainly won't be refunding it, so I definitely have mixed feelings. I like that the player character in online is a silent protagonist, because noisy, chatty, annoying protagonists make me want to shoot things (which I guess is desirable anyway, but I digress). Overall, would recommend, but just wanted to warn people like me who are looking for a saints row-type game. This isn't really it."

7122,"Years after release, and it's still a buggy mess.

Rockstar only has one game online at the moment, since RDRO has gone away, so I decided to play some GTA Online for the first time. I was immediately greeted with graphical glitches, and my first time attempting to deliver crates for my business, to really get started with Online, the game glitched and I received zero reward for hours of playtime.

My friends said not to worry, as Rockstar support was good. I emailed support, and their response was to update my drivers. When I assured them that my drivers were updated, they gave me GTA$92,000 to rebuy the crates, when the mission that glitched would've gotten me GTA$480,000.

They requested video proof of the incident to provide any more help. I am incredibly disappointed with the game and wouldn't recommend anyone to purchase it, if they haven't already. GTA Online is a buggy, often frustrating mess that is a once-good developer's excuse for relevance. Pass."

Thus most of the online game is extremely grindy - boring and repetitive, with small payouts compared to the effort required to complete said missions. Any mission or heist offering a decent payout will either have the player's weapons nerfed like mad, or infinite waves of helicopters and other enemies to ensure mission failure. Also, for new players, it's pointless to join a public lobby as you will be killed/griefed within minutes. Very confusing initial gameplay, with little explanation of how the mechanics of roles such as CEO/Club President/VIP actually work. You will need to consult Youtube tutorials to play correctly. If you just want the 2013 game (story mode), which was very good, then go ahead, but don't purchase GTA V for the online play alone - you will be disappointed."

7219,"How to Make Baked Potatoes
The best part about this recipe is that it's so incredibly easy! You'll find the full recipe below, but here's what you can expect when making the perfect baked potato:

Season the Potatoes
Start off by rinsing and scrubbing the potatoes. Then, pierce each potato with a fork or knife so that steam can escape when baking. Coat the potato with olive oil (you can use your hands to rub it all over the skin or place the potato and oil in a zip-top bag and shake it up) and season with salt.

Bake the Potatoes
Bake in a 300 degree F oven until the potatoes are tender and golden brown, about 90 minutes.

Top Potatoes
Slice the potatoes and fluff the center. Then top with black pepper, butter, Cheddar cheese, chives, sour cream, or anything else you like.

How Long to Bake Potatoes
The baking time for baked potatoes will depend on the size of the potatoes. It can take anywhere between 50 minutes and 1 ¬Ω hours. 

You'll know the baked potato is done when you can stick a fork in the potato and it easily pierces through the skin. If the potato is still hard in the middle, keep baking it for a little longer. 

When in doubt, pull out your digital thermometer ‚Äî baked potatoes are done when they have an internal temperature of 210 degrees F."

7328,"Gta V was a good game to me because of the story mode. Back in 2019 I used to play this game on an xbox one every day. It used to be a hell of a time, but the story got repetitive. So I ventured into online. It pissed me of due to the toxic community and constant pressure to buy shark cards. Anyways, I ended up getting a pc in 2021 and buying Grand Theft Auto V on steam.
I also decided to add realism mods into the game and make it more challenging and sure enough the game was fun again. This meant that I got out of my comfort zone and got a ton of other mods such as, mission mods, texture mods, trainers, role play mods, and much more! This made going back to xbox so boring.

In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is an experience that is great. So long as you don't touch the online mode of the game. Especially if you play on pc, as this game has excellent modding potential.

End of review."

There is also a lot of missions that seem like Rockstar didn't full test it cause sometimes you just get stuck and so and so on. But even with that it's one of the greatest games ever."

We always have to do the final mission 5+ times until we do not get a bug preventing us from completing the mission (especially cayo perico). One or more always freezes when trying to collect loot/paintings/open keycards. Sometimes minimizing and reopening GTA works (but mostly not). Its staring to get ridiculous now, Id love to strategize how to complete a mission and not how to avoid and clear bugs."

That's where the other part comes in. And that is the simple fact that this game does not reward you for 100% of the work that you put in. It rewards you for ~60%. One of my biggest pet peeves in gaming is where you put your blood, sweat, and tears into a job just for it to give you an impossible task to complete the job, making the entire 2 hours of previous grind void. Didn't finish the job but completed 80 percent of it? Give me that 80 percent. Make a dumb excuse for the other part that I did not complete. But it does not. It gives you nothing for 2 hours of work. This makes the game, for me, completely unenjoyable and unplayable. The only way to get that time back, is to mod it back in. That is not okay. Reward players for their work... all of it."

Drive fancy cars, fly planes, buy and own fancy houses, etc. Dont listen to all those people like GTA is a terrible game abusing women killing people and crime. That's basically what the game is about but it matters what you do not what you can do. This is for all those kids out there who need a good reason to convince thier parents to get them this game.

7664,"Dla mnie to mo≈ºe byƒá najlepsza gra, w jakƒÖ kiedykolwiek gra≈Çem.

GTA to dla mnie od kilkunastu lat wyznacznik jako≈õci. Ka≈ºda kolejna czƒô≈õƒá wnosi co≈õ nowego i wiƒôkszo≈õƒá z nich stanowi pewien prze≈Çom w grach. A oczekiwanie na kolejny tytu≈Ç czy liczba graczy tylko to potwierdzajƒÖ. GTA V to dla mnie najwiƒôksze osiƒÖgniƒôcie w ca≈Çej serii, jej najlepszy tytu≈Ç.

Tutaj po prostu wszystko gra. To jedna z tych niewielu gier, gdzie niemal ka≈ºdy gracz mo≈ºe znale≈∫ƒá co≈õ dla siebie. Ogrom tej produkcji jak na sw√≥j rocznik powala. Mapa jest naprawdƒô du≈ºa, a poziom szczeg√≥≈Ç√≥w pora≈ºa - nie ma tu wt√≥rnych tekstur, ka≈ºda dzielnica, ka≈ºde miejsce jest charakterystyczne i unikalne. ≈öwiat tƒôtni ≈ºyciem. Mo≈ºna wrƒôcz powiedzieƒá, ≈ºe radzi≈Çoby sobie i radzi sobie ≈õwietnie r√≥wnie≈º bez obecno≈õci w nim gracza. Oczywi≈õcie czuƒá postƒôp na przestrzeni lat w stosunku do poprzednik√≥w z serii - tutaj jeszcze bardziej mo≈ºemy sobie wmawiaƒá, ≈ºe ≈ºyjemy w alternatywnym, ale jak≈ºe autentycznym (choƒá, rzecz jasna, przerysowanym) ≈õwiecie. Poza tym ten ≈õwiat jest piƒôkny. Gracz spƒôdziƒá mo≈ºe tu bez problemu kilkadziesiƒÖt godzin nie odbywajƒÖc ≈ºadnych misji, a zwyczajnie eksplorujƒÖc ≈õwiat i jego ciekawe zakƒÖtki. OglƒÖdajƒÖc zapierajƒÖce dech w piersiach krajobrazy, robiƒÖc im zdjƒôcia, nagrywaƒá filmy, albo po prostu urzƒÖdzaƒá sobie przeja≈ºd≈ºki w swoich ulubionych rytmach po swoich ulubionych terenach. To ostatnie by≈Ço w sumie od zawsze wielkim plusem serii, ale tutaj wzniesiono to na jeszcze wy≈ºszy poziom. Grafika naprawdƒô dawa≈Ça czadu i nawet dzi≈õ potrafi cieszyƒá oko. No i moje ukochane zachody s≈Ço≈Ñca, kt√≥re w niekt√≥rych miejscach wyglƒÖdajƒÖ wrƒôcz zjawiskowo.

PiƒÖta czƒô≈õƒá Grand Theft Auto to r√≥wnie≈º zdecydowanie najlepiej rozwiniƒôta warstwa fabularna spo≈õr√≥d wszystkich czƒô≈õci. To nie tylko sam g≈Ç√≥wny, jak≈ºe ciekawy, wƒÖtek, ale r√≥wnie≈º masa pobocznych. Ka≈ºda postaƒá ma swoje ≈ºycie i swoje problemy. I wszystkie te historie tak czƒôsto siƒô przeplatajƒÖ. Oczywi≈õcie przede wszystkim w przypadku tr√≥jki g≈Ç√≥wnych bohater√≥w. To akurat co≈õ zupe≈Çnie nowego dla tej serii. Od pewnego momentu gry mo≈ºemy poruszaƒá siƒô trzema postaciami. To w jaki spos√≥b po≈ÇƒÖczono ich losy zas≈Çuguje na uznanie. Moim faworytem jest Trevor, ale pewnie nie jestem tu wyjƒÖtkiem. Fajnym smaczkiem jest prze≈ÇƒÖczanie siƒô miƒôdzy postaciami i cutscenki, jakie mo≈ºemy w√≥wczas oglƒÖdaƒá. To jeszcze bardziej nadaje tej grze realizmu.

GTA V to dalej mocno gangsterska rozgrywka, cieszy, ≈ºe zachowano esencjƒô serii. Nie inaczej jest z poczuciem humoru. To prawdopodobnie najzabawniejsza ze wszystkich czƒô≈õci. Nie utracono tego wspania≈Çego dystansu charakteryzujƒÖcego franczyzƒô. Dalej jest ten komentarz spo≈Çeczny, brak temat√≥w tabu i na≈õmiewanie siƒô z regu≈Ç rzƒÖdzƒÖcych ≈õwiatem, szczeg√≥lnie showbiznesu, polityki. Jest w tym wszystkich niebywa≈Çy luz, ale moim zdaniem tylko tak mo≈ºna wykreowaƒá te≈º prawdziwe poczucie zagro≈ºenia, a takich misji tutaj bez wƒÖtpienia nie brakuje.

Jazda samochodami jest lepsza ni≈º kiedykolwiek wcze≈õniej (poza tym znacznie wzros≈Ça ilo≈õƒá modeli aut), bardzo przyjemnie siƒô te≈º lata czy p≈Çywa. Czuƒá tutaj te≈º faktycznƒÖ przyjemno≈õƒá ze strzelania (nie zrozumcie mnie ≈∫le), a i arsena≈Ç broni r√≥wnie≈º uleg≈Ç znacznemu rozszerzeniu.

Ostrzegam, gra potrafi porzƒÖdnie poch≈ÇonƒÖƒá. Ja uko≈Ñczy≈Çem jƒÖ na 100%, co wcale ≈Çatwe i szybkie nie by≈Ço. Mn√≥stwo poukrywanych przedmiot√≥w, skok√≥w kaskaderskich do wykonania, przelot√≥w pod mostami czy miƒôdzy budynkami, mn√≥stwo wszystkiego... to wymaga cierpliwo≈õci, ale w tym samym czasie jest wspania≈ÇƒÖ rozrywkƒÖ.

Na pewno na temat gry mo≈ºna siƒô rozpisywaƒá d≈Çugo. I na pewno miliony os√≥b przede mnƒÖ zrobi≈Çy to ju≈º w ciekawszy spos√≥b, dlatego nie chcƒô zabieraƒá zbyt du≈ºo waszego cennego czasu. GTA V to gra, w kt√≥rƒÖ prawdopodobnie ju≈º gra≈Ça≈õ, lub gra≈Çe≈õ, a je≈õli nie, to pewnie prƒôdzej czy p√≥≈∫niej zagrasz lub przynajmniej docenisz.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories. h"

The biggest issue is when you go on GTA Online. You cant even walk around to get some cigarettes, drink a cola, drive your car without a jet, or flying car blowing you up, seems like online mods are the way to go, the modders will make you look like noob ALL THE TIME and once your an executive there is no passive mode, so well its a PvP game when you play online which is both nice and extremely annoying.

7814,"Shame I can't review the singleplayer and the multiplayer seperately because they are very different in quality. Storymode is a classic, with a good story, interesting characters and all kinds of fun to have in between. Online though... online is a buggy mess. Rockstar is smart for combining the two games into one so I can't leave a bad review, because online would be torn to shreds. The loading times are horrific, the connection issues are painful, especially given you have to suffer the first issue as well because of it, and to top it all off Rockstar don't seem to care about mods, hacks or any other kind of game-shattering software. You'd be lucky to find a lobby that doesn't have at least one hacker in it, a bot that spams links to websites to get mods, or just a generally unpleasant kind of guy who will blow up your car because ""haha explosion"". Even still, it's the wild west in online and even if you have a party of people to play with, the quests are grindy, unrewarding and oftentimes unfair too. 

TL;DR Get this game for a great solo experience, but put it at the bottom of your multiplayer games list."

7817,"w game but cant play it cause rockstar services wont connect rip
"
7818,very good game
7819,"would i recommend this game? i definitely wouldn't, and here's why.

the online is super bad and toxic filled with russian hackers that do nothing but hack the game, along with trollers that like to kill you on sight out of random, taking away the fun the game has to offer but the game itself is fun with the single player/online has to offer but the toxicity with the players online and the hackers is just plain disgusting, not to mention how discusting it is that the company that mods the online servers don't do a damn thing about the hackers only letting them ruin everyone else's fun in online games, stopping players online from gaining or at least trying to relax and play with a friend without the need of having to be killed in an instant from a hack menu that hackers use to harrass players during a mission two friends are doing in CEO missions.

my top rate for this is 2/10 terrible online and lack of moderation showing rockstar doesn't care about there players in-game"

7878,"GTA5 is the Goat of Urban crime gaming in a simulated environment. 

The level of detail to the level design, and where the game is at as of writing this... if this was released today it would be an AAA game for just GTA Online.

I don't think much more needs to be said about the game itself. So let's move on to the players and the business model.

First off the Shark Cards by themselves is the industry normal. In my honest opinion, unless you are making about $100+ an hour at your job, Shark Cards are NOT worth it.  So if you are single, living with your parents and pulling in close to 70-90k a year go ahead. Otherwise you are an addict and need help if you find yourself in defense of purchasing these - and I am not being offensive here: 

Rockstar's business model uses the adversarial nature of the game to increase the difficulty of avoiding the use of Shark Cards. Pack that with their new content all being behind pay walls further all but coerces you to consider Shark Cards.

But the real issue isn't just the subversive tactic here, it's also that there is no stability to the game to justify considering Shark Cards as paying for a service. (Which would give them more value in my book). Imagine trying to form a group, you guys are doing a CEO mission and suddenly your game crashes, okay you dust yourself off relog in and spend the time to form up a group again, a few minutes later it freezes and you crash, or you end up in a cage, or you get booted to story mode. This is the poison diminishes the value of GTA Online, the game is unplayable online and so I will not recommend this game."

7906,"I highly recommend this game. its got a fantastic story, controls are fluid, and it has lots of fun,hilarious, and tense moments. you really end up relating to the characters and will put alot of hours into this. i bought this for PS4 a year after it came out. i must say however that the Online mode has really deteriorated in my opinion. at first it was pretty balanced but now you have rocket bikes that can fly and grief you anytime they want. 

there is alot of emphasis on micro-transactions that make it difficult to enjoy as you could drop like a couple hundred dollars and have an advantage. i played all the way to the ceo update and now only really play it for the story. alot of minors playing online which is extremely annoying as the community can have some pretty harsh language. youngest kid ive heard over the chat was a 5 year old up until 2am getting mad because people were running him over and shooting him with missles via Fighter Jet. 

i really enjoy running stories until i get bored, then i just start causing chaos."

I'd be more angry about this, but I know I'm not really missing much. The story mode is ok, and the online mode is fucking awful. I don't even need to get into how poorly designed the online gameplay is. It's way too grindy, and at times it feels unfair because of children who run around blowing people up for literally no reason.

8172,Do I really need to say anything about goddamn gta v?
8173,"Yes it had a rough start. Yes there were a lot of things promised that weren't there, but they have worked hard to bring us much of what was lacking, and the game is much better for it!

If you are expecting this game to be a fast-paced sci-fi thrill ride, you will be disappointed. Yet if you play it for what it is, a game heavily focused on exploration, and don't mind a slower pace starting out, you might be like me and learn to really like it. I find it great when I want something casual, and laid back. Sure, it gets a bit annoying starting out with having to repair your equipment seemingly way too often. Yet once you get on a planet with a decent environment, that isn't such an issue. Then you get vehicles (look up how to get them as I could have gotten many days earlier if I had know it). They help a lot.

Tips
1. Early on, don't worry about hanging onto everything. You can't. Find stuff that has a high value (tooltips tell you). Trash the low value stuff, and load up your bags with high value stuff. Then go sell it at a space station.
2. The stuff you need to fuel your ship (Tritium) can be found shooting up asteroids and the crystal formations stuck to them, just beyond your planets atmosphere! Easy to farm.
3. Scan for and get buried technology. Use them to buy blueprints of crafted items (buildings, vehicles, etc.)

Don't trust the haters. Some people never forgive, and some people think their opinion should be they only one, attempting to peddle it as the truth. If you are intrigued, then watch some peeps on Twitch. Ask questions, and learn. Find out for yourself if the game is good for you. Good luck all!"
8174,i was permanently banned from online even though i never did anything against the rules. and to make it worse i can't even contact Rockstar so f me i guess...

8215,"Don't waste your time on GTA Online. You'll get hooked by the gameplay loop of endlessly grinding missions, heists, and businesses, play for a couple hundred hours within the span of a few months, then get account wiped the second you make any accidental interaction with a modder. Oh and as a bonus R* makes all bans final without appeals. This change was made after one of many false ban-waves they've had over the years. Don't believe me? Look at when that change was made and the number of false-ban threads made around the same time."

I am a huge fan of Grand Theft Auto 5 [GTA 5] Online. I have to say that I am very pleased with what the Rockstar Games developers have done with their latest updates to allow for players to do much more with business jobs using the Invite Only sessions. I for one play the game without cheating (exploiting) and find it very frustrating to join Public servers due to players who like to use exploits to blow me up repeatedly so well done Rockstar for finding a solution for this.

My most recent interest has been running the Cayo Perico Heists as it allows me to add much more to playing this game. I would like to add that GTA V Online is pretty much the only game I have an interest in playing every day.

Keep up the fantastic work Rockstar Games."

8396,"What did I like? 

Living out a criminal fantasy without worrying about consequences. 

There are consequences for playing this game though. It is highly addictive. It will waste a lot of time if you let it. 

Don't cheat. Cheaters never get any respect.  If you cheat there is a ban wave that will get you eventually. 

Don't go out trying this shit in real life. Have some sense. 

Realize when someone or something is trying to manipulate your minds.  This game might actually be teaching people to hate police among other things such as desensitizing you to the pain you cause to other people or animals. It may even influence the way you drive on the road. People don't think about this stuff. The problem is that if we train our pleasure sensors incorrectly we may end up doing bad things that we might not otherwise do.  Remember that this is a game but all influences in our lives can in fact affect us psychologically without us even knowing it if we don't pay attention.  If we let those bad seeds fester they can contribute to grave consequences in real life so keep it in the game. 

Definitely have fun but please remember to separate this portrayed reality from actual reality."
8397,yes

I am not gay. I just have too much sex with real women to spend more than 400 hours in this game. on the other hand i would recommend this game to people who do not have sex (unlike me because i have lots of sex with women a lot) as there is a naked woman in it and she is naked, she kinda looks like one of my many girlfriends who i have sex with a lot. I have lots of sex. I also an very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because I am very muscular and handsome and very good at video games, all my girlfriends say im very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome, have sex with her. i have sex with women, not men. I am not gay. i am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because I am very cool and sexy. my penis is very big. all my girlfriends like my penis because it is very big and I am very good at sex with my women. every woman ive had sex with is very sexy and so am i. i have lots of sex. i am also very handsome and sexy and i have lots of sex.

It's a GTA game, what kind of review do you expect here.

Single player has a good bit of story but feels slow paced and there being 3 different characters you play doesn't give you any attachment to them at all so you don't really care, one character would have been enough.

Multiplayer is pretty cool, but over-stuffed with content for stupid prices now that if you started from scratch you'd not finish anything properly until probably after GTA6 is released.

Would I buy it now knowing what I know after hundreds of hours of game.. sure."

When you dont  you have to pump in the hours and save up your money. Not been able to spend any of your money on things you want, as you need it.  ""No flying cars for me as i need to buy food for my family in real life""  LOL Even taken out your wallet is a rip off. I say to my self. ""All of them hours are going to pay off when i get this business""
You get it. Then you say yeah its ok. You tell your friend its great. ""You need this"". Just so you don't feel cheated inside. You did after all spend hours of your time driving  A to B to get a few thousand to be able to even play it.
It always turns out to be just ok. The next Carrott on a stick is waving in front off you.
At what point will i be able to buy nice cars? Flying bikes? Great weapons? Maybe a couple of hundred hours?
It feels like I'm playing a Mobile game.  All this content gated away. No fun for you unless you dedicate your life to it or take out your wallet. 
It can be a Fun game when you have a friend who put in the hours or spent the money over the years. He has the equipment to skip a lot of the bull. 
He can get you into a mission. Have fun and get paid. With out him it takes hours. Lets not forget i paid for this. Its not a free to play game.
There's my rant over with. Enjoy. But i feel as a new player in 2022 its not worth it."

8524,"I am playing this game since it released. Spent thousands of hours across console platforms and generations, and now I am still playing on PC. I AGED while playing the game, got an adult. You may ask what changed in my life since I first placed game's disc in my XBOX 360... still playing. I don't think there should be anything more to say except to admit that I cry before I fell asleep... while watching GTA videos. Guess need help. Have fun."

8590,Online is full of hackers and spammers in the chat.  Can barely play the game some nights.  Other nights game just crashes while you're driving or on a mission.  Game is garbage with zero moderators.  Absolute waste of time to play due to how unplayable it is at times.

8595,"GTA V online is all good fun, and has really good potential. It has a lot of content to offer and keep you real occupied for a really long time, but there is just one real big downside. The servers/sessions. The company needs to really work on the game servers in terms of security and fairness for the whole game. It has been really hard for me to try finding good servers online, not even 1 I came across lately that I can at least call 'decent' as hackers completely destroy the whole game, even to the point of that server/session crashing the entire game for everyone. The only hope I'm having right now at the moment, is playing this game with my only friend in a private session, and have good clean fun. But other than that, there is no existing way to fully explore and enjoy things the game has to offer, because of that one major downside flaw: hackers destroying online games. Literally. I hope the company fixes this soon, before all the servers/sessions get all crashed, and maybe even taken down by hackers. Appreciate your time for reading, and hope you consider my review for what it is."

8603,"honestly the system for making money in the game doesnt match the unreal prices of everything avaliable and as a new player starting out this clouds the gaming experience also ive noticed quite a few hackers in public servers doing dumb things like blowing everyone up over and over again until they get bored, Rockstar really has to start focusing on these issues because it seems to me they only really focus on fixing money making glitches and not the actual problems the game has, if they don't make profit off of you playing whether its in shark cards or game bundles they don't really care about any of the other glitches for example the game breaking invincible glitch or the (like I stated early) large amount of hackers on the platform"

8683,"if there is one thing that is good that would be the graphics for how old this game is. however, with all the hackers this just ain't a fun game anymore. at most this is a 3/10 considering that the most major part of it (the online) is essentially inaccessable and unplayable most of the time unless you have a closed friends/invite only session and as on today 8/8/2022 that isn't even the case anymore yet again. thanks rockstar you really know how to entice an audience."
8684,great
8685,It is a super good game. I would say to play it if you like open world games or if you like open world online games because it has an online mode. Online can be fun but not as fun when there is modders killing you over and over. But other than that it is a good game. you can also just join a new game if there is modders.

8694,"As opposed to what a lot of people think, GTA V is one of the best entries in the series. Clearly proven by it still being played by hundreds of thousands of players weekly on every platform, nearly 9 years after release.. The story mode is nothing short of fantastic and a breath of fresh air from previous entries most notably because of the 3 playable characters. The game STILL looks absolutely beautiful especially on maxed out settings. 

Gta Online however i still believe to be great. There are some very big annoyances that come with it though. Such as TOO MANY HACKERS, having to grind, inflated prices of cars, OP vehicles (MK2 opressor) and SharkCards being inconsistent. But even with those issues, the game can still be loads of fun especially with friends. Of course there aren't as many frequent updates as there once was but we still get decent updates. The past few updates have been nothing short of about a dozen cars, some small story missions and quality-of-life changes. But we still have almost 9 years of content that has been added over the years. Especially if you are just starting.

There's also the modding community and FiveM community that make the game even more fun with loads of different minigames and RP.

 GtaV can be found on sale almost all the time for just over $15 with tax. I definitely recommend trying it out."

8719,"GTA V Story - Good Narrative, Decent Gameplay with 3 main character dynamic.
Great mechanic of switching 3 different characters on the story, Each of the 3 characters are unique and different personalities. The map is a really modernization of San Andreas map and it makes the place more populated and close to reallife. 

GTA Online - Tons of mission, content but also has a TONS of hackers.
GTA:O has a tons of content, racing, shooting, stealing sh*t, heist. It also innovates on putting the challenge on other players like MC and CEO jobs where other players can see you finishing a mission. This creates a great dynamic on player rivalry in business. HOWEVER you are 99% going to play with a cheater. This game is filled with cheater griefing so you can't even do those jobs properly, if not cheaters someone with a really high level with advanced vehicles ( oppressor etc...). You can still create private lobby but it kinda fails the player gang rivalry I mentioned. 


Verdict:
 GTA V -8/10 
 GTA:O - 7/10"
8720,Last update totally bugged it on steam deck. everything gets blurry and the game crashes
8721,This game is very fun but the amount of cheaters is tremendous. Don't buy this game if you're not willing to have to server hop a lot of the time.

Over a decade, across almost all platforms, nothing was ever done about the modders, the exploits and the griefers. Never stop throwing your money at Rockstar, especially now that Dan jumped ship and Sam seems lost in the GTA 6 production.

Should you get it for free, ask for your money back nonetheless."

8761,"The kind of game where loading times are so long you forget that you are playing, then get kicked for idling once it eventually loads in. Also multiplayer has so many cheaters who use mods to ruin it for others, you may as well not bother.
The campaign was not bad though."
8762,Honestly the best game over all. I have had so many hours on both ps4 and pc. Most games geet boring for me after a while but with GTA suprisinglz this was not the case! recomennd 20000 out of 10

8792,"Very cool game but it's plagued by basic problems like anti cheat, and connectivity issues which send this game back 5 years
I completed GTA III, Vice City, Liberty City Stories, SA and V 100% and I love these games, I also finished all the GTA Online's heists and main missions but I wouldn't search for all the collectibles as it's very tedious.

There's a pattern of dull missions in GTA Online and it's saddening. It's such a great game with a questionable execution focusing mainly on boring you out of your money for shark cards... 
Ignoring many problems like incredible loading times and super expensive weaponry to battle against griefers you can actually have fun, but it's tiring and my friends who more casually play these games won't join this slow-loading game :/

I have mixed feelings even after 1100 hours mostly playing online"

8954,"Rockstar just ruined the best and only heist there was for solo players, 90% of the time I played heists with other people they were modders, teleporting and killing everyone(my reason to play alone). We only want a way to make money where we don't risk our accounts any further and we don't get even that, instead Rockstar worries only about making you play with people you don't want to be with, and if that's not an option for you then just pay them for money in-game. Modders and griefers are the true issue in the game that Rockstar doesn't take care of, which has also made me play only in private sessions by myself(and both kick and report options DO NOT work as there's still modders around that haven't been affected and still do as they please).
If you plan to buy this game for Online, do not do it, look for another game, if you already bought it for the same reason, refund it while you still can, you'll get nothing but people making your life impossible and risking your account getting banned with no possible appeal, which means your very own money being wasted and stolen."

8978,"Well GTA V...
Played it on PS3 in 2015 and for 2471 hours total on PC on other account that I created in 2018. I really enjoyed it. Playing Singleplayer for me never gets boring and annoying (even when you play it for the 8th time like me). Campaign is really worth playing. Same as GTA Online. When you are playing Online alone it feels like you are very lonely in huge open world. So get at least one friend to play and have a great time playing races, deathmatches, adversary modes, freeroaming and much more! There are a few cones in GTA Online like: really big inflation and griefing on public sessions but you can get used to it.

8979,I highly reccomend mods for single player. makes the game so much fun. completely reccomend
8980,its good
8981,"Dog shit of a game.
Game that has been out for some many years by a AAA producer and still infested with so many bugs that it makes it unplayable. Just a fucking bad joke that shows incompetence of triple AAA game producers that only want money while providing a subpar/shit product. (Basically wants gold bars for a piece of turd)."

8995,"Do not play in public lobbies as the possibility of getting doxed is possible due to this game being a peer to peer setup as your not connecting to a rockstar server but a regular user that hosts everyone . I recently got ""doxed"" by a user while playing gta 5 online on steams version and so far Steam and Rockstar are not doing anything about the problem even though the hostile user flooded chat with my personal information . I have been playing gta 5 since its release on the xbox 360 in which there was modders back then but they were rare and when they would show up the most they would do is spawn things in , achievement unlocks , money drops , take control of users character/vehicle but never have i seen the release of personal information like i did on this platform . 

This game needs to be taken off of sale including its shark cards until something is done about these sorts of issues that occur."

9021,"I could never really get into the game. Stereotypical main characters were the most draining part, how it really pushes you away from your goal, and nothing compared to the previous iterations of GTA. GTA IV did much better with driving physics and immersion. Maybe I've just matured over the years but this game never held my attention for long."
9022,fun
9023,"This game's graphics look stunning for a game made in 2013 (better than most games 2022). The pvp in this game is meh. The movement is janky, pc lobbies have at least 4 modders in them, and the story is boring. The open world is also amazing from everything from spooky mountains to beautiful lakes hidden by them waiting to be explored. The sunrises and sunsets in this game look stunning. There is so much you can do in this game. From taking a hit from a random bong laying on a table to driving a fucking submarine. Playing this game 2022 on PC is extremely difficult. The money grinding methods are so trash you have to resort to glitches in order to make millions. Which in this game's case, isn't a lot of money. However, once you accumulate enough money to buy everything in the game, there is no point. This game is a grind. There is nothing else. I thought once a had all the money things would be fun but no, once you're rich in this game it's over. The content in the game in to contribute to the grinding of money, which isn't fun to begin with. That's why if you're planning to buy this game 2022, try to have fun while grinding for money, and do not try  to get money the most efficient way possible cause it isn't fun that way. Even though did not recommend this game, I still had some fun playing, and I will continue to play it until number 6 comes out."

Bad side: unmaintained servers, full of hackers giving u money or griefing you, kicking u outta servers, etc. There is also so much time wasted on loading screens and terrible queue/lobby system for missions/heists. And when you earn money, it's pocket change for a good 15-30 minutes spent. They're telling the average player: here, go do these missions and waste as much as time as possible for 100000 after 6 hours. OR you can have 100000 right now and save a lot of time.

9293,Story Is good and Online Is fun.
9294,:^)
9295,"It's a great game, I've played a ton of story mode and online but the best part about this game is the crazy mods that people make for it, mods that Take Two have decided to DMCA strike by abusing the system that's in place for their own benefit. Bethesda's out here hiring modders yet Take Two is stuck in 2010 and think they own everything that anyone ever makes to improve the major part of the game they've completely abandoned since it's launch nearly 10 years ago, modders don't want to make new mods for the game and ultimately that's what will eventually kill it. They'd prefer to push people into spending more money online than to play the story mode that the Devs likely put far more effort into making."

The problem are the game-breaking bugs and crashes.

Do you like going on missions for 10-15 minutes and then have the game crash just before you get the reward?
Do you like waiting 30 minutes to join a heist and then not being able to complete it due to a stuck NPC?
Do you like having to suspend the game process for 15 seconds almost everytime you join a server just to get out of the loadingscreen?

If so, this game is for you."

9378,"Literally 80% of the lobbies have modders in them. I don't really give a shit if someone is modding, but when they almost always grief other players."

9423,the game is full of hackers and i'm sure rockstar won't do anything about it but if you don't have this for PC don't get it. It's not worth doing the online gameplay maybe the story missions but not the online. the game use to be fun but now there's really no point unless you are in a invite only session where no one can mess with you (hacker wise). not my call whether you buy it or not just a little warning for those unaware.

9473,"Not as good as GTA IV but it is still a good game, as a whole. Of course, compared to GTA IV the map is way bigger and far more varied with it's desert and forest areas as well as the huge city, making it feel like a real world small island at times. The missions are also more varied since you have the gangster aspect of Franklin, the family aspect of Michael and the business aspect of Trevor. When they all come together you get some amazing heist missions which are really fun too and with the updated controls of vehicles, special abilities and the weapon wheel it makes gameplay feel less realistic but overall easier to get into and faster paced. I will admit that I do miss the gunplay of GTA IV here though because its much simpler here and the characters don't act as realistically as they do in IV when they get shot so it makes it a bit less satisfying to me. The story that links the main characters isn't as good as GTA IV either, GTA V goes way more silly and larger with it's plot and that isn't a bad thing but I do prefer the grittier and darker plot that IV has (same goes for the tone of the game, V feels like an obvious mockery of America but IV feels more 'subtle' (it isn't subtle, but more subtle than V)).

The only reason I play this game really is the offline mode - I've never been a big 'online gamer' anyway but I'll admit this one is a step down from GTA IVs in my opinion. In GTA IV, you are just given the world with free weapons and vehicles to mess about with, I have great memories playing it with friends back in the Xbox 360 days and us just having a laugh, with GTA V it's way more serious as if it's its own game. You have to find ways to make as much money as you can through heists, businesses, races, etc. Any vehicle or weapon you want costs a fortune in GTA Vs online and it's so annoying. Hackers are a problem too, on GTA IV there were also hackers but they would just hack crazy vehicles in and stuff like that so they could have fun with you, in V it feels like everyone is against you and you can't do anything.

Sorry to compare IV to V a lot but I feel like I have to because they're both the only HD Universe GTA games at this point really - it just felt like the best way to show improvements and/or downgrades. So overall, I do recommend GTA V, the world is enormous, the missions are fun (for the most part) and the controls are responsive/fluent. I can only recommend GTA Online if you're into that sort of thing; it isn't for me, I way prefer the simplicity and freedom that IVs online provides, but it isn't really that bad on a technical scale... I just hope it dies soon so we can get GTA VI."
9474,"i mean its still a good game, but they should have changed the que system for heist. sitting there for sometimes 2 hours just to get people together to fail the damn thing sucks ass."
9475,"Great game, great story, this game is really fun too! although online is a bit way too chaotic because of the hackers, SCREW THEM"
9476,.
9477,"very good!

9497,"ITs a multiplayer game that offers Third person and First person views all the way down to iron sights -something I find appalling in CS:GO, multiple types of games within the game, from car races to aeroplane acrobatics to Jetskis jumping waves, and the endless types of missions available. This game has everything that most games out there only have a few pieces of. Playing with friends is a necessary need and is the most fun. However modders frequent the servers as do spam bots, and your average run of the mill hackers. But its guaranteed in most games these days isnt it?"

9610,"I have played this game for about 3-4 years. This game, much like war thunder is a hell hole and a lot of fun. I played story mode for most of my time on PC because I couldn't find how to play online as it didn't let me. (You have to scan the files. If some fail then just ignore it), The info is from Rockstar on their website which transfers you to the steam website and tells you there. GTAO is a different story but it's both fun and incredibly frustrating. Good balance if you ask me. It's a great game if you want to die or experience being suicidal. I say get it!"

9709,"It‚Äôs not the same GTAO as it was back in 2013. Back then before all the overpowered militarized vehicles came out and the Opressor Mk2, it was very enjoyable and played the game how it was meant to be. Robbing stores, selling cars off the streets, etc. for a little bit of money. Nowadays you got flying motorcycles with griefers, people with mod menus, and the old time players who used to can play this game to enjoy, can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre killed 20 seconds into loading in the lobby. Also, if you don‚Äôt have a mod menu, cash is king with their micro transactions they call Shark Cards. Everything in the game is overpriced. You either have to have a mod menu and hope to not get banned, but shark cards, or grind your whole real life away to make any money to enjoy anything Rockstar releases. It was an absolute blast while it lasted, now it‚Äôs just a total dumpster fire."

9968,Good game
9969,"This game is great, Lots of things to do, great progression. On the other hand if you want to play this game on the same level as everyone then your only option is to play on a invite only session. Modders have taken over this game more than any game i have ever played. Every session is full of modders and the game wants you to run the risk of driving cargo to one end of the map to the next, this isn't likely to happen because it marks you on the map and modders just need to click on you with their menu and bam you either blow up or they just kick you out of the game entirely wasting hours of waiting for it to fill up or if you bought supply for it then you also lose the cash spent.
I love this game but i could not recommend this game's online to anyone till the devs decide to do somthing about in a major way."

9998,"The loading system is atrocious. Loading simulator. Exhibit A: you join a heist/ job through quick play, but they kick you right before the job launches, what do you get? An infinite amount of time in the sky whilst the rotating circle to the right says ""INITIALIZING"", like what it could be initializing, their failure at preventing such issues. Rockstar Games maybe big, but it is not big enough to solve the issues with loading (because who cares about clients who get stuck during the loading process). This ""ONLINE"" game is wayyy to dry regarding content, I would rather play Warzone or anything else (cause RG has become so linear these days, literally unplayable)."

10057,he good
10058,"The single player experience is certainly recommended.

However, Rockstar does nothing to stop all the script-kiddies and modders from ruining the multiplayer experience and turning it all into a clown show. In fact, Rockstar has allowed such rampancy for so long, they appear to encourage it. For that reason alone, I encourage you to look elsewhere if you want to play with friends. I don't know of a more toxic community in a game."

10060,18+ good control

For the online mode get a few friends to play with and only play on friends only sessions public servers are filled with spam bots and cheaters"
10092,"Campaign is the best I've ever played, but GTA Online... Think people on flying bikes with missiles that sabotage your hard work just because they can, not even for a benefit. Also modders. LOTS of modders. R* doesn't seem to care too much about them though, so don't expect them to get banned. Besides that, Online is pretty fun, especially if you can find some friends to play with. At the time of this review, I have exactly 500 hours, and am on my second character. Although it has it's faults, I would still reccomend GTA to a curious friend."
10093,"Before playing this game i had no GF, no money, and no job. after about 90 hours. struggeling with hackers and crashes.
I still have no GF. no money, nor a job. but i've just gotten the submarine and i can do big boy heists so im having a pretty good time."
10094,"After almost 10 years and over 450hrs in game..
.. it's time to say something.

This is the 2nd game I've played so many hundreds of hours.
Single player campagin was pretty good fun, I didn't know about Online differences until I got it running several years after premiere.
You probably know that all but You'll get into Los Santos city, which was based on real city Los Angeles and join campagin as 3 persons separately: Michael, Trevor Phillips and Franklin. You'll be involved in hundreds of missions that aims on money, stealing, killing and many more criminal activity. Your target is being rich as **** possible and get as many many properties as You can get. Funny dialoges, epic moments, unlimited bullets, car stealing, cash dropping everywhere.. have You done everything? If not, jump in again and do it - before GTA 6 shows up!
Online features is another story.. it's like completly different game mode. The city is the same, but let's say... everything is overclocked and improved. I didn't know how far it goes until first joined server.. it took me 2 weeks to get out from online city at first time. Yay! Unlimited possibilities, endless DLCs in multiplayer for free, more powerful guns, more beatiful cars and deadly good players on each step may kill You any time. Yes, it was and still is pretty good fun. Only session match mechanics, endless loading screens, the cheaters ... sometimes ruin the fun. If they don't show up You're on pretty straight road to many hours of fun.. I hope GTA 6 will be better, bigger, prettier and without multiplayer issues mentioned here."

10102,"I am a 47 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 16 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, got my car and map and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

You have to expect griefers, toxic a**holes and wallet warriors that bought the truly bullsh*t oppressor and pursue you to aid their K/D by .001 points. But if you don't mind that and have some friends to play with you, this game is extremely fun to mess around or do heists. Making money is grueling but satisfying when you can afford your 2,000,000$ clunker car."

The game is full of hackers (60% of the time you will have a hacker in your lobby killing you) and I don't see why a big company like Rockstar hasn't added an anti-cheat or made one. I would up vote the game if they fixed the hackers situation but they haven't.

You also risk getting banned if you use ""cheat money"" even if it was not your fault (e.g. you drove by where money was being dropped). Aside from that you have to put up with the hundreds of in-game ""ads"" such as Lester calling, etc. Avoid GTA 6 on PC because I'm positive it will all be the same."

Whenever I start the game, 99% of the time I have to fix my Screen setting (Full, Windowed, etc), and any other settings it reset.

Constantly getting calls from NPC's that I couldn't give less of a shit about.
Getting messages in online deleted because of those calls, and forced to retype the entire thing, or do it in itsy-bitsy pieces so no call can delete the entire thing.

The online version is rife with trash who are constantly crashing the game, cannot be killed or harmed, and who have unlimited resources, weapons, and the ability to change the game code during the game play. The fact that Rockstar sells this game, in cooperation with Steam, and then does absolutely nothing to ensure that those who pay for it have a decent playing experience, amounts to what I believe to be gross negligence and fraud. They should be sued en masse and stripped of their right to make or sell games to the public. Shame on everyone involved in this racket!"

Online on PC, I just got GTA V on PC today. I just got kidnapped, meet a modder, and got shanked by a level 5 all in like 30 minutes I believe. If you want more of a serious Online playthrough, get Online on console. PC Online is very chaotic, modders and just overall more crazy. From my experience PS5 is a lot more chill, Story is immaculate, the story never fails to make me entertained."

10630,"Fun game if you have friends to play with in a private session. This game is plagued with hackers/modders. If you don't want to risk having your account banned by RockStar for being framed by said hacker for killing an entire lobby under your alias, you can now do everything in a private session. Open sessions are a complete mess, do not play this game in an open session! You run the risk of being Doxed as these hackers can see your IP address while in a session with them."

10650,"The story is goated and if you havent played it yet what are you doing and there are a lot of side missions to complete, but after a bit you'll finish mostly evrything so you try GTA online and you'll find that its a shit fest and get killed within the first 15 mins but a level 235 on a floating bike that shoots missels. But you'll complete a couple of jobs get some money and get a car or 2 and youll get hooked but your passion for it starts to die down and you eventually come back evry couple weeks just to fuck around. Overall good game."

"
10678,"[b]TL;DR - One of the best single-player games. I did not enjoy the multiplayer because of hackers and disconnects. [/b] 

An amazing single-player campaign story. This is the best Grand Theft Auto game I've experienced so far. The characters and missions are well written and the game looks gorgeous. The heists and few other missions are innovative and memorable. The addition of First Person Mode is just brilliant. GTA V graphics are highly customizable, allowing both potato PCs and high end ones to experience the game. The tiny details and the vast amount of side activities like Tennis, Triathlons, Investing in Stock Market, to name a few, can absorb you into playing this game forever. It's got everything you'd expect from a GTA game and so much more. 

I can't speak for GTA Online because I haven't played it much but enough to know that every online game is filled with at least one hacker who one-shots you for no reason. I guess it would be fun to play with friends. There was just too much waiting time for jobs to start and I'd get disconnected often even though my internet connection is decent. Character customization is fun and there's a billion different things to buy, customize and do in GTA Online and it has way more stuff and mechanics than the single-player game. Maybe in the future I'd get to enjoy the multiplayer for what it is, or maybe it'll be time to play the next GTA."

10721,"The story is a 10/10, if you're playing just for the story then I would highly recommend.

As for the online though, it is rampant with modders in almost every session. They will randomly just teleport into your vehicles, make the road slick so you can't drive properly. They'll go into god mode making them impossible to kill, and they'll even drop you money or teleport you to somewhere you don't want to be. I can't believe there is nothing being done about this, really makes it hard to enjoy it properly. I've played this game since it came out on Xbox 360 and seeing it in this state is miserable."

10734,"GTA Story mode has a really good and engaging story worth playing. 

As for the online, the online Gameplay is really engaging too - although, it can get very repetitive once you have done it all. This doesn't stop you from having a great time with friends though and enjoying a good laugh. 

The problem with the Online is modders/cheaters. They literally rule over lobbies causing havoc and chaos 90% of the time and the action taken against them barely exists. To add salt to the wound, I've had friends who have received a ban simply for unknowingly being in a lobby with someone who is modding, likely because modders can unlock items for everyone in the lobby, even if they didn't know or want it in the first place.

I love the game but I'm also very against modding/cheating in online sessions. It's unfair on others and ruins the experience. 

Recommending the game instead of not recommending the game came as a tough choice and I feel I was only able to recommend it due to the availability of invite-only online sessions and the story mode being worth a play. 

If I had been forced to play in only public lobbies, I would unfortunately have to give this a thumbs down. Just something to keep in mind. 

Also, the community is mostly fine in chat, though some people can be extremely toxic. 

I recommend just reporting toxicity in the online environment if you encounter it. Dont bother wasting your time arguing with them as they are likely someone young who has all the time in the world to wind you up."

10813,"You have a 50/50 chance of what kind of multiplayer lobby you get into.
1) A lobby where modders try to stop you from leaving your apartment and drop money for themselves with people begging them to give them money

2) A lobby with a bored dude who decides to ruin other people's days

How to avoid this? Task Manager > Resource Manager > GTA V > Suspend Process for 15 seconds > GTA V > Resume process. Enjoy the solo public lobby.

Another way to avoid this? Play the focused-on-details, great story mode on GTA V.

Michael - Typical high-class old guy with anger issues

Franklin - A guy trying to gain some clout through the most inefficient methods possible

Trevor - Michael in a nutshell minus the high-class part and worse anger issues.

GTA Online character - Guy who gets spammed with calls by Paige Harris, and some other guys persuading him/her to buy some foreclosure."

10962,"Hmmm im not sure if gta 6 will come out. I think rust is a good game. hmmmm yes
"
10963,"The best GTA game ever, which is why I have bought the game three times. But it is still a GTA game, so between the three games for three systems I have less than 20 hours.

It has everything you would expect from a GTA game: great humor, great music, great gun play. And tons of cars to steal, drive, or crash. The map is huge. The characters are bigger than life. It even has online play if that is your sort of thing. The one time I went online my character was shot dead in the street by some ass strafing the street from a fighter. So that wasn't very fun. Still, the online element has been going strong and has been steadily updated. 


Want some details? I can't give you too many as far as the story goes. Most of my time in the game was spent watching the mock shows, or driving the mock freeways. The few hours i actually spent on the main story were spent switching between three characters and doing a few jobs before going back to the driving and tv watching. 

Actually, I am not sure I would call them characters. More like stereotypes: the black gangbanger, the Italian mob man, the white trash meth-head. Did I find any of them like-able? Not really, though the black gang banger came close. I would have preferred making my own character. Even having to pick one of the three would have been better than being forced to play certain characters at certain times. I really hated this game mechanic. But GTA has always done this with their games, making you play a pre-made character for a linear story. With three characters they were able to make a broader and larger story. But I never play game for story. 

Still the game is quite an accomplishment. The city is huge, diverse, and quite beautiful. It made driving real enjoyable. The music selection is excellent. You can even listen to jazz if you like. Real top tier jazz like Sonny Rollins or Count Basie. Even the talk radio is fun. There are activities to occupy your in game leisure. Even buy businesses. Just don't expect a real open world. No crafting, no perks, limited character customization,  few building that can be entered. 


conclusion: 

do you like GTA? You should love this one. Even if you don't like GTA you should find something fun to do. I did. Since it has been around for so long you should be able to get it for a few Eddies."

10984,"Story Gameplay I don't care for much. Online play is fun when its Friends or Crew only. Which, lots of people don't realise they can do. You need to load into the story mode first, then go online from the pause menu and select ""Friends only server"". Great times online with my crew & friends."

However, if you switch to multiplayer, if you don't host a private server with your friends or just play in a solo session, you'll more likely than not encounter hackers that will lock you in one place for a long time or do other stuff that apparently just flies over the devs' heads. This game really shouldn't have made it all the way to this current generation of consoles. Personally, what I've seen the multiplayer actually offer bar the hackers just doesn't seem appealing to me. If you have a group of friends to play the multiplayer with, I'm sure you can get some good enjoyment out of this."

11162,"Rockstar pretty much rigs online to force you to buy shark cards
starting without the criminal enterprise starter pack is going to be awful since you start from scratch so that's money right there after you spend $10 on the starter pack, you can do cargo missions which is way too little pay out for a lot of work. plus selling it at the end can lose you hours of time, so you better do the solo public session glitch to not get griefed by other players. If players taking it away isn't bad enough, you also have the most bullshit plane delivery missions imaginable.
most of the missions require an oppressor mk2 which is 5mil $70
to start making alot of money I recommend buying the Kosatka 2.2mil and spamming cayo perico heist which makes a ton of money.
unfortunately the sub costs around 20 hrs  of cargo head trauma or around $30 
so yeah it's a really really fun game but god rockstar is such a shitty company :p

11200,"This is my third time buying GTA V. I remember having an absolute blast with it when it first came out, and I enjoyed fooling around with the first person mode on PS4. After seeing it drop to a mere 5 bucks or so during the most recent sale, I figured I'd go back in to mess around in GTA Online. To be clear, if you haven't played the GTAV campaign, you should. I'm focused on GTAO here.

GTAO is kind of a mess, y'all.

After the initial server issues that plagued GTAO at launch, I remember it being pretty much what I expected. You could roam around and do dumb stuff with randos, or go into a matchmade game and get a bit sweaty. The whole ""simulation"" bit was easily ignored.

Current GTAO really, really wants you to care about everything surronding that act of playing the game, and that's a bummer, because that stuff isn't fun. I don't want to sit through the same long cutscene every time I try to play a heist. Sometimes the game will allow you to skip the ""drive here"" part of the ""drive somewhere and shoot guys"" routine, but you have to have already completed the mission. Otherwise, you get to sit through whatever boring dialogue they wrote for you.

This would be problematic even if the writing was entertaining, but it's not. It's run of the mill and pales in comparison to anything in Rockstar's past.  And you have the distinct privilege of hearing it all the goddamn time. Even when you get to the ""shoot dudes"" part, you might have control taken away so they can slowly show you a bunch of things you already know and understand. I would wager you spend a good 15 seconds staring at each individual thing they show you.

When I actually get to play GTAO, I have a good time. Too much of GTAO is spent with mindless garbage I don't care about. How people have spent hundreds of hours on this suddenly seems less outrageous, because they spend at least half that time watching bad cutscenes."

11237,"The strip club is very weird. I went into the place to look for my hot babe Carla, but she was missing. The game told me she was online and in the strip club, but I could not find her anywhere. Therefore the only logical explanation was that she got kidnapped. I went out on a journey to extricate her from the peril that had her captive. Alas, I failed even at that. I found out weeks later that Carla had married a new man, after she told me I was her one and only beloved. I cried, that hurt. Then, wouldn't you know it, this game came out with an update. Carla was back! My beloved was back and she forgot about her husband. Let's just say things went well for me ;) I wanted to ask her to marry me again and be mine forever, but I thought that might jog her memory of her husband and she'd leave me again. I did not want that. So, I kept it secret for about 2 months from my girl friend that I was dating Carla and I kept it a secret from Carla that she had a husband. Eventually, Carla's husband, Steven, found her and I had nothing to say. I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. Steven beat the shit out of me as I bawled and tried to dial 9-1-1. Steven took my phone and smashed it. It had all my pictures of Carla on it. I then woke up in the hospital. There, they notified me that I had  6 broken ribs and internal bleeding. They also informed me of my liver, lung, prostate, and brain cancer. Apparently, it is too far in. I was told I had 7 months to live, give or take. I am now living the rest of my life playing Grand Theft Auto V for fun until Gustavo Fring asks me to make methamphetamine for him so I can give my girlfriend some serious cash when I pass. In all, I give this game an 8/10. Enjoy!"

Everything is extremely overpriced which makes the early levels difficult, especially if you get trouble with other players, and it takes a good long while to get anywhere.

11455,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing GTA V. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 18 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

11603,"As a modern urban city sandbox this is still pretty much unmatched. The city just makes sense as a space, it¬¥s interactive, it¬¥s populated, it really feels alive and most importantly it is fun to traverse and explore. There¬¥s a crazy number of activities to partake in, you are sure to find something interesting there, and the famous GTA mayhem is as fun as ever. The shooting is ok, standard third person cover action, nothing special there. The driving is simply excellent, you are going to be driving a lot in this game, and it manages to always be engaging.

I‚Äôm not as fond of the story sadly. The main trio is very well realized and compliment each other wonderfully. All the systems introduced to make playing with three characters at once while also making them feel like individual characters work flawlessly. It¬¥s just the narrative and its structure that doesn¬¥t quite feel as polished as the other elements of the game. The plot is technically moving along, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like it goes anywhere or that there is any reason behind the things that are happening. It lacks some major end goal or evolution in its characters and story that leaves it feeling aimless and like doing a set of chores. I can‚Äôt help but compare it to Red Dead Redemption 2, which I believe is a way better game in pretty much every sense, where there always was something to look ahead for, plenty of unexpected surprises, and honestly, the strength of the writing and characters held up any sequences that might feel a bit lackluster in comparison. Here it seems like they are hiding behind the irreverent tone and jokey satire to not really develop much of anything, and the comedy and satire are not nearly as solid as they should be to carry the momentum all by themselves. It starts strong, but it just becomes more of the same as it goes along, never really surprising the player nor justifying itself. I also played a bunch of the side missions and while they have some interesting moments, they don‚Äôt really amount to much sadly.

I¬¥m not even remotely interested in trying out the Online component.

Amazing city sandbox, not so great story, you probably have already played this, so you know it already."

if you want to be frustrated by some glitch that happens out of thin air making you fail a mission you put hours into, resulting in you having to start over the entire thing (if you don't get stuck in a black screen).

If not in a mission you can always freeroam in the california weather, sunny with a slight chance of flying bikes with missiles.

11874,"Overrated. The story isn't as well written or fleshed out like that of GTAIV. That being said much like the last game, GTAV's ending is as rushed and underwhelming as the last. The game peaks at the last heist. Just like the last game, the game's main antagonists are far from memorable, I can't even remember their names, and the side characters often are more prominent then them as the story progresses. After beating the game I don't think I'll ever be coming back to it again. Rockstar never supported this game's single player with DLC like GTAIV and exclusively focused on the online portion, which is not why I purchased the game. I can't recommend this game if you played previous GTAs, especially if you wanted a memorable story."

11907,"GTA 5 is one of my most played games ever. The single player story mode has maybe a couple dozen hours worth of game play if your are a completionist. 

The main game play comes from GTA Online. The online has an unbelievable amount of content. So much so that much of it has slowly gone by the wayside and isn't played anymore. Rockstar took a shot at reintroducing the player base to some of that content with the Criminal Enterprises update. Be careful not to make the game into a job. A lot of the GTA Online content can seem like a grind for money. And if you let yourself get into that sort of mindset it can be easy to burn out quickly. Remember this is a game and is supposed to be fun.

In general this game is absolutely worth the money. You will probably get another 2 years at least before GTA 6 would make this game obsolete. That is plenty of time to get your money's worth"

11941,"still full of bugs and glitches even after 9 years, can't play more than 20 minutes without having a problem."
11942,"So the way this game is setup is that instead of a server that everyone connects to, the GTA Online lobbies are P2P mesh infrastructure. This means that everyone else will just accept what you say happened. If you say you have infinite health, other computers will accept that. If you say you teleported across the map, they will accept that. That's why the modders are able to do all that weird stuff like fly cars, teleport around the map, and kill you from across the map. 

Good news is there's also bugs that you can exploit to get an empty public lobby, but it shouldn't be this way.

Still a fun game though."

Sure the game can be annoying when you come across a troller or modder/hacker but if you can find someone nice and chill then you wont regret playing this game.Plus, don't buy on epic games, it cost $30 while you can buy it here for $15 and there is no difference."

Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat.
Add oil to the hot skillet and add steak when it begins to smoke.
Sear the steak for 2 minutes for the first side. Flip and sear 2 minutes.
Add minced garlic, butter and fresh rosemary.
Transfer the steak to a preheated oven at 425¬∞F (218¬∞C).

12031,"I curse the day I bought this garbage game on. The game is always in offline mode, and Cockstar's garbage launcher is constantly fuqing me in the azz, fuq this game, not buying gta 6 if it's coming with this trash launcher, fuq Rockstar Services as well!

------------------------------------------

It's funny how Steam (Which has absolutely nothing to do with my problems with this game) is asking me to review this game again after it had crashed for the 10th time in a row, or how it's taking me 30 minutes on average to get into a public session, (yeah I fixed the problem with the client's token, but it comes back if I restart my PC or my Router, which means it's not a perfect solution).

And if I was lucky to get into a game, I get bombarded with messages from people who don't play the game at all and spend their entire time advertising scams; and I'm very sure these people are bots.

------------------------------------------

Rockstar is on the down hill road (like Blizzard) and they are falling fast, most of the top brains that created, developed and nurtured the GTA franchise have left the company, no wonder RDR2, GTA5 and Online are in this garbage state."

Then they did the bait and switch on a lot of us people that bought the game and DLC is only for online. So if you're getting this for single player you're just getting vanilla and that's it. The other 60% of the content is for online they're getting all the updates and there is reported of shady business practice from this company. I myself stay away from online so none of these shady things happened to me yet. But as I stated I'm only play the single player and I was not too impressed with it."

If you're buying this for modded single-player, expect to be very annoyed about every two to three weeks."
12153,"20 years ago people thought we would have flying cars but no, we have GTA V. 

This is the place where grown men pretend to be teenage girls.

This is the place where people find each other in their oppresssor mk. 2s and constantly kill each other.

This is a place where people get online bullied.

This is the place where people accidentaly kill each other and start wars with each other and invite their friends to help them beat the shit out of the other person.

Would reccomend. 10/10 gaming experience."

Pretty much exclusively playing the Online version. Can be very ""interesting"" at times.  I have linked up with people via Social Club to communicate, perform missions together.

I've logged over 450 hours in this game. Still have ""very"" little idea of what I'm doing, but ultimately enjoying the ride."

12284,"This went from being my favorite game to my most hated, and it all boils down to Rockstar's terrible decision making and total neglect for anything other than cashing in on it's patsies. 

After 7 years of grinding, paying real actual money just to have a competitive edge in a game absolutely lousy with cheaters blowing you up the moment you spawn, my character is erroneously deleted. I spent hours trying to find out why from R* support only to be told that the decision was irreversible and that i had ""broken a rule "". They of course neglected to tell me which rule because I never once cheated. Meanwhile other players are making bags of money rain from the sky, blowing people up repeatedly,  teleporting, and ruining legitimate players experience with zero consequences. I really  enjoyed the fact that my account was deleted as part of a mass deletion with no investigation, or evidence of any wrong doing. During the hight of the pandemic, and using gta as an escape from reality. I invested hundreds of dollars to enjoy the new ""content"" just days before my account was deleted.

I know this turned into an incoherent rant, but after two years I am still poisoned on this game and probably any future Rockstar titles to come. I know I won't be buying gta v a 5th time...

As a cheater you have a kind of a God Mode where you make other player's lives a living hell. You can always enter a new session if things are getting too difficult but it's pretty annoying. 

Other than this, I frequently have problems with the session when I want to play with my friends. Yesterday we where in the middle of a prep for a heist and basically I was moved to an empty session without knowing (no load screen, no nothing) and me continuing the mission. It happens more often than I would like.

All in all, the things I said above doesn't affect at all the fact that the game is fantastic."

12353,"I have had this game for Over 5 years on Xbox. Bought this game in July on PC when it was on sale. Looks better, and I do enjoy some of the things I can do on PC that I cant on Xbox. Since the DLC came out it is better to play solo and do small things without getting killed all the time. But the DLC also works on Xbox so I am back and forth. If you play Solo, you like game better. If you like playing with friends, or with others its the same, just watch out for people who Hack, and alot of Spammers. Only bad thing is I cant MOD in online, only in offline play. But have learned to use My music instead of listening to the games music. Worth buying? Yea, if you get it on sale."

12405,This is a really good game one of my childhood games
12406,mid update makes you buy a mod menu and or a vpn to play the game in public sessions as people can easily grab your ip or crash your game and they are only your real way of protecting yourself as for a long time until this update they didn't allow you to sell in invite only sessions.
12407,.
12408,"They ban people for simply being in the same server as a modder, making Stalin's purges look like nothing.

The game is also plagued with... disagreeable people, who go out of their way to ruin peoples games, but with the new introduction of being able to grind in private lobbies it has put a stop to that.

The game is very grindy, I won't lie, and you are slightly encouraged to pay to win, but, in my opinion, you don't have to buy shark cards to progress in the game.

It's alright I guess. It was extremely scummy how they fucked over the modding community but other than that, the game is fine."

12421,"Singleplayer story was quite good, had a bit of a slower start and lost my interest for a while but I'm glad I went back to finish it. GTA online is arguably the best game I've ever played and undoubtedly one of the best games to ever be released, it'll take you over a thousand hours to unlock most things, and there's regular updates so there's always something new to work towards. If you like progression and grinding to get stuff then this game's for you. Playing the casino heist for the 100th time can get a little boring, but theres an almost infinite list of missions and gamemodes to play. Playing with friends in voice calls makes this game very enjoyable, and it's still very fun playing with randoms on your own, provided you avoid getting griefed by flying motorbikes with missles constantly."

Every player is 10 or 45 and cant afford milk so they still live with mom. I LOVE the infinite loading screens, the cheaters, no customer service, and toxic players. Their service is as useful as a 6 year old girl with polio in a boxing match. This game also helps people do things they cant do irl like making friends and talking to girls. Yet people come running for this game like nikocado avocado for a big mac. I will still rate this LOADING SCREEN SIMULATOR 10/10"

12449,"This game is the most pay to win, grindy, money hungry, dogshit piece of software ever created by mankind. The thrilling gameplay of grand theft auto online includes spending 20 hours grinding for money so that you may purchase a submarine or arcade or whatever, which you will then use to grind for another 20 hours for more money so that you may have any fun in this $30 video game, or you can buy rockstar's glorious shark cards for another 20$ or more to bypass that process entirely, and then go blow up a bunch of level 1 players with your missile shooting jet bike. In case you ever wonder why rockstar has not made another gta game in 12 years, it's because they're too busy sucking every red cent out of people's wallets through this piece of shit game.  I wouldn't touch this fucking game again if you paid me to. I'm trying to save you money and many wasted hours that you could be spending doing literally anything else. If you're thinking of buying this game, do not."

Playing in invite only's won't help if you're targeted. Rockstar will gladly press charges on devs making mods for single player or for older gtas (mostly to protect their garbage enhanced edition) but won't do shit to actual criminals. Red dead died for this. Don't buy it for it's single player either, pirate it. Each update gets worse and worse, and their only reaction is to put bandaids on cuts when the rest of the game is full of compact fractures and lacerations."

12592,its trash purchased the premium version for like $40 and was so ready to play then try to load in and out of the the 5 or 6 times i try i finally get in and find out i have no dlc stuff that came with it or the huge amount of money thats supposed to come with the whale shark card thats included so i recommend just saving your money and wasting on gta 6 when they finally decide to release that because we all know its just gonna be a big disappointment like all of there other games

GTA V (Grand Theft Auto V) is top class

12616,"In short (for now): yes, I would recommend this game. The story mode (singleplayer) is excellent and the online mode can be fun as well.

Outside of replaying the story and getting a 100% completion rate on the game most of the longevity lies in the online mode. Keeping this short as well for now.. the game in its current state does not come close to the potential it had right from the start, with many possibilities for small changes and additions that could have greatly improved the overall experience.
The game design choices and philosophies are questionable at best to downright awful and illogical, which has frustrated players in public sessions (which up until recently were required for what would be considered PvE content) for years on end.

But with all that said, in either singleplayer or online mode GTA V is still a great open world game if you like just roaming around and having silly fun in a sandbox type environment."

12635,"Terrible online mode, which is the soul purpose why I am disliking this game. 

Back in 2016 this game was a masterpiece on ps4, when the pc release came out I ported over just to find it a cheating mess. heres the catch, that move was permanent and I was not allowed to move it back. Modders came back within 24 Hours of the update release on 7/27/2022 I want steam to takedown this game, there are reports of people pulling IP addresses and video evidence on youtube. Steam its about time you take some responsibility, is that too much to ask? Gabe Newel said his email address is public when he was giving out the new handheld device, but the steam store needs to learn even AAA Titles are corrupt, and valve knows this. If you cant be bothered to fix team fortress two, at least fix your storefront, the thing that made you the company you are. and Rockstar I have almost zero words other than stop being greedy, you just lie and cheat and steal, the modders get banned, you destroy people's lives when IP's get pulled in lobbies because your stuck in peer to peer, this isn't online, its glorified java exploiting. Get your act together r* and Steam, or I'll have you know since this account was made when I was a kid, and everytime your platform(s) take a step forward, they take three steps back. absolutely terrible game, absolutely terrible support, absolutely terrible platform. Absolutely disgusting that this is still on here when hackers come back so fast pulling IP's and scaring anyone, as a reminder, ESRB doesn't rate online interactions, but pulling IP's in public peer to peer, thats steams problem too by letting it be on the store."

12643,"They abandoned Red Dead Redemption. Keep taking Todd Howard's Skyrim approach on GTA V and yet it's still a terrible game that just needs to end. Literally kicking a dead horse now. Get on that GTA VI and keep Red Dead Redemption 2 updated with good content and not lying disastrous trickle updates that add nothing. Where in the hell is the first Red Dead Redemption that was supposed to finally come to PC. GTA used to be about the good crazy long plots of the STORY not this over saturated kettle of shit called online. Online has it's place if it's done right. So far between GTA V and RDR2, they haven't figured anything out other than how to create a massive hacker playground and scam gullible people into buying shit outright vs spending your life doing it the grind way only to realize there was no content worth that time waste and regret living. Eat the corn out of my $h!t, Rockstar. Fucking disaster of a company. Facts."

12710,"Lemme start this by saying that GTA more specifically GTA Online is great, probably one of the best games of all time and I would totally recommend this game to anyone, if you're on console. Seriously do NOT get this game on PC, public lobbies are full of hackers and modders who will either crash your game or worse will provide you with cash or RP. Unfortunately Rockstar's anti-cheat system can't tell the difference between a modder and a player who received modded money and this has led to my second, and permanent ban. Once again I want to reiterate that GTA is amazing and I have played countless hours of this on Xbox, but I implore you to go play it on console and not here to avoid the same isues I and so many others have gone through."

12771,"Shit, shit, shit, everything imaginable becomes a hassle when you play this game. Yes, its a fun game, yes, it's unique, and no, my review doesn't matter to you anyway. But I'll say this anyway. This game's online mode is filled with bugs and problems. Try to enter your cargo crate warehouse, stuck in an infinite loading screen, try to drive to Mount Chilliad and scale it with friends? Sorry, Rockstar game services are unavailable. Can we the players catch a break? I mean, we are the only ones keeping the game alive long enough to rack in millions while we are deprived of what we payed for. I've bought this game 2 times so far, once on xbox and another on this steam account, when I tried to transfer my account from xbox to here it wouldn't let me. One of the main reasons why I switched to PC has been absolutely destroyed. But look no further! Rockstar Support has your back! Nope. They refused to transfer my account which I have spent countless hours and hundreds of dollars on, but hey at least I get to keep the 10 dollar shitty criminal enterprise starter pack cars huh. Well I'm never spending a single dollar on this game ever again and neither should you, in fact you shouldn't even spend the 20 dollars to get this game. Instead, I encourage you to find a different game or wait until GTA6 comes out. Maybe it will be good, maybe it will be bad, I guess we have to wait and find out. In case you are wondering, I'm writing this review after my 6th time restarting my game because of a bug TODAY. Unless this game company that cares so little about their player-base decides to fix their shit and try to salvage this game back to the masterpiece it once was, I encourage you to stay away. It's for the better."

Played for another 100 hours without hacking ONCE, get PERMANENTLY BANNED with 0 reason given, 0 chance to appeal it, on their website it states, ""all ban decisions are final and cannot be appealed"", their support E-mail and phone line are both now automated messages saying to use the support portal on their website that leads to the screen where they say bans are final. Meanwhile I have friends who've been hacking nonstop on this game for MONTHS with 0 repercussions. Do not support Rockstar, this game is almost 10 years old but people still play it and they need to stop supporting such a scummy company. If you want the online experience of GTA, play FiveM or some other private server, do NOT play on Rockstar servers and definitely do NOT buy Shark Cards."

12834,"""Grand Theft Auto 5 is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA 4 brought to the table five years ago. It‚Äôs technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but it‚Äôs also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed adventures through San Andreas.

It is one of the very best video games ever made.

That‚Äôs still where we stand on it today. And whether you agree that it‚Äôs a masterpiece or not, the PC version is definitely the best way to play GTA 5. Developer Rockstar has taken full advantage of the technical power of the platform, and made GTA feel right at home here. It‚Äôs well optimized, and the frame rate and resolution will go as high as your hardware can handle ‚Äì including 4K/UHD resolutions and multi-display setups. Maxed out, the enormous and incredibly detailed open-world region of San Andreas looks more amazing than ever, thanks to long draw distances and enhanced effects. This is the only place you can play GTA 5 at 60 frames per second (or higher), and with all the high-speed driving and shooting, it definitely benefits from that smoothness. "" 

This is how IGN reviews this game and I cant agree more with it. This game was made at the pinacle of console gaming and although thanks to the opressor mark 2 it isnt enjoyable as much anymore and 4/5 people you encounter being modders is kind of annoying it still is fun to hop on occasionally and have fun with friends."
12835,"stop milking gta 5
love story, hate online.
you need 3 friends which you will NOT make in online (everyone hates eachother and the likelyhood of finding any friendly player is slim to none), the ways to progress in online are extremely repetitive and not fun, it feels like rockstar is just begging you to buy shark cards to progress. hackers rule every lobby and rockstar doesn't do shit about it, playing online is more of a risk than any sort of reward you can get out of it now due to any snotty 12 year old with a mod menu can grab your IP and get your account terminated. buy for the story, not online.

story is beautiful on the other hand, wonderfully crafted, enjoyable and easy to follow, the combat is fun and clearly had way more passion, care, and love put into it than online. i am only recommending gta due to the story, online on its own is not enjoyable and wants you to play in a very specific way if you want to progress at all."

12916,"Playing GTA V is kinda fun, but the main problem is having to grind to have fun with friends, or just use 500$ of your money to stay up and be rich, so you can have fun, its way better to play with friends than by yourself. One of my friends bought me this game, so I intend to play some of this game keep the grind so i can have money on hand, but the games economy is so shit things rise in price while shark cards price never increase or decrease its, so you have to options GRIND and WASTE TIME or WASTE MONEY. they just need to make a little bits of tweaks here and there and make the game better"

If you do story mode but get bored or lonely you can play online with others to either fight, steal, or do races and challenges. This game allows friends as well but I play on PC while most of my friends play on Xbox or Playstaion and GTA is not cross-platform.

13242,"A comprehensive guide to not get banned from the online play.
1. If you see a hacker in an open session, find a new session. There's too many ways that will get you all fucked up.
2. If your matchmaking teammate went all superman and flash in missions. Kill yourself and vote to quit. 
3. If hackers are killing you, don't fight back, change sessions.
4. If you get a warning saying connection to Rockstar social club can't be maintained. Switch back to Michael and try to join a new session, don't do any shit that will reward you GTA$ because those $ will be categorized by the amazingly wrote algorithm by the wonderful hands of the adorable programmers from RockStar as illegitimate earns. Yeah the server sucks, but apparently that's on us.
5. If you pick up $ dropped by the hackers, that's illegitimate earns.
6. If you sit in your teammates car and he starts to teleport, jump off the car and kill yourself.
7. Pray your game never crashes during shit, especially during the cut-scenes before payout in heists. Because if your game do crashes, the game will bug, you'll find the $ in your account when you log back on. But you can start the finale again, without any preps, you will still get rewarded if you do the finale again. But hell, yeah, you guessed it, that $ is illegitimate earns. This is a horrible game bug, instead of fixing the bug, they fix you.
8. To sum up, to play this game without getting banned. You need to have a state of the art connection that never gets you d/ced from the game during game play. You need to run away from hackers when you see one and never never have any kind of interactions with them. You need to pay attention to what your matchmaking teammate is doing, if he appears to be a god, and you finish this mission/heist, you're fucked. And yeah, pray that your game never crashes. 

What happened to me?
I purchased this game, and paid for the starter pack to play with two of my friends.
One of them paid for shark cards to get ahead so he can carry the rest of us.
When we had the $ to purchase our own Kosatka, I spend 20 hours to try to figure out how to play solo Perico better. And spend another 50 hours or so grinding the heist for $ so my friend won't be carry all the burdens himself. I did all those solo by hand, that means it takes me more than one hour to finish the entire prep-heist. At the end I got better and the whole thing takes around 45 minutes.
I purchased the business for my MC club, got the upgrades for my nightclubs, got myself a Toreado, things are getting really better and I was having a lot of fun with my friends.
On 24 July, our matchmaking teammate in the prep mission for the Standard Pacific heist was a hacker. We didn't find out until he starts to teleport and hover in mid-air and explodes every hostile vehicle that spawns. The mission was a success before we know it. 
Another matchmaking teammate appears to be a hacker in one of our finale in the old heists series, because apparently, he is level 4000. He spawned a car in the mission that was not supposed to be possible. We sat in the car, that's when he teleport us straight to the objective and finished the heist under 1 min. We got a warning and we didn't get any $ in that finale.
I purchased the facility to get access to the doomsday heists. We were getting a hard time joining in the same session to do the prep mission that can only be done in public sessions. I paid the set up fee for one of them, and spend 2 hours to do the rest of it myself because of the poor server. And the fact we will join a new session each time when we finish a prep mission and it's in the god's hand that we will end up in the same session. After the 2-3 hours prep phase, we did the finale, and thank god we can do it as a team of 3. But hell, my game crashed at the cut-scene before payout. When I log back on and try to start the prep missions for dooms day part 2, the prep screen is still on the finale for part 1. We did it again just so we can get to part 2, $ was rewarded despite we all thought we'd get nothing. Since a couple of my solo Perico didn't get me any $, we all thought it's a game bug or mechanics. 
On 25 July, we were trying to get to a public session with fewer players so our selling convoy won't have to be blown to pieces by others. We found one session with under 10 and we all joined that one. And we soon found out why this session was less-populated. There was this hacker that just teleport to your back and one-shot you regardless of your armor and what kind of vehicle you were in. He just kills someone and teleport to the next, we had to switch to passive mode to survive. People are leaving because of him and we figured we'd soon have a public to ourselves if he keeps killing. We waited for a few minutes before everyone was pissed and leaves. I took advantage of the waiting and reported the hacker, and that's the first time I found the functionality.
We did a couple of other activities that day, I did all the prep missions and went solo Perico again, I got a message saying a connection with Rockstar social club can't be maintained before the finale and I got nothing from the finale. I was pissed and left my character in the surveillance room of my Kosatka in a invitation only session to allow my nightclub to generate income, and left home for a movie.
When I return, a message was shown on the screen that I'm suspended for 30 days starting from July 24 until 24 August and my character is reset. 
I am contacting the support team of Rockstar by email to make an appeal, because they are just so arrogant and proud that they assume all their bans were issued justly and removed the appeal function on their support page, plus their phone redirects you to that page and no one will talk to you. 
I spent a solid 200 hours in the online play for the past 2-3 weeks. All my gains were hard-earned. I did not use any suspicious tools, didn't speak up a lot in the public chat, didn't use any bugs in the game. When someone kills me, I'll just respawn and run away. And I spend a fair share of my time gets blown to bits by hackers in public sessions. And I am the one suspended, on top of that, my character is wiped clean.
I spend the last 12 hours just trying to figure out the analogy and the logic behind all this. And this is what I can get from my end of perspective from a retrospective view, as we have absolutely zero knowledge of what matchmaking teammate can do. All my efforts and 200 hours of my memories with my friends are now gone. And there is no place for a player like me to make an appeal.
I don't know how Rockstar can be as arrogant and ignorant as this. And the fact that this can totally happen again even if I accept this shit and start over, and all my hard-earned stuff will have a fair chance to be taken away again easily by the Publisher that I once thought marks the top standard of the industry just stops all my urges to play anymore.

I can't speak for other people, and I will not answer to ""you're making up stories to cover yourself up, you hacker"". But if my suspension is not lifted and my character is not restored.
I will not spend another cent in any future games of all the titles of Rockstar Games. 
This is hardly a threat since my money is just one bit of dust compared to all the money the company makes. 
But this marks my attitude, my disappointment of a fan, and if the appeal is not successful, the tombstone of my character and memories.

0/10 will purchase again. 

Read from my experience, learn if you don't already know, and stay alerted or just stay away from the online play my fellow players."

"
13254,"Rockstar have gone the route of Shark Cards. Red Dead is no longer supported, GTAO is more about how much irl cash you can spend than actual skill, cheaters are constant, bans are random, and Rockstar doesn't care. They just care that this game is still a cash cow. I will not be supporting GTAVI no matter what kind of hype it garners. It'll most certainly be another attempt at a cash cow, coated in MTX and P2W crap so Rockstar can get as much money as they can get their greedy little hands on."

I completed a few missions, then when I tried to load my save game it loaded me into the Online game. I quit out of the character creator and it popped me to my save spot. GREAT! Only the game was frozen and after a minute went back to the online character creator. Done this 5 times now. Cold boot, everything!

The online community cheats in ways that completely kill the fun of the game. If they get annoyed with you, players will throw dozens of busses on your head or make it so any vehicle you enter moves like its driving through molasses.

Because not letting innocent people who were affected by this to get a chance to speak for themselves is a way to lose players and money. I hope GTA 6 fails.

 The modders have no reason at all to kill you. I'm always on there to do missions, so whenever they kill me it's just interfering with me completing a mission.

 The spam bots just tell you to go buy illegal funds or level ups from their discord servers... they spam it about 1000 times. It's ridiculous and fills up the players chat.

13468,"this game used to be so fun.. spending hours on end grinding this game to buy the coolest car, best house, play the dope heists and all in all just enjoy the open world game where you can do whatever you want. but the modders are OUT OF CONTROL. every. single. lobby. is filled with hackers. You'll be doing your own thing then out the blue some guy is just teleporting on top of you. you try to kill him but no he has godmode. You call them out in chat and all they do is crash your game or STEAL YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY just with a click of a button. it amazes me how R* is always putting out updates for this game but cant seem to fix or at least ban the modders that play. i dont understand how R* can continue to update this game and not do anything to fix this issue. ITS EVERY GAME. i stopped playing for awhile and just picked it back up, 5/5 lobbys i've played has been just kids spamming their mods to mess with other players and get them mad. this game HAD so much to it but it really pisses me off with how much time and effort i've put into this game and it can all be taken away but some kids with mod menus. please dont buy this game even if its $10. you will never be able to find a peaceful lobby with chill players unless its private. Sorry for the long rant but just lobby after lobby this game grinds my gears with the bullsh*t that these ""devs"" ignore. i feel sorry for people buying sharkcards just for a modder to steal the money.. its insane how downhill this game has came.

13476,"The time displayed is not accurate to my time in GTA V, I have played 8 thousand hours, rockstar won't stop letting me down. This game needs a economy rework, bank heist should be useable in freeroam. The assets from RDR2 should have been in the next gen versions. They didn't even bother to add the RDR2 fighting mechanics to GTA 5, imagine a lasso? stuff people into your cars trunk. The amazing volumetric clouds from RDR2 don't exist here, I thought at the very least in GTA 5 next gen those clouds would've been included, all I wanted was to fly my airplane through those clouds in dogfights, but no. I understand these things are time consuming, but how does a 2018 release look superior to a 2022 release? The water physics from RDR2? Nope. The amazing animations? Nope. Carrying bodies? Nope. All this tells me is GTA 6 will look like RDR2, when GTA5 should look like it since you justified rereleasing it. Gamings biggest tragedy is that rockstar is owned by Take2 interactive, the same company who owns the NBA games. I hope you can see the problem. 


GTA 6, Hire the beamNg staff to work with you guys. It would be amazing,  imagine, police are hot on your tail and you hop into a Espernero and attempt a getaway. You crash into a tree, the entire front end is smashed, you bail out and find another car. It is possible, BeamNG was released in 2013. Foliage, do it better than the rest. Burnable, curshable. Semi cabs, i want to feel the weight, i want to see the cab jiggle. Mafia 3 did it/ (2016) 
vehicles in GTA V look great, they don't have much going on. Reminds me of toy cars, no window wipers, Forza 3 did it. (2016) No excuses. This was next gen. Rockstar is the leader of the gaming world. please start acting like it.
These new updates to the PS5 versions would be added to PC at a later date. 

Rockstar released the trilogy in the state they did. Trust me, if I worked at rockstar I would blow all of your minds. But, we live on earth, our leaders, even in gaming suck."
13477,"Im writing this review as a player who has played gta online for a few thousand hours. This game would be a solid 9.5/10 if rockstar would do something productive about modders and exploiters. Even reporting hundreds of confirmed modders, I still seem to find these players unbanned in public lobbies weeks later. It has gotten to the point where I expect at least 1-2 modders per session. They can track your IP address(fact), crash your game, or make your character explode remotely from any location on the map. In the current state of gta online, I cant in good conscience recommend this game to anyone. This coming from someone who has enjoyed nearly all previous gta titles."

13536,","
13537,"WARNING TO NEW/RETURNING PLAYERS: I bought during summer sale and spent days of playtime grinding to lvl 100 in online mode, only to be banned without cause or evidence by Rockstar and my account wiped. Online is full of cheaters and griefers, but it seems the anti-cheat system only catches legitimate players. Would not recommend investing much time into online because false bans cannot be appealed. Your progress is at the mercy of a flawed system, just another aspect of an overall broken game mode. Such great potential here, but some of the worst game management I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing."

 unless you are cheating, or you cheat have the posiblity to render the larger online mode unplayable as you get whats called a ban, some are permanent."

There are a lot of tiny annoyances like characters constantly calling about side quests that arn't much fun. The Champaign isn't much fun either. Multiplayer is just a mess. A lot of stuff in MP is locked behind in game money you can either grind a lot of time for or pay real money for, wich for a 60$ game rubs me the wrong way. I wouldn't recommend."

13600,"Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition on XBOX One X, "" "" Series X and PlayStation 4 - No problem, the game more or less runs flawlessly!

On my Windows 11 PC (AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 6-Core 3.70 GHz / 16GB RAM / Nvidia Geforce RTX 3060) at 800x600 runs (educated guess) between 20-50FPS...  Never mind 1080p - My machine may as well be an Intel 286!
The last I checked those specs weren't exactly Required Minimum and Cyberpunk 2077 (comparatively) runs 1080p max settings with a consistently fluid framerate!
The damn game shows signs of straining the second the Rockstar Logo flash across the screen like you're approaching a black hole!  The main menu has obviously had a metric butt-tonne of graphical pizzazz stuffed into, because I cannot even access anything!  That was until I turned off the antialiasing and dialled the resolution down to 800x600 in the settings XML file!

Bigger better graphics IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER!  Shenanigans like this make me appreciate simple game engine technology all the more!

I'm sorry, this was a good game back in 2013.  The experience was refined into a better game with it's initial remastered release that introduced first-person.  This latest iteration though...  Utter garbage from a technical point of view and shows just how insatiably greedy Take 2 Interactive truly are to pedal something so damn shonky!"

But by all means, you can still have fun with friends in a private lobby.***Warning*** the recent crack-down on modders has only made things worse. There are now tenfold the amount of people with cheap mod menus' so you've been warned to that extent lol. Be prepared to be booted out of a lobby just because someone doesn't want you in it.

13638,"It amazes me what a terrible community this game has.

There are no community events, gatherings when you go online, like in a MMO for example. You have to always be in passive mode and walk around with ghosts if you want to socialize.

This game truly has the biggest degenerates and lowlifes I have ever seen in any game in over 20 years time playing online.

Let me sum up the type of people who play this game:

12 year old kids who think they are owning when they use cheats

Cheaters and modders who do everything to ruin your time, because they can't win without cheating

Kids who think KDA matters and go around killing lvl 20 players 20 times to increase it

People who just shit on others for the fun of it, literally people who are bullies IRL and Rockstar does a good job at promoting this behaviour

Oppressor garbage players who think they are God because they use the most broken vehicle in game

20% of players in every lobby are cheaters, I am not even exaggerating, it is truly mind boggling. I have not even found that many cheaters in any FPS I ever played.

Constant unprovoked random killings, when you are just standing around

dont buy this shit"

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

13654,Never gets boring!
13655,"Suspended and had my character resetted for ZERO REASON. 

(Minor detail,  I've brought the game a long time ago and only started playing recently, about 100 hours total in 2 weeks time. I'm writing this review with a friend's account as the game apparently has been made unavailable in my region.)

I grinded this game hard and legit, over a hundred hours in total under a week, even spend hours doing stupid vehicle cargos and MC businesses, spending hours finding 54 collectible cards and etc, working my way up buying businesses with my money and grinding the cayo heist.

Got in a casino heist with a random one day I added on gta discord group a minute ago and after I failed a hack and set off the alarms he started saying ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• this and turning on god mode and spawning in vehicles and killing all the guards with aimbot.

You can say at this point i should have quit the session and retry with another, and you're probably right. But let me tell you, between the enormous amount of cheater playerbase there is (Probably somewhere over 50%) and the mind-numbing internet issues you encounter to even join a players lobby bug free, yes fkers, I decided to let it play through and just find another player afterwards.

After we've got the mission pass screen, I've landed to another screen, telling me I'm suspended for a month and my character is going to reset. I wouldn't even be too mad except for the part where the cheater that played with me is still playing without getting suspended.

This is literally the shittest feeling ever, having 100 hours of your life just reduce to nothing in just one mission. I've never done anything other than grind missions for the money in this game. Even the cheater that was with me was confused as why that happened, and I can't even sent a ticket in to appeal because apparently all decisions are final.

TL;DR, Do not buy this game if you're either looking to play online, or if you do at least cheat freely knowing you'll have a less chance of getting banned and even if you did you've would have lost nothing because at least you didn't spend hours on the grind."
13656,"So Fun! I remember playing this game and finishing the story in my ps3 then ps4, ps5 and now PC. Cant wait for GTA 6"
13657,great game with and without mods but you might wanna download a mod menu to be able to expand your gta v experience
13658,mod menu heaven
13659,"The game is divided into story mode and online mode
Although the story mode does not have the fancy weapons of the online mode, the plot content is very friendly and comprehensive [Mengxin can try to make money first]
The online mode is very wild. There are plug-ins everywhere and many advertisements, but there are many online game content. Every asset may have tasks for players to complete. You can go anywhere and do whatever you want.
The game is highly playable, and this game seven years ago is still worth buying."
13660,its such a good game i think some missions prep make you drive for abot 20 mins which isnt good
13661,"hate the little stigmu fisices to the game, but after that it's a amazing"
13662,"Storymode is fun. Online.. Well, if you have nothing to do and don't mind staring at a loadingscreen for 30 minutes and have a 50/50 chance of being disconnected in the process, this is the game for you."

GTA used to be playable and one of the most fun games out, now they just want your money and they let the game go to trash. Do NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME. Huge disappointment.

13862,"Boy is this going to be an unpopular opinion but here we go.

The single player story tries to walk a line between wacky and goofy satire while also being super serious crime drama / corrupt american dream and fails to do either with any amount of success. The world itself is massive and yet shallow with nothing to do but a bunch of small and unfun mini-games like yoga, tennis, and et cetera.

The only real fun you'll have is ignoring the story and just enjoying the open world chaos so you'd think by that measure i'd enjoy the online. But in reality the online is so predatory and focused on making money for Rockstar that i'm not even sure I can recommend that in good conscience.

You want a good open world sandbox crime game? Go install Saints Row 2. There are mods that can make it work on modern machines perfectly."

13889,Fantastic since the original release. Would love some 4/20 merch to purchase though.
13890,"online is absolute garbage and rockstar games, you're useless. my account that has earned over $40 million was wiped for NOTHING. (money mostly made from pre-nerfed cayo perico heist). didn't mod, cheat, glitch or any of that shit. i already had everything in the game and had EVERYTHING to lose. i returned to play for a WEEK, i know that they have nothing on me to get an account wipe and month suspension. their support team is non-existent while simultaneously being completely and utterly useless so i can't prove my innocence. thanks for nothing."

13934,I don't know if I got it for free but anyways it was worth however much it costed and the 100gb to download it and installing the stupid DLL to make it run and running it in administrator bypassing steams thing just to make it work so I could play blackjack every couple weeks for half an hour.

13938,from the recent news that rockstar recently made that they rather focus more on GTA online than RDR2 has shown they don't seem to care about them. gta online is full of hackers and modders who will troll you to no end and use dirty tactics to get you banned while they get to go scott free. don't buy this game and express your opinion to them.

14034,"This game should be the definition of rags to riches. (This review is about the online version of this game)
Right off the bat if you didn't buy the criminal enterprise pack then you start with a couple of bucks and a pistol, but the more you play, the more heists/minigames you join, the more you rank up, and the more money you get, you just get more and more powerful. You can go from having a little warehouse with a cheap bike in it, to having a giant apartment with the 10 of the best cars in the game. Play this game, you will enjoy it."

14037,"Good Day.

I will NOT recommend this game to anyone. Do not waste your money or time. The game is fun to play when you play it alone. Meaning Online in a session of your own(very rare), or single player. Then 90% of the game population online is toxic, 90% of the players of the game is Modding online. 90% of the time you get stuck on a loading screen and get dropped. Customer support is Pathetic. Online gaming experience is Pathetic. Players exploiting the game, 100%. GETTING RANDOM SUSPENSIONS, 100%. Do not waste your time playing a game, where the GM's(Pathetic/Useless) Suspend clean players, and allow toxic/modding  players to run around freely. 

WORST EXPERIENCE IN GAMING I HAVE EVER HAD IN THE LAST 20 YEARS.

14039,"The story is fun, with a good map with goods missions.
The online is the worst experience i've ever had playing a game, no anti cheat, matchmaking is nonexistent, weapons are stupid, and not immersive, same for vehicles, like flying lock on bikes, missions are poorly designed and are repetitive, and grinding is petty, so that some can buy one useless car after 5 heists, also many money grabs made by the absolute scum that is rockstar games"

14054,got banned for lagging out lost all my shit dude. i had so much stuff and i had to do it again because i just got a pc so and i can not contact them because they wont look at why i got banned.dose not make good seance
14055,"Played for over 100 hours and pc now and was really enjoying it until i was banned for no reason, i grinded all my money legit and didnt use any exploits yet there are hackers in almost every lobby who never seem to get banned."
14056,"I really do not understand the hype for this game. I tried it out for a couple of weeks, and it is after all a Gta game. But there are some major issueswith it at this time.

First of all, the story mode is disappointing. I did it all and some things were fun, but overall, the feeling of rising in the ranks and building up businesses and making money in the underworld is totally secondary. 

This becomes the sole purpose of the online version of the game. Where everything missing from the story mode is there in terms of business building etc... But for some reason, those briliant developpers thought it would be a good idea to totally break the game with some OP vehicles that make no sense whatsoever and with a heist mission that makes all of the other activities and business building totally irrelevant. 

My main complaint, besides the fact that there are far too many military vehicles available to players to purchase, is the Oppressor. Which is an unrealistic game breaking vehicle. There is no way a new player can approach this game and try to grind its way in the business building without having to face some d*** h*** riding this flying missile shooting scooter while you basically have no defences. 

On the other hand, you have the Cayo Perico heist which is so lucrative and can be done solo, that buying businesses is useless for making money. Just grind your way up to little over 2 milion and there you go. You have your end game mission and from there you can buy anything with little to no effort rendering the rest of the content irrelevant. 

Besides these two main issues, I would have a lot to say about some of the mechanics which are totally incosistent. From one type of heist to another, rules of engagement, behavior of the npcs and objectives are so different in the way they function, there is no real ‚Äúcommon rule‚Äù in the mechanics of the game. Which makes no sense and makes it harder to immerse in this ‚Äúvirtual space‚Äù. 

I'll just add that, it is kind of ironic that the online version seems to force players to play together while making it hard to communicate, create team and send private messages in game. There are ways, but I guess that there could have been more consistant ways of achieving those goals. 

So, in my opinion there is NO REASON whatsoever new players should approach this game at this point. You might be interested in the story mode, which in itself is not bad despite my disappointment (San Andreas was much better in my opinion). But the online part of the game is badly designed, inconsistant, broken and the UI is terrible, hard to understand at first, with a lot of things you need to look online to understand how they work.

Edit: I kept playing as it seems that my concerns were in fact planned to be addressed with a new Dlc I wasn't aware of. Overall, these changes did pretty little. The game is per se broken. On top of that, I have come to understand that there is also a major cheaters issue. What I thought to be just an episodic problem is actually a persistent issue. And Rockstar seems to not care or address the issue. Please do bear in mind this is not a free to play game, you actually pay to purchase a product that is highly and inexcusably flawed. Cheating is so bad that in some sessions its impossible to play. And its a 9 year old game. Meaning, the developpers really do not care about honest paying players. Wonder how they plan to keep their customer base and keep selling their trash. I am a Gta fan since the start (yeah, that akward looking '90s game). I guess Rockstar is just another company, like many lately, only interested in getting your cash without delivering or caring for their players. 

Edit 2: By all means, you can avoid cheaters by playing in an invite only lobby without having the restrictions there were before. But to play alone, why play an ""Online"" game at all?"
14057,"ive been playing this game for years, and since i have finally gotten the pc version of it, it is not what i expected it to be at all, there arent sweats or too many hackers, and when there are they are generally nice and not hostile. that being said, there are a lot of trolls in public missions."

Bought it for the online only.

[list]
  [*] Online was good. Now looks like GTA San Andreas when you start using cheat codes. You can pay a lot of ingame money (that happens to be available as a micro-transaction) for a flying motorcycle that shoots homing missiles.
  [*] Good (offline) story
  [*] Interesting fact: graphics are better in single player mode. It requires more computing power though,
  [*] Online still has interesting modes
  [*] Even though it's almost a 10yo game, rockstar still adds content to it
  [*] Radios are one of the best things of GTA since San Andreas

14113,"I think I have spent probably 20 hours just in loading screens, another 10 hours in lobbies and their loading screens, another 20 hours just to drive to the damn mission after it starts, and another 10 hours stuck in soft lock loading screens. This whole game is a standing in line simulator just to play it, avoid the traffic just to get to the mission for 10 minutes for a mission that lasts 3 minutes.

I am reminded yet again why I have this game uninstalled. not to mention the constant money farm scams, the hackers, etc.

playing this game creates anger and frustration, and i'm baffled why these issues are still issues."

However, most people want to make money and get cool cars but the main point of the game is pvp so it can get annoying whe nyou try to make money and have fun because there are people having there own type of fun by kill you or modding so be aware. overall I enjoy playing this game and making new friends and getting cool cars. I suggest trying this game out."

14338,"Alright. Given that I have a hefty amount of hours in the big world of Grand Theft Auto 5, I am just about ready to write a review of what I think. First of all, I am more of an online player BUT I have played the story mode. So keep in mind that while reading. Lets begin.

This game was released nearly 10 years ago and somehow still manages to compete with every game out there right now, which in itself is very impressive. I have been a player since I would say 2015(Played on 360 and PS4). Since all that time, the game has never gone stale enough for me to quit it for good. I've taken large breaks from the game though. Yet, somehow you come back on to shoot some NPC's or just look at some of your property and than 'BAM!'. You are back in the cycle. Which(I'm assuming) is why the game has been staying alive for such a long time. That and... Content.

Storymode Content
The story for GTA 5 is quite interesting and will be able to keep you wanting more from the characters and their decisions. Franklin and Michael are great ways to start of the story and introduce the many sides of Los Santos, the poor dynamic of the ""hood"" and the rich miserable people of Vinewood. And if you manage to stick on storymode, it rewards you with everyone's favorite hellraiser. Trevor. Which adds a larger dynamic and gives you more of the map to explore. The story is rich and makes you feel like you really are progressing with different jobs and heists. Then getting the end. And once you completed storymode and feel you want more, look towards online.

Online Content
Online is a lot different then storymode. Firstly, I'd like to say that Online is 10x more fun if you have a few buds to do the Heists with or just mess around when you are done with grinding. It starts you off with a character creation then pushes you into the world of Los Santos. And what are you to do first? Well, make money. That is your only goal in Online. Make money so you can buy a tank or, god forbid, an oppressor mk 2. And you can do this a plethera of ways, you can open a illegal corporation that transports goods or you could buy a Clubhouse and produce some of the Devils Lettuce(amongst other things). OR take another route and do some Heists. These are all ways to make money. But starting off in the game is extremely difficult. All of the grandeur ways of making money require you to spend a pretty penny that you don't have. The usual cycle for starters is doing some VIP work until you can afford a office, then you have to get a warehouse. Then you grind for many hours to get enough money to afford the Kosatka so that you can do the Cayo Perico heist over and over and over and over again. And boom that is the story. The 2 major issues for GTA Online is
A. The Paywall 
B. The Grinding. 

Starting off in the game is extremely difficult(as mentioned) and after players get tired of grinding VIP work then eventually buy some ingame money with some of your real life money. And you might keep doing that and I get that a company needs to make its money but this game is one of the highest selling of all time, there is no need to bleed the player dry. So as a solution, GET THE CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE BUNDLE. This will give you a headstart into the world of GTA and could help you stick with the game longer without having to buy shark cards. And while, yes, some of it will still require you to grind a bit, it won't ever be as hard or annoying as it was in the beginning.

In Conclusion
This game isn't one of the highest selling of all time for no reason. It is a great game that has a few faults. I would recommend everyone to try it at least once. Both storymode and online. Hell, take a trip to the Vanilla Unicorn while you're at it."

14356,"After waiting three days for the starter pack to work. I found out that you can basically do nothing with your on-line character to make any money or use any of the so called free places and items that you get in the game by purchasing the criminal enterprise starter pack unless you play in a public lobby.

Public lobbies have people with infinite rocket launcher ammo shooting you everytime you respawn.
Public lobbies also have the fighter jets, yes fighter jets spinning rapidly in circles like a helicopter blade while flying through buildings and never missing you when firing.

The developers and alike are well aware of these people and still want you, no demand that you play with them. HA.

If these lobbies sound like fun to you, please throw your money into the $$$itter, after wiping your @## with it. Don't forget to wash your hands, you filthy animal."
14357,It's an amazing 3rd person and 1st person game. I love the graphics and the way you can do whatever you want without anyone messing you up. (EXCEPT FOR THE FRICKING COPS) I love online and the story mode. I would recommend to all gamer 13 and up.
14358,This game allows me to pursue my dream career of being citizen of Los Angeles.

14362,"It's really hard to have nothing to do. There's tons of mission, different collectibles, and stats that you can max. Even if you get bored of story mode there's way more in Online, and you can play with friends."
14363,Very amazing game and thank you mohammed for the rewards!

14370,yes yesz   yes
14371,"GTA Online sucks, so do this:
>Get a mod menu, if you'd like a free one, download Scripthook V and put it in your GTA directory.
>Load into story mode, (do not do online)  and get through the prologue. Once you are able to run freely as Franklin, press F5 to open up the mod menu.
>There a lot of options but I recommend getting a vehicle and just driving around to test it out.
> Once you are done with that, download openIV and reshade. You can look up a tutorial on the specifics on how to install them.
>Buy quantV or Natural vision evolved, both are great, and install with open IV, by dragging the file they come with into openIV and install it. Again you can look up specifics on how.
>install enb too, and find a good reshade/enb for the graphics mod you got.
>And boom, you just got yourself a Substitute for GTA 6/GTA Online
>Have fun :)"

14460,had a lot of fun with this game!! you can play it solo but playing with friends is more fun.
14461,its a game that will never make you fill bored
14462,"gta v is a masterpiece. everybody knows what the game is on the surface. some people will even straight out tell you it's a 'murder simulator'. while that description isn't wrong, what people like that, hell, most people infact, even those who consider themselves to be fans of the game don't even realize that there's a whole meta commentary on the stock market in the game and how by manipulating the stock market you can even make more money that the game's final heist is worth (200 million per character). there are people in the game that are giving you (the small time but up and coming criminal) mission that pay well but you don't really realize that the nature of the missions causes the stock market to go up and down which those people who gave you the missions invest/buy/sell based on the outcome of your mission and make million dollars and pay you a cool 40 thousand which you think is an awesome take. kinda makes you think about who the REAL criminals are huh?"

14469,"So yeah, half of my hours are made in the Loadingscreen simulator *caught* excuse me, chillin and wathin a blackscreen. After a mission is done it's not for sure that you are going to be in the same session as your friends, and did I mentioned? it takes 10 years to join a session too. Also every session is filled with modders they couldn't find a way to ban them in 9 years. Game is a grind, ppl can grief with annoin overpowered items that low level stand no chance against. They are ""nerfing"" one soon but we all know it's still going to be overpowered. New Updates once every 2 years, They haven't finished fixing this game and they started working on GTA 6 :facepalm: tones of bugs that slow ur progres. But the one nice thing is when you start and have good content after the 300 hr mark or so things start to slow down."

Chinese players should be separated from the community to their own servers, where they can play with other chinese players who also use cheats.

14546,"It was a fun game for a while. It is unfortunately unplayable. Cheaters are more common than regular players. You cannot avoid them if you want to do casino heists and other parts of the game as you can only do those in live public lobbies. If you like getting griefed and being blown up on spawn over and over and not being able to play the game at all, sure, buy this janky ass pos. Honestly I can't believe Cockstar is still selling this for actual currency let alone selling their in game cash cards. IMplement some god damn anti cheat please."

14581,The game is fun but Rockstar  is a money hungry company that doesnt care about its player base. All you do in Online now is just get servers full of hackers and reporting doesnt actually do anything and everybody knows it. this game is a joke at this point.
14582,"Too many hackers. They close your sessions, they screw up your missions, reporting does nothing. If you haven't yet gotten then just beware the hackers. They are super prevalent and can literally see if you report them and I've had my game crashed out by them and a friend screenshot that the hacker was bragging they did it."

14641,"gameplay is so fun but half of your game-time will be staring at a loading screen, trying to get out of glitches/bugs and questioning your life choices"
14642,best game ever
14643,"Getting ban with no clarification for what and can't even ask to be unban. The game is just garbage in my opinion, because if you play the legit way, you can purchase what you want after 11 heists. The developpers don't know how to calculate the price of a plane by the money you earn with heists. So if you don't do glitches, the game is not fun, but if you do some you're banned. Btw cheaters are everywhere, kill everyone and if they give you some money, you're getting banned too.(even if you didn't ask for it)"
14644,i'm putting a thumbs up but i wouldn't recommend this game. I'm just in a silly goofy mood!
14645,Pure fun.  I play a lot of other games and whenever I come back to GTA Online I'm immediately reminded of how straight-up FUN this game is.  Especially if you earn everything legit and don't cheat or mod like the douchebags you'll see everywhere.  Tip:  While playing you can yoink your internet cord count to 2 and plug it back in and it will put you on a server by yourself so your missions aren't constantly interrupted by a teleporting god mode dickhead with a murderboner.

14759,"n Congress, July 4, 1776

The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Dec"

14781,what the balls
14782,"very good 
"
14783,Meh. Worth giving a few hours.
14784,"Although it was initially released in 2013, this game has had numerous re-releases over the years. While the main single player story mode has remained mostly unchanged; the online version (which is available standalone as GTA online) has been the main source of the titles staying power over a multiple releases on a number of platforms. This does not take away from the value of the main single player story as it has aged remarkably well considering all things considered. If anything, this game can be purchased on the merits of the single player aspect alone. However, Rockstar seems to have made it a point to pump a great amount of time and effort into their multiplayer mode and has been a bit of a cash cow for them. As a result the game play in online sessions is a little stale, the game play loop is generally centered around making you drive (or fly) to an rural part of the map, killing a few NPC ad then returning with a pick up to the more activity populated city part of the map. 
I will say that even thought the game play is a little mundane, there is something about the growth that you feel as your online avatar is able to purchase a whole slew of things that can be used to directly or indirectly grow the amount of income you are capable of producing that has kept me coming back to the online mode for hours on end. 
Generally speaking, I do not enjoy games that make you grind, but this seems to have been an exception to that and is among the most casual games in my library. The biggest annoyance you will find are other players who seem to be bored with the grind and are primarily interested in growing their KD ratio in a game mostly focused on role playing as the head of a criminal enterprise; with that in mind my greatest advice to anyone just starting out is to try to find a community that fits how you want to play the game, be it with friends or in the many groups that are available and quite active all over the internet."

14814,shit game
14815,why cant i be in a lobby for 5 fucking seconds without getting explotions spawned on me out of nowhere or my game getting frozen by a modder? this is the worst online game i've ever played. are the makers of this game incapeble of using a good anticheat. like what is the point in reporting someone? they won't get banned.
14816,"Oh what Grand Theft Auto has become, if there's any reason why you're on the store page for GTA 5 in 2022, it's likely not for it's story mode, it's for the online component. And while I can't deny that the bulk of my hours in this game nowadays is spent in online and it is indeed fun with friends and when you experience those moments of dumb fun and joy, I cannot in good conscious recommend this game.

""Now, why is that? Mr. 578 Hours?"" I definitely hear you asking, well, aside from the fantastic story mode that the Grand Theft Auto series is well known for, the online component has shown Rockstar that they don't really need to try with making new or interesting singleplayer content - something that the GTA series was known for, and it's a shame that the closest we'll be getting to it is buggy missions added to Online, or yet another Online expansion that has recycled concepts from scrapped Story Mode DLC. Not to mention the massive money farm that Online has become, thanks to not just game sales but also Shark Cards, which allow people to buy money that can barely get them any of the more powerful vehicles. To get one of the most infamous vehicles in online, the Oppressor MK2, one requires purchasing the Oppressor, a Terrorbyte to store it in, and a Nightclub to store the Terrorbyte in, totaling out to about $5 Million in-game, and that isnt even getting into how hard that is to comprehend to new players, or how that costs over $50 in real world dollars, or how other routes for owning and upgrading vehicles are just as expensive and require extensive grinding to even reach (Hence my almost 600 hours, and more that I will rack up after this review).

And yet despite the fact that this game is so lucrative to Rockstar, it feels as if they don't care or are being told not to fix even the most basic of issues by their Publisher, Take-Two. GTA Online is filled with so many inconveniences, glitches, and modders that it can sometimes make the game a joyless slog to play. 

[b]In the case of inconveniences, you have:[/b]
The slow and clunky snack and body armor system, acting as one of the few ways of healing damage (Thankfully Rockstar is addressing this in an upcoming update, better late than never) 

Lack of fast travel even though you can use jobs as warp points, and joining a new lobby will warp you to your spawn

Custom loadout system that allows you to hide weapons you dont use, yet you need to buy a Gun Locker that costs roughly $300K PER PROPERTY

If you experience ""An Error"" in a GTA Online session, it will boot you back to story mode, and you'll be forced to reload back into online, which takes minutes

The knowledge that if it's a bug that makes the game much harder to play, but doesnt allow you to make money faster, Rockstar likely wont patch it.

[b]You also have lovely bugs that have existed for a shocking amount of time, such as the following:[/b]

Heist Finales not paying what they should (Crew Cuts seemingly reset)
Getting stuck on infinite loads
Being given weapons or equipment you shouldn't have and can't get rid of
Transaction Pending getting stuck for an eternity
Your personal vehicle winding up destroyed
Social Club refusing to launch GTA 5 because you have an incorrect setting in-game or something in your file structure

[b]Not to mention the abundance of hackers, and Rockstar's negligence of the game's security[/b]. There are so many hackers on this version of the game that it's honestly insane that they havent infested every corner of this game and ruined it for all involved. What's worse though is how Rockstar either can't or simply refuses to implement any form of anti-cheat or improve the security of their net code, all bans are manual which means that unless your account is really suspicious, you can get by scott-free, but also hackers have the ability to see the IP addresses of all players connected in a session, which is a huge security issue (and it doesnt help that Social Club is just as bad, your Rockstar ID literally being associated with your IP and not being an account #).

I hate GTA 5, I hate what it has taught Rockstar, and that Online has shown Rockstar that they don't need to try and make a new and original product. It's been almost a decade since the release of this game, and not much has changed with story mode, and online's missions mechanically have not evolved beyond, ""Go from point A to point B to collect C."" Online strains aging and dated mission design and art in a game world that could have used an expansion at least a couple years ago. With focus on GTA 5 being primarily on Online, so many new updates have caused a whole array of bugs in Story Mode, breaking the way cutscenes work and causing game-breaking bugs that ruin the airtight polish of Story Mode at release. This is a game that has been ruined over time thanks to corporate greed and a lack of interest in Singleplayer content, which is disappointing in a series about singleplayer experiences. I've been playing this game since launch, I've been around since Xbox 360 and I've seen this game change over the last 9 years, not in terms of mechanics or new and meaningful editions, but watching as yet another great installment in a franchise known for its well-written stories and third-person action mutated into a product of corporate greed and derelict ideas being wasted, and Rockstar - or more accurately at this point, Take-Two - has shown no signs of changing this formula.

Would I recommend this game to someone else? If you're in it for Story Mode, then absolutely, but the Online component I would only recommend if you have other friends willing to play it with you, otherwise, stay away, and don't give Rockstar/Take-Two your money until they prove that they can make something worth your time."

14830,"I played GTA V for a long time just doing online with my friends, which was fun but eventually we found that it was only good once in a while since getting a ton of money can be very grindy and there isn't always something amazing to buy.

Way later on I played the story mode and was pretty impressed. It wasn't an insanely well written masterpiece or anything but it works well enough for a first playthrough and despite all the time wasters like having to spend way too much time driving places and all the boring missions, I overall think it's worth it. Please though, if you are going to buy this game, wait for a sale. It isn't going anywhere I promise."

14835,"The begin with, the game is buggy as is. You'll run into plenty of modders and griefers that'll ruin your entire day. But if you just move past it and try to actually enjoy the game for what it really is, you'll realize that it's relatively grind heavy. You'll spend at least 20hrs getting a few million dollars to put towards one thing. Rinse and repeat. That's how this game works, unless you buy into rockstars plan and purchase shark cards like I did, then you'll be fine. Overall, I'd give this game a 6/10, despite it's bugs and P2W game structure."

14875,"I've gone into rage mode more 30 times because of unfair game glitchs and players with less IQ then a mozzarella stick, but besides that Grand Theft Auto Online is a magnificent idea that can and should've been great if Rockstar Games didn't make so many mistakes that the game has become so bad that it's basically only people who pay for in game currency and the other player who just mods and creates kaos that makes hell look like a goddamn daycare for dads.

Grand Theft Auto's Single Player experience is fonominol with out any doubt and thats probably because of it being a single player experience that tends to stay the same from it's release and that is a goddamn good thing because it's the only thing Rockstar hasn't complete and utterly F***ed.

But if your into kaos fine play GTA Online, but if your into structure and story and much more fairness when it comes to making money atleast compared to the online version then single player is the thing you keep playing, and god help us all if Rockstar decides to create a newer version of this game it's eather gonna be a cluster f**k or something close enough to simply work."

14888,I wasn't able to get this computer to run on my computer sadly which was why I refunded it but I played this on my xbox besides the online being a big mistake the singleplayer is still very fun to the point where i wanna play this in real life now *later in court* You're honor I think I was possessed or something cause I don't remember hijacking a tank and shooting random cars for no reason and then the tank blowing up and I somehow survived

14909,I've lost many brain cells while playing online.
14910,Becomes very tedious after some hours of multiplayer i don't see the point of grinding when all these hackers ruin the experience. It's fun for free roaming because missions tend to get stuck most of the time and alot of players are deliberatly trolling and waste time. Good luck trying to invite players you will need to be patient like really patient :')
14911,pretty fun
14912,"Dragging this game from eternity .. let it RIP

14933,Very Nice Game.....
14934,"Its pretty good
But the online is full of hackers and it can quickly take all the fun out"
14935,"The game has its moments and in no way do i hate the game itself, however, the amount of hackers especially recently is just staggering. It seems to have escalated to such a high point that I've now had ""modders"" follow me into every lobby I go into, (nothing new for modders), and grief me until I get off, only to do it the moment i get back on, whether is be a few hours later or even days. Honestly don't pick up the game as you will encounter these people who will ruin your fun and rockstar doesn't seem to do anything about it (unless of course it's a modder which gives you money then you'll see action within the day). So for your sanity and time, find a different game to play."

14989,good
14990,"Hey Rockstar,

Would be nice if you stopped focusing on profits and updates and started working on the modder issue. All we seem to get are updates, new features etc. That's nice. But there isn't a single lobby where there isn't someone modding. At worst the game is unplayable. If you can't be bothered fixing the issue, fair enough. But the way I see it, you're beating a dead horse without rooting out problems and developers that address these issues usually stand out from the crowd, not that you care because you've already made your millions and probably will continue to, right? At the very least use a fraction of that and outsource it. Cmon Rockstar, you used to be cool."
14991,fire
14992,very good
14993,"I would recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a real life shooter game.
Awesome graphics, features and new updates.

14996,I just bought GTA and bought a new PC and for some reason it won't launch Rockstar Launcher because it's 'Not responding'

Don't play if you dont want to die to random people or just dont want to get exploded by someone hacking in godmode with explosive ammo.

15192,"At the time of writing this, GTA V is 7'ish years old so introductions seems redundant, instead I'll explain how I play GTA V (and RDR2) and why.
I put too much value on my gaming time, to have other players mess it up for what 99% of the time is just spite and a desire to see the world burn. I don't hate playing with other people (I've played MMO's for 20 years) but some games, especially console focused online games, have a toxicity about them that I try to stay away from.
I still like the feeling and the vibe and i love the sandbox play style, so i always play GTA V in a solo lobby. It makes some parts of the game more or less unplayable. Some encounters simply require a group to get through, but 90% of the game can be played solo. There are a few sell missions, that was obviously designed for 2-3 people but the time limit still makes some of them possible to do solo.
GTA V is one of the very few games, where driving fast using a keyboard is not only possible but actually fun. I guess the police could be less ""aggressive"" but getting away from a wanted level is easy enough ... mowing down police with a machine gun not only gets old really fast, but always have the opposite effect. It would be nice with a ""in between"" reaction by the police where they don't open fire straight away ...
I conclusion; GTA V _can_ be played solo but it's obviously not the intended way to play it and unless you're comfortable working around group content it probably won't be enjoyable."
15193,nice
15194,SO FUN

15204,"Nice game, and very fun to play with friends."
15205,"Another Masterpiece from Rockstar <3   
#Best_Game :)"
15206,"The story mode is great, I love the characters and the story is quite interesting (I'll admit I haven't finished it but I am enjoying it thus far). The game is successful in making the player feel like a true criminal through various illegal acts (speeding, stealing, heists, the list goes on).

However, I have to heavily criticize the online mode. The idea is great, a world full of criminals committing citywide crime against NPCs and each other. But this is ruined by the fact that it takes so long to get money and be able to buy stuff (stuff that is required to partake in the citywide crime party).  There are also a slew of hackers that tend to seriously sour the mood.

In short, stick to Story Mode if you want to have a good time."

15239,Very bad tutorial mission that just had you got shot over and over again while you waiting and reading the tutorial message. Ended up needing friends helped to get pass tutorial which fail to teach me how to play. Then suddenly I somehow got into some kind of vs game mode that I did not get prompted to join but the game put me there anyway. Still don't know why some game mode need players to host a job but some other time you just got put in it without consent. Not a fun experience so far and I still don't understand what to do even after completing the tutorial.

It must really be an exceptional game because I usually spend around 30 hours with a good game before I need to switch to another title. But here I played 100 hours straight... something that happened to me only with few other super titles."

15279,"I am a 47 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is 12 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

You can play as Big Mike, professional sad man and surprisingly non-cheater despite having such a terrible family, it's probably better to be a castrated monk to be quite honest. Then there's Franklin (same name as the cartoon turtle), professional street n*gga who prolly has a BBC but you'll never know because the game isn't as cool as cyberspunk 2k77. Last of all, there is Treble who actually sucks f*ck him. Everytime you're forced to play as him, I can't help but imagine the smell. And the smell is: un-washed clothes + dried urine."

15337,"GTA V has an abundance of such moments, big and small, that make San Andreas the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas feel like a living world where anything can happen. It is a leap forward in narrative sophistication for the series, and there‚Äôs no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasn‚Äôt been improved over Grand Theft Auto IV. This is the most beautiful and generous GTA game. To Many Cheaters on computer though. I was a console player switching to computer and bought it on steam. I loaded up a lobby and instantly found cheaters playing. They were grief killing and spamming in chat so I just left the lobby. Nothing is wrong with this game even though there is many cheaters because you can always join a new online session. I would still recommend you to play on computer but just wanted to give a warning to people buying this game so they are aware."

15407,"Red sun
Red sun over paradise
Red sun
Red sun over paradise


Golden rays of the glorious sunshine
Setting down, such a blood-red light
Now the animals slowly retreat
To the shadows ‚Äì out of sight


Arid breeze blows across the mountains
Giving flight to the birds of prey
In the distance machines come
To transform Eden ‚Äì day by day


Only love is with us now
Something warm and pure
Find a peace within ourselves
No need for a cure


When the wind is slow
And the fire‚Äôs hot
The vulture waits to see what rots
Oh how pretty
All the scenery
This is nature‚Äôs sacrifice

When the air blows through
With a brisk attack
The reptile tail ripped from its back
When the sun sets
We will not forget the
Red sun over paradise

Well, everyone knows the Grand Theft Auto series by now, heck, many of us grew up with them, If you want to play online, make sure to bring a few friends with you for the best experience, and if you want to get the single-player stories done and over with, you will enjoy the game all alone since the story is fun, so just like other GTA's, try GTA-V if you haven't already!

I want to play by myself, not with a pack of retards that are cheating, don't even care about the story line, just want to play the game in sandbox mode. Since its unplayable now I have decided to delete it from my inventory. I possibly can't recommend this junk as it is now."
15591,By far one of my favorite games to play especially with friends. The amazing story line combined with a multiplayer full of content really made me enjoy this game. Sure there's a few bugs still in the game here and there but I don't think it ruined my experience too much. Hopefully rockstar will release GTA6 soon.

"
15620,"Let me keep it 1000% with you.  When the game works it's one of the best games I've ever played.  However.. in less than 40 hours of total playtime I've had thousands of different errors that prevent me from getting into servers online, hundreds of glitches that cause me to waste time in game and some that I'm unable to fix without restarting the entire game.  Even had the game completely crash a half dozen times.  So when it's working it's incredibly fun.  But when it's making me try to reconnect online 5+ times in a row giving me an error over and over and over, or when people in my lobby get stuck in the Heist menu screen and it forces us all to quit the Heist.. it's easily one of the most frustratingly annoying games you'll ever play.  

With that said.. how much patience do you have?  If you don't have alot, STAY AWAY!  Otherwise proceed with caution and understand this game is going to make you RAGE from all the bugs/glitches etc. that have been in this game for YEARS!  I know because despite only 38 hours played on this account, I used to have an account on PS4 years ago that had more than 1000 hours played.  Now I'm on PC though."

15634,"Ah where do i start.
GTA 5 is a game i have been playing for quite awhile (quite common amongst Gamers)
And i always played story mode with no goal in mind expect well robbing banks the same goes for Goldies like GTA San Andreas (except robbing cars).
I actually Genuinely Enjoy the Main Story line and there is actually nothing wrong with it.

But that is not what i am here to talk about, that being obviously the big mistake GTA online partially is.
The fact that story mode is not allowed new Weapons and Vehicles unless using mods but still feel like a cheat and is not available amongst fellow console players.
It would be nice if there were new weapons and updates for main story mode so we would not get bored after Several Years of playing it.

This is where i mention how completely screwed the global community is atop the fact that Everyones Goal is to kill new players that start out in the games for no reason other than a random bounty placement or just because they feel like it, the game just gives players to much of a goal to kill other players making GTA online a PVP game which i actually did not start the franchise intending it to be.
I dont know about all of you but i did not want GTA online to get thrown down a Ditch and given a bad name to GTA 5 as it actually is a goldie but minus GTA online.

The truth is the starting out part of this game is literally very hard if you keep getting blown up by Flying Bikes every 2 New Sessions. then getting blown up by jets when i take one step out my house after i literally just logged in, also me just trying to do a VIP Mission then getting killed at the very end Losing more cash than i Spent.
That is also Minding the CHEATERS in this game and also Modders.
Everytime i try fighting back it is then just a cheater using godmode soaking my bullets up and Flexes on it like he is way Better than me... Like wtf..?
Then if a server is actually having fun eventually some modder joins and starts editing traffic and starts switching off peoples vehicles mid drive, and then sends a small little love letter coated in explosives.

Things i am told are to just play a Solo Server if its that bad.
Im not really playing GTA online to play alone, thats why im playing GTA online.
im playing to make money and see what is up with the community most of the time. (which is mistakenly how i started the game off) i guess being friends with the community is not a good idea with GTA 5 since:
You will get killed within atleast a minute or two near another player
You also fail alot of missions due to everyone not being able to Cooperate or they leave midway which Kicks everyone which is another 20 minutes of Loading screen Time.
Also The Loading Screen Times are an Awful Curse that is Born in Hell put in this Video Game. Why should a loading screen be this long. GOD KNOWS.
But i also wanna mention how badly this game punishes you without other players and also how little Cash it gives you on heists compared to what you need to buy for you to continue the story line in gta online.
This is a really long Review but it mainly is my Pain in a nutshell
and also my partial goodbye to GTA Online since it is unplayabe and NGL solo GTA online boring as hell bruh.
I would come back if it had a better anti cheat aswell as better PVP Intentions and alot of love and care, this is a god damn video gaming company with alot of money, how is it not possible.
this game took my money, time and effort. Let it atleast be worth it

The story mode is intriguing and fun.
BUT the online mode is toxic, and boring. It is only entertaining and fun with friends, the missions are also boring, everything is expensive (it's literally impossible to gain money without cheating) and speaking about cheating there are many people with hacks that can blow up the whole server. I will give this game a negative review only for my bad experience with the online mode."

15783,"Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game developed by Rockstar north and published by Rockstar Games in 2013. It is the 7th main entrance in the Grand Theft Auto series set in ‚ÄòLos Santos‚Äô, a fictional city based on southern California. 
The main story follows 3 main protagonists, Michael De Santa, Franklin Clinton, and Trevor Phillips. The player plays each of them throughout the story and they each have their own specific main and side missions. 

Players can experience the GTA V story through a first or third person perspective as they complete the linear storyline. Outside of the main story however, the player can freely roam ‚ÄòBlaine country‚Äô, the area outside the main city, Los Santos. There is no restriction and can be fully explored from the beginning of the game, however, many gameplay features do not become accessible until certain parts of the story have been completed.

New gameplay features absent in the previous GTA Games were a fine addition, notably the flying mechanics with Trevor, the pilot of the group. The player can at any point switch to another of the main protagonists, each with their own set of skills that the player can level up through playing that specific character, (i.e Franklin is very good at driving and the skill is almost maxed out at the beginning of the game). Additionally, each character has their own ability depending on their skill. (Franklin has driving skill, Michael and Trevor both have combat/shooting related skills).

During heists, especially larger ones the player must select certain people to participate in the heist (i.e a gunman, hacker etc), all depending on the requirements of the heist. These members have their own skills, the more skilled the higher cut they receive from the heist. 

GTA V features both an online, and singleplayer campaign featuring a large amount of entertainment for the player with hundreds of hours of content even after the main story. However, the online aspect of the game is best experienced with friends as alone there are little heists and many hackers ready to ruin the experience. This is the main complaint and controversy with Grand Theft Auto Online as Rockstar seems reluctant to add any ‚Äòcompetent‚Äô or ‚Äòeffective‚Äô anti-cheat software. 

Due to GTA V‚Äôs innovative gameplay, it was easily able to become one of the most popular games of its time and to this day largely due to the constant updates for GTA online which is now the main appeal. Despite this the story is still very well made with little bugs (at least in my experience). Considering this GTA V is a solid 8.5/10 as a solo RPG and 7/10 as an online."

But r star really üêÇ, he doesn't care whether you violate the rules of the game in the end, as long as r star thinks it is, then you are, there is no chance of appeal, direct ban, account clearance, nothing after a few months. I don't care about the scum of the server, I don't care about the game environment that hangs b flying around, but this irresponsible and imperious attitude is really, really üêÇ ‚Ñ¢ disgusting"

15812,"My favorite part was when Michael said ""It's over Devin. We are Grant Theft Auto V"""
15813,"Multiplayer is absolutely filled with hackers. Every single lobby. I was just playing the game normally and a hacker began a mod where I suddenly began claiming bounties set on him according to the screen even though I was not even on the map with him. I left the lobby just to find out the next day my account was suspended and my character was reset. Not only did I have to spend all my time harassed by hackers slowing my progress and destroying my supplies and killing me unprovoked in every lobby, one finally got my entire account reset and suspended when I did absolutely no hacking or cheating of my own. What in the world is even the point of playing something like that?  They have no way to appeal your ban . No way to explain to them or prove your innocence. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this game just to have all your hard grinding taken from you for nothing. Meanwhile the actual hackers are running rampant all over the lobbies unbanned while innocent players can apparently get removed in under 48 hours."

15832,"This game has worked wonders for a while now, I could find this to be one of my favorite games. The open world aesthetic makes the game feel more real then ever, especially the graphics too. This takes the fact of being able to do whatever you want in a criminal mastermind world of a game to a whole other level with the open world game and campaign mode to make the experience a whole lot better. Anyways, I highly recommend this game because it uses IRL game capacity and high definition graphics to make the game worth the money you put into it. The game also goes on sale pretty frequent, I bought the game and the criminal enterprise pack for like fifteen bucks. Also worth it for that."

15839,"This game is one of the greatest game of all time. There are just so many things to do, it's insane. You can fly in a helicopter, dive in a submarine, own businesses, rob banks. The world is so, so expansive and the detail of the world looks so realistic, from the desert, to the ocean, to blood on your car. The characters of Franklin, Trevor, and Michael are extremely memorable and have stellar voice acting. The story of the game is good, not great, because the narrative is not focused enough on the main betrayal and instead devolves into ""do this mission for this undeveloped character; now do this mission for this character"". The gameplay and driving is much better than in GTA IV (where driving felt like wobbling on ice) because it balances fun and proper physics. Overall, an excellent and most importantly fun, experience."

I would recommend that anyone who hasn't played this game yet (it's been out for almost 10 years) that you should give it a try. However ignore online I have about 9 hours on Online as of writing and it has been hell the support tickets to rockstar for the numero uno achievement have been awful. Other than that story mode is a beautiful game that has sadly over stayed it's welcome and has some dumb achievements like A new perspective, but I sadly my impression of story mode is not enough to mask the stench that is online. Online has so many issues rockstar haven't fixed since 2014! rockstar ruined their legacy with the Definitive Edition but they ruined their future with online. I am split down the middle for reccomendation but will give a thumbs up for story mode the ONLY saving grace for this game unfortunate."

R* has it's flaws, the public lobbies are a pain in the butt with hackers and Mk II Opressor's can suck but at the end of the day this game is more fun with 1-2 friends at the minimum. I recommend the Criminal Enterprise version of the game because at least you'll get a gun, house, business and car at the minimum, maybe add a shark card too just to get the business going, which is stupid to be honest, a good example is that I have the Import/Export business but I only get the building for free, I have to buy the warehouse for the supplies which is a few million dollars for a good one. It's a good game, a lot of customization and when you get your foot in the door (i.e. getting started on a heist or your business/gang going) the game is more enjoyable."

15922,"For the singeplayer part of the game: Absolutely L E G E N D A R Y. The story mode is one of the most fun experiences to play through of any game. There are so many things to do throughout the map like the strangers and freaks missions, just the normal missions, random events etc. Also alot of many fun achievements to collect.

For the online part of the game: I generally really like the gameplay, many new vehicles and many different things to do throughout the entire map. Tons of different missions like agency missions with franklin, missions with lamar and more heists with lester. Also a fun thing about online is being able to customize your vehicles without almost any limits and just have fun and drive/fly around.

What I don't like about online is the amount of modders and them being able to boot you offline, crash your game, put you in a cage or shoot 1000 rockets per second at you and constantly spawn killing you.
I think its shameful that a multi-billion dollar company can't even bother to get a reasonable anti cheat, or hide people's IP adress so they cannot be booted offline etc. Even games like MUCK that were kind of made as a joke by a youtuber, have way better security then a game like GTA-V made by a multi-billion dollar company.
But without modders the online experience is very good in my opinion.
From 10 points i would overall (considering the modders in online and some of the bugs you may encounter throughout playing the game) give a 7.5/10."

15925,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

15957,"If you enjoy shooter games ( Any perspective ) you'll enjoy this game. It's all about battling in high stake shoot-outs, robbing banks, and completing missions. You can live your life as a civilian, become a master criminal, or help hunt down crooks and criminals. If none of that appeals, maybe breaking into a military base will. As long as you have enough fire power, anything is possible in this game."

15967,"Spent money on a game that isn't monitored by its developer leading to insufficient security. Can't even run the game without it crashing or freezing due the complete intolerance towards cheaters and modders. Do not buy this game on PC until this problem is fixed, which it never will be because it's Rockstar Games.

As you can see, I have only played for a total of 4 hours when I'm writing this review. The fact that I have already run into this many problems is absurd. This game is not worth the money, at all. Play on a different platform



So 38 hours later, going thru the story, and revisiting online after the most recent update. This game is bearable now. Finally, Rockstar listened to us and now we can focus on our businesses instead of self preservation."

15981,"Grand Theft Auto V for PC offers players the option to explore the award-winning world of Los Santos and Blaine County in resolutions of up to 4k and beyond, as well as the chance to experience the game running at 60 frames per second.

I've played GTA 5 before on PS4. Now I decided to move on to PC version of it and if we're talking about GTA Online, I've played only 1.6 hours of this game and I already ran into modders who gave me action figurines for no reason at all. The game itself is fun of course but I have my fingers crossed that modders won't give me all the money they possibly can without me actually earning it. Amen to that. Recommend."

16181,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

16187,"Would like to start off by saying this review is for GTA:O specifically. GTA V is a decent game, with a great story.

However, that's where the good stuff stops. If you want this game, only get it for the story mode and do NOT touch GTA:O. It is cancer. Between the toxic player base and the absolute unchecked menace that is modders/hackers that Crapstar completely refuses to do anything about, its a literal piece of poop.

You'll spend thousands of hours legitimately grinding for millions to get your businesses up and going, all the while getting griefed by 12 year olds on a power trip, and hacked and kicked back to your desktop by modders that are bored but still playing the game for some reason. But you'll stick through it cause you have some fun sometimes when it isn't a total crap show. Eventually you'll have all the businesses going and earning a million dollars in a couple hours isn't a big deal for you. So you finally start buying yourself cool cars and filling out your garages and getting all the things. Only for Crapstar to suspend you and reset you for ""accepting"" some crappy modders money drops. It's in quotations cause you didn't have a say in the matter. The crapstain teleported the whole lobby to his apartment, then kicked you out, then started dropping. You run away and immediately switch lobbies, but the damage is done. Literal thousands of hours down the drain. Everything gone.

So if you want the story mode, I'd say only if you get it dirt cheap but its good for a couple playthroughs (100 hours at most). But stay away from online like its the freaking plague. It's such a crappy made game mode, I can't believe they made so much money off of it. This was my recent experience with it, and I'm happier now that I don't have to spend countless more hours on it trying to get 100% achievements and stuff. Cause it's getting hidden to be ignored for the rest of time. Save yourself the headache."

16209,"Love the game, always have. The only problem I have with it is they patched this glitch that would leave you falling under the map when you stepped on this one rock. I found this glitch in my first play-through of GTAV. The rock was near the river where you kill the leader of the Aztecas. Anyways, real bummer, no nostalgia."
16210,"id recommend it but only offline with mods or with fivem, not gta online tho ... too many cheaters and rockstar doesnt care about it"
16211,Everyone know this game. I don't have to say anything. It's good game (sometimes it's not). :D
16212,great game
16213,"its good but the anoying little kids ruin online
"
16214,"Admittedly, GTA V is a great game. I used to fiend almost everyday back in the PS3/360 era.
It aged pretty alright, as GTA in general is ""one of those"" games where there's honestly nothing much else like it, and anything else like it is probably x10 worse in quality.
I'd recommend the game as a time killer at most nowadays however. Truthfully tho, if you literally haven't played a GTA at all, just wait until the next installment. 
I mostly/always only ever really played GTA V for the Online aspect. And in this current age, Online is cool and all, but you're gonna encounter a ton of cheaters tbh. The game is flooded with them. Literally every game you join is bound to have atleast 1 guy in there who can cheat/hack their ass off, whether they're griefing or not. 

I copped this game on the recent Summer Sale that passed only because I was pretty much peer pressured too. Don't cop it unless on sell otherwise.
The games online is definitely outdated and they're milking it until no tomorrow. There was a time where you couldn't buy GTA $ with real money, and now, guess what, you can. That should tell you something."
16215,"the best game,"
16216,it is a very best game.....
16217,"Good game, I would rate it 10 out of 10 or something."
16218,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

16353,"Requires the R* launcher. So every time you want to play from steam, you have to launch the game, which launches the launcher, which logs into R*, which takes way too long, & then the launcher finally launches the game, & then the game has to load, which takes way too long, & then you can finally play, if you still feel like it.
Unless the R* social club is down or malfunctioning, which happens a lot, then you can't play the game you payed for & own at all. & R* doesn't care about any of this at all, because they're too busy making bank on mindless barrages of microtransactions for the online mode, which is completely unplayable due to the pervasive insufferable dbags.
All this for an ultimately mediocre game with a mindless story, It's an open world violence-simulator, that's it, but they always have to pretend they're making these deep dramas with mature themes, gtfo.
Avoid R* in general, if you can."

I don't remember having installed a Randomizer mod but the game opens with random settings every time. 
Requires Rockstar launcher. 
No DS4 controller support. 
Game lets you choose between directx 10, 10.1 and 11 which is very very useful (it is not), except it reverts to 10 every time. 
You need to quit the game to exit the benchmark.
If you open the pause menu, the game keeps insisting that you changed some setting and then you press ok only to be greeted by the same message repeatedly.

Thank god they kept re-releasing this over the past 10 years, just so we could experience the best version of this impeccable game."

16398,"I first bought this game @ a midnight launch on Xbox 360, then switched to PS4 when the game was re-released on ""next gen"", then switched again to PC when I built my computer, so I've been using the same character since the beginning.  The game was beautiful, even on 360, so the first thing I did was drive to a mountain overlooking the city to get a view of this beautiful game, and I was quickly stalked and killed by a mountain lion. 10/10 Highly recommend! 

Pros:
As I said, this game is beautiful. The graphics are on a completely different level than most games, and very rarely have I had any issues with glitches or lagging. They clearly put a lot of time and effor into the game! The map is HUGE but each section is memorable so you can easily get around once you know the terrain. 
In this game you play as 3 characters,  which you can switch between during gameplay. I like the characters and was invested in each of their storylines. And the replay value is certainly there, as I find myself returning every once in a while.
There is plenty of story mode content and lots to do so you should never be bored. 
Online has even more when it comes to content. I highly enjoy collecting fancy cars, doing missions with random people online and doing typical GTA shenanigans.  

Cons:
Other than fixing bugs and such, there really hasn't been any new content added to the game's story. Rockstar has focused so much time into GTA online that they've seemed to have left story mode in the dust. Hoping they continue to update the story in GTA 6 after it's released. 
Online can be hit or miss when it comes to the experience. Hackers seek to run rampant (typical for GTA), and they can ruin the game instantly.  They've also added way too much content, and things have gone over the top. Flying cars and aliens and hovercraft is just a bit too far for my liking. Oh! OH! And things you purchase online (mainly houses and cars) are WAYYYYY to expensive for what the mission payouts are. Before Heists were active, you had to either spend hours grinding the same mission over and over again, or buy Shark cards, and I'm not paying extra for fake cars online‚Ä¶.though my Zentorno is petting fucking nice! Haha.
My biggest complaint is the load times in the game. Like holy shit, the load times in this game are atrocious!!! It takes 5 minutes to load into the base game and another 5-10 to load into Online, IF it will let you online. I've spent 10 minutes in load screens online to be kicked back into story mode for network problems. I understand that the game is hugh and load times are inevitable, but these times are insane.
I also found that some of the physics / mechanics were better in GTA 4. Explosions, physical vehicle damage, AI, etc. were better in 4. After I play seriously for a while, I like to drive around the city and do stupid shit, but GTA 5 is almost too realistic to make it worthwhile. And cheats, for the love of God, bring back cheats!!!
Also, no glitched swingset - 0/10 :( haha

It's GTA, you need to play it at least once. I'd buy it again (for the 4th time?!?!) HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
"
16399,nice game
16400,"Bought this game 4 years ago, and it's been one of the most fun games I've played. Since then, I've logged over 1,000 hours of playtime (99% of it online), and have bought all the properties, businesses, cars, aircraft, guns, and other miscellaneous things I could possibly want. After doing all the heists, side missions, and other activities the community has to offer with other players, I feel like I've peaked in terms of getting what you want out of the game, and the only incentive left to play is to make more money. It is, however, more fun if you have friends who are consistently playing and have things to do in helping with each other's businesses and needs. The recent addition of the auto shop keeps things interesting, since I'm a car guy in real life. I'm thankful for the years of enjoyment and satisfaction I got out of this game, and wouldn't trade it for the world. 10/10"

i dislike online but ofc some people like it 
story mode is great and after you 100% the game if you don't care about your stuff then try speedrunning bc it'll keep you playing for much longer than normal story mode and you will only have multiple broken keyboards/smashed monitors/dead mice/snapped headphones/destroyed controllers/annihilated computers/holes in walls/exploded desks/maybe in top 10,000/if not then top 1,000,000 :) glhf"

16616,"Its an old game, fine, but for christ's sake have some level of anticheat detection or in this case anti mod. You charge people stupid prices for in game currency that by no means is equally fair. $90 real money for 8 mil fake money that barely gets you the things to setup for particular missions and heists (submarine, aracde, casino, etc.) Its basically 2 mil for the sub. 

Since modders screw up damn near every lobby I get into and have the ability to force crash whomever they feel like, that by definition is game breaking bull. Change the prices on the money at least R*. Or maybe if you gave a mil per dollar spent it'd make sense. $20 = 20 mil...but no...3 console gens later and who knows how many PC graphics card iterations later and still do things that inhibit playing the game that already cost $60 not on sale. Its like Skyrim but not fun. 

Other people determine your experience in the lobby. Makes League of Legends community look tame."

"
16674,"Started playing this game in 2013 on PS3, and it has been a downhill slide ever since. Griefers and Modders continuely ruin the game, and R* sucks as a company between this dumbster fire and abandoning RDR 2. Sadly there is no shortage of people buying Shark Cards so nothing will change."

- no safty features: this game is full of hackers and modders that abuse you or your child ,crashing,harssing and abusing you no matter where you are. YES EVEN IN SOLO LOBBYS

- pay to win : you earn less money by playing,cars are hilarious expansive, the money you pay for ingame $ is like the biggest joke. but now comes GTA+ yeah you heard right, you can abo gta and get rewards ingame like money better cars guns and so on.

UNLESS THEY PUT IN ANTI CHEATING & HACKING SERVICE AND SOFTWARE LIKE EAC OR SO THIS GAME IS NOTHING BUT WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY"

16891,"Fun game, but Rockstar couldn't give a crap about the insane modding and griefing that takes place in almost every single lobby."
16892,good game
16893,"EDIT: Thanks for finally updating the game Rockstar! Below is the negative review i gave not too long ago, but since then, the game has changed for the good. :)
--
The game is good, but the community can be toxic. I hate going into public lobbies without my friend cause of all the players that will insta kill you the second you start a mission for your CEO, MC, Nightclub, etc. I realize that's part of the game, but when a lvl +100 repeatedly spawn kills a lvl 30 player... it's not right.

I want to give this game a positive review, as the game it self is fun and there's a lot to do in GTA online and in the story, but I also want to warn new players of the online experience. Not everyone in the game is a greifer/modder, but they're very common to come across. Sometime things can be pretty peaceful in smaller sessions, and everyone will just leave each other alone. Rockstar seems to encourage this by having session challenges, instead of just creating a way for players to toggle PVP on/off."

This is only for anyone who didn't mark the checkbox for ""The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs"". Your doctor is going to help you!

Even with bugs its still a timeless game, there are workarounds to make the experience enjoyable and I'm definitely going to play this game on my Steam Deck(when I get it!)"

Instead buy the game on console so you at least don't have sweaty 500Kg men installing mod menus so they can prove there dominance by killing you with god mode.

Also the theme of a crime game set in the ,modern day really goes out the window when you walk outside to a man dressed in a gimp-suit on a flying motorbike with heat seeking missiles sits there waiting to blow up your faggio you picked up off of the side of the road.

GTA is a great series and i have really enjoyed it but if you are going to buy it in 2022 just wait until gta 6 comes out in 2050."

Online there are some megasigmadouches that will do whatever it is in their power to make your life a living hell.

I would recommend anyone who is weary early game, to simply start off in invite only sessions or friend only sessions, I don't know why but a lot of things aren't available to you if you go solo.

Been playing since it released on Xbox 360, it is way better now content wise, however the players are more frequently cynical in nature nowadays.

Still its a fun memory with friends. Mistakes are bound to happen on missions, and its better to be able to talk to a person about mishaps, instead of a mission failing and having no insight on the matter."

17020,"Overall I don‚Äôt have a review for this game; however, the specific review at this time is mostly related to in-game modders 
(code hackers / cheaters). As many of the players that do this, enjoy it. Yet, it deflates the quality of the game overall for other players.
Enjoying the game on a different level through accessing these code hacks is an enjoyable experience, but it drastically lowers the experience for players who choose not to cheat and / or hack.

There is no quality of game when one user can access a server and wipe the whole server user count in mere minutes. 

Perhaps there should be a specific server specifically for those who ‚Äúmodify‚Äù their angle of game play."

17046,"It was 6 p.m., I could hear the wind howling outside from the comfort of my gaming chair. I decided to fire up Grand Theft Auto 5 for yet another time. I joined a race. Not just any race, a wacky stunt race. Blazing fast turns in a track floating in the air above the city of Los Santos. I was facing insurmountable odds: a level 1500 player had just joined the server. All the other players were frozen in fear and were taken aback at the sight of his flamboyant pink car, which would lead us to otherworldly pain, plunging us into his reign of despair. The race started: cars were jolting everywhere at the speed of light and I miraculously managed to avoid thrashing my car. I somehow slogged behind him until the last ramp. Our cars were flitting in the tense air, when a third player melt our hopes and dreams away by teleporting himself to the finish."

I just recently have been playing it on steam over console and even with a high end rig it runs slightly worse as for some reason less things are patched on steam over xbox servers and you will find people who can magically teleport. other than that you can still grief people easy as ever and easily gain a mass fortune in game in under 20 hours from level 1 so, its only limited by rockstar themselves and steams lack of mod protection"

17083,DONT GO TO THE HIGH HEEL! BIG MISTAKE I WANTED SHOES
17084,good
17085,"Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate,
And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate,
Expell'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore.
Long labours, both by sea and land, he bore,
And in the doubtful war, before he won
The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town;
His banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine,
And settled sure succession in his line,
From whence the race of Alban fathers come,
And the long glories of majestic Rome.
O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate;
What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate;
For what offence the Queen of Heav'n began
To persecute so brave, so just a man;
Involv'd his anxious life in endless cares,
Expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars!
Can heav'nly minds such high resentment show,
Or exercise their spite in human woe?

Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away,
An ancient town was seated on the sea;
A Tyrian colony; the people made
Stout for the war, and studious of their trade:
Carthage the name; belov'd by Juno more
Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore.
Here stood her chariot; here, if Heav'n were kind,
The seat of awful empire she design'd.
Yet she had heard an ancient rumour fly,
(Long cited by the people of the sky,)
That times to come should see the Trojan race
Her Carthage ruin, and her tow'rs deface;
Nor thus confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway
Should on the necks of all the nations lay.
She ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in fate;
Nor could forget the war she wag'd of late
For conqu'ring Greece against the Trojan state.
Besides, long causes working in her mind,
And secret seeds of envy, lay behind;
Deep graven in her heart the doom remain'd
Of partial Paris, and her form disdain'd;
The grace bestow'd on ravish'd Ganymed,
Electra's glories, and her injur'd bed.
Each was a cause alone; and all combin'd
To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind.
For this, far distant from the Latian coast
She drove the remnants of the Trojan host;
And sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train
Were toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main.
Such time, such toil, requir'd the Roman name,
Such length of labour for so vast a frame.

Now scarce the Trojan fleet, with sails and oars,
Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores,
Ent'ring with cheerful shouts the wat'ry reign,
And plowing frothy furrows in the main;
When, lab'ring still with endless discontent,
The Queen of Heav'n did thus her fury vent:

""Then am I vanquish'd? must I yield?"" said she,
""And must the Trojans reign in Italy?
So Fate will have it, and Jove adds his force;
Nor can my pow'r divert their happy course.
Could angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen,
The Grecian navy burn, and drown the men?
She, for the fault of one offending foe,
The bolts of Jove himself presum'd to throw:
With whirlwinds from beneath she toss'd the ship,
And bare expos'd the bosom of the deep;
Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game,
The wretch, yet hissing with her father's flame,
She strongly seiz'd, and with a burning wound
Transfix'd, and naked, on a rock she bound.
But I, who walk in awful state above,
The majesty of heav'n, the sister wife of Jove,
For length of years my fruitless force employ
Against the thin remains of ruin'd Troy!
What nations now to Juno's pow'r will pray,
Or off'rings on my slighted altars lay?""

Thus rag'd the goddess; and, with fury fraught.
The restless regions of the storms she sought,
Where, in a spacious cave of living stone,
The tyrant Aeolus, from his airy throne,
With pow'r imperial curbs the struggling winds,
And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds.
This way and that th' impatient captives tend,
And, pressing for release, the mountains rend.
High in his hall th' undaunted monarch stands,
And shakes his scepter, and their rage commands;
Which did he not, their unresisted sway
Would sweep the world before them in their way;
Earth, air, and seas thro' empty space would roll,
And heav'n would fly before the driving soul.
In fear of this, the Father of the Gods
Confin'd their fury to those dark abodes,
And lock'd 'em safe within, oppress'd with mountain loads;
Impos'd a king, with arbitrary sway,
To loose their fetters, or their force allay.
To whom the suppliant queen her pray'rs address'd,
And thus the tenor of her suit express'd:

""O Aeolus! for to thee the King of Heav'n
The pow'r of tempests and of winds has giv'n;
Thy force alone their fury can restrain,
And smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main.
A race of wand'ring slaves, abhorr'd by me,
With prosp'rous passage cut the Tuscan sea;
To fruitful Italy their course they steer,
And for their vanquish'd gods design new temples there.
Raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies;
Sink or disperse my fatal enemies.
Twice sev'n, the charming daughters of the main,
Around my person wait, and bear my train:
Succeed my wish, and second my design;
The fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine,
And make thee father of a happy line.""

To this the god: ""'Tis yours, O queen, to will
The work which duty binds me to fulfil.
These airy kingdoms, and this wide command,
Are all the presents of your bounteous hand:
Yours is my sov'reign's grace; and, as your guest,
I sit with gods at their celestial feast;
Raise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue;
Dispose of empire, which I hold from you.""

He said, and hurl'd against the mountain side
His quiv'ring spear, and all the god applied.
The raging winds rush thro' the hollow wound,
And dance aloft in air, and skim along the ground;
Then, settling on the sea, the surges sweep,
Raise liquid mountains, and disclose the deep.
South, East, and West with mix'd confusion roar,
And roll the foaming billows to the shore.
The cables crack; the sailors' fearful cries
Ascend; and sable night involves the skies;
And heav'n itself is ravish'd from their eyes.
Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue;
Then flashing fires the transient light renew;
The face of things a frightful image bears,
And present death in various forms appears.
Struck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief,
With lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief;
And, ""Thrice and four times happy those,"" he cried,
""That under Ilian walls before their parents died!
Tydides, bravest of the Grecian train!
Why could not I by that strong arm be slain,
And lie by noble Hector on the plain,
Or great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields
Where Simois rolls the bodies and the shields
Of heroes, whose dismember'd hands yet bear
The dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!""

Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails,
Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails,
And rent the sheets; the raging billows rise,
And mount the tossing vessels to the skies:
Nor can the shiv'ring oars sustain the blow;
The galley gives her side, and turns her prow;
While those astern, descending down the steep,
Thro' gaping waves behold the boiling deep.
Three ships were hurried by the southern blast,
And on the secret shelves with fury cast.
Those hidden rocks th' Ausonian sailors knew:
They call'd them Altars, when they rose in view,
And show'd their spacious backs above the flood.
Three more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood,
Dash'd on the shallows of the moving sand,
And in mid ocean left them moor'd a-land.
Orontes' bark, that bore the Lycian crew,
(A horrid sight!) ev'n in the hero's view,
From stem to stern by waves was overborne:
The trembling pilot, from his rudder torn,
Was headlong hurl'd; thrice round the ship was toss'd,
Then bulg'd at once, and in the deep was lost;
And here and there above the waves were seen
Arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men.
The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way,
And suck'd thro' loosen'd planks the rushing sea.
Ilioneus was her chief: Alethes old,
Achates faithful, Abas young and bold,
Endur'd not less; their ships, with gaping seams,
Admit the deluge of the briny streams.

Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound
Of raging billows breaking on the ground.
Displeas'd, and fearing for his wat'ry reign,
He rear'd his awful head above the main,
Serene in majesty; then roll'd his eyes
Around the sp"

17088,"I remember 2013 like yesterday. The hype for this game was big. As a Grand Theft Auto fan who has played all of the games from the series, I agree that this one is the best GTA in many aspects. Graphics have improved hugely, talented voice actors, I was reacting to the game as if these characters were real. Jimmy and Lamar have to be my favourite side characters. Online is alright but I like story better, I will spend more time online trying to master that portion of the game too. Story however, is 4/5. I recommend everybody who plays video games  to try this, it's a must have game, the experience is one that remains in your heart."

The graphics are beautiful and impeccable, the views, scenery and NPC's that you can choose to interact with is hilarious. Depending on which neighborhood your in your always bound to stumble upon something new, secret, or just plain entertaining. The controls are sturdy and smooth, and although at first it may take time getting used to, this game will easily suck a minimum of 50-75 hours of your life and that's not even including the online version which is only being released October 1st.

17175,"Making Methamphetamine at home:

List of chemicals and materials: Diluted HCl - also called Muriatic acid - can be obtained from hardware stores, in the pool section

NaOH - also called lye

Ethyl Ether - aka Diethyl Ether - Et-0-Et - can be obtained from engine starting fluid, usually from a large supermarket. Look for one that says ""high ethyl ether content"", such as Prestone

Ephedrine The cottons in todays vicks nasle inhalers dont contain efed or pfed (ephedrin or psuedoephedrin) but there are still lots of easy ways to get good ephed or pfed, pure ephedrin can be extracted out of it's plant matter, from a plant that can be bought at most garden stores. Or you can get pfed from decongestive pills like sudafed. Most people perfer to work with pfed from pills rather then ephed from the plant. The important thing is that you must have pure pfed/ephed as any contaminants will fuck up the molar ratio leaving you with over-reduced shit or under-reduced shit. Or contaminats will jell durring baseifying and gak up your product which will then be very hard to clean. So you want to find a pill that is nearly pure pfed hcl, or as close to pure as you can get. Also check the lable on your pills and see what inactive ingredients they contain. Inactive ingredients are things like binders and flavors. These you dont want and will remove when cleaning your pills. but certain inactive ingredients are harder to remove then others. You dont want pills with a red coating, you dont want pills with alot of cellose in them and you dont want pills with much wax. you also dont want pills that contain povidone. As a rule, if you have a two pills that contain the same amount of pfed hcl then take the smaller sized pill because it obviously has less binders and inactive ingredients, time released pills are usualy harder to work with because they have more binders and tend to gel up durring the a/b stage. Also only buy pills that have pfed hcl as the only active ingredient. You first have to make ephedrine (which is sometimes sold as meth by itself):If you are selling it...I would just make ephedrine and say it's meth.

Distilled water - it's really cheap, so you have no reason to use the nasty stuff from the tap. Do things right.

List of equipment : A glass eyedropper

Three small glass bottles with lids (approx. 3 oz., but not important)one should be marked at 1.5oz, use tape on the outside to mark it (you might want to label it as ether). One should be clear (and it can't be the marked one).

A Pyrex dish (the meatloaf one is suggested)

A glass quart jar

Sharp scissors

Clean rubber gloves

Coffee filters

A measuring cup

Measuring spoons

Preparing your Lab:

Preparing Ethyl Ether: WARNING: Ethyl Ether is very flammable and is heavier than air. Do not use ethyl ether near flame or non-sparkless motors. It is also an anaesthetic and can cause respiratory collapse if you inhale too much.

Take the unmarked small bottle and spray starter fluid in it until it looks half-full. Then fill the rest of the way with water, cap the bottle and shake for 5 minutes. Let it sit for a minute or two, and tap the side to try and separate the clear upper layer. Then, draw off the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, and throw away the lower (water) and cloudy layer. Place the ether in the marked container. Repeat this until you have about 1.5 oz. of ether. Put the cap on it, and put it in the freezer if you can. Rinse the other bottle and let it stand.

Ethyl ether is very pungent. Even a small evaporated amount is quite noticeable.

Ephedrine & or P-Ephedrine: Please discuss this on the neonjoint forum

5. Pour 1/8 teaspoon of the lye crystals into the bottle of ephedrine and agitate. Do this carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air, avoid any flames as usual. Repeat this step until the mixture remains cloudy. This step neutralizes the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluble free base (l-desoxyephedrine) again. Why do we do this? So that we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities. For 3 oz. bottles, this should take only 3 repetitions or so.

6. Fill the bottle from step 5 up the rest of the way with ethyl ether. Cap the bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes. It is very important to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible. This will cause the free base to dissolve into the ether (it -is- soluble in ether).

7. Let the mixture settle. There will be a middle layer that is very thick. Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thin as possible. This is why this bottle should be clear.

8. Remove the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, being careful not to get any of the middle layer in it. Place the removed ether layer into a third bottle.

9. Add to the third bottle enough water to fill it half-way and about 5 drops of muriatic acid. Cap it. Shake the bottle for 2 minutes. When it settles, remove the top layer and throw it away. The free base has now been bonded to the HCl again, forming a water soluble salt. This time, we're getting rid of ether-soluble impurities. Make sure to get rid of all the ether before going to step 11!

10. If there is anything left from step 3, repeat the procedure with it.

11. Evaporate the solution in the Pyrex dish on low heat. You can do this on the stove or nuke it in the microwave (be careful of splashing), but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater (like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the remaining crystals will be ephedrine HCl.

If you microwave it, I suggest no more than 5-10s at one time. If it starts ""popping"", that means you have too little liquid left to microwave. You can put it under a bright (100W) lamp instead. Microwaving can result in uneven heating, anyway."

17238,I grew up with this game this is one of my game I had the most memories. I was a PlayStation 4 Player I still remember when I used to be a kid and hop on gta and just go to game chat and find people and invite them to my mc clubhouse and do arm wrestle and chill out and etc. Heist was a pain with friends we always fk around and stuff a heist that's supposed to take 30ish min takes up to 3 hours to just complete. The Most Fun things was RP it's always fun to do rps like cvc and hood rp where the host just yell at little kids eating their mic and etc which causes chaos to the lobby ffa etc. Then now 2022 Got a PC and everything decided to play this epic childhood game on my pc with a friend but we didn't know cross-save and etc wasn't a thing so that kinda ruin everything but I always wanted to do FiveM RPs when I was on PS4 so at the ended of the day I can still live with it.   Highly recommend this game with friends just hope you don't get murdered by mkii and jets Godmode was a huge problem on ps4 to this date with the new bunker moc god mode exploit and etc. And pLeaSe doN't bUy sHarK cards GrInD money urself it's fun and won't make GTA VI take 5 more years to release.

17244,"I only play online and I have alot of hours. The game is well done and pretty smooth but.. and this is a BIG BUT, its extremely inconsistent with controls between differing gameplay and the character controls are wonky AF.  About a year or so ago there was an update that changed the way things like enemy helicopters spawn in. Now they spawn above you instantly for most things and are untargetable cause like most games these days... you cant aim up.  I will not be getting the new GTAonline until I see these issues are not continued in the newer game. I cannot say how many times I have rage quit because of untargetable helicopters or because I would get stuck on a doorway after rounding a corner and ROCKSTAR doesnt seem to understand straifing unless you have a weapon aimed."

I'd love to play this game online with my friends, but it is absolutely unplayable in it's current state. It is a sad state of affairs for a game that could be so fun and enjoyable, but has only resulted in unending frustration for my friends and I."

17309,"Youll most likely never find a game that gets such support from a large AAA company, but still have so many hackers. Its not really a truly competitive game where hacking is going to get you ahead, at least as far as when it comes to killing or attacking other players. Its not CoD where its gonna up your K/D to show off or anything. Its totally infested with hackers because if theyre hacking and annoying other players they wont get banned because rockstar doesnt care. Its just generating money that get rockstars attention cuz theyre the ones hurting in that scenario. Theyre entirely powerless to modders that will ruin your experience, or carefree of it anyway. Console players woulld be in utter disgust if they booted up the PC version. Also, this game isnt a P2W freemium app game, but the grind is designed to make you want to drop some cash down on it. And the grind can be tedious when being harassed by hackers. I have a lot of hours into this game, and i wanted so much to be able to enjoy it, but rockstar got my money already so they dont have one care for my opinion."

17332,good soup
17333,Good times with friends
17334,This game banned me from Rockstar services because I hacked and I do not think it was fair the second time I got banned because I was not hacking and it was not my fault that a modder froze me in place and dropped a bunch of money and collectibles on me so I don't like Rockstar anymore because I have to buy a new game and make a new steam account to play this game and that's just very annoying to do so that's why I am writing this review I don't think it is cool to make someone spend even more money on the game and time on the game so im gonna have to spend 25 dollars to get a big shark card and a starter pack when I play this game again but it won't be on this steam account also I can't even play Red Dead Redemption 2 because of this ban so yeah now let me tell you about when I played the game because it was actually very fun to play with my friends I played with Erin and Grub and Path and we were in a cool squad and this was before I hacked  and Grub had a cool bunker off of the side of the main highway near the desert but it was in the mountains and you had to go past a bridge and we would always spawn our cars in missions and race around to see who would get to the mission the fastest and I didn't usually win because I had a slower car than Grub because he had the fastest car in the game in top speed but that's okay and we did a bunch of heists I remember the one where we had to try to kill everyone without being spotted by guards or cameras and we had to re-do it a bunch of times and I'm pretty sure you had to land a helicopter on the roof but because I am on mouse and keyboard I was very bad at it so I was never the pilot I think either Grub or Path were but not Erin for sure and we would just keep doing heists until everyone got the money they needed for houses and cars they wanted and my favorite car was the one that looks like the Bentley Continental GT because it just looked really nice and was pretty fast also I remember Erin had some car that was missing the windshield but was pretty fast but also very expensive and I didn't really like driving it that much but that is okay and then we slowly stopped playing the game because we got burnt out playing it and then we all just stopped talking and playing and that was the end of GTA but before that happened I got a modded client and started to do like stripper moves it was pretty funny on the yacht and I also had a lot of money afterwards and I might have given money drops but I never hacked in combat because I'm not bad like that but yeah that's pretty much when I stopped playing unfortunately it was a very good experience when we did play and it was very fun some of the most fun I've ever had but yeah glad it happened so anyways to recap the game itself is very fun but the fact that I got banned was okay but during my second chance I didn't hack and got banned is very stupid that I got banned and couldn't appeal also the game is still very pay to win there was no way we would have gotten all those heists done without Grub having a little bit of modded money so yeah that's the end of my review wait no it's not I played a lot of FiveM with my friends vinny and rocco and justin and tony and others I think and we played on a lot of servers and my characters name was Saddam Hussein which is actually where my username came from fun fact and my character's ped was called Armenian Lieutenant and that's where rocco's name also came from because his character was a middle eastern man I can't remember the ped name but he looked quite cool but that's where his RP name came from that turned into his username and it kinda just stuck and my friend vinny told me that his name was Frank in the game but I don't think he actually used that name afterwards he just stuck with Vinny but I should just tell you that we played FiveM way way way way way before it caught on on twitch it was actually a dying thing like there were barely any players and it was hard to find a full server and all of the servers that are now super popular had very little players so it's cool that we played the game and had fun while it was still not popular but the issue is that we got banned from a ton of servers because my friends would use servers with scripts enabled to run things like firescript and loaded diaper to crash servers bad but no one knows about it so if you see this then you now know how to crash the game but don't tell anyone or you're a snitch okay so that was my review and actually after thinking back I can't just not recommend the game because I got banned because it's a genuinely good game and I really enjoyed every hour I played of it so yeah I'm going to now recommend this game that was my review thanks for reading.

17358,"its good but its hard for starters, like for me i used to play on playstation and i just wasted money on shark cards to get money and buy stuff. I didnt think on what to spend it on, i just spent it on the stuff i thought looked cool. butt now since ive played the game for 2+ years i understand on how to get money, and with tutorials also helps. 

So I suggest this game for players that like to start from scratch.
I would not buy this game if you dont like starting from $10k.

ADIOS!"
17359,MODDERS I HATE
17360,even tho its about killing and sex there are some educational redeeming qualities about the game which i enjoy  and i recommend

17362,"do not go to the shoe icon highlighted on the map, it is not a shoe store.."
17363,"In my opinion GTA V is the most comprehensive Life simulator sandbox.

Story is still good as relevant today as it was in 2013 when the game was first launched.

The game comes together really nice from story , to graphics , mechanics , voice acting and all the little details.
You can just spend time walking around the city and you will be entertained, something will happen.

Online also came a long way ,plenty to do , death matches, races, heists, plenty of jobs missions and whatever you want.

It may be my computer but the waiting time is not as long as it used to when starting the game or going into sessions, or missions.

The big deal breaker for me is that there is a lot of griefing, you can't do anything in free mode without anyone blowing you to pieces. OR even ""better"" modders who make the game unplayable. 

10/10 looking for another session"

17399,"Ever since I saw the first gameplay trailer of this game when I was having my first playthrough of San Andreas back in 2013, I knew I had to play it. Now that I have, all I can say it was worth the damn wait. Fine story and great overall game considering other open world type games sometimes lack a bit too much of one aspect which kinda ruins the experience. Others may have good shooting, but the driving absolutely sucks or the story is just a joke. It's not a perfect game but I consider to be one of the best I have ever played. Also, this a very nice port considering the pc version of GTA 4 was not so good on the performance side."

It's hard to imagine how a GTA game could be more anti-fun in every possible way, up to and including the ability for even the most degenerate people to use mods online and turn an already awkward game experience into a complete waste of your time. The game cost a fortune to make and made a fortune, and it's clear they have done next to nothing to improve the game in meaningful ways since launch. I've been frustrated with plenty of games, this one actively makes me feel like a sucker, not from a money standpoint, but a sucker for having fun, like a bad carnival attraction.

On a positive note, the main characters in single player are very well-written and entertaining (when they aren't doing ham-fisted social commentary)."

17462,
17463,I know this is a great series but it's not really an old title yet and it's a bit fiddly to get it going because of the weird launcher. I think those things suck in general but it just gets in the way of what I bought the game for which is the story. I know lots of people are into multiplayer games but I've played my way through this series since the launch of gta 1 and just like taking my time with them.

17617,"GTA V Singleplayer:

The main story for GTA V is one that is full of adventure and things to do, especially if you don't want to deal with the hassle of Online. I have replayed the main story probably 25 times now over PS3, PS4 and PC and it never gets old, The story is one that can last a lifetime and can allow players to have a lot of fun with those new and old. Rockstar never failed to give an amazing singleplayer story throughout their games; However, they have several issues with online play...

GTA V Online: 

GTA V Online was an incredible addition to the game when it first came out, the opportunity to rob banks and do missions with other people was a blast, and it was a streamlined introduction to the world of GTA V Online. Now, there is just an over-abundance of new things that the game likes to shove in your face, like the new Contract and Los Santos Tuners updates. These other ""opportunities"" require you to have quite the sum of money in order to purchase these locations to do these newer missions. Or if you have Amazon Prime, the game would give most side opportunity locations for free. 

The Criminal Enterprise DLC added some free buildings for the biker club and allowed you to start a cocaine and money laundering business, however the locations were very far from central Los Santos and required you to drive a decent distance to reach it. The DLC also gave you a free property to start several opportunities as a CEO, this was also a barebones building that required millions of dollars to add an extra room or a new office style. 

Now for the main issue: Modders. Modding GTA V Online allowed these people to give themselves access to vehicles that are unattainable or incredibly expensive, Rockstar has tried to combat this by restricting them from giving themselves money so that they don't lose money from their Shark Cards which they sell at insane prices. $8,000,000 ingame for $130 isn't all that much considering that a single vehicle can end up costing that much and more. Modders can also give themselves access to whatever building they desire, make themselves invincible, blow up other players, crash players' games, force players to spam whatever they wish in chat, etc. These types of people make the game unbearable to play especially when i'm trying to just drive to a location. 

Overall, GTA V when it first came out was incredible, but now it has become a burning trash pile that will continue to get worse unless they fix the issues that are right in front of them."

pratically every single lobby has a at least one modder in it if not all. Aggressive modder by those means and even recently had one that literal closed everyone games in the entire lobby its that bad. Or they spam kill/blow up  lobies put them in cages and so forth. Until rockstar fixes the issue with modders anyone that wants to buy this game I highly discourage doing online mode or even buying the game at all. The modders jut make the game pratically unplayable. 


Not only that they sometimes ban people for ridicules reasons so I suggest not purchasing this game at all. Rockstar really needs to be taught a lesson somehow that they need to do something about this"

17701,"GTA 5's enhanced next-gen port is definitely the best way to experience the game, and it's still every bit the enjoyable experience it was in 2013. However, with almost a decade having passed since then, Los Santos has started to show its age. GTA 5 lacks the detail or cinematic presentation of Rockstar's own Red Dead Redemption 2. Animations look less fluid, melee combat feels antiquated, and gunplay - even with the addition of haptic feedback on the PlayStation 5's DualSense controller - lacks weight. RDR2 is still without its own next-gen upgrade, while Red Dead Online continues to languish without new content. Together with the official confirmation that GTA 6 is in development, this new port feels like a step backward when Rockstar should be looking to the future. It's still a great way to play Grand Theft Auto 5, but even with the visual improvements and new multiplayer content, it feels less like a necessary return, and more like an aimless jaunt."

17811,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

The core game is fun, the vehicles are nice and I'd say there's a lot to do in the game. It's fun by yourself or with friends, heists are nothing to write home about but are a plenty good way to enjoy yourself while making money.
However, modders and griefers can ruin your day and can be annoying, but I'd say it's overall worth the play.


[OFFLINE]
I think the story starts out slow but given a bit of time becomes gripping, the characters are interesting and the acting is good. Lots of fun missions to do. Overall very fun to complete."

17904,"The story mode is obviously good, some minor bugs occasionally that make me hate myself sometimes but mostly good!

The online mode however is just ass though, the game encourages you to buy shark cards to get more in game money, you don't actually have to pay for shark cards but the grind is just repetitive as hell if you don't, I never payed for shark cards and got pretty far into the game, but quit after awhile because of how long the grind takes to get 1 mil from a heist. Some heists only give you 250,000$ and take hours to complete. AND THE GAME HAS THE AUDACITY TO TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM YOU EACH TIME YOU FAIL UNTIL YOU HAVE NOTHING LEFT. So then your left with like 10 dollars after 5 hours of grinding one heist. Font get this game if you hate grinds."

17987,"You can have fun in the game..abosolutely...but if someone who mods, which just a nice way of saying performs various cheats, comes in the game and starts dropping items on you, which you dont even have to ask them to do (cause i've seen ppl in chat asking them to do it), till it causes error messages to pop up and you cant do anything anymore...you'll get banned for suspected cheating.  And you can not say anything to rock star about it.  they wont listen.  they just delete your char.  So dont waste your money on buying in game currency as i did just to get a ban caused by someone else since they so poorly admin there game."

18049,This game made me hate myself.
18050,The modders/Hackers are out of control. I deleted the game after a Hacker took control of the vehicle I was driving and drove me into the ocean then made all the local npc's attack me. Clearly that's not how the game was intended nor will I allow anyone to take control of my pc remotely. I'd love to leave a good review but honestly this game is a security risk at this point.

18057,"fun to replay story again, havent tried online due to bad reviews"
18058,I would recommend this game only if your playing single player and modding it or playing five m a modded client for PC only and there is no cross save so if you are coming from xbox or PS you should keep playing on your platform and stay with it i only have 103 hours cause i cheated myself into solo online sessions so i can grind cayo but otherwise i mostly use a mod menu on single player and enjoy it as it is funner then playing online in this game on pc cause it also has a bunch of hackers that dont care what you think and just grief you over and over again until you leave or the force crash your game and they just abuse the game and the devs dont care for the game no more cause there is still no anti-cheat and hackers get banned in 6 months then they just start cheating again

If you are suspended for any reason, it cannot be appealed, you will be given absolutely no information on the accusation, and everything you have done in the online will be reset."

(or use a VPN or a Proxy really far away from your home address, but modders can circumvent that easily I think and know your true IP, not sure of that)

We are still using peer to peer in 2022, incredible. 

I love Rockstar Games and their games but this is unacceptable."

I did buy it for the multiplayer but I found that to be laggy and very redundant so I went back to the single-player story-mode. Ended up uninstalling and I can't even refund because I have 2.3 hours on record. If they could just trim down the size and disconnect this always-online bullshit then the game would be a great purchase. As of now, just play it on your old console because its not that different and the PC version has more pop-in than the 360 version - fyi I have an RTX 2060 and an i7-8 gen so its not my resources that are lacking but rather how the game is programmed."

18269,"(Review of Online mode)

Good game, even though my account got suspended for 30 days because I did a glitch, Still a super fun game, love making money in this game by grinding, playing with friends is beyond fun as there is so many fun vehicles, jobs, weapons, activities, etc. The map is also great, big map, Bottom side is a big city with Industrial areas and residential areas, and the top part is mountains, villages, roads, and exploring is fun in this game. 

Best part about the game is making outfits and customizing cars. 
The variety of clothing in the clothing store, atleast 1500 pieces of clothing in total. You can buy masks to go with the outfit, there is no limits, making outfits is super fun because you can be super creative and just look cool.

Customizing cars to your liking is also awesome, you can own many garages and have a bunch of custom supercars or flying cars or whatever you wants, this game has. 

However there are a lot of griefers and modders who can sometimes ruin the fun of the game but its whatever, you can just join a new session and you still keep your stuff.

There are many properties and businesses to buy and upgrade and progress to make money, which is pretty cool, there are so many ways of making money in this game which is what I like. The variety of things in this game is amazing.
And the heists, great part of the game

Also just messing around and running over npcs with your cars is the best part lol

18331,"Somehow the online experience is comparable to TF2. What an achievement.
Modders can/will spawn themselves next to you & spawn 1million explosions right on you, every time you respawn. They have also ruined some of my missions by spawning in collectibles & giving me vehicles I probably shouldn't own at my level, as well as free cash.

The legit players can actually be really helpful & willing to hop in your car & complete missions, whilst some other players will just shoot on sight

More bugs than Lester's crotch. I had to drive 20km in a slow ass truck to deliver supplies that didn't even want to go in my bunker & then Agent 14 told me I fucked up.  Speaking of bunkers, this is all so confusing for new players. Why is there 200 flying bikes with homing missiles that I can't avoid in every server?


This game seems really good until you actually start to get into it.

Rockstar seem to be following the multi-billion dollar game company trend:
Make a great game. 
Continue to generate immense amounts of profit over multiple years. 
Watch the game rot. 
Put as little effort as possible into the game because you know idiots will still purchase all the micro-transactions & use that as validation for the lack of effort put into maintaining the game.


So, no, I can't recommend the game in this state. Reviews should be about gameplay & aesthetics, not how complacent game devs can become üòï"

I almost didnt click Yes because of the big modder issue in GTA V Online, but the game still has hope for players who have friends. Overall Modders in this game are going to be the end of it, but enjoy it while you can with your friends before GTA VI comes out, and stay away from modders, dont let a modder peer pressure you into getting a mod menu, not only will GTA become boring to you because of how easy the game is now with a mod menu, but you might also get banned. Really in conclusion I'm just saying you should install this game and play it with your friends, but avoid modders, even if you have to find a new session, and I know I haven't said much about what kind of fun you can have, but that's for you to find out and explore with your pals."
18382,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

You can't do heists cause you don't own an apartment, you need money, so you either steal a thousand cars or/and rob stores, or play a missions solo which are kinda hard an time consuming for little reward... or play online :)
So if you are someone like that likes to play solo, or don't have any friends, buy this game only for the story mode, cause online is not playable :)"

18619,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

18642,"Ok guys, I just saw Minions 2: The Rise of Gru (2022) in theaters and it is the BEST movie I have ever watched. Even better than Morbius (2022) !!!1!!1!1!)! I expect 100 gruzillion tickets to be sold, a box office of 1 minionillion dollars worldwide for the first time ever, and a #MinionsSweep at the 2023 Academy Awards.

My favorite scene was when Gru said ‚ÄúOh yeah, it‚Äôs minioning time!‚Äù and proceeded to commit mass vehicular minionslaughter. It really said a lot about the social class system in our society.

I was furiously masturbating throughout the lengthy and artistic sex scene between Kevin and Bob. My banana throbbed every time a minion said ‚Äúbanana‚Äù.  On the way out of the theater, I apologized to the manager and offered to clean the cum off the floor, seat, and family in front of me. I explained to him that I am the highest class of male, the Minion Male, and he was very understanding.

After the film, I emptied my life‚Äôs savings and bought all of the Minions merchandise from every retail establishment in a 50 mile radius of my mommy‚Äôs house because this memorabilia will be worth minionillions of Gru-coin one day. My bitch mom didn‚Äôt understand and kicked me out of the house, so i am writing this review from the Wendy‚Äôs dumpster.

I urge all of you to view this cinematic masterpiece immediately as I am sure it will shatter all of the records Morbius set and will be considered the greatest film of all time!"

My only complaint is Rockstar is not doing a good enough job of keeping the hackers and modders out. They have overtaken nearly every public server on PC and kill any fun you would have in the game. Don't bother buying shark cards since people can just hack and mod their way to riches for free. It is a much better experience on console, since it is much harder (impossible?) to hack/mod on console. Overall, still worth the money and definitely worth playing with friends."

18844,"I'll keep this brief, because I could go on and on about what I do and don't like about this game. To put it simply, its a great game that has lived well past its prime. That being said, story mode was and always will be decent. The online scene is another story though... grindy, malicious, and often overrun by modders. While I completely understand that theres a money making model to this game, Rockstar and their parent companies have made literally no effort to hide it, with new items reaching stratospheric costs, and the only way to get there with any relative speed being to purchase Shark Cards. While you can get there, eventually, good luck dodging the griefers. That said, can still be a fun game at times. Just gotta know what youre getting into."

18885,Rockstar does not care about modders cheating online. they will grief you. They will literally make the game unplayable. They will attempt to blow out your speakers. They will ruin your missions and cheat in pvp. Rockstar does not care. Do not give them your money. This game is a scam at this point. Literally the worst online experience of any game I've ever played an it's entirely because they aren't stopping griefers and cheaters.

18904,"you know in all GTA games all you really do is drive from one point to another and something happens and you start shooting people. I have no idea why it is fun but it is. the only reason to buy this game now, 8 years after release is the story. it's like watching a heist movie. you can come back and do the heists differently to see what happens if you had made a different choice. 
as for the online part, I didn't even try it."

In spite of the fact that it's been out for a very long time, it's a really good game with a great story mode and decent online play. Has some sporadic, far and few-in-between updates, but that's fine considering they don't release them as DLCs and charge you for it. 

Most of the issues stem from imbalances in online play, and other players being mean-spirited at times in general, but other than that there's tons of content. 

One major issue is how grindy things are in online play and how hard it is to earn money, even using the most efficient heists. There's a lack of variety in that sense, if you're looking to make money fast. Also, every new update releases more and more expensive properties, vehicles etc that aren't anywhere near worth it. If you like to grind for money etc, then you'll love it. Don't purchase shark cards. Regardless, the story mode alone is very much worth it if multiplayer isn't for you."

You can play online, redo the story to 100% it, discover secrets and devote your time to bullshit things. GTAO is an endlessly expanding version of the game which is really fun to play if u got some time and are bored. GTA is worth the price but if u wanna get back into it after taking a break, I do recommend buying it on sale just incase it is not your savvy."

18962,"Story:  Really fun, interesting story with plenty of weapons to choose from and unique stories behind the three characters.  Each of the characters has good personality traits that balance the others and make the story interesting.  Michael is harsh and rude, but is reasonable and tries to better himself despite how he feels about things at times.  More often you won't see that side, but during the end you can really see him trying to change.  Franklin is more timid and unsure about things and is often pulled into things that he wasn't wanting to be a part of in the first place.  But as the story progresses Franklin becomes more sure of himself and tries to make something out of his life of crime, and even tries to settle down once you settle the final score.  He acts as the middleman of comedy and seriousness between Michael and Trevor as well.  Speaking of Trevor, while he be absolutely insane, he does have some reasoning.  That's about as much as I can say, aside from the fact that he is the best character.
Online:  Grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind.  That's all you do if you want literally anything in the game.  There are more weapons now, but the latest weapons cost about 400,000 in game currency, which is equivalent to about $10 of real-life currency.  There are also the yachts, which cost 8,000,000 in game currency.  This is equivalent to $100 real life dollars.  Finally, there is the kosatka, the money maker.  With all of the upgrades, if I am remembering correctly, the kosatka costs 9.5 million dollars in game.  That is about $120 real life dollars.  The best way of making money in this game is buying a menu that rigs the roulette table so you can slowly make 180k per game, which takes about 45 seconds.  Even with cheating, it still takes a horrendous amount of time to be able to purchase anything, especially now that every goddamn car cost 2.2 million to buy.  Without upgrades.

I am recommending this game for the story mode.  I will still continue to waste my time on the online, but I can't recommend it for you."

18965,"Rockstar has had years to produce better content than that of GTA5. 

Instead they exploited it's player base with hundreds of DLCS and other money grabbing schemes.

GTA6 already sounds like a disaster and I haven't even seen a trailer.

There is no real story that you can relate to here while playing this game, too far fetched and outright gross.

Roleplay videos on Youtube are not what you get when you play GTA5 Online, don't fall for that trap.

Best to just play up until 4 and skip this and not pay Rockstar anymore money what they deserve.

You are not missing anything here you're not getting in San-Andreas, since online is boring.

And nothing beats San-Andreas anyways.

P.S. Fix your Red Dead Redemption Universe, seriously."

18998," I was playing this game and then one day out of the blue I got a message that stated that I was suspended from the game. I was grinding my butt off then they suspended me from the game for no reason. And even after that message popped up I had to wait A whole month for me to even play the game. I was not hacking the game, glitching the game or anything, just one day they decided to get another guy playing the game A hard time. I had gained 12 million bucks worth of properties and offices and whatever else and they took it away from me and I cannot forget the pack that I bought for this game that immediately went down the drain. If Rockstar gave me that back I wouldn't complain, but they did not as of yet give me a reasonable explanation for why that suspension happened. I am still going to keep the game but I DON'T RECOMMEND IT ANYMORE."

19003,"The cash-grab from Rockstar is gross, and the PC version of this game isn't perfect, but overall GTA V is just a good game. Story is pretty capitvating and the world is excellent."
19004,"Despite the current state of Grand Theft Auto Online, with it being full of modders, griefers and hackers alike, it is still very good fun to play. However, I would personally stick to invite only or friend sessions because you can still play a lot of the activities available in the game from there without having to be in a public lobby of said modders, griefers and hackers alike.

The Story Mode part of the game is a lot of fun too. It is has an interesting story line that keeps you playing for hours. There is also a lot of fun gameplay which makes the whole atmosphere feel alive and immersive - especially with all the characters own unique personalities and special abilities.

In conclusion, it is definitely worth a buy, even if it is just for the story mode because from there you can get a lot of fun.

HOWEVER, if you wanna play online and you have to start from nothing. DONT BUY THIS.
The entire game is pay to win. You are basically grinding to get past the next paywall just so you can do more grinding. Don't expect to buy anything cool if you're not ready to spend ALOT of time grinding or buy sharkcards (in-game currency). 

I've been playing the game since 2013, i'm lvl 166 and im STILL grinding for everything because i refuse to buy any sharkcards..."

Fortnite Battle Royale sets itself apart by trading the traditional, bland military simulation vibe with vivid colors and an outstanding, freeform building system that‚Äôs unlike anything else in competitive multiplayer games.As its name suggests, Fortnite Battle Royale fits so neatly into the battle royale genre that blew up last year that the basic description sounds as standard as you can get: Up to 100 players are dropped onto a large but constantly shrinking map with the goal of gathering weapons and gear to become the last person or team left standing. But if you look just a little closer, it can‚Äôt be mistaken for any other game because the vehicle you‚Äôre skydiving out of is, inexplicably, a flying party bus ‚Äì a nice change of pace from a drab military plane ‚Äì and the place you land is a giant, beautifully colorful island, instead of a realistic landscape, surrounded by a violent storm.
Thankfully, unlike other battle royale games, like PlayerUnknown‚Äôs Battlegrounds, where an unlucky circle could leave getting out of the encroaching circle almost impossible, Fortnite‚Äôs map is at least small enough (relative to PUBG‚Äôs) that even if you have to run across the entire island to get to the safety of the randomly centered eye of the storm you run very little risk of being killed by the collapsing border.
On the island are several large and totally unique cities, each with their own style of structures ‚Äî a quaint suburb of houses, a giant office district filled with skyscrapers, or a retail area with an outdoor mall. Each city is full of vibrant colors, and the map as a whole has hundreds of buildings with randomly spawning loot in the form of guns, explosives, and healing items.
Wait, Which Fortnite Is This? Developed by Epic Games, Fortnite was originally conceived as a third-person, co-op, survival game where teams of players could mine resources and build structures to hold off hordes of undead enemies. That version, now a standalone game called Fortnite
Fortnite Battle Royale‚Äôs inventory management is, thankfully, simple by design. You get just five slots, so you‚Äôre forced to balance your arsenal of guns with your need for healing or explosives to deal with enemy structures. It‚Äôs a neat limiting factor that forced me to keep a mental shopping list of exactly what I was on the lookout for as I ran across the island, and to resist the urge to pick up anything else. With such specific needs in mind, every chest came with the thrill of hoping it would reveal the weapons I wanted most. Fortnite gives you plenty of ways to mix and match weapons, so even if that chest doesn‚Äôt come up with the exact item you want, you‚Äôll never feel powerless in a fight.
Once you do find the weapons you‚Äôre looking for, most fights in Fortnite go about the same way: You start with one shot from a slow-firing heavy weapon like a sniper rifle or pump shotgun in hopes of ending the fight before it really started, then (if needed) switch over to a faster assault rifle or tactical shotgun to carry out the rest of the battle. While it‚Äôs far from the only way to play, this combination seems to be the preferred method for almost every player and provides the foundation of almost every fight in Fortnite.
It‚Äôs a chaotic and fun system that makes fights a little more complicated.
It‚Äôs a lightning-fast system where fights can end in the blink of an eye with just one slight miss. This makes for a stark contrast from other battle royale games like PlayerUnknown‚Äôs Battlegrounds, which is filled with long, tense standoffs where sustained accuracy often matters more than a single well placed shot. It‚Äôs a chaotic and fun system that makes fights a little more complicated than simply aiming at your opponent and firing, but after a few hours with Fortnite I started to get the shoot-and-switch rhythm down and fights started to become almost automatic.
It‚Äôs the stuff around the shooting that helps Fortnite differentiate itself from every other battle royale game and shows off what truly makes it special: The building.
Carrying over the building system from Save the World is a brilliant choice that sets Battle Royale apart not just from other battle royale games, but most competitive multiplayer games in general. Just about everything that isn‚Äôt the ground can be mined for wood, stone, or steel, which can be used to create walls, stairs, and floors anywhere on the map (so long as some part of the structure touches the ground). It‚Äôs a massive system with so many possibilities that, at first blush, it can be daunting to try to figure out how to build the massive structures that others around you have created. But that‚Äôs one of the best things about Fortnite: It always keeps things simple.
That‚Äôs one of the best things about Fortnite: It always keeps things simple.
With just three primary tiles ‚Äì floors, walls, and stairs ‚Äì the building toolset may seem limited, but it‚Äôs got everything you really need. Whether it was building a staircase up to that hard-to-reach loot chest or quickly laying down an impromptu piece of cover to protect from an attacking enemy, I found I always had the tools I needed for the job at hand, and I could swap to the piece I needed without missing a beat. In fact, that swapping is so easy that one of my favorite moves is placing one platform and jumping off of it, then switch to another type in mid-air and place it before I land. That trick allows you to scale vertical walls or go straight up a mountain. While this may sound like an impressive feat of dexterity, Fortnite makes it so simple that almost anyone can pull it off ‚Äì and they do, making it one of the most common tricks to getting around the island.
The first time I really understood how Fortnite‚Äôs building and shooting played into one another came in the middle of a fight in Retail Row, one of the map‚Äôs many cities. Another player and I were sheepishly taking shots at one another from behind single walls we had built. After I ran out of ammo in my assault rifle, I was forced to turn to my shotgun ‚Äì a weapon I had largely disregarded up until this point. With the few resources I had left, I built stairs over my opponent‚Äôs wall, jumped off, flipped around, and shotgunned him. Looking back, it was as routine a play as it gets, but it was an absolute revelation for me at the time. Suddenly, everything made sense, and I realized that Fortnite Battle Royale is more about building than it is about shooting.
While the little things you can use it for may seem obvious ‚Äì like building stairs to get to the roof of a building, or making a wall to block an enemy‚Äôs shots ‚Äì the system also gives you room to think outside the box. You could build around a downed teammate that you can‚Äôt help yet, or create a decoy fort to lure enemies into an ambush while you wait behind a tree. The system even provides some elegant solutions to getting caught outside the trademark random circles of the battle royale genre: If you find yourself on the wrong side of a lake or chasm, no problem ‚Äì just make your own bridge to the other side.
One player lured me into his elaborate fortress of hallways in hopes of forcing me toward his waiting shotgun at the end of the maze.
Thanks to the building system‚Äôs simple but robust design, you can throw structures together in a way that suits your style. While some people love high towers that stretch into the sky, I like to keep things at a lower altitude, giving me more room to bounce between my platforms and the ground. One player I faced lured me into his elaborate fortress of hallways, with doors that led to nothing, all in hopes of forcing me toward his waiting shotgun at the end of the maze."

19081,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing"

There's no escaping them without just leaving the session. A real shame honestly, as there are some features of online that can only be accessed in public servers (which I wish would be changed because I hate playing with other people online, especially in this game with such annoying, toxic players).

Want to have some good ole pvp fun?  Good luck, 75% of the people still playing this will have a mod with god mode on, or just hit you with so many mods you have to close your game because it becomes unplayable.  If you waited until this long to play GTA V, just save your money and play something else, because these days, it isn't worth the frustration you have to put up with just to have and even slightly enjoyable experience.

19225,"This game saved my life

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

It‚Äôs not to say GTA V doesn‚Äôt have its issues - the main ones being, in typical Rockstar fashion, an overly limiting mission structure and a clunky control and movement design that is especially frustrating when indoors and handling vehicles. But this is a case where the positives far outweigh the negatives to deliver an awesome overall gaming experience. Even though the story suffers from some continuity problems and even a lack of logic here and there, it was actually a lot more interesting than I thought it would be. The aggressiveness in tone and themes was one of the most prevalent traits in previous GTA titles, and it‚Äôs great to see it refined here, even if it‚Äôs done in a more over the top, caricatural way. Being able to jump between three very different characters, all with their particular personalities, strengths, storylines and business opportunities to explore, was in my opinion the best new addition to the franchise considering the depth it offers. And of course, the game‚Äôs strongest point: the world. The setting GTA V was able to create is nothing short of wonderful. There‚Äôs so much to do, so much to see, so much variety in terms of scenery, interactions, side quests, investments and mindless activities, that I can see anyone easily sinking 100+ hours into it without feeling a bit of boredom. This may not be not my favourite GTA in terms of atmosphere, but it‚Äôs certainly the one with the most accomplished world, and I now get why it serves as the blueprint for the formula that so many of the open world games that came after tried to capture.

I‚Äôm sure nothing I‚Äôve said here is new, but I still wanted to share my thoughts for the few people out there who haven‚Äôt tried this game yet and are wondering if it‚Äôs still worth it in 2021. To my mind, it 100% is. Even factoring in its flaws, GTA V is a fantastic game and a fully realised satire of modern day crime, fun, consumerism, routines and stereotypes, in a world that feels connected and constantly engaging. A straight A, 5/5 experience in my book.

EDIT: Honestly didn't realise this game had become so divisive over the years, but I can understand why. Perhaps it's because a) I have zero experience with GTA online (I don't do multiplayer), and b) I played both SA and GTA 4 when they came out, so it's a long time for me to draw full comparisons between 5 and those earlier games even though I remember liking both of those more. Also, to be clear: even though it suffers from some of the same issues, RDR2 is IMO a much better game than GTA V in almost every single way, no doubt in my mind about that whatsoever."

19243,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching some tiktok videos. So i decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

19244,yes
19245,"Finally got around to playing through the entire campaign. Chased down most of the extra missions I could and most were unique with minimal repetitiveness. All in all Rockstar maintains it's reputation for amazing storytelling.
Multiplayer was plenty of fun in it's early days but has now devolved into who has the more wackier and deadly machines, friends are a must if you want to grind out cash with any sort of fun. If all else fails just go Play to Win and purchase some shark cards, it's sad thats what it's come to."

you start to watch gta v on youtube and then you realize it takes a lot of credit cards / skill to max/buy everything in gta online so you quit online.

then you install mods for fun and after sometime it gets repetitive and you get bored, and then you realize that your friends don't even play the game, then you quit.

i recommend it only if you have at least 1 friend that also plays the game, if not after 100-300 hours it gets super boring."
19418,Best game

19433,I took a very kind lady on a drive to alleyway
19434,the game is fun if you play it with a puerto rican girl
19435,"Loved this franchise since its inception with GTA I. This game is extremely entertaining (online) -- as long as there is no cheating afoot in the session you happen to find yourself spawned into. If that's the case then it's totally worth your funds. I won't even attempt to go into all the various reasons GTA is fantastic, because it has all been said. If you're even remotely on the fence, just buy it."
19436,Good game.But when will the Grand Theft Auto VI come out?
19437,very nice
19438,Online is just a shitshow. This game has so many problems with it. Its really not worth it. Get it for the singleplayer not online.
19439,9 out of 10 public sessions are modded.
19440,"tldr: great game ruined by cash-grabbing company and humans being humans.

story mode is good, online is crap, unless you go to a private lobby (which can be ok as long as you don't want to buy anything in-game, 'cause you won't make any money there) or hack your way into a player-only public session. they force you to public mode that is filled with griefers who have been playing for decades or modders and you have no chance of completing any of the objectives except through session hopping and hope. i guess that funnels more folks into just buying shark cards, so they have 0 incentive to change anything.

on deep discount sale, get it, play story mode, don't bother with any of the online stuff outside of single player, otherwise pass. online, it's a bunch of beautiful scenery, wasted on a shitty game.

*just as an aside... this game is so bad when it's bad that i'll never buy another r* game. they burned this bridge.

**another aside... for all it's faults, this is a really good port, probably the best i have played on steam. going from keyboard/mouse to controller and back is so seamless."

19462,Thrilling.
19463,Honestly a pretty good game. But RockStar dosen't know how to run a game. There are so many modders your account and even yourself in real life are in danger. You can play on PC and get banned when it not your fault or hunt down for modders fun or you can play on console with no modders but be playing at 15 FPS. If RockStar used their billions of dollars to fix the game easily could be the best game ever. Can really only recommend story mode.

The online mode is basically going from point A to point B while trying not to loose your sanity.
You are more likely to win a lottery than find a full session without either a hacker or someone with a hacked account.
If you enjoy getting your shit blown up, your IP getting leaked, someone using your name to write questionable things in the game chat, everything you do being ruined, your game crashing and spending hours of repetitive grinding just to afford a car (which will get blown up too) then GTAO is a game for you."

In all honesty, GTA online has the potential to be an extremely good multiplayer game, however is held back by a few major issues. greed from Rockstar is extreme, modders are everywhere and the loading screens are atrocious, but all of this is bearable when playing with friends and can be a lot of fun. i have spent way too long on this game on xbox so was happy to join online on the PC. This was ruined however by the fact that there auto ban system doesn't work at all, and that Rockstar will neither appeal or given reason to said ban. As far as i can tell, either this was a mistake or i was banned for being to efficient with one of the available businesses (that being the auto shop when on double money, which i made upwards of 10m from in 2 days). I would recommend this game, but only if you have a PS5/Xbox Series X/S as to allow for actual play-ability without the risk of false bans or constant hacking issues. that way you only have to deal with the icocnically bad loading screens"

19605,"This is a really fun game, even in 2022. The only real issue I see with this game is the online mode and how it's almost a job to work the game and make cash but the reality is they want you to buy the micro-transactions.

The game was supposed to get some sort of single player DLC but they bailed on that and just started calling every update to online a 'DLC'. With that being said the DLC really delivers big time, you got flying cars and jet bikes that have homing missile capabilities, big command ship style where people man the guns and artillery while someone pilots. Submarine, bunkers, yachts 'illegal activities' like drug/money laundering schemes to line your pockets... It's all incredibly expensive to get into and you will be stuck grinding for hours on end to save up a million dollars for a ceo's office which then requires another big time investment. 

Everything costs over a million dollars which is like hours and hours of grinding, its nuts."

Again the multiplayer in this game will celebrate 10 years soon. And it becomes worse year after year. 
If you casn have fun shooting around driving a tank or smth like that, then you probably may ask your parents to buy GTA V. If you are older than 21 - just do not spend money on that. Try to buy a car or visit your local shooting range - brings much more gta vibe along with.. I don't know. spending more time with friends."

Instead, I played the Single-player campaign with the Gta 5 Redux mod (Great mod!) and it was a blast.

The story isn't anything special, its your bog-standard ""bank robber"" story with a bit of a unique twist, yet somehow it feels so magical. Despite how 'empty' the storymode is, the game does a great job at bringing you close to each character and letting you really get to know who you're playing as.

19685,"This review is for GTA V Online, not the singleplayer GTA V. GTA V's singleplayer is great for what it is but most people buying this game in 2022 will be purchasing it for the online experience.

GTA V Online has such an amazing groundwork. A beautiful map, tons of content, and a plethora of things to do.

All of the above features are thrown out the window by the amount of modders and cheaters in the game. While many people would argue that there aren't that many of them or that they don't affect the experience, both of these statements are just untrue. From my experience, almost every public lobby has at least 1-2 modders in it. These ""modders"" and the amount they can do outside the game's boundaries is absolutely unacceptable.

They can spawn unobtainable vehicles, become invincible, fly, explode the entire map, teleport, become NPCs such as animals, lock you into a cage, crash your game instantly, and many other things. If this wasn't enough, they can violate your privacy. They can force you to type things into chat and even SEE YOUR IP ADDRESS. Having a VPN does not help this.
Your first thought would be to report these people to Rockstar, correct? Well. Modders get alerts when you send a report through the game, which allows them to delete them before they even reach Rockstar. That's right. You can't even report these cheaters which can be an actual threat to your game experience, your Rockstar account, and your real-world well being.

On top of all this, Rockstar as a company is just completely awful. They have taken most customer support down for the game, so most email reports will not work to get any cheaters banned even with video proof. However, they do have ban waves in which they ban accounts of suspected cheaters every month or so. Hilariously, my account was falsely banned for 30 days and my entire character reset. All of the 95.4 hours you see at the time of writing this review was erased for existing in a lobby with a modder, something out of my control and completely without my consent. I had never received a warning nor committed any offense on my GTA or Social Club account before this.

This game is outdated, not supported by the developers, and swarming with cheaters that can put you at risk.
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR THE ONLINE."

19728,"The single player experience is decent: the story is engaging, the missions are sometimes uninspired but pretty much always fun, thanks to the passable gun and vehicle handling which sits somewhere squarely in the middle of realism and arcade. 

The online experience is cancerous, if not downright unplayable however. Hackers run rampant and unpoliced, and the overall culture of the playerbase even among those who play fairly is extremely toxic and utterly incompatible with getting any enjoyment out of the online missions the game has to offer. 
What's more, there is no reliable way to play the online content without these hooligans. Even the option to enter a ""crew only"" session (a session of only yourself and those you invite) heavily restricts the content you can do online to the point of making me wonder why it even exists. 

Play the single player if the game goes on a huge sale. Hard pass on the online content, unfortunately."

GTA online is a grind, the updates are free with content but you really have to grind in this game. it can be a literal part time job. The story progresses nice but lets be honest who hasn't done it 100X by now. All I'm saying is there's a point when you just have to start fresh. Its been time to release a new game for awhile now..."

19872,"This game is really fun to play. For someone who never played a story based game, I'm having a spectacular time in this game.
The story is well written and organized, the switching between the characters is amazing.
I highly recommend it."
19873,fun when modded
19874,haha shoot people
19875,"Its GTA5 great game, only thing is it takes to long to load into the game and the rockstar launcher is terrible. but one of my favorite games of all time. offline and multiplayer great times! 9/10 near perfect game."
19876,Great game when you want a new experience. The story mode is immersive and makes it easy to lose track of time. You'll forget to go outside and touch grass from the amount of content this game has to offer. GTA V Online allows you to play with random people and friends too. I recommend this game for anyone and everyone. Only losses points because the Oppressor Mk 2 is absolute garbage.

19906,Pretty good game
19907,"gta online has more hackers/modders than actual regular players, it's extremely annoying that each session you have issues caused by other players, sometimes you lose money or items you have been grinding for hours,  and sometimes they wont let you play or make your game crash, but it happens every time. singleplayer is ok, and online would be great but obviously rockstar doesnt give  a shit about their costumers, so unless you can play this game online with only trusted people in a close session, this game is absolute shit."
19908,Trevor is a wonderfully violent and funny character and his entrance is memorable and really shakes the game up.

19935,And maybe if your lucky you'll become a three-bit gangster... Its bs. Go to school were you can screw people and get paid for it.
19936,"GTA single experience: It is normal fare and the progression to it is to be expected from past generations.

However the biggest gripe is the lack of money consistently being doled out.  There are only a few missions that dole out money.

There is that one ""bug"" with the underwater suitcases of money that Rockstar placed in there to see if people will exploit and almost everyone did -- obviously because the majority of players were given scarcity proposition so most were hesitant to spend any money throughout the campaign.

GTA Online: It is for the grinder and for those that have friends to mess around with. I would recommend to have an invite only sessions.

For those that go into the public sessions, GTA:O becomes a test of patience and resolve for the new players. Some of the practices are ""realistic"" but they quickly lead into some toxic behaviors which will attract mostly an aggressive player base.  Passive grinders be wary of the other players and learn how to read the atmosphere of the lobby that you are in before doing any high paying sell missions.

If you meet godmode cheaters and modders out for griefing, only recourse is to leave for a new online session and hope some more.

Currency is still an issue that makes GTA Online play like a gacha game -- forced to spend money on the shark cards.  What's worse is that the shark cards were not adjusted for the inflation of the in-game items so R* could get more out of their whale players.

If you heard of GTA Online Plus, it is just a slap on the face with the pittance of benefits that it offers. It's plain anticonsumer.

If you abuse any of the glitches and make millions at the hour, R* will ban you easily but the godmode KD warriors and modders are easy to find.  Every day you will find a handful mucking around, just be glad if they aren't messing with you."

19949,"This game is an absolute trash heap. Its riddled with cheaters and the developers have no idea what the players actually want. Most of the content is useless and everything is overpriced. The additions that are somewhat interesting are actually extremely shallow are repetitive. Rockstar seems to promote griefing resulting in the players who are just trying to mind their own business, trying to make some money; getting blown to shit every time they try to sell anything."

19987,"Probably the best game I have ever played in my life, it's such a shame that this game has so many game breaking issues. I have never had more good memories, nostalgia and downright fun as I have had from this game. 

If the following things were done, this game would be almost flawless imo:

Heavily nerf or remove the Oppressor MK II

Heavily nerf or remove the orbital canon

Add a good anti-cheat to stop the rampant griefing cheaters

Allow players to disable public chat"
19988,good game for people who are bored

20014,"come on everyone loves the gta  series and i should not have to say why,its broke records and in my opinion it is the best game even still today, and for many years to come other game developers try to make a game like this but cant succeed saints row' cyberpunk'watch dogs they just cant make an RPJ game as good as rockstar can, and will never be able to. The story is perfect and not just that Easter eggs are crazy, and leave you thinking whats the back story to this mount chilliad the mysteries just the excitement the game brings to  fans and new players is something better than just opening up random brand new game you want to check out no gta is a game that you know is good and you know you will love this game its  honestly revolutionary compared to all the RPJ games in my life, and if you have played story mode long enough hop on online and play with friends, take on big scores and make mad racks and get amazing cars property business and much much more."

20023," great game and really funny
"
20024,"One of the best games of all time. But it's a money grab at this point. Buy it on sale and install FiveM! 
GTA online is a biggest grift in video game history. It's full of trolls and cheaters. Support a FiveM server instead :-)"
20025,"pretty good game, reconmend staying away from public modders"
20026,i like running over people
20027,"If you buy this for use by multiple people on a single laptop (family sharing) you're wasting your money, they market the game itself as DLC so that one device needs to buy it X amount of times for each individual account. Shit marketing practices, don't buy, just download it free from somewhere so the company loses money."

Fyi if a hacker has an okay ish cheating client they can see your IP-address, where you live, your internet provider and they can pretend to be you inn game.

The story mode is good. However, it does not weigh up for the lack of professionalism in online from rockstar games

20156,"The game refuse to be fix or open wasted too much money on it
"
20157,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

20187,"Well, I know I'm behind the line on this one having not picked GTA up since it was released in 2013. I deserve to go to prison for that alone tbh - quite brilliant game which surely must have had some updates/refurb as looks stunning and not like any 2013 game I've ever played before. Story mode is funny at times and with some good heists and tasks to keep hundreds of hours in the game. Trevor is a thing of beauty. 

Buy it, but clear a few days from work first and check in with the wife and children to make sure they are still alive, at least every 8 hours.

20256,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
20257,"Hello everyone this is my first time giving a game a long review.

For me personally Grand Theft Auto V has been game I have been playing for years across multiple different platforms and having fun on all of them. I first started playing this back on the Playstation 3 and then went to the Playstation 4 and now to PC. In total I probably have around 5-8k hours in the game across all of the platforms. In all of those hours I have had a lot of time to get opinions about the game in multiple different ways regarding Story mode and Online, I am going to start with online.

[b] Online [/b]
I started playing the online part of GTA in around 2016 and that's when it all started and I fell in love with the game. Playing hundreds apon hundreds of races to get cars and whatever else I wanted to get that looked like something I wanted, along with the many different exploits that were in the game that made the game fun. Moving on to the PS4 and PC where I have a lot of my time in the game which I am around level 200 on PS4 and around 270 on PC. Primarily doing heists and just relaxing playing with my friends in lobbies and having a great time, Playing the game with friends is so much fun and rather then playing the game with randoms you don't know, because having friends is helpful in many ways for example doing missions in lobbies, doing heists where you should all be in communication and being able to plan your moves and what not.

[b] Story mode [/b]
This will be my review about how how it has affected me and now how the story is, In the PS3 when it was fresh and new I had a lot of fun playing it and having a lot of fun working my way through the story and all of the heists. When I got to the PS4 I completed it again but never really touched it because its the same story. Finally moving on to PC I like story mode again because I am able to use mods and have fun in the game in ways that isn't possible on consoles at least not easily. If this is your first time playing GTA 5 and you haven't played the story before, I do recommend playing it because it is a good story to it.

[b] My final notes [/b]
if you are getting GTA 5 I would really recommend playing the game with friends online because just from my personal experience that is where I have had the most fun from the game. I love the game and I look forward to the future games in the series. I hope you all find this review helpful."

20302,"Good dumb fun. The story didn't really get to me, I mean, it is there. Is it anything special? Uuuugh, not really. The main gripe I have with it is the ending, shit, it didn't even feel like a final part of the game, there was essentially no build up. The cars at first felt strange, but that withered away rather quickly, the shooty stuff is fun, no surprises there. I don't know, the whole experience didn't feel as impactful as I had expected. Story missions treat you like a baby, the characters are all extreme, but that's the satire part I guess. I just wish the story was a bit more memorable and intense than it is. Still, the game's sandboxy nature provides for some quality fun carnage. Won't cover the online part, because I couldn't care less for GTA Online."
20303,"||| Why did I move here? I guess it was the weather. |||
The Grand Theft Auto that's been here for almost 9 years already. Still a great game to this day. It gave us some memorable quotes and more fun than expected. The story mode is perfect. 
GTA Online is a different story. You can enjoy it only when playing alone or with friends on a solo public session. Modders ruin your experience and it's thanks to Rockstar's garbage security. Fix your damn game, Rockstar.
Online has more downsides, but I don't think that I have to list them here. Everyone who has played the game knows what's wrong with it. Too bad that the OG's from Rockstar have left the company. We've got some good DLC's for the game at least.
Anyways, it's a solid experience. It's NOT JUST a game. It's a story filled with emotions. 10 out of 10, no questions asked.
And remember - Michael was never in witness protection."

I have met a fair share of griefers and hackers, but from my experience, most of the community is very nice and helpful. Story mode is also a big plus with this game. Definitely try it out. :)"

20417,"lets be clear, the 100 hours i've spent on this game is mainly in the online component so this review is based on the online not the single player ,however, if i was to review single player id likely give it a glowing review because of how fun it was.now! onto online ,as i said the online component is what i'm focusing on and i have played it extensively both on pc and ps4 so i have a pretty good knowledge of how this game is literally broken
1.the economy, unless you buy one of many ""shark cards""(which cost real money) for the first 50 hours your gonna struggle to gain any actual amount (word of advice, stay the hell away from apartments and doomsday heist they suck more then a vacuum) the tldp of the first 50 hours is -play simion car mission-get reward-play until you get million-realise that simion only pays you 15k per mission-do simple maths-realise that you'll have to do simion mission over 66 times-cry-eventually get million-buy ceo-realise you have to do more simion because cargo warehouse doesnt come with ceo-cry again 
2. ai in this game are far more artificial then intelligent and for the most part you'll be shouting profanities and other such insults, at them particularly when your driving, they have an amazing habit of switching lanes to hit into your car and slow you way down. As well as these idiot car ai we have retarded shooting ai with aimbot no less. In short gtao has some terrible ai but whats worse then that is your companions 
3. companions, one word ""lester"" another word ""agent 14"" one more word ""pavel"" just one more ""page"" also""assistant"" if i had all day id go on a frenzy just explaining the problems of all these characters ,however, ill keep it brief and just talk about lester the crest ,i personally realistically probably definitely wholeheartedly hate lester, he is annoying,he is not a good character ie he literally has no plot except for wanting to bang this asian one,and finally oh my god he is so unfunny.Its telling when almost every character in your game tells the same jokes over and over and over again you'd think that rockstar might change it it up but no, the jokes in this game mainly go like this ""now its time to rob a bank,lets hope you don't die or anything hahah"" that is literally the extent of lesters lines and also represents every other ""funny"" line you'll hear in the game 
4,what they got right, now i could go into vehicles and mention the absolutely brain dead decision that was the oppressor mk2,however, thats too low even for me so i'll tell you now what the online got right 1.the heists are usually fun and entertaining with good gameplay tossed in there and kinda good rewards 2.leveling up isn't the worst thing ever and generally isn't that grindy 3.the gun play is always good not amazing or in depth but it gets the jobs done 4.i guess i like how you can personalise your character fairly well.

and with that iv'e only discussed about half the problems and all this is coming from the top of my head so do take it with a grain of salt i personally like this game however the online really drags it down and gives it a bad name however i will recommend it to anyone just for the storymode"

20431,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

20443,"I personally believe Grand Theft Auto 5 currently holds 1st place in the open-world game genre. It offers a variety of different styles of play depending on your preferences. Whether you want to play a few missions or go on a complete rampage with the cops or pedestrians it is incredibly fun to enjoy the world of GTA 5. Even just driving around in the city of Los Santos or visiting the casino you always have something to do and I can guarantee that running out of options is not a possibility. Long story short I really enjoy playing this game and I absolutely recommend it to everybody who has not tried it yet.

20521,"If you are playing this for your first time, it's great. Now that I've been playing it for 4 years, it kinda gets rid of the ""new"" experience. I've already done basically all there is to do in this game. It's still a fun game to play with friends and screw around in but repeating the same jobs and heists over and over again for money isn't very fun anymore. Furthermore, all the new cars and oppressors and laser tanks and stuff are very annoying. Not to mention all the modders in this game. It's hard not to load into a public lobby and have no modders. Overall, it's still a great game and will be for a long time. (If you're wondering why I only have 8 hours on this game, it's because I played this game on Xbox since like 2015)"

20553,"I think, Grand Theft Auto V is already a [b]timeless[/b] game. Despite almost 10 years in the market and it still [b]impresses[/b] with its [b]graphics, great driving model, frequent updates[/b] and many more. I've spent over 1000h in the game and there's still something to do!

[b]About storymode[/b]
I completed the whole story (every story missions, side missions and side activities) in around 60h. An interesting fact is, GTA V allows you to play as 3 characters during one play through: as a young gangster [b]Franklin[/b], retired thief Michael and psychopathic Trevor. An amazing combination that lets you play various missions and side activities aspecially designed for the character. The story has wacky humor and engaging with a dramatic or very satisfying ending. In addition, there are many side activities that allow you to get even more involved in the gangster world. [b]I highly recommend this game![/b]

[b]About Online[/b]
Almost 95% of the game time I spent in Online mode of the GTA V - [b]GTA Online[/b]. GTA Online allows you to play with your friends. There are [b]countless[/b] activities you can play solo or in co-op as well as many different types of vehicles (such as helicopters, boats, cars, motorcycles etc.) which, combined with the excellent arcade driving model, creates an interesting alternative to other racing games (such as NFSs or Grid). By regular updates this game tries to keep your attention and engagement at the highest level possible."

20612,"So much fun you can do whatever you want and its like real life kinda
"
20613,"This is a rewiev of GTA ONLINE, not GTA 5.
I am constantly insulted when playing this game. The fact that it has been out there for so long, and they still havn't done shit to fix bugs or get working anticheat makes me want to bang my head against the wall. The game is also very grindy, if you want to try the different businesses and heists, it will take hundreds of hours (without bying sharkcards from R*, or get money from modders, risking getting banned). The community dosn't make this better either, constantly griefing you and/or talking shit to you, which can completely halt progress, or even send you hours back. The only reason i play this game, is because there are many features to explore, and because i want to do so with my friends. I don't recommend bying before R* fixes the overwelming amount of dissconnection issues, loading times and bugs."

20628,Probably the best  all round game ever made...
20629,"the game is fun at times but the controls are really outrageous for real, and I think literally anyone can approve, it seems they were literally based on how the game was controlled by a controller.

i'd also think R* needs to work for a better anti-cheat on GTA Online, because i cannot take it anymore with all these modders"
20630,It's nice
20631,y
20632,super cool
20633,good game bro
20634,"This game has turned into a joke after all these years. really shows what a company can do after they make all their money then put very little to no effort in their game. the games controlled by modders, so they can do whatever the fuck they want with you (cant even report them btw cause rockstar doesn't give a shit) flying futuristic bikes with homing missles. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!. whoever thought that was a good idea should be fired right away. Very little payout for missions. heavily leans twords buying sharkcards. games overall very shit and dissapointed in what this game has become. i recomend no ones plays this game until the next game in the series cause clearly they just gave up. FUCK YOU ROCKSTAR"

20663,"So the setting of GTA V is hugely impressive, miles and miles and miles of city, beautiful countryside, amazing shorelines, loads of vehicles to play with. However...it's empty. It's just driving around and around and around - there are barely any missions available at any one time, you can't really interact with people unless it's in a strip club (which is just plain creepy and weird). Compare this with Skyrim, where you're picking up missions left right and centre, you can speak to everyone, there's always something to do, your mission marker is very clearly defined. Also, all 3 main characters are thoroughly unlikable, a******s - so even though the world is truly amazing and impressive...it's just not a world I want to spend any time in."

20674,Constantly have to restart the game when it puts me into infinite loading screens. Not great optimization on their part for a game that's made an insane amount of money. Why have I bought this game 5 times lmao
20675,"Great game, if you are not constantly ""entertained"" by modders (AKA cheaters) would love to blow you up a zillion times, or place a camp fire on your character :)

Though sometimes some cheaters can be nice, like providing you with a test vehicle similar to a flying chair (Oppressor)

Though there are the ""Why you kill me"" players, who get so upset, 'cus GTA advised me to go destroy the shipment of their cargo that the ""Why you kill me"" players, was transporting, to get more cash.

The ""Why you kill me"" players, has a hard time with 2+2, she never gets the right answer. Not realising that GTA is a gangster game. I mean the game is filled with peace loving weapons.

Also if you would  like to text chat other players, you will have to learn at the minimum, Russian or Chinese :)
For some strange reason I am unable to figure how, is why the Chinese speak so much via chat in the game. There is just a wall of Chineeesseeeeeeesssssssssss text on right side of screen.

Anyways, buy the game and come have fun :)"

It is optimised which was an issue GTA 4 had, the game has good graphics and the story is good. This game has alot of content and is very big. The online mode is also fun with friends.

20751,"Honestly this game is really fun from the aspect of doing whatever you want whenever you want. But the only way the game is fun is if you have you guessed it MONEY! YES that is the only way to get all the cool s***, but Rockstar wants you to buy the shark cards for money instead. It's also a pain to get started for a second time and the community, well it's really toxic. I don't think you should waste your time with GTA online because thats what I played for my entire 143 hours and I wish I got my life back. If your just going for the story then go for it."

20770,best game ever everyone has to play it
20771,nice game
20772,I can't believe it but this actually happened to my buddy Grapos Silver.
20773,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
20774,ye
20775,"yes
"
20776,i love getting killed by a little kid on a flying bike that has homing missiles
20777,yeah!
20778,e
20779,"This game, probably known by most people already, had a lot to offer. The single-player mode is not bad at all and the online version is even better.  Sure there is a lot of violence (if you so chose to) but there is actually a lot of other things you can do apart from that.  Missions, tasks, free-roaming and didnI mention the unnecessary violent actions that... Well.. it *is* fun and could give you a great case of the giggles.

You will get the most out of the game in multiplayer mode with IRL friends because trying to get unrelated people to join in is hard and many times there are a lot of pre-teens with foul mouths just messing about and trying to ruin the experience.

Glitches!? Of course! The game is bug-ridden, but most of them are known and a part of the experience.

Game physics?  Well..  it is not *realistic* but had it been so you would have been dead in seconds and where is the fun in that?

Would I recommend it to others?
Sure thing!  If you have someone to play it with definitely. If you don't have anyone close to play with then maybe try out Big Red Redemption III instead."

20911,"I have been playing without committing any crimes in 1st person perspective.  I haven't used any of the criminal enterprise starter stuff, I have only accepted freebies when they are part of the current update's free stuff, and I drank my bonus Million dollars at the casino so I would start with $0, the casino gave me a free 1000 chips, I spent 500 to gain access to the wheel and rolled a $40,000 cash roll. With that I then hired cabs to take me treasure hunting, I grabbed some collectibles as well, rapidly reaching high enough of a rank to be able to go to flight school, doing that has earned me over $1M I have a decent property with a 6 car garage and Heist room I'll never use, and I'm only $1m away from being able to open a legit business.  8 hours for $1M and a $245K property is not too shabby at all, then I bought a bicycle, and took advantage of the free Armored Kuruma they are giving away this week, hopped on my bicycle and rode it to the casino to spin the wheel again for another $50K in cash.  I haven't fired a single shot and no one has died as a consequence of my actions.  The taxi driver did get into a few fender benders though.

As for single player, well, I haven't played that any further than necessary to get to the online portion.  I have played over 1,000 hours on my other account, and I've enjoyed nearly every minute, and the story was engrossing and the characters were loads of fun to play.  So in my opinion this game has not only aged well, but is fun enough that I created a whole new steam account and bought it again just so I could try playing it as a legitimate citizen of Los Santos who avoids crime, but who will still punch out a MF who tries to start somethin."

20923,"GTA5 is a great sandbox game!  I've been playing the game for years now and there is just so much stuff to do, that I actually enjoyed doing. The story mode is great as well. Starts you off robbing a bank. I feel like that just shows through the game and fun stuff that you can't really do to much of in real life. Then as the Story Mode progresses, you unlock 2 more characters and do more illegal things and mission/heist! After you Finnish one mission or heist, you can literally do anything you want in real life in a game and not go to jail for it. SUPER FUN!  There is also an Online Mode. GTA5 Online is also SUPER FUN! There are so many different ways you make money, illegally, and once you have all the money in the world, you can buy sick houses, penthouses in casinos, apartments, super cars, planes, boats, ect. Anything you can think of, you can buy. And also, don't forget the best part about GTA5, both Online and Story Mode,     THE STRIP CLUB!!!
Amazing!
On a real note though, I would definitely recommend this game to anybody that is interested into buying it! Again, AMAZING, GREAT, CREATIVE, game. Definitely the best sandbox game every, and up there with the best games in history. 
Hope you buy this game, and if so, enjoy!!!

Even with the Online having vastly more content, its hard to even use the content due to every other player in your server is extremely hostile. Also getting into a Heist (best way to make in game currency) takes anywhere from 10 minutes to a half hour, then you have greifers that will go through the hour long heist and fail it intentionally at the end just to waste your time. It happens often. Online is toxic even more so than most games. I still recommend but only if you have bad internet that allows you to solo lobby in a public server."

21114,"Coming from someone who has been playing this game for a solid 5 years now, even tho the game is a bit graphic I do suggest the game because its a game that you can have fun with friends as well as have fun by yourself. With the option to play online and a story mode it has hours of fun built inside of it."

21124,other than the bad godmode hackers this game is super fun and enjoyable. the good modders are super dope and often friendly  enough to help fight off the bad ones for you. Pro tip by the sub before you buy anything else super expensive it'll pay itself off in the long run.
21125,"i have a lot of mix feelings about GTA but I guess the best way I can state the game is In my opinion, GTA 5 is a timeless classic. I would say timeless, however, since it's been eight years with no new entry in the series, this game is getting quite stale. If you've never played, it's still a fun game especially with friends. And the campaign is one of the best I've played. I would recommend, but please for the love of God Rockstar, make a GTA 6"

21151,"Plagued with hackers online!

I just had a hacker chase me from lobby to lobby, crashing my game every time he loaded into the new lobby I joined. He was able to change his name on the fly and so once he noticed him joining my server over and over again I would leave before he could fully load in. This led him to change his name and clan tag, then spawning inside my house before i knew it was him again and crash my game. 

What a time to be alive.....

Do not pay for any of Rockstars games/DLC, you will be throwing your money away!"

21176,"A hacker somehow made it so my game can no longer connect to online. 

Almost every online lobby I've joined had a hacker and due to this even some of my friends I was playing with at the time got banned. I do have to say the customer support I initially got to help iron out some Social Club issues I had was very helpful and quite pleasant. But it seems I'd have to see customer support for this game to run adequately at all if I get thrown in a lobby with a hacker, which at this point seems a given. This makes it sad due to the fact I only got this game to play with friends and don't really care for the single player aspect of this game."

21257,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

21391,"1. There are game-breaking bugs that prevent you from completing objectives that have existed for over 2 years and haven't been fixed: despite many DLC's being released: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5wLw2LRTUE
2. The game is called ""grand theft auto"" but actually only bad vehicles can be stolen, good vehicles you literally have to do long tedious jobs and buy insurance for, which is obviously not ""grand theft"", it is a job
3. The online version of the game rewards people for killing you under many circumstances (mostly the jobs you are trying to make money on), and while you start with nothing, other players have flying motorcycles that shoot homing missiles and actual tanks with rocket launchers mounted on the top, while wearing alien outfits and holding laser beams and ray guns

The list goes on but you get the idea, play something else"

Online is good, but they keep removing fun jobs and the famous griefers and hackers ruin the experience. Time for GTA 6 Rockstar, take your time, but don't mess up like GTA Trilogy. ;)"

21495,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

The spectrum of communities within the GTA playerbase is extraordinary from PVP and RNG to car lovers and grinders, at the end of the day, it's a game where you can do as you like, just have fun. 

You can see that I haven't played it all too much, that's because my main account is on XBOX, regardless, my point still stands - It's one of, if not, my favourite and probably my most important game to date."

21647,"It could even be a good game, if it was not for the devs' complete negligence. No game I have ever paid for has this much cheaters, really... and this is supposed to be an AAA game. Well, even the ancient MTA/SAMP servers do way better job at keeping their servers clean.

I must add that I also had this game on PS4 long ago and it was really fine. PC version however is in a very sad state and the truth is that: it was never good and it only got worse over ages. Idk maybe the idea that PC version essentially makes players host the session in a P2P manner instead of real, dedicated and secure servers is not such a bright one after all. I am sure you(R*) can save some money on the servers, but this is at the cost of the game. 

I get that PC will always have more cheaters than consoles, but what is game presents us in its multiplayer mode is way past the tolerable point. No game will be like that unless the devs just do not care. It could be greatly improved if R* was willing sacrifice some revenue on proper servers and also take a more a more aggressive approach to gain back the control over their game. 

I can only hope that GTA 6 will employ way way way more strict anti-cheat mechanics at any cost, along with a more sensible hosting solution for PC, because GTA 5 sucks really hard when you set foot in its offical multi sololy because of the sheer number of cheaters..."

21701,"In short:

GTA Online's public lobbies are no reason to buy the game, they're boring, full of griefers or cheaters and in general just very anti-social. If you do plan on buying the game for GTA Online please try to get some friends to play it with you in private lobbies to do heists etc. Many of the newer CEO missions, Heist preparations etc. need to be done in public lobbies but there are workarounds to getting a lobby without any randoms.

For the GTA V (Story) part on the other hand, this game is a must-buy if you like Singleplayer story mode games! I've played through the story about 6 times by now on Playstation and on PC and I loved it everytime it just never gets boring to see the great development of Franklin, Michael and Trevor with each turn and twist of the story. There is no mission that i would deem as absolute lackluster or in any way boring, some are better others are not as good but they all have their charme.

This game is a masterpiece and a must-buy for every person that has ever played video games in my opinion."

You're on <insert console name> and are playing the same old game
Your friends are playing a new game they started playing again
They tell you to buy it
You spend ages begging your parents for money, but you've already bought something this week
They won't let you buy it for a few months
You finally buy it and hop on with your friends
You make some of the best memories with your friend group
Most of you switch to pc
You spend ages saving up for one and have finally bought one
You have all gotten so much in the game after hundreds of heists
You have reached rank 600 and have 900mil overall income
You just bought a really fun vehicle after a heist
You and your friends are having a lot of fun messing around with it
You are creating more memories, even better than on <insert console name>
It's getting late, all of you head offline to sleep, there's school tomorrow, isn't there?
School was really boring that day
You finally get home after the most boring and long day
You take a minute to remember how much you've worked to get everything you've got
You feel so much pride you've done this all legitimately
You're feeling so much more accomplished that you didn't use mods to reach your goals
You fire up your pc after your friends have gotten online
You open up steam
You open GTA
The rockstar launcher is taking ages to load
You restart it
You, and multiple friends have been banned from GTA Online
All of you put thousands of hours into the game
You pick up your PC and fling it out the window
You contact R* Support and they more or less tell you to deal with it
You find a new game with better devs

Story so far for me has been pretty engaging. Main missions are fun and get emotional at times. Side missions and stories are ridiculous but very fun. There's this one side mission where you film some people doing (something) in their backyard, and then get seen, then continue filming them - while driving away. Then later on you're fighting aliens and clowns that regenerate. You can even pick up random strangers, and drop them off at a cult (which I sadly did not do when I had the chance...)

But there's a LOT of violence everywhere, so this won't be for everyone. If you can ignore the amount of over-the-top violence and needless gore, this can be a somewhat cinematic experience. This is about single player.

Multiplayer also has some nice story missions (a lot more have been added over time), but it costs a lot of in-game money (can be earned as you play, although may take a while, or you can just buy shark cards - buy in-game money directly using real currencies). The other problem with multiplayer is finding people to play with, as a lot of story missions require having 1-3 partners in crime (both literally and figuratively). If you have a 4 player team, online can be a lot of fun!"

21954,"I am a 35 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 29 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

21977,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

The single player works great, but as someone who has played since launch, on multiple platforms, I can no longer recommend the PC version.  It's a shame, I don't know why the performance is so bad, I have had the same hardware for a while now, but the performance of GTA online has got steadily worse and worse until now it is basically unplayable.  I still maintain a constant 60fps offline, but online struggles to even break 10fps.  I can't be bothered anymore.  It's over."

I can't even re install rockstar launcher on the website because it also says that there is a newer version installed in which my computer doesn't even recognize basically i wasted my money on this game and can't even play the story mode that i liked most about the game.
22242,"Ever since I tried GTA online for the first time I have caused irreversible damage to my financial health. I am now incredibly in debt so much so that I had to change my identity and move to a different country. As I am writing this review, I am being hunted down by the US federal government. Anyways, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone. Just make sure that before you play online, you have a card linked to your steam account that is not yours unless you have at least an eight digit balance on your debit."

22268,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

Words cannot describe the pure serotonin and dopamine that I gain from playing this game. The grind is still one of the most satisfying things I have ever experienced. The storymode is one of, if not the best story that I have had the pleasure of playing through. Although I have had my rough patches with this game, whether it being my gripes with the company, or a current update, I always find myself coming back to play. The stories are funny and interesting, the online play is satisfying and content rich, the only major gripe that I have with the game are the cheaters/modders (if you were a majority console player like me). Hopping into a random GTA lobby and having fun and bantering with randoms have given me some of the funnest nights of my life. This game has helped me nurture a bond with my friends that has only grown stronger since our widespread escapades have ceased. I just really wanted to write this review to say thank you to Rockstar, and even if we haven't agreed much in recent years when it comes to RD2 and that horrible remastered collection, I still can't help but getting hyped for GTA6. I'm hoping that GTA6 will be the sequel that this masterpiece deserves, and not some shitty cash grab that so many AAA games are nowadays. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. If you are looking to purchase this game, GET IT. Especially if you have a group of friends to play with. I promise you it will be one of the most fun experiences you will have with your friends. And if you don't have any? Thats completely fine too! The PC community is actually very non-toxic when compared to the console player base I have most of my playtime with. Especially because of all-chat. I just feel that the only improvement that could be made is to enforce banning cheaters much more, as I feel that the major issue with the PC community is that every other lobby you load into, there is a cheater in god mode, that fucks with you just trying to play the game legit. Super unsatisfying setting up a heist, and having someone teleport to you, kill you, and steal/blow-up the goods, for no other reason then to bait a reaction in chat. Look, I have no problem with people enjoying the game how they want to, but when it becomes destructive, it makes the game overall less fun to play for others, and it very detrimental to the game. Overall, the game itself is a 9.5/10, but I do feel like the community does detract from free mode play a bit."

22517,"its ok 
"
22518,"GTA 5 is absolutely garbage IMO.  You would figure this game would be so much better considering it has been out for 10 years.  Nope! Loading into heists and you almost finish then the game freezes.  You can pretty waste your entire day going back and forth loading up heists, and have the same result.  My system is not at fault either, running an Alienware M15 Ryzen Edition with an RTX 3070.  I have the latest hardware and it's connected to the LAN network with high speed 1GB downloads.  Still, the game is absolute trash and I know why I left this game 5 years ago.  Not only that, but you have your modder/hackers continually goofing off and killing you when you're not even close to them.  Not a good experience."

However rockstar decided to suspend and reset my account and refuses to give me a reason for doing so, (all bans/suspensions are final, cannot be appealed and no details will be given). Given this can apparently happen at anytime and for no apparent reason (I have not violated their terms of service etc.) it kind of killed any desire to play the game and thus I cannot recommend it."

22605,"It's an irritating pile of crap, really. 

I last played a GTA game when the original was still groundbreaking and cool. As far as I'm concerned, it still is. I never thought taking them 3D would be a good move so I avoided them until now, but having an idle afternoon and a bit of spare cash, I bought it recently on offer. I did this, having noted (and in spite of) the comments about bad online experiences, on the basis that I expected only to play the single player story mode. This review doesn't therefore, concern GTA Online.

What I can say, is that the story mode is awful. Loading times (which are embarrassingly slow) aside, I just can't see how anyone could possibly enjoy it. Your time is mostly spent being whined at, patronised and generally annoyed by a cast of NPCs whose only role is apparently to order you around and swear a lot. Being an middle-class white male, I suspect that my failure to appreciate the first few hours of the game is entirely cultural.

Added to that, there just doesn't seem to be any point to doing anything. At the start of the game, you have no money, but really no way to earn any either. You're presented with an ""open world"" - but it's a total nonsense, because the only way to make money in any significant quantity is to do the missions, making it a very linear experience. All of the things which you could _choose_ to do in the original game (and with which it would be possible to build up a modest pot of cash / arsenal / etc.) have been removed.

For example, you can't sell cars you've stolen, rendering the description ""grand theft auto"" somewhat suspect. For any other misdemeanour you might consider committing, the police simply shoot you - but that's fine, because getting arrested is far more annoying and costly than getting wasted paying the hospital bill. The stock market, meanwhile, doesn't seem to function at all, and when it does, only goes one way, as soon as you invest in anything - and you're given only 5 days worth of past prices to make a judgement about whether to invest in the first place.

The only way to delay, but not avoid this terrible gameplay loop is to steal $11 from some unsuspecting pedestrian, followed by a 3 mile excursion, to find the nearest bridge to hide under, to escape the clutches of the law. Do that a few times in a play session and one might start to think of GTA V as a somewhat over-hyped running simulator.

Of course, one can try holding up grocery shops and so on to improve returns - I got over $100 once - but that merely introduces another 3-mile run to find one in the first place, before you even get to the point of committing your outrageous crime.

Disappointing would be an improvement. Avoid."

22633,"The best Czech food.-Pork dumpling zelo

Pork dumpling zelo is one of the most popular dishes of the Czechs - we would not even be afraid to call it almost a national dish. Roast pork, delicious cabbage and fluffy dumplings can make the day more pleasant, especially if a glass of well-chilled beer is served with them. How to master this basic recipe?

What we will need for the liver:

1 kilogram of pork neck in total
100 grams of lard, preferably pork
5 tricks of garlic
2 medium onions
1 tablespoon plain flour
2 teaspoons ground cumin
salt and pepper.

Procedure: Preheat the oven to 140 ¬∞ C. Salt the meat, pepper it and rub garlic thoroughly into it from all sides. Cut the onion into cubes and pour it into the baking dish. Put the meat on this onion bedding and add lard. Pour about 200 ml of hot water and bake. Bake the meat for about 3 hours. After removing it from the oven, let it rest in the baking tray for 15 to 20 minutes so that the juice is evenly distributed in it. Then we take the meat out of the roasting pan and cut it into slices, in the form of which we will serve it. Make the sauce from the onion baked with meat juice - transfer the contents of the baking dish to a pot, dust with flour and mix well. Pour another 200 ml of cold water over the mixture and cook on low heat and stirring for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

What we will need for cabbage:

1 bag of sauerkraut (who does not like sauerkraut, can use freshly sauerkraut, but it is good to salt before cooking in a bowl and let it rest for about an hour - it drains the juice and softens)
100 grams of bacon in total
2 medium onions
2 tablespoons lard
2 tablespoons plain flour
2 teaspoons ground cumin
salt
sugar
2 - 3 tablespoons vinegar

Procedure: Heat the lard in a pan. Add diced bacon, onion and cumin. Fry for a while, then add the cabbage. Pour it with either brine from the bag or the juice that the cabbage released, and let it cook for about 15 minutes. Add vinegar, salt and sugar to the cabbage according to how we like it. Attention! If we use fresh, salted cabbage, with additional salting carefully! After 15 minutes, dust the cabbage with flour and cook for another 15 minutes.

What we will need for dumplings:

1 kilogram of coarse flour
500 milliliters of lukewarm semi-skimmed milk
20 grams of fresh yeast
1 egg
1 croissant
salt
pinch of sugar

Procedure: In a larger bowl, mix the sifted flour with sugar and salt. We knock eggs into it, crush the yeast and add milk. Let it rest for 5 minutes. Then we make a compact dough with our hands. Next, add a croissant cut into small cubes and let it rise in the cloth-covered bowl for an hour. We then shape the cones from the dough, which we cook in a salted water bath for 18 minutes. Attention! We have to turn them around halfway through. After removing the dumplings from the bath, we pierce them in several places with a fork so that steam leaves them. Then we cut them into slices.

Done? Now all you have to do is place the dumplings, a portion of cabbage, cover everything with slices of delicious meat and pour the sauce over the plate. Enjoy your meal!

22672,"ita good game 
"
22673,"personal experience thus far: 
I played through the campaign in a couple of days and got the good ending, the game was very very fun. I enjoyed it a lot. 

However, as soon as I went online, i was killed hundreds of times by wannabe hackers with kiddiescripts. There were some more significant threats, someone tried to fucking change my background on my PC a while back, luckily, rockstar shut my game down before that happened. Yeah, online in this game sucks dick, download 5M and thank rockstar for having the will to at least protect their players from the problems they avoid solving."
22674,"Grand Theft Auto 5 is a thrilling andrenaline pumping game you can go into insane hiests or pull off the biggest KOS streak ever.
Points:
Map~   The map is very big for a exciting online adventure.
Cars/vehicles~   There is over 300 vehicles of different brands, ranging from Hypercars to cold war Fighter crafts and soviet bombers like the Tu-160 Blackjack.
Players~   Players/friends are fun to play with you can also betray their trust and blow them or their cars up.

Problems~  1/15 of the player base is cheaters using 'mods' to exploit the game and ruin ur fun experience playing Rockstars hit game.

I personaly love playing this game with ym friends and exploring the landscape, like with almost every other game Rockstar has made it has emersive whats-coming next Lore and Perfect story and quests

"
22718,"single player is ok but online is riddled with modders and and griefers and it never seems like the game ever really gets better the in game prices only go up and the rewards for missions only goes down to allow Rockstars garbage policy of focusing in on shark cards. the price of one weapon in the game is like $40000 to buy and even using ammo cost so much the only way to earn anything back is in missions of which themselves make only around 30k at what feels like max. and the high levels to make the most money costs up to 2 mill simply to enjoy the better missions and make slightly more money just makes the game a constant grind and it is no wonder modders have a paradise in this game as they can cheat all they want untill they mess with Rockstars transaction system that cant tell the difference between a exploit and a mod, yet only knows that if you are making a profit in the missions then you must be a hacker, i have had multiple accounts banned or timed out simply being with a modder in a lobby of which you must be in to be able to unlock all content in the game. I can understand why modders do what they do with such a broken grind system. at the rate casual players go in gta online   they probably spend about 300k in one day yet gain only 305k when  they are on.  i dare you to jump into 15 public lobbies for half a hour and not run into a modder or a griefer, its nearly imposible. Make the ingame currency easier and more profitible to make.  and reduce the cost of all actions in game by like half and i will say this game is a great game and can recommend. but untill then F rockstar and release GTA 6 already."

22743,"[h1]Review For Story Mode Only:[/h1]

Story: 6/10 The story comprises of the three main characters Michael, Trevor, and Franklin. All three go on heists and do jobs for other people such as the FBI. The story is nothing crazy. Michael has family problems and is one of the main plots of the story, I don't blame him though, his family is complete shit to him. Franklin is from the hood and wants to make it big by learning from Michael & Franklin. Trevor's goes to find Michael after learning that his best friend is actually still alive. 

Game play: 6/10 Whilst there are a lot of activities you can do in this game, most of the content is very frustrating. Without the cheats and option to skip missions I'm not sure I would have completed the story as fast as I did. Helicopters control like doo doo. Cars will also spin out way too easily. The cops in this game are relentless and the conditions for some of these missions will fail you very easily. The pedestrians will always get in your way. These npcs are so stupid that it makes the game feel less alive than a non open world game like Yakuza. I will give it props though, the shooting, heists, and assignations in this game are really fun.

Music: 4/10 The music in this game is just.... what can I say. There are rarely any good songs that pop up on the radio and I really hate how the radio turns on every single time I drive a car.

Graphics: 8/10 For a 2013 game, the graphics still hold up quite well, although I was definitely more impressed with the graphics when it first launched but now graphics like these are standard.

Price: Get it when on sale. This game is often on sale for cheaper never pay more than 15 dollars I'd say.

Overall score: 7/10"
22744,shoe store is fire
22745,car boom very funny
22746,All I can say is Love this game ever since release
22747,After trying over and over to find a lobby that didn't contain a hacker/moder of some sort making it damn near impossible to do any missions or get anything done. I would NOT wast the money paying for this game any more unless you are STRICTLY playing offline or you yourself know how to hack or mod or protect yourself from those who do so and ruin the fun for the few of us who dont get to sit there and play 24/7.

Some people say like ""ughhh, there are so many cheaters in there!"" but ya know what? After playing online for like 80 hrs i only saw like one or two guys doing something weird. There is always a small update once a week, so you wont get bored. And if you have friends (unlike me) you can do heists and other fun in-game activities together! Buy the game, make your friends buy it as well and have fun!"

Very frustrating, but I enjoyed getting high while watching tv, listening to music, and taking a shower in my apartment. I also enjoy driving. I wish the controls were easier, but that's mostly on me, for not having a proper mouse and just using the touch pad on my laptop. Anyways, I get very invested in video games when I first download them. It has been fun, I just wish I could open it and play again"

22932,"*Review for GTA 5 Online*
Received this from a friend April 8, 2022, when it was on sale for $15. Its fun playing with friends half the time is about the only good thing that can be said. I haven't been on in over a week, and received an email notice today for a 30 day suspension, this includes a full wipe of your online character. Rockstar gives no reason on their decision, According to their own website:

 ""GTA Online suspensions are triggered by a number of factors, including modding in GTA Online, exploiting or abusing game mechanics, manipulating protected game data and code, or interfering with other players‚Äô gameplay experience.""
""All GTA Online suspension and banning decisions are final and may not be appealed.""

Played the game to play the content of the game and I don't care for pvp unless I'm playing a real pvp game. I can easily say every server had hackers harassing people, giving away cash, cars, collectibles, randomly killing the entire server of players or cherry picking them, shutting down servers. summoning the entire server to places to be mass murdered or to harass players. Hacking your profile so you have to go through a separate walk through on how to reset becoming a ceo/motorcycle club president again after a hacker nuked the ability to do so. Plenty of fond memories of being relentlessly harassed until changing servers or logging off. Rockstar does absolutely nothing to hackers and griefers.

I'm much closer to retirement age than drinking age. When a gaming company can arbitrarily suspend/ban an account and wipe any progress it sets a bad precedent. 

It would of been hilarious to have Rockstar manage World of Warcraft.  Buyer Beware

22967,"This review is for GTA V Online, not the singleplayer GTA V. GTA V's singleplayer is great for what it is but most people buying this game in 2022 will be purchasing it for the online experience. 

  GTA V Online has such an amazing groundwork. A beautiful map, tons of content, and a plethora of things to do. 

  All of the above features are thrown out the window by the amount of modders and cheaters in the game. While many people would argue that there aren't that many of them or that they don't affect the experience, both of these statements are just untrue. From my experience, almost every public lobby has at least 1-2 modders in it. These ""modders"" and the amount they can do outside the game's boundaries is absolutely unacceptable. 

  They can spawn unobtainable vehicles, become invincible, fly, explode the entire map, teleport, become NPCs such as animals, lock you into a cage, crash your game instantly, and many other things. If this wasn't enough, they can violate your privacy. They can force you to type things into chat and even SEE YOUR IP ADDRESS. It's questionable if having a VPN will help this, though many have said that it definitely will, and I strongly advise using one if you do happen to be playing. 
  
  Your first thought would be to report these people to Rockstar, correct? Well. Modders get alerts when you send a report through the game, which allows them to delete them before they even reach Rockstar. That's right. You can't even report these cheaters which can be an actual threat to your game experience, your Rockstar account, and your real-world well being. 

  On top of all this, Rockstar as a company is just completely awful. They have taken most customer support down for the game, so most email reports will not work to get any cheaters banned even with video proof. However, they do have ban waves in which they ban accounts of suspected cheaters every month or so. Hilariously, my account was falsely banned for 30 days and my entire character reset. All of the 95.4 hours you see at the time of writing this review was erased for existing in a lobby with a modder, something out of my control and completely without my consent. I had never received a warning nor committed any offense on my GTA or Social Club account before this. 

This game is outdated, not supported by the developers, and swarming with cheaters that can put you at risk. 
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR THE ONLINE."
22968,"Great game, very fun, too many hackers, and modders to be playable. some servers have nice hackers, that kick the other hackers, but unless ur on that server, gta pc is broken. instead of good players and better players, its players with god mode vs a few players that dont. the funny part, is u ask anyone what to do about it, their response is, well get mods so you cant be killed. its like part of the culture at this point to mod the game and ruin it."

22971,9/10
22972,best game
22973,good game
22974,good
22975,Most fun game
22976,"No just no, One word only ""Modders"". There is no point in playing this game cause of modders there will always be one in game unless you are private. You cant report them cause they can just delete the report and then get your account reported and suspended. They will kill you over and over for no reason and always will have better stuff then you. So there is no point in playing, this game would be amazing if there was no hackers or cheaters or modders would've been the best game ive played in a while."
22977,its good
22978,this game is fun to play with friends

22981,"GTA V is an awesome game and it is great! I have been playing it since release in 2013 on the PS3 and later on PS4 and last year I made the switch to PC and have been playing the game quite a lot and I love it. The game it has been a great few years with it and it is constantly expanding and getting better most of the times, countless hours of fun with it and keeps me interested a lot though I will say that sometimes this game does feel a little dragged on when it comes to the Online but they are still trying which I do like, there are negatives with the online like how soon GTA+ will come to PC and that is a crappy IRL paywall and how it tries to convince you to buy sharkcards but if you pay for sharkcards you are literally ruining the entire point of the online but yeah this is really fun and if you haven't played it you definitely should"

22994,sehr gut!
22995,really fun i have 1000 hours in this game great game dont mod and dont find modders
22996,"obviously by now you know that the story mode is good in this game, but online is what some have mixed feelings about due to the shark cards and expensive items.  Personally, i find it still easy to make that money in game instead of buying shark cards.  Grinding in gta online can be fun, but not for everyone.  If youre not a materialistic person and need all the fancy new cars and planes, youll be just fine.  if you manage your businesses right youll have plenty of money to do what you want.  Racing in gta online is also very fun and one of my favorite things to do.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY SHARK CARDS, PLAY THE GAME AND YOU WILL MAKE MONEY"

23029,"Yeah this game was pretty alright. I think most people who play gta 5 play it for the online feature, which is a bit sad since the story mode is amazing. I wish rockstar would focus more on adding dlc for the story instead of the chaotic mess that online is. Other than that, gta 5 is in my top 10 favorite games list. I'd recommend this game to almost anyone. I honestly thought I wouldn't like gta games in general but I gave gta 5 a chance and that was a very great decision."

The message says that he will be unbanned in 30 days, but his everything he owns, including property and money will be reset so there is bascially no point in coming back. There is no appeal and the crazy thing is like everyone else that has been banned randomly, they don't hack, the hackers are still in the servers ruining peoples sesions, and rockstar just ignores them.

MGS V or bloodhunt.) but ""I"" im not every single person who inhabits this earth so yea check out the game if your interested (REMEMBER TO ALWAYS SCOUT A GAME USING YT, ESPECIALLY SHOOTERS AS THEY HAVE THE GREATEST CHANCE OF BEING WORTHLESS, #PROMOTE SCOUTING ON COD AND BF.)       i checked for free cause its a 40 (used to be 60.) dollar game that i bought for $15, that aint SHIT, that barely counts as physical matter."

YES there are plenty of players online that are going to grief you, but you can always change 'session' if it gets bad.  Or you can get better at it and mess them up before they mess you up.  It's NOT great for someone who wants to play an online version of GTA (when using online) because it's no longer just AI -- it's actual players who can be quite mean and follow you pretty much anywhere you go (you are visible on the map .. kind of think that should be a bit less ubiquitous.)  I still support this game both offline and on.  It's occasionally glitchy like most online action games, but less-so than most."

23222,"As much I love Gta v, this PC port isn't that great. No hate on GTA V! It's such an amazing game i recommend you to play, but on a pc. No, I more recommend getting it on a console instead. If you really want to enjoy the game without lag, you really need a high end pc to even enjoy the game with ultra graphics. Which in fact, I can run GTA V with ultra graphics. but overall, GTA V is such an amazing game, but not on PC. I do respect how the graphics are amazing, and pretty, but trying to play the game with them aren't really great. Yes, I guess you can Lower stuff in the settings, but it makes the game look kinda bad. if your really wanting to play the pc version, please make sure you have at least a high end pc to even run this game. if you're wanting to play on console, i recommend buying the next-gen version on ps5/xbox series x/s. Or hell! even the Xbox one/PS4 versions of the game, instead of this. But overall, GTA V is such an amazing game that I really recommend you to play."

23230,"Honestly, I don't know where to start.
On the surface It looks like there's a shit ton of stuff to do in this game. There's hundreds of individual missions, Like 10 heists, missions for your businesses, etc. The problem is you make shit money for ALMOST ALL OF THEM. Example, missions you get from the characters in from the campaign can give you somewhere around 20K, more or less depending. Seems like a good chunk of change, right? Not when you consider that car you want is 1.4 mil, or the business you want is 1.6 mil. Making money when you first start out is TERRIBLE. I played this game on and off over the years, but I really got into this time around and I forgot what the grind was like. When I downloaded it for the first time in about 2 1/2 years I was so excited to play because they had added so much content. But when I booted it up and started playing I Immediately was reminded of why I stopped in the first place. Everything feels so out of reach. There's tons of cool stuff to be had but unless you want to commit hundreds of hours to the game or buy shark cards good luck. Moving on to properties. Obviously the whole objective of online is to acquire properties and use them to make more money etc. The problem is almost every single business is 1.5 mil+ and on top of that they aren't immediately profitable. To start to make decent money you have to grind even more and piss more money into them to even break even. Example: When I got back into the game every told me the bunker was the way to go. As far as passive income was concerned this thing was regarded as the best. So I saved my money, sold a few of the cars I bought and did a shit ton of regular missions and crate warehouse missions. (Business where you collect random stuff and sell it in one big go) after a while of all of this I finally had enough to buy the cheapest bunker. This is where I realized exactly how bad the grind in this game is. So the bunker makes guns which you then do a sell mission to sell and make money. For the bunker to make guns you need supplies. There's two means to get supplies. Buy them flat out (to fill up on them is 75K) or to do a mission and go get them (which fill up 1/5 of the bar) The missions to get supplies are flat out fucking terrible. ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE PLAYING SOLO. The bunker isn't the only business with terrible missions also btw. And by terrible I mean you're playing by yourself, and you go to do a resupply mission because you're broke after buying the thing and can't afford supplies. The mission is shoot down a fucking helicopter that's halfway across the map, kill the 3 people that parachute out in all separate directions, then take the crates back 1 at a time because you can't carry multiple. Also I forgot to mention that this entire time the whole lobby of 30 people get a pop up that you are doing this and your visible on the map the entire time. Same goes for selling the final product as well. Have a million dollars worth of guns to sell? Good luck doing it solo considering the game gives you 3 vehicles you have to take to separate locations all while the exact location of said vehicles is shown on the map for the whole lobby to see. At this point you're probably thinking ""why not get some people to help you out?"" and that would make sense if there was literally and incentive for other people to do so but there isn't. The MC and CEO work has a shit ton of missions designed for multiple people to play but the only person who is remotely benefited by doing them is the person that owns the businesses. You'd think if you help your friend sell 1.2 million dollars worth of fucking guns you'd make something right? how does 5K sound? There's no incentive to help other people complete these missions as you make no money and your time would be better served doing your own. I want to play this game with my friends and have a good time but as someone who hasn't played for 5 fucking years and doesn't own a whole lot I can't, because I have to grind to get decent cars/equipment for the game to be fun. Finally we arrive to the heists. The idea of doing a heist with 4 of your buds sounds like a blast right? Break some asshole out of jail, rob a bank, etc. And on top of that make a large sum of money. What's not to love? For starters, the beginning heists (The ones you unlock via buying a high end apartment) are terrible. Each one has 4-5 setup missions where you basically acquire the means to complete the heist. Makes complete sense until you realize these missions are literally designed to waste your time. These setup missions take so long to complete depending on the specific one. On top of that while doing a heist the normal enemies you face are beefed up and have way better aim than usual. Better aim as in you'll be swerving in and out of traffic doing 100mph and the guy on the side of a helicopter can literally fucking beem you and hit every single shot. On top of this on normal difficulty you only get 1 extra team life. So if you are playing with someone who made the mistake of being new to the game they either sit in the back and do nothing the whole time or everyone gets punished. But it all must be worth it in the end right? That's the point of the a heist, it's meant to be challenging but have a big payout right? Welp, not according to rockstar. After around 40 mins to a hour of doing these setup missions you finally get to the heist. The objective is to go to a bank, rob it, and escape via motorcycle to a boat halfway across the map. Pretty straightforward. That is until you get the money and get out of said bank and immediately get beemed by the shit ton of cops outside. Which by the way, the whole concept of doing all this intricate prep work to get all this specific equipment just to stache your getaway vehicles 4 blocks away is pretty fucking stupid. Did I mention when you get shot money falls out of your bag and is taken out of the total cut? Or if you use all 1 of your team lives and have to restart from a checkpoint you don't get that money back? So you and your 3 buddies take all this time to do this heist, you get to the finale, and half of your total 1 mil (already being split between 4 people) is taken from you because you got shot a bunch at the end. Which unless you are a 800 pound incel that plays gta more than you breathe it's impossible not to. Weird enough the money magically stops falling out of your bag after you lose half of that mil. Did I also mention that the heist has a 100K setup cost for the person that hosts? oh, and don't forget the police and civilian  AI are literally programmed to run into while you are trying to escape on the shitty motorcycles you get. The worst part about it is that the newer the heist is, the better it gets. But rockstar can't take the time to go back and fix the old content because they are to busy bathing in the 6 BILLION DOLLARS they've made off the game to fix literally anything. There's literally 1 good way to make money in this game and that's the cayo heist. you can make around 1.4 mil a hour. Now why would I do anything else to make money except for this. Nothing else in the game gives you a payout like this. No business or heist. And you can do it solo. There's literally no balance. Rockstar developed all this shit no one uses anymore because 1 heist pays a shit ton more than anything else. Oh, I failed to mention that if you don't get a infinite loading screen while doing this stuff you'll have a modder in 99% of lobbies to blow you up and crash your game. Apparently 6 Billion isn't enough to develop some decent anti cheat. In the past two week I've had maybe 3 lobbies where there hasn't been a cheater. I didn't even touch on the greifers with stupid OP vehicles either. I know I talked specifics a lot in this review but this sums a majority of the content in regards to making money. If you insist on playing google how to ""quickly repeat""  the cayo heist."

23356,"[h1][u]Grand Theft Auto V is an unfairly misjudged and very misunderstood title.[/u][/h1]

When you think of Grand Theft Auto V, you probably think of a game that‚Äôs about nothing more than stealing cars, killing people and robbing banks. While it‚Äôs true that these are three major aspects of the game, there is so much more to GTA V, and as someone who has invested nearly 600 hours into the game, having played through the story mode three times, including obtaining 100% completion and unlocking countless achievements, as well as having spent a respectable chunk of that time in GTA Online, it pains me to see such a great game get lumped together with mindless shooters such as Call of Duty.

Grand Theft Auto V is a brilliant game, and is very rich in excellent story-telling, tremendous voice acting, and more self-aware humour and attention to detail than possibly any other video game out there. The game has three playable protagonists, the first of whom is Franklin Clinton, a 25-year old street gangster and repo man who tries to make a serious name for himself in the criminal world whilst living with his aunt in a ghetto neighbourhood a few doors down from his best friend Lamar, who frequently meddles in his business and always has a dozen hilarious zingers up his sleeve whenever the two are together. The second protagonist is Michael De Santa, a middle-aged typical Los Santos douchebag with narcissistic personality disorder. Michael has a plastic wife and two spoiled kids who hate him, and has been living in hiding under a different name for nine years after a deal with FIB Agent Dave Norton. The third protagonist is Trevor Philips, an oddly-lovable, unpredictable neurotic psychopath, who despite his intimidating and disturbing tendencies is as loyal as a golden retriever to those he cares about. Trevor lives in a trailer out in the boonies,and is involved in a number of gang wars, as well as a meth business. Trevor is usually seen with his boot-licking business partner Ron and his empty-headed ice cream-loving pal Wade. Following a crucial story event that I won‚Äôt spoil here, Michael (and later Trevor) take Franklin under their wing, marking Michael‚Äôs official return to crime after a decade-long hiatus. An unlikely friendship is formed, and the trio embark on an unforgettable crime spree. Let me touch a bit more on some of the game‚Äôs important characters. Franklin‚Äôs Aunt Denise is an outspoken feminist who is often parading around her neighbourhood yelling out triumphant chants with her lady friends. Michael‚Äôs wife Amanda is an ex-stripper turned trophy wife who birthed Michael‚Äôs two children: Jimmy and Tracey. Jimmy is an overweight free-loading loser who disrespects his father and sits in his room all day smoking weed and yelling obscenities at people online, and Tracey dreams of being a dancer and a singer, and is often hanging out with swinger groups and trying out for Reality TV. Simeon Yetarian, a sketchy Armenian sleazebag who owns an auto shop, is Franklin (and Lamar)‚Äôs employer at the start of the game. Lester Crest, an old associate of Michael and Trevor's, is a tech whiz who foresees all of their heists. Then there‚Äôs Devin Weston, a rich douchebag whose shoes are probably more expensive than Michael‚Äôs house. Devin gives the protagonists some of their jobs throughout the story, and notoriously holds out on their pay. Dave Norton is a corrupt FIB Agent who makes a deal with Michael at the beginning of the game. Later on, he and the absolute tool that is FIB Agent Steve Haines negotiate even more jobs for Michael, Trevor and Franklin. The group also have many enemies, such as Martin Madrazo, head of the Mexican drug cartel, Wei Cheng, the leader of a Chinese crime syndicate, and Stretch, a frenemy of Franklin‚Äôs who has led him into countless traps and expresses a strong dislike for him. There are several other supporting and minor characters throughout the game, but these are all of the majorly important ones. Now let‚Äôs talk about the game itself for a bit.

The story mode packs hundreds of hours of content for you to enjoy, with over seventy main story missions (including three different game endings), as well as a metric truck-ton of side missions. Additionally, the amount of possible ways to entertain yourself apart from missions is in the hundreds. GTA V is not just a crime simulator, but also a life simulator. Do you want to practice your shooting? Spend an afternoon at the gun range. Would you like to improve your flying skills? Go to flight school or try your hand at some of the trick flights. Looking for a relaxing way to spend your day after an intense heist? Grab a buddy and play a game of golf, tennis or darts. You can also visit the strip club, grab a drink at the bar, go to the movies (you actually get to see the movie), do yoga, go hunting for elk, or sit at home and watch television (with actual 10-minute long episodes of fictional TV Shows, as well as news channels). Still not enough for you? Take a drive while listening to one of the twenty-two available radio stations that offer great music of pretty much any genre, in addition to hours-worth of ridiculous advertisements, comments by the stations‚Äô respective hosts, and news segments that discuss events currently happening in your part of the game. You can also import your own music. As you drive (or sail along), be sure to look out for the countless collectibles in the game in order to earn some achievements and unlock more side quests. Between both the Story Mode and GTA Online, you can find Letter Scraps, UFO Parts, Nuclear Waste, Submarine Parts, Peyote Plants, Casino Cards, Action Figures, Treasure Clues, Bounty Hunting Missions, and possibly even more collectibles that I‚Äôm forgetting. You can also compete in races on both sea and land, participate in triathlons, go skydiving, visit the carnival and ride the ferris wheel or roller coaster, and put your driving (or flying) skills to the test with the respective Stunt Jumps and Under the Bridge/Knife Flights. Did I mention you can also change your look? If you're getting bored with the same hair style, facial hair or clothing, don't worry! Just pop any of the Barber Shops or Clothing Stores into your GPS and go on a shopping spree with your hard-earned money! You can also visit the AmmuNation Store and buy new guns, melee weapons, weapon attachments, parachutes, bombs and more. If this still isn‚Äôt enough for you, pull out your cell phone. There are also hours upon hours of entertainment to be found on GTA V‚Äôs fictional internet. You can browse the social media pages of every living character you come across in the game, online shop for cars, bikes, boats, businesses and more. There are also many videos to be watched, surveys to be taken, and easter eggs to be discovered. In addition to all of these incredible activities, GTA Online offers even more things to do that are exclusive to the Online portion of the game, one of the more notable ones is the activities in the Diamond Casino, such as horse betting, table games, spinning the daily wheel, and of course, slot machines.

Grand Theft Auto V is truly a masterpiece, and I am not ashamed to call it one of the greatest games of all-time. It even has the numbers to prove it, having sold 165,000,000 units to date, making it the second best-selling game in history behind Minecraft. I could go on for hours about this game, but really the best way to experience this game is to play it for yourself. If you‚Äôve always thought of GTA V as just another shooter with no personality, please, I urge you to give this game a chance. Though I can admit that the Online mode has its fair share of toxic players, this game is so much more than its reputation, and I will defend it as being a quality title until the day I die."

23414,"I had a worse sleep schedule when GTA5 first came out. I slept through my 14th birthday lmao. I would stay awake 24-48+ hours and then sleep for like a day. And I only ate once every 3 days. This is why I don't play MMOs anymore XD

I switched from catholic school to public school, and 8th grade in public school was like 1st grade in catholic school. So I was just mad bored and felt like I was wasting all my time, because I never went to school and I got straight 100s. I was just bored I guess.

But then my school was like ""we can't skip you a grade because that would make the other kids feel stupid. #equality"" so I just stopped going basically, because I learned way more outside of school anyway.

I kind of realized it's not worth wasting time with video games when my brother was hanging out with his friends, and was gonna invite me but I was alseep because I was up late playing video games, and they went to the boardwalk and saw a humpback whale jumping out of the water right off the beach.

If GTA5 is dead, use it as an opportunity to live your life. All I'm saying."

23449,I played this game for over a decade on Playstation Consoles. But on PC this game sucks. In almost all maps you see cheaters messing the experience up.
23450,"Always worth it to play the Story Mode for the first time, if you're a new player. GTA Online is in a rough state, modders are rampant, and the only real way to play the Online is by initiating windowed mode, and then right clicking the top bar of the application. When the pop down menu shows up, wait 10 seconds then click into the game again.

You are now in a Public Solo lobby, and can make deliveries for your illicit goods in peace. Be aware, there will be a steady trickle of other players over the next hour or so, but you can always just do the Public Solo lobby teq again."

I was under the delusion that rockstar could see the difference between a modder and me, this was not what I experienced.
I didn't really care that people killed me 17 times or that I shot people 10 in the head and nothing happened or even getting caged out of nowhere, I didn't care 'cause it wasn't me doing it and therefore nothing for me to worry about.
And yet here I am, banned for 30 days and my progress reset... meanwhile the modder is laughing and Rockstar wont even hear me out
I feel like I've been punched in the stomach for no reason, and not even by other players, they want to and even do that often, no I feel like I've been punched by the devs.

TL;DR: If you do decide to play online, have a VPN"

23663,"This review is about GTA V Online

I don't even know where to start... While the game has so much potential to provide a good gaming experience it somehow manages to fail at almost every aspect that makes a game enjoyable.

The COMMUNITY is the WORST i have EVER seen and i've been playing games for over 25 years. There is not a single lobby where there aren't any cheaters/hackers (and yes i purposely call em that). Be it the guy that just uses a mod menu to have fun with the game (those are not healthy for the game but somewhat tolerable) or the guy that teleports across the map to other players, having god mode on and randomly killing anyone they come across just to forcefully exit/crash your game when you give them a hard time doing that. It is ACTUALLY UNPLAYABLE in most public lobbies due to the insane amount of disturbed and sad souls out there. It's just a perfect example of what happens when anyone can have ""power"".
Even if there is no hacker trying way too hard to make your experience the worst, there are still unbelievably many people griefing/randomly killing anyone they come across. And the best part (sarcasm) about all that is that the game entitles you to do that. If someone tries to deliver products to get a little bit of money which they can spend on 1/5 of a car the whole lobby gets a message about what you are doing and that they should kill you and take those products.
The game tells you to be a toxic person. And since the game is catering to kids at least as much as to adults (lets not forget that this game is rated M = 17+) Rockstar is creating a prototype of gamers that are out of anyone's control.
It is a widely known fact that Rockstar does not listen to their community at all (if you can even call it a community because it contains the word unity). R* has made over 6 billion dollars from this game yet they leave the game in such an unbelievably bad shape, riddled with bugs, no anti cheat precautions, extremely out of touch additions, vehicles and stories, very bad controls, balancing, AI, obsolete features (damn the list doesnt even stop there) that is has nothing to do with what they got known for. This is a game that feels like it is halfway through developement.
They are milking their players with an insane amount of ignorance. And everyone who buys shark cards (ingame money for actual money) is actively supporting what they do.

How did this happen? Well, money! Money is the answer here. The developers take awards, smile at the cameras, bathe in money, ignore those that made them who they are and they are getting away with everything.

SOME PROS would be that it is a pretty decent looking game for such an old game and the driving has improved quite alot, also you definitely can have a good laugh from playing this game. I wish i could add more to this list but it gets tainted by everything bad about it way too much.

Would i recommend this to anyone? Well...no. MAYBE play the single player game if you can pick it up from a sale but if you think you will get that good ol' GTA vibe but with friends this time... be prepared for a hell of a surprise.

Rockstar has lost hundrets of thousands or even millions of potential buyers that liked to play what R* made them who they are, or at least who they were. If you could sell your soul to the devil, be sure they did not only sell their soul, they happily ripped it out of their bodies, took a piss on it, have it go through all circles of hell and laughed maniacally while getting a molten gold injection in their liveless bodies.


EDIT: Oh and please take a look at those reviews. Anyone with a working brain should realize it's mostly children and trolls writing those ""reviews"". Like come on.."

So yes I do them to prove a point of how much care RockStar has of the Game that they're still Milking for the last 8 years!!!"

23780,"I've played a combined 2000+ hours on this game and I hate every second. This game has had a death grip on me for almost 10 years. Will I stop? No. This game has been with me for almost half of my life. It is a part of me now. It is me. I am GTA Online. I am suffering and pain. I am the one who knocks, knocks at the gates of hell to let me in and take me out of the purgatory I have been stuck in for so long. I beg of you, someone, anyone, grab my hand, pull me out of the cold, wrinkly hands of Rockstar so I may be free once again. If they release a new DLC before I escape I fear I may be dragged back down into the deepest pits of GTA torture. I can't take it anymore. Anything would be better than spending another second on this game. Yet I must. I have no choice. This game is in my DNA. My genetic code is made up of flying motorcycles, angry blonde men, and garbage servers. Someone needs to clear my cache, as that seems to be the only solution Rockstar ever offers to any issues. My cache must be full, that is why I can't take it anymore. It all makes sense. Maybe if my cache is cleared, I will be free to live out to rest of my life in peace and solitude. This is my final plea: Reset my cache and release me. I want nothing more in this life."
23781,One of my personal favorites. I've spent years playing this game and made a lot of good memories with friends. I can't wait to see what Rockstar comes up with in the future for this series. 10/10

23833,"The game 9/10
The online would be 10/10, but hackers ruin it. Rockstar needs people to monitor it's servers.
Some people will crash the game, some people will give you money, some will spawn on you while you are
trying to supply yourself or deliver goods. God mode is a thing for them. So play the online if you want. sometimes it's 10/10 but if a hacker shows up and ruins everything the it's a big fat 0.  Every bad thing you can say about hackers insert here --->_________________________! You may end up repeating some things. Also I wrote this while angry. Feel free to share your story's."

I‚Äôd love to go back to the point of when it was actually popular.

Side note: Not worth playing multiplayer unless you like getting farmed for easy exp and if you fight back they come at you with an armada of stuff.

All around okay for story line but dang near impossible for multiplayer now if your new.

24010,"I`m a 47 years old freelancer and this game saved my life!
I born like a handicapped boy and I have problem with my legs. I was ""nailed"" to the chair basically entire my life.
Even when in my childhood I never had any friends cause of that. There`s was literally nothing I can do... I just wanted to be like an ordinary kid just running and playing some football. I hated this life. Nobody was understanding me except my family. Only thing I found really entertaining it was watching my brother plays. He noticed that and we started to sharing one old PC. It was really fun! We talked a lot of some games topics and he teach me basically everything I need to know. But after some time, my older brother have to move from our family to another town, because of his college and he gave me his old PC. PC gave me chance to forget everything I have experienced in my life. Time passed and I started to playing my life changing game, Grand Theft Auto 5. There I met my dear friends and my wife. They accepted me the way I was. Right now I have a family and my son. We still playing games sometimes and I hope this will stay as it is. Never lose your hope in the best!"

24027,"One of my most favorite games of all time.
While yes, hackers, griefers, and other hooligans of the sort, do add a sour taste.
it's to be expected, and actually welcomed in a game such as this, But nothing wrong with just relaxing, driving, having fun with random people and just hanging out.
I have done so much online, and enjoyed every second. I had gotten immersed so many times in the visuals, which is still amazing to this day.
Gameplay is great, for having so many aspects of the game to make it a whole. if it was just shooting and driving, I'm not sure it would be as good of a game to me.
I love just running around and exploring, while finding some good parkour spots on the roof tops and other bits.
after obtaining the mach 1 oppressor, it made gun running and other online freeroam missions easier and faster for me to solo play. it's also fun testing your skills on the oppressor to fly up to the top of the maze bank tower. oppressor mach 1 takes skill to properly use, and I implore you all to try and do some tricks through small gaps, or see how far you can get from the top of mount Chiliad, I got to the city itself, almost past the diamond casino.
Always a pleasure to play, especially with friends who have better internet than I. :P"
24028,very fun
24029,Just started playing a couple of months ago and the fact that the game is old doesn't make it any less worth playing.

24035,"What's fun in this game is screwing around in the sandbox after beating the game. What isn't fun is beating the game. You don't notice how many missions are tedious slogs until playing through it after beating the game, but holy hell. The Trevor crane mission is one of the worst video game levels ever created. If you pick this up, beat it once if you haven't. Otherwise, just download a 100% save file so you don't have to torture yourself with the story mode."

24038,"Would be cool if you could start the online mode and the support wouldn't be incompetent. They are literally not able to delete my rockstar account. Neither could they help me with my problem nor could they delete my account.
You know, in general good game and stuff, but it is like so annoying when you literally can't start the online mode. And please don't tell me I have not tried something. To say it in meme language: I've f*cking had it.
The problem was cause btw by closing the game (not alt f4) while you are in the online tutorial aaand congratulations, you have bugged your game. I guess I have discovered a new speedrun way to bug your game. If you are wondering why I closed the game while the tutorial was going on: I have a life. I hope this bug gets fixed, but whatever. Probably won't happen ever, since the support could not figure out my problem.

I also got BANNED for literal no reason and they will not let you appeal it, so beware you might just get randomly banned even though cheaters run rampant.

[b]just play in solo lobby if you still want to play GTAV Online peacefully.[/b]


Q: Should i exploit or get a mod menu in this game?
A: Why not both, rockstar won't give a damn about you since you're not hurting their revenue.
 
Q: Would i get banned doing exploit and stuff?
A: Maybe, since their banning attemps only end up banning the innocent instead of the perpetrator. 

Q: Why is rockstar not banning these hackers and modders???
A: Like i said, as long as it doesn't hurt their revenue THEY WON'T TAKE ANY DRASTIC ACTION.

Q: So if GTA Online is screwed, How's the singleplayer?
A: Decent.

Q: If there's so many bad stuff happening in GTA Online how do certain people have fun?!
A: They have their own way of having fun in that clusterduck of a game. (Including me)

Q: Should i buy it?
A: If you're a solo masochist do so, The only time where people (including me) will recommend you buying this game is either you want to play the [b]singleplayer experience ONLY[/b] or you have [b]3 other friend who own the game and would play together[/b]. other than that buy another game instead of this piece of crap."

24159,Online is hilariously bad. It would be fine if it was JUST the griefers and whatnot but the servers seem to be running on a hamster wheel because you literally can't do anything. It's impossible to play for more than 30 minutes without the game crashing or the server shitting itself and having to alt+f4. Sucks because from what I did play it looked pretty fun. Shame Rockstar doesn't feel like fixing the game that's made them a bajillion dollars. No idea how or why people play this garbage.

24222,This old 2013 game sucks balls. It is crazy that rock star games is still making people play this game 9 years later with nothing new to the franchise. It takes 20 minutes to load up. The menu is glitchy and runs like crap. The story mode is uninteresting and online is the most glitchy cancer you will ever play and the community of 9 year old idiots certainly does not help.

24232,"Fortnite Battle Royale sets itself apart by trading the traditional, bland military simulation vibe with vivid colors and an outstanding, freeform building system that‚Äôs unlike anything else in competitive multiplayer games.As its name suggests, Fortnite Battle Royale fits so neatly into the battle royale genre that blew up last year that the basic description sounds as standard as you can get: Up to 100 players are dropped onto a large but constantly shrinking map with the goal of gathering weapons and gear to become the last person or team left standing. But if you look just a little closer, it can‚Äôt be mistaken for any other game because the vehicle you‚Äôre skydiving out of is, inexplicably, a flying party bus ‚Äì a nice change of pace from a drab military plane ‚Äì and the place you land is a giant, beautifully colorful island, instead of a realistic landscape, surrounded by a violent storm.
Thankfully, unlike other battle royale games, like PlayerUnknown‚Äôs Battlegrounds, where an unlucky circle could leave getting out of the encroaching circle almost impossible, Fortnite‚Äôs map is at least small enough (relative to PUBG‚Äôs) that even if you have to run across the entire island to get to the safety of the randomly centered eye of the storm you run very little risk of being killed by the collapsing border.
On the island are several large and totally unique cities, each with their own style of structures ‚Äî a quaint suburb of houses, a giant office district filled with skyscrapers, or a retail area with an outdoor mall. Each city is full of vibrant colors, and the map as a whole has hundreds of buildings with randomly spawning loot in the form of guns, explosives, and healing items.
Wait, Which Fortnite Is This? Developed by Epic Games, Fortnite was originally conceived as a third-person, co-op, survival game where teams of players could mine resources and build structures to hold off hordes of undead enemies. That version, now a standalone game called Fortnite Save the World, still exists, but it‚Äôs not great. But as the battle royale genre started to gain popularity early in 2017, Epic adapted its survival game‚Äôs basic systems into something new: Fortnite Battle Royale, a separate, free-to-play game that feels like the perfect home for Save the World‚Äôs wayward mechanics.
Fortnite Battle Royale‚Äôs inventory management is, thankfully, simple by design. You get just five slots, so you‚Äôre forced to balance your arsenal of guns with your need for healing or explosives to deal with enemy structures. It‚Äôs a neat limiting factor that forced me to keep a mental shopping list of exactly what I was on the lookout for as I ran across the island, and to resist the urge to pick up anything else. With such specific needs in mind, every chest came with the thrill of hoping it would reveal the weapons I wanted most. Fortnite gives you plenty of ways to mix and match weapons, so even if that chest doesn‚Äôt come up with the exact item you want, you‚Äôll never feel powerless in a fight.
Once you do find the weapons you‚Äôre looking for, most fights in Fortnite go about the same way: You start with one shot from a slow-firing heavy weapon like a sniper rifle or pump shotgun in hopes of ending the fight before it really started, then (if needed) switch over to a faster assault rifle or tactical shotgun to carry out the rest of the battle. While it‚Äôs far from the only way to play, this combination seems to be the preferred method for almost every player and provides the foundation of almost every fight in Fortnite.
It‚Äôs a chaotic and fun system that makes fights a little more complicated.
It‚Äôs a lightning-fast system where fights can end in the blink of an eye with just one slight miss. This makes for a stark contrast from other battle royale games like PlayerUnknown‚Äôs Battlegrounds, which is filled with long, tense standoffs where sustained accuracy often matters more than a single well placed shot. It‚Äôs a chaotic and fun system that makes fights a little more complicated than simply aiming at your opponent and firing, but after a few hours with Fortnite I started to get the shoot-and-switch rhythm down and fights started to become almost automatic.
It‚Äôs the stuff around the shooting that helps Fortnite differentiate itself from every other battle royale game and shows off what truly makes it special: The building.
Carrying over the building system from Save the World is a brilliant choice that sets Battle Royale apart not just from other battle royale games, but most competitive multiplayer games in general. Just about everything that isn‚Äôt the ground can be mined for wood, stone, or steel, which can be used to create walls, stairs, and floors anywhere on the map (so long as some part of the structure touches the ground). It‚Äôs a massive system with so many possibilities that, at first blush, it can be daunting to try to figure out how to build the massive structures that others around you have created. But that‚Äôs one of the best things about Fortnite: It always keeps things simple.
That‚Äôs one of the best things about Fortnite: It always keeps things simple.
With just three primary tiles ‚Äì floors, walls, and stairs ‚Äì the building toolset may seem limited, but it‚Äôs got everything you really need. Whether it was building a staircase up to that hard-to-reach loot chest or quickly laying down an impromptu piece of cover to protect from an attacking enemy, I found I always had the tools I needed for the job at hand, and I could swap to the piece I needed without missing a beat. In fact, that swapping is so easy that one of my favorite moves is placing one platform and jumping off of it, then switch to another type in mid-air and place it before I land. That trick allows you to scale vertical walls or go straight up a mountain. While this may sound like an impressive feat of dexterity, Fortnite makes it so simple that almost anyone can pull it off ‚Äì and they do, making it one of the most common tricks to getting around the island.
The first time I really understood how Fortnite‚Äôs building and shooting played into one another came in the middle of a fight in Retail Row, one of the map‚Äôs many cities. Another player and I were sheepishly taking shots at one another from behind single walls we had built. After I ran out of ammo in my assault rifle, I was forced to turn to my shotgun ‚Äì a weapon I had largely disregarded up until this point. With the few resources I had left, I built stairs over my opponent‚Äôs wall, jumped off, flipped around, and shotgunned him. Looking back, it was as routine a play as it gets, but it was an absolute revelation for me at the time. Suddenly, everything made sense, and I realized that Fortnite Battle Royale is more about building than it is about shooting.
While the little things you can use it for may seem obvious ‚Äì like building stairs to get to the roof of a building, or making a wall to block an enemy‚Äôs shots ‚Äì the system also gives you room to think outside the box. You could build around a downed teammate that you can‚Äôt help yet, or create a decoy fort to lure enemies into an ambush while you wait behind a tree. The system even provides some elegant solutions to getting caught outside the trademark random circles of the battle royale genre: If you find yourself on the wrong side of a lake or chasm, no problem ‚Äì just make your own bridge to the other side.
One player lured me into his elaborate fortress of hallways in hopes of forcing me toward his waiting shotgun at the end of the maze.
Thanks to the building system‚Äôs simple but robust design, you can throw structures together in a way that suits your style. While some people love high towers that stretch into the sky, I like to keep things at a lower altitude, giving me more room to bounce between my platforms and the ground. One player I faced lured me into his elaborate fortress of hallways, with doors that led to nothing, all in hopes of forcing me toward his waiting shotgun at the end of the maze."

24261,"My first (yes first) GTA game I ever played and beaten all the way through.  A friend gifted me this game and REALLY REALLY wanted me to play it because of its story.  The game really tells a great story about friendship among other things.  The game play is eh...not bad.  A few of the missions (esp the flying ones) are bit rage inducing as they require precison at times, but overall forgiveable (I crashed my  helio and it only took damage were as in the real world it would be kaput).  Check point systems are pretty forgiveable as well.  

There's a lot to see and do in the game.  I didn't do the online part as I just wanted to do the main story.  Story aside, there's a good 50 hours of story telling here overall, that includes the side missions.

Overall a good hoot for your buck if you need some good laughs and bromance.

24280,"Dont buy this game.
The matchmaking system is completely busted and has been for as long as 8 years from what ive been able to find. R* in their infinite wisdom, made it so the only way to actually get people to join your missions and heists is to have an ""auto invite"" button. This is supposed to automatically invite people across different sessions. This system just decides to stop working for some people.. forever. Only inviting those currently in your session. If this happens to you you cannot play any missions or heists because you need 3 other people to join. Assuming you dont have a huge crew and your friends are offline. Your only hope of getting enough people to do a heist or any mission will be from the on-call system (which no one uses)
This started happening to me yesterday and has completely ruined the game for me as im new to pc and dont have many pc friends yet. Youd think a AAA dev would fix an 8 year old bug that completely ruins the experience for many players but i guess thats just to be expected from the geniuses over at R* considering that their only goal is to milk every penny from you and their game that came out almost a decade ago. 
Not to mention the ridiculous amount of cheaters and modders that infest this game. Sometimes they straight up just crash your game, or insta kill the entire lobby. Theres no point to progressing in this game because some loser with a mod menu can just be god and theres nothing you can do about it unless you want to stoop to their level and cheat.
I warned you. Dont buy it. Not even for the story mode. its 10 years old, just watch someone else play it."

Well, Online is garbage. It takes hours to grind for anything worth having, all the while you're dealing with modders you can't report in game, who can crash your game, and overall make the game a terrible experience. However Rockstar doesn't care, as these modders make up a signifigant part of the community. Likely 10% of the playerbase, given you'll always have one or two in every lobby. Really, there's no fun in it anymore. You can't escape modders who ruin the game, and rockstar has done nothing about this for years. Likely, they never will."

You used to be able to log in with any Social Club account like on the consoles. Not anymore.

Social Club DRM is tied to an email address I can't access. They permanently tied that to my Steam account without my consent, so now I can't play any RockStar games. I cut a ticket to them and they require you to have access to the email on the permanently tied account.

Edit: When I really tried to follow up with support, they sent an email indicating I can't play GTAV or any Rockstar products on this account if I disconnect my Steam account from my Social Club account.

24533,"it's good, but give us a new game rather than remaking this 100 times. you can do better rockstar"

24580,"Rockstar does not care about you, it does not care about your experience as a customer, it does not care if it's game is in a functioning state or not, all it cares about is the content of your wallet, and the fastest method of extracting it. 2/10 never buying any Rockstar product again."

24654,"i love the game for its non-PC stance... gotta love how this game goes against all the woke BS from nowdays.

only thing i dislike are the huge amount of minors who get angry at you for no reason and start using illegal third party mods/clients to bully you out of the session by spawning a bunch of stuff on top of you, teleporting you, killing everyone,...
they even go as far as making it look like you are the modder and trying to frame you for stuff you didnt do."

24760,There are plenty of things to do on this game and its a blast with friends.
24761,"The most on rails gta game ever, there seems to be next to nothing to do besides the missions which are good and the story is well written, but why make a large beautiful map when there is nothing interesting to do in it"

24768,Having access to this game through the pc is an epic experience!
24769,its nice
24770,10/10 as of 2022 the online content can be played mostly alone in a closed session so no need to worry about the modders and griefers. Also it is easily possible to get 1 million per 1 hour. The game is a good deal with 25‚Ç¨ + criminal enterprise pack + shark card.  This allows you to straight away buy Kosatka and grind the perico heist.
24771,its a fun game for all people
24772,"Good and funny game
"
24773,"This was an okay game back in 2013 when I first played through. 
The mechanics are good, the gameplay is pretty good, the graphics are good. 
The story and characters are painfully boring and generic. Trevor single handedly saved this game. Micheal is an insufferable boomer character who's story arc sucks. Franklin Is a generic token black guy who predictably says generic token things but lacks any depth. Trevor on the other hand has a rich storyline and was by far and away the most interesting thing about this game. 

for 2013 i would give it 4/5 stars because Trevors missions were awesome. 
for 2022 i give it 2/5 stars and the gameplay is good enough to mess around but not to play through the missions again."
24774,"It's a game!














With boobs!

I like men."
24775,Characters are so cringe and the online is only fun with cheats
24776,w
24777,bad
24778,its alright not my favorite
24779,fun but teediouse and also alot of modders
24780,very good
24781,"As an open world game, it's the cream of the crop. Detail is incredible down to the granular level. It could have more in-world things to do, but what's there serves the story well. If the game had more things to do in the world like fishing or sports, I might play it a lot more.

I'm not a big fan of the online portion of the game. Being unable to do a lot of content solo or in a private lobby kills it for me."
24782,it good
24783,d
24784,weep woop
24785,Don't buy this game in 2022 but it's ight FiveM for the win tho
24786,good
24787,very fun but sometime people not very nice
24788,Only fun if u have friends
24789,"Everyone knows what this game is, it's only the most profitable piece of media ever created. The singleplayer is fantastic in every way, Rockstar nailed everything here, gameplay, story, side content, variety, mission design (while still worse than the classic GTA games, it's at least a good upgrade from GTA 4's mission design), the game's core soundtrack is phenomenal and probably my favorite aspect of the game. Grand Theft Auto 5 may as well be the best GTA game.

Then comes Grand Theft Auto Online, which gives me immense pain. Everything that can go wrong with a GTA game, it goes wrong in GTA Online. And to top the downgraded GTA 5 gameplay, shitty mini stories, mediocre side content, awful economy, AWFUL mission design, insane amount of paywalls, Cockstar's Social Club is probably the worst thing ever created, since by playing any game that requires Social Club, your IP address is exposed as Social Club runs on P2P servers (multi billion dollar company by the way).

I only recommend this if you never had the chance to play the story, otherwise if you're getting this for Online, buy something else."
24790,BORING
24791,great game for the right age group.

24801,Amazing Game!! Iv'e been playing for a while now and the community in this game is fantastic. Other players are very helpful and almost never troll. Iv'e only seen a hacker once and it was a nice hacker that helped me. The chat is clean and almost never spanned. The loading times are some of the best Iv'e ever seen and I haven't come across any bugs yet. Overall amazing game! 10/10 would recommend!!

24844,"I originally had this game in my Rockstar Games Acount. 
The account was hacked and somehow the game was stolen. I made a ticket, zero help or support from Rockstar. (by the way, to make a ""2 step autentication"" you need to download some app on your mobile device. Really?) 
Now I saw the game on sale, here on Steam. I tought why not? 
So, hoping that I would get rid of all the launchers and useless things that Rockstar forces you to log in on and play on, I bought the game on Steam. To play it on steam. 
It just doest't happen. You still need tons of launchers and accounts from Rockstar. On top of that, the game doesn't save the settings, I have tryed for 1 hour... 
In the end I requested a refund for this product because, in my opinion, no one should spend money on Rockstar products. No custommer support, not to mention that I had to search on Google to see what I ned to do to open a ticket. 
At the end of the day they couldn't care less if you have any issue. 
As much as I liked GTA, I will never buy any Rockstar product. A cracked copy is the best option here, same thing in terms of support, 0. At least no money is lost."

2. All exploiters who are ruining the game for everyone

3. The Oppressor. Great vehicle, but serves no purpose other than to be annoying to others. Combat is way more fun when it isn't used

4. All the cashgrabbing techniques rockstar uses to monetize. It is one thing to allow a person to buy money in their game, it's a whole other thing if you basically require it to get started, and you sell it at highly inflated prices."

It is being developed still after ten years by people who know how to make a good game and could use their creative expertise to craft bigger better things, yet instead decide to money-grub off pre-pubescent, cheeto-fingered monkeys who like to blow you up for twenty in-game dollars. This game should be avoided at all costs by everyone and stop feeding the cash cow for Rockstar. I'm still going to play it, mind you... I'm just saying I shouldn't!"
24920,Sometimes there is the odd bug but it is a very fun game
24921,"The game is plagued by hackers. If you play with friends - yeah, it can be fun. Generally speaking though, there will be hackers. If you're lucky enough to avoid a lobby without hackers (besides a private lobby), you'll still probably encounter an old fashioned griefer or two. 

I've played this game since the 360, it's never going to get better. As long as dumbasses buy shark cards, nothing will change. Enjoy the game for what it is. A toxic waste dump where there's sporadic fun to be had - so long as you can avoid raging at someone blowing up everyone in the server. Find a friend, make a few million, then realize online is a hollow treadmill for cash."

 He recorrido las calles de Los Santos mas veces de las que he recorrido las calles de la ciudad en la que vivo, decir que amo este juego es poco.

25219,Uns dos maiores jogos de todos os tempos.
25220,gta iv or gta v
25221,its meh
25222,gta 5 is a blatant cash grab that barely functions. The online version is so horrendous I am suprised that they are making a new game. It is based off of excessive grinding and griefing to make the grind even longer. Along with rockstar's inability or care to stop modding this turns the game into a disaster of modders griefing entire lobbys and making the game unplayable. There needs to be some way that modders can block the report feature along with general bug fixes to the regular online mode. I believe this is possible to fix but since this toxic community forces more people to buy shark cards I doubt that they care enough to fix these issues
25223,"I only recommend half of this game. If you're interested in primarily the online, do not get your hopes up. It is extremely grindy and monetized like a free to play game. Most missions are bland and largely not worth doing from both a reward and fun perspective. Lobbies are also plagued with griefers and hackers. Also, [b]USE A VPN[/b]. The online is all peer to peer and there are no ip address protections.

Now onto the good half, story mode. Story mode offers a fun narrative with decent set pieces. The structure of the game does feel dated though. I know the game is called Grand theft Auto but there is so much brain dead driving back and forth, only being made somewhat bearable when dialogue is happening. Almost every mission, you need to drive to, then watch a cutscene, then drive somewhere else to do some shooting (or some other set piece); rinse and repeat. However, when you are not doing an excessive amount of driving, the missions are pretty enjoyable. Side missions though are a mixed bag. Some are good and others you're driving a slow tow truck to cover someone's job. Despite, all my gripes I still had a very good time with this game and I'd like to attribute this to the larger than life characters, heists, and set pieces."
25224,Its a good game. Perfect for people who like to grind. Bad for people who dont

Very immersive and diverse levels, gets addictive because of Gta 5 money you got ta make, also you buy a shark card to help boost your gaming experience, so thats most of the good points.

Bad: Hacking, Modding goes on and on with PC, very frustrating
         The only other thing i can think of is, same Map all the time of East L A
          Chat client could improve

The online mode has its troubles and is a grind-fest of skinnerboxxing for whales with open wallets and poor impulse control, but don't let that ruin the game for you.  Online has just been bolted on to the base game after the fact, and can safely be entirely ignored."

25585,"Grant Theft Auto is a great game, a very well designed, very well written, very well balanced game that mark the high point of current gen games in almost every aspect. It pains me to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because one obvious problem which I absolutely can not, and will not overlook no matter how great the game is. And that problem is the misogyny through out the game.

If you want to read about how great the game is, you can read any critic reviews from Polygon, gamespot or any other game sites. And I agree with all them, it's a great game. But I want to talk about women in GTA V, or more precisely, the lack of such.

Character development in GTA V is quite interesting. Every single one of characters you end up playing, meeting, working for, fighting with or against, eventually killing...are total assholes. They're selfish, obnoxious, arrogant, stupid, and completely insane. They rob banks and kill people without the slightest remorse, they use other people and set them up to killed while pretend to be peaceful and spiritual. They're the everyday morons you see exaggerated 100 times. People would argue that because everyone in Los Santos is horrible in their own way, it is acceptable to have annoying and despicable women character as well.

Here's the difference though. The main characters: Michael, Trevor and Franklin, as well as some of major supporting characters such as Leslie, Dave, or Lamar... They're horrible people indeed, but they all have some kind of redeeming quality, especially the 3 main characters. They're very well crafted extremely flawed characters with a lot of depth, people you despise yet can't help to sympathize. They're people you can relate to from a certain level. Not from being a psychopath (I hope), but realizing that they're facing the same problem we face everyday.

But the girls in Los Santos are annoying, shallow, pathetic, with no redeeming quality. They're there to be funny, or to create obstacles for the main character to overcome. Most of them have very thin back stories, aren't all that interesting, and overall, they're just very badly written. It's almost as if the writers are so taken away by the dynamics between the 3 main character (The bro-mance between Trevor and Michael, the father/son relationship between Michael and Franklin), they just don't care about add women into the game.

I have a half joking theory that Rockstar writers are probably closet women hating gay guys. They're willing to write a main character who's gay, yet unwilling to write a good female character. It's not that they can't, Bonnie in Red Dead Redemption is actually well written, so is Katie in GTA IV. They're real women with real personality, and strong in their own way. I was quite hopeful to see some real changes in GTA V, especially after all those outcry for better female characters in games over the past few years. Oh how was I bitterly disappointed. It would be so nice to have a strong (homicidal or not) girl in GTA universe.

Eventually, I think the writers just don't care. Why should they? The game is making insane amount of money even as misogyny as it is. There's no incentive for them to write good female character other than it would be nice to write good female characters as decent writers.

I guess I should talk a little bit about the actual game other than whine about misogyny. Like I said, GTA V is great. But what impressed me the most is how well balanced the game is. The world is huge, but never overwhelming; the missions are diverse and fun but never chaotic; the character switching is fun and exciting but never hectic even in the middle of the heated gun battle. All of the heists are very well designed, and very fun to play out (I wish there're more).

Michael is probably my most favorite characters in all Rockstar games. He's such a complex character and so different from your typical game protagonist. His psychotic and almost romantic attachment with Trevor, his mentor/fatherly attitude towards Franklin, while still remain a hard cold selfish killer.

Regardless how I think about their misogyny, GTA V is a great game. You should play it."

25612,"The single player is good, a solid experience with enjoyable and memorable characters in a world space that is fun to explore and full of interesting side stuff.

The multiplayer is a thing. It is a grind and sometimes feels more like a job than a gaming experience.
There are some fun and interesting missions but where the single player is over the top but relatively grounded the online wishes it was saints row with flying motorcycles and energy weapons.

I played through the games single player twice on the Xbox so almost all of my play time on PC is dedicated to the online side of things.
For all of its flaws the online is something I do keep coming back to and the game seems to hit in waves for me and my people and really if you have regular friends to play with that is prolly the best part of it all."

[h1] Review [/h1]
[b] Summary - [/b] Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV, and the fifteenth installment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story follows three protagonists - retired bank robber Michael De Santa, street gangster Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips - and their attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. The open world design lets players freely roam San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.

[b] Story - [/b] GTA V has one of the best stories in my opinion. You will come across some of the best voice acting and just amazing characters in this game. With some twists and interesting story pieces to see, I had an absolute blast with it. I don‚Äôt want to say much or anything at all about it. You need to experience the story on your own.

[b] Gameplay - [/b] The gameplay is incredible for GTA V. The driving is fun, the combat is amazing and really smooth. You have so many vehicles and places to see. A ton of weapons and ways to cause chaos. You can find some funny easter eggs and never really experienced any bugs that took me out of the experience. The gameplay is like your typical GTA experience, but with some adding flavor. The single player experience was a masterpiece to me, and hopefully the new GTA game builds up on this and gives you even more freedom when the new one comes out (if they release another one).

[b] Multiplayer - [/b] Okay, so the multiplayer has some problems I have to say. This section really hurts me. I use to play a ton of GTA multiplayer on Xbox one. I probably have like 300+ hours on it alone. Let‚Äôs start with progression. Getting money in this game is ridiculous. You have to grind your life away to even make a good bit of money. Now you have a good bit of money, well have fun buying awesome rides and even getting a cool house. I get it that it wants you to work for these things, but the way they do it is scummy. A lot of stuff in the multiplayer is so expensive, it‚Äôs like they want to pressure you to buy shark cards so you can get what you want. The Shark Card system is a complete joke. I hate games that do this. Now if it's free to play, then fine I will let that pass, but this game is just ridiculous. Please don‚Äôt spend real money for in-game currency. The best way to get money is to do heists, and that can take a while to get, and so repetitive.The lobbies can be toxic too, but this is GTA afterall so that's to be expected. The multiplayer can be a let down to me. I feel like if they just make things cheaper and more accessible, I feel like it would be more enjoyable. Oh and done forget about the hacker problem, just to add the icing on the cake. I know I trashed the multiplayer so far, but if you can somehow excuse all those negative, I found the multiplayer part of GTA to be actually really fun and addicting with friends. You have a ton of content and will always have something to aim for online. It will take you time, but if you got a ton of free time then you may actually love the multiplayer. PVP as well so that's a plus, something Rockstar is really good at in my eyes. The multiplayer is amazing, but it does have one too many flaws for me to get back into.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
	[*] Amazing story
	[*] Great dialogue 
	[*] Top notch voice acting
	[*] Every character feels unique
	[*] Multiplayer has a lot of content
	[*] Great graphics at the time
	[*] Really well optimized
	[*] Lots of small details
[/list]

[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[list]
	[*] Multiplayer is super grindy
	[*] Multiplayer can be buggy and kicks you out of server
	[*] Single Player can be kinda boring after beating everything
	[*] Long load times
	[*] Multiplayer heists can be repetitive after a while
	[*] Tons of hackers online
	[*] You can get into toxic servers pretty often

25704,"alright to start of this review i want to make clear that this game actually is really good WHEN ITS WORKING. 
But as by now everyone knows and making my review pretty pointless. gta online has some MAJOR issues to this day that rockstar should look at and fix if they plan to keep this game running even longer than it already has. 

First of i'll talk about general balancing issues that ruin the game on a serious level. 
in my opinion the most problematic balance problem in this game is the opressor MK2 which just ruins any other vehicle with relative ease.
And the only vehicles like the buffalo STX, terrorbyte and MOC that ARE resilliant to the MK2 don't have the offensive capacity to even fight back so you're still at a major disadvantage. 

Guns in general are a complete waste of spots for anything but NPC missions which means you only really need 1-2 guns a sniper rifle and an assault rifle. 
Fighting players pretty much means you're either supposed to use rocket launchers or any vehicle that, you guessed it has rocket launchers.

To shorter up the review i'm moving straight to bugs since i believe its what ruins the game the most. 
As someone that uses the casino heist as the main source of my income i'm genuinely dissapointed this company hasn't done anything to fix issues that have been in the game for atleast 2 years which include a bug that i just ran in 4 times in a row. 

Entering your arcade will fairly often lead to an infinite loading screen which you can do nothing about. 
And this happens both when you generally just try to enter it OR when you've finished the casino heist and the ending cutscene is supposed to play so it doesn't and now you're stuck on a white screen. 

launcher itself is also downright abysmal a lot of the time to a point where i personally have to close the rockstar app multiple times before i can even launch gta. 
the issue here is that steam says i'm running gta but the application never opens so i'm forced to task manager close the rockstar app and then open it as administrator which only has a 50% chance of fixing the issue.

all this being said i do want to point out positive sides of gta V that rockstar has done well since the game is obviously popular for a reason 
-graphics 
-sound
-music
-car designs
-customization options for most vehicles

these are all incredibly well done and nothing feels cooler than riding out of LS customs with one of the newly released cars and rockstar gets this right with pretty much every content update they release.
I feel like talking about the positive things in gta is a bit redundant since pretty much everyone already knows the game so i won't go into detail about the good things i've mentioned and even if i did my verdict would not change.

yes the positives generally outweight the negatives but the game being this old and consistently updated has no excuse to run this poorly even on high end computers with its numerous bugs that happen way to frequently and its toxic playstyle vehicles that rockstar refuses to do anything about."

But there are some very irksome things about this game as a whole, especially in the Online mode (more on that later). 

But anyways, the first problem I have with this game is how boring some of the missions can be, like more than half of them are just you driving from point A to point B and completing some menial task. For example, there is one mission where you are playing as Franklin, and the whole point of the mission is to tow vehicles with a tow truck... how exciting. Of course I don't expect every mission to be jam packed with action, but the amount of missions that are like this is just ridiculous.

Another problem I have with the single player is how under utilised the whole open world is. Compared to GTA IV and even San Andreas, there is not a whole lot going for activities. You have golf, tennis, yoga, triathlons, bike races and that's really it. Sure, there are the strangers and freaks missions, but these quickly get old in my opinion. And once you've completed the story it just feels like a husk. And it's a shame really, because the world can be very fun to explore, but it doesn't feel there is much incentive (besides you just making arbitrary goals) to.

Now, onto the Online mode, and my god, what a cesspit it has become. Ignoring the hackers and the amount of people flying around on their Oppressor MK IIs killing everything insight, the grind is way TOO damn much. The in-game economy is not balanced enough, you get paid so little for activities and things costs millions of dollars. Oh yeah, and in order to even do some of the better paying content you need to first buy certain buildings/vehicles! It has gotten way too out of hand, but Rockstar knows there is nothing stopping them. Sure mod menus exist, but not everyone wants to use them.

This game is game is/has always been a cash cow for Rockstar, and it shows by the lack of development of any other GTA games in past 10 years. Don't get me wrong, this game is awesome and is an incredible feat in game design as a whole, but there are so many things wrong with it that I can't recommend it to anyone new, especially if you are looking to play Online."

25894,"if you're buying this for gta online, don't. don't play gta online on pc. Rockstar did not do the bare minimum to protect you from cheaters. I would not be surprised if it came out that there is an RCE exploit for this game that affects clients, since cheaters can already crash your game via buffer overflows."

25941,"Single player was fun. multiplayer was okie dokie.
Also called a loading screen simulator
4/5 stars"
25942,"If you like open world games based on real life with a long-running story this game is definitely the pick for you. 

There's almost nothing about this game that's not to like. The story is compelling with an interesting set of characters that you'll care for, even though they're a bunch of criminals. I think the story is very fun to play and I also think that the game had a creative mission design, which made the story even more fun to play. 

Next to the very compelling story the game also has a big open world with a lot of things to do which sometimes mirror real life, like going to the amusement park. I think it's a blend of not knowing what you're going to come across and oppurtunities that make the open world really fun to explore. 

Moreover, this game has a very amusing online mode which is very amusing when you're playing with your friends. 

To summarize, I think this game is really phenomenal and I think it's one of the best games ever made. I give this game a 9/10."
25943,"GTA V is vry fun. Driving and listening to music is a vibe, and so is shooting people."
25944,"The singleplayer is fantastic, great storyline, great gameplay.. BUT Online is just stupid.. I had 6 modders with those stupid paid mod applications for GTA V yesterday blowing everybody up on the map constantly, spawning shit, kicking people.. It's ridiculous, i miss when you'd have a group of people in a lobby and we didn't know each other, but we'd hang and kill cops and do dumb shit.. but now? everybody wants to be in god mode and just fuck everything up.. It's sad.. But i have a small group of friends and we still play online in closed friend sessions cause fuck all that modder bull shit.. Rockstar sucks at keeping that stuff outta their games."

25953,"GRAND THEFT AUTO V

This latest chapter in Rockstar's highly popular GTA series takes place in the city Los Santos
based on Los Angeles.
You play as three characters and switch between them at forced events during the story or when you feel like it.
There is Michael whos life looks like he could be a character based a littlebit on Tony Soprano?
A hasbeen gangster now in witness protection with a family life with big house fancy cars and children who are spoiled rich kids + a wife who is bored and doesnt understands him.
Then there is stereotype Franklin a young black guy livin in the hood
he is ready for almost anything to earn a buck and looking to do the next big score.
And ofcause not to forget Trevor
a redneck psychopath who lives outside of Los Santos in a trailer
has a methlab and calls himself a businessman.
Trevor is an ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•
he doesnt care about anyone then himself
and he uses and abuses people around him physcical and mentally.
He use to work with Michael they had a team of big score Heisters.
These 3 characters ofcause ends up crossing eachovers paths and creates havoc in Los Santos :)

Trevor is the star of the show
he is crazy and has the best lines and is funny ashell.
Franklin is also appealing
its funny to hear him banther with his friends from the hood.
Michael who i thought before playing the game would be my favourit?
Is the most boring of the three
he is having a midlife crysis his whining becomes tireing.
Michael and Trevors relationship about the past gets annoying
and takes way to much space in the overall story.
To be honest the story over all in GTA V could have been so much better.
Many of the gameplay missions are lame and i was bored out of my mind :(
and too much Michaels family problems too cliche.
Also doing Yoga in a mission really?
Getting high and shooting aliens?
As far as i know this game is not for 12 year olds?
Who might find joy in getting high in a game?

But there was also some really cool ones
like planning Heists and getting to chose how to approch it?
The graphics are simply amazing! In GTA V
So many details
and Los Santos and the areas around it feels so alive
with people going around living their little AI lifes and animals doing their thing.
The game mechanism like controlling your character
and driving vehicles works very well and is a joy.

Grand Theft Auto Online
Is the best part of the game!
Here you have the hole game map to your disposal
where you can play with or against friends or other players.
Do Heists or other Co Op missions.

26007,"A true masterpiece of game design, but on Steam a flawed implementation.

This is yet another title (looking at you, Ubisoft) where purchasing on Steam only buys you a new third-party launcher. One with its own issues that immediately blocked me from accessing my purchase. And another thing that will likely erase my purchase when Rockstar decides to stop supporting its launcher.

This is not what the vision of Steam was supposed to be. A dozen and one third party stores and launchers linked to Steam. What's the point of Steam then? Why not just buy it anywhere since it won't run under Steam anyway, and won't be limited to Steam's policy of respecting the customer?

Just get a cheap copy on console and then there's less money to throw away when one company or another decides to obsolete the product.

If you do still buy this on Steam, know that you'll be informed upon launch that your soul and key belong to Rockstar, it will be linked to your ""Rockstar Social Club"" account (better not lose that), and Valve/Steam is no longer part of the equation, despite the transaction, platofmr, and independent account and EULA you just had with them.

This was not the original dream when Steam launched. It is not the way."

"
26058,"I'm going to have different category's for this game so this is the rating for each
Graphics 10/10 for its time 

controls 9.8/10 fixed many controls in previous games and made a option to change them

Story mode 7.5/10 pretty fun but there is some flaws in creativity of the missions and some parts of story are useless info

online 8/10 really fun especially with Friends but there is many modders and everything is really expensive

soundtrack 6/10 not as original and catchy as the older titles in the franchise

replayabillity 9.5/10 there is a ton of playabillity in the online mode and in story there is still some

The critics:  Gta 5 is a really impressive game made by rockstar and will definitely go out in the gaming records but it doesn't have enough greatness to keep that title in the future

rating 8.5/10"

26212,"GTA5 represents all the content that Grand Theft Auto 4 brought 5 years ago and is enhanced in all aspects. Of all the perceived elements, GTA5 achieves a higher level of achievement, and its design itself is ambitious. No game's scene map has reached such a scale and size, and behind its humor and violence is a spicy wisdom. It tells a compelling, unexpected, and thought-provoking storyline without interfering with the player's free adventures in San Andreas. This is one of the best video games of all time."

26219,Great game one to remember
26220,"Great game, especially if you enjoy cannibalism. CANNIBALS UNITE!"
26221,"This game is a mess, a good mess but nonetheless. The story is entertaining beyond limits and I enjoyed 9/10 missions. Playing this game a couple of years ago it was fun to build up your bank account from the ground up, but now with all this content, nobody needs bussinesses anymore, just ceo perico heist or diamond casino heist, the adversary modes are fun but are full of more hackers than a chinese internet cafe. Not to forget to mention, the hundreds of 10-15 year olds who were neglected by their parents and take out their anger on you with oppressors and big Fk off tanks. This game used to be fun, now it isn't, unless you have 3 good friends to play with, then you can have a lot of fun. ;)"
26222,itts a good game if you have homicidal thoughts

26243,"This game is crap. The online version simply never loads...EVER. I've tried all the stupid tricks recommended for solo lobby, etc., still does NOT work. The only way I can play this game is in story mode. Career network engineer for DECADES. It's not my network, it's not my router, it's not my computer, it's not sunspots, it's not my internet connection (pretty much guarantee it's faster than anyone's who is currently reading this), no I'm not rebooting my router(s)/modem, no I'm continuing to suspend processes trying to trick it into working. I'm simply getting a refund and moving on to some other game, ALL of which work on this same PC, same network, same internet connection, same everything.  Basically, if you're diehard PC gamer, just skip this and all other Rockstar games, which are all just crap console ports."
26244,"Really good game, but a lot of bad people in the way of getting killed randomly and greifed but over all really fun!"

26277,"If your looking for a game with a lot of Hackers then you came to the right place. if you are a legit player just trying to play a came then you need to stay as far away from this game as you can unless you like that sort of abuse. players that have a 5mil. lvl and 1 &1/2 mil KDR. as far as support goes then you can forget that as well they have no clue on what going on you can report all you want and it still goes on & on. as far as the answer that you will get from support is ""check your files"". they check nothing and seem to be brain dead to the game itself. if you try and build your business then the game entice's higher levels to come and attack you and also destroy your cargo. no benefit in it but it makes the higher lvl's happy. if you purchase this game then you are looking for punishment. good luck"

26291,"This game used to a ton of fun on console, but playing on PC in 2022 gives you at least one or two cheaters in every lobby, and multiple people spamming you with website urls on the phone in-game to buy cheats. Constant spamming + cheaters in virtually every lobby. Also, good luck if you are trying to transfer an account to PC, it didn't work for me.

EDIT: I put in another like 50 hours after writing the first review, and I will say that while cheating is a huge issue (make sure you have a vpn, they can see your IP address) the players on here are also way friendlier than I remember and seeing things like lobby-wide car meetups is not a rare occurrence like it used to be. Most people are extremely friendly and the ones that like to grief other people sometimes get their game crashed by cheaters or are kicked out of lobbies by everyone in them. And most lobbies are just a few people, but if you want to vibe in a lobby of 20+ people you can find those as well. The amount of high quality, engaging content that Rockstar has put in since 2017 is crazy high and for 30$ I would absolutely recommend this game despite the cheating that happens just for the content alone, there is so much of it."

26386,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

En la orilla de la granja
Un gran cerco le pusieron
Para que siga jalando
Y no se vaya el granjero
Porque la perra lo muerde

26521,"9 years later and the beating heart of the GTA online community is still griefers and modders.
You can switch through 20 sessions of 30 players and each session will have over 15 modders.

- They will freeze your car and force character to stand outside, to be killed or orbited.
- They will force invite the whole session into 1 apartment then kick them out and kill them all outside
- They will make you randomly teleport to the middle of the ocean, car and all.
- They will attack you using godmode and non reloading infinite ammo explosive weapons
- They will place cages on you.
- If you slip into passive before a guy shoots you to death, he will crash your game for your trouble.
- They will spawn 100 passenger jets on your head until you crash
- They can teleport around the map killing players instantly.
- They can disable your passive mode
- They can just appear in your car, take copies of your car and personal plate to spawn when they like.
- They can force you to commit suicide
- They can spam your in game phone with messages fast
- The modders bypass all report and kick functions but can kick or crash you out of a server anytime
- Your friend only session can be invaded by random modders, no security.
- You can only votekick or report 1 player per hour XDDDDDDD how stupid rockstar were XDDDD
AND THIS IS JUST A FEW OF THE THINGS THEY CAN DO that you will see in 1 day  !

For me GTA is one of the greatest titles of all time, but GTA online is the worst online game I have ever played. 
Every session filled with hate and grief and whining about godmode blah blah blah.
Disgusting game and Rockstar/TakeTwo have a long way to go before they will figure out how to make a world class game !
I will absolutely not buy or even play GTA 6 if it ever comes out, pure trash, will be hacked to pieces in a day. And then go through all the above again. and more. NO THANK YOU !

Although a lot of the general online community these days are trolls and griefers, so most the people reading this, live for trolling and griefing and will download GTA in a hot second.

GTA is one of the most popular games still because, no skill required to kill players, get free kills all day long annoying other players who try to earn money, you have a wide selection of illegal undetectable online mods to grief with.

It is the ultimate game for the scummiest low levels of society who never had attention from parents and so try to grab that attention from other players by using mods and just killing.
It really is quite sad.

26560,"I can no longer recommend this game in good faith with the GTA Online portion after being suspended after 300 hours of playing the game and grinding away at the Agency, Auto Shop, and Heists and just enjoying the game with a band of friends. Losing my character with all the progress I made when I have done nothing wrong except literally going to bed one day and waking up to see I've been suspended. Now I outright fear even going onto the game even after the suspension is gone in a month along with my other friends and never being able to play again.

The policy that is in place where one is not allowed to appeal a suspension or a ban is absolutely insane, and I know there are other innocent players that have been getting false flagged by their overly zealous anti-cheat. But due to their policy anyone who plays legit and gets flagged or even sabotaged by a modder cannot do anything about it but accept their fate of losing all their progress the first time and than condemned to just never play again the second time they get flagged. 

One can go onto Youtube, Reddit or even check other Reviews here on Steam on this matter. They've basically shut down the customer service over the phone and if you respond on their support questioning your suspension you just get the same copy pasted message and your requests locked. Even speaking to a live service rep via their website just results in you immediately getting the same thing and them closing out the chat. You won't even get to know why you were suspended/banned as they stated they will not release any information on why action was taken against you."

Modders, my question is why has this game been out since 2013 and Rockstar still hasn't fixed this issue. This not only ruins your experience, but it is unsafe, as they can easily get your location. 2. Glitches, this is the biggest issue. A few minutes ago i spent 30 minutes doing a mission, and i had to leave the game because it got stuck on a loading screen. Super annoying, now i have to do it again hoping it won't just glitch me out of the game. 3. Infrequent updates. Come on, one of the most popular games ever, gets an small update that doesn't even add that much every year or two. That is all, very fun, but this is very annoying. having to redo things constantly because the game gets stuck on a loading screen? Can't even join a new session, have to forcefully quit the game. I just don't understand how this game has been out since 2013, and still manages to have this many bugs and this many other problems."

26598,"The game throws many things at you at once, and there are a lot of modders/hackers who can ruin the game and can view your IP address. they will use god mode and other many things. Lastly, Rockstar Games never responds and never tries to fix anything. IT'S A BILLION-DOLLAR GAME. The game is normal 40-50 dollars and this is very costly for them not to fix any issues is very dumb of them. There are many good parts of this game but the problems of this game are getting bigger and bigger every day. Feel free to comment on my review!"

26604,Game is better on console. Online is dead if you trying to do jobs. Lobbies have hackers out the a55 but what do you expect for a old a55 game like this.  It's a shame because this game is seriously one of the best games that ever released. I wish I could transfer my ps4 character over because of how dead these servers are it would take me like 10000 years to get back what I have on my PSN account.

I keep trying to step back in hoping they maybe finally fixed some of the many, many, many problems and it's just worse and worse every time. The whole thing is one big money pit full of basically broken missions with broken ai and broken mechanics that they keep wanting more and more money to gain access to. I really hope that whatever they (ROCKSTAR) makes next fails super hard. They refused to listen to what the people that play the game want and there just isn't any reason to play anything new they make because it's all gonna be woke neutered garbage mixed with some even worse game play and 10$ cars. I played this game for years on Playstation before getting it on PC. I guess I hoped that it was somehow more playable on PC, but, if anything, besides the graphical improvement, it's even MORE frustrating to play. The whole thing is really just set up to sell Shark Cards and it's not really a game anymore."

26663,"This is one of my favourite games of all time. The story mode is a masterpiece and the online is alright. The story mode is full of fun, interesting missions to complete and I think they did a brilliant job with the characters. The chemistry between the trio makes them impossible to defeat during the heists. The open world is just fantastic and there is basically no limits to what you can do. Every mission helps you discover new areas in the map and shows you gameplay mechanics. 

The online mode is great, but ruined by modders and Rockstar Games being greedy. The freeplay can be brilliant when your messing around with other players and fighting each other, but can be ruined by modders killing everyone in the lobby. The missions are okay, some of them are brilliant, like the Cayo Perico heist or The Contract missions, but most of them are very repetitive. Rockstar Games don't really update the game that much, only every few months, causing the game to get boring after playing for a few days. I don't like the fact that everything is so cheap, and the heists pay so much, for example if you do 5 Cayo Perico heists then you can afford to buy the best vehicle in the game. I think they should make things a bit more expensive or make the heists pay out a bit less in order to fix this.

However, it is no secret that it's online content is the most popular. With this in mind, and from personal experience, I would advise those new to the game, specifically the ""online"" aspects of the game, to hunt down and collect all figures as soon as possible. This is a great early boost to your RP levels, which in turn boosts the fun in the game since attaining RP levels/ranks unlocks further content.

At any rate, this is not a guide it is a review, so let's get back on track. ‚öû‚Çç‚ëÖ·ê¢.À¨.·ê¢‚Çé ‚ô° 

Would I recommend this game to new players? of course.
Does this game have it's faults? of course.

Will I elaborate on either of the above? no, not this late in the game's age.

Look, if you enjoy a massive free roam ""sandbox"" type world, with endless missions, ability to own your own house & business, customise your weapons, clothes, houses, vehicles and even your crew & crew ranks? (I could say far more!)

If yes, then definitely get this game.
If no, then... don't. ‡´Æ‚ÇçÀ∂ ‚Ä¢. ‚Ä¢ ‚ëÖ‚Çé·Éê ‚ô°

P.S.
Despite a new GTA being well underway, Rockstar is still consistently updating this game.

26717,"Unfortunately I have a love hate relationship with GTA. I wasn't allowed to play GTA growing up, so when GTA V came out I was finally old enough to buy it myself. Sadly I had sold my 360 to purchase my PC and Rockstar didn't release GTA V for PC yet....Finally after two years of waiting, it released on steam. I remember all my friends and I staying up late to download the game when it released so we could play it after school. I was hyped. When school let out we all raced home to play. All my friends started playing immediately; except me. My game would crash during the Police siren intro. Every time. I tried it so many times I logged 7hrs of playtime just from the game crashing every 15 seconds. Luckily Steam still issued me a refund because a lot of people were having the same problem. Years go by and I watch from the sidelines as my friends complete heists together and make memories. In 2018 I finally purchase GTA V again to try it. It worked. But by then the lobbies were a complete shit show. Just chaotic. Heard the single player is pretty good. Sadly I had to watch it on YouTube."

26752,"honestly fortnite Battle Royale sets itself apart by trading the traditional, bland military simulation vibe with vivid colors and an outstanding, freeform building system that‚Äôs unlike anything else in competitive multiplayer games.As its name suggests, Fortnite Battle Royale fits so neatly into the battle royale genre that blew up last year that the basic description sounds as standard as you can get: Up to 100 players are dropped onto a large but constantly shrinking map with the goal of gathering weapons and gear to become the last person or team left standing. But if you look just a little closer, it can‚Äôt be mistaken for any other game because the vehicle you‚Äôre skydiving out of is, inexplicably, a flying party bus ‚Äì a nice change of pace from a drab military plane ‚Äì and the place you land is a giant, beautifully colorful island, instead of a realistic landscape, surrounded by a violent storm.
Thankfully, unlike other battle royale games, like PlayerUnknown‚Äôs Battlegrounds, where an unlucky circle could leave getting out of the encroaching circle almost impossible, Fortnite‚Äôs map is at least small enough (relative to PUBG‚Äôs) that even if you have to run across the entire island to get to the safety of the randomly centered eye of the storm you run very little risk of being killed by the collapsing border.
On the island are several large and totally unique cities, each with their own style of structures ‚Äî a quaint suburb of houses, a giant office district filled with skyscrapers, or a retail area with an outdoor mall. Each city is full of vibrant colors, and the map as a whole has hundreds of buildings with randomly spawning loot in the form of guns, explosives, and healing items.
Wait, Which Fortnite Is This? Developed by Epic Games, Fortnite was originally conceived as a third-person, co-op, survival game where teams of players could mine resources and build structures to hold off hordes of undead enemies. That version, now a standalone game called Fortnite Save the World, still exists, but it‚Äôs not great. But as the battle royale genre started to gain popularity early in 2017, Epic adapted its survival game‚Äôs basic systems into something new: Fortnite Battle Royale, a separate, free-to-play game that feels like the perfect home for Save the World‚Äôs wayward mechanics.
Fortnite Battle Royale‚Äôs inventory management is, thankfully, simple by design. You get just five slots, so you‚Äôre forced to balance your arsenal of guns with your need for healing or explosives to deal with enemy structures. It‚Äôs a neat limiting factor that forced me to keep a mental shopping list of exactly what I was on the lookout for as I ran across the island, and to resist the urge to pick up anything else. With such specific needs in mind, every chest came with the thrill of hoping it would reveal the weapons I wanted most. Fortnite gives you plenty of ways to mix and match weapons, so even if that chest doesn‚Äôt come up with the exact item you want, you‚Äôll never feel powerless in a fight.
Once you do find the weapons you‚Äôre looking for, most fights in Fortnite go about the same way: You start with one shot from a slow-firing heavy weapon like a sniper rifle or pump shotgun in hopes of ending the fight before it really started, then (if needed) switch over to a faster assault rifle or tactical shotgun to carry out the rest of the battle. While it‚Äôs far from the only way to play, this combination seems to be the preferred method for almost every player and provides the foundation of almost every fight in Fortnite.
It‚Äôs a chaotic and fun system that makes fights a little more complicated.
It‚Äôs a lightning-fast system where fights can end in the blink of an eye with just one slight miss. This makes for a stark contrast from other battle royale games like PlayerUnknown‚Äôs Battlegrounds, which is filled with long, tense standoffs where sustained accuracy often matters more than a single well placed shot. It‚Äôs a chaotic and fun system that makes fights a little more complicated than simply aiming at your opponent and firing, but after a few hours with Fortnite I started to get the shoot-and-switch rhythm down and fights started to become almost automatic.
It‚Äôs the stuff around the shooting that helps Fortnite differentiate itself from every other battle royale game and shows off what truly makes it special: The building.
Carrying over the building system from Save the World is a brilliant choice that sets Battle Royale apart not just from other battle royale games, but most competitive multiplayer games in general. Just about everything that isn‚Äôt the ground can be mined for wood, stone, or steel, which can be used to create walls, stairs, and floors anywhere on the map (so long as some part of the structure touches the ground). It‚Äôs a massive system with so many possibilities that, at first blush, it can be daunting to try to figure out how to build the massive structures that others around you have created. But that‚Äôs one of the best things about Fortnite: It always keeps things simple.
That‚Äôs one of the best things about Fortnite: It always keeps things simple.
With just three primary tiles ‚Äì floors, walls, and stairs ‚Äì the building toolset may seem limited, but it‚Äôs got everything you really need. Whether it was building a staircase up to that hard-to-reach loot chest or quickly laying down an impromptu piece of cover to protect from an attacking enemy, I found I always had the tools I needed for the job at hand, and I could swap to the piece I needed without missing a beat. In fact, that swapping is so easy that one of my favorite moves is placing one platform and jumping off of it, then switch to another type in mid-air and place it before I land. That trick allows you to scale vertical walls or go straight up a mountain. While this may sound like an impressive feat of dexterity, Fortnite makes it so simple that almost anyone can pull it off ‚Äì and they do, making it one of the most common tricks to getting around the island.
The first time I really understood how Fortnite‚Äôs building and shooting played into one another came in the middle of a fight in Retail Row, one of the map‚Äôs many cities. Another player and I were sheepishly taking shots at one another from behind single walls we had built. After I ran out of ammo in my assault rifle, I was forced to turn to my shotgun ‚Äì a weapon I had largely disregarded up until this point. With the few resources I had left, I built stairs over my opponent‚Äôs wall, jumped off, flipped around, and shotgunned him. Looking back, it was as routine a play as it gets, but it was an absolute revelation for me at the time. Suddenly, everything made sense, and I realized that Fortnite Battle Royale is more about building than it is about shooting.
While the little things you can use it for may seem obvious ‚Äì like building stairs to get to the roof of a building, or making a wall to block an enemy‚Äôs shots ‚Äì the system also gives you room to think outside the box. You could build around a downed teammate that you can‚Äôt help yet, or create a decoy fort to lure enemies into an ambush while you wait behind a tree. The system even provides some elegant solutions to getting caught outside the trademark random circles of the battle royale genre: If you find yourself on the wrong side of a lake or chasm, no problem ‚Äì just make your own bridge to the other side.
One player lured me into his elaborate fortress of hallways in hopes of forcing me toward his waiting shotgun at the end of the maze.
Thanks to the building system‚Äôs simple but robust design, you can throw structures together in a way that suits your style.

Overall I have been playing this game from [b] 2018-2019 [/b] and the game itself is very fun but after a while the game gets boring. The main problem in GTA VI are the cheaters and the mk2 oppressor, for example some type flies to you in the mk2 oppressor and starts hitting you with targeting missiles.
I have listed the two most common problems here.
I hope I helped.

26893,game remains too grind intensive for the rewards of endgame items for new players everything is tailored to frustrate the player to by shark cards to even make any progress in the online mode. Recently started playing on pc on a new account was a level 400+ with over 3000+ hours on ps4 in game over 9 years since release. This game is dead do not buy it especially the criminal enterprise packs they are a huge investment into a 9 year old game that no longer deserves your money if you are getting this for any reason get it for the story mode and access too role play servers like FiveM /edit 22 hours in this game is still nearly unplayable in the sense of having fun  solo at lv 1 i still do not recommend for 2022 do not buy this if you have plans to enjoy your first 30 hours. With friends you may have more fun but remember unless you all start new your powerless against them and your broke so have fun with that part no guns or cars

You need very thick skin to play this game online as it's completely unmoderated, and every lobby contains modders with no respect for rules.  And why would they,  when Rockstar allows them to run rampant."
26897,"Yes it's good, but my recommendation is to buy a decently sized sharkcard with the game and buy a business from the start and upgrades. Without these things, it's pretty unbearable. Also u might have to be patient with missions as u cant unlock certain things until your a certain level such as guns and armour."

It's aged quite a bit from the years since I've played it, and Rockstar definitely have not done it any favours just pumping online content and locking you from accessing it via singleplayer unless you have mods, but it's alright.
The horse racing bets, though.
Man...

26987,"I've spent 300 of my 314 hours in online with friends, I know I know ""pay to win"", ""make gta 6"" ""where is my singleplayer dlc"" I get it, but its dumb to not at least accept that they made if nothing else, an addicting game to play with your friends. I loved working my way up and finally getting enough money for the submarine, and the facility, and the arcade. I could easily put 100 more hours into the game. Just don't spend money on shark cards, you are paying the game to play itself bro."
26988,Haven't really played in about 6 years or so on ps4 so figured id grab it while it was on sale. It's come along way from when it first came out for the 360. A lot more things you can do to grind money if you're playing solo like myself. The Cayo Perico was a nice touch on new map area for once. Got hooked quick again.

27002,"This game is CLUTTERED with hackers in every single server. Literally damn near everyone hacks in this game , if you end up in a lobby with just you and another person 9 times out of 10 that guys a ***** hacker. only 2 out of 10 matches consist of people playing legit and even so there begging for a ******* hacker to show up so that they can get some free money. This game is toxic in form on PC I don't recommend it just play it on console specifically PS4/Xbox one , because it's the same ball game on ps3 and xbox 360. And then if you get tired and try and fight back hackers with Mods and ONLY, using it when a hacker is bullying people or trying to mess with you , YOU end up getting suspended or banned, nah **** this game get this sh out of here , by that logic I might as well play black ops 3 multiplayer on PC so I can get aimboted to death by basement dwellers foh. This sh get's 0 stars from me. Mans can't even play a heist correctly when 95% out of the time you'll run into a hacker doing everything for the rest of the team and everyone sits back, Oh and not to mention grinding in a public server oh my god.... I can't stress enough how many times I've been violated by a hacker while bringing cargo back to my bunker or NightClub or etcetera. This game might as well have on the tittle, ""Grand Theft Auto 5 (Hacker Edition)"" . To hell with this sh. What am I supposed to do play in invite only matches wth is even the point of multiplayer than at that point? It's called Multiplayer for a reason it's in the name, to play with other players. I already played with iron man and sh in story mode and a bunch of other single player mods that get boring really quickly I want to play online, specifically. Though not on PC LOL oh f no. Don't buy this sh unless you're gonna' hack , or simply modify the story mode."

27173,"Fun story with plenty to do with mods, the multiplayer is hit or miss depending on if your friends play or not. If you have buds to screw around with, then it'll be a blast. Just remember if you intend to play online, that Rockstar wants you to buy their shitty shark cards in order to purchase any of their cool vehicles. 
Whenever you're not getting blown up by flying bikes, you're getting kicked and crashed by 14 year old children with mod menus they paid $15 for. 

It's become nearly essential for most players to have their own mod menu to defend themselves, if you really intend on joining the multiplayer scene, then I'd totally not recommend looking some up as it really makes the grinding manageable and the greafing nearly non-existent. Just remember to be respectful and that everyone's just trying to enjoy themselves, so there's no point in making the experience worse for others."

Also to be  clear, Online is great, but you have to find ways of getting into Public Lobbies either alone or with friends before it's any fun. The kinds of businesses and missions Online has you going through in the **live lobby full of other people** are too big and people often are stepping over each other and either intentionally or unintentionally griefing each other. That said, GTA Online has always suffered the identity crisis of being their too pvp or too pve, and so they choose to straddle both ahile giving zero fucks about balance and let's be real: it's about selling shark cards, where they've monetized the literal in-game currency, and synthetically inflated the prices of everything. The game is so pay to win it hurts me. 

BUT yeah, if you can get a solo public lobby with friends you're set, and we obvs know mods and single player modes are lit."

Decide to walk to an online mission? Don't worry! a level 50 in a zentorno will absolutely 100mph mach jesus you into another dimension, where you will die, and respawn just to get flattened again.

Want to stand a fighting chance against the level 200 14 year old with every possible armored vehicle in the game? pay for shark cards. rockstar wants your money :)

Grand Theft Auto 5 is the culmination of the series, Rockstar's catalogue and arguably the entirety of AAA video games, which have become bigger and more expensive since the release of Grand Theft Auto 3 over a decade ago. The achievement of Grand Theft Auto 5 is its consistent quality. That's what makes its world feel so believable ‚Äî there's almost nothing that will pull you out of it.

Almost."

27355,"This game has been out since 2015, and it is still the exact same amount of hot garbage, but WITH MORE CONTENT! It's a shit game. The devs are mentally deficient. Don't expect it to work correctly. Don't expect to be able to access even close to half of the ""content"". Don't expect even half of the menu options to function. Fully expect to be raided over and over again by hackers because the devs are dipshits and don't care about their all time best selling game.

This game completely lacks functionality, remotely decent programming, bug fixes, enjoyable game modes, any sort of balance to skill progression, decent rewards for grinding (which takes hours and can easily deny you the, already, worthless rewards). This game not only encourages you to mod and cheat, but punishes you for not doing so. This game is a forgotten vanity project of baby dick republitards that genuinely wish they could blow you up without consequence.

The ONLY reasons this game has positive reviews is nostalgia and a lot of little man-children like playing out their fantasies because the real world has consequences.

But it's GTA and you can do stupid shit, so you're gonna buy it anyway."

27357,"This review is about GTA V Online

I don't even know where to start... While the game has so much potential to provide a good gaming experience it somehow manages to fail at almost every aspect that makes a game enjoyable. 

The COMMUNITY is the WORST i have EVER seen and i've been playing games for over 25 years. There is not a single lobby where there aren't any cheaters/hackers (and yes i purposely call em that). Be it the guy that just uses a mod menu to have fun with the game (those are not healthy for the game but somewhat tolerable) or the guy that teleports across the map to other players, having god mode on and randomly killing anyone they come across just to forcefully exit/crash your game when you give them a hard time doing that. It is ACTUALLY UNPLAYABLE in most public lobbies due to the insane amount of disturbed and sad souls out there. It's just a perfect example of what happens when anyone can have ""power"".
Even if there is no hacker trying way too hard to make your experience the worst, there are still unbelievably many people griefing/randomly killing anyone they come across. And the best part (sarcasm) about all that is that the game entitles you to do that. If someone tries to deliver products to get a little bit of money which they can spend on 1/5 of a car the whole lobby gets a message about what you are doing and that they should kill you and take those products. 
The game tells you to be a toxic person. And since the game is catering to kids at least as much as to adults (lets not forget that this game is rated M = 17+) Rockstar is creating a prototype of gamers that are out of anyone's control.
It is a widely known fact that Rockstar does not listen to their community at all (if you can even call it a community because it contains the word unity). R* has made over 6 billion dollars from this game yet they leave the game in such an unbelievably bad shape, riddled with bugs, no anti cheat precautions, extremely out of touch additions, vehicles and stories, very bad controls, balancing, AI, obsolete features (damn the list doesnt even stop there) that is has nothing to do with what they got known for. This is a game that feels like it is halfway through developement.
They are milking their players with an insane amount of ignorance. And everyone who buys shark cards (ingame money for actual money) is actively supporting what they do.

How did this happen? Well, money! Money is the answer here. The developers take awards, smile at the cameras, bathe in money, ignore those that made them who they are and they are getting away with everything.

SOME PROS would be that it is a pretty decent looking game for such an old game and the driving has improved quite alot, also you definitely can have a good laugh from playing this game. I wish i could add more to this list but it gets tainted by everything bad about it way too much.

Would i recommend this to anyone? Well...no. MAYBE play the single player game if you can pick it up from a sale but if you think you will get that good ol' GTA vibe but with friends this time... be prepared for a hell of a surprise.

Rockstar has lost hundrets of thousands or even millions of potential buyers that liked to play what R* made them who they are, or at least who they were. If you could sell your soul to the devil, be sure they did not only sell their soul, they happily ripped it out of their bodies, took a piss on it, have it go through all circles of hell and laughed maniacally while getting a molten gold injection in their liveless bodies.


EDIT: Oh and please take a look at those reviews. Anyone with a working brain should realize it's mostly children and trolls writing those ""reviews"". Like come on.."

27453,"INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND ITS FUTURE
Introduction

1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries."
27454,"good game

27456,i love the game and it has so much freedom
27457,I dont care about the Story mode its fun. The online is bad its filled with Modders who can crash your game whenever they want. They only way to get rid of them is either by Entering the Story mode then Play on a private session and the other way is to glitch in a solo public session using the task manager
27458,"its a good game but only buy it for the singleplayer, the multiplayer is a pissshit with 40% of the playerbase modding and is not even safe, your ip can get grabbed without a problem and rockstar isnt doing anything about it."

27462,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he created an ""invite only"" game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

27469,"A Good Game Even 9 Years Later its Initial release. Fun To Play With Friends in invite only sessions (not public Sessions) . Still Gets A Lot of Updates from Rockstar Games.

In 2022 I would give this Game a Solid 7.5/10

My Only Complain in this game is that you get bullied by Others Having higher levels while doing missions in GTA online

And For the Story Mode, As it has not received and Kind of expansions like GTA 4 Did (On of The Best Open-world Games with an excellent Story), I would Rate Story Mode a Solid 6/10 as once you get bored of Hackers in GTA online, Story mode is Definitely one good option provided by Rockstar

Criminal Enterprise Pack is Good For Gamers starting in 2022 as it provides some kind Of  economic Stability and I Guess Rockstar Just launched this due to bullying nature of this game in GTA online in first few Hours. I would give  it a solid 9/10 Rating 

Note : Buy This Game only when it is under sale

Total Package Rating 7.5/10"

This is probably the fifth copy of this game that i have bought on pc and 3 copies on console (Your welcome rockstar). 

Story Mode (8/10)

The campaign used to be a 10/10 as it was amazing for the first time but now when i play i personally dont enjoy it as much. I always tend to skip cut-scenes and just try to get through it but at times it can still be really enjoyable. Always choose option c

Online (5/10)

This is a disaster although there have been fewer cheaters as its dead but its still bad when they get in your lobby. You'll ocassionally get that one alright cheater that just helps you with your missions or whatever but then theres the russian ones that put you in cages or spawn kill you and even crash your game beacuse you told them russia sucks. 

Overall (7/10)"

27648,"After playing this game from day 1 on PS3, then on PC, I do not recommend it to anyone, since it's plagued with cheaters, allowed by rockstar who does not give flying f**k about normal honest players. Nobody in randoms to do activities, missions, races or heists. They're all too busy killing each others in normal mode with all the illogical arsenal there is. This game is far from the spirit of GTA.

The more they add, the less I want to play, everything cost millions, and for cheaters it's all okay, but for normal players it's out of reach. I really also do not recommend buying the shark cards from rockstar.

This game really is bad for the online mode. The story mode was never ever updated at all. There is nothing that was added to the solo game in over 6 years, it's cool to do it once, but useless to replay...

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TITLE, unless you like cheaters and get fooled."

27727,"300 hours on the game side of things, Rockstar's version of the game is a cash grab hacker infested toxic pile of hot garbage, now on the FiveM side of things (if you don't know what it is look it up you are missing out) I have over 7000 hours,  So much better and it's the way i recommend playing GTA V online with, but hey if you like getting fisted by hackers or getting banned for being the subject to a money drop or have you internet credentials leaked out to these types of people by all means this is the game for you, back in the day on inital release it was not that bad but now.... that's a whole other story.... The only good part of this rockstar version is the story mode it's amazing my 250+ hours is just the single player alone it's 5* but the most important part is the online and it literaly tanks the whole aspect of the game (since they stopped doing anything for the story side of things and just focused on milking the whales) to make a long story short Play FiveM for the online side of things and enjoy the amazing singleplayer aspect of the game, stay far far away from the online mode."

Especially with the bear community we have lots of riots and shoot outs, People are to harsh on the game... All games are mean't for enjoyment and be creative with. Not for people who just go ewww look at the graphics get over it have fun. 

The biggest downfall to this game when you join a lobby and you have Griefers and Hackers... Because you have people worried about their KD... This why The Bear Community and I make our sessions and have all the laughs in the world."

27860,"While I mostly recommend this game, it is an awful trash game. It's super fun to play. Nothing is the least bit realistic, but the driving is stupid fun. The gun play is absolute garbage, but I love it.


Concerning online play:

It is the most inconsistent pile of trash game I've ever played. In one mission vehicle you press right arrow to make a drop, in the next it's E, next time it's F. You cannot change these keys. And where E is drop in one vehicle, it's Landmines in the next, and car horn in the next. Good luck not hitting the wrong button and dropping a mine under yourself and blowing up, losing all those mission supplies you spent an hour collecting.

Buttons change at random, each mission is slightly different. Sprinting in buildings is slightly faster than walking, but only if in first-person camera. Flying vehicles feel like they are swimming through pudding. Flight sticks are not supported. Boats move so fast they constantly fly out of the water, so then they slow down, then hit a wave and fly out of the water again. Repeat ad naseum.

You cannot set a waypoint during a mission if the leader has set a waypoint. Also if the leader sets a waypoint after you did, it deletes your waypoint.

There are NPCs that call and interrupt your game about every 2-10 minutes. You can hang up, but it overrides your primary fire button till you answer. Also, there is a setting to turn off the calls. It does nothing.

You can pay to win, but there's not much point. Money is pretty easy to come by, and you really just need one garage and like two vehicles to have tons of fun. Not sure why anyone buys the real-money cards just to save a little time, but the game has made crazy amounts of money, so maybe I'm missing something.

The UI to buy most things is in just the worst ""web apps"" in-game. The UI to run each business is completely different between each business, and requires you to use a different laptop inside the business. Also each laptop has a completely different UI? Overall it's kind of like the worst possible UX a game can have...

But it's stupid fun to play (with other friends).

Oh yeah, and hacking is rampant. You constantly run into people who make themselves invulnerable, kill you at the click of a button from across the map, or spawn objects around you to trap you. The players in this game are the worst, since it's all peer-to-peer server model.

You'd think a game that has made literal billions of dollars could fix a few of these issues, but it won't. So just enjoy it for what it is.

Super fun, recommend it, but it's also the worst. I can go on for about 3 more pages with complaints on the inconsistency in this game, if you really want. But also I'll keep playing."

27876,"I used to enjoy making content for this game. That was way back when I had people to play on it with. You are probably wondering on what I'm talking about since you can clearly have only 13 hours of playtime on the game, but that's where the truth gets revealed. I've had this game bought (Not on Steam) for quite some time till now, and I simply bought it on Steam to have easier access to my in-game account. I always wanted to create content for games, and GTA V was one of the first places where I could show how creative I am. Unfortunately, over the years the GTA community seemed to keep on rejecting me and my content, all to the point of where I hardly have any motivation for working on making my content. And that's not everything, based on what I've seen online, it seems that this game is pretty much reached the end for its old players, and I can't say that I'm surprised of that, because I'm not, obviously. I still hop on from time to time (Mostly when there is a new update that I can play through), but other than that, I just don't play this game anymore. And for a fact, I think you shouldn't be playing either. So, if you're looking to play a game, play any game, but not this one though. Because if you play GTA V nowadays, you'll simply be wasting your time on a shot game."

Obviously it isn't 10/10, but online, at least to me, doesn't exist anymore, unless you count FiveM. for me, this game is a great way to waste time, because of the plot of story mode.

I enjoy the online part of the game but I wish it was cross platform so that my viewers who have like a PlayStation and Xbox could play with me. Most of my friends don't have a PC and I don't have a console that will let me play Gta  but other than that I can't wait for gta 6 to come out.

27936,"Ehhh. You need money to make money, no problem there. But you need more and more money for fun too. If you want X you need to buy Y, but if you want X+ you need to buy upgrades for X, etc. etc. Unless you have a group to do Cayo Perico with you, it's dumb.

Also, modders either make or break a session. If they aren't there, then that's good. If they are there, hope that they are cool (potentially they even give you money lol). If they are there and they aren't cool they can literally end the game and cause the application to crash. Cool."

27974,"About Grand Theft Auto 5:


Originally launched in 2013, Rockstar Games' decidedly adult-oriented GRAND THEFT AUTO V has been remastered for newer consoles, including PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. The story mode puts players in the shoes of a trio of criminals in Los Santos, a fictionalized version of Los Angeles. One protagonist is middle-aged and begins the game as a recently retired criminal; another is unpredictable, cruel, and dependent on drugs; and the third is a young man just beginning his life of crime. Players have the ability to switch freely among these men as they work through a dramatic criminal saga set in an open world that sees them carrying out heists, stealing cars, taking revenge on rivals, and killing anyone who gets in their way, including police officers and innocent civilians. The popular multiplayer mode GTA Online, meanwhile, allows players to create a unique avatar before setting out on a freeform criminal career with activities ranging from bank robberies and car theft to assassinations and shooting down airplanes, in addition to more traditional adversarial multiplayer modes such as deathmatch and capture the flag. The 2022 remastered edition sports enhanced graphics -- including support for HDR, ray tracing, 4K resolution, and 60 frames-per-second refresh speeds -- as well as a Career Builder mode for GTA Online that lets first-time players begin with millions of dollars to help them buy properties and gear so that they can catch up to longtime GTA players who have the ability to transfer over their characters from older platforms.

My Personal Recommendation:

This isn't a game for kids. Beyond its glamorized depiction of crime, greed, and violence, Grand Theft Auto V is filled with mature satire both obvious and nuanced -- some of which hasn't aged very well -- that younger audiences are bound to take at face value. That said, it's also an expertly designed game that remains surprisingly playable and engaging. It gives players a vibrant and authentic world bursting with activities and things to discover, tight controls that seamlessly transition between various actions, and a cleverly designed story that puts the player in the shoes of three separate characters, pushing each narrative forward at its own pace. Newly added features in remastered versions of the game -- ranging from vastly improved loading times and enhanced audio to subtle new haptic feedback and contextual trigger sensitivity when using the PlayStation 5 controller -- have helped this game remain relevant and widely played much longer than most.
GTA Online is bound to be where most folks spend the bulk of their time, though. Newer editions allow players to skip the opening part of the story mode altogether -- which was required in earlier editions in order to teach people how to play -- and jump straight into Rockstar's multiplayer universe, where almost nothing's scripted and pretty much anything goes. What's more, the new Career Builder gives players $4 million up front and lets them set themselves up as a gun runner, the operator of a shady nightclub, a corrupt CEO, or a bike gang leader. GTA Online provides endless opportunity for players to indulge dark criminal fantasies while testing their mettle against other players. Just keep in mind, though, that just about everything here -- online and off -- is geared for adult audiences. And even then it won't be to all tastes. Grand Theft Auto V is well made and entertaining, but unequivocally inappropriate for kids."

28074,"y'kno what, that game is from 2013. Since then it was remastered, re-issued, re-made a couple times. Down to important stuff:

Story from 2013 is a time-accurate satire, in the best tradition of Rockstar Games. Game mechanics have been made more comfortable for a rather easy-going gamer than it was back in 2008 with GTA IV but whatever, still a nice game to play and a hilarious set of figures to laugh at.

Online from 201X-2022 and going is a meta-joke of Rockstar Games. They have placed themselves into GTA universe and are now laughing about their own values and corporate strategy. Tired of a game that is older than your kid? Try GTA Online, it's got players that are younger than that and will whack that bit of fun you were having with some flying bike you were unable to counter financially. Because like in the real life, you can enjoy it more if you have more of some fictional units of value at your expense. Go get yourself a flying bike, a flying car, a VTOL jet, a hangar, an office, a VTOL fortress, a truck full of tech to store the flying bike, a nightclub to store the aforementioned truck, a bunch of businesses to actually finance the nightclub, yadda yadda. Have fun. Because it's the only return you're gonna enjoy from GTAO. Payouts for online activities are miserable so you are stuck repeating the same old grind you've been doing for a year in order to achieve anything enjoyable in an online game that hat enjoyment and fun as it's primary goal.

The soundtrack is a masterpiece. Brings me memories of the last decade. Makes me feel young again. As anything else that makes me feel young, I only paid for it once and never again.

Absolutely recommend."

28096,"Awww Shit! Here we go again.... Back to the big city of Los Santos with three main protagonists to take care of loose ends of their personal problems. There's loads of interesting cars to steal, Easter eggs to hunt, and the humor of this game is top notch. I would like to give this game a 9.5 but I have problems with this game that it didn't sit well with me. The money that you earn in the game has a certain limit of what you can get from the main story. After you beat the game, there are no missions that you can keep on earning in the millions. Because the rest of the cash you can get are only in the multiplayer version so can afford everything else that you want to achieve.

28114,"Im going to give an honest review from both sides of GTA V being that Ive played on PC and Console. 

For story mode, its a classic that will never get old. And if you do get bored of the base game, you can get some mods like Chaos mod or Rainbomizer and make it really interesting and a lot harder. I have learned a lot of cool glitches to use in the base game. For the base game i would give it a solid 9/10.

Time to talk about the elephant in the room. GTA Online. Ive put hundreds of hours on console and experienced a really fun time with the LFG feature on Xbox. On console there is so much more stuff you can do and you can make friends SO much easier than on PC. But this review is for PC! Now i hate to say it but PC GTA Online sucks. It genuinely does. Ive now put about 140 hours into online alone and starting the grind is the worst part. If for some reason in 2022 you dont have the criminal enterprise pack, youre in for a hell of a ride. The only thing i would reccomend is getting some friends (i know its hard but trust me), i would say about 3 or 4 would do the trick, and grind together until you get enough to buy the Kosatka for $2.2M. 
Thats just the tip of the ice berg though. Please do remember that there are ways to bring cheats into online. Modders and Godmode players run rampant and the ""servers"" are p2p. Yikes. A modder can crash your game if they truely feel like they want to get rid of you and never come back. 
The game has a lot going for it, but rockstar is never going to truely make the game good again unless they fix the problems with the game. Yes, you can have the best experience, but the bleak truth is that Rockstar has given up on this game.
Overall: 7/10
Story: 9/10
Online 4/10"

28203,"literally dont buy this grindy piece of shit game, maybe do for the story but dont even bother playing online, its just a piece of corporate greed masked as a good multiplayer experience"
28204,i like this game a lot
28205,"The single player is really good, but lets be honest, you're not here for the single player. If you're going to play online, then don't waste your time with public lobbies. Find a few buddies and start an invite only lobby for you to enjoy. The public lobbies are filled with griefers on oppressers and hackers who spam you with scam messages. If you're coming over from a console, then don't bother. Restarting from scratch is much harder than you remember the grid being in the first place. I really wouldn't mind the fact that you couldn't transfer your character if Rockstar's reason wasn't so blatantly false. They say its to stop all the hacked accounts from transferring over from console, but they don't care at all about the hackers in this version of the game. I used to believe that Rockstar was one of the good developers that cared about the consumer experience, but seeing the way the treat Read Dead 2 online and the state of the public servers in this game has changed my mind. Rockstar is one buggy mess of a launch away from being CD Project Red. I hope that doesn't happen..."

28213,play with friends without emm its boring
28214,"its so garbage with all the hackers and tryhards in this game, not even fun anymore. also rockstar is too busy milking gta 5 instead of making gta 6
"
28215,best game evvah!
28216,"Got depressed because the economy is shit
 
Rockstar could be doing more and offering things for a lesser cost.(Who tf would buy a Plane that does nothing special but looks gold for 10 million  when I can get the exact fucking plane for for 1.5 million)

Oh and the modders, you'd lose your mind once you bump into these guys once or twice 

I personally am a car guy in this game. I'd love to own those expensive supercars that are worth 2-5 million but every single money making method is locked behind a PAY WALL

This game needs some serious remodelling 

3 months after a big update, the game is drier than Africa


Other than that, you can buy the game just to experience the story mode and maybe snoop around and some heists with friends."

28273,"Honestly, I wasn't a huge fan of GTA V when I first picked up the game 2 years ago for the PS4. The story was mid and GTA Online was genuinely more boring than Fallout: 76. That was until I picked up the game on sale a few days ago for my PC. Good. God. This game is incredible. GTA V is still very okay, but GTA Online is genuinely one of the games I've had the most fun in in years. I'm genuinely impressed with the game. I love doing heists and playing with my friends doing missions and causing chaos in the streets. Definitely a solid 8/10 for this game, only because the real star here is GTA Online, not V itself."

imagine a world where you could do anything - except you can't because everything is so needlessly limited
there's so much wrong with this game, I don't even know where to start, it's the opposite of quality-of-life, it's an awful port of the 2013 console game and it has never gotten any no-brainer features that one would expect to have from the start
even the monetization model is insane because it's so ridiculously overpriced
also don't get deceived by people's playing time, because even on SSDs you spend 2/3 of that on loading screens

flying planes is pretty fun though, and maybe you like playing the story but other than that it's such a bad game, it blows my mind how people can enjoy it for more than and hour"

28328,"first played in 2015, 2k+ hrs on this game, the good single player gets massively overshadowed by the pile of doodoo feces that is multiplayer, maybe worse than Cyberpunk at launch. modders godmode griefing, spam spawning explosions on everyone, and lots more including crashing your game 'cause their parents gave up on them, plenty of bots spamming too, the only modders they went after were moneydroppers that helped people; Saints Row-level ridiculously unbalanced game design, awful grinding and mission design, years of wonky mechanics they're never gonna fix or balance; all they wanna do is sell Shark Cards, GTA+ w/ some crap benefits and P2W vehicles; their most credible developers are leaving and it's getting worse and worse"
28329,"The online mode is full of griefers and hackers, you'll get blown up every five minutes unless you have a high level friend to carry you, but at that point the missions will either be trivial and boring for them or near impossible without being carried for you. The story is absolute shit with characters who are entirely unlikeable. Before you say ""Oh, that's the point, there'yre supposed to be bad guys"" I just have to ask why you'd be playing an asshole in a video game, normal people don't want to be assholes. The offline mode also has lots of side content, like drinking, watching TV, getting high, going to a strip club, or riding a faris wheel, but these are all horribly mundane things that you're better off just doing for real using the money you would have spent on this game."
28330,"It's a good game. Came out when I was 12. Now I'm almost 22 and still no GTA VI. Get on it, Rockstar."

Every server at all times has at least one person hacking at all times or hell they can turn GOD mode on and off on a whim and it is VERY OBVIOUS they don't hide it. So if you plan to play online you can easily obtain ways to hack it...Rockstar doesn't seem to care at all so DO NOT BUY their dumb cards. Just hack, they pretty much hand you the keys to the kingdom with no punishment.  If you buy it for story mode then sure, its okayish."

28456,"The main game is amazing , its worth buying for it alone. The multiplayer is pretty mixed. It has an insane amount of content, but the matchmaking takes an insane amount of time, and its really hard to coordinate with randoms. You can technically solo  lots of the missions, but that kind of ruins the purpose of the multiplayer, and many missions are not made to be completed solo. Also, it really sucks when some guy with a laser tank starts griefing you."
28457,amazing
28458,good
28459,i got banned instantly on this game becvuase i cheated but it was stupib becuase i barely cheated and it was only like 1.5 billion dollars. dont know why i got banned.

28466,"Online continues to become a dumpster fire. Modding and exploiting is continuing to get worse and more frequent, with servers on the weekend threatening to become unplayable. Exploiters can force all players into one space, lock everybody into cutscenes, spawn endless explosions on players, make themselves invulnerable, set their names to other players' to imitate them, and generally harass, harangue, and ruin entire servers' gameplay with mere seconds of effort. Moderation is seemingly nonexistent despite the frequent updates to the game and a GTAO+ subscription."

28575,"Best game. Just too many annoying hackers, they make the game glitch"
28576,"Good
"
28577,"Single Player is borderline perfect.
Multiplayer is a scum filled cum pool, which Rockstar milks to death.

Also don't forget them completely disregarding how broken their security is.
Cheaters will easily get your IPV4 and Rockstar ID with mod menus, so if you wanna torture yourself with that repetitious mess use a VPN."
28578,good
28579,"Rather play on PS4 or Xbox. Too many braindead modders and hackers on the PC with godmode and shit. People spamming hacks and shit in chat the whole game. Get spam notifications for hours on the ingame phone thats PING PING PING PING PING PING PING the whole time. You get teleported and all bullshit all over the map by these braindead modder children until your game crashes. People have zero skill in game...game doesn't take any skill, just money. More money you can glitch, the ""better"" you are. Almost impossible too have any fun on the PC on this game if you are new, because Rockstar have no fucking control over hackers and shit like that. If you are too lazy too work for what you have and just want to hack your way to get what you want...this game is for you. Have fun"

1) Buy the heist locations
2) Start the set ups
3)Wait for players
4)Wait for players
5)Wait for players
6)Someone joins but leaves
7)Wait for players
8)Finally got whole squad
9) pilot leaves after one death
10) finish the heist
11) Lester takes 99% for shitting in his wheelchair
12) Get banned for no reason."
28762,"I have always loved gta, even when it was top-down. BUT-- I cant seem to go more than a couple weeks or months at the best without the rockstar launcher messing up. Be warned, you are likely wasting your money. Also, the people in the online version are pretty rude, and cheating happens constantly. I recommend saints row for the same experience, if you buy this game youre just paying a lot of money for a title. San Andreas was also better than V. Note that ive played the story mode for 200 hrs for gta V. Im not talking out of my butt"
28763,I don't really like it but it didn't let me play I exited out of it and I press stop and I press start but it says Game is already running try to connect to stream game support
28764,"its so fun, i played story mode on my ps4, more than 2000 hours would rly recomend"
28765,does not work
28766,"pretty fun and cool that you can drive and like shoot you know you can, throw people out of there car and thats pretty fun"

28898,"As a person who has lots of sex all the time, I can say that this game is 100% accurate to having sex with sexy women. Like I do. everyday. This game did not make me horny however. I am not gay. I just have too much sex with real women to spend more than 15 minutes in this game. On the other hand I would recommend this game to people who do not have sex (unlike me because i have lots of sex with women a lot) as there are naked women in it and they are naked. One kinda looks like one of my many girlfriends who I have sex with a lot. I have lots of sex. I also am very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because I am very muscular and handsome and very good at video games. All my girlfriends say Im very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome. One of my girlfriends asked me to have sex with her but I told her I was playing a sex game instead so she started crying and became a lesbian and killed herself because I did not have sex with her. I have sex with women. Not men. I am not gay. I am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because I am very cool and sexy. My penis is very big. All my girlfriends like my penis because it is very big and I am very good at sex with my women. Every woman Ive had sex with is very sexy and so am I. I have lots of sex. I am also very handsome and sexy and I have lots of sex."

Got 20 gems right down there in my hand

28951,"Extremely sub-par.
The Online is a perpetual security threat, and the single player is only enjoyable once.

What is good, however, is it created FiveM, which is a statistically superior form of GTA Multiplayer - play that, not this."

My friend got an addiction to the shoe store as well as other, ""stuff"" Don't play this game if either you have an additive personality or your toxic. Although this game doesn't include a KFC or a McDonald's it has things like those but I don't accept them. I'd much prefer if they had the original ones. This game is alright I'd play it again"

28989,"very good game, lots of campaign and online, its just in another ballgame. it may seem hard at first but when you get to the end of the game and start playing online youll love it. but i do believe that there should be more things to do in campaign other than plain old missions, stores which dont work like online, and having nothing to buy."

so if we say Gameplay wise it is 10/10 then Hackers and lack of any support and some long load times when rockstar lags is 1/10 that means summed up rating is like 6/10 which is not good still i managed to enjoy it in solo or semi solo sessions since hackers are very annoying on 30 ppl sessions."

29054,"This game feeds the beast inside. I can feel myself becoming more like the Joker every day (Joaquin Phoenix).
When I first booted up the game, I was going the speed limit. But that wasn't CRAZY enough *joker laughs*.
It didn't take long for me to become my GTA character in real life!
As soon as I went to storm a local military base in real life. It was like I had 5 stars irl. 
All of a sudden some guy in swim shorts just.. appears out of nowhere. That's not even the craziest part.
It was like all the bullets deflected off his bare skin. Lo and behold, he begins floating. Craziest thing I've ever seen (and im like an irl Joaquin Phoenix Joker).
All of a sudden his attention is on me. Unphased, he tells me my IP address and home address before disappearing.
I'm scared to go outside."

29131,GTA 5 is a very fun! It's like real life but you can do tones of stuff you can't do in real life and this is why I enjoy it very much. However GTA 5 has a lot of hacker and ban things such as money drops but not hacks that kick you out of the game. I just hate how in my opinion 1/3 lobbies will have a hacker.

29140,"GTA is one of the more popular games out there, I've got it pretty recently and I've enjoyed it quite a bit. It's definitely not a beginner friendly game, in online mode there are alot of high levels who will just shoot you but I've gotten used to it. The Story mode on offline is fun too, I like how each character has different missions and the aspect of robbing stuff."

rockstar is like this kid, he can make good games BUT he ruins the online game by allowing cheats and literally made an option named kick player to free himself from ''baning cheaters'' responsibility.


good day

imma do an update:
Looks like rockstar is banning innocent people,idk if they are telling the truth cuz they say the never modded nor used cheats.if thats true,,,we MUST not buy anymore games from it.
I personally dont use cheats nor mods, i hate them.
there might be a time i get ban for no reason.
im just gonna play my game cuz I already bought it. BUT NEVER GONNA PAY ANYMORE MONEY FOR ROCK* GAMES.

ITS your choice to be in side with evil or good.

My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

29299,"Played this game since day one on PS3. Back then it was an amazing game, really, and if you're into single player game you really should get it on any platform you can.

But now the multiplayer has become something terrible, it's just a game of farming the same thing in loop, or a game of spending thousands into the game to get the new contents. Because there is none to the single player, everything is on the multiplayer. And because everything is just so much expensive there, sharkcards just seems worthless at some point.

And the content added isn't what I think would be great for the game, but of course that's up to everyone's perspective, but the fact it's way too expensive to be enjoyable is terrible.

I understand that for the game to keep working, they need to make money, but it seems that even if you decide to spend money to be able to have fun in the game, that money will be spent in a snap of fingers. I swear this game is Thanos when it comes to mons.

Please purchase the game if you're into single player because the story is great, but please note it's got no new content for single player, and that multiplayer is barely enjoyable without farming money or playing in private session. (Unless you're into PvP everywhere, with people that have way better weapon than you such as orbital strike, and that if you engage in fight, you'll lose ammo, armor that you spent money on, money that you farmed, etc.)

NOW! There is a solution for multiplayer that is FiveM, it has tons of game mods and some servers doesn't have problems with mons. So that would be your only way to get away with it."
29300,"As much as this game should probably get negative feedback now as time goes on and not much content or any fun content in exact is added.. and no new game to continue this series, it still was one of the greatest games ever made, its just dead now so ima wait for the next one to hopefully impress me more than this one did back in 2013.."

Since then, it has gone extremely stale and the addition of the abominable flying rocket bike, along with various other unnecessarily overpowered vehicles, might have just killed the online experience as we know it. Single player still holds up well. However, online is just a lost cause and Rockstar really should just put all hands on deck for GTA VI, rather than keeping this broken mess on life support. And let's be honest, a lot of the people that still play this game are just waiting for GTA VI to come out."

Now hackers can block reports so there's no reason to do that now either. and thanks to the multiple free giveaways for the game these guys can drop an account and get another no problem if they do get hit with a ban hammer.

29493,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy

His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.

The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.

A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.

The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.

However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.

Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.

It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.

In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.

Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.

When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.

Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.

Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.

If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.

For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.

For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.

They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider‚Äôs landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.

The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.

A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted

A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.

This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.

The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.

A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower."

29509,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

29615,It's a very good game.
29616,"ok
"
29617,"Singleplayer (storymode) is phenomenal, but the multiplayer (GTA Online) has gone out of hands, because of oppressors, modders and a ton of glitches and bugs. Games at least 7 years old and still we see out of hand cheating issue, crashing other players with socket pockets (overwhelming other player's video card, until his/her game crashes). Oh, and the most ironic part is the advertising/spamming of cheats or what ever these bots are advertising/spamming in public session chat and text messages. R* anti-cheat system is a joke. Period."
29618,This is one of my favrite game
29619,"good game
"
29620,"Things you can do in GTA Online:
-Drive around with homies
-Get put in a cage indefinitely
-Have your address posted in the live server chat
-Get your fastest car, only to have someone who we can presume is god, teleport on your trunk while you approach mach speeds, he will then unload a clip of mini nuclear warheads into your cranium
-get hit by a missile from the stratosphere that came from a flying dirtbike
-Get voluntold to enter a players house, that is also your house! immediately exit the house, and see the entire server, also leaving your front door!

Protip: 
If someone does any of these things, and you wish for them to leave, please copy and paste this message, they will immediately exit the game:

10/5 stars, tremendous game, just remember, if you wanna be rich, dont be poor!"

29622,This game is fun you get to explore in diffrent cars do diffrent robberys and has great graphics! I recommend you try gta 5 !
29623,good
29624,"fun sometimes,"
29625,car go fast in game i like
29626,"this is definitely a game
"
29627,"GTA online has become so broken its unplayable. There's hackers everywhere, they'll teleport you at will, grief you endlessly, one of them even seemed to crash everyone in the session's game. Rockstar does not care at all, all they want is people to keep buying shark cards"
29628,"Good game to many modders
"
29629,"It is gooddddddddddddddddddddddddd
"
29630,gg
29631,"very nice game,but cant open the now....."
29632,"It's a very nice game where you can either follow the rules (lmao) or do whatever you want, the online game mode is confusing to use but it's worth it to watch a 16-minute video. ill simply this for children: gun gun pew pew good game"
29633,Great game to spend time with friends! Love the gameplay!

29643,This game is an interactive documentary of what it's like to like in California.
29644,this game server is sucks. everytime server problem. waste of money
29645,"FUN FUN FUN
"
29646,"This game is a joke. Rockstar does absolutely nothing to stop modders in this game and fix basic bugs that have plagued the game for years. They seem to only fix money glitches, no surprise there. Heist and missions regularly glitch and break, and sometimes it seems intentional. Probably to get you to buy shark cards. The funny thing is, if you want people to spend money on your game, they need to be happy.  Getting constantly blown up by a modder and getting crashed is not something that will make happy customers. There are so many illegitimate ways to get money such as websites selling accounts to modders taking you on glitched heists it's legitimately funny how dumb Rockstar is to think people will buy their overpriced shark cards. As for modders, they actually have more control over the game than Rockstar does. They can see your ip address, glitch you out, destroy your cargo etc and you can't do anything about it. This game has literally no anticheat. I'd like to congratulate Rockstar on creating an online experience that's best enjoyed in a glitched solo private lobby. No wonder so many people play FiveM. At least they give a crap about their players and creating a genuinely fun experience. Just today I spent an hour rebooting my game to do a heist because modders kept crashing my game. Once I could get in a good lobby the heist broke twice and required more rebooting. GG's Rockstar."
29647,cool
29648,Great way to repeatedly run your boss over without getting fired....

"
29673,"GTA needs no introduction, and GTA Online makes a very decent job of keeping things fresh by releasing free DLCs every once in a while. It's true, they are milking the hell out of this game by now, but it's definitely worth the buy for fans of the genre."
29674,strippers
29675,So good.
29676,yes goood game
29677,"This an amazing game after 9 years, and counting. Would recommend it, online is still an interesting place."
29678,good game est year 7. been playin before u posers satfu
29679,"story's good enough but IV's better. GTA V Online's horrible, both in pc & on consoles. It used to be great back in the day, then R* decided to introduce flying cars and futuristic stuff that nobody liked. Oh and I forgot to mention that recently they also released an ""enhanced and expanded"" edition in next-gen consoles with 2 separated packs, a single player pack and online pack. And guess what, if you buy the single player pack, it won't let you launch the game, because the Online pack is required and is mandatory (also sold separately), so basically a whole scam. This is why this game doesn't deserve to be recommended. If you want a great story you shold play GTA IV."

29716,"this has been one of my favourite games since before i was even nearly old enough to play it. i have around 3000 hours playtime on my Xbox so, when i got a PC this was the first game i bought.For new players this can be an amazing game if you have friends willing to help you,if you dont, the game is painful to play and is filled with modders. so basically if you dont already have friends who play the game or you dont really know what your doing. i wouldn't recommend. if you do have friends then i would reccomend it"
29717,"this is the best game that i have ever played in online. i started this game like 2 years ago and its not that hard, u can have some fun with your friends (if u have real friends) and yea thats it thx :) (i need help)"

29757,i like the game becouse its realistic and you can do what ever you lik
29758,"GTA 5 may not have the best community and if you're playing online you should most likely go in a solo session but GTA 5 is one of the most fun video games out there whether you're playing through the main campaign or playing GTA online it takes a while to get burnt out of. In GTA online building up an MC or organization from nothing and getting huge amounts of income from it is one of the most satisfying things you can do period. While in the campaign the story is intriguing and not just filler that makes things make sense,  i won't go into detail as not to spoil it but it is interesting. And the actual gameplay is amazing. And finally the car chases. You can't name a game after stealing cars and not include car chases so of course GTA delivers. The car chases can be at breakneck speeds or a snail's pace and they are always jampacked with explosions, head-on collisons , and car pile ups. With the added feature of shooting from the window you can also sacrifice most likely not crashing for the ability to shoot the driver out of the car ramming you off the road or chuck a grenade at it. The tires can also be shot out and make the car chasing you lose stability but they can also do the same to you. In general the car chases are fun and action packed. So most people that don't think violent video games are bad, GTA 5 is an amazing game most people will enjoy."
29759,"Great game, I love almost every aspect there is to it.
Fun, interesting, kinda hard, u have tons of things to do, playability is hella great; all this game is good actually
Only throwback would be that there's a shit ton of cheaters, n well that kinda ruins the fun when it comes to a lot of aspects of the game"

29775,"[h1]I'm not 12 anymore...[/h1]
[hr][/hr]
I was gonna write a long paragraph about stupid characters, story, driving and so on, but I already wasted enough of my time on this game. My feelings in a nutshell:
I spent like [b]200$[/b] on a guitar and accessories, having zero knowledge about the instrument.
I also spent [b]15$[/b] on this game, having some clues what I'm about to experience.
[u]Believe it or not I regret paying those 15$.[/u]"
29776,"I'm only recommending this, BECAUSE, the Single Player story is dynamic, even if it had a rocky start because of the introduction of Trevor's character when he's in the state of San Andreas. Let's be clear: Johnny Klebitz deserved better and was probably best suited to be written off properly than just being offed by Trevor just like that.

As for GTA Online? Well... Simple. DO NOT PLAY IT if you don't want to be griefed, modded on, and get yourself banned from at any session at any way possible. It will make your life hellish, and it's best you avoid it altogether. Rockstar and TakeTwo NEVER fixed the GTA Online modder epidemic and it sucks BAD for immersion-looking players. Not a good multiplayer product. It's best you check out other means of playing multiplayer games like Roleplay servers or Activity servers like those in FiveM. If you want to enjoy this game, give both this game credit, but also give this game credit for its dynamic content being used in other servers rather than GTA Online. The vanilla online content wouldn't change much, but you WILL lose patience with the hackers and illegal modders.

Other than anything ""GTA Online"", this is a big recommended game. This contains the continuation of GTA IV's story. Hopefully, the next installment will be twice as better as this one."

Cheaters run as rampant as I have ever seen in any video game ever. This is pretty much a containment game for the scum of the internet and you should not afflict yourself with it if you can help it.

29808,"It‚Äôs map and the detail put into this game is outstanding. You get a very big map with fully accessible shops (a couple on each block). There‚Äôs so much you can do and explore. The storyline is good, but I prefer GTA: Online. You do mission with other people and can have fun with your friends. 

GTA Online on the other hand is better, in my opinion. You can do missions with other people or your friends, race with them, troll with them, really do anything with them. All while you can build an empire. The detail and the graphics are excellent, but even civilians talk and there‚Äôs a lot to interact with. Although you have been warned, the hackers are a tiny TINY problem."
29809,"mama mo
"
29810,"The game itself is great. The story is wonderful. The problem comes from online. It is impossible to play the game and avoid modders. You have the option to play in a private session but you can't cause they will use a mod menu, break into your private session, kill you, and crash your game. Rockstar doesn't care either. They say they take modding and hackers seriously but it's clear they don't or the problem wouldn't be so rampant. Every night it's the same shit. Rockstar could easily fix their security problems if they just spent the money everyone knows they have to do so. Don't play this game unless you have a very high bullshit tolerance or just stick to playing the first week after a new major update or ban wave. It's the only way to enjoy it."

29814,"I'll finally change my thumbs down back into a thumbs up. Only because of the fact they made it to where you can do pretty much everything in a public lobby, in a private/invite only lobby now.

I can run my guns, run my business, and work on things with friends without having a kid come out of no where, spawn above me, and then rain story mode NPCs riding scooters and flipping me off down upon me till the 500th NPC causes my game to crash, or they just crash me.

So for now GTA has earned its thumbs up back. Least till another kid hacks his way into my invite only session again just to crash all of us again. Seriously rockstar, fix your security and anti-cheat system. Got kids running around with god mode and sh*t everywhere these days."

29935,"[h1]GTA5[/h1] GTA5 has been one of my top games in the past 10 years, and if i'm still playing it today, then damn its a pretty good game! Sure it has its ups and downs but this is GTA5. You gotta understand that this is a savage game all about money to get vehicles and upgrade them so you can do more missions to get more money, to get more/better vehicles. But GTA5 has been pretty consistent at adding content. Personally I enjoy the multi player coop experience or even just free roam. There are so many things to do in this game today I cant even list them out.
