11,good game
12,"It’s a fun game filled with charm, love, and humour that everyone can enjoy.

The combat is simple but engaging, the game has tons of replayability and a multitude of different characters, animal companions and unlocks to get, and it’s a fun game to play whether you’re by yourself or playing with others.

The art style is beautiful and the music is fantastic, the story is the only department where I wish they had expanded it just a bit more, but I get why they didn’t because at its core, this is a beat’em up arcade game and I mean that in a good way.

This version is also updated to support 60fps framerates, better visuals and I believe, even better performance, it also plays great with a keyboard and mouse.

Totally recommend it.

13,not poopy
14,killed my friend lol!!!!!!!!!!!!! he got absolutely got trolled lmao!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
15,For the time it's been out and the hours spent on console. This game is still great! If this game remains on the steam store forever it will be a game that can stand the test of time itself. If you haven't already. Buy this game. The Behemoth has deserved my money and my respect.

36,"very good first time experience, even better subsequent experiences, but remember t take breaks before beating the story for the 5th time in a week

what i dont like is that some levels are bumfuck easy because theyre so short, and then theres shit like lava world that has 2 bosses at the very end and no checkpoints or anything like that in between

anyway really fun and i recommend if you have friends that you love to torture :D"

45,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

107,In my top 3 of all time anyday
108,yesgsaga
109,"Now this game is a classic, if you weren't playing this game on your 360 with randos just trying to get past lava world, what were you even doing? For real though, this game is a need-to-play to add on the list. A fun little hand drawn beat-em-up experience with a lot of fun jokes and enemy types. The only real complaints are that the game is really short and that there are some very stark difficulty ramps randomly, but otherwise I think it's a 10/10. Just sit back and have a casual little session of brutally decapitating barbarians and ripping through the various kingdoms"
110,"10 years on and still a classic, one of my favourite games"
111,Best game ever made 10/10
112,"I probably had 100 hours on this on my xbox in high school, at the very least. I unlocked almost all of the characters and had countless play-throughs. This game is 100x more fun with friends. Very addictive and achievement-based by trying to collect and unlock all weapons, pets, and knights. Exploring the various abilities is fun. Very simple game-play and mechanics so I would play this as a great way to connect with kids in my family that are mature enough to handle the cartoon-y blood. So this game would be especially fun for parents with their kids, but it's still fun as an adult as well."
113,best game of all time

It has everything that people love in a game: A great story line, great graphics, great creators, it's long so you don't beat it within five seconds, and once you finish you still have things you can do. I got this as a gift and it was great."
128,gud
129,You really have to hold tight to quality cooperative games like this one. Because there aren't enough.
130,good
131,"very highly recommended
poured lots of time into this game, the story mode is a must-have experience and is made 10x greater if experienced with friends

pretty high skill ceiling, lots of combos to memorize & also a tactic, ''juggling"", where you stunlock enemies
the boss fights are amazing, especially in insane mode where even a small mistake can get you killed

tons of replayability, 31 different characters to unlock & level up & a very big storyline with plenty of levels
""insane"" difficulty that makes the already amazing story mode much harder and even more fun to beat once again

pvp, as fun as it may seem, is completely broken as someone with red knight can just kill you with 1 spell & isn't that fun

unfortunately not as popular anymore & no new updates will come out, but this game isn't buggy at all and is totally still worth getting.
once again, highly recommended with friends"
132,This game is timeless and brilliant. It deserves a sequel.

100/10"

166,I keep coming back I genuinely love this game so much
167,mmmmm
168,this game is goated
169,"What can I say that hasn't already been said on this masterpiece. Castle Crashers inspired a generation of video game developers with it's phenomenal replay-ability, co-op high jinks, and humor. The game can be crude at times, but always with the best intentions. This game has stood the test of time, and then some. One of the best games ever created, and made by a small team at that. The polish will easily make you forget that this is an indie title."
170,7 / 10

179,"Good Game! been playing this game since the Xbox days and its still an amazing game!

ilysm Behemoth x <3"
180,seriously legit
181,This game is nice
182,"Fun game to pick up and play by yourself or with friends. The side modes aren't too bad, and they bring extra replay-ability to the game. The story is quick and to the point in terms of cutscenes and isn't hung up with dialogue, but rather actions and expressions from characters, a style, I found to be a bit clever and it makes the scenes have more humor. Combat is a bit more advanced than what it initially may seem, though - pointing this games most colossal flaw - it can get, really, REALLY repetitive as most combat can boil into button-mashing screens of enemies to death, with slight variation, especially if you choose to melee all your foes. Other than that I recommend it as a great single/multiplayer game to play through at least once."
183,its good
184,fun
185,bbb

207,"I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game with my 7yo.
It is 100% worth picking up if you find it on a Steam sale."
208,e
209,You play it once you leave it forever
210,"This game really washed me away with its graphics and details, I think if they had updated this game enough it could have been a really good game. We're talking about a 2015 game that is still pretty relevant in 2022. I think if you wanna have fun with your friends you should play this. Also it is very nostalgic."
211,still have no clue as to why this game didnt win 'game of the year' award for 2012
212,BUY THIS FUCKING GAME ASAP
213,"Its a really good beat em' up style game. I really recommend it if you're bored and have a spare 15 dollars. Theres hours of gameplay and its so addicted you can just zone out while playing it for hours..... Very well made game, and the graphics arent exactly stunning, but its cute."
214,favorite game
215,Castles are in fact crashed. 10/10.
216,FUN
217,I love this game. This is how you make a arcade beat em up. I love the animation. style. and game play. All we need now is a sequel or something similar but better. Come on Behemoth!!!!!!!!!! We need another.  This game is great with 4 players. I recommend this game. I give it a 5 out of 5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
218,"A true co-op classic. The game's charming artstyle and great brawler gameplay stands the test of time. To this day, Castle Crashers remains one of the best pick up and play co-op games out there.  Hundreds of hours wroth of replay ability with plenty of unlockable characters and mini games. GET THIS GAME ALREADY!"
219,"Honestly, it is both a fun and funny way to enjoy some time with your friends, whether its a first play through or you're just coming back to experience it all again, castle crashers never fails to leave you feeling satisfied."

252,"Maybe I have a bias for this game. I played this game with my brother and friends on my Xbox 360. This game was awesome, and I'd like to say that for today aswell.

Be warned, This game is 100% made for multiplayer. That aside, it's plenty fun with people if you have a good enough connection. Embark on a booty quest, kill anything in your way, and grief the hell out of the game in the level map.

The combat is just repetitive button sequences, but I had fun, and there surely is a way for you to have fun, with friends, aswell."
253,The way enemies can get beheaded is a nice touch.

260,goot
261,Gotta crash those castles.
262,I happily re-lived my childhood
263,"Honestly, a pretty great game. One of the more important games from my childhood, I'd say one of the big 3 (COD MW3, Skyrim and this). Kinda missing the fun I had playing this with a group of friends now that about a decade has passed, with a wave of nostalgia when I saw the videos. The fun I had playing this is indescribable, though maybe that was just my friends. 

I still ain't paying 12€ for a decade old game though. I swear I played this game a longer time ago. Maybe that's just the Steam publish date?

I played this on my PS3 a decade ago. I'm not entirely sure why Steam allows me to post a review. Maybe as I put ignored with another platform, but I appreciate the opportunity."
264,THE BEST
265,"This is another one of those games where you wish you had friends to play with you, and that's a good accomplishment for an indie game since it is pretty fun.... there's a poop joke so you probably hate it now."
266,Lives up to the hype. Crashes so many castles its unreal. You actually get the sense of what its like for real life castle crashing. Can't wait to see this done up with the unreal engine.

273,i love this game
274,best game ever
275,"It's a really cool game. You can adventure, and even get skins after beating the game. It's a really cool experience and I hope you have fun too. I remember playing this in 2016 - 2017 on an Xbox One. It was an amazing experience, and I hope you have fun too! Happy travels!"
276,i used to play this game on my Xbox 360 and i still have it to this day this game is pure nostalgia for me since i have played ever since i was 5 years old
277,One of my favorite games of all time
278,Always been a fan of this game. Coming home from school to play Castle Crashers with my mate. Always enjoyable and holds nice memories.
279,Its fun playing alone and together with friends. At first when you first start playing the game you won't be able to understand much but once you get the game you will feel like its a very fun and enjoyable game.
280,Very good game when i was like 5 i forgot the name and didnt have acsess to it anymore but then a little later i saw my sister playing geometry dash and i head the music fast forwart like a solid 6-7 years and i found it on tictok and instantly bought it (sorry for the life story)
281,"I Liked the game and I play more on PS3 but I still like this game and seeing this game on a computer is insane for me atleast cause I've only seen it on X-box and PS3 but honestly I still enjoy all versions. I used to play this with my dad when I was like 3 or 5 it was so fun! Although I only have 4.3 hours on steam I've played it more on PS3 and X-Box, and still it's a good game. I bought during the summer of this year. There was a Sale and the dlc pack was only 5 dollars! so I bought it.. And made it even more worth it.."
282,"This is one of my favorite games and I can not stop playing it (despite my hours played says) I used to play this game on my Xbox 360 and LOVED IT. I then forgot about this game for a good few years or so and just never remembered it but now I am back on ready to spend another 3 years getting all characters and bringing them all to max level then speed running the game with said max level characters. This game will make you cry, laugh, scream in anger, very mad, shoot someone, slam your desk in fury, and have fun. If you want to play a game that you will be able to have tons of replayability, about 30 or so characters you will unlock just by playing the game (all with different looks and abilities), and a game that doesn't require you to quit your job to finish or take 10 years to fully 100%? then this is your game, I believe I finished the game in about two sittings making up about 7-8 hours with one character, the first one being to only the second boss, and the second sitting was finishing the game. This game has 4 different princesses you get to kiss, along with owning lots of animals, and doesn't have long and confusing LORE (unlike some other games)."
283,im going to castle crash into the twin towers
284,"Shut the fuck up before I X, X, X, Y, Y, X, X, X, Y, Y, Y your ass"
285,"i have played this game on ps3,4 and now 5 and on pc.........well buy the game man its worth it."
286,very fun game to play by yourself AND with friends
287,best game ever
288,incredible beat em up experience even after all these years. Lots of replayability due to many characters to unlock and surprisingly high skill ceiling that's really put on show in insane mode. This game has 31 characters which requires 62 full playthroughs to get a gold skull on each one. Even though theres a set of 5 characters in there that are functionally identical I can still see myself finishing every character just for the hell of it because this game is that enjoyable with repeated playthroughs!
289,my friend likes it so i dont
290,good

HIS NAME IS ALIEN HOMINID CASTLE CRASHERS"
295,classic
296,im gay
297,great replay value
298,There is no other beat em up/hack and slash game that will EVER come close to being as amazing as Castle Crashers
299,this game brought me back to life
300,42 and a half out of 10 there is funni corn boss who goes boom
301,The game is infuriating if played alone. The magic never stops
302,great game
303,"There are a fair few issues with the game. My biggest annoyance is completing levels, leaving the game, and coming back to find they are locked again and you have to replay previous ones. Very frustrating. Just save the game after every level, or let me manually save!

The game can be quite boring single player.

There are multiple characters, but you won't play them because it resets you back to level one. You'd need to replay the game multiple times, and it isn't fun enough for that. As such, the extra characters are kind of pointless.

There's some kind of bonus minigame but no instructions for it, and it doesn't match the bonus minigame mentioned in the Wikipedia article.

On the plus side, it runs fine in Linux Mint Cinnamon 20.2."
304,"Play this with friends and you will have a blast for hours, even though the game is old it is still one of my favorites, If you have a xbox one/series x or a ps4/5 I would recommend buying the remastered version so you can play with all your friends on a couch in front of a 70 inch tv, that is where you will truly have fun, but it is also fun to play online with your friends or even just by yourself, playing the games multiple times to unlock new characters would typically be a downside to me but the game is great and I find it highly replayable because it's that fun. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who just wants a good time, and if you want an even better time convince your friends to buy it/play it with you."
305,q
306,10/10 game highly recommend
307,"fun game, easy to beat(for the most part)"

315,"Ill play for 10 more minutes... 

What do you mean its been 4 hours"
316,"Ah... I must say this is the game that started it all.  A lifetime ago, one of my brother's friends who lived nearby was selling his Xbox 360.  This was the first and only game I had for a long time.  (Parents rules about what games were allowed in the house)  I may not have many hours on Steam, but I have COUNTLESS hours of play on the 360 with my siblings.  And I wouldn't trade those times or memories for the world.  From the bugs to the exploits, the corn boss to the dragon.  I will forever love Castle Crashers."

326,"played this since xbox 360 would reccomd very cul and fun
"
327,It's fun and has great replayability
328,"Castle Crashers is a great game to pick up when it's on sale, you can usually find it for under £4 and it's a steal for the content offered.

You can play with friends or by yourself, with multiple game modes to explore. The story is simple and insignificant; Castle Crashers is more about the intense button mashing gameplay while unlocking new and exciting weapons, characters, pets and attack combos.

You can choose how to build your character by spending skill points in different categories, this creates a more personalised experience alongside picking your preferred weapon, pet and character.

Castle Crashers offers good replay value and incentive to unlock every character by beating the game in different ways, alongside collecting pets and weapons.

Co-Op is fun as you can play all the game-modes multiplayer, like the Arenas, the BoB Minigame, and of course Main Story. For the price it's a great game that can occupy you for hours on end."
329,fun game even though is is over a decade old. great speed of download and speed in general very to minimum of no lag.
330,goog
331,super fun to play with friends!
332,"i like when the main characters said ""its castle crashing time!"""

338,soooooo fun and masculine
339,amazing game u hate this u suck
340,"Stupid fun, especially in co-op. Probably the greatest beat-the-sh..-out-of-them-up in history, super-simple, super-funny, super-stupid, and super-super. Also, it's really stupid."
341,"good game but i wish i could kiss the buff knigths instead of the women, 9/10 experience"
342,it is very fun and a big grind and when you beat the game you can pick another character to beat the game all over again
343,The ultimate Co-Op game to pull an all nighter with.
344,A f****** classic and still a fun side scroll beat em up game. The music the characters the art all of it is great and the game has so many weapons and pets. Playing this reminds me of being on the Xbox 360 hacking and slashing enemies. The game is definitely a 9/10 and worth the play.
345,Good game.
346,Good Game
347,Fun little indie game to play on the side

372,"11/10
best game for 4 people, only cultured people plays this"
373,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
374,the final boss may made me pull my spine out of my ass and slap it on my forehead as i cried my eyes out but its fun

Not to mention how fun the bosses are (Painter for the win!!) and if you wanna collect all the player characters requires you to keep playing. All n all - game good :thumbsup:"
406,"It's a fun game, but only play it if your doing it w/ other friends. Otherwise the game just becomes 3x harder, and not fun as it's solely a co-op based game."

421,"This is a very fun game to play, but it's best to play it with a controller. The skeleton is my favorite character, but I haven't unlocked it yet. I played as it on the PS3. This game is more fun if you play it with friends. The boss fights aren't too difficult if you just memorize their moves. There are also mini games within the game if you don't feel like progressing through the story. 10/10 would recommend as a game to pass time."

It is genuinely one of the funnest games to play with friends, also if you like lego games you are most likely going to enjoy this game as the levels are very similar to that of lego games. Its funny, has a great art style and is one of my personal favorite games of all time

437,"It's definitely not as good as games like Streets of Rage 4 or Double Dragon Neon, but it's a solid beat em up in a genre that's been lacking with quality product for way too many years and has a huge fan base waiting for it to come back.  As long as you can get past, enjoy, or ignore all the diarrhea humor of act 2 you'll probably have a good time with this game."

577,I crashed the castle.
578,pog
579,"absolutey splendid game to play wi eh boys, would recomd to fucking nobdy"
580,"Should be a staple of anybody who likes beatemups and controller based games. Tons of humor, solid gameplay and progression, tons of repeat plays especially with friends. I'd solidly recommend anything by the behemoth."
581,A Classic.
582,Good story
583,"insanely chaotic and very reminiscent of a cartoon, i would recommend"

585,"
Very fun oldie :)"

587,So boring my balls popped
588,i love to crash castles with my friends but i keep accidentally resetting my progress... 10/10 would crash castles again.
589,this game is a time capsule ong
590,"I'm gonna make this simple for you reading this now, if you do not like any of the things here, you will most likely not enjoy this game
Potty humor
Repetitive gameplay
The harder difficulty is basically impossible without a boring combo
Friends
Onto the upsides of the game (if you like most of the things listed, come on already, buy it!)
Really nice art and animation style
4-18 humor
Short storyline with decent replayability
friends
Playing a role from the variety of magic
friends
Knights-Castles-Dragons-Pets-N such
friends
Castle Crashers is a really good replayable beat up game with a good (but sometimes cringeworthy) type of humor, with all kinds of magic to play with and cute animals to befriend. It's good with friends, and if you have them, you should probably get the game.
...
WAIT YOU DON'T CRASH A SINGLE CASTLE-"
591,when they crash the castle? my favorite.
592,Top 10 games ever. Fantastic game play and soundtrack
593,Fun to play with the kids.  Not too hard if you level up and get new weapons. Bosses will wear out your thumbs.

619,Quite a magnificent game
620,:)
621,amazing game to play with friends even if your alone its till fun even after reaching endgame you can change characters for a different kind of experience highly recommended
622,The best brawler ever.  Easy to pick up yet surprisingly deep.  Utterly fantastic as a couch co-op game.
623,best video game soundtrack of all time
624,This is the greatest game that has ever been made and if you think otherwise you arent real
625,Absolutely legendary game.
626,X X Y Y
627,"Castle Crashers is a wacky quest in which you do combat with all manner of creatures in order to defeat a large bully, a couple overweight cats, an engineer, a pianist, someone who's visually impaired, a sock puppet, a snake lover, a piece of corn, an ice cube, an artist, an emo, and an introvert.

Play a variety of characters, find a multitude of cute lil floating companions, wield a myriad of weapons, slaughter an enormous quantity of living things, and more!

I recommend this game to fighters, button-mashers, people who have friends, completionists, adventurers, and everyone who desperately wants a farting/defecating deer to save their life."
628,Castle Crashers is both challenging and charming.
629,My friend has too much fun on his own :(((((((((((((((((((((((

It's such a fun little beat-em-up game and the  jokes are still pretty dang funny even after all my playthroughs. Couldn't recommend enough"
666,"good game, perfect for gamer's who have friends, so not you but you know, you can also play on your own, like you always do."

693,"THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

694,i have been hooked on this game since i first started it i have played for 30 hours in one week. The game is simple but has a very high skill ceiling so it allows for experienced people to have fun. I promise that you will like this game too.
695,helpeo
696,"I cannot crash castles, but still good."
697,"It's one of those games where you say to a friend, ""hey wanna play Castle Crashers?"" and then you proceed to play the game and beat it within 5 hours for the 500th time. Absolute blast."

708,fun game
709,good
710,I have finished this game lots of times and have dedicated lots of hours on it over multiple accounts. I've got to say that I never really got bored of it and I mean it. I could spent hours a day grinding on this game and enjoy myself. It's a timeless classic and it's a must have for everyone.
711,great game

713,This takes me back when I had played this in 2008 on the Xbox 360.
714,very fun
715,great ass game
716,"Good game. GOD GAME! It is fair, challenging, and fun. The game never gets old even if you have to replay it over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over AgAiN."
717,"I am a 54 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
"
718,"I loved this game on the 360. Playing this on steam feels so much better, especially with the additional content. Not to mention it looks a lot better here. :)"

729,"the coop is really good but the bad side is if one of ur friends is lagging everyone has to wait for that one guy to get a better connection so all of ur friend need to have a stable conection otherwise ur game prolly freeze every 5-10 second and a text will popped out saying ""waiting for players"""
730,"bro i love this game its a classic, its my childhood"

732,Absolute chad moves if you're still playing this amazing game
733,An all time great!
734,"awesome game with great game play and a challenge but not a really hard and unfair feel and it's so silly that with friend it's a whole word of inside joke's like a crow became ""the crow of evil"" and we play that level the crow is mentioned"
735,"Pro: 
- Perfect game to play with your cute gf
- Battle out relationship problems 

Con: 
- Now she's addicted to it and not interested in sex anymore."
736,"Very good, very hard."
737,this game i so freaking good the only problem i have with it is that there is not much pets otherwise this game is good
738,"An absolute blast to play with friends, this is a top tier addition to the classic beat ‘em up category. Lots of replayability, fun boss fights, and a surprisingly good soundtrack all add to the value. Tack on a large arsenal of stat boosting weapons and “animal orbs,” as well as a solid combo and magic system that provides some variety to regular combat, and you have a real winner on your hands.

That’s not to say the game is without fault. Some of the unlockable characters are just reskins of each other, and there are some minor bugs that make certain levels in insane mode unnecessarily hard, but beating insane mode isn’t a requirement for unlocking any of the achievements, and the pros of the game far outweigh the cons in my opinion.

TLDR: If you enjoy beat ‘em ups, or are just looking for a great game to play with friends, go ahead and pick this up. If you’re still on the fence, just wait until it goes on sale because then it’s definitely worth it."
739,i luv it.
740,I used to play this game on xbox all the time and honestly I still love this game. It has so much to do and a humorous style that I love. This is a good game.
741,"This game has been my childhood game and after all these years its still very good and much better with friends. Obvioulsy reccomend it if you like fighting game, because this one is gonna explode your mind"
742,LOTS OF FUN
743,"Sooooooooooooo much content my head is going to POP! This game will have you playing for hours solo or team up with friends, 4 players and a BAGILLION characters to chose from. Not to mention its a Behemoth game so expect the silliness. Over 10 years later and still a GOOD BUY in my book."
744,"This is an amazing game and I have played it back on the Xbox360 and I suggest it. However, I beat the game today and now I can't open it anymore. Anytime I try it goes black then exits out of the game again. I have reinstalled it multiple times but it will not work."
745,this game is utter dogshit
746,*weewoooweewooweewoo* that's the sound of the freaking too much fun alarm (pardon my absurd language)

759,Sometimes when the going also. Three thousand times have i . Big ass
760,I played this when I was kid it was fun at first so I decided to playing this again still enjoying it. It’s fun to you have to fighting with enemies but it’s hard to be solo it’s easy to die but you will growing your level and getting strong enough to fighting enemies. Still OG and best game <3

774,"Wonderful artstyle that still holds up with fun addicting gameplay, though this game is best played with a friend or more as it really shines best with a group. Solo is still a fun experience but again COOP with a friend or more is just better in every single way making it a really great party style game."

788,"I can see where the appeal is and that's why I'm giving this game a thumbs up, it's weird because I feel I've def played more than 4 hrs on this, perhaps on another account. The art style is great and still holds up in modern day in my opinon, the animations themselves as well as the comedic ques that happen on your journey help add to the goofy yet fun experience you'll have when playing with friends. I myself didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would, I'm not really into bullet sponge grunt enemies but I see where someone who has played the game a long while can rack up some combos and go beast mode, still I feel like it does take a lot to kill at least medium level enemies that aren't mini bosses. I also feel like the skill trait upgrades don't do much in this as I boosted my strength to max and still feel like I did when the game first started, the best thing to make you feel more like a badass is ofcourse the weapons of which there are a decent amount to choose from all with their own advantages and disadvantages however clearly some are better than others. I'd wait til this goes on sale again personally but if you and some friends are itching to try it the 15 bucks isn't too bad"

1025,"I am a 54 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

1039,"Fantastic and hilarious, action-packed game suitable for 6 & 8 year old kids and dad loving it too. NEED controllers, did not work using PC + mouse alongside kids using controllers in local co-op."
1040,"In my top 5 games, i've played it for 13 hours in TWO DAYS."
1041,Fun and doesn't need high specifications I really enjoy and play it with my friends
1042,This game is a certified hood classic
1043,fight things go boom boom
1044,10/10 good game play and story
1045,fun party game
1046,castles are crashing
1047,"This game is not a waste of your time! The story is fantastic, game play is awesome and this'll never get stale! You can unlock about every character in the game excluding certain bosses, each character has their own abilities and weapons. There are pets that can buff your stats and some have abilities.

Well, feeling lonely while playing the game? Worry not! Local Multiplayer and Online Multiplayer is real! With local multiplayer you can play with your friends in the same house. However, Online Multiplayer supports both random matches and online matches with your friends! And don't think you'll be playing the entire game from start to finish. When you replay on the same characters you will load back into your previous save!

Overall this game was an experience, I recommend it to everyone reading this comment. This is a masterpiece beyond its time released, this is why I want more people to recognize this gem of a game. I hope this review helped you on buying this game.

1065,Great game for taking your mind off of the fact you have covid
1066,i loved the boss design and the game mechanics
1067,"This is the Magnum Opus of Indie Games. Nothing will reach the sheer happines I get when I hear the OST from this game, and the only GamePlay I've experienced that comes close is Minecraft, but the genres vary vastly. All in All, if you haven't played Castle Crashers, you should. It will entertain you for atleast 40 hours and I'd argue that with friends, that value is doubled. Truly a masterpiece."
1068,Good game to play with friends or even alone and it feels like a flash game!
1069,goot

Some of the best memories I have with my friends - 10/10 Amazing game

P.S. Archery is best"

1091,awesome game
1092,"This game is so fun and hella nostalgic. i grew up on this game and I must say, if you want this game, GET IT! This game has some of its difficult times or some easy times, god forbid there is nothing this game doesn't have! It has weird and funky weapons like a tp roll and a lobster, it also has wacky pets like alien eyeballs to fire breathing dragons! This game has so much variety to choose from to suite your'e playstyle! From knights who use electricity to knights who are Eskimos and throw snowballs. If you have money for this gaame, spend it on this game. ALSO I RECOMMEND PLAYING WITH SOMEONE ELSE TO MAKE THE GAME MORE FUN"
1093,I havent seen a game like this for awhile. The combos and magic make it really fun. Along with the side scroller style instead of an open world or so.
1094,reds kinda hot ngl

1101,"Game wise, Castle Crashers is pretty similar with Metal Slug. Both are simple and easy game that is perfect to kill time. So this game is pretty nostalgic to me, who love Metal Slug so much. 

This game also visually pleasing for me. The colors are vibrant and bright, each characters has it's own specialty which making co-op mode more interesting. What's more fun about this game, it may help you to enjoy your time with your friends.

Anyone can enjoy this game. It's pretty simple to learn but still challenging."

1132,"Bought this game on three platforms and played this game almost the same amount of time on the others.

The game is easy to play and really pretty short. 
That is until you complete it for the first time and realise you now have to replay it 40 times to get all the characters.
With that said, you also unlock some kind of hard mode that proves to be challenging. 

The gameplay is not revolutionary, but you can grow some skills and test your courage in order to free the princesses.
It's wortj 20 bucks fr"

1140,Basically Alien Hominid with a reskin and levelling up system. It's a great game that becomes better with local multiplayer.
1141,This game is about you savibng a princess in a castle and being a guy in a red hat who has to beat levels and bosses to save the princess from bowser
1142,"i have completed this game heaps growing up and im still only 14. I played with my dad on my ps3.

1155,It fun. Friend steals gold. Friend takes eneimes. Friend steal ladies. Me die. He save. leaves me sad.  Quit W.
1156,"Joguei Castle Crashers pela primeira vez no Xbox com meu tio quando tinha 14 anos. Foi uma experiência única. Nunca tinha jogado um joguinho 2D, hack n slash que me cativasse tanto como esse. Comprei pra jogar com minha irmã e foi uma experiência muito top. Único defeito é que o online multiplayer dele é bem ruim. Fica bem lagado pra quem se conecta. Mas pra jogar em uma tela, é perfeito."
1157,Excellent game!!!!!
1158,"Played this game a lot when I was younger and replaying many years later this game still holds up. A fun, short adventure that does not overstay its welcome with lots of charm. Still one of my favorite games and an absolute classic."

1200,amazing game adapting to the feel of a modern game but keeping some of the charm of a cartoony side scroller
1201,good
1202,"This is a neat little Story Game where from a bunch of chooseable heroes you have to save the Princesses. 
There are multiple combos with each heros which differ in their output. For example, Lighting Charge for the Red Knight. But you can also level up each hero a lot and become much stronger with higher stats and new abilities. 
You can unlock a total of 31 Heroes which is just insane, and it would take a LONG time to unlock and max out them all.

But what do you even have to do in order to save the princesses?
Well you have to defeat a lot of enemies in different Areas which all lead to a Major Boss at the end. All the Bosses differ in their abilities and size. The Game is very cartoony which leads to many ""funny"" jokes. Well they are defenetly over the top. 

This isn't a Game meant to be taken Serious. It is for Entertainment and since there's an awesome Coop Mode. You will surely be pleased playing it with a friend or more."
1203,real
1204,bro this game is so good the only minus is at one point there is a huge gap between checkpoints but 9.6 out of 10 and its like minecraft dungeons but... ya know good
1205,"Warning, this show contains scenes of graphic stupidity among four lifelong friends who compete to embarrass each other. Viewer Discretion is advised."
1206,"I first played this game on my 360 with my brother. This game is really quite nostalgic for me BUT even despite this i still rank it among the most fun games ive ever played.
Graphics: The visuals are what you'd expect from 2010 era newgrounds but it has its own Spider-Ham-esque charm.
Gameplay: while the story is fairly simple, the sheer enjoyment makes it endlessly replayable.  The mechanics are easy to understand and very versatile making combat stay pretty fress for a while. The movement is a little rough but you learn to play around it.
all in all, while this game might not be perfect, and it wont be winning any awards, i think its worth your time, ESPECIALLY if you have 1+ friends to play it with."

1237,I like every part the only part i have a problem is is the volley ball part cause you can score on yourself and I made them win caus practically every time i hit the ball it landed on my side and they got a point
1238,"I usually don't write reviews for games, but this is one of my favorite games i've ever played. I used to play with my best buds when I was younger, so maybe that's why I like it so much. I continue to replay it every now and then. This game is so fun, having the ability to replay it as a different knights is so fun, and choosing where your points go is always awesome. This game will always have a place in my heart."

1265,"nostalgic game very fun
combat - very fun and complex
story - pretty basic but i like it that way
gameplay - super silly
difficulty - very hard if you dont know what youre doing
very good game"
1266,"This game is very interesting with all the lore and battles that it has to offer. However, that is one thing that overcomes the entire game-play.

The ships.

While there are many snips that can be found and perhaps theorized but there is one ship that is superior to all. That ship is Purple Knight x Pink Knight. Just the idea of having a tough blacksmith fall in love with a homosexual feminine man is very enjoyable to me. It also amazes me as well is how they were enemies and soon become lovers. Which is one of my favorite tropes. I hope that if this game ever gets a sequel, or even a prequel, we will see the lore or future of the couples relationship.

However, there is a slight problem in the game. Whenever the Pink Knight or Purple Knight win a duel with the other knights, they end up kissing a princess. However, this error should be changed since the two knights are both canonically gay and are sex repulsed by women. They belong with each other and only each other.

All I request is that perhaps if there is ever an update that there be such a thing as duo combos or perhaps even voice acting. I would love to see the two characters interact more in the game in the future."
1267,who the FUCK doesn't like this game?
1268,ONE of the funnest adventure game I played with friends!

1295,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

1373,"This game is bad. not from a quality standpoint, well kind of. the humor is bad, the controlls are bad, just almost everything about the game is bad. I don't hate the devs or anything, I just don't like this game, you might like it, I dont think I care. Have fun If you want! its not like i'm in charge of you. you don't have to read this review anymore. you can just scroll down to see another one. I do not like this game but you can."
1374,FUN
1375,very fun multiplayer game that still manages to be good when alone
1376,"A Timeless Classic. If you have never played this before... All I can say is get on it, it's worth it."
1377,Fun.
1378,I wish I had more hours but I have been into a lot of Terraria but this game is amazing but it does depend on the person you are when it comes to this game
1379,"Recently replayed, still great, especially with someone on co-op, which was the main reason I remember buying this game.

For the second game I ever bought on Steam in 2015, on sale for less than a dollar when converted to my country's currency, this has got to be one of the best purchases I have ever made on Steam. (plus Battleblock Theater, so like, less than 2 dollars lmao)"
1380,very good but like my brain is too slow for combat
1381,:)
1382,hurts my brain
1383,theres so much fecal matter
1384,This game is nostalgic
1385,YES
1386,I absolutely love Castle Crashers! It is a classic and lots of fun whether you are playing alone or with others. I would totally recommend this game to anyone who wants a lot of laughs and just a overall fun time.
1387,Best game ever.
1388,pertty good got this game on ps4 xbox and pc
1389,cstalst crash the second
1390,Peak
1391,best game ever
1392,incrivel
1393,if you're looking for a fun (but challenging) game to play with your friends then you should definitely play castle crashers!
1394,"good 

3"
1395,they crash and they castle too
1396,I love this game and would recommend it to everyone to play!
1397,"Insanely fun and addictive hack and slasher. Get it for the love of god
 "
1398,I like slicing the apple trees
1399,its gud
1400,Super iconic art style and great soundtrack. Gameplay is actually pretty boring unless you know how to do infinite combos and fly around for no reason. Recommended because this game is awesome to just sit down and play with friends for a few days. Solo isn't very fun in my opinion.
1401,i have 434 hours on this so.... yes
1402,Game gets me hella hard ong
1403,crashing castles very yes
1404,"this game is jit trippin, thats why i love it, its gory humor and i love it and it can be scary at some times (mostly in insane mode)"
1405,fun party game.
1406,l
1407,its meh
1408,I like playing this game alot with my friend sooooo 10/10.

1410,i have no friends
1411,pls buy this
1412,"This game is not a waste of your time! The story is fantastic, game play is awesome and this'll never get stale! You can unlock about every character in the game excluding certain bosses, each character has their own abilities and weapons. There are pets that can buff your stats and some have abilities. 

Well, feeling lonely while playing the game? Worry not! Local Multiplayer and Online Multiplayer is real! With local multiplayer you can play with your friends in the same house. However, Online Multiplayer supports both random matches and online matches with your friends! And don't think you'll be playing the entire game from start to finish. When you replay on the same characters you will load back into your previous save!

Overall this game was an experience, I recommend it to everyone reading this comment. This is a masterpiece beyond its time released, this is why I want more people to recognize this gem of a game. I hope this review helped you on buying this game."
1413,A masterpiece
1414,"good game

I first bought this when i was in 4th grade and now i just graduated from my junior year in highschool. I am somehow always coming back to this game. I don't know why, but im not complaining. Highly recommend you atleast try this classic!"

1465,this game was great and you're paying a lot less than the game is worth. If you enjoy some potty humor swords and clowns this game is for you i have purchased this game on 3 different platforms.

It's a game that will go down in history as probably the most fun co-op game to play with your buds after school in middle school."

1479,Would fuck green knight 10/10
1480,goood game

1482,"I love this game, I have loved it since I first played it with my friend on his Xbox many years ago, I think everyone should play it at least once, but honestly you'll definitely want to play it more than once"
1483,Childhood nostalgic trip again finished with more funnier memories! 100% recommended for dumb fun :D
1484,Good game
1485,"Simple graphics, but charming in some weird way. Some ""quirks"" of the art style really just make the humor funnier.
The gameplay is smooth, having a really neat system for unlocking moves through the different ""levels"", and it plays nicely with the theme! Good score for gameplay.
I would say the humor in this game is meant for newgrounds lovers and people who just want something random and unexpected, so around teens/adults.
I do not really know what to say for specs requirements, but I have a gaming laptop and it runs really well, as expected for this kind of game, but I played bendy and the ink machine and this thing still kind of lags so yeah.
A good part of the ""hard to master"" part is all the moves you can combo together. Its a lot of effort to remember! Even if you might get frustrated or die a bit, its a decently hard game that isn't bullshit levels of hard.
If you wanna get certain items/characters, then it'll take some effort, but its usually a good treat and is not that long.
Funny princess(es) get captured by bad guy and you wanna get hard so you save them. Simple story, but not too complex.
It is decently long game for the price, and even features online and offline multiplayer, plus extra modes!
Price was cheap for a game of this magnitude. Not a AAA 80 dollar game, but not some 3 dollar knockoff either.
Never heard of any bugs for this, and I've never seen any.
8/10

Modified a random steam review template to put it in my own words. Fuck you credits :DDDDD
Made by a guy who barely played this game and has no idea what he's writing :>"
1486,good
1487,cheap and funny game
1488,I hate the corn boss

1498,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

8/10"
1540,"haha, yeah"
1541,very fun and hard
1542,"This game is incredibly entertaining. Has nice music. Cute graphics, and is hella fun.
It's also super button mashy, and excessive enemy health coupled w/ low damage, will leave you with hand cramps, if your play session is too long. So take breaks regularly, and you'll definitely have a blast."
1543,this is a very good game i finished it in 4 hours its very good my favorite character is the ice knight tell me what u think down below i been playing for 11 trying to upgrade my other people

1573,"When you have a mate to play with you, this game is hella fun, but if you don't have anyone to play with you it's gonna be kinda hard and boring at the same time. :("
1574,"Per my son: ""I like it because it's constant fighting, boss after boss,  power ups, and really funny. I also like the pooping deer."""

1579,amazing game i mauled a little boy over a ginger princess
1580,it makes you feel cool
1581,"I hope there was an easier difficulty to choose.
Due to its casual looks on the game, it did attract super-casual gamers.
However, it was quite challenging for me to play with them.

You know, if you are not a super-casual player with better skills, you got better options out there in the first place."
1582,dw
1583,grr
1584,I will never recover from the Clussy ending
1585,fun
1586,"very charming graphics, a good combat system, and a lot of replayability"
1587,I beat up women
1588,the best game to ever exist
1589,The game is epic. Pretty one of the developers has a shit fetish though.
1590,criminally underpriced
1591,"Great game! Great artstyle! I highly reccomend this game! My friend requested it to me, so I bought it, and it was a great purchase."
1592,"This is a really dumb game, but that's what makes it so amazing. i suggest playing with others, but even single player is pretty fun."
1593,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game.

1594,good.
1595,"A wonderful side scrolling smash em up fighting style game!  Could play for many more hours on end, will love to play over and over again due to the amount of different characters you can unlock.  Don't forget the multiple weapons and pets you can obtain on your adventures.  Check this game out!"
1596,oog
1597,swag
1598,Super fun and entertaining game!! wish they could do castle crashers 2 sometime
1599, best ever
1600,Game very fun lots of stuff also very nostalgic
1601,SO FUN
1602,"yea it's good, i'm very nostalgic for it."
1603,Very fun game
1604,yes
1605,based
1606,THIS IS THE BEST FUCKING GAME EVER BUY IT OR ELSE
1607,Played this game since I was but a young boy. One of the best games of the century for when it comes to socializing with your friends while kickin' back and gamin' some of that good shit.
1608,"It's an oldie but a goody. It's a fun game about cute drawn little knights to save the princesses that are kidnapped, but it's not your average rescue mission. This game has a very funny way to tell a story. Like everything starts with enemy knights invading your kingdom and a typical middle aged war going on. Some wizards and orcs get in the way and then you fight a....... giant corn on a cob?! Yep, its a wacky game alright. I absolutely love their humor. Give this a try and you won't be disappointed."
1609,yes
1610,loved the game
1611,duh
1612,"While it appears I only have 46.6 hours, on Xbox I have way more than that. Therefore I can say this:

This game has taken so much fucking time from me, I have lost YEARS and YEARS of my life, I physically cannot gain ANY of it back. 100/10 I fuckin' recommend, it's so god damn fun, but please for the love of god don't try beating the game with every character and then trying insane mode with every character, you will lose most of your life.

Anyways devs, you should totally make like another DLC for another map for everyone to explore, like a new final boss and a quest to do, yet it doesn't have to be as big. (Please I need to waste my life more)"
1613,goofy ahh ending
1614,COOL
1615,Deus vult
1616,Good game
1617,i love crashing and destroying forts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1618,tasty and good song
1619,"Simply a masterpiece.

Why was there never a second game?"
1620,oguz
1621,Kept me alive through an 8 hour flight.
1622,I played this game when I was little and it still holds the same charm. Love it.
1623,Good game
1624,"This game is honestly has a perfect Newgrounds feeling, and yet the graphics feel almost timeless in a way. Super expressive animation and I love it so much. Next is the gameplay, which is the most perfectly balanced stuff I've seen in a while. It's satisfying enough to keep you invested, but difficult enough to provide a very good challenge. The replay value of insane mode and extra content is also a nice addition. The only complaint I have is multiplayer, which I believe should be moved to different save file if chosen so. Aside from that, this is amazing, and I can't wait for future releases."
1625,yes
1626,"Castle Crashers is an adventure game, with a fun art style, where you are set on rescuing 4 princesses that were taken during an invasion on your castle. You and up to 3 friends will come across many different enemy types as well as a couple dozen bosses. The game has a  simple leveling system with 4 different categories to sink skill points into depending on your play style. I highly recommend playing this game with friends because it makes for some great memories especially when you are forced to fight each other over who gets to kiss the princess."
1627,It's a good game to play once in a while.
1628,My balls fell out of place
1629,nice game
1630,"i played this when i was, like, 10? 12?, and i still love playing it. several years later. its absolutely fun"

1643,Nostalgic and overall fun to play over and over!
1644,"Finally, women are forced to kiss me because they are tied to a pole"
1645,classic
1646,0/10 no castle crashed yet I will cry
1647,"i liek this game it makes me habby, it also looks cool like it is awseome !@!!!!! wanna play?"
1648,is a great classic game
1649,s
1650,yes
1651,"It's very short, It can be but a bit annoying when your under-leveled. Its always fun with friends! It may take A while If you don't know what your doing but if you have a spare few hours waiting for a plane or something, you could probably complete the game starting at lvl 1"
1652,similar to cuphead
1653,very good game with amazing art and a fun and funny story. Buy this game and play and you will not regret it.
1654,It's very good game to play with friends but if you play alone this game also very good 🙂
1655,This game is very cool but its way better with friends.
1656,游戏很好玩，要是有朋友一起玩就更好玩了
1657,"Game was super fun, and great game to play with friends"
1658,I have three cancerous moles on my cervix and am currently getting brain surgery after i got bleeding on the brain from a punch dealt to me by a big man named Francis
1659,nice
1660,very good
1661,"Endless fun with or without friends. I would call it a brawler, because it puts a lot of emphasis on battle moves, reminds me a lot of golden axe. The campaign is limited (about 30-35 levels), but once you beat it you can try insane mode or replay with a different character, and there are lots of them. You can realistically play this game forever before you discover everything it has to offer."
1662,"awesome game
"
1663,A classic.
1664,fire game
1665,it's a very nice game where you can play with or without your friends it has a lot of characters the only disadventage it has is that the game is very short.
1666,"Good graphics and extremely fun to play with friends even after a decade after release.

10/10 game"

1688,"A fun time with friends. Buy it on a sale or if you have some free time and want a simple and fun adventure. Despite its simplistic nature and game play, there is enough diversity in characters to make additional completions entertaining."
1689,peener go boing boing kill john lennon
1690,CASLTE CEASHERS great game fun but bosses are easly cheese able

1703,"Tom Felp is one of my favorite game developers ever, making games like Pico's School or Alien Hominid. This game hold up to the test of time."
1704,Great couch co-op for all ages. Despite the age of the game the style has really held up over time.
1705,I loved this game growing up and In still do now I would love to see more people playing this 10000/10 game.
1706,"I love this game, the art style, the characters, and all the stuff you can do in it(so basically the game). This game is really fun but playing with ppl/friends is more fun but not all ppl enjoy it, my friends played it and got bored after 5 levels but its still really fun, and the end fooled me i thought i beat the game when he got crushed by the chest but nope. You should get the game if your seeing this and have not got it GET IT NOW IT IS REALLY FUN."
1707,haha yes
1708,this is one of my top 20 games ever play it
1709,Funny insane mode make me go insane
1710,"7, 4, 9, 3, 21, 10, 42, 47, 144, 132, 192"
1711,loved
1712,"One of the best 2d games I have played in many years and I remember loving this game when I was younger, playing for hours everyday with friends on console. 

The graphics and sound design are really clean with a charm that I have not seen in many of the more recent games I have played. If you are a casual gamer you will enjoy this game and much of the storyline and immersive gameplay, while if you are a more advanced or hardcore player you can spend time mastering many of the combos and neat little tricks as you level up. The insane mode also gives a difficult challenge which will have you searching to max out your stats and improve your combat and movement skills. The coop mode is well made too. You can't play as the same character as someone else so that could create arguments, but for the sake of story it makes sense so I won't take points off for that. I don't think a controller is too important but it does take some time to get used to using a keyboard as you will need to hotkey, which can be annoying to learn at first. Some hit selection can be bad but it is not too major and I haven't experienced too much, but be weary if you are planning to play insane mode as I have been affected there.

Final rating: 9.5 / 10
Great game with excellent storyline, graphics, and audio."
1713,yay
1714,pp
1715,"If anything they should of sold the ability to prevent mods to be done to any company that doesnt like community support. Because no matter how casual and old as this game is in the end, Its locked down like its holding state secrets LOL jk"
1716,good game but i got mad sorry to kesley too
1717,i jerked off to the orange princess
1718,"very fun game to goof off with friends, not when you're playing insane mode though 9/10 would recommend"
1719,Absolute Godlike Classic.

1760,"Castle Crashers. Where do I even begin? This has to be if not the BEST game of my entire childhood. I grew up watching animations and loving these iconic knight characters. I love every level and everything about this game. I love the levels, the weapons, the animal orbs, and most importantly the boss fights and AMAZING soundtracks. I love the humor that is included with this game and it's just astonishing. I grew up playing this on the xbox 360 but unfortunately had nobody to play with :( I love this game with everything and I had even got some art that my girlfriend drew of necromancer and I was like wow:)
Amazing game
Will forever be in the core of my heart.
I love you behemoth
can't wait till Alien Hominid Remastered comes out

1774,"i suggest not taking 5 tabs of acid and playing this game, at that point you are castle crashers"
1775,"this game kinda busssinnnnngggg


red knight best knight
"
1776,"Out of all the games I've played, this one has really stuck with me. It's just such a special and fun game, I'm still not really over it 14 years after it came out. Really fun and good looking game, plus a good (as you can get) community. Just buy it already honestly"
1777,its pretty good ig
1778,Classic beat-em up with lots of fun characters and weapons.
1779,cool
1780,yes

1782,Very Fun game.

1792,You hit the enemies and uh yea that's it
1793,"anyone who remembers this immediately gets a nostalgia trip for good reason

fun colorful graphics
humor that is still somehow funny to date
quite literally a chad game to even have in your library
many different characters 
easy to learn very hard to master
i say this is worth your time but only if it graciously goes on sale, because it is priced at $14.99

8-9/10 would definitely get buddies to play this with"
1794,buen juego. 10/10 buen juego. si. buen juego. si. recomiendo juego. si. deberias jugar.
1795,"Hello guys this is sanjit rashit from sanjit rashit tips window tips part 1500, today we will be talking about how to connect your controller to pc, obamas last name is ..."
1796,better than valorant
1797,"I've played this game a while back when I used to play this on xbox 360, and I can say that to me my opinion has not changed. This game is still extremely fun and action packed, it's mostly best when playing with family or friends but it's still fun to play even solo. There's a ton of characters, pets, and weapons to choose from even if most of them kinda suck and you'll end up using the same three weapons. Kinda annoying having to pass the game multiple times just to unlock your favorite characters (Modding is an option to unlocking your characters quicker but most don't go that route, but it is an option.) But nonetheless, it's an extremely fun game and I still recommend this."
1798,"game good
reminds me when i played a ninja turtles arcade game with the homies"
1799,"I love it, i played this with a friend and we had such a nice time."
1800,coioi

1803,"Very Fun, Nostalgic, and Fun with Friends"
1804,"The side scrolling button mashing fun of this game is unparalleled.  Plus you can earn so many new characters and find so many weapons, it's easy to play this game over and over with a different experience every time."
1805,"funny, good music, good art style, fun game, all around well made."
1806,"its fun
"
1807,funky
1808,poo poo make me go HAHAHAHAH
1809,fun with friends
1810,I'll castle your crasher.
1811,easily the best childhood-game in existence
1812,fun
1813,it is a gode game
1814,Arrow build or no balls
1815,i like it i guess
1816,There's a reason so many people have fond memories of this game. It's relatively simple with engaging moment to moment gameplay that makes you want to smash more heads. The art is simple and clear with a lovely style. It's a classic for a reason.
1817,tis fun and pretty epic
1818,Best childhood game 10/10
1819,yes
1820,"Incredible game. Played the game alot during childhood in 2016 since it was my favourite game on the xbox 360. Even if the game gets repetitive as you play different characters, the game play reminds me how enjoyable the experiences were."
1821,helmet man mass murder
1822,100% a fun and good game
1823,"has a very retro feel, difficult without a controller but still enjoyable.
"
1824,yes
1825,I've played this game across several platforms for years. It has become a main stay in my collection for a really fun and somewhat silly co-op beat em up experience with a neat leveling and magic system which succeeds in being both simple and fun to use. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who likes the old school fighting games. 5 stars.
1826,"I definitely recommend this game if you like beat 'em up games, the mechanics are amazing! 
Its also a classic, the nostalgia I get from playing is crazy."
1827,buff
1828,"Great game recommend it if u like fighting 
"
1829,"All time favorite game. Uncontested for split-screen, in-the-same room gaming fun."
1830,"pov no pp
"
1831,crash cawstle
1832,Aint nothing like a classic
1833,"So this game only took me a total of 30.6 hours to complete. I completed it in singleplayer mode however I enjoyed this game and is very fun. You can play it both on single and multiplayer with friends through steam. It is fun both single and multiplayer. Would really recommend a controller for this howevs I mainly played with keyboard and I managed to complete the game. As well as playing the full game, you can play mini games like back off barbarian and arena. You can unlock swaggy skins it is worth your money so go for it."
1834,"i love jumping and stomping children 10/10 would play again
the dlcs make the game an even greater jump and stomp children simulator."
1835,this game is good and nice and cool and fun. lots of entertaining sword slash bonk and kill. magic very nice and delectable. would play again
1836,"lit

as

fuck"
1837,Super Epic Poggers
1838,"This game taught me at a young age, to be the ultimate simp I would have to kill my friends. 10/10 would recommend."
1839,fun
1840,This game is good especially if you have friends to play it with. Takes a good while to become boring but after you're over the game it's really hard to get back into the gameplay loop. The combat is simple yet kind of complicated when you get into more advanced aerial combos. Back Off Barbarian sucks.
1841,"Awesome casual game where you can feel cool as you run through the game beating people up. I play with my girlfriend and its a game she can handle because all she has to do is press x,y lol"
1842,It's a whimsical and fun little brawler
1843,balls
1844,This game is amazing on any platform ngl
1845,"Oddly addictive, 8/10"
1846,"This game is hilarious with friends, we played 12+ hours straight laughing the hole 12 hours its a fun and funny game and after you beat the game there is still so much more to do like playing the story on insane mode"
1847,This game is better than it seems when you really get into it. Its like a side-scrolling beatem up with some rpg elements. I personally like the game I own it for most of my current gen systems and I can't wait to beat it on my pc now.
1848,fun and good game
1849,best game
1850,good game. make me happy.
1851,Very much worth the price as it's entertaining for all ages

1875,best game from xbox to steam
1876,neat
1877,Though this game is relatively old I still consider this one of the best jack and slash beat'em up game I've played in a long time. The replayability is there for those that love unlockables.
1878,Eh its ok. just not my kind of game
1879,it has good balls
1880,"Fun 2D scrolling game. Most of my playtime was on the Xbox version of this, but decided to get it on Steam."
1881,this game has a very nice soundtrack and gameplay and is very fun and worth the price.
1882,cool
1883,Foda!
1884,"It's great to play with firends. Even if you suck at the  game, if you're good enough at button mashing, your friends will carry you the rest of the way. That being said, it feels a bit difficult to play in some places, especially with a keyboard and htting enemies can be very tricky with the depth element in there."
1885,Speer glüht
1886,Fun with friends! Little bit on the short side though :(
1887,"beautiful game

1889,سكنر زبال معيي يلعبها ويانا
1890,"If you are looking for a cheep game to play with you buddies, look no further. Castle Crashers has a lot to offer for different builds for your character. The game takes aroun 7-10 hours depending on your skill. The game is a 4 player co-op game and offers a ton of replay ability with the introduction of expert mode, and the game has a ton of secrets that even after 10 hours your likely to have found less than half. It also plays similar to most rpg's where you must get to certain point in the game to unlock secret passages in previous missions, which allows the user to play the areas again but this time with more attention to detail. Would 10/10 recommend"
1891,"10/10 game, even better on shrooms"

1897,"This game is a classic. Never gets old.
(Most of my hours were spent on the Xbox 360 so I don't have much here lol)

I don't even have to explain what this game is. If you don't know by now, you must've been living under a rock since 2008. So I'll just list off some things I love about the game because why not.
• Music is still phenomenal.
• Gameplay hasn't aged a day.
• Low price, easy to get some friends into.
• Stays fun for multiple playthroughs.
• Comedy.
• Couch Co-op. I love couch co-op (Online is good too besides the little bit of input delay)
• Insane mode for all you psychopaths out there who crave maximum difficulty

Love this game 11/10"
1898,Great
1899,"Fun, , ,..,

1916,Pog game. Hack and Slash. The first playthrough is easy enough for small children. Insane mode is hard enough to be gratifying even after a few hundred hours in the game.

1919,"old but still a very good game, even better with friends"

1942,"yes
"
1943,"Played this game multiple times through on Xbox and PC. There really isn't anything wrong with it.
It's meant for multiple people to play together, it has a decent story, the game play is repetitive but not boring, the areas are all separately themed, etc.
It's just worth playing."

This game still goes strong even today."

1981,"I've played this way back on my older console, the Xbox 360. I even decided if I should get this again but on something different, and so I did. First off, I must say I've definitely felt nostalgia while playing it the first few minutes and then it became more entertaining later on so it feels the same from years back which I really love. The reasons why this game is one of my favorites is because the art style, humor, genre, and designs. What's even crazier, I am starting to lose a little bit of interest into games but this is the one I will never lose interest in. Truly, has to be one of the best games I've played."
1982,"I had to high expectations.
The game is really good designed, but the camera perspective and the control in general aren´t that good. THey make the game harder than it should be.
But im still enjoying it."
1983,absolutely astonishing game in multi and single player
1984,gord
1985,"Co-op ludo. For the multiplayer aspect alone this deserves a recommendation, but It's seriously kind of a bleh game on its own if I'm being honest. Not bad, not terribly bad, just the epitome of bleh. Even more so when you consider other beat 'em ups. 

[b][u]Recommended[/u][/b], for co-op only. Otherwise play something else."
1986,nice
1987,"At first, the game was relatively fun. Honestly, the game got old after a while, though. It's repetitive and boring after you play enough.

However, when I played the game in multiplayer for the first time, it was a completely different experience. The game is way more fun with friends, and for that I recommend it."

1997,"Honestly what can't castle crashers fix. This game could save your broken marriage, cure cancer, destroy a few countries, and more. This game is a must have. My wie was going to leave me and take all my money, I showed her this game and she instantly changed her mind. This game is how Joe Biden got elected and is run by the illuminati. This game brought my family back to lie and cured cancer in all of africa."

2044,This is my favorite hack n slash on the market. There is an abundance of gameplay here. There is so many things to collect and discover.
2045,.
2046,it's fun with friends
2047,"I have played this game a bunch. Not just on pc but as a kid and just in general on the xbox. Everytime I pick it up it's a blast for a while. The multiplayer adds to the game and with each friend that joins the enjoyment only goes up. While it is a simplistic side scroll beat em up, theres probably more charm and effort put into this game and its art than most games I play to date. It's always a good time to revisit every now and then.
I stream at twitch.tv/duksoup :)"
2048,also cool and makes you feel like you're in 2013

2068,"Behemoth's cult classic.

Story:

In Castle Crashers you pick one of the few knights available at your disposal and go on a quest to recover a magic crystal from an evil mage and also save princess he kidnapped too. Castle Crashers is not a story driven game, it has a story, but it's told through the visual medium and even then it's mostly focused purely on gameplay instead of anything else, so don't expect any heavy storytelling here. 

The comedy is the only thing I can take issue with here. It's charming, but it's mostly fart humor that at first funny quickly loses it's charm because it's insanely overused, however it helps the other funny moments land much better, because you just encounter a joke that didn't involve feces.

Graphics:

Grow up with the newgrounds flash style ? Well then Castle Crashers is going to be one hell of a treat for you. Visually it's a very good looking game. Plenty of vibrant and popping colors mixed with great environments and enemy designs, it's honestly very fun to just look around while you're slicing and dicing your enemies. 

It has this mixture of very simplistic art style, something you could have easily drawn when you were a kid and yet slightly more complex than that. Animations and everything are really big in scale and are just a visual feast, sometimes even too much. In certain levels visually there's too many things going on and it makes paying attention that much harder and could easily get you killed.

Audio:

Castle Crashers soundtrack is a collection of up beat tunes that really help make each fight you get into a really awesome experience. it goes from slower tempo to faster and it helps match each situation perfectly, especially when you go from the regular level to a boss fight,

The other sound effects are fine. They work fine for what they try to achieve, however they do have that slightly low quality that I associate with newgrounds flash animation, yet they aren't as low quality as that. They're nothing all too special, however I do have to give them props to making a lot of them really satisfying to hear, like the level up sound and if you played as the Blacksmith the frog summon.

Gameplay:

Castle Crashers is a very lite RPG, beat'em'up. You play on a 2D plain and go from left to right and beating anyone that pops up into a pulp, with your arsenal of weapons, animal orbs and combo moves. So first of all let's cover the positives cause I feel like there's more positives instead of negatives.

The gameplay is mostly really fun and it's just super fun to slash into your enemies, especially the more you level up and more powerful weaponry is at your disposal and the damage numbers go up higher and higher, not to mention the perfect difficulty since you get your ass kicked just the right amount to really not get sick of playing and if you die and get sent back into the level select you just want to get back into it right away. 

However the game is not without it's faults. I did say the combat works fine enough for the most part, however there are moments where the hitboxes feel incredibly inconsistent and this is mostly in boss fights where the boss is roughly similar in size to you. Often then not it feels like your hits don't land and just go somewhere else and it becomes infuriating fast when you keep swinging at a boss and just miss every swing for no reason. 

Also I played through the entire game in co-op and I found that the text often is placed behind your character portraits and you have to move away so you can read what the characters are saying which I found incredibly annoying, especially in the moments where I want to compare stats for weapons and my portrait gets in the way of that.

The game is pretty decent in length, roughly 5 hours or so to complete all of it and there's plenty of other modes to mess around with like a mini game where you try to avoid enemies by moving around them, a fighting arena to fight your friends or endless enemies or even go back to the main campaign and play on Insane difficulty to really test your skills.

Verdict:

Castle Crashers while not my favorite beat'em'up of all time, is still an absolute blast and I could see why it become such a cult classic. It's so much fun that you don't look at the flaws and just want to keep going and see how much stuff you can unlock. Even with it's shortcomings it's well worth the time. 

Final Rating:
8.5/10

Pros:
+ Great art style 
+ Catchy soundtrack
+ Gameplay is really fun

Cons:
- Hit detection is not the best
- The fart humor gets tiresome fast 
- Reading dialogue/weapon stats in co-op is a nightmare

(And yes did my friend gift this to me but it was great fun to play and now I only have about 3 achievements left to do!)"

2123,"After all these years still such a great game. I played this game for the first time on the PS-3 when i was just a kid. I had this best friend who always came over to play it with me locally since that was a thing back then. Oh how we played the game hours on end. It was also while playing this game when i ate my very first pop-tart. Anyway, after becoming a ""PC gamer"" and my PS-3 dying i re-bought it on this platform years later. Just for the good times it gave me back then. But after playing it for a little bit i do have to say it is much more fun to play with a friend locally than online. Because first of all the peak players count at time of writing is ""314"" Now even when you find somebody to play with the chances that they have already played it through and have a character of level 99 is pretty high. My advise is: get a controller compatible with steam, call a friend you miss and just play this game locally. You will have a great time, maybe you can even call 3 friends, or 4. Because this is a great party game too. Just boot it up and start smashing buttons it ain't even that hard to learn. Now if you do choose to play it online with a friend that works too. But just the feeling of a friend being present in the same room as you play together just gives a great feeling. Anyway you also don't get bored that easily as there are a lot of things to unlock. Anyway, this review doesn't really explain why you should get the game fully, its more like my experience how i grew up with it and such. I am well aware that this review may have been a waste of time to read and i'm sorry if it did. 

Thank you for listening, have a good one."

2165,"I love the concept of this game as well as the functionality and the animations and designs, however if you were to try to get 100% in achievements it would take too long because a lot of the players are level 99 or they used hacks/exploits to kill you instantly, (And as if you were trying to get the Medic! achievement you cannot because the hacker has too much health and cannot die and on top of this factor you need a total of 4 online players (If you got nobody to play with) The game it self is really short and I think that the only way to beat the arenas if you do juggling because the enemy's move too fast and since for the last wave there is 10 enemy's it is quiet difficult because if you stay still for not even a second you get instant killed.
Other than though I love the game alot and I would recommend it."

2192,"Not pictured; 50+ hours in the game on Xbox 360.

Castle Crashers finds its roots in Newgrounds. If you are old enough to know what that means, then you should be wise enough to have already played Castle Crashers. For everyone else, Castle Crashers is a side-scrolling beat'em up ala Double Dragon or Streets of Rage. You hack and slash your way through various enemies and bosses across all manner of environments with a differently colored knight that has some sort of gimmick that makes it different from all of the other differently colored knights. The game is graphically simple in way that lends well to the themeing of the game with a killer soundtrack to boot. The game is hilarious and stupidly simple, an absolute staple of 4-player coop and couch coop. If you have never played the game, it is an easy 100% recommend. Dust off your metallic 360 controller, crack open a cold one, and crank your way through this timeless classic with a buddy or two!"
2193,"I'm not great at this game, but I enjoy it."
2194,i love this game it's so fun
2195,Beat the game with blue knight and get Industrialist. Best character. Highest in the tier list. (Along with fencer if you're a turbo nerd.)
2196,"Full of black humor, knights humor, princess humor, bloody humor... c'mon humor lovers, c'mon!
Great as a party game too!"
2197,"This game is so good! I played with this on my console but i had to buy it on steam and I love it!
The story line is good but if you max out one character this can be boring.The solution to moving your character or abilities has often resulted in a very cool finish!

I recommend it to everyone, it is enough to play a oneshot!
This game is my childhood and on my console i have 200+ hours because I played it with my friend."

2313,"I spent many hours on Castle Crashers in my childhood on the Xbox 360. I've done that once again with the PC version, which is the best version of it. The gameplay is simple on paper but there's a very high ceiling for reflexive skill and complexity, and a large amount of replayability. There is a decent number of levels but the quality of the level design is what makes them still fun dozens of replays later. I recommend Castle Crashers to literally any gamer."
2314,"buy it on sale, then it's a steal"
2315,This game has been in my childhood for ages and I have kept playing it on and off since then. Not a lot of replay-ability but a fun adventure non-the-less. Very hard.
2316,very good :)

2322,"Let's be honest. You've probably already played this game and you just wanna get it for nostalgia, or to play with your friends. Either way it's a fun game and it's usually like 3 dollars. Just get it lol."

2335,brings me back to my fetus days

2337,"big funni, good gameplay, 6.9 hours, would play again, 9 clowns out of 10."
2338,"fun game, kind of disorienting and hard sometimes, bring freinds and but when on sale controllers make the game better and if you have siblings just plug in more controllers"
2339,If you like a good beat em' up game then this is perfect for you.
2340,"Pretty short game which is fun to play local coop with a friend. Has controller support. There are some annoying mechanics and the item system is a bit cumbersome, yet it has its fun points too. 7/10 for some arcade action. Do not expect a Rayman or Crash type fungasm tho."
2341,"This is an amazing game that gives a fair challenge, but doesn't feel too unfair. But, I would suggest using a controller, as the keyboard binds are painful to use."
2342,this game is the best
2343,"very fun game to play with friends
"
2344,A fun classic that's the right amount of challenging to where it's not impossible but tons more fun and easier with friends.
2345,hands down this game was my childhood 10/10
2346,GOAT
2347,got this game on console years ago and its even more fun with the dlc heroes. art style is something i'll never get tired of and its just fun to run through with friends. def recommend to anyone trying to have a good time.
2348,"the deer pooping itself is silly, i rode it btw"
2349,Buy this if you loved the old NewGrounds humor back in the day!
2350,God game
2351,game good. buy
2352,"Nothing needs to be said. This game was great when it came out and its still great. played it when i was like 13 or something with my friend who had it. We unlocked everything and played through it a few times. 

If the developers ever read this just know that I know you know how to make a good game. You know how to make a game fun. Not many people know how to do that then execute it let alone everything is basically perfect...Still surprised we never got a Castle Crashers 2. Or a different variant of the game like a dark gritty souls type game or something (basically). 

10/10 My 5 year old plays it and he can handle the mechanics and stuff he basically dies alot more than me and stuff but yeah THIS GAME IS GREAT FOR KIDS (not that kids should be playing video games....wait till they're 10-15yrs old honestly and dont let them play it too much. you've been warned)"

вспомнить мне о ней нечего, но точно помню, что скучно не было)"
2492,one of the best soundtracks in a video game to date
2493,"I've been playing this game ever since it initially came out on the xbox 360. I've recently finished beating insane mode on all 31 characters, got them all to 99, finished with the last of my achievements, got all of the weapons, and animal orbs. I've had the privilege of having a brief back and forth with Real Faction the composer for the necromancer theme ""A Simple Sight."" This is probably my favorite beat em up of all time, and I learned by watching some of the best players such as cloud nine, and the number one record holder in the game if he's still there that is. I can't recommend this game to anyone enough. When I die, I want to be buried with a copy of this, and Super Mario World."
2494,best game 2d
2495,It is the perfect example of old but gold
2496,A classic masterpiece.
2497,"This is easily one of my favorite arcade style games. I personally believe this is a must-buy.

The story is that you are a knight partying when an evil wizard steals your kingdom's hilariously over sized power crystal and four princesses, you are requested to retrieve everything stolen.

Cons
-Getting caught in a damage knockdown loop sucks

Pros
-The humor is great
-Every knight possesses a different element of magic, which do different effects
-Boss Fights and Mini-Boss Fights are abundant and quite fun
-A level-up system that is so simple and supplements your playstyle
-Many different weapons that help your playstyle
-Pets with a different effect per a pet, that give stat bonuses, find random items, have a combat ability, or just help you level up
-Fair checkpoints
-Play Co-op and have a blast (also makes it where you don't need to worry about dying)

Again, I highly recommend picking this game up. Definitely a diamond with Battleblock Theater."
2498,"This game is very fun, although it is more difficult to beat without other players. It's a great game, I've enjoyed it for hours on end."

If i were to rate it out of 10, it would have to be a ten but thats just my opinion because its very nostalgic to me and i love beat

2573,"When I think of the year 2008, it is definitely not Castle Crashers, My friend held me at gunpoint to buy this game, just so he could a nostalgia high. Well news flash... this game is the opposite of nostalgia, in fact this game is ass. When I think of 2008, I think of Lego Indiana jones, or Ben 10 alien force. Not this p**** a** Sh*t. I am now in my room depressed knowing that I have wasted 19 minutes of my life on this abomination of a game. 0/10"
2574,shat my pants when the big black man burst through the door
2575,I couldn't crash the castle in time :(
2576,great game i've had it on my xbox 360 for years and decided to get it on steam and it's been a great time reliving this game.something i think they should add though is if you complete an arena it gives you money other than that runs really smoothly and is just a great game. if you have the money you should buy the game and if someone you know has the game do co op with them that's also really fun. and also the mini games are fun (rip all you can quaff though).

2586,"Great game, especially if you're into fighting type of games with different levels. This game is very cartoony with a bunch of weapons and magic attacks, with different characters. When you're first brought into this game you will see a colorful menu when playing you can play with friends, keep in mind this is a multiplayer game but can be played solo, this game also recommends a controller. So after loading up a match in the ""story mode"" you will be brought into a menu to select your character. These characters very from base characters, to unlocked characters, and even DLC characters, which are definitely not needed to beat the game. Once your characters is selected you will be brought into a 2D world with enemies attacking your king, which will begin your adventure versing bosses, mini bosses, and normal enemies. The ""Story mode"" isn't the only game mode available, I'm not sure but I think there are 2 other game modes to select. This game is great with friends, and if you're into 2D battle games with bosses, almost like Cuphead but more ""Dungeon Quest"" type genre. 10/10 Enjoy this game a lot with my friend."

2647,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."

2674,"This game is actually pretty good, the thing it's that sometimes games obligates you to level up to defeat the next boss. Sometimes it's just a: Kill all the enemys. Win the level. But if we are talking about graphics, they're too good and the details just make it better. 7/10. A good game, but gets boring with the time."

But we finished it with full of joy and great laugh at.... Very recommended to play with friends and families or siblings."
2744,"A spastic ADHD-fueled bullshit festival where you can barely tell what's going on on screen half the time, and the AI relies on cheap shots and BS to cheese you to death.  Controls are laggy and clunky.  A real disappointment from the same company that came out with Battleblock Theater and Pit People, which were amazing.  This is garbage.  I'd rather get kicked in the dick than play this again."

2765,I wish they would have made a sequel to this game. It was a perfect game from release date. I remember playing this game on xbox 360 for hours. The graphics on this game were always appealing and even though its pretty old it holds up very well and in my opinion is the best game of its genre. If you find a better game in this genre PLEASE let me know I will purchase it immediately.

2791,"Castle Crashers is a timeless classic, and a necessary purchase for anyone who plays multiplayer games. For just a couple of bucks, you can't go wrong with this purchase, and it's frequently on sale too!

I can't thank this game enough for the conversations and content its given me, as there's been numerous times I've added a new gaming friend and found myself picking this title up as the game we first traverse through. 

It is accessible for anyone, with fluid controls on any input, and ZERO lag regardless of your friends' specs or location. Castle Crashers is multiplayer gaming at its finest. It doesn't feel dated at all, and honestly, you can repeat the story countless times and not remember a singular thing---I don't know what it is about this game, but you'll be several off-topic stories deep with your friends while mindlessly button mashing. 

Achievements are relatively easy to obtain and if playing the game only once, it's not too long of a ride. No achievements are hardlocked or truly missable, as everything's replayable by map selection. DLC is purely optional and gives additional character options, but you'll definitely want to pick them up. From my memory there's only one achievement that requires you to play with others, and that's for a full party achievement. There is also an additional minigame one can play whenever, without ever touching the base game, and I found that completing that one was much easier in multiplayer. 

Highly recommended."

2815,Very fun with friends and has its 2010's charm. Blacksmith is my favorite character! Best to get during sales where it's $3-5 so you can get a few copies for your besties.
2816,"Best indie title you'll ever play. It's got 20+ hour content, great story telling, a lot of actual funny jokes, and a lot of characters to chose from. You'll never play another game like this."
2817,"This game saved my life.

I am 38.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

2903,"One thing I want to make clear from the get go is that I don't like this game at all because of how the enemies do things and just the weird keyboard controls. If you get this make sure to have friends to play it with that was the only time I could do anything in game without getting hit by 50 billion bombs and arrows that kept me grounded and unable to move. In conclusion don't play this game in singleplayer because it is too much of a clusterfuck to actually play by yourself, but if you have friends sure it is a fun game to play."
2904,"As a kid, this and Minecraft were my first XBox games. Originally i had just played wii games, mario and all that. I vaguly recall playing the Ice Knight first, with my 3 siblings, and just working together to ""Get the Gals"". Ive played through it again on XBox One, and now for the 5th time on PC. Can say: Keyboard controls are ASS."

2907,"Without any kind of nostalgia, just a pretty good coop game from the 360 era. 

A low system requirements, fancy graphic style, pretty fun and easy combat system, and ability to have nice time with your friends. Everything that needed to just have good times with your friends. 

So, recommend on sale, with like some procents off. 
And later will be some in debt review of some aspects of game. 

1) Visual Style. Pls, give game a try, without judging by pretty creepy design of some enemies. Main thing is gameplay and fun with friends, and there are a lot of this things
2) Combat System. You will learn it as you play, and at the end the enemies will be a lot stronger, and you will have skill to properly compete with them.

The controls are normal.Not unique or difficult, but sometimes I struggled with the depth of the levels and wasn't on the same level as the enemies and just beat the air.
That didn't take away from my enjoyment of the game though and I highly recommend it."

2977,"9/10

Very replayable co-op side scrolling beat em up.
In fantasy, medieval world. drawn in a timeless hand drawn art style, you fight with 1-4 players thru a never stale landscape in the search of four princesses.

The music goes hard first off, on top of that there is an awesome game to play!
There are four skills: Strength / Defense / Magic / Agility
You can find pets throughout the levels that help you in a variety of ways, with the limit of one at a time.
Tools also come up throughout the first play thru of the campaign, that you can use on earlier levels to find secret items.
The progression has you always upgrading a skill and coming back to levels to try to it with new pets, items, and characters, which also have different magic abilities.
I played it by myself with Castle Crashers on my Xbox 360 on my flatscreen TV and Malcom in the Middle on Netflix on my Wii on my CRT TV next to it for hours as a kid.
This game is a completion-ist's best friend with so much to do and stuff to unlock and max out, but even if you don't do all that, its worth just one play thru, even if by yourself.

There are also some other side modes that are just so much fun in multiplayer, not as much solo.

2978,"this game is great ive been playing it on my xbox for 3 years solid and i love it because of how many pets, weapons, and characters there are its great and you should totally play it and get it it is great"

2980,"I've owned Castle Crashers since it came out on XBox 360 well over a decade ago. Since then, I've sired three kids that are all now Castle Crashers fans, with their own copies of the game that they play online with friends, so mine is a family where Castle Crashers is a multi-generational bond and a meme unto itself. This PC version helps keep the game from aging, and let's face it - I will own this game on every console it is ever released for that I ever possess. It is simply not an option to NOT have access to my beloved Knights and their quest."

I am going to focus on what i did like and what i didn't so that may help you decide how to approach the game. But as a intro, lets say that I don't think this game will ever lose it's fans. It is a well made hack, slash, cast magic game that supports COOP and any age can enjoy it. Once you learn it, it is very fun and if you want a challenge you can select the insane mode which is ... pretty much insane.

So, lets get to the points. The positive are:

- It is very easy to learn and understand it. The mechanics are simple.
- It is possible to speedrun it within a few hours.
- It supports COOP (for me that is important)
- After you finish it, you can play it again
- It has low requirements, so it can easily run to old laptops etc.
- It is very hard to master. This is good, because the game has depth regarding the combos you can do and how to combine them.

So what are the negative points? There are mainly two:

1) the XP/grinding system.
2) the saving system

You gain XP with each attack to a living target. So in order to gain a lot of XP you should NOT be efficient. By word efficient, i mean kill your opponents fast and effectively. The optimal strategy (excluding using glitches) for gaining XP is to be as weak possible so that a lot of strikes are needed to bring down an opponent. This is totally counter-intuitive.

You have to not use strong weapons because using them reduces the rate you level up. If you skip any kind of time-wasting grinding (I never grind) in a single run you can't level up fast. You will finish the game but your character will be kinda weak. So you can't play insane mode (a very challenging mode, very very hard but imho fun to play). So sooner or later you will have to either play previous maps again and again and again in order to level up or abuse glitches to save time. So to max out you need 114000 XP, that is 114000 key presses for only attacking for each character.

What about the saving system. The saving system is buggy. Well it is not really buggy, but the design is really bad. When you return to the game, the game reports ""game saved"" but you don't know what has been saved. So what it does not say is that not all maps are saved once completed. There are specific checkpoints that you have to complete in order for your progress to be saved. You have to search to the internet to find which missions are the checkpoints else if you log out all your progress is lost.

Another note about the saving system on the insane mode: On the previous to last mission on insane mode you have to kill the same minions again and again if you want to fight the boss (I think it is the Dark souls syndrome?). There is no way to save inbetween. That is super annoying because you have to practice a lot to beat the necromancer and for each try before even the fight begins you need to perform time consuming 20-30 juggles to minions). This should never be a part of good game design. (I don't think it was planned but anyway)

In spite of all the drawbacks, the game still worths it if you like this gerne.

But if you want to retry to beat the insame mode be prepared for a tough challenge.

3047,great game
3048,"good gam

3049,Best game ever made
3050,"This is a fourteen-year old beat em up/action RPG which has aged perfectly fine.
The co-op can be played both online and locally which is a huge plus.
The combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull out.
Well designed enemies and bosses.
The music is fantastic.
The campaign has a lot of replay value and is very rewarding in terms of loot. 
If this review hasn't convinced you to give this game a chance, try the demo and see it for yourselves. But to me this is one of the best indie games ever made."

3111,Crashed the castles with my girl. Great game.
3112,"After playing this for almost a year as a kid in 2010, I realized that I really enjoyed the 'arcade' style of The Behemoth development team. I have since bought all of their games based off of the reputation and my admiration for this game. 

I originally had it on my PS3 where I played 100+ hours with my family and friends. I have bought 5 or 6 copies of it on Steam to give to my friends so that they would join me in the awesome adventure. 

There are few games that have ever been able to give me the feeling that Castle Crashers does."

3128,"Get some Xbox controllers, grab some friends, and prepare for a lot of very stupid and mindless fun"
3129,It is a must-have game for everyone that I would suggest that you get with all of the DLC to get custom characters and all of them have different powers. While I might not have a lot of hours in the game I have played a lot more on ps3 and that is why I would say only real gamers have played Castle Crashers.
3130,Castle Crashers is a masterpiece.
3131,i wish more people played this because multiplayer is almost impossible. still one of the best games ever
3132,It's okay. Music slaps though. 7.5/10

3135,"Castle Crashers is a mixed bag but good for the most part. almost every new move/gimmick will prove to be somewhat useful at the bare minimum and each pet, weapon, stage and character adds both variety and diversity to the player. I do have some problems with the game consisting the balance of difficulty regarding the characters and enemies. I cant speak for all players but I personally had a difficult play session when not grinding out my character or picking one that's more op than the rest of the crew. fortunately grinding isn't too much of a hassle as long as you don't pour any stats into attack until the end. otherwise you're gonna be playing one big snore fest of a game. while the gameplay may not be exactly top notch, it still holds up and is forgiven by the music and art. the visual style of the game has a simplistic yet functional feel while sending the player down the path of memory lane (or at least if you were on Newgrounds or Flash during the earlier days of online content). the music is what I believe lifts this game up with each track being catchy and fitting to its respective stage but also nostalgic for the previously stated Newgrounds feel. while this game may have some setbacks and issues, id say that if you're into this type of stuff then its worth the trouble. 7/10"

We tried some fixes we found in the community guides of the game, none of which worked. 

Very disappointed as it did look like a fun game. Any suggestions on how to fix this issue are more than welcome as we can't even refund the game anymore..."

3274,legit just buy it
3275,The necromancer's theme is helluva banger!
3276,"ESSE JOGO É SIMPLESMENTE INCRIVEL.É um otimo jogo que realmente diverte, as vezes você se estressa com fazes dificeis , mas diverte muito esse jogo ainda mais jogando com amigos ainda mais porque tem outros personagens e o jogo é extremamente divertido fazendo o fator replay se tornar alto.Até as musicas são boas.A unica coisa que eu não achei ruim, mas alguns podem se incomodar é que, algumas fazes são meio dificeis então algumas pessoas podem não se divertir por causa disso, e tambem em algumas fazes você vai ter que upar de lvl por umas meia houra ou ficar fazenda tentativa e erro varias vezes, isso são coisas que podem incomodar certas pessoas, mas eu não me incomodei (:


SIMPLESMENTE 40 HORAS DE DIVERSAO :D"
3277,I played it with my dad. Just wish that the game had save slots
3278,I recommend this to other players because by yourself or with friends it's overall a good time. With friends you can laugh together as you attack waves and waves of enemies. The game may seem short at first but if you want to unlock every character it will take you while because to unlock a new character you have to beat the game as one character to unlock another. Every character unlocks a different character if you beat the game.
3279,YEAH
3280,"I PLAYED WITH FRIEND VERI FUN
"
3281,It is a very good game and the graphics get a 10/10 its just a perfect game for all ages 5 and above. The characters are really detailed and the elemental knights are rlly fun to play with y'know. And my favorite character is red knight & blue knight and lastly the necromancer! Oh and i rllllly hope people start playing more online multi cuz y'know the game is much more funner with 4 people then 1! So i hope you enjoy this game and this guide!
3282,When you played any of The Behemoth games you know they have their own kind of humor. Play it with friends you will have the fun of you're life with it.

3372,One of the best xbox 360 titles that i should really play more of.
3373,how do you make a game whats still enjoyable after like 8 years? be behemoth duh
3374,it good get it
3375,"It doesn't have a massive amount of content but if you have some friends to play with it's a great co-op game. I played it back on the 360 when it was on the store in the late 2000s, it still holds up."
3376,very nice
3377,Door go boom
3378,Me eat sammige. Me become big man. Me toss little man. Little man cry. Me laugh.
3379,You definitely crash the castles
3380,the game is very nice make penis hard
3381,not fundamentally groundbreaking but some psychoactive substances and a couple of friends make this game a very good time
3382,"Castle crashers very cul I played this when I was 3 years probably shouldn't have. But, GREAT GAME 10/10"
3383,"whoa, nice game."
3384,the soundtrack is rad and the gameplay is also fun! extra fun with friends!
3385,"I loved playing Castle Crashers on my Xbox 360 as a kid, and a couple days ago I was feeling nostalgic about it, and bought it. It's a little shorter than I remembered but it has other things to do to keep you playing, like collecting all playable characters and animal orbs, as well as Insane Mode, which I did not do as a child, and as an adult have been losing my mind. I've been addicted to playing it for a couple days, it's kept me busy. Online multiplayer can be a little buggy at times but with enough adjusting can work fine. Whether playing it alone or with a group of friends it's a great game."
3386,its pog

3446,iconic
3447,very much fun
3448,"Very fun game even with how old it is, I used to have it on console and could never really figure out a good review for it. Of course some jokes are crude and old humored, but it's good fun! Playing with friends makes it even better, either fighting each-other or the many different enemies. Of course some things could be criticized, but some don't need to be. With how much this game can give you, with the leveling afterwards, and it does technically have a new game plus.

Swag!
9.5/10"
3449,"great under rated game but, would recomend controler."
3450,"Amazing game, Owned this back around 2013 and grew up playing this on my xbox 360. Recently had the money to get this and it's still just as fun as it was back in 2013. The only reason i wouldn't recommend this game is if you don't have any friends who own this or don't have a spare controller for local co-op, as this game is much more fun with friends or family. The game does have a PvP matchmaking system using the arenas and a PvE multiplayer que for the main story with random people. To me the PvE matchmaking isn't as fun as playing with friends, but is a good substitute if you don't have anyone to play it with."
3451,Its a fun little game!
3452,gooda
3453,it is a really fun game an annoying part though is when there are bow spammers

3461,dis game is awesome buy it n0w
3462,yes
3463,"The bad: very repetitive and long game. Too difficult at times. Not always clear how to defeat a certain enemy.
What keeps you going: the animations are amazing, the different worlds and beautiful graphics kept me picking this game up each time."
3464,"fun addictive and honstely better than any game activision blizzard, or  ea  could ever play 
i would compare it to gta the definitive edition but it beats its ass too man times kinda unfair 

inconclusion buy if you want 
id recomend =)"
3465,Castle Crashers is a time tested Xbox game. the game is a simple hack and slash flash player style game with a goofy story & wacky artwork that give it an all around enjoyable experience. with its fast paced levels and simple controls it's a very easy game to play with friends who are quickly bored or not big video game fans.
3466,it was fun to beat up annoying river cat demon

3473,only time I get kisses in life :((
3474,"Such a great beat em' up! I play this with my 3 kids. I focused mainly on defense so that I could run around and revive them whenever they got knocked out. I only wish the game was longer, but I got it on sale and it was well worth it. And there plenty of things to unlock. My only beef with the game is that apparently it can occasionally erase all your progress. That happened to us after we had unlocked about 5 characters, which was a real bummer."
3475,"it's not a mistake its a masterpiece

3521,i remember a lot of my friends playing this game back on 360 but never bought it myself. i saw it on sale on steam and decided to give it a try. i immediately regretted not buying it back in the day or getting it sooner. it is a very fun casual game with loads of characters to continuously play through many times to level up. its fun with friends or by yourself and i would recommend it for anyone looking for a casual game to just pass the time
3522,"who do you call when thertes a princess in troble?

This game is a classic, I used to play this all the time on my Xbox 360 and this isn't one of those games where you finish it and replay it and it doesn't become fun anymore. No matter how many times I play this game I still have fun and I also suck at playing games without friends but this game is still so so fun by myself. I love this game still to this day, but anyways I hope you liked my review and I hope you will see this and go play the game yourself because I love this game so much."
3578,"good
"
3579,YES
3580,my game crashed when i tried to crush the castle
3581,"Whenever i think i'm done playing Castle Crashers i always somehow come back to it, it's just a game i always have fun playing; Even if i know all the levels, all the enemies, all the strategies, all the abilities and furthermore, it's always a fun game to play especially with friends. The style is so recognizable and so rich, the levels are so alive and the designs are a chef's kiss of the Newgrounds era which i slightly grew up in, it never turns into a tired game to replay in my opinion.

One of the most fun things about this game is how acessible it is, you can just go to any server you are in and you'll most likely find anyone who's up for some Castle Crashers, it's a very light game and a lot of people own it, a very high number of players online also play it, and it is just truly a happiness to see for such a enriched beautiful game as this.

Keep on Castle Crashin' everyone!"
3582,"its good game to play alone and with ur friends and you enjoy it fast

and its very fun an enjoyable - i recommend you to play it"
3583,I bet the clown girl clussy goes hard

3651,"As someone who played Castle Crashers on the Xbox 360, this was the most fun I've ever had revisiting a childhood game. Aswell as playing Battleblock Theatre with this, it was one of the best experiences I had during 2021. 11/10"
3652,"Pretty fun game, played on the xbox years ago with my dad and brothers. Gets repetitive but you can enjoy the game whenever because beating the game with one person unlocks another. Overall a great game and definitely recommend it."
3653,"Sound track is 10/10 gameplay is fun
"
3654,game fun with friend game alone not as bad
3655,ok
3656,good game
3657,beautiful
3658,join the kingdom on a quest to get these knights some coochie
3659,Muito bom e divertido de se jogar com amigos.
3660,This game is very fun and also it runs on low peformance computers so give it a try.
3661,I will spend hours playing Castle Chrashers is a awesome game if you dont have it I reccomend this game and the dlc and getting battle block theater so you can get all the fun variety of charecters and all there different magic powers.
3662,"This hands down is my favorite game that i have ever played rivaling games such as pokemon black, super marioworld, crash bandicoot 3, etc. This is on my lonely island game list. over and over again. the art development is amazing and perfectly suits the game and its theme. The game play is amazing with rare bugs that lean more to game exp glitches.
there is enough content in this game to keep you busy for a year with out a doubt. their is enough customization to your character that you will feel like you are able to make your own character. 

But most importantly its a FUN CHALLENGE. it is something you will fail out but have you giggly for hours about or bobbing your head to one of the best soundtracks to video game ever. This is my generations version of the games i will make sure my kids play. 

If you haven't played this beat 'em up - hack and slashy - brawler, what are you doing with your life?"

3675,"A beautiful combination of Cuteness and Violence! In comparison to BattleBlock Theater, this game is more combat-focused. The art and soundtracks are so cute and great. Like BattleBlock Theater, UI and UX are designed very beautifully and are easy to use. There is no dialogue in the game and it will leave everything on the backstory and progress details to the player's imagination! 

The combat system is very straightforward, as we level up our character new combos will be available in fights. Like every Co-op focused game, we can enjoy the game to the fullest while playing with friends or try to beat the game on our own through a more challenging campaign!

Even though the combat is very straightforward and reparative the amount of content in this game can make playing it so much fun. We have lots of places to be and several different enemies to fight. In addition to that, we have Bomb, Bow, power-up sandwiches, different kinds of weapons to use in combat, a shovel to dig out hidden items throughout the maps, and a cute Animal partner that will help us in battles.

Happy Gaming"
3676,this game is very fun to play.
3677,needs a number 2 game and it need more content and then it will get a thumb up. add more stuff and it will resieve a massive up vote from me
3678,"so very much cream
"
3679,its fun
3680,"Pro: 
 + Very fun Coop Game
 + Variety of abilities
 + Many different weapons to chose
 + The Story is kinda weird but one of the funniest Stories

Contra:
 - Sometimes the Fighting was a bit weird
 - no Major Contras"
3681,"eh not for me. I didn't play much mostly cause one of my friends bought it for me and i just played when they did but personally i didn't like it much. For one its hard to see who you are on the screen, the combat is just basic hack and slash, and theirs way to many bathroom jokes. great for kids i guess but can reccemend to anyone else."

3712,"its a fun game and I've enjoyed this on the Xbox and i was very happy to see it on steam. I bought it, and instantly started playing. The nostalgia hit different. It hit me like a truck, the memories of my getting back from school and hopping on my Xbox 360, and playing with my brothers or friends online. It just felt right."

3724,"red knight said i should kill myself


11/10 

"
3725,better with friends
3726,"I'm almost 10 years late I guess but, I love this game!!

It's definitely not an easy game to play solo, so I'd recommend playing it with friends. It's a co-op game 100%.

I'm halfway through the game on an abandoned co-op run, and I think with some grinding it can be done solo. So buyer beware, I wouldn't expect a super single-player friendly experience.

Otherwise, I bought the 2 DLC Knights for more weapons & characters because I didn't realize how many characters & weapons were in the game. I figured it's 4 different colored knights and swords but SURPRISE it's like 20+ characters I'm seeing and looks like nearly 50 weapons so... recommended!!!"
3727,"Solid hours of game play.

Pros:
Fun with friends
Will keep you awake
Funny

Cons:
hard if you are soloing
Story could be more (Perhaps an dlc expansion)

Hope devs can add more to this game in terms of stories. its very solid.

8/10
"
3728,This is a fun action game. I recommend it.
3729,"This game's been around since 2008, and to this day it still manages to stay fun. 

The combat is easy to pick up, Dan Paladin's art style is fantastic, the soundtrack is amazing, and it's an absolute blast to play with friends. It may be a short game (around 10 hours), but it has tons of replayability due to the sheer amount of characters and weapons. Castle Crashers is one of the best beat ‘em ups of all time in my opinion.

 I've managed to put 120+ hours into this game. Needless to say, buy this game right now."

3740,"I have played this game way more than I have any right to. Some aspects of it are certainly dated, and the gameplay is nothing spectacular, but it is still a fun and colorful beat 'em up. Also has local multiplayer, which is obviously a plus, but it also very fun playing singleplayer. Worth picking up if you can find it on sale."

3764,"I played through the normal story mode in one sitting of approximately seven hours. 
Here is why.
Castle Crashers is lots of fun. 
Despite its age it holds up very well and in my opinion, this game should be on the list of games everybody needs to play before they die.
The game is challenging, but never unfair.
The levels look all very different and there are lots of surprises, so you will never get bored playing this.
The base game is kind of short, but there is tons of replay value.
I also really like the overall feel of the game.
The story, the gameplay, the characters, everything is just a little over the top.
It blends together into a weird, funny action-adventure, which will keep you engaged from start to finish."
3765,"A friend gifted me this game for us to play together. It's fun, atleast when you aren't getting pummeled by every single enemy in the game."
3766,me when the bruh
3767,"Amazing game, play it countless times on XBOX 360, XBOX 1, and on PC. Some achievements are silly but definitely possible so not a bad game to achievement hunt. Definitely not for everyone, but still a lovely game."

3782,"Its a great game to play together and its lots of fun when you are playing with friends. But the gameplay is quite simple and can get boring when you are alone and many of the bosses are creative by design but frustrating or boring to fight against.
The artstyle is simply great and it makes the game funnier.
I especially like that you fight for the princesses which is a fun surprise and it brings a lot of dynamic and exitement when you are playing with friends.

9/10 -- with friends      6/10 -- alone"

3796,Amazing classic game
3797,"Absolutely one of the best games around, I can't wait for the new Alien Hominid! Keep up the amazing work guys!"
3798,I play this game for the puzzles
3799,A fun game .Gets repetitive after a bit but hey this game released in 2012. Good nostalgia moment and i think for the time of the release i wouldve rated it a good 7 out of 10 if not more but with what we got in the recent years this style of game gets less and less appreciated and less used. Bugs are minor atleast in my playthroughs and not game changing. Would recommend if it is on sale and want to relive the glory days. Now kids go play Fortnite and spend 100$ on skins but this is a masterpiece for the xbox 360 and for its time. For the price compared to me buying Cyberpunk and only getting 9  hours of play time bc most AAA games are dissapointing too. This game is really not dissapointing. For today standard i would recommend trying it out but afterward go back to your regular game
3800,It's really fun
3801,"I played this game more hours on my Xbox, I'm a fan of this game for sure"
3802,no
3803,"This game is funny, Interesting, difficult, and you can play with others.
This game is long so it will be hard to get bored and if you try finding secrets, you can unlock any creature in the entire game!"
3804,nice game
3805,Good game
3806,goated
3807,"This isn't a game it's a lifestyle. I first touched the almighty Castle Crashers at the age of ten from that moment on I was addicted. Beating the game with the main characters, then moving on to their evolution. This masterpiece was everything I wanted as a little gamer. Now as an adult I still love this game... Some will say the game gets boring but have never beat it in insane mode. The first game my kids will touch on the computer is the almighty Castle Crashers. Long story short I will forever be a fan of this game."
3808,"The visual style is appealing and fun to look at. It has this old Newgrounds charm that is so iconic. Gameplay is also very solid - good old beat em' up with some RPG elements like upgrading stats and getting better weapons. Lots of characters to choose from and they all have their own quirks. If you have friends to play with, even better."

3824,"This game is a complete joke.
  -This game is not for kids, due to its insane difficulty.
  -This game has complete garbage instructions.
  -This game has 0 balance on Xp and Money.
  -This game has complete garbage gameplay.
  -Mobs or bosses health doesnt change based on amount of players( Which means that 
   playing in full team of 4 players will make this game 10x easier, because there is no 
   balance )
  
  Dont waste your money or time on this garbage it wont get fun or good at any point.
  You just Spam 2 buttons at every mob or boss.
  
This game has to be a joke and the Good reviews are 100% jokes or bots.

Anybody who finds this game fun must be a perma virgin with no friends and a complete clown."

3827,"Been playing this game since 2010 on the Xbox 360. This game is GREAT with friends, and will bring years of fun. This game only takes a day or so to beat playing normally, but the experience always changes each time you restart. This game was my childhood."
3828,"good 
"
3829,"If you wanna talk about classic gems from the 360 days, you gotta bring up Castle Crashers. What a great game, gameplay wise, and visually. It was cool how back in the day you could just make cool quirky little indie games like this, and have people just bombard it with support. I remember playing this as a kid with my uncle on the 360, and here I am nowadays getting it again and beating it again, remembering everything along the way. I think this is one of the perfect party games you can get to play with friends. All of the knights are pretty cool, and their dlc knights are badass. They had multiple game modes as well, which not a lot of indie games were doing at all. The soundtrack is amazing, there's multiple play styles and pets you can have, there's unique weapons with differing stats, it's honestly just an amazing indie game from the past. If you haven't gotten the game yet and beaten it, I'd say to give it a go. It's not that long of a game with some replay value as well. It even gives you the option after killing the boss, to battle with your friends, to see who is getting the girl at the end of the level. 360 days were the best, and games like this bring back some of those memories."
3830,Awesome! Co-op Amazing!

3835,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
3836,"absolutely great game, classic and hours of fun with friends, shocking achievements though but the game play and fun makes up for it!!"
3837,A classic Xbox 360 and PS3 game you can play with friends that still holds up to this day!

3841,"Castle Crashers is mega POG. Hourless fun, tons to do and unlock. But did you know...?
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped in to a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold."

3863,it is a lot of fun
3864,yes
3865,yes
3866,"After a few hours of playing the game with my son (who has played very few games thus far), my take is that the games easy enough to learn but hard to master. Definitely recommend it for casual couch co-op. You're left to your own devices to figure out what leveling up certain stats actually does and how xp is gained, so I'm certain there's room for min-maxing, but at this point in the game (at least for us) you could throw your points anywhere and be successful if you respect the mechanics of the bosses and their associated trash, Highly recommend, especially at the price point."
3867,fart knight
3868,fun multypayer!!! :)
3869,literally if you haven't played this game yet i don't trust you
3870,"SO THE NOSTALGA From Xbox was insane Love this game'


GET THIS GAME PLS"
3871,"A fun and little game for a fun and little time. It's great for shooting the breeze with buddies and wasting away the hours until you need to go get shit done, son."
3872,"you don't need to hear from me why you should get this game.

just get it, you won't regret it :)"
3873,"Castle Crashers will always be a classic and a great game. That being said, it is old, and get's repetitive fast. It's best enjoyed with friends, so if it's on sale and you buy 4 copies for you and some friends, or have some friends come over and you play on the couch, you'll definitely have a great time!

(My friend gifted me the steam version, but i have it on ps3, xbox 360, and the remaster on xbox 1)"
3874,Not fun
3875,"A classic. Even better with friends, 10/10. If you don't have friends or your friends can't afford this bc they're broke, then know that online is dead and you'll have to play singleplayer. You could ask around discord servers though"

3955,my childhood <3
3956,The Democratic Party of The United States has been defeated once and for all. So long.
3957,this game pog shart. very artificial. yes indeed :emoji:
3958,"Theme wasn't for me, but the technical issues are pretty bad, too.
The theme is a bit childish, but I could see how it would be better enjoyed by friend-groups or children. That's my problem, not the game's.
Despite the fact I didn't care for the theme, I'm writing this because of the technical issues. Castle Crashers is broken with Windows Display Scaling on high resolution monitors, and I'm just not invested enough to find out if it's fixable. The attack mechanics in the game are also very sensitive to character position. if your character is farther from the camera than the enemy, you'll miss. Too close? you'll still miss.

Overall, it's ok to play on a 1080p monitor with a younger group of 4, but adult co-op on a 4k TV was pretty awful."
3959,this game is a game where you play the game to get better at the game to eventually afk the game to get even better at the game which  eventually gets boring because your too good at the game

4017,Bought this for 1 buck. Expected a brain-dead game to pass the time. Got destroyed instead. Good fun to play with friends.
4018,I feel like the fact that my profile picture has been grey knight for over a year speaks for itself.

4033,"just get it! i hesitated for years now. im wishing i got this game a long time ago. this game freakin rips. the art style is awesome. the progression is straight grind heavy,ugh. but the unlocks seem sweet. devs you guys absolutely crushed it outta this universe. this is one of those completely perfect games like sotn,super metroid,hollow knight,etc. i hope this title has brought the devs millions. they deserve it. hey devs.... can you please use this same type of game but make it a western style , and another version in cyberpunk style with robots n stuff. you guys are amazing!"
4034,IT was good but bought it in pack so had to return it

"
4093,my nostalgia for game is immeasurable
4094,"This game did not live up to all of the nostalgia filled love that many people have expressed for it. It is an enjoyable game, if you have someone to play through it with, but it’s extremely simple and repetitive. The humor is kinda childish and not my cup of tea, but some of the jokes stuck the landing for me. The art style is pretty good and it’s pretty iconic and it is representative of the Xbox 360 days, as with the rest of behemoth’s games. I cannot stress enough how much better this game is when you have someone to go through it with! Me and one of my best friends played through it and HOLY HELL, it made an experience that would have been boring and tedious into a pretty enjoyable game. It isn't much more than dumb fun, but that’s really all it needs to be. I recommend it, but only if you have a friend to play it alongside."
4095,If you're questioning why this game is so cheap: don't. Just get this game.
4096,nice game
4097,ive played this game for years and i have loved every second
4098,Good game
4099,I hit the man with Broccoli and it makes me happy.
4100,Is Good
4101,its good
4102,"Amazing game, love the story and all the secrets. Would love a part 2"
4103,yes.
4104,"This game is super tedious, but I guess it's okay. There are better co-op beat 'em ups on Steam, though. Infected Shelter is infinitely better than this, check it out."
4105,"The best 15 (or 3, if there's a sale) dollars you will ever spend."
4106,one of my favorite games. i would sacrifice my life if it meant i never started my insane mode run though. seriously.
4107,literally my childhood...10/10
4108,"probably one of the greatest games made of all time, every knight is so much fun, probably some of the best replayability through all of the different knights, literally just get it, shocked you havent already!!!!"

4140,AMAZING GAME OVERALL
4141,they made me kiss a fucking clown!!!!!
4142,A classic
4143,"Still a banger as it always is, hope there is some way to make this game be able to be modded so it can get more stuff to let me play with, just a thought."
4144,"One of my favorite games alongside TF2 and G'sM!
It's really silly i mean look at all the jokes and gags!
And beat em ups are one of my favorite types of games!
With fluent art style and fluent controls with fun and fast-pased gameplay it's a must have!

I rate this game a 100000/10

4157,"Good game, it makes sure you have to balance your skill points through out all of the skills instead of just 1, the  fighting could have more variation but from my experience it does feel good. That's mostly what makes this game good."

4159,I love this game more than I should
4160,top tier game to play with the homies
4161,באמת שזה מחשק ממש ממש טוב אני מאוד ממליצה אחד המשחקים הראשונים ששחקתי האנימציה ממש ממש יפה ובכללי המשחק ממש ממש נחמד אני מאוד אועהבת
4162,A classic that I could NEVER get over really especially with how many characters are in the game. Sadly my only gripe about this game is that I wish that they had added a DLC that would extend the map out and branch out to an entire new story.  As long as you can have fun with friends that's really all that matters!
4163,i will personally hunt down anybody who leaves this a bad rating.
4164,Back off barbarian. More like back off this game final countdown is too hard >:(

4218,amazing experience
4219,"The game is timeless. No matter what others games you add to the list, Castle Crashers will never be forgotten."
4220,VERY VERY gud game abit of a grind tho :)
4221,normal mode takes about a couple hours. insane mode take LIKE 1000 HOURS
4222,"Really fun if you enjoy Behemoth games. I know for me personally it's one of my favorite games on steam so hopefully that says something. I can see why someone would dislike it though, as most of the fighting involves smashing your A and W keys and it can get a bit repetitive. However, even though it repeats itself a bit in its fighting it has a consistent story present through the levels that has plenty of gameplay, hell I even have about 300 hours on it. After you finish the main story you can replay it in hard mode with a newly unlocked character based on which one you complete the first run with. And if you don't like the story mode there is an arena, a board game type mode, and plenty of quests and things to unlock to try."

Ok ok ok, I'm late to this game, but I'm so glad I found it. This is a super fun co-op beat'em up with some cutie meme style graphics. 4 players, with really 1 LGBT+ type character, that is sort of the female one as well, since the games story focuses on the classic 'rescue princesses and get the treasure back' motif. The RPG character development is simple but works, with options to focus on magic/range vs. melee. Some of the aspects are cartoonish in gore or potty humor, it's fun. There are some PVP elements and other aspects to try and keep you involved, like unlocking characters. The only downsides I have for this game are, 1) it's short, the entire game with friends can be completed in a few hours and 2) there are not additional content DLCs. So once the game is over, the game is pretty much over.

Finding it on Steam, as an adult now, and having those memories come back in a rush of nostalgia was so fun! Buying this again in present time, I play solo now (one day I'll convince someone to play with me!) and it's just as fun and silly as I remember! Great time waster!

If you like satisfying combos, eye candy game play, catchy music and a ton of replay value then this game is for you. It also has two 99 cent DLC that goes to a good cause. As you can see by my total play time I enjoy this game a lot."

4354,An absolute classic and a beautiful call back to Newgrounds. Seriously fun and worth it!
4355,"Perfect. Great game, great memories"
4356,"“Story (? /10)”: The game´s plot is a stereotypical “Mario rescues the Princess” story and all off the characters are mute (except for The Painter boss fight which has some voice lines) so I think it would be unfair to give a score to this aspect of the game. With that being said I can at least say that the game is pretty funny with visual gags and references to other games.

“Graphics, Animation and Presentation (8/10)”: The art style is very colorful and goofy, fits the type of Newgrounds humor and flash animation the game has. Characters and bosses have great and distinct designs that make them stand out between all the chaos during gameplay. One negative thing about the graphics is that although the backgrounds have amazing details and quality the ground your character stands on is very flat and lacks texture, which may be a bit jarring when you notice the line that divides the background and floor.

“Music & Sound Design (8/10)”: Sound effects, melee hits and using magic spells are very unique and they have a very “slapping sound”, something fitting for the silly and absurd style of the game. The soundtrack has lots of variety, from orchestral pieces to techno and metal songs too, it’s very catchy and depending on the level it may pump you up for the action.

“Gameplay (6/10)”: The game works as a regular beat em up, with light and heavy attacks, magical and ranged moves, grapples, blocks and juggling enemies. On top of this there is a small layer of customization due to having multiple characters with their own special magic spells, you can earn exp by fighting enemies, which lets you focus on 4 stats (Strength, magic, defense and agility). You can also equip different weapons and “animal orbs” which they give you different stat boosts and special effects. 
 The combat in this game can get very repetitive and stale, especially because of how much health some enemies can have in the later stages. A big nuisance during the game is to position yourself vertically, enemy hitboxes are very thin and you´ll find yourself missing several attacks due to depth perception messing with you, a more forgiving hitbox for enemies would´ve been nice. 

“Level Design (6.5/10)”: The levels you travel have a good amount of visual variety, secret walls or hidden treasure to discover (mostly weapons and orbs) and each world has their own type of hazards and/or gimmicks: such as riding rafts on a river, walking on slippery ice, dodging active volcanoes shooting lava, etc. Some stages on the 2nd half of the game overstay their welcome and can be very slow and boring to traverse (like the swamp or the “Full Moon” levels).

“Difficulty Curve (6/10)”: The game progressively gets harder and you´ll occasionally you will hit some difficulty bumps due to new types of enemies being introduced, or being swarmed by too many enemies in later stages, most of these problems can be lessened by having a friend or 2 by your side, but playing on solo you may need to grind some levels to get further. 

“Price and Length (short and cheap)”: The game doesn’t ask much money from you and it´s also very frequently on sale. It can last about 4 hours if you just complete the main story and over 12 hours if you look to collect more weapons and achievements, the game also has some great replay value by unlocking more characters as you beat it with your previously unlocked characters and it also adds a harder difficulty if you are looking for a challenge.

“Final thoughts and Score”: This game is a bit slow and it can get boring if you play alone, if you decide to get this game, make sure you have 1 to 3 friends to play with you, otherwise you may not enjoy it as much as you could. For a solo run I give this game a 6 out of 10, if you get some friends then I’d say a 6.5/10.

4361,"ah yes, the 8 years war. a truly magnificent oversee of what a major war can do and turn history on its head. but for such an amazing period in the worlds history, less and less people know about it each month. Behemoth found this to be quite concerning and decided to spend 6 years on further knowledge-ing themselves on the events and battles that took place, step by step, slash by slash to get the most accurate representation of the war. with their knew found knowledge, they decided to create CASTLE CRASHERS, a realistic representation of what actually happened on the grounds of warfare in the English and franco frontlines within 12 different continents. this teaches the players on what exactly happened, gives options for players to spare others, and lastly allows you to decide how the game ends with over 16 different endings, each which are unique and offers a complete mood change, ranging from happy to sad to even angered. i recommend historians to play this game, and young children who wish to learn about the greatest war in history."

4419,been playing since before middle school on the xbox 360. leaving my sophomore year of college it's still held up like i never left it. :)
4420,i had originally owned this game on XBOX 360 but had almost zero skill in this type of game and could not beat the first boss for over a year even though its incredibly easy. in a short amount of time after wards i beat the game with my cousin and sister. it soon became the game i played the most and had managed to level up 3 knights to level 99. i had played actively played it for over 7 years until my XBOX 360 had broken and when i had purchased a new XBOX i had lost the game and all the progress because it was the only game that i had that was not on a disk. though i lost all my progress i was still in love with the game and had later purchased it on PC. with a controller the game is a lot easier to do things such as use magic as you don't have to move your fingers in difficult positions. i have stopped using magic because its a lot harder on keyboard but i want to get a controller that will work with PC.
4421,"I can't put into words how much I'd recommend you get this game! The soundtrack is amazing, there are 31 different characters and a Insane Mode making it so you can play the game 62 times! And with friends the game is a blast too! Now if you may not have anyone to play with.. (Don't feel alone, I'm in the same boat here) Thankfully there is an online feature so you may even find me playing online and we could become friends! Now there is the option of Parsec so you could find people to play with there too. Also if you happen to own BattleBlock Theater you can unlock Hatty Hattington as a Character!
And you can unlock a Knight head in BattleBlock Theater too. Not to mention all of the unlockables in this game! Including all of the Weapons, Animal Orbs, Characters and Magic abilities when you level up!
So yeah, I'd 200% recommend you pick up this game when you get a chance!"
4422,"idk why i havent review this game before but its a lot of fun, alone and with friends, such a nostalgia trip"
4423,nice game
4424,gud
4425,"It was fun and enjoyable with fantastic art but I don't know how this save the game :(
I really liked this game and it's difficulty and its best to play it with a controller an Di had even more fun playing local co-op!

8/10
Very enjoyable"
4426,"fart man is pretty good, and white is ass."
4427,"pog game

4439,"I have spent my blood, sweat and tears into this game. I have cried while playing, take this how you want to."
4440,10/10 very poopy
4441,"Good indie game, very silly and random. Good mechanics, does require some skill for sure."
4442,"amazing local co op. 
sometimes online can lag depending who you are playing with.
for the most part you will have to find players in the discussions or discord  for the game or have friends to play with when it comes to online. 
for me as a side scrolling beat em up this game is 10/10.
very easy when it comes to multiplayer to get your friends playing because its fairly simple to pick up the controls and go. lots to unlock could use more co op unlocks but still awesome
its a button masher. higher difficulty is hard and grindy.  on sale its very cheap and still worth the pick up in 2022"
4443,ITS SOOO FUN
4444,"its jesus
"
4445,"good game
"
4446,"I never played this on the Xbox360 and was introduced to this game only a couple days ago. My friends wanted me to play it and I refused multiple times, they bought the game for me against my will and then I played it. I have to say I really like this game and am somewhat glad I missed out. It's all new and has the same nostalgia feeling I got years ago. If I play this game more with them, I will for sure remember this and get the same, ""I miss playing this with my friends."" thoughts. Get this game with your friends if you have not played it already."
4447,Not to bad originally i was a bit sceptical about buying it but im enjoying it so far and its quite a good deal and its much more fun with friends
4448,"i've been playing Castle Crashers since 2009 on the Xbox 360, later on the Xbox one when it released there, and then the game went on sale on steam giving me more then enough reason to play through this amazing game once more. 
The game is nostalgic and reminiscent of the old gaming era when no one cared what you did or said on the internet, meaning you'll get good old fashioned jokes that are still okay in today's standards but more 2008 if you know what i mean. i recommend this game to many people and i hope you play it, its funnier to play in co-op because one might take all your coins or one might keep taking all the XP. either way, i hope you enjoy this game as this game holds a very special place in my heart.

(i have 4.3k hours added all together from Xbox360,XboxOne, and PC)"

4466,"Ive played this game for too many hours to count (literally) on just my xbox 360. I  bought it on my xbox one as soon as I got it and when I switched to computer, I got it for my entire friend group just because this game means so much to me. This game has shaped who I am over the years and I keep coming back to it. The behemoth always makes great games. 10/10."

4540,I had SO much fun playing this game with my friends a few years ago. Highly recommend it. The gameplay has a nice feel to it. The game conveys the story very well through visuals only and there are some pretty funny moments. It's just too bad I lost my progress.

4544,"This is a very very beautiful & fun game, It's SO good to play with your friends, also very fun to play in singelplayer mode. Congrats!"

4546,"Goofy sidescrolling beat'em up with comedic elements, coop and even a PvP moment each stage. Even though it has quite some springs on its back, it's still fun and challenging.
The various characters have different skills and combos, which greatly increases the game otherwise quite short playability.
A really fun game with no pretenses, that offers several hours of entertainment, even better if you face its challenges with up to 3 friends."
4547,"The overall game is quite worth the purchase.
It is quite fun to play with friends but a little bit grindy at times.

Very classic beat em up gameplay with likable graphics and art.

Gameplay: 7/10

4563,"Out of all of the games I played on steam, this has to be in my top 2."

4629,"I really liked this game. The art style is so funny, and the humor of this game is like mindless beating things to death. It isn't a very long game but it is kinda hard if you don't play these type of games. There is so much to do even though its not an open world. there are many characters and hidden weapons, pets, and areas. If you are looking for a game to hang out with your friends at 12:00 in the morning then this is the game for you. Id say the only thing that they did wrong is not make a sequel to this game. Other than that this game is perfect."

4640,very good game should buy it i got over 15 hours it it its super fun by your self or with friends
4641,Fun :)
4642,"this game is a relic of old flash games that made it big, it has an endless amount of replayability and is so much fun. I would highly recommend playing with other people because the more chaos the more fun this game becomes. Most of this games combat is just juggling the enemies in the air and when your able to successfully pull off one of these combos its the most satisfying thing ever You should really try it out if you haven't already!"
4643,"right direction, everything else meh."
4644,good game
4645,Stoopid game ever
4646,Castles do be crashing. Also spoiler: women do be clowns tho.
4647,"childhood game but im not blinded by nostalgia, the game is genuinely good"
4648,"From The last 6-5 years of playing it, From Xbox 360 To Xbox one to PC, It was amazing, And a lot of fighting."
4649,GAME MADE MY CHILDHOOD. i love this game so much i hold it very close to my heart 10/10 recommend for a casual game to have fun with your friends and family
4650,friend stole my gf and money. good game 9/10 simulating real life.
4651,this game so good my dad came back
4652,"i love the game i recall playing it on the xbox 360 with my dad who i don,t see much of these days i love the characters i love the style the sound it makes when you whack a guy in the head the boss fights the soundtrack the art pretty much everything is perfect but i do have a few complaints that if asked i could show in video what exactly am referring to such as stun lock in the arenas i absolutely despise arenas so much so that i wish the developers would just remove it i would avoid playing the arenas but you unlock playable characters when you beat all the waves and me wanting to 100% the game would not work if i did that. you can get stun locked in arenas if you have a guy hitting you while another is shooting you or if towards the last few waves all of them surround you and hit you at once both of which can happen very easily and if that happens you will not be able to move at all and will most likely die. the big muscle bad guys grab range is to way long and some of them move to fast the only super effective way i found to fight them is to jump over there heads and throw bombs but the problem is some of them take all your bombs to kill 1 or 2 of them and you can only get more bombs after the level is complete you can jump over them and hit them in the head but that takes forever to kill them and half the time it doesn't work and they grab you anyways they do an absurd amount of damage and they often have smaller enemies with them to make it that much more stupidly hard to fight them you can only carry a few heals and if you fight them you will most likely use them all and if you die you have to restart from the beginning and all the things you used such as heals bombs etc you now have to grind to get money to get those items back oh boy how fun. the bosses are easier than the big muscle guys. those are my biggest complaints. complaints of which i have many more but honestly i don,t care enough to write them down because to me they are very minor issues that have a lot of work around,s available as to where the major ones i feel don,t and even if they do they are still extremely annoying. i do recommend this game a lot of bang for your buck and its fun i also recommend the 2 dlc characters."
4653,How to crash the cassle? ?? thx
4654,this was my childhood
4655,Its a good beat em up. I'm not sure how to put it then nostalgia.

4668,"This game is like if L4D2 or one of its countless copies didn't give you AI teammates and threw the same number of special infected at you. Can't recommend if you want a fun game, only if you want a co-op game. For reference, me and my friends used to have a blast beating each other with sticks and this is the video game equivalent of that. The difference being that when I was a kid, we were all in on it. This game is like your dad beating you with a walking stick while your brothers laugh at you."

4685,Very good. I played this when I was 6 and I loved it
4686,castle crashers is fun.
4687,one of the best co-op games on the xbox 360 back in the day and i'll always cherish the memory of the first time i witnessed a giant fucking bear taking a real dumper of a crap in the woods. oh yeah the gameplay is good too if that matters to you.
4688,good

4726,"An absolute amazing 2D side scroller game, I had a blast while playing this even though I've watched countless lets plays in the past without even owning the game itself. Games a bit short only being completed in 8 - 10 hours in one sitting if done properly. But It's worth it cause I saw a defecating deer."
4727,I have almost 350 hours on this game so far and I love playing it I just wish it was more popular and I had people to play it with. If you get yourself and 2 other friends to play this game it will be a really good time with a lot of laughs and suprieses for everyone. The game offers a lot after the story is completed since there are 30 different characters with different abilities that you can unlock and complete the game with and maybe even try Insane mode if you feel up to it.
4728,"cool game, it is grindy though so if you dont like that sort of thing, you might still enjoy this one cuz its very fun"

Before this game had hackers and the first person to have ""the glitch"" on the Xbox leaderboards (forcing them to the #1 spot with a negative value for score), a close friend and I teamed up with two others we met online and %100 both modes. We managed to get to the top of the world board with the online friends taking the first two spots, my close friend at 3rd and me at 4th. I'm in my mid-20's now and this game has some of my fondest gaming memories with that friend along with probably my proudest personal achievement in gaming."

4780,"Please Note that the majority of my playtime on this game has not been recorded on steam due to it being played offline. I am also only reviewing the adventure portion of the game as it is the main playable section.

This Game is a side-scrolling, multi-player, beat-em'-up, adventure with a quirky sense of humor. 
In old school fashion you can unlock new characters by completing the story line with a different character. 
Each Character has its own special magic spells (although very few repeat)
There are plenty of secrets and easter eggs for the eagle-eyed player to find.
Multiple unlockable weapons and pets.
Oh yeah. you can have a cute little animal follow you around everywhere you go that offer stat bonuses. 

The controls are tight and exactly what you would expect from a sidescrolling beat-em-up. 
It makes a great Party game. 
 Score: 95/100"
4781,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

Overall this game is a 10/10"

4825,"This game gives a huge amount of nostalgia for me, considering it was
the first game I ever really played properly on a console, at times it can be challenging,
but working your way around it really helps, it is also a bit of a grind, considering 
levels reset on each character, but it can be enjoying learning combos and new abilities from your magic,
overall this game is solid and deserves my respect... 10/10"

4966,yes
4967,Very great game to waste your time on.
4968,"great game, super fun"
4969,"A pretty mindless beat 'em up. Classic game. I'd recommend a full party of 4 because the games goes faster, because by yourself or with only one other person, it's a very slow and tedious button mashing experience. Great to play with friends who are shitty at games"
4970,crashers crash the castle. 10/10
4971,A fun fantasy beat-em-up which blends traditional gameplay and a newgrounds aesthetic.
4972,"Nice shit we got here,Multiplayer,singleplayer,and minigames!"
4973,"My childhood is here, all right here...Tears be all up on my face now"
4974,Sittin' on the toilet
4975,many great memories
4976,"Probably one of the most random games in my library, sharing a spot with yakuza 0. Its funny, has a nice visual style and a funky soundtrack. Would recommend it to anyone that searches for a small game to play with up to three friends! Also never forget: Never let the flying deer get you ;)"
4977,Fun cheap game you will stop playing after 1 day

-REVIEW-

As a longtime Steam user with a way-too-long library, I tend to forget about games I haven’t played in a few years. The game in question, in which my last play through was back in 2017, is Castle Crashers, a fantasy medieval arcade beat ‘em up with an art style reminiscent of Alien Hominid, one of the most well known games to come out of Newgrounds.

Yep, I’m that freaking old.

Castle Crashers definitely sounds like a crazy party game…and it pretty much is! Whether playing alone or with friends, the aim of the game is simple: move from left to right, hacking and slashing the ever loving crap out of anything that moves. Use anything at your disposal: weapons, magic, throwable crap…there’s even a horse chase! It’s mindless fun, so don’t expect anything deep, but if all you’re looking for is a beat ‘em up with colorful graphics, silly looking enemies, and a story that pops out at the start, then hides until the very end when you’d forgotten about it, then this is the game for you.

Ok, let’s start with the story. The colorful cast of characters are chilling at a party in the castle when OH CRAP WE’RE BEING RAIDED. You go out, quell the raid, and finish the bad guy just in time to see three princesses get yoinked off their feet by more bad guys. Gee, I wonder what we’ll have to do now?! Let’s call that guy, um, Mario or whoever, he might have an idea! I mean, what were you expecting? It’s a BEAT ‘EM UP. Every last one has a plotline as shallow and thin as Cryaotic’s moral compass, and this one particularly so, as there isn’t even really any dialogue. That said, I couldn’t help but find that one boss fight with the wedding chapel’s organist particularly charming, so hey, the game’ll still make you laugh, at least.

Gameplay, therefore, is where all the attention is, and just like how the various weapons make contact with enemies via wild and crazy swinging, the gameplay here pretty much slaps, as today’s youth would say. The game can be played solo or with up to three other friends, has controller support, and even incorporates light RPG elements, specifically for melee damage, defense, and even magic power. In terms of PVP, there isn’t a whole lot, basically an optional arena where the players can square off for bragging rights and goodies(funny enough, there’s even a last minute throw down over the final princess after you beat the last boss in the game). At the end of the day, the game is basically all combat, so don’t expect much in the way of deviation, but if you’re okay with that, then you’ll have a blast, as the combat is always frenetic and high octane, as waves of minions and some well designed bosses will test your mettle. It’s not anything overly deep or complicated; just plug in a controller, choose your character, and giggle with delight as you crush everything in your path. There’s even a fair bit of replayability in terms of unlocking new characters, primarily minions you’d ordinarily fight, each with their own magic powers. The only real negative is that a few bosses tend to overstay their welcome(glares at the giant ear of corn), but even that’ll do little to wreck your fun if you’re patient enough. 

Finally, aesthetic-wise, graphics, music, and sound are, of course, fan-freaking-tastic. The game is colorful, with every level standing out in unique visual detail, and the music and sounds are largely comical, helping to add to the game’s goofy fun, even knowing you’re off on a quest to save princesses. It all adds up to an adventure that doesn’t want you to take it seriously, just to relax and have fun. That’s ok in my book!

So for those of you who want an exciting, combat heavy medieval adventure, but realize you can’t deal with the Dark Souls games for reasons ranging from fear of dying a lot to blood pressure issues, give this silly little romp a try. It’s not like you won’t need any skill, but it is a lot more easygoing and, in it’s own way, fun-loving. Honestly, the only way it could be an even bigger fiesta is if it was called Party Crashers. Thanks for reading!"
5005,"This is a great game for many reasons, tons of pets to find secrets and buff you charterers stats. Many weapons and elaborate ways to unlock them. So many characters with all different powers. Skilled and casual player can play with cool combo's, which use your characters powers. And fun mini games to play with friends and ( even though steam edition has a different one to the original ) a fun button mash game."
5006,"One of my favorite childhood games.

Strong memories from this one

5010,"Recently unlocked all weapons and one of my friends asked if I'm ready to shelve this game. I now have one less friend and I'm not stopping till I unlock the Necromancer.

10/10 would destroy 2 more controllers (and still might) while playing this masterpiece."
5011,"i played this alot with my cousin when i was younger and it is still as enjoyable as it was back then

also the art style is timeless"

5013,"pretty nice game. you kill people, crash castles, kiss princesses, play volleyball, and all that crazy stuff."
5014,"abseloute pog, this is my childhood"
5015,"was a bit laggy but if my connection was better it would be great! i already played a bit before without lagging with my friend
"
5016,I recommend it. It's a solid game with great music and some satisfying combat.
5017,"smash, smash, smash!"
5018,is a very good game
5019,its really fun with friends
5020,Been playing this game on and off across all platforms since it's release on the Xbox 360. Great game that I find myself coming back to at least once a year.
5021,I am a knight in real life too so this was easy.
5022,"To be honest, I don't really get the widespread acclaim this game has received. It's certainly a fun little game that can be enjoyable to play with friends, but it's not something I've ever wanted to really revisit in the years since I've completed it. Regardless, I would recommend it if only to play what is now a rather prominent game from the recent past. It regularly goes on sale for dirt cheap so you might as well wait for one of those. 

Also if you're someone who likes to go for 100% achievements, beware the 2 multiplayer-only grinds that this one has. I know most people don't care but figured I would mention that."
5023,good
5024,good!
5025,I enjoy the humor and the amount of unique magic attacks
5026,i love this game
5027,midgets
5028,not biased
5029,"The folks at behemoth games made a masterpiece as their debut game; an honest rarity in the world of gaming. I'd recommend this game to people of all ages as it is insane amounts of fun and better with a crew of fellow knights at your side.

10/10; on my way to 100% this game."

5060,"I love this game alot, please buy so you can too. Thanks you."
5061,this is one of my fav games ever I have played endless hours I beat the game and I didn't Evan use one dlc I demand you get this game I would pay 100$ for this game shaped my childhood!
5062,its like marriage you beat the game once and beat it again but eventually you get tired of it and it starts to become boring as fuck
5063,"I put in hundreds of hours into this on Xbox360, will always stay as one of the best classic beat-em-ups of all time. I always revisit this from time to time not only because of the nostalgia but just because of how goddamn good it is to play. If you have somehow never played this do so right now, because this game deserves love even after all these years."

5078,"Castle Crashers is a classic for a reason. It's simple combat system feels great to combo in, it's art direction is the perfect blend of style, and early 2010's silliness. Level design is generally good, and characters and builds vary just enough to make multiple playthroughs interesting without losing it's simplicity.

While I still recommend it, it's not immune to age unfortunately. A lot of things mar what would otherwise be a near perfect experience. Not being able to skip cutscenes for example, makes restarting levels insufferable. You shouldn't have to wait for an elaborate animation of an owl shitting itself to death to play out before you move on to the next screen every single time you die in the Forest Entrance. 

Additionally, this seems to be more an issue in later levels than the earlier ones. The game tends to go out of it's way to make the fun simple combo system totally worthless. (Fuck Full Moon, all my homies hate Full Moon) Later in the game it becomes a requirement to have a high magic stat and a strong magic character to progress since it starts flooding levels with enemies that can't be air comboed, or even comboed at all. Hell, beefy enemies can't even be melee'd unless you get lucky enough to land 4-5 perfectly spaced strikes to their head, or else you just get insta-grabbed and oops, a fourth of your life is gone! (Or you're playing blue knight). This turns Castle Crasher's combat, it's greatest strength, into an absolute slog. It's just not fun strafing the enemy, and spamming your magic splash attack until they die. I wanna combo in the beat 'em up game!

Also, small thing, but hitboxes are jank as fuck, and It's a total dice toss what you can jump over or block. In fact, I almost stopped using my block entirely half way through the game. Against bosses the block is almost totally worthless, and enemies too often surround and flank you for blocking to be useful for anything other than blocking a couple projectiles on wake up. Not to mention that sometimes you'll aim your shield the complete wrong way when you try to turn around and block right after.

Take these criticisms with a grain of salt though, since I've only played solo thus far. 

Despite these flaws, Castle Crashers is still fun as fuck, and I totally recommend it. Especially if you've played Guacamelee and you've been itching for a game with a similar combat system."

BUT

*You need a controller to play otherwise it's almost unbearable (Wasn't Intended for PC)
*Multiplayer can be extremely LATENT, like some of the worst out there

Other than these two things, if you can get around them the game has an absurdly cheesy story and it's just a beat em up game unlike any other you'll ever play."

5117,"My uncle smoked his entire life. He was like a brother to me. Seeing someone suffer through addiction, smoking 3 packs a day can take a toll on a toddler's mental health and his relationship with tobacco influenced me. I spent my life with him. Everyday when he went to drop me off from school, he would hum a tune. It was a happy, energetic tune. It made my day when he sang it and I would always ask him what that tune was. ""Guess"". That was always his response. I always got frustrated. Fast forward and he's lying on his deathbed. Lung cancer. I never did get to ask him what that tune was. I missed the moment when his heart stopped. 10 years later, I find myself humming this tune, out of nowhere. Not sure if this was a message from the galaxy or some sign from god but it's 4 am in the morning and I'm plating Castle Crashers with 3 of my friends. After finishing an area, I hear a tune. Extremely familiar but I can't quite place it. That's when I realised. I broke down into tears. Waterflame - The race around the world. This game taught me discipline, patience, principals, but most importantly, the influence video games as a whole has had on my life. I still find myself enjoying this game with my friends and think about my uncle everytime. This game has been one of the best experience i have had. Ever."

5138,"The Behemoth’s incredibly fun cooperative beat–em-up would’ve been pure brawler perfection if the multiplayer had launched in better form. It’s incredibly frustrating that it’s easier to play Castle Crashers with strangers than with your friends, but it’s still a great brawler that will soak up your time. Between unlocking new characters so you can level them up to finding all of the hidden weapons and animal orbs, there’s a lot to do in the campaign mode. If you never experienced the Xbox 360 version, or you happen to have more friends on your PSN list, Castle Crashers is a great game though you might want to wait for a multiplayer patch before investing."

5202,"For information we recommend this game with RTX 2070 Super and Raisin 3900X.
Castle Raiding offers you 50 shots at 50 or less viewing or actual packet and sets a maximum of 60 shots to 1080. With lots of options and surprises.
At moderate intensity, light travels at a rate of 1080 pixels at 60 frames per second and drops to 50 at many points. If you have an RTX card and suitable equipment, a great card seems to have many choices and many surprises-a game worth mentioning. Light and pleasant.
As the game continues to grow, it still has many drawbacks. According to other users, the game does not threaten or disrupt.
This is good among us, but it is not over yet."
5203,Good
5204,Great game had a  blast still havent completed it
5205,"A [i] funny[/i] and [i] enjoyable [/i] AF Mash it up! 

Playing in 2D has never been so fun. 

Music, battles, situations, weapons and even collecting the pets leads you to chaos and fun. 

The Behemoth is a studio with some gems in their repertory, worth a tiny detour if you may. 
Pick any game and [i] you won't be disappointed. [/i]"
5206,"Really like this game. Have hundreds of hours on the Xbox 360 but the pc version is awful. If you want to play multiplayer you have to deal with really bad input delay making it pretty much unplayable, and it seems the devs have no intention of fixing this ever."
5207,"The game will either be constantly freezing or have a 3 second input delay in multiplayer. It works fine in single player but i have gotten multiplayer to work 1 time after at least a hundred attempts. On my Xbox with no ethernet cord, with people from across the whole world it works fine. On my PC with an ethernet cord, while playing with my brother who is in the same house as me, it never works. If you want to play multiplayer DO NOT PURCHASE but if you want to play single player i highly recommend it."

5220,"Fun game, eat sandwich, shit self."
5221,"An absolute classic from The Behemoth Studios!
This game is a beat-em-up, where you play as knights to defeat an evil wizard and save 4 princesses along the way. The plot itself isn't anything super eccentric or complicated. This game is definitely something fun to play with a couple of other friends. There's so many different mini-games to compete against your friends as well so there's much more than just beating the crap out of each other for hours. However, while the game is fun with friends, beyond the story mode, and mini-games there's an optional Hard mode which is better to take on with friends than alone, not only that but you could max out all the levels for each knight, which already is a big enough ordeal itself. Castle Crashers is a good way to spend some time with some friends for a couple of hours."

5232,"Super Fun, I actually played this on xbox 360 for about 2 years before I started playing games on computer, I got this and it was definitely a very nostalgic, exiting experience. I would change a few small things, nothing game changing though. I wish you could optionally make the projectile magic as light attack instead of item. I've probably wasted 20+ potions accidentally trying to use my magic. And I also would like the ability to make some of the graphics even less demanding (less particles, less defined backgrounds, ect). It's not a slideshow, but the fps goes down to like 10-20 or something. Anyways, I would definitely recommend the game, just giving a couple ideas for improvement too."

5252,"Castle Crashers is a fantastic game. What more is there to say? The game has all the comic fantasy beat-em-up goodness, backed up with an absolute banger of a soundtrack. The game is made by a guy literally called Dan Paladin! All the DLC proceeds go to charitable donations by the devs. This game really has no parallel in the (albeit specific) domain it occupies. The game has aged very well, in part thanks to a well-timed remaster and expansion to newer consoles. The game is packed with hilarious and challenging environments and boss fights. Did I mention the incredible soundtrack by the folks from Newgrounds? The game has just the right dosage of customisation, min-max potential and cool combat techniques to master. The game is full to the brim with slapstick fantasy charm. For the most part the bosses are well-designed and fun to fight. The game has a variety of secrets to discover. It's achievements are maybe too few and far between (also somewhat finnicky to pop), but the level pacing is steady and well-structured. For hardcore fans the game provides extra minigames and harder difficulties to complete the game on. Alright, here come the gripes. The whole princesses and knights thing is a joke. I get it. But a little more equity would have been appreciated, especially since I played through this game for hours with my young sisters. The clown ending does help to shatter this problem somewhat. *sigh* Now to get to the volleyball level. The volleyball level is easily one of the worst I've ever played in a video game. It completely deviates from the skills and feel of the levels leading up to it. The volleyball hitbox is incredibly minute and the enemy team AI probably violates all of Asimov's laws. That fricking robot emotionally hurt me. It took me hours to beat the volleyball level, not because sucked at the game, but because for the duration of the one level the game sucked at being itself. It's sad that a game as flowly and fun as Castle Crashers has such a colossal speed-bump. The story is nothing special, which is fine because it doesn't need to be. Overall this game is a blast and I... VEVDELEDEV'S GOLDEN KEYS THE SOUNDTRACK IS GOATED! On sale Castle Crashers is a very respectable price for the high quality it delivers. Oh also, it has a dragon sword. I'm looking at all of you, 11-year-old Ninjago fans. The games an absolute blast-shower. Forget the Strontium-90 raining down on your house and go play this game. Also if you turn off gore and talk to any young females present about modern gender norms, this game becomes a smash-hit for the whole family. Alright, I'm slipping in 50's TV presenter mode. I better wrap this review up."

5281,"This game has to be one of my favourite games that i have played through the years. I started playing this game in 2013, and recently finally beaten the game in 2022. The nostalgia it gives me through the years feels incredible. The characters are simplistic and memorable. I grew up with this game and i've never forgotten about this game."

5296,"Excellent couch party co-op, with an insane mode for the more hardcore players after the regular campaign. Have had far too much fun on this game!"
5297,"It's like Skyrim mixed with Sekiro, except for not really at all.  Great game though."
5298,"This game is really fun. The story is very simple- bad guy kidnapped the princesses and stole a magical crystal that does… something?- but the gameplay is what really sells the game. 
The RPG aspects are pretty simple, especially when you have friends to cover your weakness when you only build magic or strength. Outside of RPG building and stuff, it can be fun to figure out combos with the plethora of offensive abilities you have, and a whole lot of characters to choose from to figure out which skills you want.
The game gets so much better with friends too. Everyone can build what they want and it works. It just works.

Buy this game, especially in the frequent times when this game is buyable for less than half of its normal price. It's definitely worth it."

5315,"Truly a hidden gem!

I'll recommend this game to anyone who like the Beat-em up genre. The game has a good amount of content with a lot of characters that each have their own unique abilities that can fit anyone's play-style. The combat is very satisfying and something new for the Beat-em up genre. The story-line is also mixed with epic boss fights filled with action and absolute jammers.

My overall rating for this game is a 10/10
PS: This game is hella fun with your buddies, play it with them."

It works better as a multiplayer game with friends, because some levels can be a bit daunting on your own.

5354,"silly little knights, what they do?"
5355,"I personally enjoy this game, I have been playing it for a while. I like the multiplayer option to play with your friends remotely and together on the same screen. I love the concept of the different characters you can unlock and how there is a certain way to unlock them. I also like the pets and items you unlock. This game is a perfect game to play with your friends late at night. It is a lot of fun and an adventurous game to enjoy playing. I honestly recommend this game, as a good multiplayer game due to all the features it provides you with. If you are looking for a good multiplayer game to play, this is it. Despite the fact that it is 2021 and this game came out in 2012, it is still a good game that you should play. I'd say the graphics are great for a game that old. The only thing is the price on steam, many people won't buy the game because of the price. I'd suggest lowering the price to receive more players. But this is a good game and I recommend it."

Oh my science epic reddit moment tiktok bad Keanu chungus wholesome 100 reddit moment i beat up a kid that said minecraft bad and my doggo bit him so i gave him snaccos to the point where he did weigh 69420 kg (nice 😳) and died of heart attack, so I posted his corpse on r/chonkers and got 100000000000 upvotes. and we watched pewdiepie together while in elon musk’s cyber truck talking about how superior reddit memers are : “haha emojis bad” i said and keanu reeves came outta nowhere and said “this is wholesome 100, updoot this wholesome boy” so i got alot of updoots and edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger. but the kind stranger revealed himself to be baby yoda eating chiccy nuggies and drinking choccy milk so we went to the cinema to see our (communism funny) favorite movies avengers endgame but then thor played fortnite and fortnite bad, so then i said “reality is often dissappointing” and then baby yoda replied r/unexpectedthanos and i replied by r/expectedthanos for balance and then danny devito came to pick us up from the cinema and all the insta normies and gay mods stood watching ,as we,superior redditors went home with danny devito to suck on his magnum dong but i said no ♥♥♥♥ and started sucking,not like those gay mods,then the next morning we woke up to MrBeast telling us to plant 69420 million trees, me, baby yoda and danny said nice, and then on our way to plant 69420 million trees (nice) we saw a kid doing a tiktok so keanu reeves appeared and said “we have a kid to burn” and i replied “you’re breathtaking” so i said “i need a weapon” and baby yoda gave me an RPG so i blew the kid (DESTRUCTION 100) and posted it on r/memes and r/dankmemes and r/pewdiepiesubmissions and got 1000000000 updoots,i’m sure pewds will give me a big pp, then I laughed as I eviscerated the kid that fell into harambe's enclosure, then we ♥♥♥♥ on emoji users and started dreaming about girls that will never like me and posted a lie on r/teenagers about how i got a GF after my doggo died by the hands of fortnite players so i exploited his death for updoots, but i watched the sunset with the wholesome gang (keanu,danny,Mrbeast, pewds, spongebob,stefan karl , bob ross, steve irwin, baby yoda and other artists that reddit exploits them) [Everyone liked that] WHOLESOME 100 REDDIT 100 Jojo reference muda muda muda ora ora ora this is funny
The next day:
""M-m... M""
No one was paying attention as I was giving my speech.
""M-m-mine...""
However, one person was intrigued in what I was saying.
""M-m-m-minecraft...""
Then it was just a domino effect, ten more people are watching.
""Minecraft...""
A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.
""MINECRAFT...""
But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.
""Minecraft good Fortnite bad""
Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking Science, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.
I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior, Science.
""M-m-mi... Mine...""
""MINE...""
Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.
""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT""
No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.
Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.

Billions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world.
This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.
Congratulations.

5398,"in depth review, like usual for me. if you don't want to read a 10 minute review dont do so. but if you are considering buying this game, and are lucky enough to find this. please do. one of my favorite games and one of the games i recommend to anyone who is starting gaming.

This game is easy to grasp, and the controls are simple enough on PC, but the game is much easier with a controller. (xbox),

as someone who has 100% this game on multiple occasions. i can tell you this game is worth the price. this games replayability accounts for that, and multiplayer is just another level of fun.
get in a discord call, buy a few friends this game and play it blind, (as blind as you can). before reading the rest of this. and if you want to read the rest before you buy, here you go!

Okay so, up to 4 players to play and multiple other technical / tactical ways to play this game

if you are playing in a call with friends its much easiar to communicate. aswell as the multiplier for multiplayer.

difficulty gets multiplied by 1.5, so 2 player it would be 2x, 3.5, then 4.5.

there's builds (tank, mage, agility, strengh.

every level up to about 50 you get a skill point to use (if you level up you get it at the end of that level). and you can backtrack.
the map is simple but everyone can control it so dont let your friends troll you. let one person use the map, etc. communication is key in this game. but you can also mess around with friends.

you can reset stats if you want, in the home menu. press stats, i dont reccomend it though.

there isnt really much to talk about besides how to do a few things, which i have listed guides below. so here you go.

last but not least, guides.

if there is anything else you think i should/ will add i will, i've been reviewing a bunch of games i've played to get into the steam community more. if you want me to come back at a later date with more information on this game. i most definitely will."
5399,a
5400,"I’m going to start with the negative here: once you’ve played it, you’ve played it. There won’t be anything too new if you play through it again. 
That said, this game is awesome. It is a beat-em-up style game with unique bosses and bad story design (as is with any good beat-em-up). These boss fights range from a river ride duel to a game of volleyball. There are even a few moments of PvP sprinkled in if you are playing with friends.
Contrary to what I said above, there is some replayability. If you play with a new person having already beaten the game, you can simply select a new character and be on par levelwise with your friend. The magic on each character is generally different in some aspect.
The best part in my opinion is the difficulty scaling and XP system. You are awarded XP when you HIT an enemy, not just when you kill one. In co-op, this system rewards you for attacking, not just stealing kills from a friend. The difficulty scales hard starting at (I think) Dark Moon and again for the final sequence. 
All in all, this is a great game and well worth the buy. Even better with friends."

5406,"Castle Crashers is a fun indie game. It's a hack-and-slash that is very enjoyable with friends. The gameplay is simple but works well, the only negative i can think of is that you should expect lots of button mashing here and there. It's relatively short, but there's a lot of characters, pets, and a few challenging achievements that you can unlock.

I think what made this game iconic/memorable was the unique art style from Behemoth, the soundtrack and all the funky boss battles in this game. Definitely an indie classic."

5410,"Very fun game and you can replay it multiple times if you want better characters. After you beat the game, you can play insane mode if you want more of a challenge. There's lots of pets and weapons that you can find in levels or buy with coins. Certain levels can be a bit annoying if they have too many enemies, but otherwise it's worth buying."

5447,"Play alone, friends even with stranger too. This game for me is great cuz either i have to use my brain or go ham on the buttons.

My pal got this game for me and i liked it ever since... I only have like a few hours of game time but hey, still good."

5449,2d is fun
5450,"Great game! 


It kinda sucks that I will have to finish it on my own. 
(I'm still playing the campaign at the time the review is being posted and written).

I'm also happy that the game hasn't changed after these 13 years.
 Even tho it doesn't feel the same as playing on a Xbox360 its still as good as it was.

5451,I like to watch my neighbours while they are picking cotton. Does this make me a bad crasher?
5452,its cool
5453,Fun game to play solo and with friends. A mindless kind of game but some of the bosses can be tough so you need to level up or have help on some levels. Family friendly as well.
5454,"One of my most favorite childhood games, been playing it ever since I found out 9th-12th grade existed"
5455,very poggular :)
5456,"get out of negative reviews and get the game

you wont regret it"
5457,"Easy to pick up but a challenge to finish, great to play with friends in person or online!"
5458,"Overall just a really good game, especially for its time. I love the goofiness of the game and the humor of the developers. It's just a really fun game to casually play with friends."

5467,fun
5468,"This game is honestly amazing. My favorite about the game is the art style as it really brings out what the game is made for. This game can also be replayed so many times such as its insane mode and all the characters you have to unlock. Another thing that makes it replayable is you requiring to go back to levels to find pets and weapons you couldn't unlock before. The game can be tedious at times with enemies spamming the bow, spells and whatnot. Other than that, the game is great and would recommend playing it. 10/10"

5473,"good
"
5474,"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Yesssssssssss Very Nice, Can I have a bittttttttttttttt????????????????????????????????????"
5475,"The quality of the game is much lower than Battleblock Theater.  This side-scroll game’s battle is a bit boring and hit impact is not done properly.  

Back off barbarian is a very difficult achievement.  It is a mini game and the required survival time to get the achievement is very high.  A lot of practice is needed to reach the target."
5476,"NICE GAME
"
5477,Lacked compelling elements for me. It just didn't hold my interest.
5478,"Definitely a great ""summer grind"" game for people who enjoy achieving everything possible in a game. It was a very goofy/cartoony game that at first appeared to appeal to children, but as you soon find out, the gore and some of the game's topics can appeal to everyone of all ages. Even playing this in 2021 when the jokes would be considered ""outdated,"" the little boy inside of me still laughed at the poop jokes. This game is not only very fun and is exactly what I'm looking for in a game, but also reminds me of the days of being a child long ago. Would definitely suggest this to anyone, but especially adults/young adults who grew up on Newgrounds/Flash Games and are in need of nostalgia trip."
5479,just this game itself is fun with or without friends will definitely recommend the only thing is that its the same story  but with diff characters after you beat the game.
5480,yes boai
5481,this game is so cool!
5482,I don't even have to play this game to know its goated!
5483,"very overrated imo
the balancing is shitty, the netcode is questionable, and i'm personally not a fan of the gameplay even without these problems"

5496,is fun innit
5497,"The beat em up to end all beat em ups. This game is absolutely incredible, I can't believe it's been a decade since I first booted it up, it's still just as much fun now as it was back then. The gameplay is perfect, the art and visual style is up there with my all time favorites, the soundtrack is lively and fitting, the plot is both hilarious and easy to follow without ever really throwing itself in your face at all, etc etc. While very entertaining regardless, this game truly shines in co-op, so definitely find a buddy or three to tag along.  Long story short, this game is a masterpiece, and if you're looking to just kick back and beat the hell out of some baddies after a long day at work, this is the game you want. I will forever be melancholy that there will never be a sequel, hats off to the Behemoth for one hell of a game."
5498,Much fun!
5499,Epic arcade game to play with friends. Its just amazing to see how much times you can die and still have fun

5504,"A remaining reminder of the ""good old flash days""- where newgrounds reigned supreme, where the earliest forms of meme and internet culture first started to truly grow larger, where poop and fart jokes were rather humorous and where sometimes gameplay was as simple as hitting things and getting lucky.

5530,It's just as great on PC as it was on the Xbox 360. Is it deep? No. Is it beautiful? No. Does it even have a mature sense of humor? Definitely not. But it's a great couch co-op game that still holds up. Heavily recommend using an Xbox controller for game play.
5531,it is very fun
5532,Good
5533,i crashed a castle
5534,"Castle Crashers, to me, seems like a version of Charlie Murder with less features."
5535,"This game is incredibly nostalgic. I played this game for massive 8-12+ hour long sessions on my Xbox 360 starting around late 2008 to early 2009. Grinding up levels and playing through the story was such a blast and still is such a blast. Being able to compete with friends in the arena, or in different mini games, Castle Crashers has always been an fun and interesting game."
5536,haha knight go brrrrrrrrrr
5537,Game's good.
5538,"It's a fun multiplayer game to play, and there are a lot of things you can collect and do."
5539,ya
5540,My friend bought me this game so we could play together. We never did.
5541, play now
5542,played it a lot when i was younger and got it on sale for like $2 or something and it was just as great as i remember.
5543,"Tried playing with controller, and kept bugging, couldnt even get outside of the starting castle"
5544,metroid prime for nintendo gamecube
5545,Very pog
5546,If this was the last game left on earth then I might just play it.f
5547,"Played this game so much on my xbox 360, so I knew I had to buy it once I had my own PC. Classic arcadey hack and slash fun, best enjoyed with friends playing on the same screen! Castle Crashers and other Behemoth games also frequently go on huge discounts! One thing I've gotta say though is that when this game tells you that a controller is recommended, it means it! I'm sure you could get good on a keyboard if you really wanted to, but the game is far more satisfying with a controller."
5548,This is a incredible game and worth all of your money
5549,My girl killed me and kiss the girl i feel broken :(
5550,Noice
5551,many amazing memories were had playing this game <3 if you ever have cash to spear id highly suggest picking this up

5557,"good gameee
"
5558,"Very basic and repetitive gameplay; I can't begin to understand why it's so popular. I mean, I'm glad people enjoy it but I was too bored to continue within about 30 mins. Probably fun for a group of younger kids playing together, or maybe as a drunk party game or something? Other than that I'd avoid or at least try a demo first."
5559,"This game is an absolute gem. So I'm a recent player and have played through this game twice and have enjoyed the ever loving hell out of it. 
Pros:
-Stupidly good soundtrack (Seriously listen to it it's good as hell)
-Amazing character selection (troll boyo not there tho :( )
-Great bosses (I'm looking at you Necromancer)
-Art style looks gorgeous (But you probably expected that from Behemoth)
-Easy to invite friends to play even if they don't have the game 
-Stats for characters 
-Good humor (ha ha poop jokes go brrrrr)
-Level up system as a reward for beating up enough enemies (Finally something useful)
-The arena mode to challenge your friends (Don't worry it won't ruin any friendships, I hope)
-Nostalgia 100
This isn't a part of the game but I'm including it anyways because of how good it is 
-The god-damn COMMUNITY, filled with nice people and an easy way to make close friends/ there's also artwork as well
-Xbox 360/1 controller support for people not willing to play on just a keyboard (To which I mean some, I mean 99% of the community)
-Multiple weapons and animal orbs for your pleasure (My personal favorite is the eye)
Cons
-Insane mode is a bit too hard to do by yourself
-Exact same levels over and over again 
-Playing online can be a pain in the ass sometimes as you can be matched up with people that have 2 bars of service
Overall if you're looking to buy this game I definitely recommend buying it for a good time by yourself or with friends (Don't play With Anyone online tho)
This was my first ever review feel free to comment anything I missed or didn't touch on"
5560,"This is a cool game to play with your friends or to play by yourself, and with all the different characters, the replayability is great. I played this game a lot on my Xbox 360 growing up and once I found it on steam I got it immediately and it did not disappoint. Would 100% recommend"

5570,"i loved this game when i played it on my xbox 360, i love how the game is the same and didnt kill it with updates"
5571,"Fun for four, not one. Every level designed for four players. Play by yourself and get slaughtered every time. They could program enemies but not friendly bots?"

5573,can i have it for free?
5574,amazing
5575,the classic

5614,"one of the best games i have ever played. this game is my childhood .
I remember re-playing the demo over and over again.
some years later i saw this game here and decided to buy it
and let me tell you i didn't regret it. In short this game is amazing and 
if you are considering buying it I would strongly reccomend you buy it"

5621,VERY GOOD
5622,"Good game, so many mechanics to work on even after completing the game multiple times."

5628,kiki yt
5629,This game is a classic and I still play it even now years later because no game is quite like this one.
5630,One of my fav game of all time I loved all feature I finished this game with one of my friend its just a 10/10 for me it worth those 15 euros
5631,"i want to kill my self
:)"
5632,"The best hack n' slash or beat em up game ever. There are literal knights that have crystal shaped heads, try to rescue 4 princesses by defeating the boss fight and beat each other to sacrifice a kiss. You can pick and choose from 100+ selection of weapons or pets that each have an ability to save your knight. Very addicting but sadly the multi-player doesn't have active players anymore unless you find friends to play the co-operative mode. One thing to say is that except for the story mode, you got arenas where you PvP your friends, Finding more treasure chests to reach the lead OR you have an interesting game-mode where you control your character like dance dance revolution but you have to avoid the enemies that try to stomp you! Very interesting game and It's worth playing with your friends or playing with yourself that will make it the hardest."
5633,Best game ever.
5634,"I''ve played this for tons of hours on xbox, and got it during the summer sale just for funsies. This game is sooo good. The combat is great, with the juggling system that's easy to learn but hard to master. Magic is fun too.(although I wish unlockable characters had more unique abilities) Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone (especially if you have friends to play it with, playing couch co-op with friends on xbox was insanely fun)."
5635,Great coop game for all ages
5636,number 1 game now when are we getting a second 1 haha
5637,"Very good game. Fighting hard bosses, grinding, action, character choice and classes, but it's very strange trying to load the game up."
5638,"This game is a fun late night game with a friend but you can play alone. This is a old game but still feels and looks amazing it runs fine

[u] [b] TIP JUST BUTTON SPAM TO WIN [/b]"
5639,"I think this game is a really well made game because this a long, but not really long story game, and this is a fast paced game based on action. There are various characters you can unlock, each good on their own class and purpose, and this game has a really good structure and is very fun to play. This game is a very high recommendation from me, and is worth every penny."
5640,Absolutely fun to speedrun and play.

É um beat em up bonitinho, com controles divertidos q me faz lembrar um pouco dos meus wombo combos do smash bros heuehuehuehuehe. A trilha sonora pode não ter tantas mas minha nossa elas me marcaram demais nos tempos q o meu irmão jogava no xbox 360...
Eu n tenho tanta experiência com o multiplayer no momento mas deve ser mt bom também, considerando um dos jogos mais acessíveis para todos já q é bem leve e acontecem promoções malucas de 5 reais."

It's also fun as hell, gather some friends for more fun.

Do not play Insane mode. Do not play Insane mode. Do not play Insane mode. Do not play Insane mode. Do not play Insane mode. Do not play Insane mode. Do not play Insane mode. Do not play Insane mode. Do not play Insane mode.Do not play Insane mode.Do not play Insane mode. Do not play Insane mode. Do not play Insane mode. Do not play Insane mode.

THERE IS NO FUN TO BE HAD. NONE. ABSOLUTELY ZERO. I BEAT IT TRUST ME NOT FUN. DO NOT PLAY INSANE MODE."
5670,"It's pretty fun, and you get a nice little feeling of emptiness and regret when you beat insane mode :)"
5671,One of the greatest games of all time.
5672,"This is basically a classic now. Play with friends, or you risk ruining it for yourself."
5673,sex
5674,"It's alright. Worth it on a sale. Fun with friends, but can be boring after 80% of the game. It has some funny moments and the art stlye is great."
5675,"My hours here do not reflect the 100's of hours I put into this game via Xbox360. This game is an absolute classic, filled with memorable bosses, gags, and just generally good gameplay. The game is a good length, complete with great characters and fun abilities (depending on the character chosen). The game is simple but oh so sweet as any good sidescroller should be, even without friends (though with friends obviously makes it that much more wacky and fun), which I find to be a rare case these days. 

Overall, just a solid game, and one you should definitely pick up during a sale (even if it just sits in your Steam library for years)."
5676,"Simple, Get a character that is op, kill enemies, kill boss, obtain lady, repeat until all 4 are obtained."
5677,y e s
5678,"do not touche the floor while fighting troll mother on insane mode, worst mistake of my life"
5679,mmmm pet orb
5680,HMMMMM makes my boner tasty
5681,"its just fucking amazing
"
5682,It's fun
5683,Castle Crashers is a childhood game for me and returning to it on pc was a pretty fun time that brought me back. This game is a classic that definitely deserves a positive review.
5684,swag
5685,"VERY FUN GREW UP PLAYING IT ALOT
"
5686,amazing game with tons of content but 100%'ing this game is something i wouldn't wish upon my worst enemies

5692,"Mac 'n cheese
"
5693,"good
"
5694,my favorite game
5695,"This game is probably one of the most well made games of all time, the story telling is immaculate and the characters are quite possibly the most influential people in my life. I've never wanted to play a game over and over more in my life. Highly suggest"
5696,Great game to pass the time quickly if you are interested in farming type games with difficult enemies
5697,"This is the best game I've ever played I played this game on the 360, but as soon as I heard it came out on steam I ran to buy it. Castle Crashers is so much fun, and I have so many hours of memories with friends battling weird bosses. So in conclusion this game is a must-have for anybody."
5698,yes
5699,good
5700,good game havent finished it yet
5701,"Would have been a fun beat-em-up 20-30 years ago, but the genre feels very dated now.  With multiple people on the screen in coop there is just too much visual clutter, and playing solo isn't all that fun."
5702,fun fun game fun fun yes
5703,good
5704,It is a very fun and addicting game.
5705,my childhood

5712,"YO this game is good
"
5713,"You don't own this game yet? Bloody hell you waiting for, buy it.

Castle Crashers is a simplistic hack&slay sidescroller with humor and an unique newgrounds artstyle. The gameplay is so good, that you are going to replay this with friends, even after finishing teh game for the third time. Take my word, I never replay anything. Never."

5727,"Super bon jeu à faire en coop (2-4), faites pas ça solo, et à faire avec 0 sérieux !
C'est fun, c'est sympa ! Plein de personnages à débloquer pour plein de façons de jouer différentes !

Ah, et c'est plein de références !
PS : Il est possible qu'en jouant en coop, vous """"""perdiez"""""" votre amitiés avec vos ami(e)s. Vous verrez.

5730,"I got gifted this game to play with somebody and damn, this game is great I bought it on my macbook and whenever I have some spare time after work I might play this game with some friends, this game has caused for some funny moments and hard challenges it's an overall great game but it does get a bit repetitive once you have finished the game with insane mode being the exact same thing! The PvP is great but very little to no people play the PvP 4.5 stars great game would recommend!"
5731,"I'm not blinded by the rose tinted lenses of nostalgia when I say this, this game is absolutely a masterpiece forged by the developers from newgrounds this game is a true bundle of passion created by people we idolized as heroes in the 2005 online gaming sphere this game goes on sale for around 5 bucks so pick it up when you got the chance"
5732,"Great game especially for coop. Amazing gameplay, music and artwork. A modern classic of its genre."

5743,"Amazing game. One of the first games I ever bought (way back on PS3) and I've loved it ever since. Absolutely amazing experience, especially with friends."
5744,Repetitive gameplay but still fun to play especially with friends
5745,It very epic magic go boom boom and i recommend
5746,brilliant game overall but my only problem is how easy you can get stun locked other than that its very good
5747,One of the best games to play and kinda too hard when doing the insane challenges but overall great game!
5748,Yes.
5749,Loved this game! It's fun to play with a friend! It's too bad you can finish playing the game in a day or two. I really wanted to play more of it. A highly recommended game especially if you're looking for a game for you and your friend to enjoy :)
5750,masterpiece.
5751,no castl e
5752,"Castle Crashers is a really bad, boring, horrible, dog shit, non-innovative, IQ declining, seizure inducing, hemorrhoid aggravating, flu-like, cancer giving, abortion receiving game. Strong 1/10."
5753,I think this game is very fun and enjoyable and should be played by little kids.
5754,I played it when I was 7 and it is still good after all this time
5755,yes

5772,Very fun! Wasn't overly difficult to advance and doesn't require much grinding.
5773,sword funny
5774,"after beating the game i can once again say just how good this game is. i have experience with this game as i have beaten it on xbox once before, so i barely struggled with any of the bosses. the game design is AMAZING, and i also love that there's a lot of stuff to collect, such as weapons and animals. the gameplay is really great, unlike some other games i have played in the past. the one thing that im not a big fan of is that it doesn't save your progress after every level/bossfight. it makes sense that it saves after every section/environment of the game, but i didn't enjoy having to rebeat the 3 bosses before the final boss after my game crashed (due to my lackluster laptop). but other than that, i 10/10 recommend this game, and the price of this game is pretty decent. off to insane mode!"
5775,bro this game is just super fun and it really never gets boring ive been playing this game since i was little and its just super fun

Cons - Insane mode [spoiler] the difficulty spike of insane mode even with max stats [/spoiler]
"
5787,I hate myself

I have played for quite some hours with her/replayed it with her and it's just a great game to pick up every now and then."

5882,a game u can play with friend & family after work. very chilling game.
5883,yeah
5884,YES
5885,"Although this game is well over a decade old, it is still absolutely fun and still holds up today in terms of its humor and quality. Bear in mind that after you finish the main campaign for the first time, it becomes sort of a grind-fest with the plethora of unlockable/DLC characters, repetition of levels you've already played, and not to mention 'Insane Mode'. I would highly recommend it if you like side-scroller beat-em-ups and are in for hours of some good entertainment-- this game never disappoints on that end."
5886,very fun
5887,"This is a great example of a game were you're simultaneously working with and against you friends, but still a good game"
5888,Played this at launch date on xbox 360 now on pc and its pretty much the same. Pretty cool shit.

5896,"CASTLE CRASHERS

Honestly.. this game is a masterpiece Beatum Up by the guys over at Behemoth Games.

If you have never heard of this gem pick it up and play with friends, it really is perfect, really hilarious fun, can't think of one bad thing.

Solid fun for a great price as it goes ok sale often!
Pick it up for sure

5913,"Another game I played through with my kids (ages 7-10)-- very enjoyable throughout, albeit challenging at times for the little novices :)  Humor was occasionally crass and fecal-focused but generally enjoyable.

A solid side-scroller beat-em-up with the added advantage of character leveling to help you ""grind through"" those tougher fights (I'm looking at you, Sock Puppet...).

An easy pick-up for several hours (5-15 depending on skill) of cartoonish mashing.

5974,"1. What the game is like
Its a lot like magica if you've every played that but better art style more funny and FEELS good to play but the combat/strategist is't as good as magica and its not quite as broken as magica for better or worst.
2. Replayability
Playing the game multible times with a different character and one of the following is fun: with some kind of challenge run, with a friend or 3 or trying out the difficult insane mode. Finely going back through on a finished profile collect all the colectables is a great way to get a few more hours too!"

6017,"Judul Permainan   : Castle Crashers®
Pengembang        : The Behemoth 
Penerbit                : The Behemoth
Durasi (HLTB)       : 7 jam

Kali ini saya akan mengulas dengan singkat sebuah permainan yang juga singkat yaitu Castle Crashers®. Game ini adalah game Co-op yang dimainkan hingga 4 orang. Permainan ini mengambil tema Hack and slash, dengan latar abad pertengahan yang dicampur fantasi.

Game ini merupakan game bertipe side scroller karena kemajuan game terus ke kanan. Game ini tidak benar-benar 2D karena anda bisa berjalan ke segala arah tetapi hal yang membuat tampak 2D adalah sudut pandang kamera .Musuh-musuh yang ada di game ini berbeda-beda sehingga tidak membosankan. Selain musuh yang beragam, hal ini juga berlaku untuk senjata dan peliharaan. Hal yang saya sukai dari permainan ini adalah sistem multiplayer yang mudah dan kerja sama yang menyenangkan dalam permainan seperti menghidupkan teman dan membantu memukul. Sayang sekali di negara saya seringkali ditemukan lag dikarenakan jaringan internet, dan kontrol untuk keyboard cukup sulit mengingat hitbox yang sulit dijangaku dikarenakan sudut pandang ini. 

Game ini saya rekomendasikan untuk orang yang mencari game co-op yang cukup seru dengan durasi yang pendek. Tetapi sebeum itu pertimbangkan mengenai kontrol game ini, saya sarankan menggunakan controler. Bila anda ingin mencoba bermain dengan player random, saya kurang menyarankan karena matchmaking cukup sulit didapat dan mungkin mendapat orang yang hanya merusuh.

(English by Google Translate)

Game Title           : Castle Crashers®
Developer            : The Behemoth
Publisher              : The Behemoth
Duration (HLTB)   : 7 hours

This time I will briefly review a game that is also brief, namely Castle Crashers®. This game is a Co-op game that can be played by up to 4 people. This game takes the theme of Hack and Slash, with a medieval setting mixed with fantasy.

This game is a side scroller type game because the progress of the game continues to the right. This game is not really 2D because you can walk in any direction, but what makes it look 2D is the camera angle. The enemies in this game are different so it's not boring. In addition to a variety of enemies, this also applies to weapons and pets. What I love about this game is the easy multiplayer system and the fun cooperation in the game like turning on friends and helping to hit. It's a shame that in my country we often find lag due to the internet network, and the control for the keyboard is quite difficult considering the hitbox is difficult to reach due to this point of view.

I recommend this game for people who are looking for a co-op game that is quite exciting with a short duration. But before that consider about the control of this game, I recommend using a controller. If you want to try playing with random players, I don't recommend it because matchmaking is quite difficult to come by and may get people who just mess around.

This game is one of the most fun games ever with friends and the replay-ability factor is insane. I could play this game forever and never get bored. The artstyle is probably my favourite artstyle of all time the worldbuilding is some of the best in fiction and the final boss is kinda meh but the Necromancer is a perfect video game boss. He has a great soundtrack, a cool design, and a difficult fight. I rate this game a 10/10 in fun factor."

6065,"This game is the best game. It's amazing to play with friends, challenging to play by yourself and rewarding every time you best a new boss in combat. The necromancer fight is by far the most difficult and really tests how skilled and smart the player is whereas the final boss tests the speed and reaction time of the player. Each boss works differently to provide a challenge while subtlety teaching the player fundamental skills needed for later on in the game. Not only this but you have a chicken weapon MASTAPEECE, I give Castle Crashers a 3 outa 5 very good, challenging and fun - IGN"

6112,BUYER BEWARE: This is not the same easy fun game you remember playing. They've definitely tweaked the enemy difficulty way up with no way to change it. I'm not sure if they changed the AI as well but be prepared to be constantly knocked down on the ground  by arrows.  Also the game is designed to be played multiplayer. Good luck getting through the volleyball level solo without breaking your controller. It's a shame they ruined this classic. I haven't raged this hard in a long time.

6120,it was very good yes
6121,"Very nice game
"
6122,"Castle Crashers is an obnoxious beat-em-up with an infantile sense of humor and story-telling, featuring a character leveling system to offset poor design. Levels vary from sections of super-easy mobs with too much health, heavy-hitters that ignore your hits and suck to fight unless you're playing co-op, gimmick sections that go on too long, and final bosses that are sometimes fun but often also go on too long. All of the character powers suck.

All of this points to a game designed for groups of players primarily and with single-players as an afterthought. I prefer to play on my own, and from my perspective this game is just tedious. If you like to spend your play time grinding and find extended, forced poop jokes funny, this is probably for you."

6133,"Castle Crashers is one of my personal favorite side-scrolling beat-em-up style games. In Castle Crashers there is a surprising amount of depth to the combat. There are many funny moments, although it can get childish sometimes. My only complaint about the game is that the depth perception very difficult to understand. This can cause frustration for certain levels, but it is not very often. Castle Crashers is much more fun when it is played with friends. It is worth at least one playthrough."
6134,"good game. 
"
6135,"It is a very fun game: hard, easy it really matters on how to play. There are a lot of bosses and really fun ones too."

6143,"Battle Royale has some repetitive minigames, yes. But most of them are quite varied and different. Additionally, it was the first Kirby game to have abilities in a 3D traditional-Kirby space.
Also had a bunch of unique hats, alot of good music, some fun modes, etc
Story Mode was boring I agree
but for what BR is I find it fun"

6172,"well if i had to start some were i will start here this games art and how it looks looks so long it looks like i was drawn in 2021 and it was made in 2008, the sound track is something you could listen to for days and dosent get old so when you beating people you always have a bop in the background and with beating people the gameplay sooo lord the game play you can play it casually by pressing heavy attack and light attack but you open a new world, and there is so much you can replay this game for so long because when you beat the game you get a new character and then a new one when you beat it as that one, the level up system is go good too strength agility magic and defense and you can make it even or go all in one every 5 points in magic you get a new ability too so you have that to look forward to! {unless your my friend fire how but all his points into agility  and didint do anything else when given the option to} and the4 bosses are so fun and when you beat them you get 100 coins and {sometimes} get to kiss one of the 4 princesses i like the 4th one the best and with bosses they are so fun...except the ice king he can burn in hell, but in all this game is super fun and you should play it"

6214,Silly Game
6215,"This game is amazing. I found nearly everything about the game simply amazing. The combat is great, with combos, magic, and...arrow. every character has different and unique magic, unlocked by doing difficult arenas. The bosses were both challenging, and really fun. All of the weapons made sure you could make a build however YOU choose. And the story is so simple, you don't need to know everything about it just to enjoy it. Although you can play with friends, The game makes the levels and bosses slightly harder so everyone does their part. ...and the arenas can ruin your friendships. Just, If you like 2D Fighting games, Ruining your friendships, and great bosses, You should 100% get this game."

6274,"Castle Crashers is an amazing game I first played on PlayStation 3 way back in the day during its original release. Very fun hack'n'slash that is even funner when you add your friends to the mix. Highly recommend, still lives up to today's standards. Absolutely hilarious and challenging levels keep you on your toes and moving forward. Pick it up!"
6275,Fun Multiplayer Game.
6276,ye
6277,play because u will like
6278,nice game to play with friends
6279,wish i had friends to play with
6280,"İts fun to play wtih friends...Not in insane mod

6281,"One of the best games to play with friend if u want chilled night.

                                         8/10"

6286,"Very fun game, Recommend to someone who has friends (if you don't, don't worry to much, it still fun though, it will be a bit lonely ) and someone who can play this game over and over again since you need to beat specific character to unlock another character"
6287,Played since xbox and stilla great game
6288,"castle crashers is one of those games where you pick it up for the hell of it and invite a few friends and can spend days playing together. the game is packed with fun ranging from challenging levels to hilarious desync moments. bugs and all, the game is incredibly fun. with the quirky characters and captivating gamplay you can get lost in the game for hours and not realise how long has passed until your mom yells at you for being up at 4:30 in the morning on a manday. with the game being fairly inexpensive and only being around 200 ish megabytes, theres no reason you should pass up on the game. if you have a spare $15 USD, or even less during sales, id highly recommend putting it into castle crashers."
6289,"i got fucked over with the other person i was playing and he let me finally have the final princess
would still fuck even if it wasnt what i expected"

6328,hours of fun
6329,"Got it 3 days ago and already have 33 hours of playtime. The style is great and cartoony, the humor is actually pretty funny, and the music is top notch.

6347,good
6348,good
6349,"A guy like me can appreciate a good castle, and the art of crashing is ONE STEP TO FAR. This review will delve into the ethics of crashing castles along with the fact that these crazy fellows are just way to rabbid to stay together. The fart and poop jokes GO WAY TO FAR. so maybe next time you think of ""crashing a castle"". You will think way harder. anyways yeah this game probably had a postive test for HIV."
6350,gabriel is a cock monkey (XykronGamer)

6423,"great game to play with friends, or even just by yourself
very simple and fun"
6424,"I bought the game for me and my friends and, despite me having terrible internet, we all really enjoyed playing the game."

6428,I gave my Red Knight a light saber so he can be a Sith Lord.
6429,the sandwiches have steroids
6430,wanna play castle crashers
6431,"this game is harder than my penis

and half life"
6432,Godly game
6433,I really enjoy this game for simple reasons of a completionist I really enjoyed playing through the game multiple times unlocking all the characters because you'd get to see what there magic looks like and his texture I guess but the main part is you can feel the pay-off when taking a lot of time unlocking a character and grinding him to a high level.
6434,its game hmmm
6435,"This game feels like an arcade game, simple yet incredibly fun. The game is much better with more players, but it's definitely fun whichever you choose to play. The characters are incredibly charming and vary the gameplay in pretty cool ways. If you like Geometry Dash you'll enjoy this soundtrack
Have fun!"
6436, best game
6437,crash some castles mess around with friends and have some trouble going through insane mode its all fun!
6438,beat up castle
6439,this game is really fun and addicting
6440,"Good game, can be repetitive at times but overall was a good couch co-op to play casually. Also flashed moments of great humor in the writing and character animations."
6441,"With as many hours as i have put into this game, i felt obligated to leave a review. What can i tell you that you dont already know. this game is a MASTAHPIECE 10/10"

6447,"Good game, fun bosses, good with friends"

6455,"It's a classic, very funny, entertaining and offers just the perfect amount of difficulty. This game can be enjoyed playing on your own, or with up to 3 friends! 4 players total!  If this hasn't found it's way into your steam library I would pick it up especially when it's on sale!"
6456,if this game taught me anything its to wear protection 10/10 would do it again

6472,"It was good fun, but little short."
6473,"Let's say hypothetically the antagonist had taken the knights' eggs. Now, according to Angry Birds law, they will now never stop. They are now crashin' and bashin' across the kingdom in one of the most fun, nostalgic games I've ever played."
6474,"This is my first review on steam, that is how much I love the game. I first played it with a friend on his Xbox and I enjoyed playing so much that I decided to get an Xbox with Castle Crashers on it so we can play in separate rooms. I had so much fun playing it! The lore, the characters and their powers, it was an easy yes to spend 2 dollars for the dlcs on steam. The reason I bought it on steam though was because it was during the summer sale, (I got it for like 2 dollars) and I wanted to remote play with a couple of other people on steam. I'm not lying when I say this is one of the best games ever!"
6475,YEEEEEEEEEEEE
6476,hot game

6503,"awesome game especially with friends 
"
6504,"i always hated this game since the xbox 360 version. the online mode is broken, the game will get you stuck on joining someone's lobby. you have zero control when you host your lobby, meaning that the other players get to pick what level they want to play. too many high ranking cheaters and d bags that ruin the online fun. the only good thing is the soundtrack. overall, terrible game"

6639,Good ole fun of beat up with enough variations that makes the game interesting
6640,"This game was a huge part of my childhood on the PS3, playing with friends and family. The art style is fantastic and the gameplay is super satisfying. The difficulty ramp of Insane Mode is quite considerable and although it's just a health and attack steroid, it is enough to challenge you. Unlocking all the different knights is quite a grind, which feels pretty satisfying to finish. Nostalgia alone was a good reason to pick up this game, but it definitely stands the test of time and still feels good to play."
6641,It's a very fun game.

"
6779,"Castle Crashers was the very first video game I ever saw. I went on to absolutely love it, and watch a ton of videos on it when I was young. About 7 years later, I got it on Xbox One, beat the game on normal mode and insane mode, and couldn't get enough. I also beat the game on Nintendo Switch. For some reason, I was never able to get Necromancer. Necromancer was my first favorite character in a video game, and remains one of my most favorite video game characters of all time to this very day. Castle Crashers is an absolute masterpiece, and is easily in my top 5 most favorite games of all time. 11/10 - Go check out this game, it's amazing."

6845,yuh
6846,i didnt beat the ninjas
6847,Classic
6848,Its pretty good except it lags a lot in multiplayer
6849,this game was the most fun to play on the xbox 360 with friends back in 2010 and it still holds up today with some great dlc and a good storyline
6850,"I have massive nostalgia for this game. I played it with old friends on their xbox 360, as the game that was deemed ""too violent"" in my house. I fucking loved it to death, and remembered it being really fun. around a few months ago, my friend bought me and two others a copy of the game so we could play it again. aannnnd the online didn't fucking work and there was a massive amount of lag rendering the game unplayable. is it just me? or has this happened to others? but, the issue was so bad I refunded the game and didn't look back since. I hope I can play it again one day, with minimal lag, and with all my best pals. But, until that game comes, I'm giving this game a negative rating for not functioning as intended. The behomoth, if you somehow see this, pls fix your online and offline input lag."

6860,yes
6861,really good game recommend it to all gamers
6862,Glagle
6863,is good！
6864,It's pretty good.
6865,"Very colorful but simple game. Better if played with friends, and not for the gameplay, because this game is the most basic beat-em-up with not much of a story. There is slight humor to it and you don't really need much thought put into the game to play. This is a kind of game that you can replay, but it isn't much fun solo. As far as achievements go, a lot of them rely on multiplayer, and spending a lot of time doing multiplayer, and since the game is pretty old by now, there aren't many people playing, so again, family and friends is the best you'll get."
6866,"Very fun and very silly, fantastic game"

6906,"[h1]Not much of a review; more of a reflection: [/h1]

I remember playing Castle Crashers with the bois back on the xbox 360 in 2008; we were in high school and we were, for all intents and purposes, still very much children ourselves. We had a great time hacking and slashing our way through the games looney art work and enemy design. We unlocked some of the end game characters and weaponry and then, soon enough, we were on to other things. Like graduating, college, women, etc...you know, getting on with our 'real' lives. 

WELL...

Fast forward 13 years and that whole 'gettin' on with my real life' thing has, oddly enough, led me  to currently revisiting this title. [b]Only this time, I'm playing it with my kid![/b] To my disbelief, Castle Crashers has stood the test of time as one of the better couch co-op games available and provides just as many smiles in 2021 as it did in 2008.

It's oddly nostalgic to remember the times with the bois as a young pup; the hooting. hollering and high fives. Now, it's absolutely insane to me that after over a decade I'm able to get a whole new compilation of memories that are very much of joy and laughs, hoots and hollers, high fives and fist bumps with my own kiddo. 

So thanks to 'The Behemoth' for creating a game that's been enjoyable to me both as a cynical, edge-lord teen and now as a loving family man. 


...who knows...maybe one day I'll be playing it with my grandchildren :)"

6914,"I love this game. It is just great. I got this game and battleblock theater (review coming soon) in the ""can't stop laughing bundle"" . This dose not live up to the name of the bundle because I only laughed around 2 to 3 time. The bundle should be call the the behemoth or Tom Fulp bundle. But one to the real Review. The game plays as a hack and slash scroller and one of the best I have ever played. Game play:10/10 The art style has that classic new grounds look. art style:9.5/10 The music can be some of the best and meh-est music I have heard in a game because half the time the music is a bop but the other half the sound so same-y to every other game ever but it's is alright. music:5/10 . Now I will talk about the side games aka The arena and back off barbarian. The arena is just a non stop wave after wave of enemies you get different arena styles the more you get into the game but I just don't care for it because if I want to fight enemies I will just play the main game and if that gets boring after I beat it I can play insane mod. Arena:4/10 Back off barbarian is the weirdest side game in a hack and slash game. It is to weird to explain with words how to play but I will do my best. So in the up,down,right, and left direction a square with a arrow and you need to press the same arrow but barbarian will some and try to kill you and you just need to doge the for as long as you can. It's fun but I feel like it is more of a mini game than a side game. back off barbarian 6/10 side games over all:5/10 I won't talk about the multiplayer because I played it by myself so multiplayer ???/10 (it just depend on who you play with) So over all the game is a 7/10 and would I recommend you buying it  I say buy it in a bundle were are to bundles being the can't stop laughing and the one that comes with pit people (Each I don't plain on reviewing because it isn't my type of game) and the dlc. So you can get two games and extra stuff in the games. I will only go over the extra stuff you get from buying battleblock theater. If you own battle block theater you get a new playable character in the from of hatty and a sword and a pet being the golden whale that are only obtainable with owning battleblock theater. I am going to now quickly go over the dlc being pink knight and the black smith both of them come with there respective character and 4 exclusive weapons each and the price for them is 0.99 Which is reasonable so I recommend buying these along side the game. Dlc10/10 overall the game is a 8/10."
6915,"good game, don't own it"
6916,"castle crashers is a game about color bois saving their respective waifus of that color as for me who plays green boi it was easy to get my waifu but you also have to get the others

You will probably have more fun than I did (which was still a lot of fun) playing it with friends"
7055,pretty nice
7056,I had a fun time playing this with friends. The only bad thing about the game is that I remember that I was adopted while we were playing. Kinda sucks but yeah it happens
7057,"Castle Crashers is probably one of my favorite games of all time. It's a mix of exciting gameplay, a cute art style, unique character design, and a whole bundle of fun (especially with friends)! And my only gripes are all due to how bad I am at video games (how do I use a controller again???). I know I only have a few hours on the game so far, but there's already a lot to love about it!

The gameplay is exciting and filled with unique bosses and difficult levels that keep the game from being too easy. Replayability is endless due to the wide range of unlockable characters who have unique abilities, different gamemodes, unlockable difficulties, and the four-player multiplayer. Hopefully your friends aren't assholes though, because there's a lot of ways to lovingly mess with people in multiplayer. Lastly, I personally love the artstyle and characters. It's adorable while still effectively conveying senses of strength, evil, and fear for bosses and other characters in that vein of characterization.

I absolutely recommend this game to anybody who's looking for a fun little beat-em-up game and isn't planning on dropping their whole wallet on it. It's almost a crime how cheap this game is when you look at how high the quality is. I'd also recommend The Benemoth's other games, such as BattleBlock Theatre, because I've heard the same praise for their other games as I have for this one."
7058,"Played this in co-op with a friend and it was just a joy!
Holds up after so many years.
Would be a fun ""family game night"" game."
7059,"Hours of fun for you and your mates, honesty!"

7070,Don't even bother buying this if you intend to play with friends. It freezes every 20 seconds which completely ruins the entire experience. Not to mention enemies are just spammed at you so there's no strategy to it. Just mash X and Y. Only reason this game has overwhelmingly positive is because people are blinded by nostalgia.

7078,"A boring, unpolished beat em up leaving most to pour half their gold into buying potions to tank fights that have cheap ai or waiting as others just drag on for minutes on end, even with someone to help you to boot. Just play streets of rage 2 or 4, those are actually good games. I guess the art style can appeal to some, but for me the most enjoyment I got out of this title was the first boss in the final boss gauntlet that spawns a snail but its a nose in a snail shell.
It arbitrarily forces you to get out of a level to find out what some pets do, and it tells you to do the same for melee weapons you find (But just pick them up and swap your current weapon, it shows a small menu FOR YOU that way, imagine the same being shown for pets.) and the red knight's lightning is fucking broken with its good range for its MASSIVE dps.
I wonder how much play testing was done, because in spite it's decent mechanical depth some enemy attacks you don't know you'll be able to block unless you try first to boot.
Also, the end of the game finally showing the orange princess's face being a *silly funny* clown feels like the game made fun of me for wasting my money on this"

7083,"this is a fun game that  is still really good in 2021 but I have played through this game 3 times in insane mode. I get nightmares to this day about industrial castle on insane mode. I be just be doing em combos and then while moving through the air i get hit by a nuke disguised as a bomb and i lose a little bit over 1 third of my hp. Fix insane mode, pee pee poo poo game out of 10. Please eat fruit salad daily because you will get fat after playing for 3 and a half days in seconds. This game is ok i guess if you ignore the fact that it is terrible. Play if you are willing to die irl a day afterwards. Just play that one Block Theatre game it is better and is bad at being better than castle crashers because Blockbuild theatre is bad and castle crashers is really  fun and is one of the best game. I don't recommend Castle Crashers."

7107,"A must have couch co-op game which allows you to play as one of a few dozen characters and fight to save princesses. Each character has different magical abilities but the base controls are always the same so its easy to hop around on. The game also has some pretty fun PvP and is a bit of a classic.

If you're unsure, try the demo with some friends. This is a really social game.

Oh btw michael this game sucks.

<3 <3 ;3"
7133,"Oh when I found out this was on PC, I was so happy!

Pros,

Art style is awesome, aged extremely well and will keep ageing well.
Very funny game, specially with friends, an awful lot of dark humour.
Combat system is simple yet rewarding with an element of strategy.
So much content for £10, now with the included insane mode as well for free.
With friends this game is always a joy.
You can tell an awful lot of love and attention went into this game.
Difficulty spikes that make you want to keep playing rather than quit.
An awesome end battle and great boss mechanics.
Cute pets!
Great selection of weapons!
Animations are always a joy to watch whether it be an NPC death or the small cutscenes.

Cons,

No sequel!
I MEAN COME ON THIS GAME DESERVES ONE!
TAKE MY MONEY!

Pick up 2 copies and play with a friend, you will not regret it, one of the greatest co-op games ever created."

7142,"It's not a terrible game but there are some flaws.
The enemys take way to long to kill and it's not easy to beat the game in single player mode. So friends are requiered.
The gameplay is very repetitive, because you beat up enemies over and over again so it can get very boring after some time.
Graphics and Soundtrack are good though. Still I wouldn' t reccomend it to people, who don't like this gameplay style.

7162,I first played this game on the Xbox 360 and over all I really love the game. The only downside is that I am unable to connect my controller to the game. The graphics of the game seem to have been revamped from the original and I am still yet to try the new game mode. Which I think might be good.

7199,"Fun game although its better with friends and gets boring after a while when playing alone, also any character you play with alone might be the one character you stick with since none of the characters reset as far as I know of and no one likes it when one person is overpowered and the rest are beginners."

7219,"Truly a classic. I remember the days I played this game with my friend after classes back in 2015, still as good to this day. The community might be a bit dead, it is still fun to reset your favourite character and invite 3 other of your friend and rush the game during an afternoon. If you've never played this game, you're missing out."

This is a side scroll game about four different colored knights (in the beginning) fighting against an evil wizard.

7347,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
7348,"yeah pretty cool, you can replay this game at least 10 times and I still find it fun"
7349,"I FUCKING love this game, it is super easy to get into, it's mechanics are fun, the insane mode is very challenging, and overall I've only had a good experience with this game. Even when I played this game alone, I had tons and tons of fun. This game reminds me of why I love newgrounds, it is never afraid to be weird. It doesn't care what others think.

If all you are looking for is a run in and smash some heads it might be worthwhile, but at the end of the day the ''choices'' this game offers are pretty much meaningless and there is really only one viable option, the fights are repetetive and dont bring any intereseting mechanics.

7394,"This was a great game back in 2008.

Now it is horribly outdated, and the rose colored glasses shattered with great force, straight into my eyes. The movements are clunky and unresponsive, story is meaningless and the attempt at being humorous is aggravating. 2D game has been forced into 3D and attacks which have sweeping animations do not hit within the sweep. If you want to keep the great memories, keep them and don't make any new ones."

7411,castle
7412,Excellence. So sad they won't do a sequel while this game is begging for one.
7413,"Recommended for experienced submariners. If you are new to the submarine simulator genre, I highly suggest doing some research on YouTube about the basics of submarine operations/tactics (""Sub Brief"" is a great channel for this). There is also a manual for the game included in the launcher for those that prefer an in-depth read and attention to detail. Playing this game as a total rookie can be very challenging but not impossible for those who are up for said challenge.

Pros:
-Since this game was made by a US Navy submarine simulator developer, you can expect a good deal of realism. What's not entirely realistic to the 688 class submarine is entirely functional and practical. They have made an excellent declassified simulator for the 688.
-The complexity of the game is a perfect balance. Yes, there are a lot of menus and systems to familiarize with and become proficient in. However, it's not all thrown at you at once.
-The missions are straight forward, dynamic, and re-playable. If you prefer stealth, you have every tool at your disposal. If you think you can go loud and fight or outmaneuver your enemies, good luck, the 688 was built for it.

Cons:
-As I stated earlier, beginners be warned! There is a pretty big learning curve and no in-mission instruction. Read the manual, the boat's database, or just brute force trial and error. If you like a good challenge, this is the game for you."

7433,"I have played this game for 120 hours! I still love and still have fun, I've had this game since it came out on the 360, but this is remastered and I had the original but it still feels the same. Please check this game out!"
7434,"This game just has not aged well. Neither have I, but I'll note that I do feel that if I had gotten it when it was released I'd have loved it back then. But now? It really doesn't hold up well at all. It captures a tame post-south parkish humour that was really popular in the late 2000s, which is a bit of a nostalgia trip, but it's not like we lost a great style of comedy when it became less and less popular.

When I was a kid I used to play quite a bit of games through MAME, one of my favourites back then was Knights of the Round. This was a fantasy medieval beat-em-up much like Castle Crashers (with a different sense of humour), and in that game the enemies just aren't punch sponges like they are here - three hits the enemy goes down, and that was an arcade game, made to swallow up your coins! - In Castle Crashers? First you grind till you go insane, and then you must spam-up to 9 or 12 ""heavy"" hits for them to go down. Btw, a little tip: put points into ""magic"", it'll make your life so much easier when dealing with multiple humanoid enemies.

Maybe, I though, I was just doing this wrong, this is a co-op, so get someone else to come along. I tried online, which is a horrible mess, but eventually did a couple of levels with the only person I could find that the game didn't lag into another universe. Still the enemies felt like sponges. Alright, then, let's do some local co-op, just to test it out. Still the same, the experience is a bit better with someone else to throw jokes at, but there just are better games do play in local co-op...

The co-op can't be much of an excuse, the devs could have scaled the enemies to the number of connected players in the campaign. They just didn't care, they wanted to make the game feel longer, so they made the enemies annoying and hard to kill. These short of games usually show an health bar for all enemies, not just the boss, but not here. You never know how close to death your enemies are.

Another thing, this game expects you to grind, and grinding in the aforementioned conditions just isn't fun. The bosses go from obviously easy to just annoying, there's just nothing between those two. Except, maybe the Medusa, she was kind of fun, but that's about it. If you played it back in the day, great for you, hold to those memories, but I wasn't fortunate enough to be blessed with those."

7452,"had this game in my library for the longest time and finally got around to playing it just to clear it. to be honest I thought I'd get a decent experience out of this game initially, but nah. I get that beat-em-ups are typically mindless button-mashing, but most beat-em-ups I've played usually end up being deeper and more fun than this gameplay wise. It's really just not that fun, and whatever difficulty it tries to convey really just comes off as annoying. Also doesn't help that I had to sit through some extended poop jokes early in the game that I just couldn't skip through. I've seen in other reviews that lots of folks enjoy this as a multiplayer experience. I guess I can see that. But as a single player this game is kind of a chore, and the Flash artstyle is really not very charming."

7471,"CASTLE CRASHERS REVIEW

SUMMARY: 9.5/10
GAME TYPE: Beat ‘Em Up/Arcade/Multiplayer
GOOD STORY about  knights with various powers trying to rescue princesses and save the kingdom, although,
THE FOCUS is on simple arcade-style gameplay and great simplistic cartoon graphics
CARTOON VIOLENCE similar to videos seen on Youtube
HIGH REPLAY VALUE! This game never gets old even if you complete it

STORY
The whole plot of the game is your character is sent on a quest to rescue the princesses and save the kingdom. That’s it

CONTROLS
The controls are very simple and easy to use (especially if you have a controller). You can combo attacks and utilize your weapons and magic abilities which you can learn in the menu.

WEAPONS
Each character has a melee weapon such as a sword, a shield, and some kind of magic ability. As XP is earned the player can add to various stats to improve their character.

ART & LEVEL DESIGN
Each level consists of getting from one side to the other while fighting various enemies and usually a boss at the end, all while gaining XP which you can put towards various stats such as strength, speed, and magic. The level designs vary throughout the game, ranging from medieval villages, to thick forests, to desert sands, to frozen tundras. Outside the levels are various shops where you can purchase useful items. There is a blacksmith shop where you can switch weapons and a pet area where you can select an animal companion that will aid your character. The game has a cartoonish style that makes it not only fun to play, but fun to watch as well. The side-scrolling beat ‘em gameplay is reminiscent of arcade games like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

DIFFICULTY & GAMEPLAY
The difficulty of Castle Crashers increases as you progress. The levels will get harder and harder, but your character will level up as well. Going back to older levels really shows how far you’ve progressed (and provides a good way to farm up XP.” Even at full stats though, the final stage is a challenge. You can play by itself but the game is even more fun when you play with your friends.

ENEMIES
Each level has lots of enemies to fight through and usually ends in a boss battle. As your character levels up the enemies become easier and easier to beat. The bosses also become easier as well when you learn their patterns.

HIGH REPLAY VALUE
There is nothing like getting your friends together, getting a handful of controllers, and playing Castle Crashers. Even after finishing the game, the simple controls and style make the game worth coming back to. Theres plenty of hidden secrets and other characters to unlock as well.

Overall, Castle Crashers is a 9.5/10. There could always be room for improvement, but this game is as pretty close as you can get to “perfect.”"

7489,I like game
7490,This game is really good
7491,"Another title I bought and beat on console and later purchased on Steam.

Castle Crashers has a lot going for it - gorgeous visuals, a great sense of humour, great combat and a lot of replayability. For me, the biggest one is replayability.

If you know Behemoth games you probably have a feel for their titles. They remind me of full release Flash games, and I don't mean that in a bad way. Behemoth clearly spend a lot of time getting things looking and feeling right. Castle Crashers, for all these refinements, only has one problem - verticality.

Castle Crashers excels at combat when an enemy is directly in front of your character (to the left or right of the sprite). If an enemy is above or below your character, even a little bit, your attacks have a high chance of missing unless the actual strike hitbox is quite tall. As long as you keep this in mind and pay attention to when you are and aren't hitting your intended target (and using lock-on) this shouldn't be much of a problem for you.

This one issue aside, it's got heaps of characters to unlock, level up, beat the campaign with which in turn unlocks even more characters. Be sure to look up a Castle Crashers wiki after you beat it to see what is really available.

Of course, all of this madness can be done either single player or up to 4 player coop. I believe it can be done both couch coop and online.

So if a cute, simple hack and slash with friends is what you're looking for you can easily put a 250 hours into this one. If you see it on sale it's pretty much a must grab if any of the above sounded good to you."

This game is epic FUN! Bought it in 2021 in a Steam bundled sale @ Rs 136 (another game was BattleBlock Theater, made by the same developer) Kudos to Behemoth Games for making a game like this. Runs at ultra settings on my potato laptop - Dell Inspiron 5520 (i5-3210M, 4GB RAM, Intel HD 4000 GPU and a 128 GB SSD + Win10). Lovely!

A controller is definitely recommended, however KB&M combo will work with butterfingers too!

Good time-killer with buddies, especially when on sale (rather short, but 10+ hours and medium replayability)! 

STORY
+ Funny throughout, in dialogue and enemy/stage designs
- Not much of a story, but you wouldn't really be expecting one in a casual game like this anyway

GAMEPLAY
+ Easy to pick up controls (game recommends a controller, but is playable with keyboard/mouse)
+ Combos can be satisfying (especially staying in the air/juggling enemies)
+ Very casual, stress free (side scroller beat-em-up)
- The 2.5D element can make it hard to hit enemies sometimes 
- Story / adventure mode can feel a bit short 

VISUALS
+ Simple, classic and nostalgic (throwback to Newgrounds days in the early 2000s!)
+ Stages are unique and all feel different

AUDIO
+ Music and sound effects are quirky and fitting for the casual nature of the game

Overall, a great bargain when on sale, lots of fun and laughs to be had with your buddies here!"

But it's still great. 10/10"
7536,Its a pretty good game. Great fun when played with friends and the variety of weapons and pets to collect make lots of content. The one problem is that a lot of the fights get stale.

Would recommend to all.

7540,Amazing game so many good memories with the Homies 10/10. Would recommend to play with your friends It is a GREAT time. but there is a downside of when you complete the game there is not much else to do.

7562,Funny as crap and also great music.
7563,I played this game for 6 hours straight.

7573,"I absolutely love this game!!!
So many characters in a fun and easily replayable game just makes me really happy, and this game gets LEAGUES better with friends. I'm sorry I can't say much of interest but there's just so much of the game that i love it's hard to specify."
7574,"Awesome journey, and incredible song playlist"
7575,oba.
7576,"Classic game from my childhood. Insanely fun solo and with friends. Gameplay is solid, it feels pretty good and the upgrades feel meaningful. The music is great, and the environments are beautiful. The boss fights are a ton of fun, each one being different from the next. The amount of people you can play as is great too. There are so many characters, weapons and pets, its really awesome. The story is good for such a simple game. Nothing too thought provoking or anything, just enough to make you want to keep playing. The game does a good job of making levels feel epic. I have so many memories of this game for that reason alone lmao. The game was clearly made by passionate people that wanted to make a fun game, and i would say that they succeeded. Id give it a 10/10, i have no complaints with it lol"
7577,its just good
7578,The best game for co-op couch fun.
7579,"Fun and cute game with lots of personality and a cool visual style. Gameplay is a bit too button mashing for my tastes though and playing it alone gets boring quite quickly. Still, for whoever has friends to co-op it's a cool party game."

7590,other than getting repetitive
7591,"So many memories playing this on the good old xbox 360
"
7592,I really wished I liked this game.
7593,"An absolute classic, if you had a 360 there's a high chance you at least played this, game is pretty solid and fun, though to be honest there isn't much content area wise anyway, you can beat the game on a character in about maybe 2 hours, then from that point its just unlocking other characters or insane mode, overall would recommend if you haven't played this somehow. Playing though it with my friends was pretty fun but there was a constant issue no matter what we did, input lag, when me and 1 if my friends tested it the delay was barely there, we tweaked some setting and it worked even better, then the third friend joined and the delay got more noticeable again, then when all 4 of us played the input delay was stupid noticeable and honestly dulled the experience with how bad it was, still pretty solid. 5/10 on pc due to input delay, but if you can fix is easy 9/10"
7594,I still need to beat insane mode after a year
7595,Funny cartoon poop jokes. 69/10 would recommend.

You get to level up skills which increase different abilites.
Strength - Hit harder with the swords
Magic - Hit harder with magic attacks.
Defense - Tank more hits
Agility - Become faster, Hit harder with bows and shoot faster with bow.

There is also a possiblity to find animals which give additional extra support. My favorite is the Pig which give extra health from fruits. These animals are hidden very well through the whole map so have an extra eye for them."

Anyways, I love this game, its very fun and imaginative, I have yet to see something similar to it. It is just a beat em up but its still a good time and a co-op blast."

7716,"Holy fucking shit. I want to bang the castle crashers blacksmith so goddamn bad. I can't stand it anymore. Every time I go to the weapons frog I get a massive erection. I've seen literally every rule 34 post there is of him online. My dreams are nothing but constant fucking sex with the blacksmith. I'm sick of waking up every morning with six nuts in my boxers and knowing that those are nuts that should've been busted inside of the blacksmith's tight anus. Fuck, my fucking mom caught me with the neighbor. I'd dressed him in a purple helmet and went to fucking town. She hasn't said a word to me in 10 hours and I'm worried she's gonna take away my PC. I might not ever get to see the blacksmith again."

7731,"you see, the trading cards in this games first level badge happens to be the green knight. this reflects how FUCKING TERRIB-"
7732,"Story Time.
I was (very) young when I played this game. Heck, this may have been my first, next to Plants Vs. Zombies, an emulated Kirby's Dreamland 3 and Superstar, and a few more that I can't remember. I didn't know what Newgrounds was. The only website I ever visited was PBS Kids. Evidently, I didn't really care about Castle Crasher's ESRB rating.
I often played with my sister on the X-Box 360, and her high-leveled gray knight. It was fun. There were some parts of the game where I struggled, like the Alien Ship, Full Moon, and Necromancer, but my sister cleared them for me. I didn't really experience the game fully, but boy did I like it. I dressed up as the Red Knight for Halloween once. Again, I was very young.
Nostalgia aside, I actually think that this game is good. It's a bit button-mashy, but that only means that anyone can play it. 
There's just enough content to be entertaining for a long time. With a lot of characters and items to unlock, and a great multiplayer mode.
I have a special connection to this game. It was my childhood after all- but if it wasn't good, then I wouldn't be talking about it."

7739,"One of these rare examples of games where I could not tell a single negative aspect, this game is just perfect! Humorous, fast, ever changing due to additional skills, challenging but fair because you can replay several times to overcome those insanely strong apperaring nmys. What fascinates me the most is the extremely innovative 2d gameplay, makes you feel like floating on pink fluffy uniquehorn bubble clouds smooth I mean! Got some handicap though: only got one of these ms sidewinder gamepads, so sadly I don’t have all them buttons equipped :F (magic is missing, im killing meele to that bone).
Tried with keyboard, it aint no phun… possibly will buy a xbox controller soon, just because of this game!

Many thanks Behemoth! – I adore what you are doing - you pwn XOXO
--- having all your other games thrown on my wishlist, intending to play buy/play them through one by one, you are my new favourite franchise; keep this coming!

7750,literally one of the best games ever
7751,"An actual legitimate masterpiece, the complete idea and though of what heart, love, passion and soul is like in a video game. Been playing since 2009 on the 360. Great job Behemoth."
7752,"This game is a fun multiplayer (or single player) game! There are many characters, weapons and pets to unlock and choose from as well! Did I mention that each character has a type of magic! Some of them have similar magic to other character, but most of them have a unique type of magic that fits the character. I highly recommend this game and watch the ending :D"
7753,"An excellent example of how effective an art style can make or break a game.

The soft graphics with soft gore goes incredibly well, especially with the facial expressions of some enemies (especially those bees) creates a wonderful feeling when trying to stay alive.

Though, once you start reaching around level 20 you begin to realise this game is just a X and Y button mash.  I personally do not have the patience to beat the campaign on every character and their evolved characters.

To get the most out of this game, definitely more enjoyable with friends - unbeatable when playing couch co-op."

7802,"I love this game, don't get me wrong, but the behemoth had so much potential to add more levels and more bosses because the main game is the same thing over and over again (you castle crashers veterans would know what im talking about) to the point where it will end up getting boring, they add these little animals around the map but they don't do anything, like the giant fish with sharp teeth in the water, there could've been a 5th princess that the king forgot about but the blacksmith told the player about it, they took her under water and put her in a glass box. you have to get through the under water level to get to the boss, kinda like industrial castle and lava world. then that should've been the part where they introduced the fish from the flooded temple. and why not have the industrial king fight for like a phase 2 that would've made the industrial castle more challenging and you get riches and the spyglass artifact."
7803,"Absolutely one of the best games I've ever played, and worth every cent. 10/10"

7807,Very good Co-op experience.
7808,"Castle Crashers, oh boy where do I even begin? Lets just make this a quickie! Character Selection: Good variety and fun! Story: Simple and Entertaining. Weapons: SPANG! SLICE! AND LIGHTSABER! Baddies: Unrelenting but it'd be boring without them! Your Backup: They come in sizes normal and small, but make a big difference! The OST: LOVE THE CHOICES OF MUSIC FOR THE AREAS!!! The extra mini games: Not bad, but a good addition to the game. I would play Castle Crashers over and over with my friends given all the characters I can unlock and use, however....

Small problems: 
-I wish I knew a way to have a multiple of the same character but not a big deal.
-If I want to play the game again from square one and build myself up again, I need a new character to play. I wish you could play from the beginning with the same character and just have the enemies match your level so you don't feel like an absolute God in the beginning all the time. (I did play on console before PC so starting fresh built up lots of nostalgia when I began playing again.)
-And finally, not a big complaint at all, just more of like I wish the animal companions were a little more consistent on what they are supposed to do.

7823,A beautiful game. Me and my friends always gravitate back to it for the laughs and battles. I highly recommend you play this with a group of friends because the fun will never end at that point.

7830,This & Battleblock are just on a whole different level
7831,The orange princess reveal is what made it all worth it. She's truly gorgeous.
7832,A co-op classic! Newgrounds signature style really shines through
7833,"Castle Crashers is a very fun side-scrolling beat-em-up title with impeccable graphics and sound design. Verily, it doth be a timeless classic! The game is fun when played solo or with friends (but obviously a little more-so with the latter). The game has tons of unlockable weapons, characters, and alternate game modes that will keep you entertained for hours-on-end. 

My only (minor) complaints are that some enemies seem to take foreverrrr to take down. You can juggle an enemy for a longgggg time only to watch them get back up for more. Also, leveling up all of the character you unlock is a big time commitment - I wish you could just respec the upgrades from one character onto another but beggars can't be choosers and the game is otherwise fantastic as-is. 

Considering the game is old af, pick it up when it's on sale."
7834,monster guys bad at fighting. nerds dont know i beat them easy
7835,"Bloody brilliant 
"
7836,good
7837,My friend bought a four pack(about $12) and sent me a copy of this game it is super fun. This game is just a really fun slasher game to play with your friends. It has a cool level up system and tons of characters you can play. Each time you beat the game with a character you haven't won with yet you gain a new character. You can even play as the enemies you fight against. Also after you beat the game with a character you unlock insane mode where every enemy is basically harder than the final boss on normal mode. Which is supper hard to beat and really fun to play with your friends against. I highly recommend that you get this game.
7838,yes
7839,very pogger yes
7840,This game is so addicting and fun. i just got it 2 days ago and i'm already in love with it.
7841,"[h1] Castle Crashers [/h1]

[b] Fun, But Repetitive For Its Length [/b]

(Warning: Some Small Spoilers)

[b] Castle Crashers [/b] is a title which I had played back with its release on the Xbox 360, and I had never managed to get very far into the game on numerous occasions. It wasn't just the difficulty for me at the time, as I was always getting sidetracked by another game on the side. I finally challenged myself to try and complete this title, and while I can say I am pretty disappointed, I had a pretty decent time with this one.

[b] Castle Crashers [/b] is a beat-em-up with RPG mechanics with a unique, cutesy art style and a bunch of humor to boot. The world is diverse and full of weird and zany characters all trying to either kill each other or achieve some very weird goal. You come across a lot of these characters on the countless raids you take part in throughout the campaign in order to achieve your main goal of saving four kidnapped princesses. Along the way, you'll fight giant mechanical abominations, crazy wildlife, aliens, demons, and loads of enemy soldiers. You and your team of up to three other knights must overcome all odds to save the princesses, the world, and gather as much gold as possible in order to become powerful along the way.

Combat in this game is really simple. Its essentially revolved around striking enemies with your weapon, blocking with your shield, shooting arrows, and using magic abilities. Striking, shield, and bow are all assigned their own button, and the magic button as well, only in its case there are slight inputs needed in order to perform a few extra moves. Each character is signified by their magical element, and their kits are shaped in such a way to diversify them. I found combat to be fine, but there were many moments where you are forced to abuse the game's systems in order to not get abused yourself. For example, many enemies can shoot arrows much faster and more efficiently than you, so it is in your best interest to throw them up in the air and juggle them with damage until they die. In this way, enemies can never hit you, but it requires specification of skill points and extremely repetitive and fast button smashing in order to accomplish. There were more system like this including magical abilities (Blue Knight ranged attack is NUTS leveled up), and it disincentivizes players from diversifying their combos and playstyles. 

This really limited how well the gameplay developed throughout the campaign, and I found myself really bored and annoyed with the combat by the end which is this games real selling point. Thankfully, there is a bunch of humor, interesting boss fights, characters to encounter, and lands to discover that make up for some of the combat shortcomings. A very memorable part of the game involves a large fish battle where you must launch giant cannonballs into its face in order to stun it, all while riding on a log, fish, or shark and wailing attacks into it. Another battle involves escaping from an alien ship, where many aliens akin to that from [b] Alien Hominid [/b] (another of the developers older titles) swarm you by the dozens. Silly encounters like these are what allowed [b] Castle Crashers [/b] to remain memorable for me and many others throughout the years, despite its simplistic combat mechanics.

Customizing your character is sadly a bit disappointing, involving only a very basic stat tree and weapons to equip throughout your adventure. These amount to stat boosts and some occasional elemental effects, but I think they missed the opportunity to add wacky weapon with funny abilities, at least during the initial playthrough. There are some funnier weapons that are unlockable down the line, but it involves many extra hours of grinding gameplay that I was far from interested in after completion. Still, there is a taste of this system in the game despite it being a bit hard to unlock.

The music and sound design is very good! The songs are catchy and quirky, and the sound effects are always timed in humorous ways upon encounters. The developers did a great job aligning the art and sound to maximize the humor of the game, something that is rare of game in general.

Cooperative play is generally the way to play the game, and I played with my girlfriend throughout the campaign. It was a bit harder than I imagine it would be with a four person group, so we sometimes found ourselves in situations where we got our butts kicked. These moments were pretty infuriating for myself, and it generally involved parts of the game where a massive difficulty spike is suddenly introduced. This game could have used a bit of a difficulty reduction for some areas with multiple players involved, and it definitely brought some negativity into our experience that was otherwise very fun.

There are a few extras here in there, such as extra modes and levels to unlock, but I personally didn't feel the urge to explore these very much. It is there for those interested, though I think there isn't much different in these parts compared with the rest of the game.

Overall, I enjoyed my time enough with [b] Castle Crashers [/b] to finish the campaign, but I don't think it is worth a second playthrough. There aren't enough ideas fleshed out for a second playthrough, as many in the first playthrough grew tiring by the end of its run. The game's selling point is its humor and unique characters and combat encounters, but the combat itself it very lacking. It is perfectly above average for a beat-em-up game, and I think that is enough to [b] Recommend [/b] for anyone looking for a fun couch co-op experience.

[h2] Final Verdict: 6/10 (Above Average) [/h2]

The story is really great and the soundtrack is unbelievable . I really love the art style of behemoth and they really nailed this game. You can unlock characters if you beat the game with the starter characters and then again with those characters . You can also get level 99 on every character which is what i'm aiming for. This game is really fun . 10/10 .

7969,"This game is very fun and has replay value, and stays like that for a long time, for sure my favorite game of all time. if you have actual friends it's even better, you can try different character duos or groups like industrialist and fencer, the most overpowered duo ever. If you really like side scroller fighting, you HAVE to experience this.
The game's soundtrack is chef kiss beautiful, and the bosses are well done. There's a total of 27 other characters to obtain, 2 dlc, and 4 to start out with (31 characters in total) each with different magic powers. If you want a harder challenge, consider insane mode once you beat the game normally. Trust me, it gets so much worse. Take this review from a guy that has played this on many different accounts: On steam, redoing it because i reset my progress, two accounts on xbox, and another xbox account on a different xbox."

Now that I've grown up and know how the game works much better, I still enjoy it. I prefer playing with friends over solo, without question, but the game will always be an enjoyable experience for me. Sitting down to play this with the bois (Or girls, I ain't judging) in the same room as everyone and disintegrating everything you come upon with ruthless button mashing throws me back to my childhood, when I didn't have to worry about rent or taxes, sure, but it's fun for people who didn't grow up with it too. A great game to play when you don't want to think and when you an your friends can't settle on anything that requires any level of real skill. Love this game"

8081,A classic beat em up game! This is the superior version to own among all versions of the game!
8082,good game
8083,"Castle Crashers is a very enjoyable beat 'em up that demands skill, patience and punishes you fairly for being careless. Expect the typical button mashing fare, but also expect to think outside the box here and there. The art style is immensely charming, the music is diverse and catchy and there's countless weapons and nifty combat enhancements to discover. However, the game has its tedious grindy moments. Be prepared to replay some levels to boost your abilities higher and stock up on supplies for impending battles. The game is a lot more fun to play with friends, too."
8084,Fun Co-Op with friends. 8/10

I get so much nostalgia from this game, and it's not too late to create memories with your friends!

8128,One of the best game I've ever played and its the one I'm most interested in  and it can also play in offline and online and its multiplayer and its also a lan. That's not all of it there's more you can even got money by playing this game but the step is a little long but don't worry if you are already old comer to steam you'll get use to it and also if you know how to do that making money is easy and about the game all we have to do is boost up our characters and if our character is at maxed level we get to use another character and haven't lost our old character yet so damn cool and not only that when we start the game we get to choose among 4 characters with different magic each.Oh i might spoil the game too much hehe.
8129,A great beat em up that you wanna play again and again. It may be simple but it is fun and their is so much to unlock.

Games like hobo or that purple demon kid with his father idk name. 
And I was playing this game with one of my best friends when we were kids so i had to beat it.
And now I was playing it with my brother with keyboard mouse and gamepad which was helpful to play with 2. I like games soundtrack its like from geometry dash. I like graphics and combo moves.
We were playing on strenght which was worse than magic becouse strongest magic spel can do really good demage.
Somethimes it was hard and so we rage quited.
But then I beated these bosses alone.
Story of 4 kidnaped princes was funny and good.
I like bosses.
Animal orbs are helpful.
Idk what to think about weapons becouse i havent seen more than 6 strenght or 5 idk.
But I love the game.
9/10 becouse somethimes game was too hard."

8157,"I didn't play this growing up and have no nostalgia towards it. I bought it on sale because my friend asked me to play it with him. Honestly, I don't care for it. Gameplay is boring and the controls don't feel good. It might feel better with a controller though. It's also very expensive for a glorified flash game. That being said, it has a free demo now, and I praise the developers for that. Demos are a fast and easy way to negate bad reviews from upset buyers and other developers should take note. I wish there was a neutral review option, because I hate giving good devs a bad review, but I have no choice. The game just isn't fun for me."

8162,"It breaks my heart to give this game a bad review considering this game on the 360 was a huge part of my childhood, but unfortunately this PC port has so many startup crashes and audio issues that it will make you hate your life. It worked out great the first few days but got buggier and buggier, even after a few fresh reinstalls. Ive tried every solution possible and nothing works."
8163,love the game I have nastolgia from playing it on xbox 360 its great here

8165,"Castle Crashers is a side-scroller beat'em up game, where you play as knight and the castle where you in got attacked by evil forces, taking a important stone and four princesses. Your goal is to save them all and take back the stone from the evil mage.

First think I need to praise, is the graphics. It's a cartoon / hand drawn style graphics, really fun and fit for the game. Effects looks really good and sometimes well detailed. Pretty simple for a side scroller game, also the game is fake 3D, which fits right. I will also mention the humor of the game here, because most of them are graphical and those are really good and there are also easter eggs, which really makes the a meme... in a good way of course. I was really into the graphics, however for me the feel of space in the game is weird and sometimes couldn't coordinate in the game, also on some maps (last boss for example) has a really annoying background, which made my eye hurt, but really... the graphics is amazing!

Controls are all right to get into, hard to master it. Responsive, do what it needs to, simply amazing. However, I recommend to play the game with controller, the layout is easier, then the keyboard one... this is a negative aspect in the game kinda, but it's important to mention.

Sound and music part of the game is wonderful. Sound effect are funny, not annyoing or repetitive, also sometimes changes the whole mood of the game. Music part is legendary too! I really like most of the tracks, so this one is really on it for me!

About the gameplay, it's challanging and fun. You have RPG elements in the game, which is the XP system, leveling up your character for Strength, Magic, Defense and Agility stats, finding new weapons with different attributes, searching for new pets with different abilites, collecting gold and buy items from the shop, meanwhile you using different fighting methods, combos and weapons in order to beat the enemies. The game is really testing you, because fights can be difficult, but this is the healthy challange the game can offer you. Enemies are different, requires different tactics too and they could make your job difficult, and the same goes to the bosses. You doing an advanture and for this, the game gives you a world which you go into more and more, level to level, see new territories and places, which gives really varied maps and themes, not even mentioning the fun elements of the game. It's really good, however I need to nitpick about the last boss fight, which felt too long and that was not fun at all. Also, some places has a bigger difficulty peak, but bearable. What is really important to mention, the game is only fun with friends, so if you want to get this game, get it with others. 4 players can play at the same time, but Remote Play works fine with this one. So, gameplay is really fun and challanging, not too difficult and has lot of content gameplay wise.

About the story... is not really focused on and not really mentionable. You do what you need to do, chasing down bosses and the mage, but there is no dialogue, no deep motives, it's just a simple fairy tale. This would make me bit dissapointed, but in this case, comparing how the game it looks, I really don't care about it, and I'm fine with it.

Castle Crashers probably the most fun coop beat'em up you can get on Steam, which supports 4 players. The game time is also really good, not boring and not too hard either. The game don't have game braking bugs or horrible graphics, the whole product feels untouchable really. I can definetly recommend to play the game, for 12€ it was completly worth it for me."
8166,"Hey look, I'm in a game!"
8167,"this is an amazing game, really fun, even better with friends! its got an incredible combo system but the story isnt really that complicated, it pretty much boils down to guy kidnaps princess you rescue princess and kill people. Main gripe is that most characters are reskins and then (about final boss) [spoiler]the final boss has 5 phases, most of which are extremely boring and its quite an anti-climactic boss[/spoiler].
Otherwise its an amazing funny game"

Also music is good, its simple and good but for me the necromancer theme is the best song in this game. I give this game 9/10 only because of short story (i know there is insane mode) but everything else is very good. I can easily recommend this game to other players!"

Reminiscent (actually, almost exactly alike in many core features) of an old school coop side scrolling ARPG (can't remember the name of that game... It's been almost 20 years). Highly recommended."
8180,"This game saved my life.

I am 33.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
8181,Very fun with friends!
8182,is good
8183,"As playing 63.3 hours on record i cant recommend this game enough the soundtrack is fun you can play with your friends with over 31 characters and many unique levels, and its really fun to play with your friends you can have up to 4 players or play alone if you like. But to tell if you want to play the game just try the demo first."

8259,"I love this game, my girlfriend and I have spent days replaying it trying to unlock characters and get achievements. I love when a game is fun by yourself, it's even more fun with other people but if you don't have anyone to play with it's still very enjoyable.

P.S. F*ck corn boss, all my homies hate corn boss."
8260,"I absolutely love Castle Crashers. It was one of the first games I ever played and I haven't set it down since. It's quirky and funny; the story even being told without words is captivating and has fantastic replay ability. It's a fantastic game to play by yourself and even more fun with a party. I can't recommend a game more.

A list of things I like about it:
-Enjoyable solo
-Fun to try and level up
-Well Paced
-Awesome as a group
-Unlockable Characters
-Characters level individually
-Different magic abilities
-Cute design"

8326,"Well, after many years have passed of the end of my good old PS3 days one of the games I've missed most was Castle Crashers. There is a reason this games overall review percent is insanely high, one of the greatest titles ever. Absolutely amazing game with friends aswell! If you don't have any there is a somewhat active online multiplayer option :D"
8327,"fun alone, but way more fun with friends, i'd recommend having at least one other player with you while playing, still an amazing game"

---------------------------------
Castle Crashers is an essential game. The visuals are absolutely beautiful, every facet of the game oozes an irreplacable charm, the music is phenomenal throughout. It's an amazing arcade-style Beat 'em up that anyone can jump in and play. In fact, Castle Crashers is the first game I owned on Steam when I was a wee bab in Fall 2012. I highly recommend this game to anyone. 
---------------------------------
GAMEPLAY - ★★★★★ (Simple, but upgradeable stats make every character feel distinct.)
GRAPHICS - ★★★★★ (The well-rounded and cartoonish charm of Dan Paladin's art makes this game look stellar.)
EXTRA CONTENT - ★★★★★ (50+ characters, plenty of weapons and animal orbs to collect.)
LONGEVITY - ★★★★★ (A long main campaign + another difficulty and extra content mentioned above make this game eternally replayable.)
OVERALL - ★★★★★"
8348,Good :)

8352,Castle Crashers is one of those games you can hop on to and have a great couple hours of fun with some friends. Highly recommend.
8353,good game
8354,"i think it's one of the best 2d games ever made it can be played solo to four people at once my favorite part is that castle crashers tryes to make fun of it self abd makes it more fun 


i would recomed it if you have a friend or more but if not try to find one becuse it makes the experience more fun"
8355,REally easy to pick up and play with others. A lot of fun.
8356,"is good (0Oo_oO0)
"
8357,i played it on the ps3 xbox 1 and now pc. good game.
8358,Good co-op game '_'
8359,Back Crackers is the best beat em up game I've ever played. 10/10 Shit deer funne
8360,"So picture this. You're 11 year old me and your older brother gets an xbox 360. One of the first couple of games on the arcade was Castle Crashers, but since you(me) was 11, money was tight. So you replayed the demo over and over until finally, big brother man buys the game and you jump in and beat the game over and over over until you've unlocked all the characters and weapons and all the cute little animal orbs. 
Now you may be asking what this has to do with it being a good game. Well strap in and get ready to crash some castles; in a metaphorical sense.

Castle Crashers is a 4 player co-op beat-em-up adventure where you get the option to play between 4 knights. As you progress through the story it has a lot of childish humor that makes me laugh even today. (I mean it just looks like newgrounds from the art style alone) What makes this sort of different from the others, is that you can level up and place experience points into 4 different stats. Offence, defense, magic, and agility. These stats can effect your gameplay and even increase your combo game. 

The story is pretty basic, an evil wizard invades the town after partying with the boys and captures 4 princesses. You must do everything you can to get them back. So nothing too crazy but I've always enjoyed it regardless. 

Gameplay is super fun with friends and still decent alone. The more friends you have, the more chaotic the screen gets when you're all bashin' n' crashin'. It's also relatively short, like 2 hours and you can finish it pretty easily. But afterwords you can unlock a harder difficulty and some other content.

Only downside is that there used to be a mini game called All You Can Quaff, where you just button mash to eat food. It got replaced with another game called Back-off Barbarian which is still fun but I feel it just isn't as intense as Quaffing against your friends.

Whatever, still a fun game :)))    8/10
"
8361,"Classic game that brings back a ton of memories! Runs well! No issues with the content in game. I recommend to people who've debated buying this game, and for ones who just wanna get back into this nostalgic game!"
8362,Game is kinda poop. I put a decent amount of time into the game and still cant get past the first boss. Even dark souls was easier.

8416,So fucking good i hate that i love it so much
8417,pretty fun except for when a stinky nerd used lightning magic on me every single time we would do a boss fight and were fighting for the princess.
8418,if you leave a dislike on this game you're probably one of the barbarians that die in the start of the game
8419,knight go kill
8420,"Do you like?
Brutally slaughtering your friends to get a kiss?
Making people explode?
Poop jokes?
General hilarity?
Sandwiches that not only taste great, but also are packed with steriods?
If you answered yes to any of these questions then this game is for you

In short castle crashers is a medieval hack and slash adventure which you can play by yourself or with up to 3 friends (Four player Co-op). It possesses an amazing cast of unlockable characters, enough stupid moments to last a decade, and cartoony graphics which will never get old.
Have Fun!

8465,"One of my favorite games, have bought on every console and pc ive owned and its tradition to play all the way through every now and then. Beautifal colors and subtle but hilarious funny moments throughout. Combat is perfect as well. Felt like a polished game even when it was new."

8470,"The game of my childhood, I can't even say, how happy I was to grab it on steam for soooo cheap and feel that nostalgy. I had many good memories with that game, but the one that got hold of my mind, is the one when I've met a random kid in public lobby, we came to the blacksmith, and he started dropping weapons, so I could add all of them to my collection, everytime that guy dropped me a weapon, we spammed shield for like 4 minutes straight for no reason, it was dumb, but oh boy, I couldn't be happier back then."

8482,"It's a very nice game and very addictive 
"
8483,"This game is a short story tbh. But even if it is short, it is fun to play by yourself or with your friends. This game has a good plot in it with stupid jokes that makes people laugh. Is castle crasher worth to play? after spending hours on this game and finishing the game for the 10th time........ totally worth it!"

8498,"this is a great game. its very short and there is no way to delete a save file without deleting all of your save data, but the gameplay makes up for it. it is much more fun with friends, and much easier, but single player is still fun on its own. I got this game on sale for 3 USD per copy (bought 3 copies, one for me, and 2 for my friends). its humor is funny, but it is still very early humor due to the release date of this game. fun fact, the lead programmer also made newgrounds!"

8517,"Fairly fun co-op game, but it needs a little more polish. Many of the characters are terrible, and with the xp per hit, some characters gain xp very quickly leaving others in the dust. You can't see what items you already have when in a shop, which either means you waste your cash, or you have to waste lots of time running around to check."
8518,10/10 game would reccomend everyone to play it
8519,"Good game but the price is too high i think for this 2D game but when you wait for sale just bought :DDD
"
8520,get it its so worht it
8521,"This game is one of those games that everyone ought to play at least once. I had originally owned it on the xbox 360 where it was first released, and decided to repurchase it to see if it still holds up after 14 years. Turns out it does. 

What I like:
-Beautiful art-style with lots of vibrant colors and unique characters.
-Combat is simple and enjoyable.
-The story is a cliche ""save the princess"" type of order but there is a lot of fun and unique way that the game decides to tell the story. 
-Level design really feels fluid and mechanics learned in the levels help to better navigate the boss fights
-Its a very enjoyable game to sit down with a handful of friends and hack and slash away at enemies
-Fighting for the princess' kiss in multiplayer is very fun
What I don't like:
-The ""Lava World"" level kind of drags on (no pun intended) and probably would have been better split into two levels, the same goes for some of the late-game levels before the final boss
-The amount of time required to grind all the way to level 99 is rather crazy, also kind of confused because you only need to hit level 78 to max out your stats. Would be nice to see some kind of reward for hitting level 99 on a character."
8522,yes
8523,"It feels insane that this game is nearly 9 years old but that's how it is. I played this game first when I was around 10 years old, and I remember having a blast with friends. 

The game has aged. And not all in good ways. The gameplay is still surprisingly good. You juggle enemies Devil May Cry style and jump around the battlefield hacking and slashing. It plays quite well with friends, and if you've got a couple who can join you, you can certainly spend hours working your way through the campaign.

The humor, however, has aged like milk. Poop humor, sexism, and an abundance of gore for the sake of it makes pretty much every joke in this game fall flat if you're older than 13. So don't expect to be laughing at the game. Instead you'll be laughing along with your friends!

And there lies the best aspect of Castle Crashers. It's great with friends. So if you have friends to play with, you'll have fun."
8524,"When I first saw this game I didn't think it would be as good as it is, it combines getting new levels and weapons with a nice action packed game, as you play, you can unlock more knights which have different magic so you can experiment with different knights to see which one you like best. Overall a great game and would definitely recommend it."
8525,very big boom boom
8526,This game is nice
8527,me and my friends sat sown to play this game we beat the game with every character in only 7238hrs not worth the 3 dollars i spent on it while it was on sale.
8528,yeah its pretty good
8529,"Brings back so many memories. 

its like a campaign but also you can grind it.

its the shit, yo"
8530,This Game Still To This Day Is One Of The Best I Have Ever Played! It Earned A Special Place In My Heart I Admit Since I Didn't Have The Money When The Game Release Yes I Know Dirty Pirate But Ever Since I Saw It Here I Bought It To Show Support To This Game It May Be Old But That Doesn't Mean It Is Dead This Game Is Best Experienced With A Friend Or Friends But You Can Have Fun Playing Solo Too! The 2 Dlc Are Absolutely Worth It This Game Will Always Make Me Sweat When Battling For The Princess The Soundtrack Is 10/10 Beautiful Id Say It Is Worth The Full Price It Was A Part Of My Childhood And Of Many Other People's Childhoods May This Game Still Be Loved And The Community Never Fall LONG LIVE CASTLE CRASHERS!!!!!!!

8554,This game is great. This game makes me soo happy.  If you dont own this game your a square.
8555,"This will get you laid instantly. I played league of legends for 15 long years, nothing. Fire up this bad boy with friends then bam hot girls in my area come running to my door. Could be a certain vibration that gets women in a 10 mile radius fired up but damn i'm not complaing"
8556,best game ever
8557,"Ive played this game on Xbox One since the 360. I just bought it on steam since there was a sale.

Right as I opened the game, all the nostalgia came back. I love the art style, music, and combat in this game. I personally find this game very addicting since there are 31 characters to unlock and play as. There are also many weapons to find, and pets that give your character a special benefits that only come with that pet.

If you are thinking about buying this game when/while its on sale, I would go for it. Its super fun to play with friends, and the game keeps you going even after you finish the story mode. This was my childhood game, and I am still playing it to this day."
8558,"Yes, just yes. dont question just get.

"
8671,"mash buttons, kill goons while collecting weapons and pets! Many ""all nighters"" with the gang playing this."
8672," Now I Beat this game several years ago on the Xbox 360 multiple times and all I can say is that it still holds up. of course the game isn't that old but its scary to say that this game came out in 2008 which is 13 years ago might I add. The game play holds up, the art and style of the game still holds up, the music 100% holds up and has a crazy memorable soundtrack, the bosses are as original as they come, and the game doesn't need a crazy gaming pc to run! I should have picked this game up sooner but now with it being on sale I 100% without a doubt recommend this game to all ages. Once you beat this game a few times over you should also go check out some of the behemoths other titles, all with their own personality and unique humor. This game is overall a great time and loads of fun to play with friends too! and with that have fun slashing through your enemies and getting the baddies! (I do recommend a controller though)"
8673,Timeless arcade adventure game that can be revisited often for a rewarding and fun experience.
8674,"I used to play this game on Xbox 360 and, replaying it now, it's just as fun as I remember. The humor in this game is really nostalgic and the gameplay is still incredibly fun, especially with friends."
8675,i can play with my friends and with memories i played the old version as a kid on xbox 360
8676,too many people dont know what this game is now. we must teach the younger generations.
8677,funy gam wen i see dere poo i laf  cuz poop funy
8678,2013 was the best year of my life
8679,"It's a great game, which is why it's a classic. I remember playing this for hours and hours on the Xbox 360 trying to unlock everything. It's a great, silly, coop game. It might not always make the rotation, but I always make a point of coming back and playing a few levels every once and a while."

8706,"I played this game for hundreds of hours on xbox 360 years ago and had a few level 99s before. I got the itch to play again and me and a friend 100% completed it together on pc as well. I had a few doubts initially thinking it wouldn't hold up to the memory I had of it, BUT it was still absolutely awesome and I loved it! I find Behemoth to be great developers and am also a fan of their newer games pit people and battleblock theatre. Here comes the classic list of pros and cons:

[u] Pros [/u]
++ Fluid and satisfying gameplay
++ SOO many characters, pets and weapons to unlock
++ A classic button mashing arcade style game 
+ Fun, colourful graphics
+ Great game to play with friends

[u] Cons [/u]
-Multiplayer can be laggy at times and has a low playerbase nowadays
-Definitely need a controller to play comfortably (In my opinion, maybe not in others)

TL;DR: An awesome game with a lot of content and a cheap price tag!"

Life is good.  That's how I feel whenever I play this game.  A trip back to my childhood where bathroom humor and dopey characters are everything needed to create some of the fondest memories of one's life.  It's main play time comes from the replayability through the tens of characters you unlock as well as the postgame hard mode.  Castle Crashers will forever hold a dear place in my cold-dead heart, and I hope it will in your's too.  9/10"

I recommend this game to anyone who just loves to kill stuff or likes princess secks"

8740,"Castle crashers is the best in artistic skills and bringing cartoonish designs and joke into video games in a very entertaining way. The game always has a main objective of fighting the dark wizard and kiss the princesses which never leaves you thinking ""what am i doing?"" and ""where am i going"" but makes you say ""god damn i want that dragon pet and the lightsaber"". It's hard to believe that this game came from newgrounds and not a disney game."

8750,great game i personally loved playing this game and going through all the fights again (i had already beaten this on switch) most of my friends dont really like this game at all because of the humor and just how the gameplay was but i didnt really mind the humor and i thought the gameplay was pretty cool i think its better near end game because of the intensity of the bosses and levels but yea this is my review.

8775,the game is good but there is no replay value and theres very little content
8776,"Good old childhood memories.

Easily the best game Behemoth has ever made. ( Not saying their other games aren't good, just nothing competes with this majestic piece of nostalgia)"
8777,better than minecraft
8778,"With this being my childhood game on the Xbox 360, I have a lot to say about this game. For this game has many memories and a lot of fun things that The Behemoth has done for video games. 

Castle Crashers began as a huge game. (Okay not really. But it evolved huge later) Arguably one of my favorite indie games of all time. I used to play this game over and over and over. This game was huge to people at the time and a lot of people I knew loved The Behemoth because of this. 

For anyone new to The Behemoth games, this should be the first game you play. There is Alien Hominid HD, Battleblock Theater, and all of these other titles that they made. But Castle Crashers really had the experience and all the things that started me off with a Behemoth game. I recommend this to anyone who bought Castle Crashers or in fact new to the series. HOWEVER, be in mind that this game is very old. I don't even know if there is actual players still playing this game and still enjoying it. Though, players can still play single player to get that juggling, magic, skull ripper experience from Castle Crashers. 

If you have friends who play this game, it would make the experience more fun most times. Not to mention the two extra game modes: Back off Barbarian and The Arena. 

For anyone new, enjoy the game and have the best of it.

"
8779,"This is definitely one of my favorite games ever. There are so many different characters to unlock and each one has their own unique abilities. Also, the story line is so well put together and never gets old no matter how many times you play it. I highly recommend playing this game!!!"

8810,"Annoying that you can't skip in-game cinematics.
Some enemies are REALLY annoying (*cough cough* arrow-spamming thieves *cough cough*)
And creators of it seem to have a poop fetish -_-


But do I recommend it? Well hell yea! It's an old classic. If you're into screen-scroller beat-them-ups, go for it, especially if you have a couple friends to play with.

Did I mentioned that you can Emperror Palpatine force-lighting enemies to death? Because you can! (as the Red Knight) POWER! UNLIMITEEED POWEEEER!"

"
8816,"Castle Crashers is a button masher 2D game, where your goal on the main mode is to defeat the final boss, and can be played multiplayer, single player, or local multiplayer. The story on the main mode is fun and can be long your first time playing. There are 4 classes you can level up as you play along and level up your character, you can go with melee, being a tank, magic, or archery and speed. There are also 2 difficulty modes on the main mode, normal, and insane mode, which unlocks for each character after you beat normal mode with that character, and is much much harder than normal mode. There are also two other modes to play, PvP and another one where you run from the bad guys using 4 buttons to move 4 directions. In the PvP mode you can play with friends online, in a private game, or on split screen, or on your own against other people world wide. The other mode can also be played with friends, but if one person dies, you have to collect a healing potion that spawns randomly before the time runs out. The game offers many different mechanics as you play through, and tons of different pets and weapons, each with different abilities and bonuses. Overall this game is very fun, and can be addictive! I have played this game for hours on Xbox and would 10/10 recommend this game if you haven't played it before!"

8860,"Great game if playing single player. Co-op it's total cancer. It lag skips like mad when you play and puts you off playing with anyone but yourself. Feels like a port and a lazy cash grab to me. Maybe buy it on console instead if you still have one, it worked well on xbox."

8873,"Probably one of the best games ive ever played i highly recommend you buy this it has no flaws at all except maybe that the story isnt longer lol, i would say a normal play through is around 3 hours but there is soooo much replayability definitely worth the price and extremly worth it whenever its on sale."
8874,"Very fun like the game is just so pro.
"
8875,this is acutally the werst gmae i ve every played
8876,"FUN. COOL. SILLY.
This game is old, but it's one of the silliest and most enjoyable co-op games I've ever played. To be fair, I'm bias from my thousands of hours I played when I was a kid but I came back to it during COVID and I still love it. It's the perfect mix of badassery and complete dorkyness that is perfect for my sense of entertainment. You go from raiding a steampunk Castle to fighting a sentient volcano and other things, to punching terminator zombies into the ground, to being abducted to Alien Hominids! I would really only recommend it to play with friends but it's fine to play alone as well."

9047,This game is 100% more enjoyable with friends and I dare say don't play it without any. It can feel grindy at times and some enemies are sponges but even when it gets the grindiest the game may take 4hrs max to beat. Considering the price I think it's perfect for what it is and doesn't try to be anything more than that.

9095,It’s a good game and I would say it nearly perfect being cartoony and funny. One drawback though and that is because you can’t fully beat the game for free. (I mean you can’t unlock all of the characters and you technically can beat the game)

9101,Best game ever made
9102,Completed a few times on the PS3. Awesome game with great humor and lots of weapons and collectibles.
9103,good meme
9104,i like men
9105,This game is very simple and easy to learn. I played this game with my young kids and they had tons of fun. highly recommended !!
9106,"It's a cool classic game, a must have in each and every Steam user's library."
9107,very bad very very bery bad
9108,fun
9109,"Even after 12-13 years of this game being released, it's still a classic in my books, just as enjoyable as the first time I played it all those years ago. I bought it off of nostalgia when it went on sale, but honestly they deserve the full price they charge for this game for how amazing it is. 10/10."
9110,knights go brrr
9111,Its good innit
9112,"this game is good with friends,but sadly i don't have any"
9113,"I wish we had Castle Crashers 2, I remember how much I enjoyed this game and met a lot of nice people between 2010 - 2013 on Xbox 360

Good Times :)"
9114,"I'll tell you one thing, I put a little bit of liquor in my beer and uh -- play this game with my friends."
9115,"good fun, pretty fun. definitely more fun with friends. i recommend a controller"
9116,"It's boring when you play alone. 



Get some friends to play this game"
9117,The funnest game I've ever played this game reminds me of stuff I'd be able to play on the school computers before the teacher noticed. Overall I highly recommend this game. Fun for all ages and genders. Btw the music in this game is AMAZING.
9118,This is by far one of my favorite games
9119,"I have beaten this game twice, with different people in co-op.
I would highly, highly recommend this game as co-op, it's a ton of fun, has some replayability via the RPG elements.
Has a good additional goal of ""catching them all"" for tiny animals.
It sucks a bit that there are too many builds that are not very viable in the game, but overall it's pretty good."
9120,me like to distroy castle
9121,"This game is an absolute classic. I played it on Xbox the first time through but enjoyed it so much that I got it on Steam to do yet another playthrough. The gameplay is simple yet engaging, and the story is downright stupid (but in a good way). The characters and locations are memorable. There are even collectibles in the forms of the animal orbs that can encourage more playtime in order to find them all. However, the best part of this entire game, by far, is that it has 4 player co-op! What better way to wrap up all the best features than with the best of them all. My friends and I have had so much fun playing through the story mode and then going on to the various mini games available as well. Castle Crashers really is a wonderful game that will build memories for you and your friends with every encounter."
9122,Iv'e crashed some castles this is what I felt like. WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE die stupid guy with bag on head.
9123,Great game.
9124,very good
9125,It's a classic
9126,"i ddont know what to say, i love this game soo much
"
9127,A blast from the past. Great playing with friends.
9128,"Fun little beat'em-up game. Worth it if it's on massive sale. Fun to play couch co-op or online co-op. About 6 hours of gameplay in here at least. Much more if you want to play and level up more characters but there isn't much reason to.

Hitboxes can be very jank. The art and humor is great."
9129,Absolute gem

I would highly reccomend this masterpiece if you like classic old games from the 2010s, and if you like 2D games with combat"
9170,"i fucking LOVE castle crashers. rq 5 reasons you should get castle crashers
1. large array of characters adding replay value
2. large amount of weapons and pets making you want to find out good combos
3. monkey pet OOOHOHOAAHAHAHAOOHAH
4. good story aspects making it fun to replay and fight bosses
5. the combat in this game is GLORIOUS

now one reason the game can be ruined
1. insane mode

9173,"The gameplay is pretty meh, the fights are overwelming, and it promotes SOO much selfish play where if you are playing with other people there is a huge chance you will get NOTHING since everyone else is getting all the crap, its also packed full of inmature jokes. So if you hate your friends and like dumb jokes heres a great game for you."
9174,"This. game. Is. Awesome. I bought it a few years ago but never got to actually play that much of it. When I came back to it a couple of weeks ago... Oh boy... I couldn't stop playing. I invited friends to play with me so many times. The game is perfect for both Co-op and Single Player, and that's fantastic. haven't enjoyed a game like this one in a while. Make sure to bring some friends along when you play this work of art."

9181,I love this game its so fun but challenging at some points. I would recommend playing with 3 or 4 friends/randoms because its a lot easier to get through the game.
9182,"Noice

9183,"NOICE game. But I just want to unlock the Necromancer and I HATE insane mode, and I don't have friends to play this game with."
9184,It's a good game because it has so much fun to play with friends but it's kinda small.
9185,"Cool game, really cool game. Another one I found out on Newgrounds many years ago and only could play now. After awhile, my hand starts to hurt due to uncountable repetitive movements, mostly on arena, but the game is still awesome. Really a pity multiplayer is mostly dead now, though. It's about time for Tom Fulp to release a sequel, especially now they are bringing Alien Hominid back.

Jogo legal, jogo realmente legal. Mais um que descobri no Newgrounds muitos anos atrás e só hoje pude jogar. Depois de um tempo, minha mão começa a doer devido a incontáveis movimentos repetitivos, sobretudo na arena, mas o jogo é fantástico. Uma pena que o multijogador está bem morto hoje, no entanto. Já é hora de Tom Fulp lançar uma sequência, especialmente agora que estão trazendo o Alien Hominid de volta.

9227,"Dude. This game is literally my childhood and its so damn fun, Its like a beat em up but its with awesome knights with magic, there is literally a deer that shits so hard that it flies using its mere massive amount of brown anus power. This is so fun, this is like my favorite side scroller beat em up (cause its the only one ive played) (also juggling is super damn fun) I would say its a must buy my homies."
9228,"A Fun, Indie Singleplayer and Multiplayer Game For Anyone Looking For A Laid Back RPG.
Would highly suggest for anyone to buy it during a sale.



Pros:
Laid Back RPG
Local Co-op, Online Co-op
Family Friendly (Cartoon Violence, Blood Hit Indicator)
3 Gamemodes (Main Story PvE, Arena PvP [If Singleplayer PvE], Back Off Barbarian, PvE)



Cons:
Lack of bug fixes
No crossplay (PC and Mac can play together, if any confusion on the ""Cross Platform Multiplayer"")
Grindy game
Repetitive levels
Dead community (Nobody plays Co-op Public Online)



Still, would highly suggest for anyone to play as a couch party, online with friends or to play by yourself!"
9229,Want a more in depth 2D Arcade Beat em' up? Then this is perfect for you.
9230,7/10 The hit boxen kinda suck in this game! It´s a shame because it takes a lot of fun out of the game. Otherwise it´s a color full and fun experience.
9231,"Oh where to start. (I know I only had 15 hours played when I wrote this review. I have over 250 hours on a different account) Hey! Wait! Don't leave yet! this review won't be that long. About The Game: Castle Crashers is by far one of the greatest beat 'em ups ever made. (if not the best) You get to start off by playing as one of the four starter knights, Red Knight, Orange knight, Blue Knight, and Green Knight. To beat the campaign you need to fight through waves of enemy knights and monsters to get to the bosses. The campaign isn't that long, but it offers lots of replayability, as there are many different characters you can earn by beating the campaign with different knights. each knight has their own special magic ability and starter weapon. The Story: The story of Castle Crashers isn't the best story ever, but its still good, and what it lacks in story it makes up for in artistic style. A summary of the story: (I won't spoil any of the story that you find out late in game) An evil wizard takes the king's crystal and a bunch of princesses. Your job is to get the crystal and save the princesses from a number of bosses. There are also two mini games, Arena mode, and Back Off Barbarian. And Lastly The Price: I think 15$ is a great price for this game. But if you have patience, you can wait until it gets a good sale, and buy it for 5$. if you don't buy this game for as cheap as 5$ I don't think you will ever buy it. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! I LIED, THIS WAS A VERY LONG REVIEW AND I TRICKED YOU INTO READING IT!!! >:D"

9267,This is one of the best games i have ever played.
9268,this game has no reason to go as hard as it does.
9269,"For the last two years, I would play the ""Knight's Game"", as my son would call it, with him on my lap right before bedtime. He would just watch and tell me which character to pick, where to go, what animal friend to bring - and this would be a video game version of groundhog day for me which has driven me to the edge of insanity.

However, just a few days ago, instead of simply watching me play he joined me with his own controller. Father and son, fighting side by side. I was teaching him what to do and he held his own (well, more like as a decoy for me mostly but still). 

The point is, yeah I may not have liked this game and I did feel it was repetitive, clunky, juvenile, and one I would rate as a ""not recommend"" but its simplicity makes for good bonding time with kids and is one title that is part of our family story now."

9280,"The overall story may be short, but with all of the different characters offering different experiences, this game is amazingly fun and a good time with friends"
9281,"One of the best games on Steam to play with friends. It's a lot of fun, each character has different magical moves. It's pretty funny and ridiculous at times, has great music, really recommend it for groups of friends just willing to chill out, unless you're trying the insane mode, then it's not so much fun."

I've been looking forward to this game for a long time, and I was not disappointed.

The story is very funny, and the characters are all very likable.

I really enjoyed the humor, and the game is very easy to play.

I'm sure that it's not for everyone, but I really enjoyed it.

It's a very fun game, and I would recommend it to"

9388,"Divine Protection of Wind Indication
The Divine Protection of Wind Indication (風見の加護 Kazami no Kago) is used by Crusch Karsten. It enables her to read the wind and to see invisible things just like the wind. Crusch can also use it to read the situation of others' emotions, making her able to tell if someone has lied.

Divine Protection of Wind Evasion
The Divine Protection of Wind Evasion (風避けの加護 Kazeyoke no Kago) is used by Earth Dragons such as Patrasche. It enables them to be unaffected by the wind and not encounter any wind resistance while running. The effect also applies to the Dragon Carriage that they pull. After activation, there is a cool down period before the user can use it again.

Divine Protection of Soul Language
The Divine Protection of Soul Language (言霊の加護 Kotodama no Kago) is used by Otto Suwen. It enables the user to talk with all sorts of living creatures, however the user speaks in the language of the creature they're talking with, making the user look shady to others. As Otto can't use it properly, he normally keeps it plugged. Continuous use of this Divine Protection can cause the user to cough blood. It's also worth noting that the vast majority of people who're blessed with this Divine Protection ended up going mad and committing suicide, due to the non-stop barrage of noises which are impossible to cancel. Otto Suwen is only the second person in history who managed to tame and control it.

Divine Protection of the Death God
The Divine Protection of the Death God (死神の加護 Shinigami no Kago, ""Divine Protection of the Death God"") was formerly used by Theresia van Astrea. Slashes imbued with the Divine Protection's power leave wounds that are unable to be healed. The power of the Divine Protection increases the closer they are to the target, and the user can even reopen wounds others have if they are close enough and were originally inflicted by them. If the wound expands so does the effect of the protection, if the wound was a light cut on the finger and the target cut off said finger this new wound becomes the target of the protection. The effects disappear if the user dies.

The Divine Protection of Magic Manipulation (魔操の加護 Masou no Kago) is used by Meili Portroute. It allows the user to control hornless Demon Beasts, making the user a Demon Beast User (魔獣使い Majuu Tsukai). Normally, hornless Demon Beasts are killed by others, but due to the divine protection, the user apparently functions as the horn. The user is unable to control powerful Demon Beast such as the Hakugei and can be incompatible with certain others, such as the Oiranguma, though the user can still control them.

Divine Protection of Telepathy
The Divine Protection of Telepathy (伝心の加護 Denshin no Kago) is used by Reinhard van Astrea and Liliana Masquerade. It enables the user to tell other people their thoughts telepathically. While it's normally used to tell close friends certain thoughts, it can be combined with singing to increase the strength and effect range.

Divine Protection of Arrow Evasion
The Divine Protection of Arrow Evasion (矢避けの加護 Yayoke no Kago) is used by Reinhard van Astrea. It makes thrown weapons such as knives change their trajectory, effectively making it impossible for them to hit the user.

But if the user is unable to physically avoid or counter the attack, the Divine Protection will not activate.

The Divine Protection of Second Sight (再臨の加護 Sairin no Kago) is used by Reinhard van Astrea. It enables the user to respond to an attacks that they experience twice or more with a vastly greater speed and reflexes, making it practically impossible to land a hit on the user.

Divine Protection of Phoenix
The Divine Protection of Phoenix (不死鳥の加護 Fushichō no Kago) was used by Reinhard van Astrea. It enables the user to come back to life immediately only once if they die. He lost it when he was revived against Regulus.Upon death, he is granted a ""continue?"" once.  He has already used this blessing in his fight with Regulus. While he can't receive the same benefit endlessly, after he used the blessing, he will acquire ""Next Blessing of the Phoenix"", and then ""Next Next Blessing of the Phoenix and so on endlessly, as Od laguna won't let him die.

Divine Protection of Phoenix - Next
The Divine Protection of Phoenix - Next is used by Reinhard van Astrea. It enables the user to come back to life immediately only once if they die.

Divine Protection of Trisection
The Divine Protection of Trisection (三分の加護 Sanbun no Kago) is used by Mimi Pearlbaton, Hetaro Pearlbaton, and Tivey Pearlbaton. It enables the users to bear themselves or each other's physical and emotional burdens and can also be used to split damage between all users such as to block death blows. However, if they were to use it on themselves, they would have to bear a heavy burden on their body. As Mimi is the strongest out of the three of her brothers, they are often stuck with bearing her burdens. In addition, Tivey can launch a destructive interference wave using the Divine Protection and his siblings, though Mimi is limited to five times and Hetaro and Tivey are limited to two times respectively, so the maximum usage per day is four times."

9391,"Castle Crashers is unfortunately rather boring. I would say it is a great game for kids, but not for people above 16 years.

The cartoony art style is fine and kind of cute. The soundtrack itself is nice too.

But the gameplay… wow… so lame. All you do is spam your attacks. Yes, you can do combos, jump, shoot arrows etc. But you basically just spam attacks. The bosses are too easy and the whole game didn’t entertain me very much.

I played this with a friend, and we were both disappointed."
9392,"A simple and fun game to play with friends. I mostly played with roommates years ago on xbox but picked up a copy for the lady and I. It's not something we play a lot of, a 30 minute session here and there but it is a good time. You have your base character knights and can unlock new characters by beating the game with each knight. The abilities of the characters definitely range from lackluster to omg I murgle everything so thats kind of a bummer but doesn't detract from the enjoyment. It's good, silly fun for couch co op, I'd recommend it."

9401,I feast on the blood of the weak
9402,"Nice, simple, fast, entertaining. Despite having tons of characters to unlock through completing the game with other characters, wouldn't say it has that much of replay value. Its a safe bet if you want to grab the controllers and play a run with some friends once in a while."

9431,"I love this game so much idk why i didn't bought it when it first came. I played all the flash games that this company made and had alot of fun. Im so sad that i didn't bought it sooner. The game cost regularly like 15$ and it worth the money. I bought at a discount but i think i will donate more some how because this game is so epic and fun. Time passes fast when you play it. The colours and humour are perfect. Its not a repetitive game, there's always something new to discover. 10/10"

9433,"nice

9434,Hmm turtles
9435,"Pretty annoying brawler lacking balance for single player, as enemies start having insane amounts of health in the late game. Might be alright if you have other people to play with, but alone? Skip this. There are certainly better brawlers which do not remind us of the time flash games were a thing."
9436,This game has NO bluetooth support something the devs knows about and dont care. What a pathetic thing to not fix. Would not recommend on this alone. How lazy.

9460,NEWGROUNDS CLASSIC

9463,"I really recommend this game. Its so funny and wild. It's definitely fun to play. Just a bit laggy trying to play with other people. But that other person, was my brother so that might be why. Also wifi sucks, so the point is, its an AMAZING game."
9464,"Castle Crashers se basa en 4 caballeros con poderes elementales que intentan perseguir a un Hechicero Malvado después de que éste se lleve el ""Gran Cristal"" y secuestre a las princesas del palacio. Cada una han sido cautivas por diferentes jefes, los que nos lleva a nosotros como jugadores ponernos en los pies de los diferentes caballeros, ya sea que juegues solo o con amigos habrá 5 jugadores desbloqueados. 

- Un caballero verde el cual tiene poder de controlar el elemento veneno. 
- Caballero rojo que controla el elemento trueno.
- Caballero Azul controla el elemento hielo.
- Caballero Naranja que controla el elemento fuego.

La calidad gráfica le da un toque humorístico y encaja perfectamente con el juego, las texturas están bien hechas, los personajes están diseñados de manera única y diferente, que puede ayudar a ser recordados. El humor es bueno; te puede sacar algunas risas.

Los efectos de sonidos son hermosos; cuando ejecutas el golpe fuerte si se siente la potencia con cual le das a los enemigos.

El juego como tal tiene toques de RPG (subir de nivel, magias, enemigos, niveles, etc...), los controles se sienten toscos, la distancia entre los enemigos y tú es difícil de saber porque habrá varios escenarios en el que pensarás que estas cara a cara del jefe/enemigo, pero en realidad estas detrás o abajo de él. El juego es entretenido y divertido, más si lo juegas con amigos a pesar de los errores antes mencionados, los mapas y enemigos no son repetitivos, lo que se agradece mucho.

Puntuación final : 8

9465,wack bad guys
9466,"All in all, a very engaging experience with multiple people. Solo is quite hard but very rewarding with how quickly you gain xp. You should really check this game out for some for some laughs, engaging gameplay and an overall fun time!"

but whenever i die at a bossfight i shouldn't have to fight the enemies i've already fought 6 times before just to get to the boss

please spawn us back at the fucking boss point, not the beginning of the level"
9471,its the best game ever the fighting is great and the bosses heck ya
9472,"Honestly a really fun game it has a good story line and it really lets the player do whatever they want weather that be to grind until max level, collect every item and character or just to play it all the way through on every character. it has simplistic graphics which lets bad pc's run it. a really good game i would tell friends to get it if i had any."
9473,"This is my childhood i love this game! I used to play it on my ps3 now i can finally play it on pc!

9480,a classic collin blunder
9481,"If you're playing by yourself, it's pretty challenging. But with friends (on Remote Play) it's loads of fun, and the campaign is action-packed & exciting. Only thing is that after you beat the last boss there isn't a whole lot to do, and available DLC only unlocks characters."
9482,Reminds me of my childhood
9483,good
9484,Amazing game

9578,"This game is like if a bunch of NewGrounds artists got together and all decided to collectively make a game and it's amazing. There's so many visual gags that I missed my first time through. Even at the beginning when the knight crashes down the steps and then does that flashing de-spawning thing that happens in so many games. I didn't even realize the purple princess's face was always covered until like halfway through the game. Speaking of which, they really said screw our epileptic audience at the end lol.

Anyways, gameplay wise this game skirts the perfect line between difficulty and enjoyment. Your hits are satisfying without being too powerful (unless you're the red knight with magic), you level up at just the right pace, and it doesn't drag on for too long.

Fantastic game for a fantastic price."

9623,"This game was a lot of fun to play through.  Its a great experience whether your playing single player or co-op locally, over internet, or with remote play (where your friends can join you and play even if they dont own the game).  Its a really fun side scrolling hack and slash beat em up with a lot of humor.  The gameplay is simple but entertaining and some of the music tracks are pretty awesome too.  I got about 20 hours out of the game before I decided I was done with it and those 20 hours I had a blast.  There are a ton of weapons to collect that will add many more hours if you want to 100% the game as well as animals orbs to collect hidden throughout the levels.  Overall its not a deep game or anything but for what it is it does it really well and thats why its been a fan favorite over so many console generations and continues to be beloved.  Definitely recommend it"

9628,its fun
9629,I absolutely enjoy this game. I've played it years ago on Xbox and decided to try it out again after all these years and I am not disappointed. Brings back a lot of old memories. Such a good game. Super goofy in a really good way.

9635,Fun game. Fun with a group of friends or alone. i like the choices of characters and abilities. Better with a controller in my opinion.

9637,POOOPIE
9638,"For a hack-and-slash type game it's really fun, enough so that I had to buy it on PC even though I already have it on Xbox 360 and Xbox One"

9656,"I've played this game to death on my 360. Getting to re-play it with 3 of my friends was one those gaming experiences that I'll never forget, ever. I've never been that good at video games and being able to spam the buttons on my controller while still being able to help was a treat to me. The skill tree in this game offers a good amount of depth. The art style is timeless. Get as many friends you can and you're bound to have a good time with this game. It's worth the full price, no need to wait for a sale."
9657,Fun
9658,"This is the game that just keeps giving. I played it drunk with my buddies on my couch back when it first came to Xbox Live on the 360, and I play it sober with my kid today in 2020 on Steam. It's great fun for up to four players at a time, with full couch-co-op as well as over the net co-op and even some more competitive game modes. Tons of unlockable unique characters, little secrets, collectables, and an 'insane mode' give this game a wonderful amount of replayability. The only issue I have with it is that the 2D sprites fighting in a 3D environment make it sometimes difficult to tell whether you're actually able to hit an enemy or not. Get the game, you won't be disappointed."
9659,"Have spent quite a while on this game. Even though it was hard, me and my friend were able to beat it together. I recommend playing this game with a friend rather than alone."

9671,"I love this game so much, its so much fun. go play it please, its worth it!"
9672,"I wasn't super interested in this game, based solely on the screenshots and playthrough vids. I scooped it up on a wicked sale, and hooo boy we're having a blast with it! The controls are simple and easy to learn, there's enough of a challenge to keep us interested and wanting to see what the next level holds (while also not being so hard as to make us throw our controllers at the screen.) fun trying to figure out the bosses weak spots, or how to finish the several little mini games you encounter. Nice RPG-style upgrade system where you can invest your upgrade points into magic, offense, defense, speed. Well worth the price I paid, and even more. Thumbs: UP!"

Parents getting divorced in the other room meanwhile me being 10 years old I'm playing Castle Crashers doing the level 256 glitch after coming home from Pop-Warner football practice. On a serious note one of my favorite games of all time would recommend for all ages and hopping on this game at 17 years old gives me a rush of nostalgia and the game is just as fun as when I was a little kid. RIP 256 Glitch.

9706,"This game is amazing, And its Really nostalgic, i do not recommend this tho if you have small arrow keys."
9707,"For a long time I thought Castle Crashers was just a very repetitive, boring game. But upon revisiting the game I think I realized Castle Crashers is legendary.

It's not repetitive - it's simple in design and yet enjoyable,  the combat is quite simple once you get used to it, the story is just princesses getting kidnapped and you have to save them by going on a huge adventure around the world and the amount of crazy shit you come across while doing so is what makes this game amazing. furball trolls, a giant cat-fish, an angry volcano, a dragon with a sock puppet, a fat bat, ninja pirates, gorgon, aliens from alien hominid, giant scorpions and antilions,  corn?? a toolboxhead artist and much more. The combat itself may be repetitive but the situations you're placed in are so chaotic it's extremely fun. Standing on top of a high speed caravan while fighting a boss behind you and getting swarmed by enemies, swimming in the river and riding random objects, running away from a huge troll or something while riding a diarrhetic deer in a windmil, the ninja pirates on a rocking ship, randomly playing volleyball and all of this with incredible fitting music. It's also filled to the brim with references and secrets/easter eggs.

The game doesn't try to be realistic, it doesn't try to make sense, it was just made to be funny and insanely fun successfully. Therefore the only thing that has aged after 8 years is the combat in my opinion, everything else is still perfect and still allows for replayability."
9708,"very good with 3 friends, would be ok alone"
9709,This is a childhood classic for me and the boys. Countless hours on xbox 360 jammin out to this amazing game. Some points made us rage and others laugh until our throats hurt. This game is awesome. If you haven't played this game before you are missing out.

The game is replayable as hell and can offer countless hours of laughs and fun."

Besides the main story, there are also many unexplained secrets and unlockables, which I have enjoyed pursuing afterwards."
9783,"Opa, tudo bom? então, eu jogava Castle Crashers desde o Xbox 360, e eu sempre curti muito o jogo, ja zerei muitas vezes no console, e ja cheguei a jogar a versão pirata do jogo, porem decidi comprar a original, pra dar aquela moral pros criadores do jogo, e também pq esse jogo merece, ao contrario das outras plataformas, no PC só tem 2 dlcs. que são do cavaleiro roxo, e da cavaleira rosa, que possuem poderes e espadas diferentes, inclusive, as duas são bem baratas, porem se esperar uma Steam Sale da vida, vai ser melhor.

Não vou dizer que o jogo é perfeito, porem chega bem perto, com level design legal, e inimigos, que na maioria das vezes, são bem balanceados, achei que zeraria bem rapido, tipo em 3 horas, no maximo, porem enrolei muito jogando os modos de Arena, e também aquele outro que eu não lembrarei o nome, mas cada personagem possui habilidades que possuem vantagens e desvantagens, em certas partes do jogo, também os pets te ajudam nessa questão, como na fase da Floresta dos Ladrões, e também na fase da Medusa, o pet Cavalo Marinho Verde, te ajuda a andar mais rapido onde tem água.

Ou a galinha, que aumenta sua força, defesa, e agilidade, o jogo também possui um sistema de niveis que vc acumula 1 ponto a cada 1 nivel upado, que pode ser usado pra melhorar as condições: Força, Magia, Defesa, e Agilidade.

Enfim, o resto é so jogando mesmo para saber, espero ter ajudado quem esta querendo comprar, assim como as DLCS, compre em uma Steam Sale, que fica mais barato do que ja é.

Nota Geral do Jogo: 10/10
Level Design: 9/10

acho que é isso `-`, falou."

9821,"fun hack & slash game - even more fun with friends, either on the couch or online. Lots of characters to unlock, weapons to find, and little animal orbs to help you out. but this is my only con for this game - the unlockable characters and the collecting of weapons and orbs is really the only reason to replay it at all. not a huge replay value. beating the game with a character unlocks ""Insane Mode"", which is pretty much just ""New Game +"" - same game, just much harder.

Despite that one con - the game is totally worth the purchase and I still totally recommend this game to anyone that's a fan of the genre."
9822,nostalgia.
9823,"Castle Crashers is one of the best, maybe even the best game, from the 2000's. Its wonderful variety of enemies, bosses and pets make it all the more interesting. The collection of knights and characters you can play as is magnificent, making sure everyone has a character to play! It has great fighting mechanics and lots of weapons to choose from. Overall it is the best indie game to ever be made! Also, show some love to the developers, they need it!"

9829,"I've played this game before excessively on XBOX 360 and now still on my Switch. The game itself is very enjoyable with a fun art style and easy to learn game play. However, if you plan on playing this game I HIGHLY recommend using a game controller of some kind. Using a keyboard with this game is extremely difficult, but if you're stubborn, you're more than welcome to try.  It is very enjoyable in single player, but I've encountered some major lag while playing with friends online. Some of us don't have the best internet which could have contributed, but if one online player has a bad connection, their lag is your lag comrade. If you're able to overcome these issues then you are in-store for a very fun time."

"
9836,oeh
9837,"Castle Crashers is a game that will surprise you.  The art style of the game alone is great, but the gameplay is intuitive and engaging as well.  While the story is short that actually works well for the game as completing the story with a character will unlock another character from the game and there are tons to choose from.  Basically (almost) any enemy in the game can become a main character with the right unlocks.  This is a game I could play a lot and lose track of time."
9838,Still hasn't lost its addiction!
9839,great game to play with friends.
9840,Really fun with friends. I remember playing this game on Xbox as a kid. It's still as good as I remember.
9841,This game is so gosh darn great
9842,"addictive without a doubt , a mix of charcters and moves change as you level up. 
Bosses are cool. and just fun gameplay from this title. My son played with me and loves it !!!
variety of levels and enemies make this game a must play."

9846,one of the best games i ever playedhope for a sequel some day
9847,it good
9848,childhood memories
9849,BADAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSS. love it! it works just like it did back on Xbox 360 and the Xbox 360 controller. most games don't have the same set up like this one does!
9850,"It's a original that's very fun when playing solo, multiplayer, and especially with friends. It is 100% worth the 15$ with what this game brings to the table, with different game modes, and lots of knights that you can unlock and level up, and more. There is only one problem and that's that at first the controls are a little wonky for keyboard and mouse, but you can change them easily. It might not be very popular now, but it's still a great game and you can get a 4 pack for your friends at a decent price."
9851,kk
9852,"for what i played, wery good game"
9853,"Fun 2 play solo online n even more so w/ pals. Theres a few achieves both solo n multiplayer.  Love the graphics n comedic style. Really a nostalgic timeless classic.💖

9877,fun but only with friends
9878,"This game is my childhood, one of the best indie games out there in my opinion. Very re-playable, is fun, has some grind but not too much where you end up filing down your fingers from smashing your keys too hard, so overall, it's worth its price."
9879,"awsome game, but bosses too hard not that im a little whiny bitch but they should make them a tiny bit easier or less tedious especially the ice boss which is the most annoying boss cause he you just hit him for like 15 minutes strait"

9888,This game is very fun and addictive! A little frustrating at times but it's all a part of the fun. I used to play this on the Xbox 360 and was very happy to get back to it on PC. Very much would recommend this for anyone looking to have a blast either with their friends or by themselves.

9917,"Beat 'em ups done right. The only thing this game is missing really is ultimate abilities with a super meter, to top things off. But other than that, the music's amazing, the combat's super fun, and the adventure's quite funny. The game doesn't have a lot of glitches that effect the game, and I'd highly recommend this game to my friends."

9932,"Oh, my, I haven't been this enjoyed a game since the year that Flash is phasing out!!

Flash, a so-called ""bugsive"" plugin, is dying in its dusk with merciless criticism of Tech companies, so as my childhood memories. Those lite-size, fast-paced, stylish painted flash games which enriched my childhood are fading away in the replacing process of HTML5.

Unlike others, The Behemoth, maker of Castle Crashers, stick to their hand drawn style and easy-to-take story telling pattern like a lonely warrior facing the trend of ""realistic, 3D and intense violence involved"" in game market. 

It's really hard to find another game like this in recent years. Demand is changing as devices are upgrading, we are seemingly chained competition to games so much that people seldom have friends or play an RPG alone to experience the happiness from EXP accumulation or passing a tricky Boss battle like the Windows XP years."
9933,"Holy shit its amazing, so many flash backs, so many things I remember 11 years ago, Truly astonishing, Good game 10/10, Would recommend."
9934,"I LOVE THIS GAME!! just playing it, you can feel a lot of time and love was put into this game. Like all Behemoth games, there is a plethora of  personality."
9935, Want a more modern take on TMNT Turtles In Time/Sunset Riders etc.?  This is a perfect fit.  4 player couch carnage at it's finest.

9983,I had this game back on XBOX 360 and had to pick it up again. It still retains its amazing couch coop material. Its not-so-subtle humor and easy to pick up gameplay was a perfect entry to gaming with the SO on the couch. I only wish there was DLC or a sequel available.

as an avid gamer that was the only game i was able to play that wasnt a point and click game. needless to say it was hella fun to get that rpg feel without having to load up any of the heavy rpgs that require both hands.
so if you only have one hand this game is pretty nifty"

10084,"Fun game, Grind-able, beating the game and finishing the final boss is not the end, it is the start of a new beginning. However the game is not worth 15 dollars. I bought a four pack on a holiday sale, for this deal it is much worth the price."
10085,"There Is a Chicken Pet and sword. 10/10
My only concern is that it isnt fried. (Jimmy! I already told you! Its not cannibalism if they aren't the same species! A Goose Can Eat a Chicken If it wanted To! Chickens are just the cousins geese never Wanted!) Like I was saying, Good stuff, Needs More Kentucky Fried Chicken."
10086,This takes me back to my xbox days.
10087,"Absolute classic that appeals to a large audience! If you like fun, childlike fun with good humor then this game is for you!"
10088,not a bad game for its price there are a ton of characters to unlock and choose from with for the most part unique and diverse powers. great fun with friends not the longest game but it has extra game modes to keep you entertained as well.

10102,CASTLE! CRASH! THIS GAME IS PRETTY VIOLENT BUT VERY FUN!
10103,"i once pooped myself, and maybe you will too :)"
10104,"I had a blast with Castle Crashers. It’s basically a modern take on old school beat ‘em ups. You collect power ups and weapons along the way and smash enemies while you are side scrolling. The biggest strength of Castle Crashers is its humor. There are not many good games out there that can make you laugh and Castle Crashers is one of the few. Boss fights are entertaining and graphics are charming.

This is one of those games that is meant to be played co-op. You will get much more out of it with a friend. Strongly recommended to any Golden Axe fan.

"
10105,"It's a great game, and I've got a ton of nostaliga for it. It was great to see a PC version.
HOWEVER, the online mode is completely broken. Trying the troubleshooting options given by the developers helped with nothing, and the game is now rendered unplayable after just a few hours. This wouldn't be a problem but this game solo is extremely boring and repetitive."
10106,"very fun game. very nostalgia inducing, had this game on the ps3. would recommend to play with friends"
10107,This game stands the test of time.  Its addicting gameplay and great replayability on top of the humorous tone and multiplayer makes it my favorite steam game.

10139,review
10140,Its pretty rad to play with friends if you have any. but with the price so low its definitely worth the price
10141,"I remember first playing this when I was five, just came back to it recently, and honestly, it’s still great.
A nice not too long but not too short campaign that’s an absolute blast to play with your friends.
It’s not very hard to 100% just gets tedious after awhile.

I recommend, for if your the kind of person who likes 100%ing’ games or likes playing games with your friends."

10145,Good
10146,great game would be nice if they added like a dlc that added another charater with more levels but besides that great game
10147,"Amazing game, beat almost every character and a good portion of insane mode on the xbox360 version of the game. Lots of replay value. If you can't tell I have an unhealthy obsession with this game."

10153,i like it because its a fun game where you try to get to the end i like this game alot.
10154,"its creative and pretty unique but 2d beat em ups are kinda boring for me most of the time, props for what it did during it's time tho"
10155,"this game is a total ripoff. you get advertised that you play with 3 other knights, but when you launch the game you are by yourself??? this game contains blatant false advertising and music stolen from newgrounds. if you waste your money here, prepare for a MAJOR disappointment"
10156,you heard of the jelly sandwich?
10157,"I just LOVE when I repeatedly get hit by random attacks and can't stand up, but other than that, game is poggers and based."

I remember always playing this, Halo 3, and Halo: Reach with my buddies, with the exception of Minecraft, which just released, but I digress.
If you want to reminisce on the glory days, definitely get this, its just as great as it was 18 years ago"

10192,What a great funny haha game

10198,"A metric crap ton of fun if you like A) side-scrollers or B) single/multiplayer games. Plus, the art is on point for an older game. It just goes to show that a game doesn't need high-grade, 4k graphics to be good! 10/10, would recommend! GO NEWGROUNDS!"
10199,"I definitely didn't buy this game on all of my systems no why would i do that that is silly.....

Yeah I have a problem"

10202,this game is poggers
10203,good
10204,"This is a fun game! I personally like it because it's not too long but not too short, you can sit at your pc for 7 hours and complete it. Also, it's pretty challenging at some points. The co-op works well! This game is a game that you can genuinely play more than once because of the variety, you can be a big powerhouse, a magic master, or a nimble archer. The different characters (Lightning, ice, etc.) allow you to change your playstyle to your preference. Recommended 101%."
10205,Such a fun game would really recommend it to play with friends. Top 10 greatest games of all times when you play with multiple irl friends.

10209,"Its certainly a fun game to play friends, or even just solo. I'd def recommend!!"
10210,good game to play with a friend.
10211,Very good game to play solo in since it's a 2D hack and slash game and it's even better playing it with friends.
10212,This is a really really fun game i reallly enjoy the charac terts the story line and all the cool abilities so i reccomend this to you

10216,"Castle Crashers is one of my favorite games ever, I originally played it on my xbox but it's still as amazing as I remember it. It's  fun to play with friends especially but playing alone is just as fun. Though even after you beat the game, you can try out the Insane mode which is basically the same game but way harder, but even after that there are 2 other modes which are the arena mode and back off barbarian mode, Arena is a blast to play with friends, the best arena modes are Melee and Beefy.
I can't say the same with back off barbarian though, though ik some people are into puzzle type games so don't knock it til' you try it! I rate this game a 9/10!"

10256,"Pretty cool if you ask me. Nice to play after finishing it on the XBox a couple of years ago. My opinion? This game is worth the buy, especially if you play it with friends."

10264,This is a classic. Do yourself a major favor and get the game even if you never end up playing. one day you are goign to get a few friends over and with nothing to do take this out. or use it to keep a few kids entertained for a while.

10269,me very likey this game cuz i remember when me played on ps3 and me feel nostagicly but the game is still very good after all of these years and even better with friends
10270,"A funny game, but, to be true, just play with your friends. This game is made to play together, because otherwise it'll get shitty to play. You'll be bother with the repetition on the fases itself. Even though, i recommend a lot if you want a funny game to spend some time with your friends."
10271,Story mode is a bit easy when you have multiple players. It's challenging but not very hard to complete when you're solo. No use of optical mouse/trackpad (that's good).
10272,fun
10273,good
10274,"Great game with great fighting system and great outcome , there are a lot of problems with this game such as bosses you may don't know how to attack or damage , cant tell where you are on the screen (happens more on multiplayer) and now dealing enough damage . but , if we are just playing with or without friends , the game is just addictive , the fighting system , the stupid but fine story (its a bitmap game for god sake you dont need story for a bitmap game) and a lot more . castle crashers is a great game , he has a lot of problems but its good 
rating ; 8/10 (btw much more enjoyable while playing with friend)
co-op rating : 9/10 much more fun !"
10275,Awesome. Nothing else to say
10276,incredibly unbalanced stats wise. The only good stats are defense and magic. It sucks. But that don't mean its not fun.
10277,"This game is a fuck ton of fun both with, and without friends. It also gives me nastolga on when I played it on the XBOX 360."

10313,i kinda like it
10314,I played this game as a young lad on the PlayStation 3 and i like it and its now on switch and steam and now i can play a game that i used to play everyday with my baby brother. Best Game ever.

10316,cool
10317,"hey that's pretty good
"
10318,Gray Knight
10319,"While not for everyone, this is game is fun as heck. A side scroller beat em up with that sweet sweet newgrounds artstyle. The game honestly still holds up to today. The two dlc characters are only a buck each and 100% of those funds goes to charity. 

The game however is a bit short, and can be a bit of grind-fest once you've beaten all the levels once, so you better enjoy playing through those same enviroments because you're going to be seeing them a lot. And while this sort of thing usually bugs the crap out of me, the cute environments and all the little things happening in the background really make the levels fun to through again. 

Where this game really shines is with friends, this is prime party game material folks. It is so fun to go in with new or pre-leveled characters with friends and just, well, beat 'em up. Just going through the stages laughing all the way. Also, there's a free demo, so if you're even mildy interested just play that right here on steam and you'll get a feel for it."

10322,grate game totally recommend it
10323,"GOOD

10324,"Funny, very replayable, so much to unlock, and enjoyable gameplay. Something could be said for more unique characters, giving them different base stats and removing the copycats by making them different in some way, but over all, a swell game."

10341,Yes.
10342,"I started playing Castle Crashers when I was a young boy. It was an integral part of my early teen years and I have never found a game that itches the same spot as castle crashers. I love it so very much that I have it on pc, ps3, xbox360, and the switch. This game is absolutely outstanding, a easy buy for anyone who wants to have fun by yourself or with 3 other friends."

no FR dou its a good game and more fun with friends!"
10350,"]
"
10351,So cool
10352,"I love this game, but I am feeling that the developers never maintained it correctly.

* The game do not save the status after each level. Only completing certain levels make the game save their completition
* Several multiplayer synchronization problems in the desert area, specially the alien ship
* when you play multiplayer, the game show any level done by one of the players, it is shown as done...
* each time you touch a sandwitch (not sure about other objects), the selected object is replaced with the sandwitch, so if you were spamming arrowsyou suddenly see your character transforming into the bigger version (which usually is not good for a dex build)

When you combine the two first issues you can see yourself and friends repeating the same levels several times in a row...
And with the third one (the map showing levels done by only one player as done for all) the same, you can see your group repeating the last boss fight to end the game without the end game reward because your character lacks one level to be done...

All those type of problems can be solved in a low cost way, so if they do not patch it up... Shame on you, Behemot!!!
"
10353,This game is so good I keep farting
10354,this game is pretty cool
10355,don't waste your time like i did
10356,its just like among us
10357,Amazing game. certainly worth the price if you have friends to play it with. if youre only going to be playing solo then its still a very good game however playing it with friends just makes it that much better
10358,"     Alright. I'm going to try my best to make this review cover most things you need to know about the game to help.
I have been playing this game for around 8 years now, and i can remember really enjoying the game back on the Xbox 360.
I decided to visit the game again in 2019 and it just absolutely blew me away how well they made the pc version of it!
I found it very fun playing the game, and had no issues overall. If you want to know a few things about the game that you might need to know, then please keep reading.
The game can be complete in only a few hours if you are experienced enough, and the thing that kept me playing for far past that amount of time is the fact that you can play each character you unlock twice. Once on normal, second on insane mode. Insane mode is very much harder to beat, and the title really says it. So that could take way longer to beat then normal. And the best part is, beating the game with a certain character will unlock another character, And so forth. Go here if you need help with that! https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1634645109
There's pets that boost certain stats and help, Tons of hidden weapons to boost certain stats but possible weaken others. It is very fun and requires a lot of skill to master! If you want a fun story game that doesn't ever leave you feeling bored, this is the game for you. Amazing playing experience, Amazing soundtrack, And an amazing story. 
overall i rate this game 11/10. If you are thinking about getting it, but don't know if you should, take my advice and give it a shot. Thank you :)"
10359,Super fun to play with friends! i play it with my gf and other friends and its funn

10371,great game needs more stair deaths 11/10 but if updated with a stair death 9000/10
10372,"This game can get fairly difficult and grindy if you don't have much experience, but I came back to this game after 6 hours of playtime and became addicted. I've beaten the game several times as blue knight, industrialist and fencer, levelled fencer up to level 82 and I'm still enjoying it. Also, it's without a doubt better with friends."

10431,why do their heads look like that?
10432,"This is a good game. I'm trying to 100% it and accidentally deleted my save file with 30-40 hours. But I'm way farther now. It's good single player if you don't have friends, if you do have friends it's even better. My only complaint is that the online is absolute garbage. 99% of the time you're in an empty lobby and if there is someone they leave after 3 levels or 1 match of the mini-games."
10433,very gud
10434,Best game
10435,nice simple couch coop game. great to play with my son
10436,game is fun with 4 people
10437,play
10438,is a gamer
10439,swag as hell
10440,I spent 50 hours playing this game in the first week owning it. It's truly a really good game
10441,reminds me of the old xbox days.
10442,"This would be a good game if the bosses weren't all just boring damage sponges with annoying, repetitive attack patterns why the fuck did the last boss have 6 fucking phases and why the fuck did he just inflate in two of them i don't recall pyrocynical making this game and how the fuck did he just turn into this massive std looking fat fuck and randomly come out of a chest it makes no fucking sense whatsoever and why the fuck did he only have 1 or 2 different attacks in every phase i came here to fight decent, original bosses not waste 10 minutes of my life spamming left click so i could hit some little bitch wizard with the motor capacity of a literal fucking fetus."
10443,it stole my family but its pretty good
10444,"its fun game to be playing with full party (4 player)

GG"
10445,Simple graphic and artstyle but fun and hilarious in gameplay. Recommend to play with friend and family.
10446,Cool game to play with friends.

10454,very fun
10455,One of the best games I've ever played. GET IT
10456,This game is very nostalgic to me so maybe that's why i love it so much but the characters are really cool and i love that this isn't a pay to win type of game. Since i'm stupid i never use a tactic and just boost my strength all the way which worked so i'm glad this game works for stupid people like me too.
10457,"fun

10458,i am a bird. and this bird approves.

10460,i get to play with friends
10461,"This is one of my favorite games of all time. Played this game back when it was an Xbox Arcade game, when i was like 5 and had so many good memories with it. Instant classic and super fun to play with friends. Highly recommend."
10462,Buy this or ur bad
10463,Indeed
10464,"for a fucking hour, I have been losing to stupid ass volley ball AI in the sand castle roof part, I did not play this game to do stupid broken AI optical illusion volley ball. I quit the game at this point."

This is a steal for the price it is right now, It's extremely to play with your friends and can be played for a long ass time before it gets boring.

Cons:
Some people may walk in to a glitch where they can't hear any sound neither in the game or a discord or steam call (Happened to my friend)."

10526,Fun and simplistic co-op. Kinda short with zero meaningful replayability.
10527,"i played this game on my friends house his xbox 360 when i was like 9 years old (i remember we once played the beta/demo instead of the full game by accident and we both got scared by that troll that appears in the barbarian boss fight)

i saw this game on steam in 2018 and many memories came back to my head and i decided to buy it

this game is an absolute blast

i love the fun combat and combos that you can make with your sword and magic, the enemies and bosses are memorable and original, the pets dont change the gameplay much but they just help you by finding secrets, fighting enemies or healing you.

also that soundtrack tHAT BEAUTIFUL SOUNDTRACK ITS AMAZING COME ON

this is very fun to play with friends, i played it with my best friend before and it was really fun even tho she sucked at it lol

10/10, was a part of my childhood :)"
10528,This game is good. I like this game.
10529,"A fun time little beat'em up with role playing elements. Cute characters design, decent combat mechanics and laughable humor. The hand draw characters makes this game stands out and I out right love it."

10531,the best multiplayer experience in gaming
10532,"very pog.

10534,It's an good game pretty much any pc can run it it takes about 6-8  hours to beat it an good co-op game also its always fun to see whos gets the princess and its also cheap you cant go wrong with it
10535,Very very very fun
10536,very good if you like beat 'em up games. especially fun with friends. back off barbarian mode is annoying as hell
10537,night

10551,funny combo
10552,a absolute masterpiece
10553,"Very nice game! A generally small game but there are a lot of things to do:
-Once you finish the game you can play on the hardest difficulty. Believe me when I say. It is hard VERY HARD
-You can play fun minigames or play arena with your friends and test new characters.
-There is a variety of enemies
-Easy to learn hard to master combos.
The only downside to this game is that it is quite small. But you should give it a try. 
"
10554,YOU SMELL LIKE DUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HAGAGAGAHOOG
10555,This game always gets my heart pumping when I play it. I love stumping out the black guys heads over and over again.

10575,fun
10576,fun game
10577,"Just a chill, relaxed, fun, slashing kind of game"
10578,Still a fantastic side-scrolling beat em' up today. Castle Crashers has aged with excellency and holds up well against other titles in it's genre in 2020. I highly recommend this title to anyone looking for some fun multiplayer action.
10579,it is a game where you can do things and walk around
10580,i hate the color green

If you have not found Castle Crashers® fun, i don't know what will satisfy you."

10604,this is the most upbeat game ive ever played. the cherry on top is the overly exaggerated gore
10605,"This was a childhood game of mine. I have fond memories of second grade, me, my best friend and his brother all hugging and jumping when we finally beat the game. That luster still holds up today. Every slash, smash or crash still fills me with a child-like giddyness. Please pick up this game, you will not regret it."
10606,fun with friends and the air combos go brrrrr
10607,gud game
10608,.
10609,I like to crash castles.

If she happened to have thick thighs that would be nice but at this point i dont care."
10619,Very good!
10620,good old school fun for every1

10633,i haven't played this game in 5 years and holy shit is it good to play it again
10634,There is no reason not to buy it.

10642,Butt jokes
10643,fun awesome with friends
10644,"Una campaña bastante entretenida, es un muy buen juego ya sea que lo juegues solo o con amigos, la mejor manera que yo te recomendaria para jugar esto seria con amigos o tus familiares, si tienes control de xbox te viene como anillo ya que el co-op se puede realizar de una forma demasiado comoda, compralo en cualquier oferta, es un juego que al precio al que se suele poner en oferta no debe faltar en tu biblioteca"
10645,it good
10646,goot
10647,funny bear :)
10648,Its a great game to play with friends but if you are looking to be playing a game for a long time don't buy this because its too short(the story!)
10649,IT WAS THE BEST GAME EVER! NOTHING MORE TO ADD.
10650,This is one of the best games ever. I totally recommend it. You can be different knights and level them up.  You help the king get his crystals back and safe the princess's. And best of all you can play with friends. You can also play with a xbox remote.
10651,"This game has been a big part of my childhood since I was four. I got it on my Xbox 360, and when I saw it was on Steam, I knew I had to get it again."
10652,This game is very fun I have not even gotten bored after you get good enough to get the ram pet the game is just fun overall and has lots of crude humor which is best humor would plus the game is very cheap would and is fun to play with friends.
10653,This game is very poggers
10654,Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
10655,"pretty fun game with friends, and actually requires skill. Or maybe im just bad..."
10656,"This one the best childhood games and its still so good I would play this for 40 hours straight and smile the whole time the art style is so unique and charming and the overall humor aspect added to the classic beat-em-up platformer along with magic, weapons, and pets makes for one of my all time favorite games by far."
10657,just button mash
10658,"it's very nice game because some hard play 24/7 and pump your level, but the game will drag on even after passing it, since there are a lot of characters that are given to you depending on the passage of the branch for this or that character. I played for the ice knight, and I really liked the gameplay for the ice knight, I still thought about how to create an animation for me about the passage of my friend diment0ra and me, how we defeated all the bosses there. In general, I really liked the game, I recommend everyone to play it!"
10659,yup yup
10660,good
10661,The game is very fun it has very fun fighting and characters and some funny moments to and a good storyline with it
10662,"This is probably one of the worst purchases I have ever made and I didn't even buy it. The game play is just so immense and so intriguing that I cannot stop playing it. The blue guy is my person favorite because blue is my favorite color. Whales are the largest on Earth. I really recommend this game to anyone who wants to waste their time by playing something that has way too big of a price tag on it. On sale, $3 is way too much money for a game like this. The dialogue is the best part about the game. The voice acting that the clashers represent is horrific and I hope EA doesn't make this mistake again. Otherwise I will be upset and still buy it. Very good game for a someone and their friend. 10/10"
10663,stop stealing my food drops
10664,where the fuck is castle crashers 2
10665,never finished game but looks good
10666,"Cool I guess, nice game. :D"
10667,Might be the best Co-op game on steam. Very cool and good
10668,"A truly great game, brings back a lot of memories for me. I wish that there was more content for $15 though."
10669,i crashed ur mom into a castle
10670,Ou yeah!
10671,Crusade to your mom house
10672,epic game

10678,Amazing game!
10679,One of the better beat-em-ups out there...especially with friends.
10680,good wit friend
10681,Had a mental breakdown fighting the coneheads.. will keep you updated as i continue.
10682,Great game for coop
10683,"Fun solo, with friends or online. Would recommend."
10684,A fantastic game me and my friends always can come back to for the banger OST fun game play and light hearted humor and it even has RPG elements in it! I can defiantly recommend to anybody who didnt experience it when it released!
10685,a very fun game to play with friends
10686,its really fun and epic
10687,top rated for a reason
10688,"Shawty like ameldoldy but not like the joy and pleasure i fgeee,l when playing sonic also buy sonic generatikons"
10689,
10690,"The first time I played this game, I played it for an hour without even realizing it. This game is more difficult than I thought it would be, more fun than I thought it would be, and just a general hoot. I will say, however, that there are some aspects that are not really made very clear and you either have to waste a bit of time trying to figure it out or look it up online, but there are only a few of these."
10691,Had fun playing it
10692,good
10693,it good
10694,brabo
10695,"this game is just perfect. amazing gameplay, classic nostalgic retro graphic, and so fun to play with friends. And I'm very happy to bought this when on sale as well :D"
10696,"This game is the best co-op casual experience. It's funny, has great music and is filled with memorable bosses."
10697,betar mulheres
10698,i liked this game because its a classic 2d side scrolling alction and i like the combat the bosses its just so creative
10699,Incredibly enjoyable game. Hack and slash with a decent depth in character build.
10700,SMASH
10701,"i clocked in about 100+ hours wit my friends on this game back on xbox 360 whenever they came over

had a lot of good memories with this game. still holds up pretty well today tbh

you wont regret it if you get this game"
10702,It's a pretty good game
10703,Great beat-em up.
10704,Still a great game after all these years !

10715,this game good
10716,Awesome game! Had a lot of fun with friends.
10717,so fun
10718,"This game is really fucking good, but difficult to control on pc."
10719,fun and silly button mashing game to play
10720,yes
10721,"Great multiplayer hack and slash style game with a wide variety of levels, weapons, characters, pets and a good sense of humor. Makes for a fun game to play through multiple times to unlock even more things to use. You can play single player but it's not as fun and chaotic without other people to help join your epic quest."
10722,You ride a deer that propels itself by shitting itself running away from a giant sock thing. Great game.
10723,Amazing game even though it is 12 years old.
10724,"good game, the juggling bug is amazing to do because you can get levels so fast."
10725,need CC 2
10726,i was in a server then a child said i was a sexy. very cool and props to yu you prop hiders hahahahaha. yes yes good game but gamer need the game to load mods for gamer to equal better? yes!

10729,funny
10730,"This game is pretty hard single player, but multiplayer it's pretty good."
10731,"game gud
"
10732,"This game is just a classic. Though the story is pretty simplistic, its a wild ride from start to finish. The insane mode, the arenas and the dozens of characters provide a sweet reason to come back for more. If you like saving princesses, whimsical moments, becoming a literal god and just tearing everything apart in your path, this is the game for you."
10733,like
10734,"Multiplayer is wayyy more fun then singleplayer, but this game is great. For how much it costs you couldn't go wrong."
10735,Simple and fun.
10736,I LOVE THIS GAME ITS THE BEST DANG THING EVER!!
10737,Very good and fun CO-OP game to play with your friends 10/10
10738,wbest for engin a in the boge FUN!!!
10739,"I am giving a ""no"" recommendation mostly because of the ""Gore Setting"" that do not work as expected. 
When turned off you can see blood spurting everywhere , chunked bodies in the background, flying cut off heads. Is that really a Gore Off?
"

10742,"Fantastic game that is a timeless classic, Played it when it first released on the ps3 and put in at least a hundred hours. Purchased it again through steam and its still a blast. 100% recommended though I HIGHLY suggest using a controller to pull off combos easier."
10743,Sequel When?
10744,pretty good
10745,i love this game but i wish i had friends to play it with
10746,"in the biz, we like to call this a shallow and pedantic game"

10754,awesome game despite it being old first released on xbox 360 things still get interesting
10755,"The Zenith of all indie games past and present; Castle Crashers had aged phenomenally in the vast and expansive sea of Steam money-launderers. The very much crude, yet charming visuals had been eye candy ever since age 4. Rpg-lite progression and a quirky cast of playable characters gives this bombastic world some degree of replay value.                                                    

9/10: coming from the Xbox-360 version (In which I sunk hundreds of hours into), the additional content had helped to further engage older fans, and it's only like a buck on sale."

10757,Good Newgrounds Game

10764,The best game ever i used to play this with my brothers on the xbox 360 and now there's a remastered and on pc its amazing
10765,"I love this game and my 3 other friends never got to play it, so we all bought it to play online. This game is phenomenal- but the online is IIIIINCREDIBLY LAGGY. It made it impossible to play. We made it all the way past the lava section and decided to quit because playing online is excruciatingly difficult. So sad because I love this game and it was such a dope game for us all to play. 

VERY GOOD COUCH CO-OP GAME.
VERY BAD ONLINE CO-OP GAME."
10766,"This is a good game. its a fun beat e'm up, it good with friends and the leveling system is simple but adds a bit of depth. Its good.
Why won't I recommend it? Because the river level can die in a fire.
You gate the rest of game behind this PITA and that means playing this awful portion, after you're nice and invested. and yes, I got past it with friends and the rest of the game is still good. But that part sucks. And it forces you to play the suck til you beat it. and it sucks. So no I don't recommend it.
Because the river level sucks.
Also, it is definitely aimed at co-op cause archers are also a pain if you're solo."

PS: I also did the glitch it was very pog champ that's why I have 90 hours in this game lololololol 

PS PS: I made my friend (Isaiah) cry because I made fun of his weight and made fun of his parents being  divorced and I called his mom wailord from pokemon

10777,"I played this game originally on xbox however years ago and I loved it, so playing it now is fun for nostalgic as well as straight up fun reasons."
10778,I like that its pvp and stuff
10779,A classic fun fantasy themed comedic beat em up. Pretty fun with friends or for some relaxing stress relief.
10780,"Cute art style, lots of content to replay the game for, a ton of varied characters, and interesting pets. the one thing I have to say is there are way too many poop/diarrhea gags (like seriously it's just uncomfortable and not funny anymore after the first time). If you don't mind the sight of a random animal crapping itself violently then it's a good game otherwise"
10781,I just love this game and its art style.
10782,an absolute classic.
10783,"A fun classic that can run on practically anything. When they say use a controller, they mean it. Using either a Steam Link controller, a DualShock 4, or an Xbox Controller, adds a beautiful element of meaningful [b]button-mashing."
10784,Fun game. Play it on console.
10785,"This game is amazing, I played it 5 years ago and im playing it again, the nostalgia and gameplay is unmatched<3"
10786,"Fun game to play with friends. It does get boring playing by yourself, so make sure you've got a good group of pals."
10787,xbox 360
10788,my mind is clear
10789,"Fun game to play and laugh with friends, and I love the variety of pets and weapons. Judging by my profile picture, the necromancer is my favorite character, even though I have yet to unlock him as a character. Overall one of the best four player co-op games in my opinion. One con I guess is the extra game mode is a bit lacking, as I wish they had more like battleblock theater. Another is that I feel the catfish boss has an overlooked exploitable weakness that is shielding his punches. 4/5"
10790,This game is incredibly fun to play with friends. The story line is altogether entertaining and the different graphics definitely add to that. I enjoyed playing this game with my friends and would definitely recommend it to others.
10791,A fun party game that you and your friends can meme around with. Has casually competitive aspect of getting with all the princesses :D
10792,So much fun and hidden easter eggs to find with friends.
10793,top tier

10797,"Great game, get it on sale"
10798,I like it!  I like it!
10799,I think it is worth the money it's super fun and i would only recommend it if you like battle games and it's super fun but it may be hard to get the hang of.
10800,"hey kids sanic here and today i'm gonna review castle crashers,
yes very good highly recommend it very fun and multiple characters to select from,
you may be wondering, Sanic how come its a great game but u only have 6.8 hours on it?

10808,"This is a very fun game. i have spent much of my time playing it in the past that it was the only game i used to play. the humor in this game is very childish (which i enjoy) 

like, who doesn't want to see a deer crap himself across the FUCKING night sky?? 

only problem i have with this game is that i played it to the point where i didn't play anything else. it is very addicting and idc how many times i play it. its fun every time.

hold on, i have like multiple little kids attacking me while writing this. i gotta quick go Anakin Skywalker on their ass.

overall, very good game"

10811,pretty cool
10812,I pretty much grew up on this game and terraria but castle crashers is a super fun yet old game. This game is a lot more fun with friends for sure but thats not neccesary even when playing solo if you can get your motivation to play you wont want to stop playing this and I would really suggest getting this game if you want something cheap easy to play and quite fun.
10813,Amazing with friends
10814,Lots of fun. Lots of laughs.
10815,I BEAT DA BAD GUYS LIKE MY TEACHER BEAT ME
10816,"Hmmmm despite what my steam says I've had hundreds of hours on this game and it's really fun... Better to play with friends tho, which i do not have but it's still fun to play on your own."

10824,"I think this is the first game I bought from XBox Live. Anyway, we had a blast with this game, ended up playing through it several times. It's a great beat-em-up, sort of a cartoony Streets of Rage or whatever. The aerial combos are super fun and there are some insane abilities.

If you've got friends, make sure to bring them along!"

10831,It has the best start and  funny moments
10832,barbarian farted poo haha
10833,This game's ending was probably the biggest WTF I have ever had from a game.
10834,"This game is really cool, I recommend it for low spec PCs and for people that want a game with a lot of action and thats funny as well

"
10835,
10836,"this game is amazing and very good. It also is the best game. Have i mentioned how good the game is? this is good game and everyone should buy it. I've completed the game multiple times and it still isn't getting boring. Like seriously, This game is amazing and everyone should play it."

10849,"Very good game, I have completed insane a few times, and only plan on doing it again :D

Saldy i bought a 4 games pack and have 1 copy of the game for sale, add me if interested!"
10850,"One of few games I can play with my girlfriends for hours, definitely recommend if u have a controller"
10851,its fun to kill
10852,"I lay awake at night crying...wishing they made a sequel to this game so that I can once again experience the fun that it provides for the first time. The perfect 4 player coop experience that isn't needlessly complex and has enough character and charm for you to want to continue playing till the end. 

The art style is beautiful, the gameplay is based on the beat em up genre more akin to games like Streets of Rage or Double Dragon, but with way more responsive directional inputs from controls sticks compared to using a D-Pad. You can use magic and upgrade your character's stats as well as obtain new weapons, potions and consumable items that help you as you progress. 

The combat is simplistic but still has enough depth for you to want to keep on playing till the end which really works in the game's favour, thanks to this you could introduce anyone to this game and they'll enjoy the experience with friends cause of how much fun it is to play either locally or online. 

The variety in bosses and levels are insane and come with a lot of twists and turns that will have you laughing and enjoying every moment of it. The selection of characters is huge and they all have interesting and unique abilities, the multiplayer versus content is solid and fighting your friends in the story mode to decide who can kiss the princess after beating a boss is hilarious!

This is the game that showed me how much importance and fun indie games can provide, I felt this way back in 2009 and I am still being mind blown by this in 2020.

10875,"A classic, Best 2D RPG Game i've played."
10876,"Buy it, play it, such fun, much wow."
10877,"Every time I play this game it brings me back to my younger years in the best way. Through out the years of playing this game I always enjoyed the simple way of the combat, the story, the humor, the art style and the MUSIC (don't even get me started on these tunes my guy!) and even now it duck tapes a smile on my face every time I see the title screen. All of my closest friends joined me in the crusades to fight in fight for honor, glory, justice, and MEMES. Castle Crashers in my opinion is best played with friends and or as a challenge game like trying to beat the game with only arrows, a horn ect. I highly advise giving this S tier game chance and call up some friends you won't regret it."

10901,"I only played 6.6 hours so far because that's how much the main story offers, but there are 2 other game modes.  This game is just as good as I remembered the first 2 levels to be back in 2014. Definitely a buy"
10902,it gud.
10903,This game is fun with friend's I recommend this game
10904,"A chaotic, but casual game to play alone or with friends. Great for binge playing just for fun, but also great for distracting yourself from responsibilities :D"
10905,c
10906,AWESOME
10907,"Castle Crashers is a great game to play with friends. I play by myself, but it is less fun without friends."
10908,"I have played countless hours of this game on the xbox 360 edition. It was my favorite game for years from at least 1st grade till about 6th or 7th grade. I have so many memories of all the levels and my inability to beat them. I probably played every level like 20 times my first playthrough in order to even learn enough and make enough progress to move along. I didn't even beat the volcano level and cross the water for like the first 3 years lol. 
I absolute adore this game and while I sucked as a kid, its just the right amount of challenging. I would say that magic is kinda op, and as such I always used to invest in it heavily when I was younger and almost never played through as a melee build. This isn't a huge issue though, and if you just choose to not play that way it's not gonna ultimately make your playthrough less fun in any way. It has so much replayability and I particularly enjoy the character unlock feature. For me this creates a good motivation to play through again and unlock more characters. The game is best played with friends in my opinion, and makes a great local game to sit down with someone and play. The weapon progression is fun, and I particularly enjoy sustained the subtle mechanics that the game gets right. For example, when you unlock a weapon, you have access to it on your account across all characters. To compensate for this weapons have a level minimum, but this is easily achieved through normal play. The pets also allow for a nice level of customization and all around fun. 
All in all this game is a super fun casual game to play, but also has the potential to be a crazy fun time sink if you so choose. The insane mode harder difficulty also allows for much more play which is awesome. It includes different weapons pets variations which is quite cool and creates even more reason to level your characters."
10909,I would recommend this game as long as you're aware that sometimes during multiplayer there can be some serious frame drops
10910,"5 hours to 10 hour mark.

1 hour: I played this when I was younger, enjoying it, nostalgia, having a good time.

5 hours: I like to grind as orange knight, fav color, and I am happily playing as I listen to the music of my childhood.

10 hours: My first win, 10.5 hours

20 hours: Started to speedrun this game, 13 attempts total according to memory, all failures, I had to walk dogs, and never got past 20 minutes without having an incident to let me continue,

30 hours: 5 resets and then 3 wins against the final boss. I wanted to see how fast I could complete the game

40 hours: I spent the entire ten hours trying to see how far I could get in Back Off Babarian, but never got past 2 minutes. The timer is not accurate.

50 hours: Mindless attempting to get max level green knight on a reset. I spent 3 hours spam doing Industrial Castle.

60-80 hours: Left the game open, forgot to close before going to sleep.

90 hours: Mindless multiplayer with my dear friend!

100 hours: The big moment, 100 hours of this game. I celebrated with completing the game on green knight and my friend on blacksmith.

112 hours (Current at 1st edit): Mindless statistics and looking at things."
10911,"used to play this on the classic xbox 360, had a lvl 93 grey knight until i pressed the char reset button on accident. Now that i own it on pc i can enjoy getting my grey boi back up there.

I've already sat through two playthroughs in the past two days, and I loved every second of it. I'm planning on doing 22 more playthroughs and beat the arenas to get all of the characters.
[spoiler]The corn boss and the paint boss with any saw splash damage characters is very easy. That's my tip for the day.[/spoiler]
This is the perfect game to play without much of a commitment, and the ability to come back to it again and again is insane.

10961, get it nowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10962,"This Game Is A Classic, It looks Nice, and has a great soundtrack but some of the mechanics like the muscular/sandwitch enemies, and namely, the later bosses were atrocious, especally the final boss, while im glad I played it through with friends, I hate how drawn out, unfair, and plainly repetitive the final boss especally was, Theres no way I'll be bothering to unlock all characters, only get this game if you have 3 friends to play with, and its on a steep sale, But - I Do Not Reccomend, or Find Castle Crashers Fun Anymore."
10963,"Great game to play with friends played this game when i was a kid on my Xbox 360 and then got a PC and saw that it was on sale and bought it, probably one of my most favorite games."
10964,game good
10965,"In the olden days there owas only war and famine. But then a strange game released. This game was title ""castle crasher"". My point is get castle crashers or youre a beta-chump."
10966,"Castle Crashers
It's a very funny fun hard 2D arcade adventure
Story is save 4 princess and get the big crystal back i think that it 
I recommend playing this with some friends not easy playing on your own
There are 4 characters you can play at the start, but you have to unlock others by completing levels and challenges
The money you earn killing enemies and bosses but you don't share with your friends take all for yourself xd
You can level up your characters Strength, Magic, Defense, and Agility they all have different powers with each character
Leveling up can unlock combo fighting moves and magic as well
Weapons you can find on enemies sometimes drop, but it's rare to find and you can buy them in the shops
Shops will sell bombs, sword, health potions, sandwiches, and animal orbs
Cute animal orbs can help you throughout the game and they all have different abilities
Going through each level will be different environment, enemies bosses gameplay, it's not all the same very unique
Soundtrack is perfect it has some great vibe while fighting and shopping it doesn't feel the same at all 
There will be weird funny unexplained moments in this game 

cons
There are no checkpoints in this game so you have to be careful not to die
Enemies can do too much damage to you on some levels
It can be repetitive sometime

8.0/10 Need more health potions"

11082,"I am not exaggerating when I say that Life Is Strange is not only by far my all-time favourite game but also it is an experience which really had taken over me and gave me an emotional roller-coaster like no other game ever did.

I will not go into detail of the plot or anything else I will mainly talk about the astonishing experience I had playing Life Is Strange.

My favourite thing about the game is the character building. Life Is Strange we have early adults with problems like, the question of who you really are, your sexuality, your lifestyle, what to do with your life but not only that, further addressed topics are drug abuse, suicidal thoughts, violence and so much more, which makes the characters so unbelievable relatable and understandable for someone in the same age and same position. You not only get a real feeling for the characters thoughts and actions but also you get to the position where you t"

11089,"Just beat this game. I got trolled. There's still an Insane Mode. Great game. Action-packed fast-reaction type game. The bosses have certain tactics to learn and certain patterns to memorize. Some, though, like the final boss, are COMPLETELY RANDOM and harder to beat (On purpose, I guess). The options in this game are various, too. You could sword hunt, animal orb hunt, or go for the story and bosses. don't forget to block and use your bow! They are very important.
Anyway, the gameplay is great. It's almost like a drawn world, but put into certain action to make it feel real. You can also play with friends (easier), or play alone, like I did (harder).
Quick warning: Don't rage. The bosses may seem hard, but don't worry. Use healing potions and collect the fruit. I'm rooting for you.
(The day I posted this is the last day of the Steam sale! If you're thinking about buying it, do it now! It's currently only $2.99!!!)"

One of the game I have enjoyed the most in my life: well made, funny,  easy to play at first and really challenging on the crazy mode. Really high replayability, with a lot of secret stuff you just come up with after a lot of runs. 
This is one of those games you and your buddies will love and every now and then will come back to play."

You probably already know that a beat-em-up is better with friends, but somehow Castle Crashers makes it as fun to play alone. The community is some of the best as well, making huge guides and helping out new players. Buy this game and soon you won't be able to stop!"

Game includes an Insane Mode difficulty which increases the re-play value by A LOT, a long witch collecting pets, weapons, and characters!"

I definitely recommend it!"

A lot of guides didn’t say exactly what I needed, so if you go through all of them and it still doesn’t work, try changing your default communication device to the headphones or speaker you use through sound settings. Other than that, definitely a 5 star game!"

In my opinion i think that this is better then most mainstream games by a landslide, so if your thinking about buying this then i gaurenty it wont be a waste."

11270,nice
11271,I have fun killing my friend!
11272,Its Good
11273,"Would highly recommend Castle Crashers, extremely fun to play with friends brings a lot  of memories playing back in the days with my Xbox 360 with my family. The only thing i hate was the panda's screw them"
11274,"One of the MOST FUN game I've played (at my friend's PS). Words cannot contain how I enjoy this game. You'll often see me really invested in the game, smiling widely."

11277,Best game
11278,"This game never gets old. great side scroller with a sense of humor. Childish humor, but then again if you aren't a child at heart who thinks poop jokes are funny, why even bother to play games?

I come back to this game at least once a year."
11279,"As many have said before me; classic game. You cant go wrong picking this up. The combat is simple enough for anyone to pick up, but not so easy that you can just spam one key the whole game. Also comes with that Behemoth levels of weirdness throughout the game ( if you've played a Behemoth game before you know what i mean), which is always welcome in my eyes. Also its co-op so grab a couple of mates and pound through it if you're looking for something to play.

If i were to make a gripe about the game i can think of two things. Some enemies can be a little spammy when it comes to the bow and if theres a lot of them you can get stuck in an endless loop of getting knocked down. Also a few of the unlockable characters that you can get have the same spells as others which is kind of a bummer. Still, dont let these two things prevent you from buying this, its very good."

[h1]Definitely A Classic[/h1]
If you haven't somehow played this one and are scanning the store page it may look like just another run of the mill beat-em-up but there are some really strong mechanics with this game. I grew up playing some of the classic titles such as golden axe, final fight, streets of rage, and many more. The fun thing is you go into google and type in classic beat em up games this title stands up right next to those games in the list of late 80s early 90s classics. The behemoth pretty much struck gold with this one. The humor is fantastic, the characters are diverse, the bosses are huge and every moment regardless of how many times you've gone through it is pretty much a treat to behold. There are weapons, characters, and pets to unlock each with different pros, cons, and abilities.  I've ran through this game multiple times on both xbox360 when I owned it and now on pc and it has never gotten old to me. The music is fantastic and an ear worm as well. I dare you to turn on that necromancer boss theme or the forest entrance music and not enjoy it.

[h1]The Minor Gripes[/h1]
This game is a classic and there isn't much wrong with it in my book. The only thing it suffers from is one of the cons of most multiplayer games. It's just not as fun by yourself. The difficulty can be hard to adjust to for new players and you're likely only going to find other people to play with on your own friends list since the game doesn't have an active online community anymore. If none of your friends somehow own it though you can always just dive into the forums and find someone willing to play a round.

[code]
[h1](っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ pros ♥[/h1]
+More than an on the surface beat em up
+Tons to unlock and find
+Great humor
+Awesome soundtrack

[h1](っ>▬<)っ x cons x[/h1]
-Inactive online community (best to play with own friends)
[/code]

If you haven't played this before and you enjoy beat em ups than this is a must buy. Honestly if you actively play it for a while the full price is worth it but you can pick it up much cheaper during a sale. Either way this one is pretty much a timeless classic worth the try.

The gameplay is amazing. You get so sucked into it and it's hard to stop playing. It's always ""ok one more level"". Even when things are really hard and you can't beat it, you feel like you need to beat it otherwise you feel incomplete. This game is 10x more fun playing with friends. The characters are awesome and the gameplay is hilarious. Immature, sure. But hilarious nonethe less

11386,Lots of fun and very simple. One of my favorites to play with friends.
11387,"Very fun with friends, a full party of 4 and you'll have a great time. Alone the game is still fun, but not nearly as much, as it is meant to be played with the full party of 4. There is some replay value, as you can unlock characters and there is also Insane Mode which also adds a bit of replay value.  Most of the characters are generally the same, but have enough differences to it feel worth playing all of them.  Overall fun game, really no complaints other than a lack of single player value"

""Earlier this month, Apple ended support for 32-bit Mac applications with the launch of macOS Catalina 10.15. This means that if you upgrade your macOS, you will be unable to use any 32-bit applications that you may have on your computer.

11431,Absolutely amazing game during boredom
11432,ye its alright
11433,Its so good it makes me HAPPY AS FUCK
11434,"This game, is amazing. I give it a 9/10.

[u][i][b]Story[/b][/i][/u]

In Castle Crashers, the kingdom's princesses have been kidnapped and you're the one chosen to save them. It's not exactly the best story ever, but it's still a solid 7/10 for me.

[u][i][b]Gameplay[/b][/i][/u]

The combat system could be better, but it doesn't ruin the experience. Playing with a controller is definitely better than playing with a keyboard and a mouse. Each time you beat the game, you unlock a new character, making you more intrigued to see what characters can be unlocked next. Each map is different, which in my opinion is one of the most important things in a video game like this.

The pets are each unique, having different powers in each of them. They are definitely helpful, and I recommend using them if you plan to play Castle Crashers. The bosses are great, each one is unique and different. On the final level, you [spoiler]complete a boss rush before destroying the final boss and it's phases.[/spoiler] It's amazing. There are also secret pets and items hidden in maps, so keep a lookout for things like that. The gameplay for me, is a 9/10.

[u][i][b]Characters[/b][/i][/u]

Each character has unique abilities, as a nice touch. Some characters are minions of bosses, such as the barbarian. I give the characters in Castle Crashers an 8.5/10.

[u][i][b]Bosses[/b][/i][/u]

Each boss has unique abilities and powers. Many can be a challenge, which is one of the key parts for me in a game. But, some can be quite easy. I give the bosses in Castle Crashers an 8/10."

11436,"It awesome 
"
11437,"I used to play this game on PS4, i decided to purchase it on PC. What I can say about my expirences with both versions is that they are the same, except for the fact that the PS4 version includes all of the DLC for free, while the PC version does not. But this game is a really good time killer and i would really reccomend that you play this game. Especially during Covid-19. This game is also not hard, but also skills to accompolish certain parts. The best part about this game is that you can play with your friends and have a good time with them. I really enjoyed playing this game with my friend and i'm trying to convince my other friends to play it."
11438,"Been playing since 2012 on the Xbox 360 and it's one of the best games I've ever played.  This is my 69 hour time played on pc celebration.  but seriously, 10/10 would recommend, and try insane mode.  Believe it or not, it's pretty insane."
11439,its awesome
11440,yes
11441,"I've known this game since it's came out, and it is the best game i've played honestly. The art is amazing, the music choice, the gameplay style is fun and satisfying, and so much more. It's almost like i've formed a bond with the game over the years that I have spent on it. The people are kind in the discord server, there are still people who play it, and you can never get bored of it for ages. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who likes fun gameplay style and cool art. Thank you to everyone who worked on this game! Dan Paladin, Emily F, Josh, KirkSicle, Mark Anthony, Mike, Patrick, Roxanne, And Tom Fulp."
11442,This is the cuphead that my people and I like to call Castle crashers tho.
11443,Great game. Incredible soundtrack and heaps to do after the main story since you get a new character every time you beat it with a different starting one.
11444,"cool, very nice"
11445,"This game, is incredible. It's amazing in multiplayer, but it's still really good in singleplayer. The story, despite there being very little of it, is funny, and watching the cutscenes is really fun. The controls too are done very well. Despite how complicated they might seem, I never accidentally did a move I didn't want to. The game's difficulty curve is a bit steep, but it never gets to the point that you need to grind for levels. I also reccomend playing this game with friends via Steam Remote Play, beacuse they work really well together.
Overall, this is a game that's well-deserving your money."

11493,"Castle Crashers is actually interesting to look at objectively.

On one hand it has fun visuals, appeasing comedy, and shallow attacks/upgrades to cash in on casual gamers - but has a rather steep learning curve and punishing enemies which will entice a hardcore audience.

Weirdly, I just don't think it works. For casual gamers there's simply sections of the game which won't be traversable without investing serious time to build on a skill-set they may otherwise lack. For 'more serious gamers' the lack of depth, combined with a grinding necessity, may bore. 

Simply put; the game is either too hard, or lacks depth. 

I'd accept a difficult game with more RPG elements, and I'd accept a game that was easy, but fun. Castle Crasher attempts to mesh both and what I've discovered is one audience is turned off by a punishing difficulty level, hidden amongst pretty colours, while another audience is likely not prepared to put in the effort for a game which requires such attentiveness, without really providing the character development structure to make the investment worthwhile.

That said - Castle Crashers is a staple. It's the crowning jewel of Behemoth, and Newgrounds, and to people like myself it represents the glory days of teenage internet usage. It's the manifestation of countless weekdays after school, and weekends, strolling the internet for flash games. This is the third platform I've owned the game on, and will likely not be the last. How could I not recommend this?

Even if you only give it a couple of hours before rage quitting."

11550,Reliving my childhood with this game and still love it
11551,"Castle Crashers is a fun coop action adventure game that's also quite hilarious. It's great to play both alone and with up to 3 other friends. There are a lot of different characters to unlock by beating the game, and with it's immense replay value, it never gets boring to replay the story. There's also arena mode with PvP and PvE (fighting waves of enemies). Overall, lots of mindless fun to be had."
11552,"In short, being overleveled while your friends suffer is the most fun afternoon somebody could imagine.

11560,I previously owned this masterpiece of a 2D Side-scroller on the Xbox 360. I spent many summers playing with all my friends and am happy to experience the same joy today. This is a timeless favorite that is meant to be enjoyed with everyone. Hands down a 10/10.
11561,Amazing game
11562,Even though this game is dead you can still have fun by yourself or find remnants of players that play this and have fun! 10/10.
11563,Fun with friends
11564,Super fun with friends!!
11565,A very nostalgic game. I remember playing this on the ps3 with my siblings
11566,NICE GAME
11567,"I had so much fun when I played Castle Crashers on the 360 and now that I have it on Steam I can bring back my childhood when I'm hit with the nostalgic memories. Overall give the game an 8.5 out of 10 for a simple game it does have a pretty big story and a wide selection of weapons while also having lots of pets, the game has you grind to get items you need to advance through the map. The game is just good, highly recommend it."
11568,"Loved it when I first played it on Xbox 360.  
Enjoyed it again when I played it on Xbox One.
Now thanks to it being on sale for $3 USD, I got to experience the fun and entertainment all over again with new friends on PC."
11569,it good
11570,Fun for a while until u beat it.
11571,"Its fun to play with friends but playing with more than two people adds a delay for some reason and it removes a lot of the fun
Playing alone gets rid of the delay but its not the same when your alone...."

11573,a
11574,amazing game
11575,Love the Game. Fun with friends. wish there was a part 2 for this.
11576,"Castle Crashers. A 2d rpg classic. It has been around ever since I was young. The first time I had ever played this game was on my xbox 360. I have loved it ever since. The dlc's are amazing with brand new features to make the game and they only cost $1 each! Its a steal. I personally got this game on sale for $3 but now since I have played it would have payed $30. This game has made my week. I recommend it if you are a player who likes playing hard games. Castle Crashers is very challenging even towards the start. But with enough determination this game will make your day. This game has fun little features throughout the way like a little dinosaur to run on, get shout out of a cannon, etc. If you like 2d cheap games here is one you will certainly enjoy. Thanks so much Castle Crashers for the great game and hope to see more games from you in the future. - Bluran"

11717,"Its been 2 years since i've played this game, i recently decided to come back and am happy i chose to do that. i used to play it on the xbox with my family and i had the time of my life, 100% recommended you play this."
11718,"A light RPG, hack and slash, that is perfect for couch coop with the significant other.  Me and my wife didn't much like the game at first.  We kind of slugged through it a couple of different evenings, until we got about half way through, then the game got better.  I think part of the fun was the humor in the game, but also getting our characters built up enough to take on some of the tougher guys. 

The game had one minor con, and that being how you pickup up Items and the Pets.  When you are near a new weapon or pet, you don't choose them, they choose you by being near them, ie proximity based.  Two problems with this is:  I accidentally walked past a pet I didn't want as I was leaving a room.  Too bad, you go back and your old pet is gone.  (I think I might have been able to get it again at another location but not confirmed).  Weapon swapping is time limited.  Eventually, either the new weapon or your old weapon will just vanish.  You have to make a fast decision, and if you accidentally pickup a weapon you don't want, you better fix it fast or you'll be stuck with something you don't want.

Got the game for $3, and felt like that was a good deal."

The game is one you can finish again and again with all the items that you have to find within the game. 

Very enjoyable game, well worth the money."

11725,"still an amazing game to this very day, especially with friends! there is a good reason it was ported to the PS4, Xbox one and Nintendo switch and that is because this game is a timeless classic that is still not only amazing, good for playing with friends/playing solo and being still worth the asking price, but it is also bound to bring amazing memories to those of which choose to play it."

11749,great storyline one of my favorite games of all time .
11750,Its a fun game but mostly fun if you have someone to play with
11751,"So good I had to buy it on Steam after originally playing it on PS3. Has that great classic side scrolling beat em up feel with a lot of humor and insane replayability. Fun to play alone and even better if you have someone to play with you. The level up system can take some getting used to since you gain 1 xp per hit, so putting points into speed first can help out a lot. There are so many different weapons, animal orbs, and characters to unlock, each with different abilities and styles, making this super fun to play over and over again. A must buy if you're a fan of classic beat em up type games!"
11752,"Its super fun, and awesome to play with friends"
11753,Very nice
11754,"I originally owned and played back in the XBOX360 days and still enjoy it til today. Fun playing with friends to be the best and to collect everything. Plenty of hours to put into the game because there is multiple characters to play & unlock between beating the game with a each character or DLC.

PRO : Great with Friends, Many Characters, Multi-Feature Game Modes, Single & Co-Op to 4, 


CON : Depending on your hands that you might need to have a controller to play for longer hours cause of control setup.

-Cant change control settings
-controls close on each other (big hands/fingers)"

All around incredible game, the only thing I wish for is higher resolution textures (although i completely understand that making such high resolution textures is pretty difficult, so i can't fault the game for this).

BUY THIS GAME! Even without a sale, it's well worth your money."

11794,Best game I've ever played. Played this bad boy back when it first came out for the xbox 360. Man were those the good old days. :D
11795,this is an addictive game
11796,"graphics:
8/10, the best 2d can get

gameplay:
forever, even if you beat the game you still have a ton of things to do, insane mode, unlock more characters and a lot more

multiplayer:
7/10, it could be out of sync because of one person having bad internet, cooperative gameplay so if you are lonely you can just join a server

price:
worth it

pay 2 win?
no, the only stuff in game you can buy is two characters that are not that op and only a dollar each

pc requirements:
i wouldn't really say potato but i would say low-end, i didnt see any lag what so ever on a mid-end pc

bugs:
not that many, the only bugs u can do is really tricky to do like go up the map or something but other than that i have seen no bugs

other: this game is amazing, i really like how all the characters are different and once you beat the game with a starting character, you get another character, if you beat it with that you get another. also i like how the game has many many arenas where you can challenge yourself to fight some pretty hard minions. but in return, you get the character you were facing against. i like how this game has enemy characters that you can be too with many secrets involved. one final thing the insane mode is insane, and it really is very very insane, but the reward if you beat a ton of levels like a cave, a boss and a castle you get a character for each one"

11804,This game is amazing fun and just a delight.
11805,It's a good way to connect with my family while far apart.
11806,pee
11807,"A personal favorite. One of the first Co-Op hack and slash games I've ever played.
There was nothing like staying up all night with some friends, eating junk food and finishing the game in one go.
Indescribable.

10/10 [Nostalgia biased included]

"
11808,"very fun game, nostalgic to say the least. Definitley something id play a lot as it states i played like 47 hours of it XD XD, but all in all its a 10/10 would reccomend for everybody"
11809,"Castle Crashers is a classic. Everybody should have it to play with friends! Although it does not have a particularly special storyline, all the rest, from the graphics to the soundtrack, is amazing! Fans of Hack&Slash, fans of indie game, people who like characters with unique special powers, people who like to play video games but are not necessarily good at it... Gather your friends and prepare to play a light and funny game with Castle Crashers."
11810,YES
11811,"This game, and ESPECIALLY its controls, have aged like milk. It feels like a half baked product now.

Seriously, Magic and USE ITEM for the quicker / weaker magic? What?

Also the combat feels reaaallly unbalanced. Even when you start out, you can just juggle your opponents until the cows come home and milk them for EXP. It almost feels like magic is useless anyways, especially with certain characters."
11812,i rate it alot of poo involved
11813,The games fun and you can't get bored. What else do you need in a game?
11814,Really fun. I like that its battle/fighting but also fun and not so serious.
11815,it good
11816,IT HAS AMAZING GRAPICS
11817,yes
11818,"super fun, especially with friends. rules and controls are easy and any progress you make on a character is saved no matter what mode youre in."
11819,great game
11820,"The art style is simple and there's no customization. The pets are cute. There are a lot of combinations of items, pets, and stats to choose from. The characters are all unique. The game is interesting if you have friends to play with.

My overall experience with this game was positive as I played it with my boyfriend and it was fun to fight for who gets to kiss the princess."
11821,awesome
11822,Fun Until Your Friend Beats You And Makes Out With The Princess

"
11826,"fun with friends, sad alone  =("
11827,"its good, but once you beat it the first time, it kinda loses its magic. i'd love to see some sort of dlc for this game. I would still recommend this game because its really fun to play with friends."
11828,
11829,"This game is quite fun, although half the time its about not stealing money and where to go, the game play is awesome and the characters and actions are funny."
11830,A amazing game with great grafics amazing gameplay a funny and cool story and great devs
11831,fun to play with friends =)
11832,"I played this game so much on my Xbox, to the point where I got every single playable character. However, the game is still so much fun. The replay value is wonderful, and the art is fantastic. One of the most worth it games on steam, in my opinion!"
11833,s
11834,"Portuguese: O jogo é ótimo, muitos personagens, ataques legais, gráficos bonitos, bosses variados, é muito balanceado, multiplayer é muito legal e divertido, a história é confusa ja que não ah uma. (caso alguém queira jogar comigo fala ai)

English: The game is great, lots of characters, cool attacks, beautiful graphics, varied bosses, it is very balanced, multiplayer is really cool and fun, the story is confusing since not one ah. (if someone wants to play with me, say it)"
11835,i love this game
11836,"I just beat this game and, excuse my language, HOLY SH*T! THIS GAME IS AMAZING! There's so much replayability, with so many characters to unlock! Buy this game and play it, it's worth the money, there are so many things to do. When you beat the game as a character, you even have the option to play insane mode. I haven't gotten around to it yet, but I'm definitely gonna do it sooner or later."
11837,This video game makes my pp tingle
11838,Afk for most of the 6 hours but fun anyway
11839,amazing game I used to watch as kid in 2013. Its amazing.

(even if i said all of that this game still is the best for how old it is and i cant stop)"
11844,Nice hack and slash that's fun to play with friends. Can easily dump 40+ hours into it.

11847,very fun to play
11848,"I do not write reviews for video games, but this one is quite special. I have replayed this game a dozen times, and each time I revisit the cold depths of Castle Crasher's oceans, I feel a sense of revamped adventure that I can't describe, and no other game can pull out of me. Experience this game in its entirety, every nook a cranny has something beautiful within it.

11859,Listen I used to play this game on the Xbox 360 and it was insane but let me tell you something this game isn't that long but you can get different characters every time you beat the game and the satisfaction of beating players to a pulp is so satisfying so I definitely recommend this game to people who don't really care about graphics and want a really fun and kind of comedic game
11860,Everything in this game is SOOOOOO AWESOME! The art style is goofy and bright. The controls are just right.

11871,"I've played this game for hundreds of hours on the Xbox 360, and it is perfect. Great button masher, perfect with friends, the art style is childish but nostalgic, and the overall gameplay is enjoyable and has amazing replayability. 20/10 worth every penny."
11872,"I played this game back on the xbox 360 constantly for years. Just this year I picked it up on steam to revisit it. Still great. I've played through the game more times than I can count, yet it is still fun. Do yourself a favor and pick it up. I got it for three bucks on sale."

11890,"This game is old but it could of come out yesterday. 
I loved playing it years ago on ps plus for ps3 and its stil funny, easy to control and entertaining. 
Great solo or with up to four friends. 
Only one small critique, the default controls are wack and it takes a small while to fix them, like the main attack it w and you move around with arrow keys. Ive changed most of them but some buttons cannot be fixed and its annoying to reach for the arrow keys in stats mode. 
Despite this it is literally my fav game ever, it was on my wishlist for ages until sale and my avatar was this character before my purchase. 
Best game ive ever played.

11934,"[h1] Castle Crashers [/h1]
[i] An absolute adventure [/i]

[b]    Castle Crashers [/b] is a beat-em-up game that will surely take your time up. I used to play it a lot on my Xbox 360, however I do not have it with me anymore. So, I've decided to buy the Steam Version. I am amazed.
         This game is literally all I remember it to be. Great. Fun. Please buy this amazing game. The Behemoth are amazing developers. I'm not spoiling anything about the game's story (I just got this game and I forgot the original story line so I wouldn't even care) or anything about the bosses, but it sure is one heck of a ride.

[h1] Comparisons [/h1]
    As you might know already, this game has 2 versions; the original version and the remastered version. Currently, the original version is supported on PS3 and the XBOX 360. The remastered version is supported with Steam/PC, PS4, and the XBOX One. 
    Here are the differences from the Remastered and the Original (not everything is listed, just everything  I know) (R = Remastered, O = Original)
[list]
[*]R has more quality than O (in terms of Frames per Second and resolution
[*]O has All You Can Quaff whilst R doesn't, but it was replaced with the Barbarian game mode
[*] Literally all I know lol
[/list]
     Yeah I don't know much, but anyways, moving on...
[h1] Pros & Cons [/h1]
Cons

[list]
[*]Doesn't have All You Can Quaff :(
[*]Might crash on some computers (online mode)
[*]Game is dead
[*]Randomly exits you out of the round your playing in (online mode)
[*]Pink & Purple is DLC but it's like 1 dollar so
[/list]
Pros

[list]
[*]HD
[*]Can run well on bad computers
[*]Engaging story line
[*]Humor scenes
[*]The animations crack me up hard such as the popped out eyes and the (spoiler) [spoiler] Trolls die... disgustingly  and the animals shit themselves when they hear the giant ass troll boss and some of the designs are funny [/spoiler]
[*]Minigames that differ from the other story
[*]Online mode
[*]You can play with up to 4 people including steam friends
[*]Amazing combo system
[*]Different gameplay styles, hundreds of weapons 
[*]Pets
[*]Hard mode
[*]Ultra quality gamer HD mode
[*]It's on fucking sale [October Halloween sale so its probably ended by now
[*]Alien hominid and battleblock theater references
[*]Theres a mofo sandwich that makes u buff

11940,This is an amazing game no more than 20 bucks even with the dlc's which compared to other games that is cheap. You can play with friends or random people. Only a max of 4 people at a time though. You can adventure with your friends or alone in the adventure mode. Kill your friends in arena or bots. Run from barbarians in the 3rd mode i forgot the name with or without your friends. All these game modes can also be played with randoms too. Have fun =)

"
12021,very nice
12022,"This game was basically my childhood. I love this game, but there are pros and cons about the game. Lets start with the cons, and get those out of the way.
Cons: 
This game has a few glitches, none too bad, and I am sure I have not discovered them all. 
Sure there are lots of characters, but those characters lacked in having different animations such as the Skeleton and the Cultist or the Peasant and the Conehead.
The game is incredibly short to me, in which I speedrun it in under 2 hours,  but there is an insane mode which is moderately difficult.
This game can be fun without friends, but most of the time it isn't
Yes this game is around the world but when i join lobbies, they are way too laggy.
This may not be a con, just a warning, if you are playing insane mode be careful about the bombs, they are thrown way too frequently.

Now for the pros
Pros: 
play it coz yes. You will enjoy it with friends coz yes"
12023,"a relic from better days . good all around fun  with plenty of hidden secrets and items to find and use, with a easy to play level system , since its original creation on new grounds to its port to x-box and now steam Castle crashers still holds its own after all these years"

12041,"An absolutely wonderful game. I play it all the time and insane mode is a really fun challenge. My only issue is that there are lots of bugs and glitches. Otherwise, it's fantastic."
12042,"You play as a rambunctious bunch of neerdowells that ruin a poor mans wedding, kill him, kill his friend, then fight the wizard of the west at the end of the yellow brick road."
12043,cool lots of charters
12044,"Fun game to play along friends virtually, specially during Covid-19. It took us around 9 hours to finish its campaign mode, but there's more content to unlock (as new characters / weapons) so we could play a bit more if we want to."

12046,"Very fun experience, solo or with friends. Surprisingly fluid and fun combat, with replay value built in."
12047,Peepee
12048,"chill to play in a group and pretty fast to beat, though the combat can get kinda spammy :p"
12049,the game is super well made with plenty of fun features and secrets
12050,"Almost infinite replay value, fun and easy combat system, and unforgettable bosses (especially the cyclops and his bestie.) A game for the ages that i enjoy even today, 10 years later."

12059,I got fucking trolled.
12060,"I remember this game being loads of fun when I was younger. I think the nostalgia got to me. Playing it now, it is very clunky. You get hit when you shouldnt, things like that. A remastered version of this game would be great for it."
12061,"good game. Arcade style, duh. Enjoyable gameplay"

12070,Let's go back to 2008 Newgrounds!
12071,"epic
like me"
12072,CASTLE CRASHERS
12073,"Fun game with a lot of challenge to it (at least if you play it solo), even if some things can get annoying, like enemies being able to smack you to the ground as soon as you get up from being smacked.

Upgrade system is nice with how you can basically customize the play style you wanna go with while you go through the game. Plenty of playable characters even though the only main difference is what magic they can use. Lots of weapons and pets you can get to fit a variety of who wants to play what way. Overall, very fun.

My only issue is in Intense mode where the stages are insanely hard where as bosses aren't even much of a challenge. They are harder than the main game, but I only take around 80-100 damage when hit by a boss whereas normal stage enemies deal 300 damage in a single hit."
12074,game suck
12075,play with friends
12076,This game is what for honour should have been
12077,great fun. 8/10
12078,"Castle Crashers stands as one of the classic indie games that became larger than life, like Minecraft and Terraria. It's the definitive fun and goofy game that you can play with your friends, and trust me, it is always a hoot to play this with your friends. There are tons of unlockable characters and surprisingly fun and engrossing locations to conquer. If you have no friends and are looking for the next challenge from a video game, Castle Crashers has got that also. It's new game + can be incredibly difficult even with the most overpowered Crashers at your disposal. I only managed to beat new game + cooperatively with my friends, not alone. I recommend this game for all ages and it is without a doubt a must have for anyone looking for an unforgettable time."

12126,"If you have friends to play with, this game is an absolute blast!"
12127,"This game is a clear example of a dev team that instead of just jumping on the next sub-genre bandwagon, they clearly spent time studying and reinventing what makes it great in the first place. Ring of Pain could have easily been just another rip-off of Slay the Spire, but the game tells its own dark and cryptic story with some very unique mechanics. Late game challenges end up funneling the player towards some specific powerful combos, so I would really like to see more content added in future updates. Art style is unique and menacingly beautiful. Story is just cryptic enough to make you want to dive back in and see more endings. All-in-all, it is totally worth your time and money."
12128,Fun hack and slash game to play solo or with friends!
12129,Great to play with friends
12130,its fun
12131,"This game is soooo good, I got in to it while playing it with my cousin and installed it at home. I maybe played the demo for a month but bought the whole game without knowing it but my dad found out but I was maybe 7 or 8 years old when I bought it so I did not get grounded. I was playing it on a XBOX 360. I rate it 9 out of 10!"
12132,This game is so much fun to play with friends me and my friend played through the whole game in about 5 hours yet there is so much to do still this game is amazing.

12156,SO goooddddd
12157,really brings back the memories of playing this game on xbox 360 and my friend who missed the pre cambrian update who still lives in the ocean had fucking dial up or something so the game kept stopping so that his mud hut internet could catch up so we could continue playing the game also please make castle crashers 2 i will literally give the devs a blowie if they do

"
12175,very cool

Ever since I got my Xbox 360, this was one of the first games I got, I didn't play for a bit, but when I got around to it, I didn't regret it... This game has amazing music, teamwork, fighting, and world. I love the bosses, the skills, and the amount of original weapons and pets.

I would recommend this to almost anyone."

12244,"I've been playing this game for a long long time on different devices/consoles, and no matter what console your playing on, this game is something to behold."
12245,Yes.

Starts easy, and slowly builds in difficulty well scaled, and if you felt like it was easy overall, a ruthless insane mode can be played on completion.  Worth the buy."

Even tho the game hasn't been upadted in years its still very fun to play & you can harldy ever get bored. Its also fun to collect the pets & diffrent weapons.

12329,"Nostalgia at it's finest. I played this game a lot with my friends from Elementary school, and we sunk countless hours into this simple Hack and Slash newgrounds game. Defeating the bosses and just enjoying the gameplay, figuring out secrets and looking out for new things to discover. Get new weaponry, level your character, and just have mindless fun with a challenge"
12330,Nostalgia and still hecking fun. Normal Knight is good trust me.
12331,nice game
12332,"Is good, lot of goofs and gaffs and secks"
12333,good
12334,I can shoot out rainbows and fight giant cats with furballs. This game is perfection.
12335,"I remember I used to play this game several years ago on the xbox. I had a maxed out red knight and was able to defeat any boss with ease (and somehow glitched my character to unlock every location when I hadn't discovered them all.) I made a few friends playing the game online, too; overall it was a fun experience and I loved it so much!

The graphics are amazing, the art style is incredible and nostalgic, and the character unlock/selection is full of diversity. I love the music, and the various ways you can play your characters. Not to mention, the game is fairly easy to learn, and the story and ending are wonderful!

When playing this game on Steam, I remembered every location, almost all secret items, how to correctly complete puzzles, and how to beat every boss. I also don't recall any bugs during my adventures, and it's fairly easy to run on my trash laptop!

I still love every second of playing this game, Castle Crashers will remain one of my favourites for all-time!"

12343,"Castle crashers is and always will be one of my all-time favorite games on steam, with over 170 hours on this game, it never got old. On the surface this seems like a funny beat em game with elements of an rpg that you can play with 3 other friends for a bit of casual fun, but castle crashers is way more than that. It has a surprising amount of replayability, with 31 characters to play around and mess with, 29 pets (animal orbs) to add bonuses to your characters and a massive 80 weapons to use with your character. With this amount of customization you can really make your own knight stand out from the rest, there is plenty to work towards in this game with the afforementioned characters, weapons and animal orbs, it could satisfy any player, even for a single playthrough of the game. I would reccomend this game 100%Especially when you have friends or siblings to play with, because that is when the game gets really good. Even if you have no friends I still would highly reccomend this game, as there is plenty of fun to be had with it"
12344,fun with friends
12345,this is a old game yes but is still one of my favourite multiplayer games out there and if you and your friends are yet to play this game then i incourage you to buy it and play it
12346,"Gentlemen, you crash castles simple, cool killing game but not for girls or children. Please take that into account while playing."

With a simple rpg leveling system and weapon selection, the game will require a little grinding here and there to gain enough levels to easily plow through the game, but because its coop it never feels like the gameplay gets old. 5/5"

Graphics, Cartoonish yet very well detailed. Story, Magic rock of whiteness gets stolen by some nerd who was laughed at in school. Go here, kill this dude who probably didn't do anything wrong, kiss princess, have princess stolen potentially by some other dude kill him, Get laughed at for not being buff and go see a psychologist. travel across the ocean and be in Asia for five seconds. go on a trip of seeing aliens and playing volleyball. Reach gate where crazy snake lady lives and execute her. Go to the next section where you get bullied by some guy throwing rocks at you. Defeat the Frost Guy (Make sure to hit him a few more times). Go to final scene and be sad that you can't fly and get hit by a rock and die.

12424,"mmmmmmmMMMMMM I HAVE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THIS GAME

OKAY SO. Number one.
This is actually maybe my favorite game of all time. There will never be a time when I will reject a request to play Castle Crashers, whether it be on Steam or on an old and beat-up Xbox 360. True quality doesn't come from advanced graphics 'n shit like that, it comes from Gameplay and Story. I was RAISED on this game, and it was the very beginning of my gaming career right next to big titles like Minecraft.

While the Story is a bit surface-level, the Gameplay is what makes this game so satisfying. Each slash and hit makes you feel like you're really making a difference, and when you get knocked down you feel amped to get back into the fight, more determined than ever before. The controls on, well, controller, play incredibly well and are highly suggested even if you're not that good with a controller in the first place. 

The story itself is certainly strange, but I think that's what I love about this world so much. Oh, hey, a dinosaur with a saddle! Looks fun! Now you're running from a horrifying eldritch creature black as night with claws as big as tree-trunks while riding with a pack of deer. Oh and now you're flying down a river fighting a giant, LITERAL cat-fish named Mittens. Oh hey, bats! Wait, weren't we supposed to be doing something?

The creative directions this game takes are honestly so unorthodox that it just makes me laugh. It's genuinely incredible, and absolutely wonderful because the game NEVER feels the same when you're playing different levels. Every detail was hand-crafted, baked to perfection and we get to play the results. Each area of the map feels like an entirely new world, and it is greatly satisfying to discover new places and uncover secrets. The comedic element to this game makes it great too, like the cat stuck in the ceiling at the Pet-Ark. 

My only complaint is that you can't jump on peoples' heads. Other than that, this game is a solid 11.5/10 and I would say this game is worth three times as much as it currently is."
12425,get this game because this is a good game speed freaks play this game play it now
12426,is very cool and good
12427,beautiful
12428,Lulu bought me this game and promised we'd finish it. Never finished it with her.

12430,been one of my favorite games since i was a kid and it still is
12431,Good game. If you like to 100% games this game is worth 20$ but if you don't like completing games to its fullest I would wait for the game to go on sale.

12455,its a good game and its old the games today are crap
12456,"Honestly a CLASSIC, I always come back to this game with the boys. Honestly for the age its still a quality game, with a funny plot. After completing the game there are new characters you can unlock, up to 31 characters. So there's going to be 31 runs on this game, good luck. You'll have at least 5+ hours worth of gameplay. I HIGHLY recommend playing with friends."

12469,small men hit other small men big yes
12470,"I've had a copy of this game on Steam for ages, but never got around to playing it until now. Today, on impulse, I decided to load it back up, since I had such fond memories of playing it with my family as a kid. While it's not as easy to play alone, it's still exactly as I remember it. I love it to death.
My one bit of advice, though? Play with a gamepad. The startup screen isn't kidding when it says they recommend it. It's noticeably more difficult to play with a keyboard."
12471,its fun
12472,"This game has about 12 hours of campaign (at a low skill level) , even though im not the greatest at it, its still super fun, will keep playing even though I beat it."

12486,"Castle Crashers was originally a console exclusive indie Beat’em up game but now it's available on Steam alongside its DLC, and I gotta say: this game is amazing!
It is one of the best indie games ever made hands down. It has it all: an excellent fluid gameplay that stands up to multiple playthroughs, lot of humor added to the blood and gore, a decent difficulty, beautiful graphics with amazing animations and a rich diversity of worlds. And it is INCREDIBLY CHEAP. 
Now that's what an indie game should be. The game is not only fun but it also provides a great multiplayer experience up to 4 players who can engage in the main campaign which comes in two difficulty flavors or duke it out in a arena type PVP style mode. The fact that this games proposes online AND local multiplayer sweetened the deal for me."
12487,"absolute banger of a co-op adventure with lots of replayability with the new characters, pets, and weapons you unlock, as well as how you choose to level your character"
12488,"A relic of a byegone age, Castle Crashers is slow by modern standards but is still a fun little romp with lots of creativity and one of the best soundtracks in any game ever."

12505,"lovly
"
12506,"I know this game is considered a bit of a party-game classic, but I struggled to make it work. There was ridiculous delay on all of my input commands: I'd click a key to move or attack, and about a full second later the character would act. This was my only really big problem, but honestly it killed the game for me. I wasn't competitive or helpful to my friends because I was constantly unable to respond to the rapidly changing situation, and I was unable to defend myself properly. I also couldn't compete for any resources or fight well in PvP as a result.

I rate Castle Crashers a 2/5: a niche or below average purchase. For me, it was just straight up below average: having an unresponsive game is not fun. I imagine it's fun If you can get it to work for you; keep an eye on performance and refund the game if you're having trouble and can't fix it."
12507,"Easily the game with the best replay value, I have just as much fun playing the storymode now as I did on my first playthrough"
12508,is game
12509,"Amazing soundtrack, nice gameplay (though sometimes frustrating), funny cinematics and story. Highly recommended!"
12510,"this game has a good list for its soundtrack, my favorite music is the necromancer theme or even Dark Skies. the gameplay wise, its bad. I hate the people versus people on this game, it takes no skill and its very hard to break out of a juggle. all you do is spam or trap someone with a overpowered spell with said character. a other stupid feature is that you have everyone control on when ever they want to go on the map, even when you're the host of the game. it makes no sense, the online has a lag issue even when i am using 5G from optimum on a full bar. some of the pets have a mind of their own, sometimes they will attack or other times do nothing at all. i first started playing this on xbox 360 which was years ago, it was oh ok for certain parts of the game but gets really aggravating. the controls are not hard to master but the hit detection is off too, trying to juggle you have to be in a certain spot to keep the movement going or else you'll mess up on what you're doing. I would not recommend it."

It has a lot of replay-ability, fun and fluid gameplay, as well as a very high skill ceiling. This game will hopefully keep you hooked for a long time, and in my case, it was well worth the money."

12596,"-) A lot of toilet humor (owl poops herself to death or the deer that runs along the screen while defecating).

-) Unfair fights - you are attacked melee and being bow-shot from the back.

-) Cheering audience that will block the game view on the boss.

-) Annoying unskippable cutscenes (When the enemies are shown carrying the princesses 
between the level`s stages. I got it - they were kidnapped.)

12610,"[b] [h1] Castle Crashers [/h1] [/b]

Since Castle Crashers is a game that lies on the simpler side, I will not be delving into my usual, more complex review. I'll just get straight to the point.

[b] [h1] The Good [/h1] [/b]

[*] [b] The Gameplay [/b]

- Castle Crashers is a fairly straightforward and simplistic game. You pick your character, and you start the story. You travel to each individual mission on a map and play through it. It is in a 2D, side-scroller format which allows gameplay to literally just be ""move forward"", not to imply its just that though. It has a good amount of depth to the story, and has interesting and entertaining characters. 

[*] [b] The Characters [/b]

- Playable or not, the characters in castle Crashers are very fun. The story characters add a sense of depth and personality that many side-scrollers lack and make you actually able to enjoy the story. The playable characters share that same boat of depth and personality. Each PC has a different, unique power they can use along with their look and playstyle. Some like to shoot arrows and heal the team, some like to run in with a battleaxe, and others like to hurl lightning bolts and rain fire. Play how you want

[*] [b] The Looks [/b]

- For a side-scroller, it looks great. A colorful, detailed, and entertaining art-style keeps you immersed yet amused and a flawless animation style keep you enthralled with the game. Much more effort than expected from a small game

[*] [b] The multiplayer [/b] 

- Its waaaaaaaay better with friends. Just saying. Makes the gameplay much more chaotic and varied

[*] [b] The Worth [/b]

- Honestly, its a steal. If you're into this style of game, its a very cheap buy that will reward you with hours of fun and entertainment. Its definitely worth the couple of bucks

[b] [h1] The Bad [/h1]  [/b]

[*] [b] The Replayability [/b] 

- This is truly the only downside to this game that I noticed. It also only will be a problem if you feel the same as I do. As much fun as this game is, its a lot of the same stuff, just recycled. Its fun to play once but not much fun go again, at least by yourself. If you're introducing a friend to the game its more fun.

[b] [h1] Overall [/h1]  [/b]

Castle Crashers is an amazing game. It is extremely entertaining, holds it's own, and provides you with hours of fun. Its even more fun with friends. Its a cheap buy and you get much more than your money's worth out of it."
12611,Some good mindless button-mashing fun enhanced by the company of friends.
12612,Good Game For 1 - 4 Ppl to play if bored and u want smth challenging
12613,.
12614,i played this on xbox and now that i own it on pc i can waste my life again
12615,"Price;  Just right

12622,eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
12623,"Back in high school, me and my friends played this game night after night on my Xbox. It is fantastic game to play with friends, and if you don't have any of those, it is still fun solo as well! A goofy side scrolling game and lots of characters to unlock!"
12624,good
12625,lol
12626,"Fun, hilarious, and enjoyable."

Edit; Game Audio Fixed
After a quick search on youtube I found that the audio won't work without DirectX installed."
12648,"Great game i recomend to play with friends but it is more challenging to play solo. So if you enjoy a challenge play solo, or if you enjoy just having fun with your friends then play multiplayer."
12649,"The brutal creativity makes it funny, fast, and rewarding."
12650,very fun! i can relive my xbox 360 days.

12709,"Bought this because of positive reviews, turn out it‘s not that good. Online search for team mate never works, so I could only play by myself and each session last no more than 5 mins, feels like chores and boring."
12710,h
12711,Very very gut
12712,"Bela arte cartunizada que continua belíssima apesar dos anos q se passaram. Jogabilidade ótima, dificuldade normal, as arenas são desafiadoras e são opcionais, oq na minha opinião são pontos positivos. História excelente. Um jogo que leva muito a sério o fato de que não se leva a sério: como os jogos mais divertidos e de personalidade mais marcante o são."
12713,YES
12714,"By and FAR the best slasher game I have ever bought. If you're on the fence about this game, wait till a sale and pick this up for 3 bucks or whatever and find out why yourself."
12715,"best game ever, so much fun"
12716,its very good!!!!!!!!!!
12717,"Just a fun game to chill out and play and not feel pressured into being great at it

"
12718,"  This game is both a tribute to early aughts Newgrounds and '90s arcade beat 'em ups. Whenever I have company and want to introduce an easy co-op game with friends or family, this is one of my first choices.  ""Just keep hitting 'X' and you'll do fine!"" 
  They might not get the same jokes or references you do, but that's fine. Just play through the first 4 or so levels with them, and they'll have a blast. The game is both cute and violent, so everyone is happy. Then when you send your company home, you'll find a great mind eraser for yourself. 
  There's tons of characters to unlock, ridiculous weapons to collect (like a giant stalk of broccoli, a frozen fish, a newgrounds lollypop etc) and cute animals to collect. Each of these things will determine your character's loadout and performance in battle. Do you go for the pure power weapon and the strength boosting animal? Or do you go for a magical weapon and a animal that shoots fire along side you?
  I suppose technically you can beat the game in an afternoon. But so what? All good beat 'em ups should be able to be beaten in a marathon session with your best friend. And this game is no exception. And if your friends cancels on you, you can always play online with strangers!"
12719,so much fun with friends
12720,do a combo and the enemy stays in the air for the rest of their life
12721,GOOD
12722, m.
12723,"Nice beat up game! Awesome to play with friends! Lots of unlockable and chars to level.

So why the thumbs down?

Simple, the difficulty step is very, VERY bad balanced, with lvl 30 you destroy enemies in normal, in insane you take arrows and explosions  that destroys you, and you have to keep beat a single enemy literally to the point of exaustion... my thumb was hurting to press attack repeatedly.

Really a shame, such a great game..."
12724,real fun and simple.
12725,"Fantastic game, super fun for co-op play, my only gripe is that I wish there was more. I played it with a friend of mine, and we beat it quite quick."
12726,fun
12727,"this was one of my first game's and I have only good memories of this fun and wacky world.
for playing I would suggest multiplayer i remember playing it with my dad and 2 brothers and it makes it so much better.
if you ever want a game to play alone or with friends that isn't to hard and a hella ton of fun than play this."
12728,"the best game ever buy it
after a lot of time... its still the best game over"
12729,its good get it
12730,good game and even better with battleblock theter

12775,"Recommended for anyone wanting a beat-em-up, couch co-op, or a pick up and play game.

I had Castle Crashers for the Xbox Live and bought it again on Steam if that doesn't show how much fun I had with the game.  The game packs so much content and reasons to replay the same areas again.  

The only downside is some of the low brow humor which wears off fast.  I would have been just fine with its identity just from the lovely artwork and animations."
12776,one of the best indie games ever made
12777,"Played Castle Crashers for the first time in 2008 and I can happily say it still holds up. I introduced this game to 2 friends and we all played together, which was a lot of fun. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Gory side-scrolling violent game with weird but enjoyable humor."
12778,"It's one of the best arcade games out there. 
The humor is really good."

12786,good
12787,"Outstanding game.
The Reminded me the nostalgic game ""Golden Axe"".
But it was better, never stumbled upon a game that made me finish it 30 times on every difficulty, with every character, unlocking every weapon and pet, finish all the arenas and way more.
The game achieves perfection with his childish humor that lands every time. Great music, and addictive ""Easy to learn hard to master gameplay"".
Can't do enough justice for this game with a review. 
I can however recommend you to play it and see for yourself what it is all about.
Because it was just a lovely experience."

12793,"Castle Crashers is just a breath of fresh air, a game thats over 11 year old is still fun to this day. This game is one of the best games to pick up a buddy and play. My only issues are the gameplay can get a little repetitive when you have to beat the same story and levels over again when playing as a new character but this isn't a huge issue. Alot of the characters are very unique with all of their abilities but some are identical to others the only difference being the starting weapon, but this is a minor complaint. Overall Castle Crashers is a very unique and fun game
solid 8/10"
12794,Gud game
12795,"I loved this game, it has good gameplay while still being absolutely adorable at everytime. I also loved the collecting involved in this game, they were cute but also useful. (The giraffe being the best ofc) My bf and I spent many hours playing this game, it's a great co-op game."

Gameplay is quite simple, it is nothing more then smash mouse button left or right. 

It doen'st make the game less fun, because it contains quite a lot of humor. 

I would recommend this game if you'r into all this.

12847,Good game but their is one glitch of my knowing. (i did not say what it is so you won't use it.)
12848,"Bring me back to the old Xbox 360 days baby. There is so much packed into Castle Crashers. Different characters, weapons, pets, enemies, bosses, and more. You got strength, defense, magic, and agility to level up. Each character has different magic abilities. Oh man this game is great. Bullet points for those who cannot read are below.


--Positives

--Length of the game is perfect

--Variety of different characters, weapons, and pets to collect and choose from

--Challenging

--Abundance of different enemies and levels types

--Replay value


--Negatives

--In later levels it can be somewhat of a grind


If you enjoy collecting things and unlocking new characters this is the game for you. Unlocking new characters to test out the different magic abilities they all use is so much fun. Very comical game. Fun with friends as well. What I also love is that it is the length of the game is perfect. Not too short or long. Also, this game has a bunch of replay value. This is a 9/10. Buy this game. You will not regret it."
12849,yes
12850,"Castle crashers must've never got the memo of ""Bros before Hoes""

10/10 Great game"
12851,Fun
12852,"Very fun game. Has many different challenges and things to unlock or progress towards even after completing your first run through. Doesn't require a lot of space or CPU processing power, either. Kids can play as well as adults. Great cooperative game."

12859,This game/company is amazing and you should play everything they have (except for maybe the first alien hominid I didn't like it too much). Enough good has been said about this game but I figure I'd write at least one review on steam

12876,"Ridiculously fun time-wasting game. Reminds me of when i was younger, 9/10"
12877,"good,y eha"
12878,"I think it's a nice game. Much better with friends and remote play together on this game was a great feature.

As for achievements, there are a few hard ones to get. There is one where you need to win 40 online matches (no one plays anymore) and one where you need 2:30 on Back Off Barbarian (almost impossible unless you have 3 other online players and do a glitch).

Overall, the story was simple, fairly easy, and i wish it had a more challenging story. The graphics were decent and gameplay was smooth. I recommend this game if you have a friend who would play this with you because it'll make the experience much better."
12879,Nice game for party of friends!
12880,"AMAZING
"
12881,princess was beast
12882,"Amazing beat-'em-up. There's nothing more fun than infinitely juggling enemies across the screen, then throwing them against a wall into another infinite air-juggling combo."
12883,"Castle Crashers was the very fist indie game I ever played back in 2009, and now today it's my third favorite game of all time. The art style is simple yet amazingly drawn and the gameplay whilst also being simple is also an amazing 2D beat 'em up, the music is super nostalgic and fun.

Now me calling this game simple isn't an insult, I see it as more of a complement. Castle Crashers is easy for newcomers to the game and it's also brutal to the player at some points especially on insane mode. Also with the game being published in 2008 there's bound to be some issues, seeing how with after every new release of the game it mainly gets graphical and minor gameplay enhancements, It can be a bit buggy at times but its nowhere close to being unplayable.

This game is very special to me because I've been playing it since 2009 and it's the only game I own on four systems, the PS3, PS4, PC/Steam, and Nintendo Switch. I personally love this game and I bet you will as well."

12891,pretty good
12892,"This is a game you can enjoy by playing alone or with friends, although is much more fun if you can gather 3 friends to help you finish it.
The posibility of unlock new characters and find hidden weapons gives you a ton of extra hours. And if you want a real challenge, the Insane Mode is just what you need."
12893,amazing.
12894,My 6-year old son and i love playing this game together.  Great for kids. All the neighbours kids will love you and your kid will be popular if you let them play this game.

12897,its good get it now
12898,"its an amazing game in almost every way, probably the thing that i don't like the most is that you can't change character withought replaying the game, also it's very hard to remember how to do combos"
12899,This game is awesome. Endless fun.
12900,i didnt play this for long but its a fun game to play with friends and all the friends i played with have a lot more play time and they really enjoy it i bought it on sale so im a bit biased so if i were you you should also wait for it to go on sale because itll only cost 5 bucks and why not get it for 5 bucks.
12901,gud 2013
12902,AO FUN
12903,"Great Game Overall. Brings back many memories of when it first came out on playstation/xbox. First playthrough is by far the best, but the replay value is still decent with the different build paths, weapons, and animal orbs. Really fun to try to unlock every character. Insane mode is really hard but lots of fun with friends. There's no way I could beat it solo, which brings me to the one complaint I have about this game - Potions are not automatically used when you are solo, but they are with multiple people. This still makes no sense at all to me, but it's still a great game."
12904,"Bom jogo, poderia ter a história maior"

12910,"This game is funny but it is sexist because you save princess then you figth and only the strongest get the girl , it is a machist ol way of competition. We though man were more evolve but i guess not, could we have a version with prince for gender equiality this way, both gender ar stupid and barbaric so that okay (actually its not but its better than nothing)"
12911,well done

12933,This is one of my personal top 10 games of all time. I played it for 100's of hours on xbox 360 and some on xbox one before getting it on pc. Not a single second of time I played in this game was wasted time. It is a timeless classic and no matter how long i haven't played it for it will always be fun when I do.

12950,"grab your ""friends"" and fight the hordes of enemies, with mandatory brakes for humor, the weapons don't upgrade, YOU upgrade, and find/ buy new weapons and floating animals to enhance your game play how you see fit. I suggest buying BattleBlock Theater allong side this game to unlock Hatty and his golden whale that poops Gold, **be sure to hang arround the room after the bug bat (after collecting the treasure of course) with the whale for an other funny bit. :)"
12951,its the best indie game on steam in my opion plz support tom flup and the blemonth
12952,"Truly a magnificent game, I loved every moment of playing this with my friends.

There was times that we fell out because I picked the green knight and kept killing him in the dual arena. Most notably, him telling me to ""go die in a hole"", I still haven't found the right hole to end my life in yet. The most favoured time was when he finally beat me at winning over a princess... To find the best joke ever, it was perfect timing, and I dont think that I could ever recreate the same laugh I made when I saw this the first time.

There was also times when we would fight over the pet that we would use, for example, the infamous rule of ""No Giraffe""*

I would 100% recommend this to anyone that is looking for a game to play with their friends, its a relatively good pick up and play game. However, the enemy spam can be quite rage inducing sometimes.

*The Giraffe is a pet that you can find in the game that follows you around, there are many pets for you to use, each giving the player unique bonuses. The giraffe, in particular, gives the player bonus XP and therefore allows the person to level up faster than others in the lobby. At the end of each boss level, you must fight your friends to win the princess. Obviously the higher the level you are compared to your friend, the better chance you have of winning. Hence, the rule to ban the Giraffe (However, we always tried to sneak it into our pet slot if we could)"
12953,"The game is worth it. It is fun and while short and sometimes frustrating, it is a game that I believe evetybody should at least try."
12954,its okay i suppose
12955,you're crashing castles whats not to love
12956,Yeah it pretty good. It even better if you have friend

12972,Very good not bad
12973,great game to play with friends. the art styles and playable characters are very appealing. Some of the bosses seem to be there just to frustrate you and ill never understand why they weren't reworked. im talking about you corn boss.
12974,Terribly optimised with the lag being horrible even with good internet from all players. You need to play it at low resolution to play without lag but that adds massive black bars on all sides of the display. If this game played without lag on good resolution then it would be 6/10 but with the problems it has it is a 3/10 game.

12983,yes
12984,"One of the better indie games and a classic in it's own right. What started out as a simple and charming beat-em-up turns into a super addictive and somewhat nuanced cooperative game that had me playing for hours and hours on end. The main gameplay loop is extremely addictive with great levels that stand out and amazing boss fights which had me playing for several hours after the credits ended. In both solo and co-op it is fun and for full price you get a lot of content and with tons of additional characters, you get tons of replay value."
12985,"good game, old but gold"
12986,"The game is very fun, and behemoth usually makes very fun games to play with your friends, and this one is pretty good, sure theres not much to do, but its more for the chaos and story, than infinite replayability."
12987,"It's a really fun game! I think parts of the game are easier if you have buddies to play it with (alternatively, you could grind to raise your stats and be able to use better weapons so you stand a better chance on your own). I also found it easier to play with an adapter to let me use a controller as opposed to playing with a keyboard.

Also, I don't care if Hatty is bottom tier, that is my BOY and I would die for him."
12988,"Buy this game it's so good
"
12989,"One of the absolute best games in the history of ever. Anyone who dislikes this game will probably die a horrible and torturous death somewhere all alone with no one to comfort them. lol But really, it's a great game. Just buy it already.

10/10 Would ride the pooping deer over and over"
12990,"pretty good, crashing castles is fun..."
12991,One of the best indie games of all time. A story mode with some hilarious and epic moments that makes you to love this game. Multiplayer story mode is one of the best things that this game has. Also the other game modes are great to have fun with friends or online against other players.

13003,lots of fun alone even more fun with friends
13004,excellent couch co-op game! grab some friends and have a blast!
13005,"A fun little casual game, but the difficulty goes way up past the mid-section(crossing the sea) and you must then grind to raise your attributes in order to progress. Even with your strength fully upgraded, later enemies are absolute damage sponge that keep getting back up. It's just not fun at that point compared to the first half of the game."
13006,good
13007,"This game is so good. I used to play this when I was younger and I have so many memories of it. I recommend it 100%, alone or with friends"

13012,I MEAN its CASTLE CRASHERS! What do you expect?
13013,Played this game loads with my brother back on the xbox 360 and wouldn't have it any other way. A fantastic game full of charm and with a fantastic soundtrack.
13014,"I genuinely believe this to be one of the greatest games of all time. The entire game from the artstyle to the gameplay is so simple yet it hooks you in and lets you become almost addicted to its combat once you have ""mastered"" it. It also helps that the game is designed for you to play it multiple times because every playthrough with one character unlocks another one which is usually a character you have fought against. The game may be short but once you get past the first playthrough you definitely want to play the game again to level your characters and find all the cool little secrets this game has to offer. Also you can beat people to death with a long chicken while throwing chickens at enemies with a chicken pet. definitely pick it up at base price or on sale when it becomes around 4 us dollars"

13039,Side Scroller Minecraft fun with friends.
13040,"its honestly really fun
"
13041,.
13042,"A fun little button mashing side scroller. Best played with friends (2,3,4 people). Hilarious story, creatures and enemies. The art is great and the game, for the most part is smooth. Definitely worth the play through. You can collect different weapons throughout the game and also level up your characters health, speed, archery or magic abilities. 

* Pros
- Smooth Graphics 
- Fun and funny story
- Interesting Story

* Cons 
- Sometimes the screen gets busy
- It is a button masher so yah your fingers are going to hurt and it's a little repatative."
13043,"This used to be the best couch multiplayer game, and it still holds up. While the ai is a bit dated, it is still a very fun game to play when the squad is over and you just want a good time."
13044,"For those who want to remember the glorious days of flash games on Newgrounds, this is your perfect game. Very fun, right amount of challenge and multiple ways of playing, although a tad bit short, but for the current price, it's fantastic.

Side note: I highly recommend you play this with a controller. The game is beatable while playing solo, but playing co op adds more fun and some additional content. Be sure to grab your friends for this"
13045,hnng knights...
13046,one of the best games I've played (as a kid but it's still fun) It's very simple but still entertaining

13056,yes cheat engine works like a charm!
13057,"The game is very fun, especially if you have friends to play with, which I sadly don't... Atleast friends that play Castle Crashers.. BUT! Yes, there is a but, you can go on the discord server Castle Crashers Wiki and find a bunch of great people to play with, I also don't mind playing the game solo."

I saw the recommendations online that this is a good couple's co-op game, so I bought this game to play co-op with my wife. Seems a little too skill-intensive for me and my wife. She got so frustrated that she lost the interest to keep playing. I mean the skill level for normal difficulty doesn't have to be this high, kinda defeats the purpose IMO."

13168,Good game; grind is a bit annoying. Game play is very rewarding.
13169,"I got this epic game for $3 and its really fun. Really simple to get into, hard to master. I personally love collecting all the 30 characters as I play each feeling unique and varied. It rewards the player with these more you play. I will say this can get repetitive after a while, but to be fair it is an old game and still full of fun rewards for unlocking the characters. At least it doesn't have loot boxes."
13170,Tristan doesn't want to play it :(
13171,This game is the best. I played it when i was like 9 years old. And now i started playing it again and i love it. I would also recomend BattleBlock Theater.

13256,"[Obligatory ""My friend got me this game and is making me shout him out"", with that out of the way...]

Castle Crashers is a 2D side-scrolling beat-em-up akin to the old Newgrounds or Flash games I used to play in the mid to late 2000s. The visuals and graphics has a very hand-drawn aspect to it, that I feel endears the game and sets the light and at times absurd tone of the game.

This is a game where you can spend an afternoon just going through it with friends. Pick one of the four magical knights (fire, ice, electricity, poison) and set off to save the princesses from the evil waves of monsters and goons in your path. You can specialize between a magic, or heavy hitting build, and each knight has different aptitudes to each playstyle. Each level design is straight forward, as expected, but feels unique enough to give the game variety. The plethora of various enemies to beat up also adds to variety. As you play along the campaign with friends (because lets be honest, the game is truly experienced only when you play it with someone else), you can come across different weapons or pets, that provide a large array of effects and perks/debuffs that further enhance the combat. You can also occasionally unlock different characters to play as, such as the Grey Knight. They allow for some replay value. Each level has a boss and a few minibosses sprinkled throughout, and they follow a progressive difficulty curve that isn't too hard to match. Castle Crashers in general seems to thankfully lack the grinding that other games of its genre seem to fall into.

There are some negatives to the game, however. The optimization for a mouse and keyboard is a bit wonky, so it is recommended to either use a controller or change the controls. In addition, the game's framerate will sometimes drop randomly, in my experience, regardless of whether there are a large amount of enemies on screen or not. There is also a small nitpick I have with the game sometimes not saving progress in levels if you quit it, regardless if you hit a checkpoint or not. Overall, Castle Crashers is fairly enjoyable, quaint game to play with others, though fifteen dollars is a but expensive for a relatively shorter game, so I'd suggest snagging it on sale."

13270,The amount of fun I had playing this game was the same as when I first played this game on the Xbox 360 many years ago. Juggling enemies in the air with a lollipop never gets old.

13272,"Good game, you can spend a lot of time with friends"
13273,"Entertains the floofpoofs. If you're kinda bored and don't know what to do, beat the game on normal a thousand times to get all the characters. And then beat the game even more on insane mode to get more characters. And then reset and repeat. Until you die. Or get a girlfriend. And then continue when she inevitably breaks up with you for comparing her to your favorite anime characters. For shame."
13274,"love it

13275,amazing game runs smooth fun to play and there is so many interesting bosses
13276,ytges
13277,I had this game for Xbox and I wanted for PC. If you're looking for a good multiplayer game that you can laugh with friends. This is it. Picked this up for $3 and I will probably play this more than some $30 games that I've bought.
13278,Fun.
13279,It is an amazing game to play by yourself and with friends
13280,Great game! Fun to play solo and co-op!
13281,Good game to play co-op
13282,"fun game

Lots of different characters and weapons to unlock.  Each with unique stats.  I played the original on Xbox 360 and i still play it today.  Very good game.  better online in this one compared to original, so that's nice.

Good game btw."
13296,"NICE GAME , NICE GAMEPLAY,NICE STORY, NICE GAYM"
13297,This game is a classic and a lot of fun with friends. There are mini games you can do as well as a story that is intertaning. It is a well made game with many unique characters wepons pets and enamies. There are also bosses in almost every level. 10/10 (with friends this game is a whole lot better and is recomended to have a remote controler.)
13298,"Who wouldn't recommend this game, the Main Menu Soundtrack is addicting, you could listen to it for a very long time, Plus this game is so much more fun when you have a maxed out character that can just one shot random players in the arena. :) Enjoy Castle Crashers, hopefully no one will crash your castle ;)"

13309,"must buy
"
13310,"I don't understand why the reviews are so positive on this game. The game is advertised in such a way that it's hard for a lot of people to not like it. I mean it gives you a feeling that it's an online game, it runs smoothly, it's fair, it has a lot of people playing it, etc. etc.

Nope. I got in the game, you can barely find people playing. At some point I googled something like ""castle crashers no people joining my lobby"". Then I found people when I was waiting literally like 1-2 minutes. Also you can find faster the people by exiting your own lobby and clicking ""Online Multiplayer"", because I think the game is trying first to find a host and when there's no host, it puts you as a host, hence why I was alone waiting those 1-2 entire minutes and starring at my screen.

When someone got in my lobby, we started to play, and before you play a map/ stage, you get a screen to choose where you wanna go. That team member was controlling all the time where we go, and it's fine I guess... with the exception that he was getting me into some sort of arenas.. yes, that's right, pvp arenas where we smack each other. He was just smashing me, 2 hits and I was dead. He was victorious and then when we've got to the screen of choosing where we want to go, again he went arena, again and again. Left the lobby.

Then I joined a lobby that had 3 players in it, so the party was full 4/4, my first full party. I can't even describe how it feels to play this game with others being host...

First of all you gotta know that the keyboard/keybind settings are kinda weird in this game. So you might consider switching them. I've set mine to W, A, S and D as movement keys. When I was pressing an A for example to go left in that 4/4 party, the delay was like 1 entire second to do the action.

Then I joined another party, which we were 3/4 in it. Here it wasn't great either, but this time even worse, that made me to rant in this review as ""smooth gameplay"", and I'm talking about fps. Yep, so constant stutters/ freeze screens due to lack of data/ host.

Another terrible thing is that whenever you're in a stage, there's multiple rooms/ entrances/ screen transitions, which is not the terrible thing, but if you want to go in a freaking room/ entrance/ to make a transition, you do it for the whole group and vice versa. Like imagine being in Path of Exile, and someone enters the boss fight room of Kitava, sucking you in, while you were still doing something in the map.

If I was getting the product that's advertised, that would've been a fucking great game and experience.
I feel scammed, but thank god I bought only the game and not the ""Castle Crashers and Pit People"" which it has a discount until 9th July. I can't possibly believe that this utter garbage is so expensive outside of promotions.

Don't buy this game, don't believe what you're being shown in that video, except the art, animations and the soundtrack. If this game was giving you all those things that are advertised in the video, then a crapload of people would play it, just like how it feels the matchmaking/ ""finding people"" in ""Risk of Rain 2"", but instead, it's like a dead game, with a terrible experience due to its features, systems, etc."
13311,a nice game to defeat bosses and level up and a fun game to play with ur friends

13331,"great  game 
"
13332,a
13333,"OK so Castle Crashers is a really good game. It is easy to learn but can be hard to master, even as somebody who played through everything years ago on xbox, its still good to come back to this smexy game. Music is almost always a bop and the story is interesting but very short and often comedic, Its a shame that there was never new campaigns or anything but still because of the leveling system and WIDE variety of characters, replaying the campaign after you've already completed it once is still enjoyable. I would recommend friends for the campaign but its still perfectly balanced for singleplayer aswell. 

Regarding characters, you start with the 4 standard knights and gradually unlock more when you complete things in the game. Some characters will unlock after Arenas or Insane mode Levels, while others require the completion of the full campaign as a certain character, the only difference between characters is appearance and magic abilities, but in general all of them are fun and cool.

13379,"I'm probably one of the few people negatively reviewing this. It's well-made and executed wonderfully, but I dunno, it just feels repetitive to me. Doesn't feel like it aged all too well."
13380,It's an amazing game! Play it!
13381,"Blood and Gore, yet it doesn't take itself too seriously, 4 player coop which is incredibly chaotic, incredible world design, Magic, Barbarians, Thieves, Bears, Aliens, Cultists, Knights, Snakes, Demons, you name it, Castle Crashers delivers."
13382,Such a fun and funny game
13383,"It is a great game, and to be honest, it made my childhood better. It let me spend more time with my uncle, because I'd always ask ""Can I play with you?"" and since he mostly played Call of Duty, he said no. But when we got this game, it strengthened our bond. We became closer, and we played this all the time. I still play it with my Dad sometimes."
13384,"Fun game, a lot of funny combo's. allthough there only 2 legit good combo's to kill trash. and some levels are really long, they have no checkpoint. if you die u gotto start all over again. and playing solo makes that really hard.

and online multiplayer with a random player doesn't excist as no one does that.

My annoyances in the game:

-Enemies dont have HP bars except bosses.
-Some bosses tend to walk backwards, out of camera view. which is just annoying.
-Shops dont all sell the same stuff.
-Items you get such as the horn and shovel are barely used, but their stuck on your item inventory. which means you have to cycle through them just to swap from your bow to your potion. which is annoying.
-I placed all my points into strenght but it doesn't feel like working. trash enemies still require loads of hits to kill. And you cant continue hitting them as they drop on the floor making you wait for them to stand up.
-Enemies target you, you dont target enemies. Which means if you're surrounded by 5 enemies and you want to target one, he just walks away from you and you can never reach to melee him, which is annoying.
-Ranged enmies tend to time their attack so properly that whenever you are floored and stand up you're instantly hit by a projectile flooring you once again. its annoying and feels like their cheating.
-You can eat a sandwich to bulk yourself for 10seconds but if you fight another bulky enemy they keep wrestling with you making you to spam X button. while your timer runs out and you barely do damage on them. I keep doing aerial combo's just to kill them. It feels more like a chore then fun.

Conclusion: its fun to play with friends, my friends dont like to play this game. there is no discord where you can find people. the matchmaking is dead. Making this a quite frustrating game."
13385,its so funny and i love all the combos you can make
13386,this game aged better than newgrounds animations and flash games ever will.
13387,funny knight moment

13489,10/10 masterpiece of a game. Has stood the test of time and many games made by massive triple A studios don't remotely compare to this game's quality
13490,"Its an awesome and funny game, specially if youre going do play with your friends. Playing alone is good but not as fun as with a party coop, and you will have some difficulties sometimes. But in the end its absolutely great !"

13500,"A classic game, this is one of my favorite originals that I have played here on Steam. I would recommend it to any of my friends and I have played this game with my family. The story line is well done and I enjoyed the multiplayer games that were involved. I didn't like seeing that not all the heroes were playable since I bought the game (not that the heroes are needed) but I would have liked seeing their skills. I've replayed this game many times and I would do it again. Great job!"
13501,i hit x a lot
13502,good fun with my girlfriend
13503,It gud.
13504,this game is a adventure and a cool magic game which  is so fun
13505,Love it
13506,"Castle Crashers looks like a standard beat-em-up game on the surface, but it's definitely more fun the average game of its type.
In Castle Crashers you and your friends play as one of four knights who set off an epic journey to find the princesses that have been kidnapped. Why they were kidnapped beats me, so there are a couple of plot holes. Should you care? Not really, because this game doesn't really focus on the plot in the first place.

Each of these four knights have their own special ability that can be executed on the battlefield. You take your weapon, your shield, and your power, and you hack and slash through swarms of enemies and the occasional boss fight. Yes it has the potential to get boring, but I haven't reached that point in the co-op playthrough.

Throughout the game, you can discover and pick up new weapons and little pets to follow you around, all to be saved in a little shed that you can go back to to change up your stats. So it's your decision whether you want to destroy enemies with an epic vorpal sword or a slab of meat, and whether you want a tiny floating ram following you around or a tiny floating cat.
Each time you play through this game with a different knight, you unlock another character to rip through enemies with, which does add to the motivation of playing.

This game is very quirky. There will be moments in the background that make you look at it and say ""Did that just happen?"" in the ridiculous sense. These moments will even happen in the up close foreground. There are many moments that made me chuckle which made this game all the more appealing.

The soundtrack is pretty badass, to the point where I turned to my brother on multiple occasions and said ""This soundtrack is awesome.""

If you're looking for a coop game, local or online, definitely consider Castle Crashers. It was an enjoyable experience, but it's certainly one that requires you to play with others to be fully satisfied."
13507,It's good.
13508,"all-time classic. 
I remember when I was in primary school, me and my friend used to play the demo everyday. Now, 10 years later we have both bought the game and completed it in 2 nights. Nostalgia at its finest, really fun game."

13528,"This game is good at making you, hate your friends. 10/10 would recommend."
13529,"C'mon, it's castle crashers."
13530,"This game has always been fun, from the 360 to the remastered edition. Pretty simple, but still an enjoyable experience, especially with friends."
13531,I HATE EVERYTHING. DEAR GOD WHY
13532,It's too good that I don't even need to explain.

13543,Really fun to play with friends. Not like I would know though. The only major flaw with this game is the god forbidden volleyball section.
13544,it good
13545,"Honestly, probably my favorite arcade-like multiplayer game.
Castle Crasher's gameplay is a relatively simple hack and slash, but it's absolutely oozing with personality and is just a lot of fun to play with friends
9/10"
13546,"a classic beat m up, you cant go wrong with it.
you definitely want to play with a friend or two, because the difficulty isnt meant for one.
the game casually progresses in difficulty, appropriate speed, not all games do that.
graphics? classic newgrounds, made by tom fulp himself, what do you expect.
gameplay/controls? the keyboard controls are terrible, but i use lots of binds that make it ""playable"".
console/controller controls? so good, i used to have this on xbla360 and used console controls, and they are genius.
multiplayer? what the fuck yes
need a good pc? nah, you could probably play this nicely on a work computer.
thanks for reading my review on castle crashers."
13547,w
13548,It is a good game. I like that I can co-op play and it actually saves everything that we've both done while playing to my device and to his so if I do want I can play on my own. Along with that it has a pleasant art style and coloring. There are lots of immature but funny funny jokes in the game and it has hard but forgiving levels and I thought I wouldn't like the game but my friends convinced me to get it and I genuinely enjoyed myself while playing
13549,Best old school style game ever!! with a varieties of characters to choose from with unique POWWARRR!!

13562,"Its cheap, and doesn't take up much space, but is still fun and playable with friends. I reccomend playing with other people. Playing solo is harder and gets boring over time."
13563,"Extremely fun, and if you got some friends to play with its amazing, definitely won't regret it!"
13564,"oh. my gosh. this game has such a cute and expressive art style, and the controls (I'm sure on PC) are very easy to grasp. (at least for me lmao.) this is also challenging too, which makes me even more immersed! also, bonus points for amazing character design and a good, straight-forward idea."

13570,Great game Tons of fun and eazy to play 10/10
13571,Good
13572,"I remember playing this all the way back in the early Xbox Live Arcade days, it was fun then and it's still definitely fun now. It's a good arcade game to play when you're bored or with friends. Definitely buy the DLC characters, they're really fun too and just keep the game fresh. You also get another DLC character ""Hatty Hattington"" if you buy Battleblock Theater. Take advantage of the Castle Crasher and Battleblock theater bundle, especially during sales! Wonder if they'll ever make a sequel, would be hella interesting."
13573,"ABSOLUTLEY AMAZING
"
13574,"Originally had this on the PS3 back in late 2012. The amount of time I have had on that version is exponential to what I currently have on the computer. Which goes to show how ridiculously fun this is

Castle Crashers is your average Beat 'Em Up/Scroller but with they way they executed the gameplay function especially with a group setting, it is essentially the closest you can get to perfection.

As much of a nostalgic tie I have had with this title, for new players as well you will easily find the same amount of enjoyment just by how silly this game plays out. Castle Crashers is tons of fun in a solo player experience, but with a full four man party, has the power to create some of the greatest memories out of the pure laughter and enjoyment of just doing wacky stuff with your buddies. 

The game overall is fairly short if you play each level back to back, but the game rewards the effort to go above and beyond and search throughout each level. By doing so, you get the opportunity to find many different types of weapons hidden around, as well as pets that you can bring into your arsenal and pick and choose at any given moment. Although this game is short for a one time playthrough, every time you beat the game, depending on who you chose for your first adventure you unlock a character based on who you picked. And by picking that character you have just unlocked you can finish the game again and obtain another character as well.

Castle Crashers also does a great job by showing you just how much you are progressing as a whole. With it's simple level up system, being able to increase specific stats based on your preference. And although there are different trees you can max out first, each one is based on a different playstyle, therefore if you want to play far back or front line, you have the ability to do so and work on both at the exact same time.

The story of the game goes like so: You are a Knight celebrating at a party/gathering within the castle walls. As you party your little heart out, a warrior gets toppled into the room covered in blood and proceeds to die. You and your squadron proceed to check the perimeter of the area, only to find out that the King is being attacked by an evil wizard, who proceeds to steal a magic crystal that the King has held in his possession for quite sometime. After the Wizard escapes, the King declares a demand of action to return the crystal to its rightful place. After hearing said declaration, you and your teammates make your way out through the land as you find out where the Wizard lies, to defeat him and return the King's crystal. Not even seconds after you venture outward, you see that the Princesses of the land proceed to get kidnapped by the Wizard's henchmen, and you are now faced with a second trial in which you have to rescue these fair maidens as well.

[spoiler] After you save the Princess, you are allowed to kiss her as a token of her gratitude. If you are playing with friends however, it turns into a free for all, showing who truly has the strength to deserve her kiss. Playing this throughout my years I have never had more fun in this game than during these little mini events. The amount of tension and chaos between me and my friends, shouting who deserves to kiss her first, or who thinks she's pretty and therefore they deserve it are memories I will always cherish. [/spoiler]

With that said, this game is a banger and if you don't give it a try imma come over there and slap you with my leftover Snickerdoodle."
13575,Solid.
13576,yes :>
13577,This is a great game to play with friends and its a very casual and easy game.
13578,"This is a very fun game and very enjoyable with other friends, but still fun even solo."
13579,"it's fun if you have friends
refunded since i don't have friends lol"
13580,Short but good.
13581,"[h1]A good classic 2D fighting game, but the most tilting thing is that you have to buy Behemoth’s other game, Battle Block Theatre to get all the achievements[/h1]

Okay, this game is quite old so you do have to give it some breaks here in there, I’ll give a quick overview of the positives and negatives first.

[b]The Good[/b]
[List]
[*]Long Campaign with many boss fights
[*]Up to 4 players can join in on campaign
[*]Local Co-op [b]and[/b] Online Co-op
[*]Interesting art style, its like the old animations on Newgrounds
[*]A mini game mode (you have to try and survive while you move a character across a map as pawns try to stomp your character)
[/list]

[b]The Bad[/b]
[List]
[*]Extreme lag, imagine 0.2 FPS if you are playing online Co-op and your host has a weak connection or you have a weak connection your host
[*]The variety of characters in the game is a bit pointless, the only thing that makes them different from each other is how they look and their magic attack.
[*]weapons aren’t that interesting in this game, as you progress you’ll find more weapons that are increasingly better but they contain buffs and de-buffs which makes it so you can’t ever get a hold of a weapon that is just good and cool, its a matter of picking the best trash.
[/list]

These negatives are not that crucial to your enjoyment of the game they are a bit nit picky but things that should be stated regardless. This game is still good, and buying it at 80% off is a great deal."
13582,"i've played this game since it was on xbox360, i heard about it by chance and i recognized behemoth because of their dumb ass logo(giant chkn) i played alien hominid on ps2 and that shit smacked hard. play this game by yourself of with your friends and you'll have fun, the mechanics aren't hard to get hit markers are sometimes hard but other than that the game is continuously fun. it's old as shit and ive kept this game loaded in my library more than most of my games. Enjoy it for the first time or once again and check out their other games"
13583,chadstle crashers
13584,It's Fun l kiss girl
13585,good game
13586,yes
13587,"its good
no one has sauce though and its a spongy beat em up"
13588,green knight goes brrrrr
13589,"Отличный выбор для тех, кто хочет провести уютный вечер на диване рядом с друзьями."
13590,"good game, can be replayed"
13591,ebusdfgciknv9
13592,it's pretty great home boi
13593,"I have fond memories of playing this side-scrolling, beat ‘em up game with friends years ago while consuming obscene amounts of candy and soda. Although a lot of time has passed since those days, this game is still a lot of fun. The story is quite entertaining and has the strange but funny charm that games made by The Behemoth are known for. The visuals match the typical cartoony style of The Behemoth as well and while they aren’t anything revolutionary, they still look nice despite their age. The gameplay is quite entertaining, even if it often boils down to mashing buttons as quickly as possible, and I’ve found it quite stable, only encountering the rare bug here or there. It also supports single-player if you’d rather go it alone, although it is much more fun to play with friends, and I’d highly recommend grabbing a couple of buddies to play with if you can, either locally or online. Plus, this game goes on sale fairly often for only a few bucks, so you’ll likely be able to grab it for quite cheap if you’re patient.

The only negative thing about this game that I can think about is unlocking new characters is a bit of a grind, as it forces you to complete the game with each character to unlock a new one, requiring quite a few playthroughs to unlock all of them. This is a fairly minor gripe though, and likely won’t bother you at all unless you're a completionist.

All in all, this is a fun game to play by yourself and a fantastic game to play with friends, and I would highly recommend picking this one up."
13594,very gud game
13595,best game ever to exist i cold buy this game a dozen times a not feel ripped off this is the best a game can get one hundred pecrent satisfaction guarnteed
13596,"Artstyle and music are fantastic, and it can be fun with friends. I had a great time playing in on Xbox 360 ~8 years ago, but it doesn't seem to hold up so well now.

For being a side-scrolling brawler game, the combat feels very clunky and imprecise. There's a kind of floaty delay to your movement, and a lot of your attacks will miss because you will technically be swinging right in front of an enemy or right behind them. When an attack doesn't connect you don't feel like it's your fault for missing, but the game's fault for not knowing what you want to do.

A lot of the enemies are very frustrating to fight as well. Get used to being stun-locked, swarmed, and sniped with range attacks. Bosses can be very spongy as well, and it seems like you're just repeating the same combo over and over to whittle down their health bar rather than having a proper battle. Again, when you die it doesn't feel like it's your own fault.

If you've never played Castle Crashers before and have some friends, then go for it. Otherwise look elsewhere."
13597,"One of the best games of all time in my opinion, if more people played I would play more often. 10/10 would kiss another princess"
13598,"a well made beat'em up game which i enjoy very much. the fighting feels fun and keeps you on your toes, and in case you want to rage insane mode exists... thieves forest exists in insane mode and that explains why some people might rage in insane mode but i haven't much-okay this is getting to long  shorten it 10/10 would go do some slice & dice & hocus & pocus again!"
13599,"Twice as fun as BattleBlock Theater
Just buy it you wont regret"
13600,Please step on me Red Knight.
13601,this game amazing yes

13604,game is fun. Not to hard not to easy. But overall fun game to play with friends.
13605,cool
13606,gamerrr
13607,"I used to play this game for hours and hours on the Xbox 360. I actually had legitimately maxed out multiple characters to level 99. It goes without saying that I recommend this game, even if you plan on only playing through the campaign once, its still an amazing experience."
13608,Perfect representation of a good beat 'em up.
13609,It is sooo fun with other people
13610,the pup!!!!!!!!!
13611,"Does anyone even read reviews in 2020?

That aside, real chill game. Good one to stay up with family and crash some castles."
13612,"a masterpiece that I've been playing for over a decade

just get it

it's your destiny"
13613,muy bueno y adictivo
13614,"good game, i beat it on ps4 and it is really good!"
13615,it's gets old over time and just kills all the fun and jus become so repetitive. overall it gets way to fast boring it's like one of those mobile games where you play for 30 min and then just delete it. my final rating 2 out of 10
13616,this game is funky monky and goo
13617,Its fun with friends and simple to jump into

13619,"A timeless classic. I can look back at the countless hours I've spent sitting on the couch with my friends from middle school playing this game and laughing hysterically at the [i]tasteless[/i] but hilarious and loveable humor. I bought this game to try and relive the nostalgia, but I was utterly stunned by how deep the mechanics and gameplay of this game is. Combos are difficult but rewarding to pull off, there are tons of characters, magic types, weapons and pets, and the Insane Mode is forever unbeatable to me.

11/10, might get tired of the potato-comedy at some point, but will never get tired of the memories and gameplay."
13620,I've played this game on a xbox 360 in about 2015 and now have bought it on steam :)
13621,Epic
13622,"I played this on the Xbox 360 Arcade years ago a lot.

I believe this game uses peer-to-peer when playing online, and there is some latency when playing online.

It is more enjoyable when you play with a friend.

Red knight is superior."
13623,"a very good game, when i was young i played this at my cousins house and it was so fun i talked to my parents about it and they said ( when you will be older we will buy it) it been so long since i wanted it and now i have it and it so fun , if you ask me if it worth the money i would say ( if it was double the prise i would still think it would be worth) 10/10 you should really buy it
"

13625,"this game is this .. tih a,. this game is ngo od i like khitting te little boys ..."
13626,really good for co-op to play with friends or any body with u in the hoom
13627,"if you didn't play this in your childhood then im afraid you dont have a childhood 

You should play this with a friend or more people when you complete the game you unlock more characters which makes the game very fun to replay i dont think you should get the dlcs as the characters themselves are one of the worst in the game but they look cool so if you dont care about how good they are in game you should buy them."
13628,Hey this game is pretty good
13629,Is fun
13630,this game is my life

this game is cartoon style game with funny cut scenes and gameplay 
play as one of the knights to save the princesses, challenge your friends to duel against you or just go and kill the enemy with the mighty sword of your choice
all i got to say is that this game is one of the best games that i had as a child and i recommend it for everyone who wants to be a little happier in their lifes"

13647,Very fun game with friends
13648,"The Good: It's a fun button-masher that is most fun played with friends (either couch co-op or online). It reminds me a lot of the original Double Dragon I played as a kid. It has interesting and varied boss fights.

The Bad: can be frustrating at times against certain enemies, and can get repetitive. Perhaps best played in small doses.

The Ugly: It mocks saving-the-princess stereotypes by really pushing it to the most ridiculous limit.  There are poop jokes. You might find it offensive or funny, YMMV"
13649,"Good classic game
Very retro"
13650,"Fun. loved it a lot on xBox, even more on PC. Intense mechanics and difficult maneuver. Would not recommend if you've never played SSB."

13657,"Castle Crashers® it's just adventure game with awesome gameplay.
there is 4 knights on start (fire, electric, frost, poison) but later we can get more characters passing the game.
In this game we have a lot of swords, and a few animal orbs. 

I recommend playing with someone because it can be fun.
:D
"
13658,"Very fun to play with friends, and love all the different pets to collect and the secrets. I also like the character progression system, where you can unlock new characters after defeating the game with them."
13659,its good
13660,"good
"
13661,it's a good time waster for whenever i feel bored.
13662,NICE GAME
13663,"Ah, Castle Crashers.
This game is brilliant though would probably only resonate with a select number of personalities. 
Castle Crashers is a beat 'em up 2D RPG, if you've ever played the developers other games (Battleblock Theater, Pit People) Then you will recognise the style well.
It has a interesting story with the main driver being the humour behind the game, I would rate this game a 7/10."
13664,pretty good game. i'd love to see castle crashers 2 bay beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
13665,Very epic game
13666,very fun game much better to play with friends would recomned 5/5 starts
13667,...
13668,"Fun side-scrolling game, good to play by yourself or if you feel like getting dicked down with a buddy, invite him or her to the session using the remote play, or stick one of them fancy controllers in that tight little hole on that beefy ass pc you have and prepare to get railed."
13669,"I played this game back before I was in Junior High some time ago when I still had it on the Xbox 360. I had a blast back then, and it was overall a really great experience.

Has this changed? Absolutely not. The game is still a blast, and when I was playing it with a friend who's never played the game before, we ended up finding ways to abuse game mechanics and overall it was an absolute blast. We didn't stop playing once and we made it all the way through the normal game and immediately started Insane Mode.

I absolutely recommend that anyone play this, ESPECIALLY if you have friends that like to just mess around.

Also... INVEST SOME POINTS IN MAGIC. PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST."
13670,It's a masterpiece.
13671,very nice

13684,it is good
13685,"The game was lots of fun to play with my girlfriend, but progressing through the game, it soon became extremely grindy with no way to turn down difficulty or use cheats. So after we had to replay certain levels over and over to get coin and xp, and still not being able to get past the next, we abandoned the game and moved on to others. Disappointing unfortunately."
13686,poop jokes
13687,"good game

13721,"Decent, very fun with a full team of friends, sometimes is hard to complete the levels but u can spam the heal potion or other things."
13722,buy this game
13723,Great game. It reminds me of all of the fun I had on my Xbox 360 with my friends
13724,You can have funny pets in this game

13726,take me back to the good ol' days when homies would come over to play this with everyone having a jolly ol' time
13727,gud game
13728,"wow, good game!"
13729,A fun beat-em-up; short and sweet.
13730,It's a good game.

13734,This is THE essential 2D side scrolling beat em up that everyone should be required to own. You still don't have it? Hurry up and buy it!
13735,Fun as b word cheeks game
13736,this game is great just can get baring somtime's
13737,This game made me realize that I suck at video games
13738,It's good. If only the combat in insane mode wasn't so repetitive.

13744,"Lot of fun to play with other players. Good game to screw around, and the multiple ways to play including different abilities and animals allows for different ways to play"
13745,I've got more hours on my play-station than here but having it on steam makes it easier to give it out to my friends and link up for great play. This game is highly recommended between its cute yet hilarious art-style and its challenging yet fun level based combat features. Beating the game isn't enough because the hardcore campaign is a whole challenge in itself that i am yet to complete. Good luck crashers.
13746,"Fun
"
13747,fun
13748,"played it sense the xbox 360 days will always recommend this game
"
13749,"It's an amazing game! If you like 2d style beat-em up games, Castle Crashers is perfect for you! The best thing about it is you can play with 3 friends! A downside though is anyone can force exit the level for all players, other than that, this game is flawless! The best part of the game is the bosses. (In my opinion of course.) This game was the first game I bought on steam and I still enjoy playing it!"
13750,Great game still holds up from when I played back in the xbox 360 era. And the last updates were great just wished they added a OST so I could listen to all the sweet tracks.
13751,yes
13752,Ver fun game.
13753,very fun and entertaining
13754,"honestly like one of my favourite games ever. used to play it a lot with my brother on the ps3 and now ive played with my friends so much. really fun game to play with friends yeah. though this game isnt for everyone, but at least give it a shot. mm love this"
13755,fun
13756,great game and fun with friends if you are looking for a good time definetly pick this game up 9/10
13757,this hit me with alot of nostagia becuase i used to play it with my uncle
13758,"This game isn't bad if you're into the hack-and-slash genre. Myself, not so much; I prefer the new God of War to the old series and I couldn't make it through a Darksiders game. If you like action-packed button mashing with minimal pick-ups and character upgrades then I would recommend this to you."
13759,Swag
13760,"be me: have no friends to play with
be me: play online but people have 99 level knights somehow, mfw complete the full game and only get to level 30"

13762,"good game
"
13763,"really good game :]
"
13764,"this game is not for everybody, as that is true I do hope you find great joy in this game, I did. this is a type of game where your choices affect the ""class you are playing"" and there are many bosses and minibosses all which come in a different difficulty. I do recomend that you play this with a friend so that it is a much nicer playthrough."
13765,fun great amazin epic awesome great fantabytastic fantastic
13766,"good game
was a little confused when i started but i got it"
13767,Great game totally suggest getting it. I loved how the more you play the more players you get to play as.
13768,det smager flot
13769,pretty lit
13770,"This game is always a lot of fun. The only thing that ruins it for me is the online community that doesn't know what it's doing and they don't give control to one specific member of the group, so if you're low level a high level can drag you to the end boss and let you get crushed..."
13771,It was fun.
13772,"can someone buy this game for me

EDIT: thank you"
13773,Great classic game to play with your friends.

13785,it's fun
13786,Repetitive and dull gameplay. No story
13787,"as childish as it may look, its addicting and challenging. very funny and art work is amazing."
13788,"Played this back on the Xbox 360 with 3 friends. Recently got to play this again with the same 3 friends almost 10 years later and it's still just as fun as we remember. This time around we want to see if we can do it on Hardcore mode. Only got in a good hour at the time of this review, hope we can schedule another day to try more. Don't play this alone. You'll enjoy the absolute chaos that comes with having 4 players on screen. One of my favorite beat'em up games right next to the Scott Pilgrim game."
13789,play it is very good
13790,Great
13791,Incredibly fun with and engaging story if you play it with friends but it becomes a lot harder by yourself
13792,I've loved this game for a long time and it still brings me joy to this day!
13793,Very good strength is balanced magic is very overpowered for characters like the guy you unlock with the ice knight defence can be very good its the same with agility
13794,"I bought this game due to the nostalgia I got from seeing it once again. When I played, it was even better, despite not many people to play with. There are so many things to do, and things to collect, that you will spend a lot of time having fun with the game. It's also extremely fun with friends! I'd give this game a solid 10 out of 10."

13821,i like
13822,its very good
13823,"Castle Crashers is a competent beat-em-up, but it's not exceptional. It seems designed primarily to showcase Behemoth's art style by providing a wide range of pets, weapons, and characters that have unique art but relatively generic gameplay effects. Worse, the game requires grinding for XP in order to progress, often necessitating replaying old levels. It's just not for me."
13824,n
13825,Very nice
13826,"I first played this game when I was seven years-old on the Playstation 3 edition and I loved it. My older cousin played the game with me and we played all the way up to the orange Princesses first mission. I fell in love with the game and bought it on my Playstation 3 when I got home. The game has silly sense of humour and a simple but enjoyable story! I recently downloaded the game on Steam. I tried playing with the keyboard but ended up using my Steam controller. There is a great amount of weapons to choose from and excellent boss battles! Each set of levels has you setting off for another Princess with each having their self contained stories. Completing the game with each of the Knights will allow you to unlock the enemies as playable characters.

13827,i luv this game
13828,Amazing game so much fun lots of level reccmomended to play with friends
13829,so much gore if you handle it its fun

13832,"Um dos melhores jogos de ""briga de rua"" que existe."
13833,Castle crashers and og dungeon defenders were both equally amazing.
13834,I've been playing castle crashers ever since I was wee lad back in my kinder years. The side scrolling combat is super traditional and done right.
13835,"iv played fall more of this game than steam says, i played it on xbox 360 when it first came out. its amazing"
13836,"great game good with friends except i have none but still a great game

13856,At the beginning it was fun but with 4 people it just seems like button spamming with little skill and little fun towards the end. Like the jokes though. (INCREASED TIME FOR LEAVING GAME ON OVER NIGHT)
13857,"Fun to play with friends or without. The graphics are pleasant, the gameplay is awesome, the difficulty scales to a high level while the game processes. The story is not very long, but you can try the difficult mode when you complete the game, which will keep you for quite some more time."
13858,good
13859,hell yeah you should play this 100
13860,love the game
13861,"Very good game!!! I remember playing it years ago on Xbox360 and I got the urge to buy and play it again recently! It's a pretty simple game, not too hard but enough to offer a challenge and hours of fun. I definitely recommend grabbing a few friends for this one. Playing alone is still a fun experience but as most multiplayer go, it's always more fun with more people."

13864," If you like chads in white knights , this is the game for you"
13865,there is quite alot of content availible to play but if your the kind of person who doesnt care much for the story they didnt put any guards to stop hacking so we could skip certain levels  (dont ask how i know how)  and its a generaly good game

13870,"I played this game for 30 hours, and now I am a Mormon."
13871,"If you want to play a great beat-em up full of humor and Newgrounds' references, Castle Crashers has you covered. It seems simple at first, but the more you practice hitting the enemies in the air without letting them fall, the better you'll get fighting bosses and even your friends in the arena. It also has some mini-games that deviate from the beat-em up stuff. Overall, it's a fun multiplayer experience to have with friends."
13872,i get to be a gay knight with gay abilitys. which is kinda gamer ngl
13873,the best with friends mostly

But insane mode sucks big ass chicken"
13878,ITS LIKE REAL LIFE BUT A GAME
13879,its a cute party game that ramps up in difficulty near the end. its a classic in the modern day and is worth your time in my opinion but only with friends. not really worth playing with randoms or solo at all.
13880,"
"
13881,Castle Crashers is a solid 6/10 in my book! It has nice graphics and pretty fun beat em up gameplay! Sadly the game is very repetitive after you beat it but that's fine! Sadly even though the game is best with co op nobody actually really plays it a lot... Then again this is a very old game. Anyways thanks for reading this review if you have stumbled upon checking out Castle Crashers.
13882,very fun
13883,fuck yea!!!!!!!!!!
13884,good
13885,"Very fun with friends. In single-player too. I don't see anything negative about this game, at least that comes to mind. I'll edit this review if that changes (I'm going to play through it again). So that's a good sign... The fact that I'm playing it AGAIN... Ya know?"
13886,"i love thes game

13891,yEs
13892,great game! I'v been playing it for years on the X-Box 360 and I'm so glad I could get it on steam and relive those days
13893,"This game is the best thing I have ever played in my life. The balancing of enemy fights? Superb. The story? Not too much depth, could use some work, but hey, whatever. Combat mechanics? Mwah! Oh how lovely it is to just fuckin' smack things, or spawn damaging rainbows while holding a peace sign. I love it so very much. Though, how long you can play it is... debatable. But, nonetheless, I love this game in all of its entirety."
13894,It
13895,"Castle Crashers and BattleBlock Theater will always have a very special place in my heart, due to how much of my childhood it is

It's art style and humor may seem dated to people, but honestly, even in this year, one of it's jokes could just really get me laughing until my vision blurs

The skill point mechanic, magic, wide cast of knights to choose, and it's simple battle mechanics can keep a group of 4 playing for hours

This game means the world to me, as it was one of the first games on Xbox that allowed me to connect with my older brother




This game also taught me to fear those with the Yeti"

13901,One of the most enjoyable games for me so far!

13903,ITS GREAT  YOU SHOULD GET IT
13904,yes

13906,"originally played this game on Xbox360, loved it from start to finish. i dislike the keybinds though."
13907,You CAN play this game by yourself but it's really meant to be played with friends and you'll have a much better time.
13908,super cool dude! would buy the remasted edition for sure!

13913,"great gamy but controler neaded good time 
"
13914,good game
13915,"Fun, Humorous, and addicting."
13916,Its a classic
13917,"I'm not quite sure what all the hype is about this game. I have tried to get into it at least three times now, and have been unable to work up the motivation to continue each time. Perhaps the game just isn't for me; however, there are some glaring flaws to me that really caused me and the friends I tried it with to stop playing due to a lack of enjoyment.

Castle Crashers does do a few things well. I like the games art style and sound design, much in the way Battleblock Theatre (same developer) has a fun cartoon outlook. The game is silly, which also lends to a casual play style; it is supposed to be easy to approach and play. 

In the end, there are 2 main things that completely halted my desire to keep playing. The first (and more minor) is that the game is supposed to be funny but simply wasn't to me and my friends. In game scenarios that are supposed to be funny flat out weren't. They wound up being awkward and dumb; some of them you have to watch multiple times if you have to replay a section, decreasing the humor even further.

The bigger reason I don't want to try this game again after multiple attempts is the frustrating game play we encountered. This was seen in a few ways...

-For a beat em up game, the beat em up mechanics felt very clunky and airy. It is hard to tell where you are within relation to enemies and objects on the screen, meaning you miss what should be an obvious hit ALL the time. It became frustrating very quickly to constantly miss when standing just pixels off center, when you are right next to your target, ESPECIALLY when...

-The enemies are NOT fun to fight. Now, this only pertains to the first few levels, because I couldn't bear to endure any more, but the enemies certain ones, not all, but you face them a TON) have a lot of health, stun lock you, and swarm the screen. Combine this with frustrating hit mechanics and it can become both frustrating and tedious quite quickly, ESPECIALLY when...

-The checkpoint system felt dumb to us. While it is a casual game and it doesn't feel THAT bad to replay a section, it IS tedious and makes everything feel like a chore. You got through a section and now lost to the boss? You have to replay that ENTIRE section again, even though you just beat it.

All in all, the game play was very frustrating and unsatisfying. When you finally do beat these long sections full of hassle, you don't really feel like you accomplished anything. It's just ""time to start the next level, wasn't that fun!?"" 

Hammerwatch is a much better beat em up (as are plenty of others), and Battleblock Theatre is a much better game from this developer. I'm not sure what the craze is or why the reviews are so high, but I will not be finishing this game or trying it again in the future."

Please add PS4 controller support on MAC. I can move the selection but the ""A"" button does not seem to work"
13942,"Very good 11/5 Lots of fun, better with friends"
13943,bid.
13944,"Fun and well made, but if you have a bad internet connection or PC, then don't get this game without knowing that you're going to suffer. Multiplayer has extremely bad input lag, will buffer every few seconds, you'll likely never just leave a game because you'll crash, and singleplayer still has insane input lag.

Did I forget to mention the input lag? It's not just like, 1 second or half a second, not even 2 seconds. It's nearly THREE.

TL;DR, really good and fun, but know what you're in for if you've got a bad PC/internet connection.

Edit: I got a new PC, and I was right. Known what you're in for if you have a bad PC. This one is not bad, though, and I can play without input lag."

13978,"[h1]The princesses have been kidnapped! Are you a bad enough dude to save the princesses and stop the evil Necromancer?[/h1]

Right off, I need to say that I have owned and played the Xbox 360 version of this game more than the steam version, but the two seem to be almost identical in the ways that matter so my review is based on my time with both.

This is the greatest beat-'em-up ever made, in my opinion. It's not the deepest (my vote would go to Treasure's ""Guardian Heroes"" for that category), nor is it the prettiest (it looks more like a cheap flash game than anything else, probably owing to its authors' humble beginnings on Newgrounds), but it makes up for it with personality, chaos, and outright fun!

Okay, let's get into the meat:

This is a four-player simultaneous side-scrolling beat-'em-up in the same vein as Konami's arcade original ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" (if you don't know what I'm talking about, go and play it right now any way you can -- I'll wait), so if you like similar games the chances are that you're going to love this one.

 Each player takes on the role of a noble knight of one of four colors (though additional knights and characters are unlockable as you play). Like similar entries in the genre, every player starts out with a basic attack, a hard attack, a magic attack, and a jump, but the key to this game is that your characters can level up as you play; leveling up unlocks even more combos, increases magic attacks, and adds stat boosts to help you take hits or give them.  As you play, you'll also unlock additional weapons that will alter your stats and floating ""animal orbs"" (little helpers that follow you around) that will give your character special abilities and perks. 

Level progression starts out linear, but soon becomes a branching path that opens up exploration as you try to find the four stolen princesses. Every time you do manage to rescue a princess, you and your players are forced to fight each other in a duel to the death for her affection (ala ""Double Dragon""), giving the normal cooperative play a pause for some PVP action (there's also an arena if you want to have a fighting tournament with your friends, although that is by far the least amusing part of the game that I've found).

Like similar games in the genre, it can get repetitive, and the scale of it is something to behold (this is no mere 30 minute playthrough, as this game can demand hours of your time), but that also works in its favor, as there are always new locations and characters to unlock, enemies to encounter, weapons to master, and humorous scenarios to uncover, and playing with some willing friends for some couch co-op can make for a very entertaining evening."

[u]Castle Crashers[/u] is a pure beat-em-up side-scroller designed to be played solo or in a group of up to four players. These players have access to a wide variety of characters and types of combat to help spice up both solo and party play. Characters only differ in their type of magic, with many being unique or having secondary effects. Players can choose their combat style based on the levels they allot from the XP they gain; Strength boosts melee damage, Magic boosts magical damage and unlocks new types of spells, Defense gives the player more resistance to attacks, and Agility increases the speed of both the player and the strength of their archery attacks. This simple system ensures that while the player focuses on beating up enemies during a level, what skills they choose to rank up matter a lot.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2112516093

The game also features a few other mechanics to help add further depth to the experience. Weapons give positive and negatives to the player’s stats, allowing for min/maxing or enhancing of a certain playstyle past the level cap. For example, one weapon might give +3 Strength, but -3 Agility. Animal Orbs are little companion creatures that follow the player and performs beneficial actions of varying type. Giraffey increases XP gain by 10%, Hawkster fetches food from dead enemies, and Rammy will periodically attack enemies for you. Simple additions such as these help keep Castle Crashers engaging across multiple playthroughs.

[b][u]Pros[/u][/b]
[list]
[*] Enjoyable beat-em-up action that can be played with friends.

[*] Good variety in gameplay styles that allows for easy replayability.

[*] A large amount of campaign content, with optional PvP available for those that enjoy it.

[/list]

[b][u]Cons[/u][/b]
[list]
[*] Enemies can become tanky in late levels, punishing a player for wishy-washy skill choices and not dedicating to a playstyle. 

[*] The game can be somewhat rough to play solo, as it was intended to be played with friends. Introverts beware. 

[*] XP gain is based on the amount of hits, not the strength of that hit. This makes pure Strength builds gain XP at a lower rate than other builds.
[/list]

[h1]Short Conclusion: Highly Recommended 
(Especially with friends)[/h1]

[h1][u]In-Depth Analysis[/u][/h1]

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
As previous stated, Castle Crashers has melee, magic, and archery to choose from as methods of combat, enabled by the skills you choose to level up. All three forms of combat are viable with proper investment, although the system does have some nuances. 

Strength increases the melee damage you deal, but this is a double-edged blade. While melee damage is effective against almost all enemies, the XP you gain is based on the amount of times you hit an enemy, not the damage you do. This means builds with high Strength will gain less XP from a fight than everyone else, but are much more effective than other types of builds in terms of reliably putting out damage.

Magic is very useful as a form of ranged combat, and every 5 levels in the skill unlocks a new type of spell. However, certain enemies heavily resist specific types of magic. Fire Demons resist flame magic, Eskimos resist ice magic, and so on. This means solely depending on Magic can result in a very hard wall being hit during a playthrough. However, some enemies are extremely weak to a specific type of magic as well. Magic takes thought and strategy but is generally regarded to be the highest burst damage possible when not resisted.

Archery is one two benefits of upgrading Agility, the other being an increase in overall speed. Archery starts out rather weak, with a limited range and slow firing speed, but with high investment into Agility it becomes a borderline machine gun of arrows that travel the full length of the screen. Enemies can barely stand up under the onslaught of arrow fire an Agility build can put out. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2113023935

Weapons and Animal Orbs are also a big part of your strategy, but this is a mechanic more understood after playing the game. The skill buffs / debuffs and unique Orb abilities allow for even more customization than you would expect from such a simple system. For example, I usually run Hawkster for his ability to gather food, allowing for high sustainability during a level. I also wield the Golden Sword for +5 Strength, +5 Magic, and -3 Agility, since my character uses Magic and Strength but not any Agility. Some weapons also carry bonus effects, such as critical chance, poison, fire, or freezing. 

Weapons and Animal Orbs are unlocked either by finding them in a level (perhaps even hidden and requiring some backtracking) or defeating an enemy that carries it. The types of weapons you unlock depends on your luck and how good you are at discovering hidden locations using items you gain later in the playthrough. 

The only potential problem with Castle Crashers is that the game throws quite a lot of enemies at you during levels, as it was designed to be played with friends, not solo. The game is still very much possible solo, as I have done, but it requires more skill and perseverance from the player if this is the case. I encourage you to play with friends for the best experience.

Attempting to play the game in Insane Mode, unlocked upon defeat of the final boss, also pretty much requires the use of juggling, or the act of keeping an enemy in the air by attacking them for as long as possible. This is because of the obscene amount of health even basic enemies can have in Insane Mode. Insane is very much a masochist’s task if attempting it solo. 

[h1]Story[/h1]
Castle Crashers was more focused on action than story, but the story can be gleaned from a few cutscene interactions throughout the campaign. You play as one of four knights seeking to reclaim the King’s magical crystal and save the princesses. The cutscenes are fairly humorous and add a nice charm to the game that reminds a player of its origins on Newgrounds, a site many old internet users are familiar with. 

[h1]Audio[/h1]
There isn’t much to write home about with the audio. A lot of the game features enjoyable, if basic, music tracks infinitely looping over the gameplay. The clanking of the weapons and the spray of the magic matches the feel of the game, and overall it complements the gameplay, but doesn’t add anything on its own.

[h1]Technical[/h1]
Castle Crashers was designed to run on the Xbox 360, a console that came out in 2005. I would be genuinely surprised if you couldn’t run this game as smooth as butter on any computer made past 2010. However, it is worth noting that the game is more enjoyable to play on a controller than keyboard, but unlike some other games (Dark Souls), the game is still perfectly playable on a keyboard layout. You won’t suffer from a lack of controller.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Castle Crashers is a fantastic beat-em-up game that offers a large variety of possible playstyles to encourage experimentation and multiple playthroughs. While enjoyable solo, the game shines when playing with friends or other players, and makes for some fantastic action either way. While not the cheapest game out there at $14.99, I would argue it is worth the full price, and goes on sale very often if that is still too expensive for your taste.

14003,"This game is gamer. Everything about it is just fun. This game shows that you don't need an overarching story to make a good game. I recommend this game to anyone who just wants to have fun. If you want to have a fun time, invite your friends too. But if you want a challenge or if you don't have any friends, play by yourself. The game is enjoyable in every aspect."

14008,"This is one of my all-time favorites! I love chaotic multiplayer games, and ""Castle Crashers"" fits the bill perfectly as a hilarious ""hack-n-slash."" But I believe what contributes to the game's incredible longevity is how it's very easy to pick up but will take years to master if you're up for the challenge. Like any beloved game, it has a huge following that lead to the creation of a strong and persistent Castle Crashers Discord page where you can learn more about the game's mechanics and various strategies that will equip you to take on any challenge whether they're standard, arbitrary, or ""Insane."" All of these reasons are what makes ""Castle Crashers"" a timeless masterpiece. Grab some friends, and give it a try!"

14059,"J'ai toujours aimé l'histoire médiévale, ces chevaliers colorés, partant en guerre pour sauver des princesses, les libérer de barbares pas gentils qui rotent de l'alcool, oui, c'est bien ça, roter, j'aime ça, on dit que c'était une pratique courante au moyen-âge pour signifier à la tablée que le repas était bon, je sais même pas si c'est vrai, on s'en fout en fait. Mais sachez que ce jeu est une représentation fidèle du moyen-âge, vraiment, des experts historiens étaient sur le coup pour ce jeu.

D'ailleurs, saviez-vous que les daims ont tendance à péter quand ils ont peur et que c'est comme ça qu'il arrivent à prendre de la vitesse? Avant ce jeu, je ne le savais pas, depuis, j'ai atteint l'illumination, je suis à deux doigts de rentrer en communication avec Saint Gaben lui-même.

Le titre du jeu est mensonger quand même, ça parle de casseur de châteaux mais tout ce qu'on fait, c'est diriger des chevaliers courts sur pieds qui tapent des barbares courts sur pieds, où est mon casseur de château? Ptetre c'est une métaphore dire que c'est toi qu'est casseur de château parce que tu fous le boxon dans la région? J'sais pas, j'ai jamais été subtil dans les figures du style.

Comme dans la vraie vie, plus que tu tapes, plus que tu ramasses de l'Xp pour taper plus fort que tu gagnes encore plus d'Xp, c'est du génie. Des fois, t'as même des chevaliers, ils ont des pouvoir de ouf, genre, t'en as un, il balance de l'eau gelée (glace) d'autre de l'eau évaporée...ha ouais non, ça ça marche moyen, mais en vrai, c'est bien, puis on les reconnais vite, le rouge, par exemple, il balance du feu, parce que il est rouge comme le feu...c'est pratique pour les gens peu subtils, ils comprennent vite du coup et moi j'ai toujours été que pour que on ouvre le jeu, même au gens qui pensent avec leur caca. 

La musique est trop bien, il parait que ça fait danser les gens en fauteuil roulant, moi bof, ça marche pas (lol), je suis toujours dedans, mais au moins, je peux dandiner du bassin grâce à cette bande son réalisée à base d'instrument électroniques à base d'électricité. Et ça, c'est révolutionnaire, oui Marise.

Si vous n'avez jamais jouer à ce beat'em all, un peu court, très con et plein de mignoneries, vous devriez, c'est un classique du beat'em all, souvent trouvable pour moins cher qu'un kebab, que de toute façon, vous pouvez plus acheter, donc acheter plutôt ce jeu."

One of the most charming games I've ever played. The setting and plot is fun and I love the visual storytelling, which doesn't throw a bunch of dialogue in your face, but still manages to show you exactly what the plot is. There are so many visual gags to enjoy as well and the first time I saw that one deer (you know the one when you see it) is burned into my memory as one of the funniest things I've seen in a game. Well worth its very cheap price tag."

14190,A fun game if you are playing with your friends
14191,great game
14192,very good
14193,"An entertaining game that for all intense and purpose is worth your time if your looking for a solid beat'em up to play solo a game through, but definitely improved with others to play this game. Just like any other beat'em up, there's a lot to see and fight with you and your friends to tag along. So if you have the spare fortune, try it out, but if you can grab friends to try this out, I'd highly recommend this. You guys can surely have some fun doing a couple runs, especially with the new characters you'll unlock. However, it can get easily repetitive, so again best to play this one with friends to tag along."

14199,"A great beat 'em up with RPG elements, clean animation, multiple modes, characters and weapons all making up for a very enjoyable experience, especially with friends. Kinda repetitive and not as fun if you're playing solo, though. 8/10"
14200,Very fun game. enjoyed it with my friend
14201,"Gather round fellow Castle Crashers because this game is full of fun, this game is so good from art to story and it is a game for almost everyone, if you don't have this game, well what are you waiting for!"
14202,best game in the universe. Its fun to play wiht friends it cured my cancer and also cured my dogs depression. This game crated life and also created god. Best game ever
14203,Great entertainment
14204,played this with my mom for the first time when it came out on XBLA. Playing it again now with some friends with remote play together on PC and am still loving every second. Buy this game.

14219,"Great game, fun and funny at the same time, many hidden items and events. Best to play with other people or at least local co-op. (for fun, not that it can't be done solo) Online Co-op is viable, you might not find many online lobbies but, I guarantee there are people waiting to see one hosted and there are forums where people ask for players. (last I played that is... for whatever it's worth)"

14228,Awesome little game that has lots of game time with friends.  Bought this originally on the xbox 360 years ago and now on pc.  Looks and runs great on PC.  Worth looking at with online play or local play.  You can buy a key for literally a few dollars online at a key shop like most older games on steam.
14229,epic game
14230,"Good game overall. Played the story once and that's just about it for me. Unless you plan to max out all the characters' levels and stats or to unlock all characters for some slight different in the game play (magic ability), then there's a reason for replay. 

Better to be played with friends."
14231,awesome funny multiplayer game! I hope there will be a second one
14232,Amazing Fun CO-OP Game To Play With family an friends highly recommended
14233,nice game
14234,yes
14235,epic sword go swing
14236,remeber when your older sister brought an older man over and your father tries to kill him for sleeping with his daughter and your mother was screaming so loud that the dinner china cracked so you locked yourself in the closet and youre playing with your medival knights figurines in the closet and they finally vanquised the cat trapped in the cloest with you saving the princess from doom and living a life of happiness something you wont ever have cause you just heard multiple domestic violence and assault charges happen outside the door so you worry you may end up treating your family like that but its okay cause this game is fun and makes you forget all that
14237,Such an amazing game. I love every aspect of it
14238,it's funny and great

14249,Very Fun!
14250,very nice
14251,"Castle Crashers... a great original game that came out during the Xbox360 / PS3 days. Very fun to get a squad goin with the boys, brings back good old memories. Pretty fun game. Similar to Little Big Planet."
14252,Epic gamer
14253,It's so Fun.
14254,"Now this game is actually super awesome. The fun, light mooded gameplay is a nice change in a world full of ""realistic"" open world games. You can kill literally anything with whatever weapon you what. You'll be killing a giant cat, after runinng through a forest being chased by a giant BLACK bear, after seeing a whole village be brutally slaughtered. Women and children screaming for their lives as you joytfully walk past. But honestly its kinda a rip of Assassin's Creed."
14255,onr of my favorite games ever
14256,"Castle Crashers is a lot of fun. There are princesses to save, bad guys to beat up, and grouchy friends to play with. Would recommend, although I wish they would give the in-game instructions with PC controls instead of X-Box controls because sometimes it gets confusing."
14257,this game is super fun and the story is realy cool

This game is AMAZING!"

14262,amazing simply a classic
14263,"I like that you can  choose  your weapons, but I wish that you could play as the wizard. Me and my dad played together, insane mode is a good way to level up. My red knight is level 99. You should play this game!"
14264,"This game is very good. You should absolutely try it. You can play with your friends, but it can be easily played alone. Just give it a try.

Getting more characters just makes you feel some sort of happiness inside that i just cant explain. One of my top 5 favorite games for sure. The 15 dollars is a small price to pay for a huge amount of fun
14273,The only castles i crash are sites of cultural significance in Iraq regions

14301,"As someone who remembers the days of Newgrounds and grew up experiencing what amazing creators that platform fostered, ""Castle Crashers"" was not just an excellent game that embodied a lot of the internet flare and homegrown artist vibe and humor when it came out, but it also validated these more independent creators with by its sheer release along with the likes of ""Alien Hominid"". 

""Castle Crashers"" is an excessively charming and humorous take on the ""side scrolling beat 'em up"" genre that seemingly died out quite a long time ago on consoles. Although arcades and newer indie games that sought to revive the genre were still retaining the soul of these experiences, not many were being produced all around because the industry had moved on for the most part. Long gone were the two-dimensional limitations of the past, and so a continuous wave of three-dimensional barely limited releases have been ushered in since. This is not a bad thing intrinsically, as genres need to die out to make way for a focus on more evolved experiences, it just is a shame certain genres are forgotten by the passage of time and shoved away for the few who remember them fondly enough decide to make a modern game reviving the feel of these arcade phenomenon. When these standout creators formed The Behemoth, it was such a amazing statement to someone who grew up with these creators, and luckily, the games they have made are so much better than they could have turned out.

Instead of ""Castle Crashers"" being a pandering waste of time that served as a ""Hey, remember this genre?"", it became a unique and very quality take on the genre it is born out of. The comedic and crude nature of the enemy design and simple yet striking world built here come together to put the passions of homegrown artists that have made themselves known through the relatively new platform of the Internet and translated that respect garnered into a tangible product. Although games inspired or made by creators on the Internet seem commonplace nowadays, going back even a decade or so, it was not the same landscape. As with most new ventures, society as a whole will be less susceptible to accepting artists in a new field or on a new platform just because of their ignorance to it, but thankfully projects like ""Castle Crashers"" and others in the same vein have set a precedent and model that others followed in, and so many more Internet creators are given a chance to shine and make a living out of this newly available venture. The gameplay of ""Castle Crashers"" isn't anything new, but it does what it does so well and has a true lack of things dragging it down, making for a beautiful homage to a genre that has been laid to rest in the grand scheme of things.

I would urge anyone who is a fan of this type of game and more modern Internet charm and humor to give this game a shot. Although now it is over a decade old, it is still a fun and engaging side scrolling beat 'em up that gave life to an old genre and pumped it full with loads of comedy and creativity not seen in even many modern games in general. It is a breath of fresh air no matter when you play it, and is enhanced even more when you get the chance to play it with friends and family.

[RATING: 8.0/10]"

14338,"Well, I do like this game, but it's just I have played it over and over and over again. This game back when it was brand new was a legendary work of community-art. From Newgrounds, this game came to fruition, truly giving the slogan meaning, ""Everything, by Everyone."" I don't recommend it if you are looking for a lot of different stuff happening, as it becomes bland rather quickly.

In terms of a rating? I'd give it a 5/7."

14368,THIS GAME IS FUCKING AMAZING BUT ALSO AN ABSOLUTE PIECE OF GARBAGE
14369,"I remember playing this on console when it originally came out on Xbox 360 and absolutely loved it. I say the replayability aspect of the game makes it. There are many different characters, all of which are a hoot to play as. While still a great game singleplayer, it's meant to be a shared experience. I've spent countless nights on this game with friends. However, the game can get a bit dull after a while, and would wildly benefit from more minigames. Fantastic game, 9.5/10"

14384,no not enough boom
14385,"Past all these years the game for sure become classics of a genre. Even when the sheer amount of what is happening on the screen can at times be overwhelming, overall simplicity and authentic game style keep player engaged from start to finish. When played with friends, this game is even more enjoyable."

14392,If you are a fan of scat or inflation this game is a no brainer
14393,"Honestly, this is one of the greatest games of all time in my opinion, but that's mainly just because of the nostalgia factor in my case. Words cannot describe how much I love this game. Funny, fun overall, and a general fantastic game."

14399,A great game to play on your own but is most fun with others. The game is wacky at times. Would recommend to a friend. Very easy to enjoy.
14400,"Visually and auditory a very appealing little game. As a single-player experience it gets repetitive quite fast, although the game designers change the environments and enemies laudably. The game's humour also spices up the gameplay to a new level. But the slashing and bashing of enemies becomes monotonous after a while, and I don't really see any point of playing the game through a second time (unless one plays the hardcore mode). 

As a multiplayer game, this game is lots of fun. But considering its low price, even a dedicated single-player might find this game a very good bargain."
14401,loved it packed with adventure with the amazing bosses and characters
14402,"Great gameplay, very fun and the music tops it off,"
14403,I remember how much fun this game was back then. im looking foward to alien hominid invasion. i've bought the remastered edition on the Playstation 4 to play with some friends

    [*] The hand drawn art is nice.

    [*] Small skill tree to put points in four different stats, allowing players to specialize a little.
    [*] Revival is interesting a pulse heart beat system.
    [*] Amazing boss battles.
    [*] Rescue the princess from the boss, but only after a duel to see who gets her.
    [*] Simple control scheme, intuitive enough.

14417,"This is insanely fun. On the face it's not something I would normally play but with the couch co-op aspect it made it perfect to play with my son and I am VERY happy I did. I think co-op is where it really shines and highly recommend it for that.

Side note: I streamed some Behemoth games with my son and had the pleasure to interact with their staff. They are very delightful and a team I am more than happy to support. Their love for the game and the industry is very apparent."
14418,"Rating 2/10
It is only an adventure game in campaign mode. The rest is challenges. The only fun part for me was the back off barbarian challenge where you have to position yourself constantly to not get smashed at all. 
But on a serious note the game is meant for console platforms so you will waste your money if you play with a keyboard and mouse.  The game mechanics is very rigid and basic and hard to figure out as you only play with your keyboard. It needs some bug fixes and I’ve read about that your game progress gets lost on the servers if your account is inactive. Multiplayer is dead and the game can only be fun playing with your friends.

All in all not worth buying the game in my opinion. It should be a free to play game.

14461,"This game just never gets old. I played this game long ago when on Xbox 360, and they some how changed the game and still made it perfect. I recommend this fun indie game. It's fun by your self but even funner with friends. Theres multiple characters you can get by beating the game. or buying dlcs that cost only 1 dollar. Ive played this game for years now and it still seems to amaze me. theres also hardcore mode for players who feel like the game is easy. if your looking for a cheap game to play with friends. this is the game here."
14462,its extremely fun
14463,"not my type of game

14464,"best fun party-game I have ever played no cap.  Deffo recommend for those highschool or middleschool sleepovers.  Four for the most fun, 1 is just boring.  Play with friends and win :3"
14465,I first played this game on Xbox Arcade in the early 2010's and god has the game still held up. I didn't even remember that it's from 2008. Please if you have the cash get this game. 6 hour story for me and my friend to beat it but there's still hard mode and many other characters to beat the game with. Please and I mean PLEASE play this game and anything else made by the Behemoth makes. They make some of the best games from my childhood.
14466,"this is a off brand story mode of alien game
"
14467,fun game yes is

14483,"I've been playing this game since I was 5 years old. I am 16 now. I never managed to play it for about a 7 year period, then I got Steam and realized that it was on here. I purchased a 4 pack and shared the game with my friends to share the amazing experience, every level is nostalgia and some levels are very challenging. It's a great game, I would seriously recommend playing it."
14484,"You know what?

I've played this game for over 8 hours now and haven't crashed one fucking castle.."

14493,You have to play this game with friends.
14494,"I love castle crashers, and even though it's already been so many years since it's release I always come back to enjoy Dan Paladin's iconic art style. It is and will always be one of the best party games to play with your friends. Highly recommend. 15/10 game."
14495,"Divertido, engraçado e dinâmico, Castle Crashers é um ótimo jogo para se jogar sozinho, ou em grupo. Permitindo até 4 participantes, jogue online ou localmente com seus parceiros e dê risadas com a história divertida desse jogo 2D. Uma aventura e tanto, cheia de bonecos para você testar diferentes poderes e escolher as melhores armas. Leve com você um bichinho de estimação durante o caminho e tenha habilidades extras com a ajuda deles. Explore mundos diferentes e encare chefes peculiares. Desenvolva suas habilidades e suba de nível, ganhando poderes novos! Castle Crashers é recomendado para os jogadores que buscam diversão de forma simples e, ainda assim, bem feita."

Lots of hours of enjoyment, lots of replay value. Very fun.

Buy on sale if you want to wait for price, but I feel like even at full price this game is well worth it. You will get many hours of enjoyment out of it, and also, couch coop is not dead!"

14570,get some friends and play it.
14571,fun
14572,"Castle Crashers is an extremely well-made indie beat-em-up, and an excellent co-op game. In it, you and your friends go through different landscapes and hordes of baddies, leveling up your unique knights, finding and unlocking new weapons and pets.
It's simple, yet effective and extremely fun. The combat isn't complex but very punchy, and the game is very cheeky and downright hilarious at times. It's not a long game, but it's definitely replayable by its nature.

I strongly recommend this game for anyone who wants to have a good time with friends. It's very easy to pick up and play, and is very fun and replayable.
 Don't get this if you'll play alone, or if you just don't like beat-em-ups."
14573,"Such a classic game, but is so much fun along side your friends. After playing this game again it reminded me how much fun this was as a kid, and my opinion still stands for this game for it is still fun now. I would prefer to play it with friends, but I probably would avoid playing it solo just because I feel you can enjoy it more with your friends. I would recommend this game only if you can play it with others, it makes the experience more enjoyable!"
14574,It good
14575,It's very fun when played with friends
14576,Copa Samsu. Pretty pogchamp.

14584,"played this game start to finish a million times, 9/10"
14585,"I've had WAY more play time that what is displayed.  This game is TOTALLY WORTH IT!  You can get it bundled with Pit People or Battleblock Theatre, both great titles as well.  Lots of unlocks, some easter eggs, and a classic NG bit of comedy.  Tons of fun with friends on the cheap and is up there with Risk of Rain in my book!"
14586,game good
14587,god tier
14588,"I had this game on Xbox 360 for years. it's still super fun on PC. get it if you love 2D platform games, also its quite funny lol"
14589,yes
14590,"This game was my childhood, im 17 now, but when i was a little boy i remember going over to my friends house, sitting down, grabbing my cheeto dust covered controller, and playing my Blue Knight. Even though those good times may have passed, i can still play this great game on steam, and though it may be a little different without friends, it is still a great game, no matter what anybody tells you, in this age of Modern Warfare, and Fortnite...sometimes we just need to play a good old classic, and this is that."
14591,Great fun.
14592,"game good. one thing to learn, exp is gained when you hit something regardless of whether or not its dead so if something is close to death, keep it in the air for extra exp. also play with friends"
14593,fun and keeps you ocupied
14594,"For a game that was originally released in 2008, [i]Castle Crashers[/i] has held up remarkably well as a satisfying co-op beat-'em-up. It features a large number of unlockable characters, animal orbs (companion creatures), and weapons, offering great replay value just in trying out new builds and playstyles.

The art style is as delightful as it was over a decade ago (and perfectly scaled up on the ""Ultra"" setting for modern displays), and the music is timelessly catchy. Playing this after having played through the original back in the day, I felt like no time had passed at all.

My one major gripe about this game is the autosave system. Progress is saved only when the player returns to the map. I've lost progress half a dozen times within the past 2 weeks due to online co-op games randomly dropping in the middle of stages. This is especially bad where several of the stages flow into each other, increasing the amount of progress that can be lost by a sudden drop. In a modern game, this would be unacceptable.

What about gameplay balance? I can point out one obvious design issue: [spoiler]Agility[/spoiler] is [spoiler]absolutely busted because it provides both offensive power (faster, longer-range, more damaging arrows) and defensive ability (faster movement speed allowing for better evasion)[/spoiler]. But that aside, the various characters are interesting to play. There are player guides that claim some characters are worthless, but I don't believe they account for all possible enemy and co-op situations. Same with the animal orbs: for example, [spoiler]Sherbert[/spoiler] is widely regarded as the most useless one, but [spoiler]he lets you jump at the perfect height to efficiently clear the final stage[/spoiler]. Situational usefulness is still usefulness.

As an aside: it's best not to think too hard about the story (an all-male roster murdering their way through varyingly culpable factions/civilisations to save four googly-eyed damsels who reward them with kisses). The narrative hasn't aged well. For what it's worth, I don't believe any of it was conceived in ill will; it was merely a product of its time. I only note it here because some of it can be jarring to a total newcomer.

That all said, this is a fine game that has provided me many hours of enjoyment, despite the flaws I've pointed out. It's not as fun in single-player, so definitely play it with one or more friends for an engaging co-op experience."
14595,"awesome sauce, reminds me of when i was a little kid spamming buttons on my xbox 360 controller"
14596,I have played this game for a long time on PS4 and now that I have played it on PC it is just that much more fun. The game takes nothing to load and is a great fun game overall.
14597,amazing
14598,Wonderful game 11/10
14599,"gg
"
14600,"I believe this game's legacy speaks for itself. It's a classic beat 'em up, with wit, humor, and simple fun. You can spend a lot of time exploring different characters and their abilities, lending the game lots or replayability. Some of the humor is pretty low-brow, such as the pooping deer, but you can't deny that it's funny. Most importantly the gameplay is consistently engaging, and difficult enough to offer a challenge, but not brutal enough to impede your enjoyment. Highly recommended."
14601,Good game for price
14602,"nice, there is possibilietis to play via one pc/tv with friends"
14603,"This is a great game but i think it's a bit of a challenge for me, not in a bad way though, because i like challenges. Overall, I think it's an amazing game to play."

14608,I honesty didn't think I would like this game. It had some gross parts in it. I got it to play with friends and had a blast! Ignored the grossed parts the game play the fun I had with friends was amazing!
14609,"The music theme and controls are good. But some of the levels were very difficult especially the sand, and water round. The rounds were very interesting. But there can be more significance for the animals that follow the castle crashers. You also need to give more options to choose colors of the characters or the outfit.
The bread power can be better whist fighting against enemies like whenever the big fat soldier comes, even the sandwich portion makes it very arduous. I bought this game and its a great couples game."

"
14627,"Wow...Castle Crashers is just as good as I remembered it to be, I've not played this in a while, since my old Steam and Xbox Accounts were hacked. I bought this game on this Steam Account just today (as of posting this review), because I just wanted to play this masterpiece of a game again. I was 4 Years Old when Castle Crashers was first released. I played this for the first time on Xbox 360 when I was 8. This game is one of the games that got me most into gaming, Castle Crashers literally changed my life. I've played hundreds of hours on the Xbox 360 version, I've gotten every character, gotten them all to Level 99 (Yes, including Hatty), and I've beaten Insane Mode with all characters (Again, including Hatty), gotten all Animal Orbs, gotten all Weapons, and gotten all Achievements. And I intend on doing all that again but on the Steam version this time. This game may be 12 years old now, but it's still just as good as it was when it was 4 years old. Thank you, The Behemoth, for making this absolute masterpiece. This is literally the best Indie-Game I've ever played, along with Alien Hominid and Battleblock Theater. This game is just about perfect. I give it a 10/10. This game was my childhood, and I intend to make it my adulthood as well. This game is the best, I was so happy when The Behemoth released Castle Crashers Remastered on Xbox One...I bought it immediately, and I was so happy to replay the game again, but in a more recent form. Better looks, better framerate, and a new alternate mode ""Back Off Barbarian"". Thank you, The Behemoth...for making this game. I will forever be a supporter of you guys. Which is why I'll be buying Battleblock Theater and maybe Pit People on Steam at some point as well. I HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone who likes to just sit back, relax, and beat up some Barbarians, or annoying Thieves, or even each other in Arena Mode. Speaking of Arena Mode, that mode is PERFECT for bets. Example: Best 2 out of 3, loser pays the pizza delivery guy. Super good mode for bets. That's usually how I used to do a bet with my friends. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!"

14660,"That Volley ball level is the worst level I've seen in a long time. ""Highest Rated Xbox Live Arcade Game"" Bullshit. You have to be pixel accurate but the controls and 2D aspect of it makes it damn near impossible. Fuck this game, Glad i didn't pay for it."

14711,"Castle Crashers is very fun and exciting. There's many bosses to fight and the game becomes more difficult the further you progress, providing more challenges and more excitement. The only thing that I'd say is that it will become boring when you've completed the game with all of the knights as there is nothing new to do but other than that, I would highly recommend this game."

"
14771,Dank game to play with friends and mob.
14772,A classic that I've playing since I was a little kid. There are many playable characters which vastly increases replayability. There is also a nerve-wracking insane mode that you can only unlock after beating the game. The game's humour is something that brings a smile to my face. The simple cartoony artwork is great. And I honestly think that it's in my top ten favourite games that I've played. I'll give it a humble 8/10.
14773,good

14830,Zero playtesting; why would they add multiple chainlocks in a TIMED situation? It's absurd and quite tasteless.
14831,nice game
14832,"Fairly fun and fast paced (PC players be advised, while you can change your key binds, the default keys are clumped very close together you will ""fat finger"" your skills every time you go into combat). Would highly recommend, even though I had trouble remembering all (if any) the combos!"

I tried for three times but it always shut off. I think I may cannot complete this game forever. QAQ"
14874,M1
14875,"Absolutely one of the funniest game to play with friends! Cooperation mixed with competition make you and your friends spend hours on this game without being bored of it. A lot of short different levels that you can use to fill half an hour of gaming with friends, or to spend an entire evening! You keep progress with your knight in your solo game and in hosted games. Recommended!"

14879,v fun
14880,"[i][h1]Lookin' for somethin' classic, casual fun to play with friends? Castle Crashers could be the right one![/h1][/i]

So basically it doesn't have a specific story, players just need to get their objectives done by [i]smacking[/i] all the way to save em' abducted princesses and retrieve back the [i]magical gem thingy[/i]. Actually not just smacking but also can use magic and archer, effectiveness relies on player's stats. Plenty of characters to be unlocked, gameplay is pretty short and simple but the game itself has really good replayability. What makes the game more interestingly fun is when you play with a pack of [i](silly)[/i] friends, fooling around at the same time. Solo play is enjoyable too. Nonetheless it's a well made game and is filled with great sense of humour!

Highly recommended!"

14894,"The perfect game to play with a group of friends. The fun story line and unique abilities/weapons will keep you entertained for hours on end. While it is not necessarily the newest title, it has aged very well and is incredibly hard to tell it came out so long ago. It is best played with an xbox controller, but maybe that's just me.

The art style in this game is beautiful and the music in this game is incredible! The story was very easy to follow and the game had great humor. Castle Crashers is also great to play with friends or family. This game is 100% worth the buy in 2020 and I without a doubt give this game a 10 out of 10 rating. One of my favorite games of all time.

15008,"I have played troug it about 6 times, and every time is's something different. all the different characters have a unique style, and I personally really like the design of the game. The gameplay is fun. All the enemies have a different personality and the game has some really funny scenes. The multiplayer is really easy to set up, and it's even more fun with some friends, but you can also play alone."
15009,Fun and short game. Took 5 hours to beat the game

15026,ㅁㄴㅇㄹ
15027,Its like real life: You fight with your friends for some girls who just give you max kiss and then you never see you again.
15028,"i think the other games of the behemoth are better.
this just feels like spamming buttons."
15029,Pretty good game to play with friends
15030,"If you like to kick ass and take names here is your one stop shop for a can o whoopass.  Solo or with a group of three, this game is da shiznit.  Enjoy freezing your enemies in place, lighting a group of thieves on fire, shocking the shiz outta the competition and poisoning the pizzle outta zombie teddybears, and much much more. 
i love this game. When my family first bought a 360 , many years ago, castle crashers was a hit with everyone in the household. Seeing this game here for PC has brought back many delights and the whole family will now be playing again for many hours. i totally recommend for anyone who just wants to have a little fun."
15031,I liked the fact im able to play multiplayer with up to 4 people
15032,"fun shit for a lil nig
"
15033,"Nostalgia, a great company and a whole lot of replayability. This game is one of the classics and if you played the original you will love the game again. Best played with friends. Plus THANK GOD, they fixed the connection problems that would occur all the time."
15034,:)..
15035,"i always have an itch to play this game every once in a while, its great with friends or solo, and is pretty simple to master. the gameplay is fair and fun. classic"
15036,"Great game some of the bosses are kind of shit though (I.e the corn,the ice fellow and the final boss when he does the meteor spam) pretty good though and a fun time with friends"
15037,"Castle Crashers Is one of my personal favourite games ever and maybe the best. this game has lots of fun bosses, funny jokes, lots of fun and gore. This game is really fun on your own but way better with friends. You can have several hours of fun on this game with friends I highly recommend playing it. And I do agree that this game will not be for everyone. But in my total opinion it's really fun and definitly deserves your money. If you aren't really into these hack and slash games then if you like platformers then I recommend Battleblock Theater made by the same people but is a platformer and is just as funny and fun with friends. If you like shoot em ups Alien Hominid is the next best thing also made by the same people this one is older but a sequal is coming out and also if you get these games you also get Hatty and The Alien as playable characters in Castle Crashers. One thing is also that Alien Hominid Isn't Co-Up but the sequal will be. But Highly suggest picking up Castle Crashers it pretty much the mona lisa of games"

15059,epic
15060,"This game is honestly amazing. 

For everyone that used to play games on Newgrounds back in the day, this should almost feel like a nostalgia trip to you. The game has a lot of humor, fun gameplay and great visuals and animations.

This game is basically a hack and slash sidescroller, with a bunch of different weapons to choose from, as well as different magic for each character. While the game isn't particularily hard, it's always nice to find enemies that are  resistant against certain types of attack and work your way around that. If you're good and know how to play these types of games, you can easily finish the story in about 3-4 hours. However, the replayability is great and the extra gamemodes are also a lot of fun.

It's also a game you can play with up to 3 friends, which makes the whole journey even more fun.


Seriously, give this a try, it's definitely worth it."

15122,its pretty good yeah
15123,game toooooooooooo goood
15124,"funny music
"
15125,"Castle Crashers is a very enjoyable game that took me by surprise on a ""free weekend event""!
The game is a 2D fighting game very focused on co-op player, that support both couch co-op and online co-op! 
Visually it is pretty OK with a very colourful game, but if you think that this is a kids game think twice. It is a bit gory, with blood and ""dismemberments"" happening all over the place.

Overall a very cool game experience especially with friend, but I like to point that, despite the fact that the game was on a free weekend event at the time when I reviewed it, I could not find any player to play with. So take this in account because it might happen to be playing it ""solo only"" due to that."
15126,"IT GOOD

15135,
15136,yeah its good
15137,finished the game in 8 hours i can totaly recommend you to buy it :)
15138,"nothing. ,asterpiece"
15139,my favorite game of all time
15140,fun
15141,"it is a good game. i love the graphics,the gameplay,the map and especially THE WEAPONS. hint: use a controller while playing because is easier"
15142,Good game
15143,"
I played hundreds of hours of this game on Xbox 360. It's simply a masterpiece.

Pros:
Fantastic soundtrack that keeps you immersed.
Easy to learn gameplay with some skills to hone.
Fun character selection that keeps you coming back.
Fun story to follow with lots of little cut scenes.
Many, Many hidden things and easter eggs that make levels replayable.
Lost of weapons and helper pets to give more variety to the standard gamplay.
RPG style level system with magic!

Mixed:
The second harder playthrough has enemies with like 20 times the health. It's fun with friends but single player is just.. well just imagine hitting every bad guy about 100 times, and bosses like 1000 times. It gets annoying.

Cons:
The grind in late game is way to much. You don't get xp fast enough to ever get a character anywhere near level 99. If you did, I give you props, but I'm not spending 200+ hours on one character to get them to 99.
Story can be beaten pretty fast if you don't do any extra stuff or you don't switch characters often."
15144,
15145,still good
15146,Trash game. Nothin special about it other than decent net code. 8 years later and after defeating the 2nd boss and rescuing the princess' the game bugged and we couldn't do anything but roam the arena. No idea why people like Behemoth other than they had good experiences on Xbox 360.
15147,Amazing Cool !!!!!

15193,its gay
15194,crashes constantly ;(
15195,One of the best games I've ever played :))
15196,"This is one of the first games I ever played with my kids (the other being Dungeon Defenders), I've also played its local co-op with friends and family on my living room TV... in that context you're looking at a great game, though maybe not in any other. Too me Castle Crashers is synonymous with local co-op, THE local co-op game, and good for hours of hilarity and hack-n-slash mayhem."
15197,very fun
15198,"When you first start, I'd recommend going to the keyboard or controller settings to see what each button does, and write them down in case you forget mid-fight. Play through the campaign first, then move on to the extra game modes, the campaign arenas, and unlocking and maxing out every character that you can unlock."
15199,:)
15200,Castle Crashers is an awesome game to play with your friends! while on your own its a good game to pass the time but i highly recommend asking your friends to purchase this game as it is a blast and you can enjoy some funny moments!
15201,"fUn WiTh FrIeNdS, its great i love it."
15202,"Played Remote Play with my peeps and it was honestly the best. Except the last level, that was hard. And disorientating. We could have done without that. 

Now we need to play it again with our new characters."
15203,",
"
15204,fun
15205,Probably the best beat 'em up.  My best friend and I logged tons of hours on this across xbox and steam. Definitely worth a try.
15206,"If you dont like early 2000's newgrounds then this game simply isn't for you. But if you do then this a game that takes everything great about those games and animations, even including some familiar music from some of the greatest flash games and animations. Castle Crashers while being over 10 years old at this point, still holds up. The gameplay is almost infintly replayed with the amount of optionss you can to do with a charater with the level and magic system. Also anygame that has 4 player co-op is atleast good in my book. I'd rate this game an 8/10 but for me personally is 10/10 just based on how much time and fun i had on the game over the years on the 360 and steam verions."
15207,yes
15208,good game
15209,Delightfully silly and lighthearted!
15210,Really fun when you get used to it. Easier with keyboard even though it says remote is easier. 10/10 would recommend
15211,yes
15212,bruh
15213,"That's the last turd outa you, Dues Vult!"
15214,I think this game is over all fun to play with friends and i just hope they are able to another fun game just like this one but maybe like a part 2
15215,A very fun game to play solo but way better and more fun with friends.
15216,What do you expect? A Bad Review. Your Wasting your time. Just buy the game
15217,"Played mostly on 360, bought it on here."

15244,Yo this shit slapped when I was a kid and it slaps even harder in quarantine thanks Covid-19
15245,Castle Crashers is a very fun game made by Behemoth! I think thats the name. Behemoth has many other great games to choose from! And also Castle Crashers a medieval themed game with really good graphics! I totally recommend you to play it!
15246,"fun with friend
"
15247,ITT IS FUDGEIG DISGUSTING
15248,This game is great. I used to play this game when I was very little. About 5-7. I really enjoy playing this game again years later!
15249,Bear shid.
15250,"Castle Crashers is a cartoony beat em up game. You can control several characters that you can level up. You also have to collect pets and new weapons to make your character more powerful, strong or faster. Unfortunately this game doesn't require skill. At least in the campaing. For me and my mate the playing experience was like this:
1.Play 3-5 levels
2.Get stuck
3.Go grind
4.Repeat

I'm not againts grinding. I love the disgaea series for proof. In this game the grinding is the definition of button mashing. It feels like a chore. This was my main problem with the game. It's really a shame because this game has a lovely art style, good sense of humour and the game is fun when you aren't grinding. This game has potential to be good but the end product is boring.

Pros
+Artstyle
+Gameplay(when not grinding)
+Good Co-Op
+Good sense of humour

Cons
-80% of gameplay(grinding)

15257,very fun
15258,"This is simply an amazing game! A little bit oriented to farming, if you like such a thing (I do! n.n)."
15259,A fine example of couch beat 'em up
15260,Awesome game for friends and even still really fun on your own!
15261,Yoes
15262,"This game is everything right about co-op and beat em' ups. With funny world building, linear yet rewarding character leveling, unique and creative bosses, and more than enough fun with friends, this game embodies what makes playing a game with friends fun. There isn't too much point to making many characters since the only difference is the color or effect of the magic and the kind of arrows you shoot on a small handful of the roster, yet I still find myself making a new one anytime someone I know wants to play it. Great game for its price, a must have when it's on sale, and a classic The Behemoth  game."
15263,Game is fun especially on harder difficulty and other players but if you're not into redoing an entire game for a new character it's probably not for you.

and if you think not id like to see the 
game better then it."
15306,"somehow managed to get updated to steam, then updated again.  Still just as much fun as it was on xbox 360.  great alone, great with friends.  The standard perfect balance of beautiful art, great humor, and engaging gameplay that you'd expect from a behemoth game.  I've played this game much more than the 33hrs that steam attests to at this time of writing, since i played so much on the 360 before it got beautifully ported to steam, and i still play it, since it runs quite well (like most of the behemoth's games) on a laptop, bringing good fun to pretty much anywhere.  gameplay is great fun when you have no idea what you're doing and just as much fun when you're juggling across the map on insane mode."

15346,"This experience really sucked for me, but it didn't start out that way. Actually, playing the game through for the first time was an awesome experience. 

The game controls really well, art style is fantastic, and humor is pretty well done. I don't particularly like poop jokes as I feel like it's cheap humor but this game made me literally LOL over some of these hilarious moments, particularly the one's going on in the background. Just such a charming game for a beat-em-up. 

The problems began with the whole reason I bought the game in the first place. The online multiplayer. There is this horrible input delay that happens in every single session I've tried to join. 

My friends and I had to resort to local play which is fine but... not why I bought it. I combed through the forums to solve this issue and found that most people recommended that we all lower our settings, but this never worked. Also-- why should I lower my settings just to use the online feature? Just makes no sense to me. Anyway it gets worse...

So most of the time I had to play this game solo, which is fine because as I stated earlier the game was a blast during my first initial play through so no problems there, but after that? Oh boy...

So you unlock characters every time you beat the game. I actually loved the idea of this until I realized that the characters more or less function the same. Different magic attacks sure, but controls, combos and everything are all the same. As a matter of fact they felt a lot less like characters and more like character ""skins"". Okay that's fine, but why on God's green earth do I have to level up each character ""skin"" individually? And there's 25 CHARACTERS ""SKINS"" to unlock too, and the only way to unlock most of them is to beat the game MULTIPLE TIMES!!!

Anyway so I'm a Completionist, this is what I do. So I end up just completing the game a thousand times to unlock them all. Super. Duper. Boring. Experience. My God. So now I've finally unlocked them all and I'm ready to get the last couple of characters in intense mode. Oh boy...

So in intense mode the devs basically double damage and HP for all mobs and bosses and call it a day. Great right? Sounds like a decent enough challenge to me.

However at this point the game goes from being a beat-em-up and now turns into a juggling simulator. You now must unlearn everything you've learned in order to master this ridiculous new juggling technique cause its basically the only way you're getting through intense mode, and I do mean... THE ONLY WAY.

The game never prepares you for this by the way, never teaches you about the technique or anything. You learn by basically getting your ass hammered in so bad that you go online to seek a solution to the problem.

So literally you are jumping into the air, smacking a goon and pressing XXYY CONSTANTLY, juggling them until they die. I know I make that sound easy but it really, really isn't. The problem is that mobs have SO MUCH HP that you will be inputting this command a million times per stage, also counting all the times you die trying. So more like a billion.

This literally killed the game for me completely. I do not get angry at video games. I lose, I go home, I come back for more later. It's simple. This is the first time I actually got legit enraged over playing a game like this, and its not even like I'm a stranger to doing this kind of thing. 

I got double S Rank in my DMC 3 days so this is nothing new to me, but the difference between DMC3 and this game is that DMC3 was actually a fun system where you're constantly switching attacks and abilities to rack up a mean combo. Very, very fun. This? You're doing the same shit over and over and over and OVER again till ad nauseam.

So I finally, FINALLY play through this ridiculous juggling game up to the point of getting the final character ""skin"". I remember unlocking that ""skin"" after all the work I put in and it didn't feel good at all. I didn't feel overwhelmed with relief or have that sense of accomplishment I felt in most games with steep challenges. I just felt meh.

 I then had a decision to make. I'm at the end now. I can continue juggling my way through to the end boss and beat it or I could walk away from this game forever.

So I looked up what you get once you beat intense mode. No achievements, No extra character ""skins"",  just an icon on your character selection screen changing to a different color. Wow. Just wow. Needless to say, I chose the latter.

I reflected on my experience and a lot of the time and work I put into this game and realized it wasn't worth it. None of it. My hands were killing me, I swear I'll need glasses after staring at the God damn screen so long watching my character juggle away and it was all just not worth it. I walked away from this game with the one feeling you never want to feel after completing a game. Regret.

I wish I hadn't gone down the rabbit hole of this game. I actually loved the first experience so much I committed to buying the rest of the developer's game roster, but this game left such a sour taste in my mouth that I don't think I'll be going down another road with them. Perhaps I would after extensive research and pooling over hundreds of reviews. Maybe... but this experience sucked so much that I doubt it.

If you are a casual player and mean to only turn this on if you have some friends over that's fine. I'm sure you'll have a blast. Anything multiplayer is a blast. Other than that I just don't recommend you go down this rabbit hole like I did.

If you want a little bit more of a visual representation of my experience then go on YouTube and check out the intense mode play throughs of this game. If you see that and think that it's your cup of tea then go for it. Otherwise if you are anyone else and ESPECIALLY if you are a completionist like myself. Avoid this game. It's just not worth it."
15347,its LIT!
15348,"Simplistic side scrolling beat-em-up with smooth gameplay (except my computer is a potato, but it runs fine) and funny moments. I definitely recommend playing with friends!"
15349,G00D
15350,"good game
"
15351,Its fun and addicting
15352,this game has been out for years and for me has never got boring. i like the monsters and level design for the style. Its soundtrack is great as well.
15353,"Bosses are so much fun. I had a blast with my friend, we played and beat the game in three days. It was incredible."
15354,it do be good
15355,funny poop is ever ywher hahahhahhahahhaha
15356,if u ever liked castle crashers before you will like it now becuase its still the best
15357,"Brings me back to the days when I played games on newgrounds. It has all the thing you'd want, like poop jokes, and some more poop jokes, and .... there's a lot of poop jokes
Pretty fun to play with some friends once or twice, but that's about it.
Grab it when it's cheap"

15366,gud game
15367,Amazing
15368,Goog
15369,"lots of content and lots of ways to play, definitely worth the time and money if youre looking for a long experience"
15370,"Saw the reviews and YouTube videos of the game and decided that it looked fun. Bought the 4 pack and played online co-op with my girlfriend. Everything was running smoothly and we were having fun until the stage before the swimming stage (where you fight the catfish boss); framerates dropped from 100+fps to 2fps. We are using RTX 2060 and RTX 2080 ROG laptops and have really fast internet connections. Tried lowering resolution to 800x600 and turning off v-sync but it doesn't solve the problem. The game would always run fine for the first few minutes then start to lag extremely badly. The game is great, the laggy online experience.... not so much.

TRDL: Local play good, Online play bad."
15371,"An amazing co-op game
it will take you a while to get everything unlocked in this game. more than I did!
but if you enjoy playing with friends then you will like this one"

15376,bruh this is literally my favourite game of all time please make a sequel or a new update.
15377,It's has a really cute style and makes me nostalgic in a way Newgrounds made me feel during the flash game craze phase
15378,Is Good.
15379,great
15380,I recommend this for the first 5 tries at the game... it gets repetitive in the end so don't overdo it whatsoever. I love this game but god it needs mods or something more fun to do
15381,"fun, mildly frustrating in the way that makes you try without raging"
15382,"Let's start from the beginning.
I personally love Newgrounds, it's such a fun site to play games or just chill, and i grew up playing flash games there. So when i heard that they were also creating games for bigger platforms i was astonished and almost immediatly bought all of their games, but, i decided that it would be better if i just played each one of them 'till the end.
And OH BOY i LOVED all of the games ESPECIALLY this one, it is one of the best Beat 'em up games i've ever played, the single player is very good, but the part that really stands out it's the multiplayer, i had such a good time playing it with my friends, i still remember how tense we were at the end of the game in the final bosses, and when we finally defeated all of them... it was just too sweet, it was a magical moment that i'll always remember.
I truly recommend this game, it is one of my favorites, not because of the history or things like that, but because of the ability that the game has to creat moments that will live forever in the hearts of every single one of the people that played it, at least, that's what happend for me, hopefully it'll happen for you too.
My last massage, enjoy ; )"

I grew up on the Xbox Live Arcade version of this game. This version is a port of the Remastered version that came to the Microsoft Xbox One. One thing that I would like to see come back is the ""All You Can Quaff"" game, it might just be me though.

Overall, it's Castle Crashers. 

85/100"

15439,"i used to play this as a child basically I’ve been wanting to share this recipe for a long time and I am not quite sure why I haven’t. This is my grandma’s brownie recipe, with no alternations, just hers. I think part of me wanted to keep it just to us because recipes are special…grandma’s are special.

I just visited my grandma with my two daughters and mom and although it was quite the adventure…staying in a hotel for the first time with my 3 year old – of course she got the stomach bug and got sick in bed and then in the car on the way home. The pool at the hotel was of course “out of order” so we were stuck with not a lot to do other than Target dollar bin art stuff (thank God for that though!). With all this said…it was hard, tiring and a little stressful but at the end of the day my 100 year old grandma got to see my girls and we took pictures. It was wonderful.

Since then I’ve been thinking about my grandma. She was the kindest person, funny and loved to bake. I can only hope this is how my granddaughter will describe me someday. Her life has been full…she has loved, been loved, STILL LOVES, ate good food, had the cleanest house in the world, and she made the best freaking brownies.

My mom makes these all the time for her get togethers with friends. They always get devoured and she always gets rave reviews. She laughs because we have eaten these brownies for years and we knew they were good, but I don’t think we realized just how amazing they really are.

First, they are the thickest brownies you will ever eat. The batter is crazy good…so thick and full of cocoa flavor. You will definitely want to lick the spoon for this one.

I love when you spread a batter out and it leaves the “spreading lines.” It just emphasizes how good these are actually going to be.

You bake this delicious batter for about 30 minutes and let it cool until it’s warm then….

they’re topped with the most unusual delicious frosting that sets up like fudge. This is what makes these brownies stand apart from any other brownies out there. The frosting seals in all the goodness and adds a thick layer of additional cocoa flavor and sweetness.

You end up with these – a moist, thick, fudgey brownie with a cocoa fudge icing.

I mean…these look pretty damn good.

Then you bite into one and everything is right in the world. I take a bite of these and yes, I taste an amazing brownie, but I also feel the love of my grandma.

These are special and I am happy to share them with you because I hope they become special to you, too."

15480,"A very, very good game. I'll keep it brief since I'm tired:

Major Pros:
- Waterflame Soundtrack
- Satisfying combat
- Lots and lots of characters
- Sickass level and enemy variation
- Nothing makes any sense story-wise
Major Cons:
- Waterflame soundtrack
- In some cases hard to tell if you're on the same height as an enemy (rarely a huge issue)
- Holy shit enemies with bows are annoying
- A few easy ways to cheese combat if you find them
- Nothing makes sense story-wise

Overall a ton of fun, really well made, and content-rich."

15483,"I need more people to play with xD
I do recommend this game for other reasons, too. One big thing is it's one of those games if you have a controller is easier, but just as much fun to do with a keyboard. I've played this game for much longer than 13 hours, but on xbox. The artwork is pretty cool to say the least. The DLC knights aren't too expensive and if you don't have the money for them then hone up your skills mate, because you'll need to destroy some peeps in the arenas.
Once you level a character you get points to upgrade those peeps. A friend and I would take up ""Classes"" where you each choose a position. Ofc we know what classes are. You have that friend who plays archer, one who plays tank, one as the melee DPS and one as the mage, or level alone and balance that all out(You can keep the princesses to yourself then as well *Wink Wonk*). 
Just a super fun button-masher. Get it already."

15512,I rode a backwards shitting deer forwards
15513,good sauce
15514,"Play it with friends, and you're bound to have a good time!"
15515,"  Let's start from the beginning.
 I personally love Newgrounds, it's such a fun site to play games or just chill, and i grew up playing flash games there. So when i heard that they were also creating games for bigger platforms i was astonished and almost immediatly bought all of their games, but, i decided that it would be better if i just played each one of them 'till the end.
 And OH BOY i LOVED all of the games ESPECIALLY this one, it is one of the best Beat 'em up games i've ever played, the single player is very good, but the part that really stands out it's the multiplayer, i had such a good time playing it with my friends, i still remember how tense we were at the end of the game in the final bosses, and when we finally defeated all of them... it was just too sweet, it was a magical moment that i'll always remember.
 I truly recommend this game, it is one of my favorites, not because of the history or things like that, but because of the ability that the game has to creat moments that will live forever in the hearts of every single one of the people that played it, at least, that's what happend for me, hopefully it'll happen for you too.
 My last massage, enjoy ; )"
15516,"This is my favorite video game ever. I have played a lot of this game, and am a huge fan of the games made by the behemoth. This games humor and art style couple together so well. It is much more fun if you go in blind, with a group of friends that you're prepared to lose.  I say wholeheartedly that this game is a masterpiece. This game also pays homage to Golden Axe which inspired the gameplay mechanics. 10/10"
15517,10/10 if you don't like it then that sucks you should've bought something else
15518,very fun

15559,"Castle Crashers is set in a fictional medieval universe. It begins with four knights attending a party in a king's castle. During the party, a dark wizard arrives, stealing a mystical gem and capturing four princesses. The king sends the knights to retrieve the gem, rescue his daughters, and bring the wizard to justice. The knights encounter several enemies along the way, including other knights, multiple encounters with a cyclops, thieves, a giant ""catfish"", factory workers, monstrous oceans with ninja pirates, and alien invaders. As the knights progress they succeed in rescuing the princesses, and ultimately the journey culminates in a final showdown with the wizard. The knights emerge victorious from the confrontation, having defeated the dark wizard, rescuing all of the king's daughters, and recovering the mystical gem. The knights then ride the reclaimed gem through several empty battlefields on their trip back to the castle. At the castle the king brings one of his daughters for one of the knights to kiss, her face veiled throughout the entire game. As with previous levels, the players fight to the death to claim a kiss from the princess. However, when the winner tries to do so this time, the princess is revealed to be a clown that blankets the screen."

15638,"I've recently started playing this and beat the game twice so far after playing this game on the Xbox 360,
this game is actually really good and i'm just wondering if other people genuinely play it"
15639,"Good hack n' slash, all in all. Entertaining enough, and good to play with friends."
15640,Very Good Game To Pass The Time
15641,"Super awsome and epic game, fell like a pro and pretty much everyone can play it. Much Much better with friends. love it!"
15642,"i used to play this on my xbox 360 it good ,
"
15643,its awesome
15644,Boring game. The first move you learn is all you need to get through the whole game. Just jump and juggle the enemies.
15645,Is 100% hilarious and will keep you laughing till you cry. Its got good content story line and a straight forward plot. There are also lots of secrets to be found to. 11/10 would recommend controler
15646,i loved this game as a kid and to this day its very fun to play 10/10
15647,"If you don't have castle crashers then you don't have steam

15648,"Very Fun Game tho If you do want to play it, Play with friends as it is better with friends"
15649,"A classic for years now, and for good reason. A fun beat-em-up, with great humor and art. If you want a testament of how this game's humor is, it made me laugh at a poop joke. Three times."

"
15656,"It's a pretty good beat 'em up game to play, but it can be very difficult if you're playing with no friends. The enemies are pretty tough to beat, and some of the bosses can be very annoying and tedious without friends. I highly recommend this game to anybody with a group of friends that enjoy addictive beat 'em up games."
15657,"the game is so fun, great for multiplayer, now with online couch co op and its so cheep. buy this game now. do it! do it nowwwwwwwwwww!"
15658,"It good
"
15659,Great game but don't play the spaceship level with someone who has a bad internet connection.
15660,Amazing Gameplay but can be hard
15661,"Honestly, I was never much into these types of games growing up but I wanted to get back into gaming so I could play co-op games with my girlfriend. This game is a blast to play solo but I assure you it's even better with a buddy! Challenging but never overly frustrating, this game has excellent gameplay and mechanics and is funny and quirky enough to play with your girlfriend or a child who is mature enough to handle the cartoon violence. One of my favorite platformers and an absolute must play for all gamers!"
15662,"good
"
15663,"i love this game, this was my childhood, although it being 2d and many glitches still one of my favorite games of all time"
15664,"The game is an oldy but a goody, the art is amazing, great story, insane mode (for advanced players) is very fun, there is no reason why you should not buy it, $15 is a steal. it is kind of repetetive but I barely ever get bored of it and I have 518 hours played. And I highly encourage to play with your friends. The controls are weird and difficult to learn, but you adapt as you go. Highly recommend for all people."
15665,decent timewaster
15666,"Lots of fun, occasionally really hard. I would purchase Castle Crashers again, if I needed to."

15677,"its good
"
15678,the best game i play
15679,"Honestly a blast - the add-ons are not required, but they add some neat characters.

Great for groups of up to 4. I have it on multiple consoles and it's super re-playable (especially with groups).

Groups are not required for it to be fun, but make it exponentially more fun.

Achievement hunters be warned... the achievements are all fun (and easy) to get, except: 
--40 arena battle wins (not a fan of the in game online pvp requirement - requiring someone to excel at the pvp mode to get 100% achievement progress - which sucks), and...
--Barbarian time mini game survival time - some people like games that reverse controls, but I don't see how that adds to castle crashers as a whole and I don't see why it is an achievement - it sort of tries to force you to play the (opinion) only bad section of the game (aside from the pvp achievement requirement)."
15680,"Super fun game to play with friends or a significant other. Great visuals, funny jokes, and engaging gameplay and infinitely replayable"
15681,i got 2 words. buy it
15682,it is good but bad exp gain system

15688,"This is one of my favorite games ever to exist, You can pick it up for 2 to 3 bucks usually on sale, This game is fun for hundreds and hundreds of hours, without getting bored. There are 70+ enemies, weapons, pets, and more, Tons of characters all with different spells, and weapons. And its twice as fun with friends. There is even an insane mode that makes all enemies 10-20 times stronger, and believe me it is a gargantuan task to do. And requires the strongest knight to complete. This game is a must for any new steam users looking for a fun time, 10/10."
15689,SUPER FUN
15690,"very good

no?"
15691,"Es divertido de jugar, Co-Op de hasta 4 jugadores, una vez terminado se desbloquea un modo Hell que es bastante mas exigente que el modo normal..."
15692,nice fun game to play by yourself with no other people whatsoever. also the only strategy for this game is to max out defense and strength to be an unbeatable tank of destruction. magic users are losers.
15693,Great game to play with friends!
15694,this game is one of my favorite i love the bosses i love the combat the only thing that would make it better ( in my opinion) there could have been more quick time events cuz i sometimes i get cought off guard when im in the clash event (other than eating a sandwich because thats most the only thing when im facing another giant) so yea 20/10 would reccomend (english is not my first language excuse my grammar)

15737,ePIC
15738,"yes
"
15739,its great other than how hard the bosses are
15740,SICK GAME
15741,"Fun to play with the younger cousins who still think poop jokes are funny. Personally I hate stat progression, and it's pointlessly annoying that everyone needs to pick up an item if they want to use it later."
15742,"its a great coop game you and your friends can play and laugh at everything and simply HAVE FUN
it worth buying"
15743,"Helped bring me and my dad whom I rarely see together,helped me make some friends. it also kept me entertained. Highly Recommend this game"
15744,"A fun hack and slash with a nice skill tree that keeps things interesting/adds replay value. Lots of stuff to collect too. I played this via remote play and I will say that especially frenetic areas do not do well on a poor connection. The final boss was almost unplayable with all of the movement on screen. It would be great to see a lo-fi mode that cuts out some of the background animations, I think that would have been really helpful.

It's a little short, I would guess around 7hrs of play time until the ending playing with 2 players. There is a lot of replay value though as it will take you at least twice as long to collect everything and level up multiple characters. Difficulty is just right. We had to grind a little bit but never for more than 15mins or so. Plus you can buy potions to make things easier if you find yourself stuck.

One thing I will say is that this seems like a very bro-developed game. All of the characters you play as are (presumably) male (given that they smooch the princesses several times) and there is a lot of crude boyish humor. Not to mention the game is about saving a princess/retrieving a power stone for a king. Just turning some of the princesses into princes could have fixed this."
15745,Perfection.
15746,"Played the classic version on Xbox 360, played the remastered version on Xbox One and now I am playing this version on Steam. This game is THE SHIT! It is an amazing RPG/Coop game that gives you the freedom to choose between different elemental knights/minions with a compelling, funny and dynamic story!"

15748,"Very unsatisfied with this game, as it was clearly intend for children.

15790,"It's pretty enjoyable, though the replay-ability gets a little boring after a while. Much more fun with friends."
15791,its aight
15792,"Great game! A simple side scroller that has really unique art styles and great gameplay, it has some really great comedy and combat. I also like how they put leveling into it, like an rpg, where each character has a different ability, from poison to necromancy. Another unique feature is that there can only be one of each character, so only one person can be ""x"" character, and other players will have to be ""y"", ""z"" and so on, this allows roleplaying as each character can fit a certain task, such as healing, tanking, etc.

9.3/10 Overall (In my opinion)"
15793,its awesome sorry im not good with reviews lol grab some friends and play this tho
15794,"YES,YES,YES,YES,YES. I played this game for such a long time on xbox and i loved it and PC make it easier  to play.  This game is by far the best xbox game and a good pc game."

15910,"The feeling I got when I played Castle Crashers on Pc was amazing! On Xbox 360 I must of had at least eight thousand hours on the game because I would do all-nighters with my friends or by myself while listening to music, sometimes I didn't even realise I had been playing for six hours straight. After pulling an all nighter to get a certain character or get to level 99 as soon as I would wake up I would go round a friend's house and play it again sometimes the same character. My favourite character would either be Thief or Royal guard. I wish they would add the king because my friend usually played him and so I never got a chance. I remember Castle Crashers really trained me in the art of button spamming because of playing 'all you can quaff'. I loved Castle Crashers then and I love it now as well. I still play it today and Battleblock Theater and I am looking forward for that new cop game Behemoth are working on. 

P.s add alien hominid to Steam with trading cards because within the first month I would have one hundred hours on it because I absolutely loved that because it was pretty similar to Castle Crashers."
15911,"If you and your friends like having fun, you might want to think about playing Castle Crashers together."
15912,Best game made ever ngl
15913,Hands down the best game I've found on Steam.
15914,very fun
15915,"beat the living shit out of your friends and whatever else gets in the way, 11/10"
15916,buy it
15917,"After the forest and volcano levels it for sure has a difficulty curve, at least for casual gamers. But super fun in general!! Love this game."
15918,A fun game to play with friends
15919,good funny
15920,It's a classic. You have to own it.
15921,This is a favorite multiplayer game that I seem to end up playing over and over again. Wonderful for couch co-op play with friends.
15922,Yes
15923,"This game is great, it's so much fun played with friends! Lots of different fun characters to play as, all with their different abilities. There's also DLC if that's something you're into! I've played through the game multiple times and I still always have a good time. It's got humor and a very appealing cartoon art style. It's definitely a go-to of mine if I'm looking for something to play with others, both local co-op and over wifi which is so nice! You can also choose to use your keyboard or a controller.
The only thing I wish was different was that all enemies had a small health bar above their heads, and not just the major bosses. Sometimes it can be a little frustrating using an enemy as a punching bag, thinking their dead, only to have them get up and shoot an arrow in your knee. But that's honestly just a small complaint, nothing that would make me not want to purchase or replay the game!"
15924,This is one of those games that's fun for the whole goon squad
15925,super fun and enjoyable game!
15926,amamzing

15934,This is a classic couch co-op game.  Controls are excellent.
15935,"I have owned classic game for years now, I also had it on 360, it is well worth it, great gameplay, great fun. It would be cool if the developer made Castle Crasher 2 and if they brought Alien Hominid HD to Steam as I used to have it on 360 n it was great fun."
15936,Nice games for friendships.
15937,"good play

15956,This game has a hilarious campaign that when done with friends make it so much better. It is certainly not that challenging but no one said this was Dark Souls. :)
15957,"originally played on x360 with my brothers, absolutely worth it for a fun game with a good deal of replay value"
15958,fun for all ages short but amazing i reccomend it to all
15959,Good piece of shit game
15960,"Fun and exciting. Lots of stuff to do and if your looking for a game to try and fully complete,  this is the game for you. It can be fun by yourself, but it is most fun when playing with friends and family."
15961,"such a time consuming game i love it
"
15962,uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh good game
15963,yhes
15964,"I've played this game on Xbox 360 and PC.  If you need a beat'em up game, this is it!
Solid responsive gameplay, controller support, and a quality of life tweaks implemented for PC.

My only complaint is that there hasn't been a sequel or level adding DLC."
15965,fun video game
15966,
15967,Hard to finsh the game by yourself
15968,"A very fun arcade style game for spending a few hours gaming with friends. The more people you can play with, the more fun it seems to be."
15969,Glad I spent my childhood playing this game...
15970,"Last time i played this was 2017, and this was the very first thing i got on steam, im near the end but i couldnt beat this one boss, and since then i havent played, but now i think i want to get back into it!"

15981,BEST GAME EVER.     Only 3 words that describe it.
15982,"ufutfd
"
15983,"hard but really fun. The ""Final Battle"" was really intense and fun. My cousin and I spent 9 hours on this game. I highly recommend this game. :)"
15984,Very fun and great combat system
15985,"This game could keep you busy for hours and even after you've beaten the game, you can still collect all of the weapons and pets that you already haven't. Would like to see maybe dlcs or something for this game even though it's been years."
15986,"seems like a dumb game but if you enjoy a chalanging cartoonish game then i would highly recomend it, but to get the most out of the game you are going to have to play it multiple times"
15987,"The Game is fun with friends, but by yourself can be kinda boring tbh."
15988,I've been playing this game since it first came out on the Xbox 360 and I love every second that I play it. Not the biggest fan of beat em ups but I couldn't recommend this game more to someone just looking for a fun time.
15989,.
15990,fun with friends
15991,played this on da xbox live arcade and wooo its so good to be back baby
15992,all around good game

"
15994,"Very good, reminds me of my childhood. Really fun game with nice controls (for controller)"
15995,ton fulp pleasc call me back
15996,"I 100% recommend playing this game with friends over playing it alone. It is a fantastic game all the way through, especially if you have never played it before, but friends really brighten up the whole experience. If you don't have any friends to play through it with just hop into the Castle Crashers discord where you can probably find someone to play it with. It is also a fun game to speed run and it does not take too long, it is around a 1 to 2 hour speedrun so it is not too hard to get into."
15997,"bruh just buy it, its got mad storyline lmao"
15998,Best game ever
15999,This game made me very happy
16000,"very fun, play with friends and you will have a good time"

16002,A Fun Game to Play with friends.
16003,"If you're into chaotic bullshit, this is the game for you. Also, fight for your waifu's against your friends. 

P.s. It's essentially Power Rangers: Medieval Times edition."
16004,"i only have one complaint
-you can't smothly transion into combos"
16005,very good game i cant stop playing
16006,a
16007,good
16008,"Highest of quality in my opinion, got me through some dark times."
16009,My second game on Steam. Thought the gameplay got repetitive pretty fast. Still a blast to play with friends. The art is cute and quirky like in any other The Behemoth games.
16010,This game is so donkey please buy
16011,huh?
16012,Good
16013,"Very good game

16019,refreshing art. very underated
16020,Really fun to play with friends

16022,It's a classic multiplayer game that consoles all alike should have.
16023,YES
16024, d werr
16025,E
16026,"Just a really well made game. Hours of fun. If there are any negative reviews, ignore them and get this game!"
16027,"gay
"
16028,"it's boring
and it's difficult to tell where you are on the z axis leading to some strange shit
like my gal and I were playing arena and our swords were passing thru each other but I guess our axes (as in the plural of axis, not the plural of axe) weren't aligned so
nothing was happening
it's just kind of comically bad"
16029,"Good game, a bit challenging but very fun, if you are looking for a fun game this is what you are looking for.
"
16030,I like it but its pretty hard
16031,fun with freinds
16032,"Encountered random glitches when playing local multiplayer, where one character may get stuck out of bounds and nobody can proceed, or character gets stuck and no buttons register actions (though you can pause and navigate the menu just fine). Not fun to spend 10 minutes on a level to have it glitch this way, then restart it and have another glitch occur. Coupled with janky controls and endless enemy health, it just really isn't too enjoyable, outside of the artstyle and humor."
16033,BUY IT! IT'S GOOOOOD
16034,good game
16035,Probably my favorite hack and slash game
16036,a great game with colorful and fun characters. there are enough aspects to keep you hooked for a significant period and there is still a lot of a challenge even after you beat the story
16037,Good Medieval Arcade Action.  Level progression is kind of hokey when switching knights but other than that no major flaws.
16038,Really good.
16039,"This game is so fun and I keep playing, its funny, Its bloody, it has crapping animals and lots of other stuff but what more could you want"
16040,its a fun 2D sidescroller the game i love the mechanic when you beat a game you can unlock a character if you havent completed the chain yet of that classes unlock characters and insane mode is really difficult but good
16041,This game is a lot of fun.
16042,"good jobbba
ysawe"
16043,gr8 and classic game. But you should probably get a controller because pc controls kinda suck lol
16044,"like good game

16045,its a classic at this point
16046,"""Im a deffinition of a bandit took her heart from out yo hands still aint sayin **** some new killers in my circle you done ran with it like this dirty .38 this ***** ill damage"""
16047,This game was a big highlight of my childhood and I really recommend picking it up. Really fun to play with friends and also fun to play solo. The music is amazing and the story is really interesting and funny at the same time. BUY THIS GAME NOW
16048,Fun game to play with friends

16050,very nice
16051,"uhhhhhhh i poopie my pants and i found this game, and then my poop disappeared after my poop had magically disappeared i went over to my friend landon, and i told him to eat  a cock, now after that i took a plane all the way  over to my friend spooks house and i slapped him silly as he was jerking off in his bed. Now then I flew all the way back over to my house, and I went to my brother I told my brother that he was very fat, and that he needed to go on a diet. after i told him that he needs to go on a diet he went up to me and he called me very ugly. so after that i showed them all this game, and then we all become friends. then after that, we all fell apart and we killed my brother. then we met a man called sam, and then we did the same. after that my friend landon is going to buy another friend named cars op this game. this game brought my entire friendship together"
16052,its good
16053,"Good game, very fun."
16054,"This game is a fantastic time killer with great fun. It's amazing as a couch multiplayer or now even with friends online, thanks steam update!"
16055,"This game is totally the old arcade style TMNT, or Simpsons 4 player game.  Alot of fun with a friend or 3, I beat it with a duo and had a blast.  Very re-playable as you unlock weapons, pets and characters to play as you go through the game."
16056,Amazing game with diverse characters!
16057,"Castle Crashers is from the same creators of alien hominid, the art style is the same and gameplay is similar. I like how the game is simple but difficult, it's an hack and slash type game with some DLC to keep ppl coming back for more., 4 player co-op and battle arena. I definitely recommend the game and give it a 4.5 out of 5 starts."
16058,"use tilt controls, it works better"
16059,best game to play when bored
16060,Still one of the best party games ever.
16061,A great pick for fans of the beat-em-up genre. A must-have in any chaotic gamer's library!
16062,THeres only 1 castle. But whatever i guess...

16066,"insanely fun, brings me back to my child hood days"
16067,very good game for how old it is and would recommend if you like adventure fighting games in 2d definetly a grinding game

16072,"This game is a blast to play, whether you are by yourself, or you've got friends to play with you. I beat it with my best friend not too long ago, and I've started playing through the other knights to unlock more characters, and I'm still having so much fun!"
16073,its reeee fun with lots of poopin animers though
16074,"noice
"
16075,Yes
16076,"This is a super fun beat'em up with rpg mechanics. 

Good things:
-Game is providing you with the way you want it to play. You can rely on melee or magic or both, or use agility/archery. There are a lot of different characters with different abilities and a vast variety of weapons that gives different stat bonuses. So it feels like it has some good replay value. 
-Each boss fights is unique in their own way and designed in a very entertaining way. This game makes you want to play boss fights over and over again. 
-Art style is really funny and music is very pleasant. Even dangerous and dark environments have a way of making you cheer up. 
-Game doesn't force you to grind for anything unless you want to collect all achievements, you will need gold to buy stuff from various shops which are a little expensive. But if you aren't a completionist and just want to get through the game you  will have enough gold to buy only things you want. You also won't need to grind XP as game provides you enough to finish the game.
-There are a lot of enemies and I don't mean only bosses, even there a a lot of trash mobs and they are all unique and have different powers that will make you deal with them in different ways.
-Overall game difficulty is very well balanced and easy and casual, however only one boss fight was a bit tougher than other ones for me (you can always ask a friend for help if you are having difficulty, like i did with one boss :P)

Cons:
-Although game provides you with a lot of different characters, many of them have same abilities and even different ones look pretty much the same. 
-Trash mobs have too much HP. If they were challenging to beat it would actually be fun but they are very easy to deal with and makes the game feel a little repetitive, meaning a lot of button mashing. 
-It is a little short.

However fun aspects of this game is overwhelming, so I think you should definitely try this game, especially if you like hack and slash games that won't torture you with difficulty."

16092,"I first got this game on console 5 years ago and I was surprised I found myself playing the game recently, spending hours again on story mode beating the game over and over to get new characters. Every time I start the story anew with a different character, I realize that the mesmerizing graphics and outstanding plot never gets old. 

For those who are looking for games in the hack and slash/beat em up genre, I strongly recommend this game but do be warned, it is HIGHLY addicting. You will fall into countless hours playing storymode and before you know it, you would have beaten it a little more than 20 times!!!"
16093,Fun the first go around. Boring after then.
16094,The castles have been crashed
16095,"Love it, been playing it since forever. Never gets old"
16096,It is a good game you can play two players if you have a controller or something ya its good if your looking for an adventure.
16097,YES SUTE
16098,"Amazing game I re purchased when I saw that it was 3 dollars. Classic xbox 360 game I used to play with friends and family members. The game is just how I remembered if not better! I have already completed the game with 2 characters, and reached level 99 while also completing insane mode on one of the characters (Red knight). Overall, an amazing game nonetheless even if there isn't a sale going on."
16099,this good. yes
16100,"Normal mode is quite easy when you learn how to play but then you enter insane mode and you start wondering can you really play.

I liked that challenging way of learning new way to play to play insane mode"
16101,"Muito bom o jogo, ele é leve e bem divertido. Por ter comandos simples, a gameplay é bem fluida e rapida"
16102,I honestly had a fun time playing!!
16103,1 of my favorite games of all time
16104,"y,hj,jkcm"
16105,SO much fun with friends. The game has a perfect leveling system and the art is very original. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for hours of fun smashing bad guys with a good dose of comedy accompanied by your friends.
16106,it fun
16107,adrian crashers
16108, I honestly never saw this game until I found it on sale. I probably wouldn't have considered buying it otherwise. At first glance it doesn't seem to look like a game that costs over 10 dollars but after playing it for a couple hours I think that the price is perfect. It has very good controls and enjoyable combat.
16109,Woop
16110,verry good to play alone and with friends ;D
16111,"It's good, play it."
16112,I liked this game and it has a lot of funny jokes and good animation while also being a pretty good beat them up fighting game.
16113,"twas good
I liked the game style, and it wasnt too difficult nor easy
I would recommend this game to other players"
16114,"Truly a classic game. I would personally say it is my favorite hack and slash of all time and not just because of nostalgia from xbox. 

The concept is simple. The King's daughters get taken and it is up to you to go rescue them. Throughout this journey you fight plenty of cartoony enemies through different areas and fight some interesting bosses with a lot of humor along the way. You can unlock A LOT of characters but it would take a lot of effort and replaying the game but that isn't necessary to get all of the achievements. If you have nostalgia from the 360 days I would say definitely pick this game up and live through the fun again especially with friends. If you like a beatem up style magical adventure I would also recommend this game. If you are none of those things I would still recommend picking up the game on sale. It is a lot of fun even with one playthrough by yourself. 

The only downside I can give this game is the segments between bosses can get repetitive. Enemies vary by their magic and appearance but they all have the same melee which is what they do most of the time and when you fight enemies you are likely to just spam the same xy combos with some magic mixed in for aoe. You can level up to improve your characters and gain some abilities (Like projectile magic or magic jump) but it doesn't change the gameplay loop that much. What will draw you in during these times is the humor and getting immersed in the different areas you got to plus the bosses are very varied in their abilities. If you can't get by that style of gameplay though then the game will be pretty stale for you after the first few areas.

I am still hoping this game gets a sequel because of how much fun it was."
16115,"Castle Crashers takes me way back. When I was a boy this game rocked our world.
We would all get together and play Castle Crashers on Xbox 360.
To pick up the Pc version and play with The controler that works great on steam games now.
its a real joy. I was begging for a game that used the Invader zim artist to render knights in battle.
Could use mods. Some say theres a more realistic looking version in development."
16116,mmhmm yes fun and fun with friends
16117,"Very cool game, it gets better if its played with friends"
16118,Really good game.
16119,:))))))))
16120,Fun time
16121,i crash youre mom
16122,"This game is an amazing game for adventure with friends and solo, however if you like to collect just beware that this game is very repetitive and could get boring at times but besides that its an amazing grinding/adventure games"
16123,⠀
16124,this game slaps
16125,childhood game would pay for hours!!
16126,good
16127,A classic beat 'em up in every sense of the word.
16128,"Quite Good game to play with your gf!
Could say its eazy to start and play and takes some time to master combos etc, the lvl is fun and later on it takes a little harder, on bosses its not that bad but last one was the hardest which is ok, what I mean is the level of enemies is growing with time and progress quite good, its not too hard but takes more work to get it done.
The hide weapons/pets is quite good feature but very hard to find them all and we don't want to check it web lol so we have about 50% weapons and we tried it few times but its getting to boring to do it more.
The most painful is that it takes about 8-10h to finish the game if you are not rushing, and its fuking sad to barly start and finish it next day when you enjoy it. All the weapons, pets could be easier to find and still there are many characters to unlock but damn getting it over again is pain now. Gf: 7/10 and I give 7/10 as well tbh specially we took it in christmas sale so it was worth the money but definitely not for full price."
16129,"It was an ok-ish game but the combat got pretty boring pretty quick. Enemy health felt too high so it took forever to kill the scores of enemies coming at you even though you were perfectly combo-ing them. If you decide to play, dont bother putting stat points into magic past level one and dont put any into range."
16130,MCZ
16131,"If youve never played this game before, you kinda owe yourself one at this point. Classic Beat em up meets classic Newgrounds aesthetic. And with an absolute barnburner of a soundtrack composed entirely of newgrounds audio portal standbys... For real, what's not to love?!?!?!"
16132,it great game really Cool Really cool 2D Game
16133,"Castle Crashers is one of the multiplayer games that are great and fun when you have your family members or friends joining you to play together. The feel is like playing the overcooked game but with weapons, enemies and monsters instead of ingredients and cooking utensils haha. The levels start of easy but it gets harder as you go through it. But nothing is impossible. You can choose your characters which each of them have their own special powers and level them up as you beat your enemy. There are many types of weapons that you can buy or picked up along the way. Overall, it's a fun and fulfilling game."
16134,I love this game its very enjoyable though in certain parts it is a bit difficult. I would strongly recommend this game if it was dropped in price a bit but its still a great game and worth the money.
16135,"Its charming and fun, hard to put down, better with friends but still fun alone. Pretty short story if you grind it out, my friend and I completed our first run in maybe ~5 hours. Much better with a controller but playable on keyboard and mouse"

16140,"Castle Crashers is one of my most favorite games.
It's filled with a bunch of levels and it has its own very interesting story.
Though not many people are playing this game nowadays, It's most enjoyable with your friends, whether locally as a couch party, or just by inviting your steam friends online, But you can still enjoy this game alone by completing the story-line, defeating arenas and unlocking new weapons, pets and characters.
The game is very much worth it's price."
16141,ye bro for sure
16142,👍
16143,So fun. Enjoy with friends and leveling up.
16144,just play for 15 minutes with some friends and you will know why I recommend this game

16146,"Honestly such a fun game, even more fun with friends. I very much recommend buying this game."
16147,"Back in the dim distant past, when consoles were for getting a group of friends over to race, fight, or out skill each other, part of the fun was enjoying a shared space.  Castle Crashers brings this back.  Solo, two or (better) three or more players in the same room, sharing the joy, the jokes, the fun.  Visual gags, easy to pick up gameplay, challenging, and fun."

When I want to play with my friends, I can open the windows and see my friends are online or in game. But I can't click the invite button, I can't close this window by clicking red circle at the left top of the windows. 

By this reason, I can never play with my friends.

16186,"This game was good on release, and in a few years post its release; however, there are much more interesting beat-em ups that have character in a much less overt way. Go play those games instead of this one."

16191,good
16192,"I bought this game during the ten year celebration after listening to the 8-Bit Drummer play through the soundtrack,  CC was a game I was always interested in but didn't have the means to play it for the longest time. I really enjoy everything about it, the beat-em up elements, artistic style, and the music so very much, And since I got it alongside BattleBlock Theater I have been playing as Hatty which is delightful."
16193,חךמילחצךחיךיחל ךחחיח
16194,2009 was nice
16195,It is a really fun game with a good story mode. It would take a bout 6-8 hours to finish 1 Character's story line. But the game has many other game modes to offer which are fun along with if you want to grind it out to unlock all weapons/perks then there are a bunch of characters to play with.
16196,great game even without a controller
16197,i loved this game since i got it from the xbox 360 marketplace!!

No matter who you show this game to, there's some fun to be had. Boss design is fantastic and unique. This game in every area brings something new to the table, it's truly a great experience all around."

16227,This has to be one of the best 2D games on Steam. The amount of humor in this game alone is insane! The animations and drawings are a treat to look at! Please port Alien Hominid HD to Steam soon!
16228,it good
16229,"In my opinion, witch probably be taken with a grain of salt,this is a fun beat them up game with RPG elements."
16230,A great game for bunch of party rambunctious man-children or just chilling with your actual offspring.
16231,An amazing game with or without friends. It includes mini games and many small jokes throughout the story. If it goes on sale again buy a 4 pack and get to playing with your favorite people.
16232,A real classic in smash 'em up games. Really funny and sometimes challenging gameplay. Would reccomend to anyone.
16233," The charming style alone is enough to capture interest. It then keeps that interest by balancing the difficulty to  challenging but not frustrating gameplay. If that isn't enough, the amount of secret animals, weapons, and characters is addicting along with the(all be it masochistic) gamemode called insane mode. It scales the difficulty to extreme measures. Overall, pick it up if you like beat-em-ups with some challenge."
16234,no but actually yes
16235,awesome game and even better with friends

16243,This game is really fun
16244," Incredibly simplistic, yet wonderfully re-playable for couch co op play. Castle Crashers features entry level button mashing based combat that suits the newcomer, and a variety of different magics to keep the player hooked on pursuing the next milestone. With a variety of Characters, Animal orbs, and weapons, Castle Crashers maintains its own aesthetic from start to finish with its zany yet iconic art style. Though the game is now coming on 12 years of age, it still beats many newer titles to the arcade genre. This is an ideal must have for any steam user, however, I strongly recommend purchasing this game on sale; due the fact that it drops to  around a dollar."

I'm still quite a child, but I definitely don't enjoy this game as much as I use to.

SO so much to do, yet I have still not done it.
Unlocking characters, completing the story line, competitive versus, varieties of pets and swords, and more.
This game is great overall but the community is lacking in activity.
I don't want to see this game die out."

16340,I like this game as an action and adventure game!
16341,nice
16342,I have only played on PC for a short time but I have played the game for hundreds of hours on Xbox 360. Its been about 4 years since I last played but I picked it up just like that. Its an amazing game and a great part of my life. This game is worth every penny and if I had to pay 100$ I would buy this game over so many others. Its greatly over shadowed by so many games but is completely worth the buy.
16343,Its fun to play with friends and can be hilarious.
16344,GAME EPIC
16345,"This game is simple, and awesome!"
16346,Greatest game I've played in a while especially with friends I just bought it for a for my friends as christmas presents and we loved it. There are very few games like this anymore.

16355,"People say the game gets boring and/or repetetive and I can see where they are coming from after my first playthrough.
But honestly when I feel like it I can replay the game twice or play it for 6 hours and still not get bored.
The game somehow manages to still be fun for me even after having beaten the final boss twice.
And whenever my friend are on it's even better and we can go with a whole day of just this game and us idiots playing it none-stop.

If you like games with a good art style,
Fun mechanics,
Multiple characters to choose from,
a ""challenging"" difficulty (insane mode is well, insane)
and like games that are not only fun alone but even better with friends

Well. Give this a try."
16356,is good 4 u and frens
16357,One of my favorite games of all time.  Great for single-player and multi-player fun.  It's best played with a controller though.  It's an amazing game with tons of replay value.  A must for anyone with hours to kill.

There's challenge, though none of it is so difficult that it gets frustrating. I'd definitely describe it as casual due to the game's simplicity (I'm not putting that against it, though). I guess the only thing ""negative"" I could say is that it gets repetitive after awhile, but the style, leveling, and unlocking new weapons/pets makes up for that imo. Overall, the game is entertaining, albeit in a simple way."

16471,"Castle Crashers was the game of my childhood (as well as many), and at the time it was a revolutionary game for me! Nowadays, I consider that it has aged well as an old game, although it is not a big deal in the graphics and with a limitation in the resolution it still has its * old * whim.

It is not a challenging game, but rather difficult at insane mode (something a little difficult, just a little). For those who are not used to using a PC, they may suffer.

The soundtrack is very good and goes well in the game environment, the story is simple, but a good adventure story that even reminds parents telling incredible stories to children. I consider movement very smooth and has a simple combat (you can do some cool combo).

Disadvantages: The hitbox sometimes pisses off, if you're not used on playing solo, you might have a hard grindy time, as well as get tiring. 

In short: A game worth testing if you like Beat it up, combat, ""Feudal atmosphere"" and history!"

16480,"I don't know how to feel about this one... The balance is all over the place, it started well until enemies started to abuse ranged attacks, so some regions were annoying while others were super easy, the final boss was pathetic, had more trouble with the first boss compared to him. It's a classic 2.5D brawler with lite RPG mechanics, each new region has a shop and an arena, there are pets scattered around that give you certain boosts and it's best played in COOP. I can only recommend it as it's pretty fun in COOP, not sure I could say the same if I played it alone..."
16481,Excellent soundtrack
16482,pretty cool
16483,"I got the 4 pack, who do I give the game to my friends?

16484,Its a great game to play with friends and you can also play it by yourself if your alone. Its a difficult game at times and its not the newest but its one of my favorite games ever.

16496,solid game that has aged mostly well 8/10
16497,epic game
16498,Castle Crashers was always a fun game to play with friends.  The game controls create awesome hit combos and superb action.  The story is original and keeps you intrigued to keep battling to the end.  The items & weapons you collect each have their own unique abilities to help you along the way.  Overall you couldn't ask for a better game.
16499,"I had fun playing this game solo and multiplayer. It's definitely more challenging than it looks, but it's great. I feel like sometimes the games with the simplest designs can be the most fun and engaging. So many people these days care about super detailed graphics and a really in-depth story, but I care more about just being able to have fun. I recommend this game for anyone looking for a little challenge and a lot of fun."
16500,this game sucks. why is it cartoony? do i look like a kid?
16501,Great game to play with friends!
16502,"Fantastic game, I have played through it more times than I can count and every time is always enjoyable with or without friends, the graphics still hold up and the gameplay is still in my opinion the best beat-em-up mechanics out there right now.

16539,"Castle Crashers is an extremely fun co-op adventure with hack and slash combat with magic sprinkled in on top. The Behemoth games are very funny and this is no exception. It is still an amazing game to play with friends and can be picked up super cheap. 

The visuals and music have aged well and will remind some of us of the good ol' days on newgrounds. There are loads of weapons and pets to try with multiple characters too! 

This is a must play for everyone, it's not too complicated and especially with Remote Play Together as an option get your friends together and play through this amazing game."

16590,The worst game to play with friends
16591,"A lighthearted game that's best played with your friends. The game still holds up since 2012, so that speaks for itself."
16592,It is a good idea to play with your friends😂
16593,Extremely fun to play with friends :D
16594,"Castle Crashers is a pretty fun indie beat 'em up. The best part of the game are RPG elements like leveling up, character choice, and different weapons an animal orbs to make every playthrough a little different. The newgrounds style animation and humor also set it part from other indie games, and gives it's charm. However I do have some complaints. First off the defence stat is essentially required to get any enjoy out of the game's difficulty as enemies hit way too hard without it. The game also has big enemies that have a paradox when it comes to beating them. If you fight them normally, they become incredibly annoying and take way too many hits. However if you use the bread, they become complete pushovers that still take way too many hits and brings the pacing to a crawl. Castle Crashers is a fun beat' em up with cool RPG elements but can get somewhat slow paced and obnoxiously difficult at parts, but even 12 years later, it's still quite fun."

16609,"This game traces its origins back to classic titles on Newgrounds, and rises beyond them for a really fun beat 'em up experience for up to 4 players. It would have been perfect if the main character from the game Dad 'n Me was included. However, we did get the Alien Hominid instead, which is still really cool."

16639,Miau!
16640,It gud

16663,So this review is more so for The Behemoth then castle crashers.  The game is fun if youre able to save. Mine started having trouble saving so i contacted customer support. The first thing they did was suggest i was using an illegally downloaded copy . Their one and only actual suggestion was to uninstall and re install.... which of course i had already done before contacting them.  This game is pretty much useless without the save feature and i will not support another Behemoth game again.

16674,Ive played this game for almost half my life and it's still as fun and hard as i remember uwuw
16675,que buen juego la pta madre XD
16676,"Ironically I ended the year the way I began it: playing a mediocre beat-em-up. 

Castle Crashers main (and only) problem is how basic the fighting system is. You have two attack buttons (a light and a heavy), but the heavy attacks come out as fast as the light ones. There's no reason not to just spam heavy attacks, effectively making this a one button beat 'em up. There are a few combos (emphasis on a few), but they don't do as much damage as just mashing heavy. They don't accomplish anything mashing heavy can't. Their existence isn't justified, and any use the light button would've had there is over before it began.

I'm not asking for heavy attacks to have this long wind-up to them that renders them useless. I'm also not saying that the game should be filled to the brim with a ton of combos to memorize. But if you can't differentiate your two buttons further than one just doing less damage, then you've rendered it effectively non-existent. 

The enemies can be sponges-likely because this game is intended for 4 people simultaneous. I won't complain too much since even single player doesn't take too long to complete. It's balanced decently, but even if you only max damage as you play it it still feels as if the enemies take a little longer to die than they otherwise should. It prolongs my boredom.

In reviewing that other bad beat 'em up earlier in the year, I had a line that is just as relevant here as it was there:

""This game is the most basic sort of return to the stone age you can have. Remember how Double Dragon was alright when it was one of the first beat 'em ups, but streets of rage and final fight 3 added supers and specials and you just couldn't go back to DD? There's a difference between retro games and just retarding game development history and ignoring progress."""
16677,best game in the game
16678,Fun game. Low price. Great value.
16679,foda...

16735,it's ok
16736,One of the best time-eating games ever made!
16737,"A enjoyable side scrolling fighter for all skill levels from beginner to pro.   An excellent beat em up to pass a few hours with.  Nothing flashy, just a good core game."

16748,"Very fun game, especially with friends :D"
16749,Hours check
16750,Very Nostalgic
16751,"This game is ridiculous in the good way. It's always a laugh when you play with friends and the pvp for the princesses are always fun.

My issue with this game is when fighting the bat boss on insane mode is a joke. One hit kill, doing 999 damage. You cannot survive that and you do not get a chance to use a healing potion. It's almost as if the creators wanted you to fail?"
16752,"yeha
"
16753,Worth it... Who doesn't like pinning creatures to a wall in a combo.

16757,I recomend to anyone that loves stuff like Undertale or any pvc games
16758,Epic
16759,Great game
16760,"This game is made to be played with friends, honestly.

It's one of your classic Beat 'em Up games, with the newgrounds touch to it. And it delivers, wonderfully so. It's one hell of a ride seeing you going from killing a pooping and farting bat, to killing a husband in the middle of his wedding, then just after that becoming buff thanks to eating a sandwich."
16761,"In the little time I've spent in this game, I've seen the beginnings of a decent story, and nice combat controls. It would be good to play with other people locally.

I look forward to more adventures."
16762,"fun
"
16763,Great Game! Brings me back to the days when I was playing video games on the Xbox 360!

16766,heck yes this game epic and very fun and also funny and sorta stupid i would very much like to recomend this game to all ages.
16767,Loved the original game when i first played it on xbox 360. The remastered version is way better than i expected when i first played the game. If anything this is my favorite 2d adventure game. Highly recommend
16768,good
16769,Behemoth makes good games.  Funny games.  They do not make sucky games.  All that needs to be said.
16770,g

16783,Uh Oh Stinky
16784,"Castle Crashers is an amazing side-scrolling beat-em-up game, with simple but amazing graphics and design
The story is fun but amusing, the gameplay is fair, understandable, and the mechanics are balanced.
This is a great game to play with 1-3 friends, or by yourself!

"

16834,"I love this game from the fun levels of slaying incraesingly dificult enemys to the hilarous eastereggs and  many unlockable hidden weapons and pets. I started playing this on the xbox and I am thrilled that it is now on steam and downloadible content is available! For whatever reason though, the sound will only work on wired headphones. My two bluetooth headphones both instantly crash when the game is booted up..."
16835,"this game hasn't aged a bit since my childhood, would definitely recommend to anyone with a few friends to play with."
16836,Very Good Poop Very Funny
16837,"madd simple and fun to play 
"
16838,Very good game with character and obvious love put into the game.  But this if you like challenging games that will be super fun with friends

16842,good game pretty fun
16843,fucking awesome
16844,Ye s
16845,so its fun up until the second to last level then it literally makes me want to drink some fucking paint
16846,"Personally, this is by far one of my favorite games on Steam, maybe ever. I like the diversity with where you can go in terms of the start (skill points), and you can win no matter what you do, even if some paths are harder than others. The characters are diverse too, and I like that some are more powerful than others, it makes it my objective to get those powerful characters, and ones I already liked. Other people that I have talked to about this game complain about how it's an endless grind, too repetitive, and how it's not challenging. The first one is accurate, most of the game is a grind, but at the same time, you have the story to try and help you through that grind. The repetivity of the game never really bothered me, even though I understand it is a part of the game that most people really dislike, I just focused on what I was working towards, and why, and that helped me ignore it. The challenging part I sincerely don't understand, if you want  challenging, play insane mode, that's what it's there for. It's not an easy mode by far, so I don't get why anyone could or would say it is, get to the Industrial Castle, you'll see."
16847,Great game but now it's kinda dead because nobody plays it anymore.
16848,"Cool 

Simply yet fun to play, 
Also has a interesting and simply story plot. Knights trying to save all Four (4) princess is something nice."
16849,GOGO POWER RANGERS!
16850,Just a fun game to play with friends
16851,"awesome
"
16852,"Using Remote Control on this for Co-op is absolutely the funnest ive had in a long time. I love this game and steams remote control viewing
"
16853,"I have played this game ever since it came out. I have had it on the 360, Play Station 3, Xbox one, and Steam I enjoy playing this by myself, with my friends, or with my brother and sister. I have recommended this game to so many people I can't count, I always find my self playing it every couple months and thoroughly enjoy it. I wish they would make a #2, but I should be grateful they remastered it and gave it attention <3 The Behemoth."
16854,Fun.You can play with friends but you always have the option to play alone (if your forever alone)and is a great game that is easy to understand how to play and the controls are easy to learn (and change them if needed)you can play on pc and on most consoles.the price is worth it.
16855,i had all the unlockable characters in this game on my xbox 360 [cuz buying king and necromancer was allowed]
16856,"F u n

16857,GREAT GAME!!! REALLY ENJOY PLAYING

16859,This game is just a lot of silly fun. The game is well explained. The controls are simple enough to learn. There is nothing to hate about it.
16860,I crashed that castle like I crash my cock into your Grandma! BEEP BEEP! Out of da' way! Cock comin' through!
16861,"Highly recommend this game to anyone of all ages. It's extremely funny and silly while maintaining an entertaining and addicting story line. It has tons of collectables, such as pets, weapons and characters making the game hard to put down. 10/10 this game is amazing."

"
16884,"Yo, VIP, let's kick it!
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
All right stop
Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance
Bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less that the best is a felony
Love it or leave it
You better gain way
You better hit bull's eye
The kid don't play
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead
Yo so I continued to a1a Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it!
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Yo man, let's get out of here
Word to your mother
Ice ice baby
Too cold
Ice ice baby
Too cold too cold
Ice ice baby
Too cold too cold
Ice ice baby
Too cold too cold"
16885,"Funny, original and engaging game. Bleeds design, 9/10. Took a point off for a save bug which erases your progress."
16886,Pretty fun with friends.
16887,"This game is really good to just sit down chill and play a great game. It works great as a solo player game, it's multiplayer is a bit shaky but is still fun to play with friends. For people whose internet connection is just not the best it is really good cause internet connection doesn't matter and if you have like 500 ping it runs beautifully in solo mode."
16888,Great game.  Played it back when it was on xbox.  Still fun to play with friends after so many years.

16900,Its good lol just play it...
16901,"Got this game around 6-7 years ago, it brings back old memories I forgot existed. I love and will always love this game."
16902,"A nice game to play with your mates when you are bored, or just spend some time togheter.
A cool indie graphic and fun is secured"
16903,Castle Crashers is a fun and thrilling game that is one of my all time favourites to play it has engaging gameplay loop that rewards the player for looking behind every nook and cranny and with dozens of character to unlock it is well worth the time. The new 64-bit update shows that  Behemoth cares about its fan base even after all this time.
16904,"No Castle Crashers, NO PARTIES !!! (Of Course Co-op with your friends)"
16905,"a very good game, recommend to play again as za king 69/10"
16906,"fav game of all time
"
16907,"Amazing, fun game to play with friends! Aged wonderfully."
16908,"Excellent Game.
It is a very fun game to play with your friends or alone. The story gets a bit repetitive but, I still recomment this game!"
16909,"This game is brought to us by Newgrounds, and oh man can you tell.  But even if you don't have fond memories of watching Metal Gear Awesome or playing the Impossible Quiz, Castle Crashers is still a fun and cathartic hack n' slash beat-em-up filled to the brim with imaginative character and level design."
16910,"fun game to play with friends and family, and it works perfect on linux."
16911,its a fun game both co-op and solo and is a nice mindless arcade brawler
16912,"!ts fun

16930,classic
16931,yes
16932,"I thought the side scrolling beat 'em up genre was dead or dying, but Castle Crashers has mastered it. I have never had more fun playing a game than I have with this. Even if you beat the game, there are still characters to unlock from beating the game as other characters or from insane mode. Red Knight and Industrialists magic is over powered, so if you want to beat insane mode, those 2 characters are the way to go. I definitely recommend to play with a friend."
16933,This game has hours of fun and is great to play with friends.
16934,"awesome game, been playing co-op with wife."
16935,its good...
16936,Tons of replayability.  I have so many hours on the xbox version and only 14 on pc but thats soon changing. :) highly recommended if you like a good side scroller.
16937,This is great as a drinking game with friends/partners or as a general dicking around because you and you friends wanna spend time together but don't have the energy/money to go out and do shit.
16938,I love it!!!
16939,Takes 10 years to get everything. Worth it doe.
16940,Sword slash fun.

16966,I love castle crashers but it was way to short.
16967,"A peculiar game, really amazing. Brought me from the brink of depression right back to the bridge of happiness!"

16972,Highly recommended! Thank you Behemoth! Much love for the recent update <3
16973,":D
"
16974,Best game I've ever played
16975,"Incredibly time consuming and fun game, some parts are more fun alone yet other parts are better when you do have friends, as it's harder (Volleyball against four npc's when you are alone.) Time consuming, (In a good way) fun, enjoyable and all around a good game. The story can be glossed over however still is intriguing. Great game and would recommend picking up."
16976,"Very good game in terms of scrolling beat em up, more focused on leveling up and managing inventory. Only bad thing I'd say is that nobody plays it online anymore and those that still do are people who've beat the game numerous times and don't want to pair up with new players."
16977,Poopoohahhahahababa i like pooping on my mom sometimes
16978,the best hack and slash game for your money
16979,Absolutely love this game. Very entertaining beat-em-up with plenty of fighting mechanics for you to express yourself with. Highly recommend this game to anyone who likes to play coop with their friends or likes a challenge.
16980,this game is HULARIOS 10/10
16981,"Amazing game, plays well. 

fun with friends. not much replay value"
16982,it's a great 2D game with tons of replayability and there are so many characters to unlock in the game
16983,Fun
16984,net
16985,"Very fun, I though it ould be very repetitive, but despite playing the same levelv multiple times, the different carachters made it entertaining, along ith the various skills that unlock different playstyles"
16986,if you say there's anything bad about this game then you're wrong.
16987,u can infinite combo enemies
16988,Castle Crashers       Liked : Everything      Disliked : Nothing        play solo play with friends whats not to like all around solid game jam packed with fun and laughter.
16989,Its a great pass time and can be a way to meet new people in the random online multiplayer or play with your friends. I have played it since release on every device possible after being introduced to it when i was as a friends house.
16990,"Liked this game 10 years ago, still do! Great work

16996,"I gotta say, me and my cousin had a lot of fun with this game. We bought it on sale for $2.99 and beat it that day. About 6 hours of gameplay and another few hours of just 1v1ing each other. Overall, great, addicting game!"

17000,"Норм игра. Если есть друзья, то можно весело провести время в игре."
17001,It's funny game that I can only describe as a good sort of stupid. It's really enjoyable and the most fun Adventure-like game I've ever played!
17002,"AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!
"
17003,"Probably one of the best 4 player co-op games you can get in the Steam Store! Apart from Left 4 Dead that is. Castle Crashers has a lot to offer to those special groups, composed of four friends, as you'll find your team gaining experience, learning new unique moves in combat and fighting to the death of every chapter, all with a touch of humour. This game reaks of Indie-goodness and it goes for a fact that I love that type of game producing and development; Independently made, tying in nicely together, to make a labour of love.

I love the particular 'crude' and simplistic art style this game has. Coming from the beloved artist, Dan Paladin, his ingenius creativity is best said as beautiful and completely staggering. Every character has a ''comic-component'' to them, including their emotions being presented in that of a slap-stick type of fashion. Interaction with random NPC's and the wacky medieval environments are top-notch and goofy and the rest can be left as fun. What more could be said? 
I wan't more of this game dlc or something i really love it...

''8 out of 10''"
17004,Very good
17005,My opinion this game is really fun i really enjoyed it playing with my friends
17006,great beat 'em up and alot of fun. only problems I have are the wierd hitbox detection and that unlockables carry over between knights. but even that is not enough to bring down the experience. It is a little tough though.
17007,"Very good game, for first time played very funny too. Its best to play with friends. When you think you finnaly beated the game, the real journey will start, but the final boss is little bit too easy"

17060,"Castle Crashers, a 2D hack and slash game, originally released on the Xbox 360 back in 2008, developed and published by The Behemoth. I remember buying this game on my old Xbox 360 and I understand why. I've bought this game on multiple platforms, from PC, to PlayStation 4 and Switch, to whatever else it gets re-released on. It's such a fantastic indie game: Here's why.

In Castle Crashers, your goal is to defeats enemies and save 4 princesses from a dark wizard, who also steals a magical gemstone and uses it to his will. It's up to you as the knight to save the princesses and kill the wizard. Yeah, the story isn't like Five Nights At Freddy's or THE BIT.TRIP, those games have such complex stories, but it's at least enjoyable to progress your way through the game as whatever character you want. Before I jump into any characters, I'll talk about the gameplay.

The gameplay's simple: Kill enemies, collect food and gold, hack and slash and journey through the environment while defeating bosses and saving the princesses. Speaking of enemies and bosses, they're extremely unique. For instance, the Barbarian boss has a wooden spiky shield thing on his back, which sometimes try and crush you with, while the Catfish boss is all about blocking or dodging his attacks while letting the King and his grey knights shoot the Catfish. I honestly love this, as it makes each and every boss not feel samey. One thing this game has is lots and lots of replay-ability. This game is packed to the brim with weapons, pets, and characters. When you beat the game with a certain character, you'll unlock another character, who might have a different starting weapon and/or unique magic. This opens the door to lots of strategy. Maybe you want a character you play as to be more agility focused and more of a ranger, maybe you want one of your characters to be centred around magic, and heck, if you want to, you can go extreme and level up all of your statistics.

The visuals and art are cartoony which opens the doors to gloomy environments, happy environments, and very threatening environments in a way that feel unique each and every time. Each Behemoth game has this artstyle and it never gets old. Infact, it's what makes Behemoth games look and feel like Behemoth games.

Add to all of this, if you beat every level, every boss, and kiss every princess, you unlock Insane Mode, a true test of your skills. From my experience, I haven't even beaten Thieves' Forest on Insane Mode, which must mean it's very difficult, right? Oh it sure is!


With tons of replay-ability, a very challenging campaign, a wide selection of weapons and animals, and lots of strategy, I highly recommend this game, along with The Behemoth's other games, such as BattleBlock Theatre (Theater) and Pit People, which I will also write reviews for."
17061,"This is just all out amazing! Wonderful gameplay, incredibly fun, skills you can get really good at... One of the best times you can jam with 3 mates! And yes.. bring the mates! I especially love the art design and crazy scenarios you get throughout. A big thumbs up!

17113,"this game is really funny and brings back great memories for me, also great game to play with friends"
17114,This game is amazing. Playing alone is 7/10. online 8/10. with friends 90/10. Far better than any of these AAA $60 games. Worth full price 100 percent and No regrets buying it.
17115,This game is fun
17116,Its a great game espesaly for 4 players and the game is funny and intence at the same time i strongly recomend this game if you are looking for a multiplayer game its AMAZING
17117,"Castle Crashers had a special place in my heart...

The gameplay is just as I remembered and the feeling of progress is always fun.
However, the controls on PC are difficult, being defaults that are somewhat outdated, the game is still amazing and is easier with a remote (if you have one).

It would be nice if more people played, so that the matchmaking was more filled... but games do lose players... Friends will make the experience better and you even have the ability to co-op if you want."
17118,":D
"
17119,"Absolutely outstanding remaster that bought back some nice nostalgic vibes from when playing it back on the Xbox 360 with mates.

Recommended to play with some friends, but just as enjoyable on your own.

Has everyone a controller? 
Great, lets go and have a nice evening with your friends ;-D"

17137,"I've played this game before, it was on the PS3, I love this game, not because it's nostalgic to me, but that it is a very enjoyable experience."
17138,"I played it on PS3 & Xbox360 a long time ago and i bought it on steam because this game is a awesome classic. I have to say it runs better on steam then the old consoles. They fix that glitch for the final boss of randomly dying that happened on the old consoles. I recommend it to people that loves retro games or arcadegames this is for you.

I wish Steam made a arcade controller to their store because this game is a arcade beat em up mix with rpg like Scott Pilgrim and river city ransom or river city girls. This game is great for house parties, hanging with friends & family. It's a humorous beat em up game."
17139,Great 4 person multiplayer game for sitting with friends on the couch gaming on controllers on the big screen.  Single player is fun as well.  Can also be played with the kids as the content is kid friendly.
17140,Great game! Cured my illness!
17141,Yes
17142,Very fun co-op but short game
17143,luv u
17144,"This game is a classic enjoyable beat em up arcade styled game. Used to play this on 360 all the time with friends, grinding and maxing all characters."
17145,Awesome game graphics are great PC controls are a little strange but still pretty well integrated. Would definitely recommend if you like humorous games or games with medieval RPG elements to.
17146,very fun and the music slapps
17147,tis gam is soo fun play new11!
17148,Very fun Co-op Game EVER :D

17170,"sooooo good
"
17171,I remember playing the demo of this game on the PS3 with my brother when we were little. It was so fun always having the big black fur ball coming to the screen in the first boss fight and shutting off the light. Years later I remember finely buying the game on the PS3 and playing it so much with my pals. We got to THE LAST STAGE IN THE GAME and we stop  playing it. Then a couple years later I saw it got on PS4 and I got it as soon as it got out. I played it with my pals now on the PS4. And then I got on PC to make videos about it. I really like this game I think its really fun! I guess the down side of the PC one is that you can't use a PS4 contraoller but it is't that bad.
17172,"The greatest game
"
17173,yes.
17174,"Let's be honest, we all have low hours on this game because we all played it immensely on PS3 or 360."

17186,I used to play this on the xbox 360 and it was a shitload of fun to play with friends so i got it on steam and it was so worth it. I still have fun on this like i used to and it's absolutely worth buying. 9/10

My friend got it and we've been playing recently and its brought back so many memories. Personally I'd recommend this to anyone for a nice casual or hardcore time. This was one of the games that got me into gaming in the first place, so id recommed this to anyone i was about 10 when i played this game. Well deserving of the 10/10 from me. :)"
17216,"perfection

17217,"This game brings back memories. It is still a fantastic game, and I have sunk many hours into it. I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a good couch coop game with lots of stabbing!"

17219,"the best
"
17220,"If you´re looking for something that takes you directly to fights, comedy, and is able to play with friends, why are you waiting to bay this game. One of the best multiplier games to enjoy with every single character leveling up all of them."

17223,The corn boss glitched on mine and became the hardest boss in the game 10/10
17224,"amazing
"
17225,"A very obnoxious adventure game that allows for up to 4-player co-op.  It brings a fair amount of challenge to the table while managing to steer clear of being too difficult or grindy.  Regarding gameplay and mechanics, it's alright, although magic is a bit OP last I checked.  I do believe that the soundtrack does a great job of fitting the overall simple aesthetics of the game, while setting the mood really well during near any scene.  

Personally, I give it 4/5.  An excellent, highly replayable title."
17226,jj
17227,"Really great couch co-op game it also has great replayability and if u play this solo it is still a really great game. I may only have like 20 hours on this but i played it on xbox 360 and i have like over 150 hours there. In terms of difficulty i this game nails it pretty good, a casual gamer could easily beat it but when u go into hard mode wich u unlock after u have comleted the game it gets pretty hard and u have to be alot more careful. To summarise it is really worth the prize  and if ur looking for a fun game to play local co-op this is a great one, the humor in this game is mayby a little bit childish but it can still make u laugh at times.

Final score 9/10"

I have played this game on console for years, every since it first came out on the arcade. I loved it from the moment i bought it, and highly suggest it. Its fun alone, and more so fun with friends.

17268,Castle Crashers is my all-time favorite game and I haven't been able to put it down since I was 10 years old. I do hope someone else shares the enjoyment that I myself get out of this classic.
17269,"Perfect for playing with your pals. Really we fucking love this game fighting mechanics are awesome and all but its really hard so see your character at times. Except for that, the game is pretty damn fun."
17270,Most epic of gamer moments in this game. I could play this forever.
17271,good good
17272,"fun game with replayability 
"
17273,"Story it's are nice, gameplay it's are Good too."
17274,there was such a strong sexual aura surrounding the clown boss that it made the game unplayable
17275,"Castle Crashers is a great arcade-like side-scrolling beat em up game!
My first experience of this game was on an X-box playing the demo version!
I may have not completed the game yet, but I know it has plenty of great levels and bosses as well as many bonus charcters to unlock and arenas!
10/10 Would crash a castle again"
17276,"Hello, I am unable to play the game. Once I installed it, it mentioned ""32 bit applications are no longer supported by mac os 10.15"". Please Help me."
17277,Fun when play with friends
17278,Great multiplayer game
17279,"My favourite game. Too bad i have no friends to play with :(

17292,"Very hard game, I bit through the controller wire in a rage, but I love it."
17293,good.
17294,its ok
17295,"One of my favorite games, I remember playing the demo on my PS3 and I'm really happy that I can play the full game now"

17310,Classic must have
17311,me like lot
17312,"Literally my favourite game in the known universe, the amount of replay ability in this game is insane. Castle Crashers has many characters most with their own abilities. (with the exception of a few characters) i could play this game for months and that's not even getting into insane mode, I've only ever managed to get to level 99 once and that was on Xbox.  and even then I've only gotten to full moon on insane mode and i just can't get past it. literally the best game in the world 10/10 bought 4 times will by 4 times again."
17313,This game is hard to play one player but a lot fun when playing with others.
17314,good game but i still want to destroy Israel after playing.

17324,"Very good progression game to play with friends, good for kids. 8/10"
17325,"I remember while playing this game on the 360, a random player joined my lobby, scrolled through every character in the list to show that they were all gold-skulled, and left. I wish I was as cool as that guy."
17326,Such a unique colourful classic that still holds up to this day.
17327,Great game. Amazing deal if you can get it on sale.
17328,Just buy it
17329,Super fun to play
17330,its good
17331,swag
17332,"Have you seriously not played this yet???? 
It's a fun hack and slash which is even better with other players. 
Buy it, have fun."
17333,"Hands down a perfect games with its humor and having amazing battles, when with friends it just gets better"
17334,"castle crashers is a basic beat-em-up game that has a couple of basic attacks and really cool magic, you probably played this game as a kid, enough said, this game was the game you grew up on.

10/10, since it's simple yet it can have an extra layer of depth to it, and the two dlcs go to charity, and, pink knight is the best and that's a fact"
17335,vERY GOOD GAME
17336,"Awesome singleplayer, even better with friends!"
17337,is guud game buy yes do it
17338,Best Local Co-op experience ever!
17339,hello
17340,yes
17341,"Perfect couch co-op game, especially using steam link. I played with my 6 and 11 year old nephews and had a blast clearing stages and messing around"
17342,This game is fun and interactive. The controls are epic and this game is GOOD!
17343,Very funny
17344,"As far as I'm concerned this is a modern day beat 'em up classic.  Just as good—and in some cases, better—than genre mainstays like Streets of Rage, X-Men, The Simpsons, or Turtles in Time.  This game is a total blast, with a fantastic sense of humor, and a surprising amount of depth with some RPG features sprinkled in.  I've beaten and 100%-ed this bad boy three times now, and it never gets old.

10/10: If you STILL haven't played this game after all this time: what're ya doin'?!"
17345,"i really like just about everything about this game. its a little tedious to have to re-play the game for all the characters, but i have fun with that too, so its not too bad"
17346,"This game was my childhood, playing this was like walking down memory lane. I recommend this game to anyone who just enjoys a good time"

17355,it good played it on ps3 and enjoyed it and same story
17356,shgtjgkl;jghfdsghjl
17357,BRUH !

17364,Its fun
17365,"Friend got me this, its pretty spicy"
17366,"I don't have much to say, it's just an overall good time! especially with friends :)"
17367,nice game
17368,"My favorite Game ever, the only problem is the character diversity is small and most of the arena unlocked characters are really lame and have trash magic. but the game is fun and replayable"
17369,"best game even from my childhood from 8 years ago
"
17370,"best game
"
17371,This game is still my favorite game to this day the game never gets old doesnt matter it doesnt matter how many years pass
17372,"This game is nostalgic to me, so I might be biased, but it is such a fun and easy game to play. There is personalization like an rpg, but its also like a scrolling fighting game. It reminds me of something you'd find in an arcade. Very good game, the sprites are adorable, all ages."
17373,"Fun coop beat'em-up with insane and bewildering humor. Starts off casual but the difficulty ramps-up quite a bit, which caused my coop group to give up on playing the story at a certain water level we couldn't pass."
17374,"Good game
"
17375,good
17376,"This game is fun, colorful, funny and so cute! I highly recommend it."
17377,It good
17378,"This game is still fun. 

It's as fun as you remember old side-scrolling hack and slash games ever were."
17379,A fantastic game to play with friends with ENDLESS replayability
17380,great for playing with friends
17381,"good
"
17382,"Great fun game, have some sync issues in multiplayer... but you just restart and they are gone.
Overall great game!"
17383,"its ok
"
17384,it's cool
17385,"Its OK, just the price."
17386,i like it being a beat em up and they perfected it
17387,"<3
"
17388,good game
17389,"69 hours, it must be good then
"
17390,Yeah its pretty fun
17391,corn
17392,"I liked this game back when was a little kid at 12. Now that I am 14, this game is immature and garbage and cringe. 0/10 Raid their discord!!!"
17393,cool
17394,it be classic
17395,"This is a great game of couch-coop and is a riot with friends. You can play this game alone, but I think for most people you should be looking at this game as a multiplayer experience. 
It is notable that the keyboard and mouse support for this game is terrible.

A simply great shashy-stabby game to play with friends."
17396,I finished the game and I think that for now it is one of my favourite games I played.
17397,its good
17398,Great an addicting game!
17399,mmmmmm
17400,My only joy in life
17401,yes
17402,I really like this game. the graphics are really good and each character has it's own unique ability! the funny parts like the barbarian being crushed by the door and the cyclops running into lava make it that much better. there's a lot I like about this game and i do recommend it to other players.
17403,Very good.
17404,pretty epic yo
17405,it good
17406,Haven't played it since it came out. Still a great game.
17407,"The best game to play with my brothers. Playful competition mixed with a healthy dose of intense teamwork, supplemented by a sense of comaraderie. Unbeatable."
17408,"I F-ing love this game, its so well balanced between hard en fun."
17409,Very Addicting
17410,"In my opinion, this game is a timeless classic with tons of replay value.  In the three hours I've played I've already gotten halfway through the game. It's only fifteen dollars and has online gamemodes. As a child I used to have it on a playstation but now I have it on steam, and it is better than I remembered. It's a simple concept and easy to learn. It's so satisfying to swoop baddies off their feet as you juggle them in the air to death. The only problem I had with it was at the very beginning where I had to visit Options > Settings > Keyboard Settings several times to change the jump button from S to Space, and learning the attack controls. But you get the hang of it after a while, and after that it's purely fun! And maybe a little bit of frustration. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a spare fifteen dollars and enjoys beat-em-up style games."
17411,good
17412,/ / //  / // //
17413,"Great Game. Challenging if your playing alone. to the developers i would like it if you would maybe allow a way to change the settings for a controller. im playing on my laptop with an adapter so i can play with a ps4 controller but the buttons are inverted and cant switch. otherwise, great game."
17414,"I mean... It's Castle Crashers? The PC port is pretty amazing, and the game is a classic."
17415,"great art style, stupid humor that's amazing, and of course I hate those stupid thieves XD still good game"
17416,In this game you have a sword and a shield and a power. You go on a Journey to save princesses & beating Bad guys!
17417,"It's a very cool and fun game to playwith friends, reminds me of the old days of atari"
17418,best game ever with friends
17419,just a lot of fun
17420,"10/10 só uma coisa que eu não gostei, é que o jogo (pelo o que eu joguei) a historia dele não tem a ver com o universo de Pit People e o de BattleBlock Teather"
17421,Been playing ever since it came out on the Xbox 360 Store. Really fun and humorous RPG.
17422,Castle Crashers is an awesome multiplayer game to play with your friends! But I wish there were more missions after you beat the game.
17423,its fun
17424,Vrey nice
17425,meep
17426,it's great
17427,It's good
17428,"Replayability: Gr8.
Many characters to unlock, some with new powers. It's very good."

"
17433,GOOD
17434,Fucking hot shit.
17435,I won against my friend 8 times in a row in castle crashers he is so bad lmao
17436,this game is awesome but nobody plays this game anymore and i really want to play online with people so play this game and you will love it in no time
17437,It is a good couch multiplayer game to play!
17438,Good for casual gamers. The game has an amazing story and gameplay.
17439,"Nice game to play with friends, was basically part of my childhood. 7/10 would recommend. Game gets repetitive as there is only one goal."
17440,Really fun game.
17441,"amazing
"
17442,yeet
17443,is gud
17444,how do i get the orange knight
17445,"It Good. I Cave Man, I enjoy."
17446,it was G O O D
17447,This game is extremely fun! I recommend you playing it.
17448,ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh
17449,"This game is great(very hard)
so enjoy!!!
Buy now..."
17450,"If you have at least one other person to play this game with, buy it.
Even if you don't generally like the beat-em-up style, this game is more than enough to satisfy your needs.
The comedy is crude, but not so much that it feels stupid, and the controls are easy to get the hang of.
The main downside, however, is that unless you're playing with friends, you might find the gameplay to be a bit of a grind."
17451,"good
"
17452,"This game is insanely fun! whether you play by yourself or with others, this game will keep you entertained throughout its entirety!"
17453,BEST GAME ON STEME TO ME

17458,WOOOHOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!! absolutely!!!!!
17459,"wacky, challenging at times and love the music"
17460,"I really enjoy these kind of games, especially I love this game because when I was younger, I always wanted to play it. I really enjoy it and recommend it to people that like to play with friends or even by yourself"
17461,"Ever since I bought it, I've had a few hours to have fun every so often. Its best when you have friends, but the single player can be just as enticing."
17462,I love this game it's the best game ever.
17463,Yes
17464,g
17465,.
17466,yea
17467,Its very fun and worth buying !
17468,It's super fun to play with friends
17469,very fun game to play with friends
17470,Hell yea this game is amazing 12/10
17471,"GOOD GAME, I have only played a few hours"
17472,This game is so good it doesn't need me to tell you why to buy it
17473,Great game just like the original castle crashers but would advise you to plug-in a controller for the best experience.
17474,"my personal favorite game. funny jokes, nice graphics, good playstyles"
17475,"This game is super weird, amazing, spectacular, funny, weird, fun, hilarious, and did I mention weird? Seriously, a deer that moves by pooping and doubles as a submarine is one of the best things I have seen. In my life. Period."
17476,very epic
17477,Good game with really nice animation and graphics. Great for anyone who likes combat games and likes a challenge. :)
17478,"play this EPIC game with all your EPIC freinds and kill EPIC enemeys and get EPIC pets and swords
"
17479,"Its a classic, grab three buddies and some snacks and get ready for the long haul"
17480,After all this time the game is still great and fun. Even if you complete the game 100 times you will come back and play more.It has some nice game mods and on pc you have 2 dlc pack. This dlc pack are worth money and i recommended it
17481,yes
17482,"Great for local co-op!
Entertaining, care free, wholesome...
"
17483,"Its older than you think, but its cheap its cheerful and the art style is charming.

Side scrolling beat 'em up with a quirky sense of humour"
17484,slap the boys
17485,bom d+++ eu daria meu toba pros desenvolvedores da The Behemoth só pra eles me presentearem com Pit People porque o Battle Block Theater também é incrível e foram eles quem fizeram
17486,:)
17487,"its a really fun couch bash em up co-op game for 4 people. Age is irrelevant to enjoy this cus i've been playing this game with my daughter and nephew and they really love it. (me included :P).
You start with 4, but you can unlock literally almost every character you see in the game, friendly npc and enemy characters included. game isn't short, has a lot of content, and you have pvp arenas if you're into that sort of stuff"
17488,"An absolute classic, if you haven't played this you have missed out."
17489,Newgrounds classic.
17490,i like to smack people around
17491,"I spent hundreds of hours on this game back in Middle School. It is only right for me to pick it back up again. This is my favorite beat em up of all time right next to the simpson's arcade game. My only plight is the lack of steam workshop, other than that, 10/10."
17492,"An excellent game to play with friends, worth the money and time"
17493,epic
17494,wonderful game its a bit out dated if you are thinking about getting it you should even if you want to wait for a sale its a 15$ game it goes down to 3$ sometimes it is hours of fun per playthrough i am going to restart tonight all classes to level 1 send a chat if you want to play send a chat request and we can play i beleave you have 31 characters in total a few have the same abilities however you can diversify in the early game
17495,"Great easy game, fun for a quick run."
17496,Amazing game. Great for multiplayer with friends or just playing by yourself. I'd highly reccomend a controller but a keyboard can work.
17497,Not bad
17498,I love this game. I have played it on Xbox a long time ago and i got it like 3 years ago but i have not played it in so long. I have played this games so many times and i have loved it every singal time and i have fun every time i play it. So if i had ti rate this game i would give it a 10 out of 10 good game to play with friends.
17499,good family fun
17500,Bom
17501,Awesome Game 10/10
17502,good game
17503,"I love the creativity to this game. It is funny, but quite difficult as you progress. My friend's and I have a lot of fun!"
17504,Very gud
17505,ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I'VE EVER PLAYED (CRASH)
17506,yes good
17507,Best game I reccommend to friends and siblings. 5 stars!!
17508,"I'm Gonna Keep This Simple, 
It's a damn good game."
17509,this game is AWSOME
17510,:)
17511,its so addicting to finish the game and get more avatars from playing the game i love it :D
17512,"Great for playing with friends, good but not great for playing alone overall great game."
17513,The story-line was very entertaining and the game-play was challenging. The game never gets old.
17514,it very goood
17515,perfect
17516,its fun
17517,Best game to randomly revisit from time to time... Would die to roof of cave again
17518,"Its just the best game in the world played through many times
"
17519,i used to play this as a kid on my ps3 so i just like it because of the childhood memories
17520,Really odd game with something new around the corner every time and a yellow head chomping treat that only gamecube players will know.
17521,"This game is an old classic. I remember when a friend of mine showed me this game on the Xbox 360. Was a great game then, and still is a great game now. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes murdering everything!
No, seriously, this game is fun. I stream it occasionally on YouTube and Twitch. I may stream it on the week of the 20th if you wish to see it in action!
Any questions? Leave a comment or DM me :D"
17522,good fun and can keep getting new characters
17523,"yeeyee
"
17524,"Castle Crashers is a very fun game. It has plenty of humor to go along with the great gameplay it offers. It is highly recommended that this game be played in co-op mode. I do not like BattleBlock Theater, one of The Behemoth's other games at all for reference. It should also be mentioned that Castle Crashers does not demand anything spec-wise, which is great for people with low budget computers."
17525,No jueguen el Insane Mode
17526,Its a good game to play with Friends. I reccomend not playing it alone though because it will get a bit boring in my opinion but its a great game for only 12 dollars!
17527,"I've played this game when I was younger. So, when I came back to it, it was just awesome. The game will eventually get dull after a while, but I say it's worth it. Especially for first time players. I strongly recommend it for multiplayer as well. Not to mention you can play it by yourself and still have fun. You get to have pets that help you in battle and items. There is strategy, but in insane mode, the game is just air juggling. So, if you're coming to 100% the game, I suggest you don't even try. It's an awesome game!"
17528,Really fun and there's multiplayer.
17529,Wicked Swell
17530,"Have beaten the game several times, still super fun to play with a group of friends, we need more people playing this game online!"
17531,gud
17532,"The game is really fun, and the bosses, and enemies in general, are really challenging, something that I think makes the game better, The only thing I can say was bad about it, or, IS bad about it, is the lack of checkpoints, for example when I got to one boss and died, i had to replay the entire level to get there again."
17533,Yeet
17534,"Enjoyable game to play with friends, simple, but challenging. PVP however could use some work, Melee users have an absolute advantage.
"

17538,good game I do not like the fact that you can get stunned or trapped at some times in the game
17539,good
17540,Its good
17541,"Played it for so long while I had it on XBOX 360, and while I may have only got to completing the game with only 6 characters on XBOX, I still have probably put many more hours into it than some other pro players. While I may have been bad at the game, I still had a blast spamming. I believe that this game is great for people who like to stick to dumb and simple button presses to kill things, but skill certainly can help a lot after revisiting the game, so you may not bore your friends too much while you drag them into this game with you."
17542,"One of the best games ever

Soundtrack and gameplay are superb!

Worth full price

10/10"
17543,awesome
17544,"Pretty good game, But i gotta get going ya see. I have to get back to playing animal crossing new leaf on my nintendo 3ds."
17545,"If you have a friend you like playing games with, online or offline, pick them up castle crashers and get yourself a copy too. You'll have a lot of fun competing for kills and levelling up your builds, it should take you right back to the arcadey titles you'd play on the original xbox."
17546,"Came out in 2008, still awesome.

17547,its gooooooooooooooooooooooooood
17548,"Got to shout at friends. 12/10











The range weapons the enemies use though. Those fucking range weapons.."
17549,"If you haven't heard of this game by now you should definitely look into it. Castle Crashers is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played. Co-op is where the game really shines however. I love this game so much that I purchased it on three different platforms (Xbox 360 Arcade, Steam, and Xbox One)"
17550,"pretty neato game, havent gotten around finishing it on pc but everytime I play it i get reminded of playing this on the gamecube with my cousins when I was little."

17560,This game is a bit small but REALLY fun if you beat the game andd your bored just play multiplayer i bet youll have some fun fighting eachother
17561,"This is one of the best games to ever fucking exist. I enjoyed this game right up to the end, the animation, combat everything just makes this game perfect. If your thinking about getting it, I would use a controller, but it's damn worth it."
17562,"It's a fun little beat-em-up perfect for co-op play, grab a friend or three and crash some castles, amigos."

Controls great, cute storyline, fun beat em' up action with tons of unlockables, hidden items, and replayability. 

Once the majority of items are unlocked though, enjoyment quickly diminishes.
- I highly discourage solo play. -"
17567,GOOD​ Game
17568,Its fun coop game
17569,IT IS A GREAT GAME
17570,"Remember Golden Axe? Like that but funny as all hell. Lots of characters to unlock and choose from, progression, secrets, addictive gameplay. Sure its fun alone, but this is THE game to play with friends. Challenging yet not controller throwing, it strikes a good balance. Sometimes the cheese rolls in when you just happen to be airborne every time a bomb is thrown, but you learn how to avoid those situations. Game is definitely easier in multiplayer but completely doable in single. It's also surprisingly deep for such a simple premise. I highly recomend this one."
17571,good
17572,My favorite game on steam.
17573,"good game

17574,FUN!!!
17575,playing it for the third time.

But if you love this game, its worth it!"

17578,very fun game. a lot of replay value

17602,"There's really nothing to say about Castle Crashers that's not been said already. It plays great, looks great, sounds great, it's a blast with friends, and it goes on sale for dirt cheap every so often. The name of ""Bi-Polar Bear"" is a little crass nowadays but that's really the only flaw I can think of."
17603,"Um jogo ótimo, porem muito difícil dependendo do lvl, e adoro esses desafios em um jogo. Parabêns aos desenvolvedores."

17616,Good game really liked it but hard mode has a lot of glitches and took me a lot of time to beat it.
17617,The game is really fun.

17624,very good combat and fun to play with friends
17625,"funny knight game
"
17626,Extremely immersive game showing one what it means to be a medieval knight going on a conquest to save the princess. Incredible reality of this game even portrays the fact that back in those days one had to be faster than his peers to pick up gold and weapons just to achieve his noble goal. The soundtrack will have you wishing to go on such a conquest yourself.
17627,this game is big good
17628,yers
17629,"A very fun beat-em-up that withstands the test of time. I strongly recommend this if you're looking for a good co-op game to play with friends, also has a high replayability value."
17630,i got to sit on a deer
17631,This game is awesome! You can have lots of fun playing this with friends or with yourself. There's great replay value because there are many different unique characters to try with different abilities. There are also two other game modes if you get bored of the main mode. I would definitely recommend buying this to anyone who is thinking about it.
17632,"This game is great, had it on ps3 nearly a decade ago and it still holds up. great story and fun gameplay and there's always more to do. 10/10."
17633,This is a simple game but it's super funny. Great to play with friends... if you have any.
17634,"It's pretty good, the Blacksmith DLC character is also a pretty good character"
17635,Very fun and great storyline!
17636,"yes
"
17637,"This game is simply wonderful! The simple combat system is easy to learn, and it is very satisfying to have an enemy stuck in a corner as you beat them mercilessly in mid-air. The upgrades and spells are a welcome addition. The story is also ridiculous and hilarious! This game even has multiplayer. You can play online with friends, but none of my friends own this game. If they did, we would all have a grand ol' time. As you level up you learn more moves, which is one of my biggest problems. In the beginning of the game (towards the end of the first level), you meet up with a giant creature as the boss. some of his attacks can not be stopped with shield, and your character starts with slow move speed, making it hard to evade attacks. The attacks are strong too. Did I mention that some minions spawn as the fight progresses?! This game becomes easier when you level up, but the first few levels can be brutal. I am sorry for ending off on a negative note, but the beginning of this game can be frustrating for younger/newer players. I highly recommend this amazing game, but be prepared for a challenge. Thank you for reading this review! I hope this was very helpful!"
17638,nice

17661,This game is ridiculously amazing. I cannot recommend this game more than I do. It's the right choice for anybody who wants to have hundreds of hours of fun alone or with friends. Make sure you give it a buy.

17677,Awesome little game for tons of fun playtime.
17678,"Perfect for couch co-op and runs perfectly on probably every single device possible. Story is simple enough to understand due to the lack of dialogue. The art style is top of the line and this game is long overdue for a sequel.

17687,Great Story
17688,"I received this game as part of a friends 4-pack purchase, I really love the way it plays and it's a very fun experience. There's a bit of issues with the multiplayer where the lag is atrocious but it's manageable if everyone has good enough systems. Overall, it's a very solid game for friends, I just wish we could bring more people into the fray!"
17689,"Yo, my dad, he's not like the rest
He's kinda like a cute girl, just minus the breasts
He got a solid 4-inch dick, it's hanging and swaying
And when I get home from school, he's always laying there waiting for me to
Take off my shoes, my shirt, and my pants
And then we go to my room and do a nice little dance
I call it ""sex with my dad,"" and don't get it wrong
I only fuck my own dad, and never my mom
Ooh-ooh, I'm in love with my dad
Suckin' my dad's toes and grabbing his sack, yeah
Ooh-ooh, I'm in love with my dad
Lickin' my dads nuts, this shit is so rad, ayy
I've been fuckin' my dad since I was 18
Jugglin' nuts in my mouth and drinkin' hot pee
Garglin' dad juice and twistin' his scrote, yo
This sex with my father is like a romance book that I wrote
Flip to the last page, tell me what you see
It's some beautiful scenery of my dad cumming on me, ayy
You might say it's weird, you might say it's crass
But I disagree because I love fucking my dad, ayy
They call me mad (okay)
They say it's bad (nope)
But I say it's just fatherly love in the best way to be had
(that's right)
So catch me posted on that block, holdin' his hand
Because I love my father, and I love what's in his pants, ayy"

17730,Very fun game with friends
17731,"This is a simple game, one that you only a few times. It is very fun though, and is fantastic with friends. I've noticed that the controls get mixed up with the controller, but you would get used to it fast. There is some sort of story, but it's never really elaborated on, just a classic, ""Save the Princess!"" type thing. Worth the money though."
17732,FUN :)
17733,"its pretty good
"
17734,Awesome cartoon style and graphic effects with a simple yet effective story. This is my favorite beat-em up game.

17755,not bad
17756,"Such a great game from Behemoth, I have been a long time fan and remember playing it on console years back, this is very funny and fun, my only issue is that the controls are a bit wonky but I think it actually recommends a controller so I can't say much about that."
17757,"yes

17761,I wrote a positive review of this product because it is an amazing product.
17762,"This is a fun little action game with a nice singleplayer or co-op experience. My only gripe is that the humor didn't age well, but that's what you get with these old games. Give it a buy when it's on sale."
17763,Very fun game wish a lot of people still play.
17764,this game dosent startup for me i reinstalled it like 3000000 times and it dosent startup verifyed files too dont startup uninstalled my anitivirus dosent startup probobly now geting like 3000000 virus too now
17765,this game is amazing
17766,It good
17767,pretty tasty rate 8 1/2 / 10
17768,Fun with friends
17769,It's good game if you like 2d
17770,"If you consider playing this I would quite strongly recommend getting some friends as it's far more enjoyable. Solo is still fun but is a bit harder and feels like it requires you to grind more in some stages, slowly leveling up just to get past a certain blockade of a level. Not much bad stuff I can really consider mentioning other than the hit detection.
The hit detection can be a bit weird in general, using weapons or getting hit, either way can seem a bit off.
But this game is fun, weird, strange, something something constipation, and memorable. All of this is helped by the pure amazing soundtrack, each place having their own unique music that fits the area quite well. Like come on, Factory, just full of great memories of totally not being one shot or anything like that, just pure enjoyment that place is.
But overall if you and your friends want a new/old game to play that revolves around saving princesses from bosses, clearing several stages of enemies to get to them with flashy magic and nice looking weapons, then try this game out."
17771,Help plz my characters were all reset when i logged on.
17772,Castle Crashers in my opinion is a great game.  It has a unique a story line and has a grind to it.  It has strategy while at the same time being such a simple game anyone could play it.  If you get this game then I strongly recommend to play with friends it just makes the game so much better.  I only wish they would add more to this game like another world you get transported to when you are finished.  I know this game is old but it is still worth to get it and enjoy the grind with the story. plus there a (fart jokes) why wouldn't you get it.
17773,fun experience with friends and alone. incredible replay value.
17774,Behemoth makes good games
17775,Very nice game i recommend
17776,"Actually worthy of a 10/10.

Perfect game, the only flaw I see is that it makes me want more yet there is no more to be had. You may now cry."
17777,Make sure you bring a friend that doesn't just collect coins.
17778,good non ugly :/
17779,It's gud
17780,dope
17781,fun game when your playing with friends
17782,"I was a huge fan of dad n' me when I was a kid in elementary school. It's really hard to believe this is a game over 10 years old, yet I still enjoyed it in every way as an adult. 100/100 recommended."
17783,very cool.
17784,14
17785,"This game is great i remember sitting in my house and watching my dad playing it with friends and asking if i could play it, and he let me and i sat there for 4 hours playing orange knight until my eyes burned. 10/10 hours of fun solo or with friends"
17786,"Nice game that grew from Newgrounds, still gets added content over long periods of time"
17787,i didnt know i owned this game

17789,The only time poop jokes have ever been actually funny.
17790,good game when you have time playing with friends
17791,Good game with cheap price!
17792,"One of the first co-op games I've ever played, and one of my all time favorites. I made plenty of good memories during summer playing this, trying to collect everything in the game if possible and overall just enjoy it. This game has stupid humor and great animations. Give it a try :)"
17793,"Best game ever, beating up enemies but mostly beating up ur friends, i would recommend it 10/10"
17794,Amazing game to play solo or with with a few friends. One of my top favorite games out there.
17795,Pretty good game. Be sure to play with friends.
17796,this game is so fun but is so bad sometimes aliens or other enemy using fucking bow or energy and getting on my head that makes me stop playing it but i love it
17797,"iT’s A cLaSsiC, pLaY iT"
17798,"VERY fun game, even though a little short. What strikes me the most is the attention to detail where there are many cosmetic graphics and animations in the scenery that shows the developers didn't want to repeat themselves, which is refreshing nowadays where the games go on and on reusing every asset time and time again.

Fun alone and with friends on the couch."
17799,"i cryed
"
17800,best game
17801,"Amazing game to play coop, I've had lots of fun playing it.

Recommended if you are looking for an easy to pick up coop game"

17803,Button mashing has never been so satisfying and fun in both xbox and pc
17804,A classic.
17805,bruh it epic
17806,"My favorite side-scrolling beat-em-up ever. Period. That's it that's the review, buy it.
Seriously though, Castle Crashers defined my Xbox 360 days, and for good reason. The controls are smooth, art is pretty, and the gameplay is very, very addictive. Depending on your skill, the campaign can take either a very long time or a decently long time. But if we're talking Insane difficulty, good luck pal. Simple RPG mechanics like leveling up and pouring skill points into different areas (strength, magic, etc.) are nice to have, even if they aren't deep. I won't say the game is flawless, but it comes extremely close. The only real complaint I can think of is the fact that it can sometimes be hard to line up perfectly with enemies, resulting in you swinging at the air like a maniac and taking damage. This is especially bad when there are a ton of enemies on screen. Other than that though, issa mastapeece."
17807,love how crazy this game is love it better with friends :)
17808,"good game, cant get past moon part"
17809,"It's perfectly balanced, as all things should be."
17810,A very fun beat'em up game with a very colourful artstyle. The combat can get a bit annoying with the ranged enemies.
17811,4-player mayhem where you use x and z more then you'll ever do in writing.
17812,"I have just one thing to say about that ending, whatever the developers were smoking i'd like some"
17813,11/10 would beat up my friends to kiss a princess.
17814,"Short but great beat 'em up that is extremely fun with friends.  It can be fun solo, but the experience is with a friend or friends."
17815,Also good
17816,It's a great game to play alone but playing with some of your friends it takes it to a whole new level! HIGHLY RECOMMEND it is totally worth the money!
17817,[h1]60 / 100[/h1]
17818,game i used to play this game now i get the nostalioga hardness
17819,"It remaines me streets of rage and golden axe and i love it. Im so happy to back to the good sega days
Fuck ya i gave this game 9/10"
17820,"One of the best 4 player local PC games from the past 10 years.  Incredibly easy to get into for anyone, has lots of scope for advancement.

Cartoon style graphics means that it hasn't dated at all.

By far the best effort from this little indie games house (Behemoth) in terms of fun/difficulty balance.

Played it an immense amount on X-Box 360, have it on PC for nostalgia's sake.


"
17821,"This game is amazing! I love the cartoon-y action and the variety of bosses. I will admit that replaying this game a lot, even with friends, get a little old after a while. But, other than that I would totally recommend it! Just, if there is a sale coming up, wait for the sale. I also see a lot of complaints that the online multiplayer doesn't work all that great, but I haven't had any problems with it. I love the fighting mechanics, and I love how it is sort of a top-down 2-D game but better (that is the best way I could describe it). This game is one of the best games that I have ever come across in my life. Please, if you are thinking about buying the game, JUST DO IT! And if by some miraculous chance you don't like it, you could always refund it. So yes, I totally recommend this game to anyone who is bored and wants something to just spice things up (or anyone who just wants to have fun)."
17822,"my childhood game, played it again and it was just as fun as it used to be."
17823,Played this with friends and its pretty fun- get a little boring when you play it too long. But overall its fun.
17824,Hey iron man!
17825,play it you will be happy
17826,Worth it for the memories.
17827,this game is fun&relaxing(until u get to the insane mode)!
17828,Fantastic beat-em-up. Even better with Co-Op so bring a friend.
17829,Imma crash ya mum's castle in a feckin minute cUm guzzler
17830,A quick and enjoyable game. It was a treat to play.
17831,Pretty good game so far
17832,god damn this game is good jesus christ i wanna sex The Behemoth so god damn hard
17833,mmm noic
17834,wheres the sound?
17835,ok this game is terrible
17836,"the hell why i dont have this game



anyway"
17837,Friends made me get the game. Tried it for 9 minutes but the loading screen is pretty boring. Wouldnt recommend because it doesnt let you friends install!
17838,very good game =)
17839,good
17840,"Fun, but not too fun."
17841,"A fun side scrolling action adventure game, simple to pick up and burn some hours away. The co-op is also quite good."
17842,"Fun game, can get challenging at times. Awesome to play with friends!"
17843,"It is a rly good game and hella fun
"
17844,"One of my first proper coop games that i ever played.
This game holds a very special place in my heart, and i would heartily recommend it to anyone.
The soundtrack is great, the simple beat-em-up combat is easy to pick up and takes some effort to get down, the wide variety of characters means that there's a lot of potential replay value.
Insane mode gives people who have already completed the game something hard to strive for.

10/10 would experience 2000's newgrounds era poop humour again"
17845,"A funny and fast paced game to crash through with your friends. Love the art style,"
17846,ass
17847,"Being one of my all time favourite games, how could I not recommend this to someone? With a basic plot, simple gameplay and sterotypical villians, you'd think the game would be awful, yet it holds so much beauty and charm as well as grand comedy, even if immature at times, that just makes you want to keep playing on and on and on. Please, for everything good for you, get this game. I dare say it's the best game to buy on steam."
17848,Good Game
17849,"It's good but not as great as I was expecting based of so many positive reviews, it's ok when playing with someone, solo would be mediocre at best, combat is so so, and at times you can be constantly stun locked with is infuriating and opposite to fun unless if you are into suffering humiliation and that sort of things :)"
17850,"My friend got killed by popcorn guy and broke reality, pro gamer"
17851,.
17852,"whenever a friend joins my game , the screen goes crazy!"
17853,This is game is alright i guess.
17854,One of the most fun games I've ever played.
17855,fun game to play with freinds
17856,I liek it
17857,very fun a lot of replay value i never want to quit playing it!
17858,"Pretty good fun, but best played with friends."
17859,"Pretty fun, keeps the feels hidden"
17860,A great buy for anymore with friends solo is also alright. only bad part is the kinda crap keyboard and mouse controls.
17861,"This has to be simply one of the best games in my library. From its fun battle mechanics to its great music and even to its art style that still holds up well to date, despite being over a decade old. Just get this game. No matter what anybody says, just get the game, the 15 dollars is worth it, I can promise you."
17862,"Amazing game with friends, ok game alone."
17863,It's pretty epic
17864,Hella fun beat em up.
17865,"If you didn't but this yet, you're literally retarded.

IT'S 15 BUCKS FFS"
17866,"for some reason my game res is massive and i cant get it correct because the game is too massive, great game tho"
17867,"One of the best couch co-op beat-em-ups out there, especially for its price. The controls are simple and the characters feel good to move with. Replayability with all the weapons and different characters to experiment with makes this a very worthwhile game."
17868,Play with friends!
17869,"It's fun when play along with friends, so hilarious."
17870,"I love this game, it is a staple in my life and gaming career. This is a masterpiece in its own right and a genuinely fun time. It is also a fun game to pop in with some friends and play, it has got a story and pvp arena mode to do. 9/10"
17871,best game i have ever played
17872,"This is a pretty fun game. I play it a lot with my nephews. For those who grew up playing arcade games like TMNT and Captain Commando, they should enjoy Castle Crashers. There is nothing ground breaking, but the graphics are well done, the controls are tight, and the fights are interesting and satisfying. The developers also have their unique art style and sense of humor that adds a special touch to the game. The game isn't too long or too short. It feels about right."
17873,"The game gets repetitive and boring.  It's still kind of fun.  I liked it when I was a kid.  I still play the game who don't play games.  Considering how old the game is I'd say pay $5 for it.  There are better more modern games that fill the niche.  Everyone loves overcooked for instance.  I'm not going to recommend the game because it's overpriced and out competed.  If you aren't illiterate to games you won't enjoy this.  If you are an illiterate then you'll gain some pleasure from it.  Still there's always legos.  Everyone loves legos.  It's not that I don't recommend the game.  I recommend the game at a 70% discount.  That discount is too great to recommend the game in good faith.  

Alright some details.  
It's four player local split screen.  You can use the keyboard alongside controllers with no issues.  It's a hack and slash and slight rpg leveling.  
There are multiple knights to play as.  Each knight has a unique special.
You don't have multiple profiles of the separate knights so you were working on the blue knight.  That's going to be your knight.  You can't share the knight or they're going to mess it up.  You also can't go back to the beginning  with used knights since they're now overpowered.  It harms the local multiplayer relationship of the game.  
The games humor is cheap and crude.  You might like that and that's fine. What you're getting is what you'd imagine internet comic strips to be.  
The bosses are damage sponges.  You'll often become bored with boss fights because you know the routine but you still have to repeat it another 30 times to get to the end."
17874,I have tried to think of like a funny quippy remark about this game but I literally can't think of one.
17875,It is a good game but I find it really hard fighting from all areas because my hands are not that fast at attacking but will become better in time
17876,"إذا راح تلعبها مع اصحابك راح تنبسط على الآخر 
اللعبة بسيطة وممتعة جدا جدا"
17877,"I remember when I was little, perhaps 8 years old, was watching youtube I came across this game and I love the animations and the fightng style. The comedy parts too. Once I got this game I got hooked on it, I even bought the other game, called BattleBlock Theater and it was as entertaining as this game. I would recommend this game for anyone who likes fighting, adventure and action. It is worth the money."
17878,"Extremely fun and funny beat-em-up.  Super tight and responsive controls.  Level up, upgrade stats and frequently get new weapons.

Some enemies/bosses can be real frustrating, but when you figure out the trick it's not too bad.  More fun with friends.

Runs great on Linux via SteamPlay/Proton."
17879,Super fun with friends!
17880,good
17881,Uh oh! Its another fun coop game that releases to amazing people in the world is a great game and watch it be fun for meeeee to be a good person by doing things so they can get to the bottom of the northstar
17882,Awesome game!
17883,Game's good af 99999/10
17884,just fun
17885,Great music. Nice graphics. Fun game to play with friends and families. I recommend this game
17886,i have no friends to play :(
17887,"If You have not played this game BUY IT and the rest
Of the behemoth games They Are Fun"
17888,going helen keller beast mode
17889,"5/5, 10/10, amazing, perfect, worth the cost, buy it if you want it, the price is a bargain, we are lucky it's not $50!"
17890,good game ig
17891,"I'll use this review box to write stuff about my life since nobody plays anything from Behemoth anymore.

I've been dealing with some weird shit for this past month, like for real, having to find out who someone really is by yourself is way tougher than I thought it would be, people sometimes are way too mean and you never even notice shit like that. It's not anything to be sad about, it's just not so easy to let something like that go, it feels so weird to do it but sometimes we have to do stuff for our lives to become better, for us to grow stronger and healthier.

For all you curious people reading, I hope you all know who are your real friends out there, people who will always be there for you, people who say ""count on me for literally anything"" and you can for real count on them for anything and not have to hope that they will some day notice you asked for help minutes before they started ignoring you again. And no, this has no relation to what's happening to me rn, it's not like I would say something like that so vaguely but with so many details at the same time.

And don't you ever worry about not messaging, sometimes all we need is some alone time, so use your free time for yourself, make sure you're happy with what you're doing, don't ask anyone, do what YOU want, being too dependent on what your friends think might lead you to a very uncomfortable path and it might make your life a bit more difficult (who am I to say anything about messaging, I'm literally venting on a review box for a game I last played ages ago).

I hope this helped someone that might be going to something tough, if necessary feel free to add me, talking to some new people is always good when it comes to getting some help. After all, we're all living on the same world, dealing with the same things, let's all help each other, it's a win-win since you get some help and you meet new people (this message works for people who already have me added and don't ever talk to me, I promise I'm friendly lol).

Oh yeah about the game, it's good I guess"
17892,"This is one of the best and funniest co-op experiences i have ever had. There are endless dumb easter eggs, an amazing art style, a ton of replayability, and amazingly fun gameplay. Would absolutely recommend if you have a good friend or friends to play it with."
17893,good game
17894,Dis here b dem best of dem best games o yander there
17895,"Beat the game about a year ago with my brother.
Easy to pick up, easy to beat.
Lots of unlockables
Very little replay value unless you want to collect them all. I have had no desire to play after a couple weeks."
17896,"This game is just action. Grab your weapon and hack and slash.
Really nice art style and definitely holds up after all these years"
17897,This is an enjoyable game for you and all of your friends and I highly recommend it!
17898,"IT'S SO FUN, if you can get some people to play with you you will have tons of fun and get the dlc and it's only $2 and you can get more characters and it makes it more fun."
17899,Pretty epic
17900,"played this game a lot a few years ago, came back to it with my friend and its just as good as i remember it. definitely recommend."
17901,The music makes me think I'm going to have a heart attack
17902,"Play with 2+ People, too fun."
17903,this certainly is a game.
17904,"Castle Crashers was a game that I very much loved when it was out in the Xbox 360 Arcade. When it seen it on sale a few days ago, I couldn't say no to playing it again! Castle Crashers in an extremely goofy cartoonish beat 'em up and although the gameplay is incredibly simple, it can be a real laugh to blitz through each level and level up each of the different characters. One of the highlights of the game is definitely the music and sound effects, alongside the various scenes they can make for a really entertaining time. I'd probably recommend using a controller for this game as it is a console port but if you have to use a keyboard, you can check out my guide that I made for the best layout!"
17905,"My favorite game from the Xbox 360 era, at least my favorite 2D game.
Fun, bright, tight controls, lots of variations in characters. Worth the buy even if you played it on 360 just for the updated 1080p."
17906,An amazing game even if I did purchase it after the hype died down(a couple years after). the gameplay is engaging and the combat machanics are fun it's worth it.
17907,Blank
17908,one of my favortite childhood games and probably one of my favorites of all time
17909,poop funny!!1!!!!
17910,its fun when you have friends
17911,Good fun when co-op with friends.
17912,Played hundreds of hours on my xb360 and got it on steam to have some more fun. It would be great to get an expansion or two for this game. Co-Op favorite.
17913,Had a blast when I played it with the fam. We played anywhere between 2-4 players throughout our run (most of it was 2-player) and it only took 8 hours (surprisingly) to beat the game once.
17914,A bad game for the xbox.
17915,Awesome game and really fun with friends so i really recommend trying it out especially since it's a cheap price!
17916,bruh
17917,"It is very entertaining and pretty easy to play once you get the hang of it. 

 Character/Weapon/Pet Customization 9.5/10. 
 Gameplay 9/10
 Graphics 7.5/10
 Storyline 8/10
 Price for what you are getting 10/10

Overall I would rate this 9/10."
17918,Amazing get it just get it
17919,Grab your friends and enjoy the madness!
17920,"Bizarre/Surreal seal of approval.™ 
-Rated by T.H.C."
17921,"This game brings me so much memories after playing it on xbox 360 5 years ago, living in Colorado. And now i live in Georgia (USA). It brings me back memories by playing it a lot with friends. But if you look in my profile, i will have Texas in instead of Georgia because i was pretending to live in Texas, since it's my favorite state. But omg, MEMORIES OF THIS GAMEEEEEE!!! <3333
and we honestly started playing again with my brother on steam now."
17922,Very Nice!
17923,i love this game it was such a good game i am waiting for them to release it on ps4
17924,so much fun and beauty! must play!
17925,"one of my fave games everr
played it on the 360 and it's amazing to finally play the remastered version"
17926,"This game is amazing
"
17927,ok
17928,Its real good
17929,I highly recommend this game. It is a lot of fun and the animation combined with crude humor makes it a must have! I love this game it is wonderful! xD
17930,"Everything is amazing
"
17931,good game
17932,"Absolute fucking astounding game, with friends its even fucking better, 10/10 always plays again >.<"
17933,Good game fun but challenging. more fun with friends
17934,"really fun 

the only bad thing is that you need friends to play the game because the game is not as fun without friends 


so basically with friends 10/10
without friends 6/10"
17935,"Insanely loud bootup and force changes resolutions of your other windows.
Full screen mode is extremely disruptive 
"
17936,The game to sit on a couch with some friends.  Ice knight is overpowered.
17937,Yes.
17938,"THIS is a great co-op game. A cozy, challenging, side scroller, RPG, sword em' up, pokemon pet grabbin, epic story of protecting your kingdom against the Evil Wizard stealing your Kingdom's Crystal, along with the King's Daughters. YOU. A young brave magic knight venture forth either solo (but you'll always have your pet!) or with up to three other fri-... *ahem* I mean Knights, and kick ass through out polar scapes, dense woods, or on a stagecoach. 

Fight opponents of Legend always with a funny twist.

This game downright kicks ass and if it on sale, especially at a low one, you should find it a mandatory buy. I've played this as a kids with friends on couch co-op and man nostalgia brings me back, man.

8/10 would memberberry again."
17939,BEST GAME 5 Stars sex
17940,epic
17941,What more can you want? It will bring you back to the arcade hack and slash of the early 1990's and 80's. But with adorable new illustrations. Grab a beer and 3 friends and slice your way through all the badies. Well worth the price of $5.99
17942,"this game is such a fun game to play whilst people are round. so much fun. great game.
"
17943,"It is a fuck game that sucks but also is good, but bad"
17944,This game is a great. I haven't played much of the game but what i have played has been amazing
17945,This is a fun game to play with people i loved it
17946,yes
17947,its pretty fun game
17948,It's a good game. too bad no one plays multiplayer on it anymore.
17949,Best game ever.
17950,if you have a friend it would be more funnier
17951,This game a is a must. Period. This is one of the most amazing games you can play with friends. It’s so relaxing. Just get it already.
17952,its fun
17953,You get mad tings innit but like mad game
17954,"These guys do wonders in terms of co-op gameplay, storytelling and visual aspects. Definitely recommend this game just like all of their games. Best played with 2+ players and a controller."
17955,my friend made me buy this
17956,no borderless windowed mode 0/10
17957,why haven't you bought this yet ?
17958,cant play game every time i click play nothing shows up execept  for the little icon it show for about a second then disperes
17959,"Superbly fun game made for 3-4 players. If you try to do a Solo run & try to grind it is awful.
Also Multiplayer Online is like the Mojave Wasteland."
17960,literally my childhood. so many good memories going over to friends houses and playing this.
17961,super fun with friends!
17962,piercing lazer is a really good sounge
17963,how can you not love this game
17964,vERY nICE GAME I like it
17965,Great game.
17966,gud
17967,Ahmed approved
17968,Too short and too simple to be bought at full price. It's worth only at 50% discount.
17969,Very funny and simple hack and slash game which you can enjoy with your friends.
17970,Played this game back in 2008 and still love it dearly. Highly recommend this game to anyone and its fun with friends.
17971,"Castle Crashers is a Beat-Em-Up styled game where you go around a map into various levels ranging from castles, to ice levels, and even a wedding! You get to choose from a variety of characters and weapons. Test out what character and play-style you like and BOOM! Your all set. I enjoy this game because of its fun and -broken- fighting mechanics! Not to mention the various items you get to use bow and arrow lets you shoot, bombs explode, and sandwiches make you buff. There are over 20 characters to choose from, you unlock a new character for beating the game with a previous one or by beating an arena. Overall the game is really fun and I'd recommend you get it if you like Beat-Em-Ups. Get ready for a lot of button mashing."
17972,good
17973,yeah its pretty fun
17974,It's so awesome!!!!
17975,it good
17976,I always did luv knights and the fart jokes
17977,Really fun to just mess around and game with some close friends.
17978,"this game hasint aged a day, its unique artstyle makes this a timeless classic. 10/10 i wish there was a sequel"
17979,great game
17980,a good coop game if you want do laugh
17981,worth
17982,MASTER WORK !
17983,You just smack the same button over and over. It's barely a game. It's mashing a button. You can mash the button with your friends if you want. Mash the button. Mash it.
17984,"I've had this game for years on my Xbox, but when I had a nostalgia overload. Despite my connection to the game, this game is AMAZING. It has a great soundtrack, fun gameplay, and a beautiful and appealing art style. I would definitely recommend this to friends trying to have fun and lots of laughs. 10/10"
17985,"This was a fun game that I had on the PS3, I loved to play it with friends. This is a stellar game."
17986,"A very fun little game worth buying. Although it has to be said that co-op is more or less mandatory, not because of difficulty but because of how much more fun the game gets."
17987,Fun game Highly recommend it to anyone that wants a good laugh.
17988,"Solid gameplay, solid humour, need i say more?"
17989,­
17990,GO CRAZY
17991,"Castle Crashers is a good, simple, sometimes hard, and fun with friends if you dont have friends to play this game with it will be a lot less fun alot of the time (or at least in the beginning) you can just button mash but later in the game you have to learn the bosses and stuff."
17992,"It's an old school button masher. Things missing : other players, health bar of enemies.

If there was an online community it would be fun, but in single player, it's lame. Now I know why it was over 50% off."
17993,A very fun game with friends to play with
17994,"A game thats so reminiscent of childhood, but so much more than that, my favourite button masher"
17995,Castle Crashers 2?
17996,"Great game, fun with friends."
17997,Music in the beginning is fucking fire like so damn good like uGghugGhh WaOaoAOoaoAOAOaOAOaooOAo its good.
17998,One of my favorite games growing up since PS3. Very fun game. Wish they would make a second game.
17999,"Castle Crashers is very fun and entertaining, although I often found myself getting stuck all the time on my first run though the game. I suppose I just had to grind some more.

The game has a very generous amount of characters to play as and the weapons are also really fun!"
18000,i don't like it sorry
18001,A good classic beat em up with a decent sense of humor
18002,hard game
18003,guk
18004,Good game.
18005,A classic game that i remember playing on xbox 360 back when i was younger. Still holds up today and i would absolutely want anyone to try this great game.
18006,"One of the best ever, sitting with friends and playing for hours, just cant say enough good about this game.  Hard enough to make winning actually rewarding, but easy to get into.  Thank you Castle Crashers."
18007,"Installed this to play with some of my young relatives, they loved it. Castle Crashers never gets old."
18008,One of the best games i have played.
18009,Best game of the Century!
18010,i spent 65 hours on this game and im not regreting it
18011,Good Game 10/10
18012,"Good with friends, not funny alone"
18013,"max out speed, she'll be right."
18014,XD this game so Funny
18015,I got bitch slapped by a commoner.
18016,Very addictive game!!!! played with y friends with this and we all enjoyed even if we got disconnected we just recon and head back where we came from (disconnection due to slow internet speed). I even bought the DLC characters which are very very worth once I tried them!!!. it's kinda hard playing it at first also play it in a controller it is really really enjoyable that way. 10/10!
18017,"7,5/10"
18018,"It has been years since I first tried out this game on the Xbox 360, and I still find new ways to have fun with friends whenever I launch this game occasionally, its a must have for anyone."
18019,I died
18020,if u have friends u should own this
18021,"I finished this single player because my friends got bored with it.  Even by yourself its pretty good.  I would recommend maxing potions before the start of each level near the end.  It'll save you some time.  8 hours well spent.,"
18022,"DISCLAIMER: It's my fuckin' childhood so I'm biased.

The comedy of the game feels quite childish at times, but all in all a great game to play with friends.

A good time."
18023,Very fun with friends !
18024,BIG YES
18025,"I mean, come on. It's motherfucking Castle Crashers!"
18026,"Castle Crashers is fun to play with friends. The content is hard at insane mode, too hard at times. Still, great expiernce to play with friends."
18027,8/10
18028,"Pretty fun game, even tho it's 11 years old now the game is really enjoyable.

I love the idea that you have to complete the game with certain characters to get new characters!

I definitely recommend this game!
-Porshii x3"
18029,"I'm giving this game a positive review BUT here's the thing: it's only fun for a little while unless you play with friends, and even then it might only be fun for a little bit longer. Part of the problem is that the XP gain during your Insane Mode playthrough is far too low, or the XP needed to level up to higher levels is far too much. To max level your character, you have to beat the game several times on Insane Mode which is nothing short of a tedious chore. Maxing your character level in games like Borderlands 2 isn't a chore because there's a vast number of places you can go, things you can do, and ways to do it. In Castle Crashers, however, the entire game is scripted through and through and it's apparently common to just use one particular section of one particular stage to grind XP and level up. You just stay in one spot and slash enemies for hours until you're satisfied with your character level. That's not fun. Plus, unlocking new characters just means beating the exact same scripted game again and again and again, and some characters unlock after beating Insane Mode, which means grinding with different characters again and again and again. There are some other issues with combat, like if you're too close to an enemy you'll throw them instead of attacking normally, even without holding a directional (which is supposed to be the trigger to execute a throw attack), which is super annoying because it brings your combat flow to a screeching halt. But really Insane Mode and grinding to max level kills the game once you've beaten it on normal mode. It can still be super hard without requiring a grind, but the grind is what they went for. I have 21 hours in the game but I honestly don't have any desire to play it ever again unless a friend wants to play together. Oh well. Bottom line, I can just barely recommend this game, but try to get it on sale."
18030,A timeless classic
18031,"Fantastic game, had fun from start to finish, takes a little bit to get used to once you do you'll be having a blast.
Good alone and with friends.

 There are some rough moments, but once you get the hang of them you'll have no problem. For example, there's a point where you have to play volleyball to finish the level, it can seem impossible alone, but after a few tries I learned how to do it and won with ease.

Equipment and level up stats provide a nice range of ways to play, I did multiplayer with some friends and had a glorious time.
One friend went traditionally melee and juggled enemies so hard that we struggled to get experience, another friend maxed out his agility before everything else and became so fast that nothing could catch him and he could rapid fire his bow across the entire screen, I went with a magic build where I jumped around obliterating enemies.

There are combos where you have to press buttons in rapid succession, and you have to hold down a button to use magic, so like Behemoth, I too recommend a controller.
Be warned that you will have to button mash.

I give this game a 10/10 and you will too."
18032,"I played this a few days ago. Then I played it again today and singleplayer stopped working.
I chose my character and hit A to ready it and start the game, it readied but also joined a new knight into the game. I pressed B to get it out and my character unreadied."
18033,I have no clue what button I am pressing but i am doing multiple combos (my controller will  broke one day). 10/10
18034,Buy in sale
18035,This game is just geometry dash pc port
18036,"Played this years ago on xbox, is still just as good as I remembered, and is a wonderful game. The concept might not be overwhelmingly special, but the gameplay is certainly for a fun experience, and if you're a person who tries to get 100% completion such as myself, you'll find yourself enjoying the artwork and music in several different ways each time you complete the game. 

The steam version offers a few new pieces of content that the xbox version never had, which certainly encourages you to keep leveling onward. This game is certainly better with friends, so don't be afraid to friend some random people.

My only complaint is that there are a lot of opportunities for achievements, and those seemed to be overlooked. Obviously this wouldn't effect my five star rating. Behemoth may never have done a sequel before but I certainly encourage them to do so with this game."
18037,"too short, too grindy, not very good bosses, combat's too simple and not in a good way, there are a lot of reasons i don't really like this game."

18043,Planks review - 5/10 trash
18044,Castle Crashers has been and will continue to be in my top 50 games. It’s a little sad that there was never a Castle Crashers 2.
18045,"Amazing game. Behemoths games and Dan Paladins graphics style are one of the main reasons that inspired me to head out to the video game industry.  

Check me out on instagram @paroni.does.doodle :D

"
18050,Hours and hours spent with friends and family playing this game. I had to buy it again just for steam to show my support!
18051,Castle Crashers is a classic. And you will not regret playing through it. 9/10 Game in my opinion.
18052,Great game - fun to play
18053,"Very fun game! it's a must to play with your friends. Playing solo it's cool, but this game shines when playing with friends."
18054,My fingers hurt...
18055,"This game is really just meh. I feel like maybe the beat-em-up genre might just not be for me, but that doesn't excuse some glaring issues with the game. Firstly, it's really easy, especially if you play coop like it's intended. There are one or two difficult stages, like full moon or the Necromancer, but there are really easy combos that you can do to stunlock pretty much every enemy just by jumping and spamming light attack. It's not difficult in any way, just boring and tedious since enemies have a disproportionate amount of health. There is also a deficit in content in the game, it'll take you maybe 5-10 hours to beat the entire campaign, and there really isn't much to do after that. You can do the ""Insane Mode"", but due to the random nature of projectiles in the game, it's really just a check to see you're maximum level rather than a test of difficulty. Nothing is changed either, it's the same levels but everything does more damage and has more HP. There are a bunch of unlocks you can get, but there's not really a point. Most of them are useless and the few good ones that you get are given to you automatically whenever you get past a certain point in the game. It's not a horrible game, but it's probably not worth the price. I'd buy it if it goes on sale, but for now, i'd save your money."

18057,"Awesome game, entertaining to hang out alone or with friends. Definitely a must try!"
18058,If you don't have any friends this game punishers you for it by making the game much harder.
18059,"<3
big yes, worth full price."
18060,good game
18061,"This game is better with a controller. Great local multiplayer experience. There are many fun Easter eggs and surprises I have found and laughed at. The story is almost non-existent, but the game-play makes up for that with very good re-play ability. 

Some things in this game I have problems with
~The menu's are simple, but not perfect. It takes too long a time to find what you are looking for when you first play the game.
~There is a simple PVP mode, in which whoever has leveled up more will almost always win.
~There is some down-time when nothing is entertaining. (Desert Levels for the most part).

Other than these smaller problems I would recommend buying it."

18073,"A lot of people find this game very fun with friends.
Though it is enjoyable for a bit, we found the combat turned into a slog of spamming the same combo's while just stocking up on HP items."
18074,8.5/10.
18075,Amazing
18076,"[This review is only based on the single-player part of the game]
This game is really mediocre. 
The combat system is really boring for a hack-and-slash. Not to mention that it is very clunky.
Progression feels unrewarding. You get new abilities as you progress, but the abilities aren't really exciting nor interesting, and most of them are quite useless in almost all situations. Not much incentives to push me through the boring levels unlike other similar games.
The humor is......it feels like it is forced into the game. Maybe it's just me but I find every ""humor"" point stale, repetitive and sometimes cringy.
Story wise, nope. This is not a story game.
Overall a very, very average game. It's definitely not worth the full price, but even when it got discounted, I would still say it is a waste of time.
3/10"
18077,"LOVE IT, an very fun game. Especially I played with my 2 friends and it was easy and fun. 
Pro tipp : every team need to be an wizzard ... waaaay more easyer the game !!!"
18078,"I remember playing this on the Xbox 360 as a child.
Highly recommend it.
Hours of fun and laughs."
18079,yes
18080,"About this game:
The game is about 4 knights, to resceu 4 princesses.
While your trying to rescue them you're traveling through the world to get some loot, xp and git gut.

Pros:
-Great in solo but better with 3 more people
-Cute companions
-More Chars you can level and play with
-Great soundtrack
-Awesome and badass weapons
-Simple styled skill system

Contras:
-Perma grind for gold (its not that bad but its my opinion)
-After one level u'll have to buy health potions in the beginning and late game
-Unbalanced game when u play with randoms: U are level 25  and your random m8 99 its meh
-i dont no

Conclusion:
The game is really good made.
You can have multiple hours and still having fun.
Every Char u can unlock starts with lvl 0 so u can play it multiple times for hours.
This game is really fun with friends.
Buy it when u got 1-3 more friends u can play with.
Buy IT NOW

18097,"I love this game! I hear that this was an old console game and got it on the steam summer sale for $2.99. It is really fun game, you get to play as knights on a huge quest that is both fun and challenging! There are a ton of levels, exiting content. and items. I suggest if you want this game pick it up when it is on sale! I think it deserves an 10/10 for the game overall!"

18122,"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign her"

18132,was and still is a great game
18133,this game is really fun
18134,This game is funny cool fun
18135,"it great 
"
18136,"it's like one of those well made flash games, but better."
18137,"This has become my favorite for beat-em-up style games.  And now my daughters love it as well. 

Quality family time.  10/10"
18138,Good Gaime
18139,"gioco fantastico, già finito più volte sia nella modalità normale che quella insane, molto più divertente e semplice se con amici"
18140,Ờ Cmt cho có
18141,"Boring, flash game but in steam."
18142,"Very fun game!!! made me have a nostalgic feeling when I this game throughout
"
18143,"Although some Charakters abilities are very alike and get a bit tiresome if you try to play all 40 or so Charakter, I had great fun playing it. Rushing through all stages over and over again never gets old, partly due to the awesome soundtrack."
18144,hey guys if you go to thiefa forest with cardanal behind the bush with the owl cardanal will do behind it and grab the boomerang. you throw it to sstun enemys and if you hold it the farther it goes the maximum is when it starts to get white lines around it
18145,game good play when drunk = fun
18146,"A really fun game if you have friends that want to play with you or else it'll get a bit tedious just grinding levels but with friends it's a different story

Buy it when it's on sale like seriously"
18147,dislike
18148,"Originally played Castle Crashers on the Xbox 360, and knew I had to grab it for $3 during the summer sale. Just a great beat-em-up game to play casually, ESPECIALLY with friends. The art style and humor are as good as I remember, and there are a solid number of different enemies and level designs that keep the game interesting. Unlocking new characters and collecting all weapons and animal orbs allows for decent replayability. Overall highly recommend to play with a group of friends - it will be a good time. However, I would advise waiting for the game to be on sale to get the best bang for your buck."
18149,"I don't understand why I bought this game second boss stunlocks me every time, I can't do anything."
18150,too many dead troll children that die and its scary :(((((((((
18151,first game i bought
18152,this game is so fun and i am glad i have it and play it with friend
18153,"I received this game and at first I didn't care for it that much, until I played with a few friends it was awesome to play with all the different characters.

The game has a lot of customization which I support for a game like this one, and if you like some challenge and battle you should buy this game.

9/10"
18154,good
18155,"Its a supper cool game with a lot of levels 

I like th devs and the intros for the games ! xD"
18156,"i unlocked a drunken Naruto Pirate...

what else could you ask for in a game"
18157,"Seems like a good, well oiled game for co-op, but solo it just didn't click for me. Requires too much clickity-click for my sore hands."
18158,This game made my childhood on the xbox 360 where i did everything then i got it on my ps4 and got everything again and ive had it on pc for a while played it again not maxed it yet tho ive been waiting for my friends to get it aswell so i can play with them one last time. but now when it is coming for the ps4 aswell i guess we are gonna play it 2 more times UwU <3
18159,i loved this game a long time ago
18160,"good game, not worth $15

buy it on sale"
18161,I like the game.  The DLC is the best thou.
18162,Probably one of my all time favorite games. Even if you've beaten the game several times with different characters there are enough levels with unique aspects and characters with their own abilities so that it doesn't get repetitive.
18163,"buy the 4 pack and play with friends, literally the best indie game of all time"
18164,Nostalgic and very fun to play with split screen and with friends on the couch
18165,I want to rape green princess.
18166,"i hate this game it sucks, 5 stars"
18167,one of the best games ever made
18168,The game is so fun.
18169,The barbarian boss obviously has golden guts.
18170,"great couch co-op game, highly would recommend to play with some friends"
18171,gud game
18172,"very good
"
18173,That's just fun I still play it today
18174,A really fun game to play especially with your friends. The game also features some nice 2D artwork.
18175,"Honestly, one of the most fun games I have ever played. Best if played with friends for multiple playthroughs. Definitely my best Steam purchase. Would recommend to anyone who wants to have some good times with their friends."
18176,I think this game is better on xbox 360 cause of the fun i used to have but if you just wanna play with some friends pc is the way to go.
18177,"Only with friends
it'll be boring to play it alone"
18178,NOSTALGIA
18179,"A very funny game, definitely worth getting"
18180,The story is the best and co-op❤️❤️
18181,"This game is very uncomfortable to play with, it does get repetitive for a while but, the game is still ""ok"". ONLY GET THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE 3+ TO PLAY WITH.
Also, the online was broken for me (idk if its just me but im not able to join online matches)"
18182,This is a really fun game but the ending level is very hard
18183,One of the best games i played.
18184,"Very fun to play with friends, or just online in general. This game doesn't get boring much, as when you beat the game, there's another character to move onto and play, and beat the game with- which also leads to a new character. Endless amounts of fun, and overall an amazing game. Would recommend strongly. If you're looking for a game to play with your friends that's not too pricey and complex, this is the game you should buy."
18185,bruh
18186,very nice
18187,"it good game. it has epiccness 
when you play with friends."
18188,Perfect sequel to condom crunchers!!! Great Game
18189,is SO GOOD
18190,I didn't get it for free
18191,"A classic worth going back to every once in awhile, good game with friends as well :)"
18192,"I like how many different classes there are and how you can upgrade your stats, my favourite thing is to do long combos in the air."
18193,"I bought a four pack for me and my friends, but it ran badly. We tried to use the fixes, but it still ran badly. #wouldnotrecommend"
18194,"I was playing the with my friend and the game was running like i was using potato, so turned the settings down and so did my friend but it still ran like ass crap."
18195,The go to co-op beat'em up. The origin of Indie games <3
18196,"Gotta fuck'em all. 

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
18197,yea its good i guess
18198,Fun sidescrolling beat 'em up
18199,"It an OK single player side scroller. But sitting down with some friends and going around Finding eastereggs, clearing bosses and finding animal orbs or other secrets is where this game shines."
18200,worth
18201,Really excellent~
18202,"I feel 12 again playing this. Couldn't be more happier with the repurchase. Even glad to say a few of the day ones are still around to run through this with me again. 

Great arcade side scroller to play with friends or strangers online. Very easy to pick up, hard to put down once you get the hang of it. Would for sure say this game is worth the pick up if you enjoy replay value."
18203,Treasure is the best minigame in this game xd
18204,Y e s
18205,"This game is alot of fun in my oppinion, especially with friends. The chaos is insane and all you have to do to beat a level is just jump and spam light and heavy attack, if done correctly youll start floating and i find that rather amazing. Its totally worth the money."
18206,"Silly. Funny. Juggly.

It's downright a-gore-able."
18207,this is an amazing game
18208,bASED
18209,Quite possibly the best game ever made
18210,Really fun game
18211,nice
18212,play if you want to become the definition of toxic masculinity
18213,play if you want to cry for an eternity :'(
18214,Sadly fun
18215,it good
18216,Great game
18217," It's  a pretty basic game, rather arcade game like with it's side scrolling and locked from next screen till you defeat the current enemies.  Being able to play with others online is nice. I think it allows local multiplayer but I am not sure. Don't buy if not on sale"
18218,"good game'
"
18219,cool game
18220,7
18221,luv it
18222,"Reminds me of the flash games back in the glory days of Newgrounds. A ton of fun with friends, definitely get this on sale. And don't let any of your friends have the rest of the gold."

18229,Cool Game
18230,still fun
18231,"What a Classic, Castle Crashers is such a fun game when you got friends to play it with, granted it can get kindof boring alone. The Music is just great. It is such a fun game to play."
18232,"Smack your friends in the arena!  Slash your enemies on the map!  Smack your friends again in the arena!  Marvel at how underpowered Hatty is!  Gasp in surprise when you find out Green Knight ISN'T the most overpowered character!  Laugh at 2012 newgrounds humor!!!  Question why Hank Wimbledon is not in this game!!!  Smack your friends in the arena!  Again!!!  And read this entire thing in the Battleblock theater narrator's voice!!!  Does this sound fun to you?  It sure sounds fun to me!  Join the fun right now!!!  You don't want to miss out on it, do you??  Because it would be...totally bad and stuff if you missed out on the fun.  Because then how would you be able to enjoy the game if nobody else is playing it...just join the fun already, friend!  Before it's too late!!"
18233,11/10 would play again until every character is unlocked
18234,Great couch based co-op madness!
18235,"A really fun game, is better with all your friends.
I was playng alone, but when i started playing with friends, i got a better experience :)"
18236,Started character. Joined online. Got carried to end of game. 10/10 would lounge through story again.
18237,This game is Awesome I love it!!!! 90 stars
18238,its very... Dank...
18239,"waow this is pretty dank, my feelings are moist"
18240,I've played with my bf and my bro and it's such a fun game to play with multiple people and the story and art is so amazing. Definitely a good game to play on a couch with those you like enough to battle with and even against eachother.
18241,Never gets old
18242,Easy game to replay and replay.
18243,Good game
18244,"Very meh

18260,Being able to play this game at better frames on a newer system brings back old memories and is totally worth it!
18261,"[b]YES[/b]

You can play this game alone or with friends."
18262,"Castle Crashers is a simple, fun throwback to the 2D arcade beat-'em-ups of the late 80's to early 90's. It has the cartoony look and silly sense of humor of other Behemoth games. There are dozens of weapons to unlock, stats to level, and combos to learn."
18263,very fun game
18264,Fun Game to kill some time
18265,Best game ever made
18266,yes
18267,Arcade style hack n' slash game that you will enjoy playing with your friends! Totally recommend it!
18268,"Thought I would Finally try this out since I have played Battleblock Theater.
 I am enjoying the game so far and its pretty easy as far as moves and such. 
Only thing I am not fond of is every fighter I have has to go through the story so I am stuck with playing 1 fighter but I will go back to play the others at some point :) 
Worth the entertainment and the jokes in the game"
18269,Pure arcade fun.
18270,I already had this for the xbox 360 but I much prefer to play on the computer
18271,I diagnose you with retard 8/10
18272,"use to play this game all the time on xbox. Playing with the old squad, nostalgic is rushing over me like strong hot winds in a desert, brings watery eyes as i realize i have to start at level 1 and do not have a giraffe to level up faster. 10/10 would start again"
18273,"Great game, tons of silly fun"
18274,guud
18275,"Cute, Funny story & gameplay, Simple but Challenging enough, Amazing games to play with your Girlfriend / Wife!

Had a ton of fun playing this!
A definite recommendation!"
18276,"Castle Crashers is the game that has brought me into the beat 'em up genre. Easily one of the best games period. Great music, great characters, great replayability, and a great time. Two big thumbs up from me."
18277,gr8 banans
18278,sadiquisimo hermano
18279,"Played a ton of this in 2014, and recently came back to it. The combat is still simple yet fun, and the Necromancer's theme is still an absolute banger."
18280,Great game to play with friends sober or not
18281,This is an EPIC game.
18282,I like castles
18283,gud game
18284,"Most amazing bunch of bullshittery ever. 
420/360 would defo play again"
18285,I loved the way the game played just like back on the playstation. It was something I grew up with and am now having fun with friends on my razer machine. It's a no brainer for some four player couch fun.
18286,Super fun hack and slash game that I can easily recommend to my friends and anyone that wants to buy it.
18287,I like tacos c:
18288,Excellent Game. Funny characters and Maps. Little bit short Game.
18289,Great game!!
18290,THE CASTLES MUST CRASH!
18291,"A wonderful little game from my childhood.
Tight controls. Pleasant 2D graphics.
Gameplay is fun and is diverse enough.
Sound design makes every swing satisfying

100 arrows from thief arena / 10 pooping-jet deers"
18292,"This game is funny, fun to play with friends and has a lot of replay value. What more can I say?"
18293,Amazing! Really gives me the Xbox-arcade vibes back! 10/10
18294,i really like that game
18295,"Very good game, nice replay value and will always give you a good time with your friends"
18296,epic
18297,"A+++++ I love this game, it is really fun to play with friends and the story is awesome!"
18298,This game is hilarious and was a great time to play through. Definitely recommend as a great couch coop game
18299,very moist
18300,Green knight sucks
18301,A brutal fun game
18302,Great combat and levels.
18303,very funny co-op game!!!!
18304,p good helicopter simulator.
18305,"If you gonna play this game with friend(s), get yourself a laughter-cancelling headphone, because that would be the only sound you hear, most of the time."
18306,"Some of this will be nostalgia based, though I do have small nuances of things that annoyed me while playing.

I played this game back on the Xbox 360 when I was a kid, looking at the game now I realize I was probably terrible at it back then, but I still enjoyed it nonetheless. This game hasn't had any performance issues on my trash pc, other than some lag when playing with a friend which made things super-slowmo for some reason.
The game spikes in difficulty a lot, ranging from ""these are enemies?"" to ""i couldn't even get one hit in without dying"", such as constant stunlocking by a barrage of arrows that you couldn't block or move from, because... you're being knocked down as soon as you get up, or yeah mainly the issues of gameplay are based upon the fact that you get knocked over really easily.

Arena is a joke. This game was not made for PvP.

Despite my complaining, I love this game, it's probably much more fun with 4 people, but I could only play with one other person. The animal orb system is something I forgot about but still found useful, there's tons of secrets, mainly through use of sandwiches and bombs, and the artstyle is still funny and welldone even given the age."
18307,"Fun for playing with friends...assuming you have those. If not, then playing solo will also be fun cuz of the cartoonish graphics and stuffs...."
18308,It seems so simplistic yet it is one of the most fun games i have ever played
18309,FUN. GOOD FOR SPENDING TIME WITH FRIENDS
18310,gud
18311,A classic for the ages. I grew up on this game and 10 or so years later I still remember most levels by heart. it does run better on PC than it ever did on the 360 >:P but in all regards its a fun silly game that will make a grown man weep tears of joy with fart jokes. This game will always have a place in my heart.
18312,Good game. Play with a friend for a balanced competitive experience.
18313,amazing
18314,"-If character in Castle Crashers have until skill and the game have more mode, this game will be perfect.
-By the way, Castle Crashers have more waves game and more character in DLC, I will buy it."
18315,"amazing game, always fun to come back to, never regret buying it"
18316,Just a good sit back and relax game to enjoy with friends.
18317,A very fun game to play with friends :)
18318,"I play (carry) this game with my girlfriend.
10/10 would carry again."
18319,"Who doesn't like saving bitches when you play as a crusader who fights through hell and back?

Through blade and arcane powers, both work in tandem to help you fight your way to victory.

Cue up some Sabaton and/or Powerwolf and lets the crusading begin, brothers and sisters!

We've got heretics to kill."
18320,"Love it, now I need to buy a controller to prevent carpal tunnel. Worth it"
18321,it is the best game in my life
18322,Really great game to play with your friends.
18323,Adequately solid
18324,Crash dat ash.
18325,i have always enjoyed this game. this is actually my second time purchasing it. this game is amazing if you have 3 other players. each new area has a series of levels eventually leading to a boss battle BUT after you beat the boss you have to defeat your allies right after to claim the prize as your own.
18326,"I bought it for the nostalgia, and I kept playing because there is a good reason why I remember it fondly. 8/10"
18327,good for a family of 4 ;)
18328,"I remember playing this as a kid on the 360, it's still just as good as it was then, but even better now on PC. This game is so good, and great with kids. Plus super easy 4 controller multiplayer, it's one of the best games you can find for couch co-op on the PC STILL. You can't go wrong."
18329,c*ck and balls?
18330,"Heck, awesome game. Play it a lot."
18331,...Amazing
18332,cool
18333,"great game to play with others, get this on sale and it will be great"
18334,I want to die.
18335,"Hella fun, blast from the past!"
18336,Still fun!
18337,Fantastic game. Hours of Fun on the XBOX and now here as well. If you like side scrolling beatem ups this one is for you
18338,Epic
18339,Great Game!
18340,"If you're looking for a game to beat the living fudge out of everyone and do it with your friends you have come to the right place! This game is so funny and it has many different ways to play the game! if you want to be a alien who dies in a single touch but kill instantly, be a mage! want to take and do intense amounts of damage, be a tank! So many different ways to play the game and I give you my word ""Boredom"" Is not a word in this games vocabulary. Peace out and have fun!"
18341,fun
18342,a fun throw back
18343,"A pretty good hack and slash with a lot of playable characters to replay the game with. The only downsides are that a few characters have the same magic as each other and the game is short. Overall, highly recommended."
18344,"THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER, that's all I have to say <3333333333333333333333333333333333333"
18345,its a fun game to play at lan partys and with freinds

18347,"It's a classic known to console and PC
whats not to love about this"
18348,is fun
18349,fun and enjoyable with friends
18350,"Fun with local co-op, and perfect to play with kids."
18351,"Played this game years ago on xbox and loved it, coming back to it now and it's just as good as I remember. Fun alone seeing all the different magics or with friends."
18352,is good
18353,Excellent Game!
18354,"Pretty fun, quick little game to play with friends. Fast to get into and takes a while to get through."
18355,"good game, 10/10"
18356,"Wonderful! Combines my three favorite things! Castles, crashing, and doody!"
18357,"Played this on my PS3, and XBOX 360 now replaying it on PC. Great game, a good grind and loads of fun with many people."
18358,"Very good and funny game, but sometimes I get super mad when like 30 enemies surround me, and start gang-banging me :/"
18359,"This game is definitely worth buying, because a lot of fun can be earned while playing this game!"
18360,yo
18361,"What a fantastic game. Everything is just great, the controls are good, the gameplay is great, the humour is on point. Everything these developers make are awesome."
18362,its ok
18363,Great game.
18364,"Fun to play with friends, but do not attempt to complete insane mode without a group of max stat characters"
18365,"Wasn't disappointed, reminds me of my xbox360 days all luh"
18366,As great as I remembered it on console.
18367,haha this game is a big funny lots of poopoo caca fart jokes haha so funny flashgame newgrounds fart peepee joke haha wow its so comedy so much funny it make me so laugh haha very funny jokes in this game so funny
18368,good !
18369,good game
18370,Fun with friends
18371,"This game is honestly great. I've had the game on ps3, now on steam and want to get it on switch because it is that good. The game never gets old and to be able to play online with friends, or even random people, is great. There is so much fun to have in Castle Crashers and I highly recommend it."
18372,yes
18373,"So Far is a lot of fun to play, but it randomly keeps freezing which may be due to it being multiplayer. Also it does not go ultra wide aspect ratio but does go to the resolution. Would be 10/10 based on art style and design, but 9/10 because it does not even have stretched fullscreen for ultra wide or any options for it."
18374,"Incredibly fun to play, either solo or with friends!! Tons of characters to unlock, and a decent challenge to get through especially by yourself."
18375,wait why is th e geometry dash song in the game wtf :OOO
18376,this bitch fun af 10/10
18377,"amazing game, just wish it was easier to level up"
18378,absolutely wonderful game
18379,Awesome
18380,Pretty fun 2D arcade game. More fun with friends
18381,"TL;DR
If this is gonna be the type of game that you are only gonna play solo its good.

Trust me since I have a thousand hours on this game.


-Hundreds of glitches
-Multiplayer has tremendous lag issues, I'm talking over a second of input delay on average in games
-1v1's are fun



If this game is gonna be the type of game that you play once with your friends then never play again, sure its good.
If you are gonna try to make more progress then no its bad.

Multiplayer - is a complete disaster with its lag issues.
If one person lags / has a bad computer everyone lags.

Arena - This is something I play a lot, its fun however lag completely ruins it.

18384,buy this game because it good and play it with friend
18385,"At first, I thought ""Castle Crashers"" would be OK.  But, as I progressed through it, more and more things started bothering me.  Finally (11 hours in), I threw in the towel at ""Sand Castle Roof"" (level 26 (of 36), at the end of Chapter 8 (of 12)):  the boss fight is a Volleyball Game.  Here's someone else's video:

https://youtu.be/bdAwkfrlUgY

and a wiki explanation:

https://castlecrashers.fandom.com/wiki/Sand_Castle_Roof

But, let me back up a bit.  My first irritation with the game was that even though the game CAN be played with keyboard/mouse, it really needs a controller.  So, I bought one and used it.  Second, as you go along, you find that even though you CAN play it Single Player, it really needs a party.  And, it looks like it really needs to be a full party of four.  Exhibit 1 is that Volleyball Game.  The opposing team has 4 characters, while I'm all by my lonesome.  So, I'm far more likely to miss that ball than they are.  Plus, that Volleyball Game is the boss fight, so if you don't beat it, 1) you're stuck (since it's on the critical path and there's nowhere else to go), and 2) you lose all progress towards it from the previous map if you quit.  I thought I could work through the difficulty of the maps in Single Player just by grinding.  But, this Volleyball Game just stopped me cold and pushed me over the edge.  So, I'm Not Recommending the game at any price."
18386,Very fun side-scrolling-beat-em-up. My friends and I play it together; it really makes for a good time.
18387,A gem from a past that I still play to this day.
18388,Grew up playing this game as a kid. this def is a great and fun game with friends!
18389,"If you want a game to screw around with friends for a couple of hours, this is it. Just screw around, cheat, do anything aslong as youre having fun! :D"
18390,just awesome
18391,Surprised me...
18392,"Castle Crashers is multiplayer sidescrolling beat-em-up. You can level up abilities and equip different pets and weapons in order to become more powerful and complete many different levels.

Breakdown:

Okay things:

-Solid multiplayer fun. It's decent fun to just load it up with your friends and play through a few levels. Not too much to say on this.

-Music is alright and atmospheric. It's usually fairly simple, but it sets a mood for whatever level you're in. It doesn't distract from the gameplay while still being significant enough to add to the experience. It's a hard thing to balance, and this game does a solid job on it. However, if you start paying too much attention to the music, you might realize it's fairly repetitive, and you might get annoyed, so I can't praise it too highly.

Slightly Bad things:

-Lots of items, characters, and pets are locked behind certain out of game things, mostly owning other games from this developer. It's not a huge deal, but it's slightly irksome that not all items are unlockable through the base game.

-Tries too hard to be funny. For example, there's a level where you traverse through the woods and encounter many animals who poop all over the place for no reason. It's just potty humor. It's not a huge deal, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't detract from my experience at all.

-In multiplayer games, one player can fall a bit behind and lose relevance. This game can just have a bit of a snowball effect. If one player does poorly in the first couple of levels, the other players will level up faster and be more powerful. This makes it so those players get most of the kills and experience in future levels, causing the player who did poorly early on to fall further and further behind. That said, the effect isn't that huge, and this game is too casual to care about it all that much, and it won't even be a problem in certain groups.

-Odd visual issues with the resolution. The game looked a bit off when I first opened it, so I set it to my computer's resolution, but that caused it to get much worse. I double checked my resolution, and it was exactly what I put in. I basically had to try other resolutions at random until one of them fit.

-Many interesting combos that just don't feel rewarding. The game has a lot of interesting combos and magic abilities, and it can be fun to try to use them creatively. But, after doing that, I just tried button mashing with only a little direction, and it seems to work just as well. So why does this game bother putting it all these mechanics if they don't even matter? As I mention later, this game is quite chaotic. So the problem here is that the game seems to have more mechanics than it needs to. The chaos just makes all these mechanics not feel meaningful in the slightest.

-Poorly designed UI. Just one example of this is when you want to get items, and it gives you a little summary of the stats of that item. However, this overview is usually partially covered up by the player portraits (gets worse the more players you have), and it requires some annoying finagling around to actually read the summary. (I previously had this under ""bad things"", but a friend informed me that you can hide the player portraits, making this more workable. It can still be annoying when you're picking up items in the middle of a level and want to keep track of all the players).

Bad things:

-Extremely chaotic and cluttered screen. There just tend to be so many things on the screen, it can be very hard to tell what's going on. This issue is exacerbated during boss fights. The bosses often take up so much of the screen. In one fight, I was fighting the minions while my friends were taking on the bigger boss, and then the boss stepped in front of me, and I could no longer see the fight I was having. Another example is a boss in which there is a ship who helps you out. Although it takes up about 1/3 of the screen, which isn't exactly helpful...especially because the boss itself also takes up about 1/3 the screen, leaving you very little to work with.

-Hitboxes very hard to deal with. The game is 3D but with 2D graphics, and the depth can be very hard to judge. I'll try to hit an enemy, but oops! I was standing 2 inches behind it, so I missed. This works the other way as well. Several bosses have attacks that take up almost the entire screen, so you have to rely on moving forwards and backwards to dodge it, but it can be really hard to judge that.

-Misc bad game design decisions. Several examples: A mini-boss who has a very fast long-range attack that does a lot of damage...and the attack isn't telegraphed at all. Also, a boss who revolves around a certain mechanic to beat that you might not even notice exists, unless you're paying attention to the background. And, as mentioned, the game is chaotic enough as it is, so you're probably paying attention to the boss and its attacks, rather than random background elements that don't seem to be impacting the fight.

-Poorly optimized. This game came out in 2012, and I played it on a new-ish computer that is mid-range in terms of power. And yet, I have consistent frame lag throughout the game, despite not having any other programs running that take up much CPU power. My friends also ran into this issue.  I don't just mean the game wasn't running as smoothly as it could've been. I mean the game occasionally slowed to a crawl, running at 1-3 FPS. This game has fairly simple graphics, and it's somewhat old, so I see no reason why it should run into slowdowns on my computer.

OVERALL RATING: 3.5/10 - Would not recommend buying.

The only reason I would ever recommend this game is if you are a huge fan of the genre, and are constantly looking for new games to pick up, and you enjoy them enough that even a mediocre one will satisfy you. Even then, this game isn't great in singleplayer, so I still wouldn't recommend unless you have several friends with similar taste as well.

For the rest of you, I can't recommend this game. The overall quality is quite low, and there are numerous major design flaws."
18393,"Fun game to play with friends. I wouldn't recommend playing it alone. 

Pros:
 - Easy 4 player online co-op
 - Tons of weapons and pets
 - Distinct characters with different abilities
 - Many levels and bosses
 - Good sound effects

Cons: 
 - Hitbox detection feels a bit weird because of the 2D visuals of this game while having 3 dimensions.
 - Some bosses are poorly designed or balanced

18429,Really fun and easy to play game
18430,"If you enjoy uncanny swordmanship, bad puns, and saving princesses, Castle Crashers is for you. This 4 person co-op game is the best party game to have. Castle Crashers has been one of the games I have played my entire life with my brothers for over 10 years. There is never a time where I am not laughing at the silly animations or head slicing of enemies. What this game has that others don't is that it brings you together with your teammates, and forms a relationship where you work together while trying to be above each other. This game will give you ultimate bragging rights for life. This game is for those who like playing with others, fighting and slashing, and want to have a good time playing a classic."
18431,cool
18432,"good but i got it as a gift
"
18433,Very good game with friends.  A classic.
18434,One of the best games made.Pefect at everything.
18435,LIT AF
18436,This game is nice to play with your friends or family
18437,"I played this game back in the Xbox 360 days and man it was a blast - and it still is on Steam. One of my favourite games of all time I'd say. It's a very nice hack'n'slash-beat 'em up adventure with a nice art style and the music is very neat too (Necromancer theme is great!). Super fun with friends too; I played in a party of 4 locally back in the Xbox 360 days and it was a blast. We beat the game in one night. There's an RPG style level progression where you can put skill points into specific skills to make your character stronger, and you can also collect a wide variety of weapons and pets to assist you on your adventure. I would say there is some nice replayability too if you're into repeating one story many times. You can unlock new characters when you beat the game with other certain characters and there is also an ""insane"" mode that you can activate on a character that has beaten the game once. This insane mode simply makes enemies tougher and this can give reason to beat the game twice with one character. There are many other features too but I'm considering this a simple casual review.

If you like cheesy humour with hack'n'slash, beat 'em up, RPG, and an awesome art style you'll love this game. Great to play with friends. Now go save those 4 princesses! ;)"
18438,"If you're searching for something nostalgic, then this is it.
Even if you have never played the game before."
18439,Awesome! Fun game!
18440,mmm. very good.
18441,This game really brings back the nostalgic feeling and is very well thought out. It may seem weird but a really good game nonetheless.
18442,"This game was so good, im in the middle of playing of it and phew it brings back some memories from when i was like 7 and playing it. the controlls are a and w are both attacks w is strong but slow and a is fast but low attack. d is a bow s is jump. they also have combos. the arrow keys are movement, it easy to get used to too!"
18443,Sweet treat to play with pals
18444,iz a gud noodle
18445,"Fun game, I love shared/split screen games and this is one of the good ones. Combat isn't overly complex and I can easily play this with the fam."
18446,ok
18447,I just bought it today and the fighting it's so fun and with friends it's even more fun because they can fight with you and revive you but I recommend this game I been playing this since 2012 on the Xbox and decided to get it on steam it's such a good game.
18448,NG OP
18449,"Its a good time waster, that's for sure. sucks if you cant combo though"
18450,It's an enjoyable game
18451,"Good game, but the depth perception on the y-axis can be a little off-putting."
18452,10/10 would fight over women as a white knight again
18453,Great classic side scrolling beat-em-up with a classic arcade feel to it
18454,A game so simply fun that you consider playing the campaign through 30+ times to unlock all the characters
18455,The OG Crusading
18456,good gam very fun me mum beat me though when i wasnt eating dinner
18457,"Lots of fun to play with friends and family. Could be a younger sibling or an older sibling. Heck, the game is simple enough that your mom could pick up a controller and start bashing some enemies (though the later levels DO get tough).
The game may be short but it has a lot of replayability so it's definitely worth a buy even at full price."
18458,Good Game and concept. Lot of input lag and whatnot for myself and friends when trying to play.
18459,Very good game to coop.
18460,epic want sequel
18461,10/10 XBL Arcade classic. But on PC this time!

18467,"Great game! This game is super fun to play even after you beat the game. I loved playing the game most with friends, because we could laugh at all the jokes going on in the background together. This game is worth getting."
18468,It's fun on a bun!!!
18469,i played this with my mate and he got my cat stuck in the toaster. 10/10 wanted him gone anyway great game
18470,"I’ve had a lot of fun on this game, and highly recommend for people who would like to work either by themselves or with a close buddy.  I’ve spent at least 100 hours on the Xbox 360 version of it, and many more on this version of it (soon to have even more hours spent when it comes out on Switch).  Castle Crashers has a lot of fun content in it, all very bright and colorful and fun.  There’s many funny moments in this game, and it is totally worth buying."
18471,"Still able to call this one a fave, it holds up so well and can be replayed with any number of friends. Not a bad one to own"
18472,super fun game for alone and with friends
18473,Isa bop ight just get the game you will have a good time my guy

18482,is good
18483,"Its an amazing game, I got it because I used to play on my xbox 360 and it is still just as good.

After beating the game multiple times it does start to get boring."
18484,Fun game that is very funny and a game in which you can play with friends online
18485,its fun but its pretty broken mechanic wise 7/10
18486,very fun coop game.
18487,"Con 3 amigos más, lo mejor de la vida."
18488,i love this game and all of the content within it. i loved having memories of me and my brother enjoying a coke and killing bosses. i highly reccomend this game. Also thanks for the fun times!
18489,It is very fun and is best experienced while playing with friends.
18490,Fun game will steal gold from friends again.
18491,"A great game with a great art style. 

A really good time with friends.

Definitely buy this game"
18492,Excellent gameplay
18493,The classic
18494,A Classic game. great to play with friends and screw around. You can easily drop a lot of hours into it especially with friends.
18495,The kind of game you can come back to after a decade and still enjoy. An absolute classic in the indie-realm and a timeless button-masher.
18496,"Fun when you have friends to play it with, Other than that it's a waste of money in my opinion.
But if you've got friends unlike me it's a amazing game."
18497,This is probably the best beat em up I've ever played.
18498,A timeless Classic. What else can I say.
18499,must have game to play with friends!
18500,veri gud
18501,Great
18502,yes
18503,"Note before I start, I only have about 0.4h on this game, but I have played it way more than that on other platforms.
Anyways, Castle Crashers is a very good game imo, it has a pretty good story, good gameplay, and fun which will make you want to play for hours, alone or with friends.
You unlock new characters, level them up, get new weapons and beat bosses.
You can get different pets that will help you in different ways, for example the polar bear which mauls enemies (and friends) who are at low HP.

Overall, a very good game which I recommend.
Also, if you like this game, you may also like Battleblock Theater which is a game made by the same developers, Check it out!"
18504,pretty epik
18505,Good game. Highly recommended
18506,Great game and like it as much as when I played it on a console.
18507,Fun and interesting game to play.
18508,"Tons of fun.

I first played the game several years ago on a friends system and the minigame was some hilarious eating competition, waaay more interesting than the now actual minigame nobody wants to play."
18509,"I found this game to be one of the fundamental assets to my collection on Steam, it acted as a building block of what to expect when playing with friends: a grand experience which would live in my memories for an indefinite amount of time. But I digress, as I can say without scruples that you should purchase Castle Crashers."
18510,good
18511,This game is amazing!!!!
18512,nice game
18513,"Very fun, multiplayer works great"
18514,"Great game to play with friends, gfs, bfs, bffs, fwbs, and family if your into that.

18515,"Short and simple review for a short simple game.

You like beat-em-ups from Arcades?
If yes, pick up 3 friends and play this together, its fun, charming, short and enjoyable all the way.
[h1] I really recommend this as a co-op game with some friends, maybe a few drinks, and there you have a really fun time! [/h1]"
18516,More fun with friends.  Especially if they have no idea how to play.

18522,just press 2 button and have fun playing
18523,"Good, Hard game"
18524,hihi
18525,"This is likely the best beat-em-up in the last few years. It is filled with fun combat, colorful and interesting characters and secrets galore! Best played multiplayer."
18526,"this game is amazing to play with friends or alone, its a fun time waster and has lots of replay ability."

18544,PLAY THIS GAYME IF YOU LIKE FIGHTING YOUR FRIENDS TO THE DEATH FOR BITCHES #HOESBEFOREBROS
18545,"I remember when I was first introduced to Castle Crashers via my friend,and since then this has been one of my favorite game of all time.While the game itself isn't that long,there is a ton of replay value.Each time you beat the game with certain character,you will get a new one and I can just go on and on with different character until I complete the game with all of them.There are lots of weapons and pets to collect to.It supports up to 4 player co-op both online and local and me and my friends always have a blast while playing it.The artstyle is perfect,I mean it's truly beautiful,the combat is pretty fun and hard,the bosses feel unique and humor is on top.This is a must play in my opinion,and when you're finished with this masterpiece,you should check other games from The Behemoth.

-I give this game 10/10"
18546,castle fun
18547,Nice game
18548,"Great game, pretty good skill ceiling, and tons of fun with friends. But definitely use a controller for best experience."

18550,v good
18551,This game is 10/10 it perfectly balances humor with action. I thoroughly enjoyed this game from start to finish. It's story is fantastic and I can't stop playing this game. Every time I come back to this game I have just as much fun as the first time I played it. Definitely worth it.
18552,"I have always loved this game. I keep buying it when it pops up on whatever platform I'm on, so that has to say something."

18579,"Nothing in depth, but it's a real fun game to play with a group of friends, and comes in really cheap, making the whole experience easy and practical for playing in groups. Even though this game's been out for years, it's still worth replaying, coming from someone's who had done it multiple times, and the character unlocks at the end of the game always feels rewarding. Would recommend"

18620,Very Cool
18621,amazing game to play with friends
18622,what an epic classic.
18623,"Great Multiplayer and Single Player, I always find my self coming back to this game just to do a quick run through."
18624,You forget you have this in your library. It's fun i guess.
18625,"I really enjoyed this game since I first played it on the Xbox 360 years ago, the mechanics are fun, if a little repetitive, the humor is great, and the story is easy to follow."
18626,Great game
18627,"A game that you could play solo, with friends, or with your 5 yrs old brother. Defeated the game multiple times in the past before purchasing on this account. Downfall would be as soon as you finish the story, that's pretty much it. The other modes doesn't give much hype at all.

Recommended on sale. 

DLC characters are not necessary, you'll unlock characters on the way of completing the game. However, it would've been nice if they had a DLC of additional quests considering how the game has aged throughout the years giving plenty of time for game expansions."
18628,"this is a decent game that is fun to play, however, it can get a little boring after a little while"
18629,I Love this game SOOOOOO MUCH!!
18630,A fun game with Exiciting but a bit hard bosses
18631,Nice game. Best with friends.Good story
18632,"Loved it, alone as well as with friends."
18633,An overall classic I'd play over and over again.

18635,Buy it
18636,Nice
18637,"Amazing Game if you like to mess around and have fun!
Great gameplay and comical storyline.
All around great game."
18638,This game was one of the first lets-plays I watched on Youtube and when I found it on steam I knew I had to play it. I got my friend to get it too and we played it together. Its a must-play especially when its on sale for just a few bucks. If you're looking for a more casual game to play with your friends for a while this is the one you should get. Its really fun and gave us a lot of laughs throughout our time playing.
18639,"This Game Is Very Fun, And Addicting, I Love Everything About It."
18640,An amazingly fun and quirky game that gets even better with friends
18641,Castle Crashers is a super fun game that I remember playing years ago. When I saw it on the steam store I bought it and I loved it. It is just like I how I remember playing it years ago. Super fun game solo but way better with friends!

18649,"Good solo, better with friends."
18650,very gud
18651,Yes
18652,"If played alone: 7/10
If played coop: 420/gaben
Would ragequit because blue knight is OP again."

Pros:
Can play locally or online
Easy to learn controls
Fast paced combat
Optimized graphics that don't require a computer from NASA
Cheap price
No pay to win strats
Not required to play with friends or online
Recommended to play with controller but can still be played with mouse and keyboard
Fast loading time

Cons:
Hmm... not really much
unless you don't like side scrolling

"

18663,"It's a fun, silly beat 'em up with several unlockable characters, and you can multiplay with up to four friends."
18664,This is a fun and great game if you love flash games and new grounds you will fall in love with this simple yet fun adventure 10x better with friends. Buy this game its cheap and worth it.
18665,Great casual game to play with friends!
18666,brings back so many memories and the remaster looks great. absolute classic of a game
18667,I have really fond memories of playing this game as a kid on my friend's xbox and the game is just as awesome. I just wish I could play this game with friends online but the lag and stuttering is difficult to handle.
18668,This game is epic
18669,"whatta ya want from me,

18676,Classic beat-em up style game.
18677,"This game is an icon of my childhood to be honest. I remember sitting down in front of my tv, turning on my xbox 360 and grinding away getting all the characters as a little kid. Brings back so many good memories. An absolute MUST PLAY!"
18678,"This game is very fun with friends, is what I'd say if I had any."
18679,"Probably the best game you can play with your friends, literaly hours of fun."
18680,This game is a great 2d side scrolling game where you can choose to beat up enemies or your friends in a world with tons of levels and characters to collect nearly every enemy in game is possible to get and overall I this is one of the best games I have ever played  along with most of the other behemoth games.
18681,"Game is really fun if you have people over, but gets repetitive after completing the game a couple times"
18682,yes
18683,Yes.
18684,Poured countless hours into this game on Xbox and always bring it up to friends whenever we are bored and looking for something to do.
18685,good game for how old it is.
18686,great fun with friends
18687,Very fun it is old but good at the same time! Get it while its 3.00!
18688,Great fun with friends and a good way to pass time.
18689,nerf insane mode pls
18690,Probably the best beat em up game I've ever played. Only cons I can really think of is that you have to exit to the main menu to switch a character and that the game is pretty short. Otherwise there's lots of fun to be had with this game especially with friends.
18691,very good indie game
18692,I loved playing the demo of castle crashers back when I had my Xbox 360 and being able to play it along with battle block theatre for like around 4 dollars is a great price. I plan on playing castle crahsers to near completion even though beating the game with every character will take a good while
18693,Fun game. Play with friends to have even more fun.8.5/10

18703,One of the best couch coop games. if anyone is still into couch coop this is a mustneed
18704,"Castle Crashers is a very fun game you can play with your friends. Not only can you watch your friend struggle defeating a boss while doing 1-2 damage on it and not doing the thing they need to do and basically you screaming for them to hit the goddamn furball but that never happens and goddamn EZRA HIT THE FURBALL. Ahem 

Great game! Play with friends!"

18743,"really fun game, easy to get into, hard to get out of :p"
18744,"I have had this game on the Xbox 360 and this game was part of my childhood right alongside Minecraft and Terraria. I played this game with my friends and my brother and had a lot of fun. We have a lot of hours on this game in the xbox and when i saw you can get 4 copys for yourself and for a friend, i got it and started playing with 4 players in the lobby. It was a blast. 8/10 would recommend."

18770,"Bro i love this game, bring back so many memories when i played it when i was younger, fun to play with your friends."
18771,neat
18772,"Castle Crashers is one of the most fun games I've ever encountered. I have played this game since I was a child, I first got to play it at a friends house, and I instantly got into it. I loved the art style, the characters, and overall the gameplay. Now, the only con that I can say about this game is that, it can get quite boring playing alone sometimes. I recommend that you FIRST play through the game alone, then you should invite your friends so that you get a understanding of the game and the do's and don'ts. This game is also really fucking hard, especially INSANE mode. The game's difficulty is increased by alot, enemies does more damage, bosses takes longer to kill, and If I recall correctly the bosses get's NEW attacks, only to make you even more frustrated. But that's my opinion. Basically: Play either alone or with friends (For the best experience play with friends), and take some breaks. Because you WILL need it. Good luck!"
18773,"Excellent game to run through the Steamlink with a couple of controls.  Simple enough to pick up and understand how it works, but difficult enough that there is depth to the combat.  Still, if a boss is too difficult, you'll keep levelling until it is easier.  Has the same fun animations and motif as other titles by these developers.  Heartily recommended."
18774,good game
18775,Just as good as I remember it when I had it on Xbox 360. Its perfect with some friends and def good for same hours esp in the arena. 10/10 perfect on PC.
18776,A lot of fun with friends.
18777,Top
18778,Crusade Simulator!
18779,Pretty good game for people who just love having fun
18780,"Solid side scrolling fighter! Lots of RPG elements to let you fine tune your fighting style and characters have different elemental attacks. And for me, It's one of the few games I enjoy playing again with a new character after I've beat it.
Like Streets Of Rage, Double Dragon, Golden Axe and TMNT Arcade, this one keeps the spirit of great co-op fighting games.
Perfect game for rookie and veteran gamers alike.

(P.S. - I sunk over 200 hrs. on the PS3, the port to PC is well done and leaves nothing out!)"
18781,Really good game! You don't know what you're missing if you don't have this game! Really fun with friends
18782,This game is very good. I played it when I was a little kid and now I got it on my pc and all the nostalgia is flowing in.
18783,Fun to plat with friends.
18784,Button smashing has never been so fun
18785,Always loved this game since xbox :)
18786,I like it.

18788,A fun multiplayer game.
18789,Very good

18791,A great game
18792,"Relived childhood with this game. Classic.

Would Recommend!"
18793,It's definitely better with friends. The gameplay can get a little stale without some friendly banter to keep things fresh.
18794,"This is a good ass game, used to play it a long time ago on my Xbox 360, how times have changed."
18795,I thought it was awesome!my  favorite  character was the red knight.my favorite level was cyclop's fortress
18796,"This game will keep you entertainment for HOURS with the silly humor, variety of characters, and truly amazing story. Some levels can be pretty tough at times, but once you max out your stats, it's a breeze and you feel so powerful. If the regular campaign was too easy for you, there's also a ""puzzle"" mode, an even harder campaign, and online arena fights."
18797,"A really good game,easy with friends but is a little bit harder alone
"
18798,Pretty lit
18799,Good game 8/10
18800,I like this game
18801,very epic! a true epic game!
18802,For an old game this has retained its age. its very well done and i do highly recommend it.
18803,"Love this game, lol. Haven't played it in years but it's aged well and is very iconic to me. 

Although, I'd give it a: 0/10, there's not enough cats. Obviously."
18804,"Ready for a bash? Play some Castle Crashers! Seriously, this game is fun and has a very cool art style. Reminds me of those old arcade beat em up classics you would play in the arcades."
18805,bruh good gam
18806,"A classic, grab some buddies and go wild with this blast from the past game for reals"
18807,CLASSIC GAME BESY EVER OH YEAHHHH

18810,Very goood game. I like it!
18811,"AMAZING game Even though its age can be diserning it is an honurable game
"
18812,good
18813,100/10 would recommend
18814,i love this game. i think i have introduced it to at least 8 people as a fun multiplayer game
18815,This is the best game I have ever played in me life
18816,Quit reading and go Crash some Castles!
18817,"Very fun, i completed the game a while ago and it's still very entertaining. Definitely a Mouse murderer though."
18818,"Castle Crashers is the perfect game to play with friends and with the arena mode you can destroy friendships and with the story mode you can build them back up I recommend this game for any occasion.
The single player mode has a lot lacking to make it my favourite game but besides that I can play this for so many hours and now after finding it on Steam I will play it for many many more."
18819,It good and fun.
18820,"Fantstic party game, its a must have."
18821,very good came very creative!
18822,Amazing replay value with friends and a fantastic game overall.
18823,This game is quite fun to just play for hours on end!

18825,its great
18826,hella good game
18827,Good to kill time
18828,This game is very fun to play with friends and it is easy to get used to.
18829,Delicia de jogo
18830,"One of the first Games I had on Steam. great fun in solo play and even greater fun in coop play. Nice Partygame or just something for a quick but also challenging time.
Definitely recommended. Didn't change my profile pic ever since"
18831,COOOOOOCK
18832,Solid game that is enjoyable either couch co-op or online with up to 3 friends. The story is hilarious and it has lots of replay value and even a more difficult mode once you beat the game. Would recommend it to anyone since the requirements to play it are really low almost anyone can play it
18833,One of the best beat em up games I've ever played
18834,this is game that is pretty good
18835,"Castle crashers is a fun game mixing the 3D and the 2D, The goal of the game is mainly to save the pricesses but also to have a lot of fun.
the story is not really explained and will not be explained through the game but it's pretty easy for a quick understanding

The player can incarn many different knight whit different power.
You can also unlock new knight during the game but unfortunatly each knight have his own achievement.For exemple if you played 10 hours whit the fire knight you need to start agan if you switch to the ice knight.Luckely you don't loose the progress you did whit another knight.

the control are pretty simple, you can play whit a mouse and a keyboard, only whit a keyboard, but the game recommend to play with a controller.
I personnaly use keyboard only but i'll switch to a controller when possible.

The game itself is pretty simple, no need to learn a lot of combo and people who spam random keys can beat the game. However sometimes you'll need to use what we call a brain to find some quick tactic to defeat a boss and to observe theirs attacks.

The game can be played alone or whit max 3 friends.
At the moment i'm playing alone, you can do like me but i think soon we will need the help of other players if we block at a point.
Friends can use a controller or a keyboard as well ( it's more harder cause you can't use the same keys)

it's not a game you beat in less than 5 hours except if you tryhard and u already play it 37 times.

now for the grades i give

graphics (not compare to other game like AAA one, more for the graphics for this game and this type of game) : 88/100
story : 75/100
gameplay : 83/100
fun : 85/100
addictivity : 80/100
price / quality : 84/100 or 88/100 during sale
difficutly : 7/10

overall : very good game

( to avoid : 1 to 20 / very bad : 20 to 35 / bad 35 to 50 / to think of 50 to 60 / good 60 to 75 / vey good 75 to 90 / extremly good 90 to 100)

is it hard to take in hand : NO
do i need a controller : NO but recommended

can i play in mutliplayer : YES whit 3 peoples
can i play in local : YES whit 3 peoples"
18836,"The best beat em up game ever made.
-4 player co-op
-4 players fighting over Giraffey 
-Ha Ha Deer go poo"
18837,"Awesome game, what else can I say? Wish there was a sequel."
18838,It's a classic.
18839,Pretty quirky
18840,Still to this day provides hours of entertainment for me and my son on a weekly basis.
18841,great for mind numbing fun w/ friends
18842,This Game is great and it has huge replayability and tons of weapons and pets to unlock like characters so you can play the game over and over again and you wont get bored i just hope maybe the game gets updated again so it adds even more stuff
18843,"Bought this for my little siblings, they loved it."
18844,Fun little game to enjoy with a group of friends.
18845,"Pretty good game, a lot of fun with friends! 
Online's a bit wacky with having input lag, so that sucks, but still pretty good.

18848,very fun
18849,good
18850,"Castle Crashers; the game that will make you love brawlers, even if you never did. Outstanding humor, ever-changing themes and enemies and a hell of a lot of fun.
If you are looking for a fun co-op game, or just something to break down laughing with your friends, you have come to the right place."
18851,ebic
18852,"It's a mayhem of comical violence and good times.
Very much like playing the flash games from Newgrounds, and wouldn't you know it, it IS made by guys that made the games on Newgrounds.
Awesome!"
18853,I would recommend this game for anyone with friends that enjoy that good old fashioned couch co-op gameplay
18854,bruh
18855,Good
18856,"It's an absolute classic. If you enjoy beat em up games, you'll fall in love with castle crashers just like I did. The game has a lot of charm, and with the dozens of characters to unlock you'll have tons of different ways to play the game."
18857,Great game
18858,An amazing game that has lasted with me through time. It's been years since I got it and I still revisit it to this day.
18859,Fun game to play with friends.
18860,I hadn't laughed out loud this much during a game since the last time I looked at the hours played counter on whichever rpg I happen to be wasting my life on at the moment... Castle Crashers is brilliant!
18861,"The game is amazing the comedy is great and its quite fun.
10/10 would play again
"
18862,Playing local multiplayer with my friends and that was such a great time and experience! If thats what you want the game for I would say IT IS worth it. Thanks for reading :)
18863,This is a really good game that I enjoy playing both alone and with friends. It may seem boring and repeatable but when you play it you know it's not. The Insane mode after you complete the game is a bit too difficult even with an almost maxed out character that's probably my only complaint.
18864,"I played this game with a friend who had already completed it, nevertheless I still enjoyed myself so much just casually running through the game. I played it with a lot of different friends and just can't stop enjoying it every single run through. I do recommend it."
18865,Great beat em up fun for 1-4 people.
18866,very fun with friends.

18878,10/10 Great soundtrack great coop great story great game. I recommend to all.
18879,i hope this game is not dead if it is it's not for me
18880,"if you max defense i dont know what wrong with you. greatest time of my life, friends cant kill me"
18881,Great co-op game
18882,Absolutely love it!
18883,"This game was a great experience, and i loved it. The humor in the game is hilarious"
18884,"Um clássico dos jogos indies, e um dos melhores que ja joguei. É divertido de qualquer forma, com amigos, ou até mesmo sozinho. O único problema é que começa a ficar meio repetitivo, mas tirando isso, é perfeito de todas as formas, a arte, as fases no estilo beat em' up, os chefes, todos equilibrados de acordo com seus níveis."
18885,This game is really good game and I really like it.
18886,After all these years this game is still fun.  Worth every penny no matter how much you pay for it. Stop reading reviews and go play this!
18887,That music though
18888,A classic that still holds up. Great for jumping in and having some fun.
18889,fun
18890,amazing game but none of my controllers work for it xD
18891,"An absolute classic!

This game is fun by yourself but it is highly recommended to play with friends (even better with couch co-op). Nostalgic music from Newgrounds, great art (thanks Behemoth for adding ULTRA settings!) and fun gameplay! If you haven't played this already, play it now. As of writing the review Castle Crashers is dirt cheap at £1.99, there's no reason not to get it!"
18892,"I recommend playing this game with friends, seriously its lots of fun for hours to play. Its easy to control, has nicely done 2d graphics and great soundtrack. And the little ""story"" it has, will make you laugh constantly ;)."
18893,"Nice game, would be more fun if I had friends LOL"
18894,Solid co-op game
18895,"A lot more to practice and do, hellas old but hellas good"
18896,"Fun with friends, 8/10"

18901,"+ Great game for coop

Overall: 8/10"
18902,"Funny playing alone, funnier with 3 more idiots"
18903,Timeless.
18904,brilliant game
18905,"It's like Cuphead but multiplayer and more fun. This game is super fun with friends, even with just one friend to play it with. It definitely gets more fun with the increase of players. There are different characters and different playstyle which you can match with your friends. The only way I can really describe the gameplay with words is that it is like Cuphead, lots of bosses. Each level is like a 'run and gun' and has a boss at the end. Super cool and there are cool features as well. I recommend getting it on the summer sale for SUPER cheap. This game is definitely worth to play with your friends."
18906,this game is just fucking amazing and really fun
18907,Game is pretty cool
18908,"Not easy

18913,this is a fun game to play with friends and just have a chill time
18914,BEST GAME ON STEAM!

18933,"I recommend the game, but when playing a 4 man, while there's me, an Asian playing with 3 Californians, *really* screws up the game to a point that everyone's desynced except for two people typically. Everyone's either dead, alive, or swinging at nothing and dying."
18934,its what you would expect.
18935,Its fun
18936,"This game is best enjoyed with friends, thats it"
18937,super fun and classic
18938,"A wonderful, classic beat-em-up, that's honestly best enjoyed with your buddies. And with multiple characters, leveling up and re-doing it is quite possible! Enemy variety and strengths will keep you and your friends on your toes the whole way through, whilst keeping you laughing with the comedy."
18939,"Have about 500 hours in this game on my Xbox one, love this game to bits. It's good in about every way, except for industrial castle on insane mode. Fuck you for making that level. 400 damage per hit from those damn enemies. Fuck you Behemoth games."
18940,very good would game more but to busy being awesome #swag
18941,bruh
18942,live this game
18943,"I don't even have to play this game long to give it an amazing review. I'v literally put in many hours on the Xbox 360 whenever this game came out. And hell it has never changed. An amazing beat em up, side scroller. Even the little jokes the game puts in it makes it even a shit ton better. Now I will say playing his game can get boring fairly quick so I recommend playing with friends, a whole better experience. Again an amazing game from my childhood and has never changed.

9/10"
18944,yes

"
18963,fun
18964,"Love it, great game to play with some friends and mess around"
18965,"I like holistic games, with deep philosophical concepts plus an oneiric environment and well-rounded characters that have their unique voice without being obnoxious or clichéd. 
 

But I also like Castel Crashers ® with comedy at their finest. (Like a deer propelled by its own shit). 
 
Pro’s: 

1. I can play it off-line single player thus avoiding racism. (Also avoiding little kids gaming while stuck at limbo yelling “Reeeee!”). 
2. Gameplay is great; simple hack and slash with funny weapons and cool magic spells. 
3. Music is great too! 
4. Art! All the visual aspects of the game are breathtaking like Keanu Reeves. (When I wrote this, I misspelled Keanu and Word corrected it for me; Why does my orthography proofing thingy knows how to spell Keanu!?). 
5. I can use my expensive Xbox PC compatible gamepad. 
6. And the deer propelled by diarrhea."
18966,;)
18967,How could you not love this classic? Better with friends.

19002,"After more than a decade of play between Steam and Xbox Live I can confidently say that this game is still worth returning to. Whether it's a significant other or a younger relative who is trying to get into gaming Castle Crashers remains one of the best couch co-op experiences with a low barrier to entry, tons of bright and colorful characters, and fun loot and animals to grind for. If you've never played this classic grab a controller and some friends and have a blast."

19078,Its good with freinds
19079,"This is a really good game, accidently deleted my save data, however, it was me being stupid and not the game, unlike my review of HL2. Fun and funny, try it sometime, it's one of the only games that's fun to grind."
19080,The best game of all time

19125,"I had so00 much fun playing this game. If you want to double or triple the fun, play it with your loved ones or friends. You will not be able to hold yourself and not laugh. You will die out of laughter and fun. When the game finishes, the second round begins and it's hardcore and tough. still on chapter 1 ... :)"
19126,wow this game get boring in 2 seconds lamest $15 i ever spent
19127,I'm here because of steam grand prix also this game is good.
19128,Harder than Dark Souls
19129,"This game is still pretty fun after all these years  If you enjoy beat em up this is a must for your collection.  However, with that said,  magic is pretty op. You can spam it all day solo and complete it."
19130,Still an awesome game and for 3$ on sale you cant beat it. Get the 4 pack and make it a party.
19131,"The xbla classic comes to steam, great as ever."
19132,"What a classic, amazing game. If you don't know Castle Crashers was a hit Xbox 360 Arcade game back when it first released in 2008. 1-4 player beat em up adventure with colorful knights each with their own set of powers, with more to unlock. Right now with the game on sale at 2.99 and 9.99 for a 4 pack there is no reason this game is not apart of your library. Get some friends to play through the entire game with and depending how hard of a completionist you might be you have tons of hours to sink in. You don't need a long detailed review for this game, if you were looking for your sign to buy it this is it."
19133,"Lindo, vale la pena con amigos"

...also poop jokes. lots and lots of poop jokes."
19173,"Great game to play with friends.

19184,Fuck. What a classic. Get a buddy and mash shit
19185,Such a nice game to play with your friends.
19186,The developers bring a sense of humour to this fun party game.
19187,Relax and get MAD
19188,"The game is an older classic beat'em up game. It is very VERY enjoyable and relaxing. I have lots of fun playing single player, and it is even better when i play with other people. Castle Crashers also has an incredible amount to replay-ability."
19189,very good game
19190,"Despite simple side scrolling mechanics, there is a surprising amount of depth to this indie hack-n-slash."
19191,"Good game, pretty fun."
19192,THIS GAME BIG POPS OFF TRUST ME
19193,"It's one of the classic early ""indie"" games and it still holds up."
19194,"I tricked my friend into thinking we wouldn't PVP in the campaign and instantly killed him with an arrow.

He's eating mass amounts of shit while I'm eating mass amounts of princess face with my kissing technique."
19195,Xbox 360 Arcade classic brought to steam. Really enjoyable with friends.
19196,Game is fun
19197,Good ol' memories of back in the day
19198,Loads of fun!
19199,you punch stuff
19200,It's pretty good
19201,"Spent a decent amount playing and I'd say it's quite a good game. Played through it a bunch of times to get all the characters (even though i had accidentally wiped all my progress at one point) and I'm decently close? I don't have a character at max level yet, but this a party enjoyed with friends although I have had fun playing myself the experience increased tenfold when I played with them."
19202,Super fun.
19203,great game
19204,"This is a game that anyone can pick up, play and laugh at together whether it's with controllers locally or online with strangers. It's a side-scrolling, side-swimming, beat-em-up, boss-em-up, level-em-up, addicting, peas-got-into-your-mashed-potatoes casual, hardcore game that's way easier to play than it is to explain. I've already invested a lot of time into the PS3 version but somehow found myself doing the same here because it's worth repeating, which is a rare case since most games get criticized for being too repetitive. Castle Crashers and subsequent Behemoth games show that it takes a lot of heart and honesty to make a fun and engaging game that can last generations. There doesn't need to be a Castle Crashers 2 the same way there doesn't need to be a Team Fortress 3: When the game is already perfect, there doesn't need to be another."
19205,A classic game. 10/10
19206,I enjoyed playing this game on the xbox 360 and I still enjoy this game on the PC. Would recommend it to others.
19207,10/10 game :D
19208,Fun
19209,Very fun couch co-op game!

19221,a classic
19222,great game played since it came out on Xbox now bought it here

19231,Good. Lots of epic memories. Classic
19232,"Good game definitely a keeper and is good to play with friends!

10/10 would play again and again!"
19233,"A game with a one time story, but it's fun when you play again anyways. Mostly because the different characters all for more playing because, although it's the same story, same game, but different characters allow for different gameplay. It's really fun."
19234,"Caaara, esse jogo é incrível... Tem ótima jogabilidade, trilha sonora frenética e muito boa, que as vezes vc para de jogar só pra escutar as músicas. O jogo tem gráficos relativamente bons, (considerando que ele é cartoon) e tem várias coisas pra liberar, dando assim vontade de jogar e não enjoar."
19235,Worth my time.
19236,It's toasty.

19238,"I have 500+ hours on the Xbox version of the game. The story and levels are always replay-able and you can always start fresh with a new knight. I love this game, definitely a must have, especially during the sale when it is $3.99."
19239,Fun game with friends!
19240,"best game in the world 1111
"
19241,Its fun but its not really my type and also it gets repetitive after the first few levels. yes i've had this game for a while but found it fun but it was a decent game and would recommend!
19242,what are you waiting for? just buy the damn thing
19243,10/10. So fun. So humorous. Best played with friends.
19244,Fun :)
19245,"Super fun, love the animation and charcters!"
19246,"This game takes me back, super fun. Highly recommend using a controller over keyboard+mouse."
19247,"Absolutely fantastic game. simple but extremely fun, especially if played with friends as appears to be intended. Only issue is after the first few times you've played through it, it gets very repetitive. It can, however, still be played if in the company of the correct people.
10/10."
19248,"Castle Crashers is a really good Co-Op RPG. I don't really have much bad to say about it besides the fact that the difficulty spikes around half-way through the game. Also, the game is sadly pretty short."
19249,garbage and i promise i've never seen anything more doodoo
19250,"I was really reluctant on buying this game for a while, especially at the regular price, so I waited for the Steam Sale (3 dollars seems very dandy!).

And oh boy I sure did wait for the best time to see why I wasn't sure on this game.

Personally, I like the ""humor"" and the visuals, plus the complex gameplay (especially since I'm on a keyboard). Sadly, this game is GREATLY reccomended for multiplayer, absolutely. Being played solo feels barren and desolate, while being overwhelmed by enemies. I guess the developers didn't think too much for a single player experience. 

I do understand beat 'em ups as usually being single player playthroughs, and they do benefit by having the opportunity of having an extra player (double the fun, right?). But this game? It kinda falls flat if you're a complete lone wolf.

If you have friends and are as equally interested to play this game, then go for it. Singleplayer-wise? Not so much."
19251,"One of my favourite games to play
"
19252," If you have not played this game you're seriously missing out.
Beat it years ago and bought it for PC just because I like it so much."
19253,Fun game.
19254,can i refund 3 hours of my day back? i accidentally played through 3 until 6 and i has essay to do

19256,Besides minecraft this is the best game ive ever played hands down
19257,"one of the best games i have ever played , i really recomend it .
it's really silly and funny and a must have game plus it's really fun when played multiplayer or splitscreen ."
19258,Its a lot of fun. Best with friends.
19259,Simply 10/10
19260,i love this game so much i have the xbox version  too!!!
19261,"I've played games for years upon years upon years... and this is by far one of the best games i have ever seen. the audio can be funny or insanely dramatic, like the river level when you fight the chieftan vs when you beat the game and unveil the last princess. an amazing cast of characters and just overflowing with nostagia. truly this is a game for the ages. 420/69 would play for eternity."
19262,esta chipolcudo
19263,Great game
19264,One of the most nostalgic games that has infinite replay value. If the game is on sale then you have to pick it up!
19265,Heck.

19271,"I have no words fore this is classic 
I fell in love with the art and the dumb humor
10/10"
19272,"A fun Beat em' Up with lots of colorfull characters with their own powers and habilities. It can be beaten in less than five hours tho there aren't so many levels. If you play alone you will be grinding experience points because some bosses are damage sponges that were thought to fight in co-op. Overall is a great game for the price it costs.
[h1]7.5/10[/h1]"
19273,"This game is a classic for all major gamers. This game has been incredible and is always a fun relaxing game to play. If you guys are looking for a nice arcade game and an amazing 4 player story to play, this is it! There are so many characters to unlock and a ton of weapons to find through out the game. The achievements aren't crazy hard to get and the gameplay is super straight forward. Don't mistake my review because I only have almost 6 hours in it. I played this game endlessly through high school on the Xbox 360. Anyways, the amount of entertainment you get from this game for the price is unbeatable."
19274,"I fight corn on the cob, and i beat muscly people at volleyball on rooftop

is good game
"
19275,"i remember playing this years ago, glad i bought this again! so many great memories! it's a pretty simple game, but super enjoyable and the art is one of a kind!"
19276,Another great party game from the developer. It's fun to play with your friends or alone.
19277,"The game stars a group of four unique knights who are out to kick the asses of other knights, a cyclops, a giant cat-fish, factory workers, monstrous oceans with ninja pirates, and alien invaders. 

They're only doing this to save the daughters of several useless kings, to obtain a totally not Chaos Emerald from Sonic, and defeat a dark lord. As this is a Newgrounds game, you will expect a generic ass lol random XD story for an already boring as fuck game. 

Please go play Street of Rage 2 on Sega Genesis if you don't hate your friend's intelligence."
19278,Classic
19279,"I love the art style for this game it is very unique. The game in general is interesting, it has a funny story. A good combat combat system I would recommend a controller though. The game is quite long as well for a indie game. The bosses are all different with different attacks and different zones. The game is around 10 hours long plus extreme mode which is always fun to play, so around 20 to 30 hours of gameplay. This game is quite a classic and a good game to play with friends."
19280,"Hundreds of hours on console, this game is one of the best games i've ever played. Other games like it are ""Battleblock Theater"" and ""Alien Hominid HD"". This game is a must multiplayer game for the maximum enjoyment, pick up a copy for your friends and hop in and immerse yourself in beautiful soundtrack, extraordinary enemies and last but not least bosses. Lots of them, and they're all different and cool in their own little way.

Somewhere in 2019 summer it will be released for Switch, YES. They are keeping this game alive years later, and i really admire the devs for this."
19281,You usually want friends to play this game with but I don't have any ;(
19282,"Excellent game, I reccomend if your into beat em ups with good story elements. Childish yet funny humor games amazing. One of my favorites!"
19283,"good
"
19284,"Castle Crashers is an excellent beat-em-up with tight controls and mechanics, cool iconic art, and catchy music. You can play with up to 3 other players locally or online. Personally, I completed the campaign [strike]forever[/strike] alone, just by myself... and had a blast!

To me, Castle Crashers is a Steam classic, and a must-have for anyone who enjoys beat-em-ups. Recommended, even at full price!"
19285,"It's an okay game, would benefit from a massive update or a second one, cuz' this feels like a flash game."
19286,It's freaking amazing. That's all I got to say.
19287,This game never gets old. Very fun to play local with friends. 8/10
19288,Good Game
19289,yes
19290,hell of a game

19294,10/10
19295,"I played the demo version on Steam.

I mostly played the game on Xbox though. And I loved it."
19296,I love this is so FUN and i just finish a game like 4 times I LIKE IT !  ! !  :)
19297,Amoizing
19298,"tho don't have many hours on pc, this game made up most of my childhood and i invested hundreds of hours into this game on console and is one of the greatest games i have ever played. would recommend to anyone who thinks of picking up this game"
19299,"The gameplay itself is pretty minimal but the soundtrack, artstyle and humor really make up for it, its very fun to play with friends and i reccomend it."
19300,dis shit good
19301,"It seems this game was designed to be played with 4 people. I played it with my cousin and we couldn't tolerate the difficulty anymore at the Lava World level. The game is unfairly difficult, with enemies using cheap tactics like constantly rolling behind you (with you unable to see them because there are so many things going on on the screen) and sometimes being bullet (sword?) sponges. 
Leveling up doesn't really make you stronger and you need to grind to beat some levels. 
The combat becomes quite tedious after the first 4-5 levels and the magic system leaves a lot to be desired; it's too simple.
The sound effects and the soundtrack is just meh.
All in all, I can't recommend this game. I bought this game thinking it would be a great couch co-op game, but it turned out a mediocre one. There are much better co-op games on Steam, so I advise skipping this."
19302,I'M ADDICTED TO THIS GAME!!!!
19303,"garbage boring game. all characters play about the same and move around very slowly. you have a stunlock from using abilities, whether it's using main weapon, magic, or jumping, which you do all the time, so you're always pushing a button, waiting a second, pushing a button, waiting a second... while the enemies attack you non stop. and i'm not talking about how you have to wait for your character to land back on the ground. i'm talking about how you have to wait when your character actually lands back to the ground, cause that's when you start waiting for the ~1 second recovery. the dimensional area of the game play is garbage aswell, it's hard to tell whether you're aligned to hit an enemy or not, and when you're supposed to dodge you don't. magic is useless garbage. mobs are overpowered and with the garbage controls it's very hard and slow to progress past 20 or 30 levels and we have to start from the beginning of each level everytime. bosses are bullshit overpowered too. the game is not fun and is using gross humor.. stupid people find that funny. graphics are bland, controls are shit, gameplay is shit and frustrating, there's no fun in this game if you're not a retard"
19304,"I let my mate win at the end knowing full well what his reward would be, 10/10."
19305,bad game. bad people.
19306,"they have so much health i cant kill them
bosses are easy if your friend doesnt die or get knocked so you have to revive"
19307,hella nice
19308,this is one of the best games here on steam
19309,Fun AF
19310,good game yes
19311,"It's one of the best games I ever played  (especially with friends), I would really recommend you to buy this game and play with a few of your friends!"
19312,Arkadşlarınla oynayınca sarıyo
19313,This game is great! I would recommend Castle Crashers to many people simply because of the humor aspect in it.
19314,A fantastically fun and silly co-op adventure.  The silly art and story really grow on you. A fun party game.
19315,Probably one of the best local/online coop games here on steam

19323,it needs the necromancer pack dlc that is one of the main reasoons i bought it other than that it is really awesome
19324,foda.
19325,"This game
is the best game, honestly it is my favourite game.
the only negative i have about it is that the story is very linear, as you HAVE to do each level in order to complete it. But it was released in like 2008, give it a break.
It is the best game to play with friends, lots of laughs, immature humour and good times. There is single player but it is REALLY hard and no where near as fun."
19326,"A fun game when played with friends and alone. The voice acting is great as always and the boss battles were challenging. Some levels I had to restart many times and had raged quit many other times, but at the end it was a very nice experience."
19327,peak
19328,OG Game <3
19329,"I absolutely love this game. First off, the art style is simple, yet appealing and has its own aesthetic to it that only makes me enjoy the game even more. Even the most meanest bosses or animal orbs could look so adorable in Dan Paladin's iconic style, and I just love that so much! The game is very well-detailed and the artwork definitely does not falter from the tiny expressions on their faces when they take damage to the breathtaking background scenery of each stage.  Secondly, the gameplay has that nostalgic (or even retroish) feel to it that makes me feel like I'm playing a really well-made game back in my elementary school days. I really love how well they pulled the side-scroller system off so well. Insane Mode is also an amazing concept that keeps the game from getting repetitive as well as the fact that you unlock more characters by finishing the story with other characters. 
In all honesty, my only complaint about Castle Crashers is how you can barely even find anyone to play with online, but it's a simple fix by hitting up some friends and getting on a match together. 
Well done, Behemoth! You never fail to amaze me with your games. I thank my younger self for getting into your games such as Alien Hominid. Keep up the good work! (:"

Its nice if you have a friend, you can mess around, laugh at the humor, try various things, its really just a great experience, some replayability too, but mostly with other friends. The singleplayer mode tho. . . I havent bothered completing it, it doesnt seem that fun. I would still recommend this if you have a friend or two."

19344,"This game is amazing. Love playing with friends, family and etc. 10/10"
19345,Really fun game to play with a friend!
19346,"This game is by far one of the best side-scrolling games of all time. The game offers so much replayability that you will most likely 
 find yourself coming back to this game time and time again. I would highly recommend this game for casual gamers. For people that like a challenge, their is also an insane mode that is extremely difficult. The game is also very funny. Never taking itself too seriously. The only problems I find with this game is that 1.) To unlock some of the characters, you have to play solo, which is pretty boring and 2.) Like I said a little bit ago, you pretty much have to play with friends in order to get the true authentic experience. Playing by yourself is not horrible, but it can get old quick. I would definitely recommend picking up the 4-pack and play with your friends. After that, you got yourself one fantastic game!"
19347,"This game is amazing:
- Has lots of replay value 
- Boss encounters are fun
- Creative art style
- Many characters to play as"
19348,"Has it's moments in party mode, but effectively 720p and sometimes obscure gameplay mechanics won't let me recommend it."
19349,10/10
19350,Used to play this with my friends back in the day. Recently started playing with new friends and I forgot how enjoyable it was. Brought back so many good memories :)
19351,"Lots of fun with friends . Never fails to surprise you . When you think you've seen everything the game has to Offer . It throws something different at you . 
Get it!!"
19352,"This was a fun game . There should be more games like this out there , unlike Dota 2 which is a pile of crap ."
19353,One of the best beat em ups ever created great art and sound design. Could not recommend it more. I got this for my Xbox 360 I missed it so much that I bought it for PC.
19354,The Behemoth never fails to make amazing games. It combines serious moments with their own touch of humor.
19355,"Good game for child , funny"
19356,One of the best multiplayer experiences I've ever had!
19357,"This is my childhood, and what a childhood it was."
19358,obama approves of this game. very fun and good for the family.
19359,you can kill your friends
19360,One of the best indie games ever made hands down. It has it all. Excellent fluid gameplay that stands up to multiple playthroughs. 9/10
19361,"One of the best games ever released on Newgrounds. The humor is very dated in my opinion but the gameplay is so much fun. The game itself has a lot of replay value as it has like a new game plus called insane mode after you're done with the main campaign. There is also local and online co-op mode so you don't have to sit and play all on your own all the time.

But then there is Back Off Barbarian. It is a very unfair mini game with barbarians chasing after you in a disclosed area. The map changes every time you play it so there's not a great possibility to develop any strategy for it. The movement is just you pressing the correct, random, button on the next tile you want to go on, which gets frustrating after the amount and speed of the barbarians increase. There is an achievement on which you have to survive in this game mode for 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

That's really the only complaint I have, so it's overall a game as solid as my excrement."
19362,hey anyone wanna play and you should def play the best game in my libary!
19363,"One of the best games ever, this is amazing"
19364,good
19365,"Aged like my grandma. 
She's dead."
19366,"Sadly I feel as though the game only works as a co-op, and since there are so few people able to play along with you it is not practical to enjoy the game. The game itself is fantastic, innovative in its co-op initiatives, art styles, and gameplay/story. So if you have a group of friends, or can find a gang to play with than it is absolutely worth it. It has fair replay value as well, though the story is long enough to keep you entertained for quite a while."
19367,"Castle Crashers is a slash-em-up type game illustrated in a cartoony fashion. 

Pros:
[list]
[*] I liked the cartoony graphics.
[*] Fun to play with friends (is also OK solo).
[*] Was moderately funny.
[*] Controls were adequate.
[*] Fun to collect pets and weapons (and to a lesser extent new toons for future runs).
[/list]

Cons: 
[list]
[*] Becomes repetitive after a while. For me this happened midway thru my first runthrough on the harder difficulty level.
[*] Weapons fairly uninspired in effects.
[/list]

Overall: It is definitely worth it to play this through one time, especially if you have friends nearby. You may not get a ton of time out of this one, but if you pick it up on sale it should be well worth the money. The mindless (in a good way) gameplay is relaxing.

Rating: 7/10"

It was important for me to have a game that my parents could play as well; they often get confused and overwhelmed with video games but Castle Crashers has been a hit so far. It's fun to play alone, but even better with someone else.

I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. This is a steam must."
19373,Great game! love the graphics and multiplayer! (^w^)-------L
19374,"I haven't played this game much on pc but that is because I played it on the ps3 a long time ago and had an absolute blast, the simple gameplay makes it very fun and enjoyable. This game is definitely designed to be played with friends so I heavily suggest doing that. While it's still fun to play alone, it doesn't come close to the fun you can have with friends in this game."

19383,it's good
19384,"It's a very good time consumer, and really fun to play with friends!"
19385,"witch ever one of you made that beach ball BS DESERVES TO BURN IN HELL


 k that was just rage because i got stuck like for a week on that part in the desert castle. this game is the best i have played in a long damn time. been a Behemoth fan sense alien hominid.
this is the first beat-um-up and best i've ever played, the colors, humor(#shit jokes for life) there to good. the enemies are amazing each one feeling unique and instantly recognizable even if the ice dudes are just slightly different thief its still good my personal favorite enemy is either the Coneheads or the Snakelers( i believe thats what the green dudes are called). the bosses of castle crashers probably tie it all together the game would'nt be the same each on serveing a purpose, you cant skip a single boss witch i love ALL the bosses are amazing my favorite being Necromancer or Cyclops. lastly the music, amazing if castle crashers had no music i probably would'nt have finished it the first time you hear them its hard to desribe but you know what i mean from Waterflame to Fakefaction its good music. all in all this game is fan-damn-tastic its totally worth your 15 bucks hell ida payed 20"
19386,Fun!
19387,"This game is very fun. However, there are a  few problems that i have encountered. First of all, this game was very heavily designed for an xbox 360 controller. You are able to play with keyboard, but i advise that you immediately change the key bindings. I was able to connect a wired nintendo switch controller but received a lot of stick drift. (may just be my controller) This game is extremely easier on multiplayer, either online or local. My friend and i played with me on keyboard and he on controller, and we had a great time. The different characters have unique magical talents that are all great in certain situations. I found that this game is very hard while playing single player. While playing this game i had a whole lot of fun. at the end i left only wishing that it was longer. You can unlock many different knights by finishing the game!

I give my extremely unofficial completionist rating of finish it, as there is not very much to do after finishing the main campaign than the newly unlocked mode with increased difficulty. However it is extremely fun to find all of the pets and increase your collection of weapons. Leveling up is still an extremely fun treat as you can increase your stats with skill points. I love this game and highly recommend it."
19388,im love this game
19389,"The controls on pc are whack but they do us the courtesy of reccomending a controller. Besides that and the fact that this game reeks of early 2000's game, it's a must play classic. Better with friends. Silly and fun."
19390,Really fun to play with friends!
19391,Great game when playing with friends or solo !  <3
19392,i did it i crashed a castle
19393,yes
19394,This was my first game to buy on Steam. I recommend this game because it is really fun to play with friends. There are humors and a great story. And the gameplay is also great with a challenging boss.
19395,"great game.specialy when u play co_op.i had one of the best experienses in my life with my friends at this game.its's a shame that i couldnt play more of this game,i did'nt had the time,i realy do recommend this game.just sit down and enjoy this game."
19396,Good
19397,love this game
19398,"Castle Crashers 
is a dream of game for me.

There is many things to explore you have a great story with some humor in it.
You got some characters you can level up them and get special skills for them.

I was a little bit sad (still sad ._.) after i finished the story mode it was hell of fun.

The game is a perfect game for you and friends (i hope you enjoy it)."
19399,"This game started my PC/Steam gaming Journey.
I remember playing this on my Uncles Xbox 360, and then I instantly wanted to buy it but I didnt have an Xbox. I bought it on my PC, it was amazing,"
19400,"Love this game! :)
It's fun to play with friends! :)"

19408,"Awesome game to play with a couple of your buddies. Leads to great laughs, rewarding boss-fights conquered through teamwork, and some interesting battles amongst each other when fighting for the affections of the princesses!"
19409,"So highly rated, but just not fun to me.  This seems just a bit too much of a mindless brawler.  Too much work for my hands, and my head just wants to go to sleep.  I love the unique style of games from this studio.  This just wasn't a winner for me.  Otherwise plays and runs fine on my Alienware Win10 GTX 1080 played full screen on my TV with a gamepad.

19414,I really like it its fun as fck and i really suggest pepole to buy it
19415,"This is the first review I have ever done for a game. I honestly can not express my hate and distaste for this game. It is a cheap, shallow flash game that will infuriate you until you jump out a window. There is no real progression to the game; enemies only are remasked meat bags to absorb hits and it is full of d-bag mechanics that will auto knockdown. I wish there was more to this game then that, but that is all it is. Hit boxes are terrible.  I was looking for a game to play with my girlfriend and was recommended this but boy, are there so many better suited games. The fact they they are still selling this aged 3rd rate Newgrounds flash game at such a price is just astounding."

19423,"Absolutely love the game. The game has such a fun, entertaining story line, and when you add friends, everything gets better. I played this game on console, and couldnt get enough of it. Therefore, I bought it on PC. Absolutely recommend this game to anyone thinking about purchasing the game. Very, very addictive game."

19425,"the volleyball stage is impossible , i tried 3 hours just to pass the volleyball stage.. game controls are terrible. in the beginning i loved the game but when i reach the volleyball stage i thought ""this is the worst game i ever played"".... dont waste your money on this shit."

'Tis a super easy hack and slash with some childish humor and fun animation :P

19437,"10/10
Castle crashers has an amazing amount of story and game mechanics, you meet new and interesting people along the way and try to stop the wizard from stealing the crystal, this game is hella worth it and can run on all and if not, most computers, anyway this game is very much worth it and as soon as you get the opportunity to buy it you should do so.

amazing story, wonderful characters and interesting game mechanics
10/10
best game"
19438,"Simply a great game from Behemoth. Adorable characters, phenomenal soundtrack, and the story-line is hilariously cute. It's a little short, but it's a game you could definitely get replayability out of."
19439,"Whilst this game is really old, and to be fair i am VEEEERY late to the party, it still really holds up, i've been playing with some friends through remote play lately and we've had a blast, even the gamemodes i didn't think would grab my attention like back off barbarian, ended up being lots of fun, but i do have one reccomendation, whilst this game is still tons of fun, if you're gonna play it i reccomend a buddy to play it with you, even better if you get 3 other people to fill the 4 person team.

Anyways, 10/10 still playing to this day."
19440,bruh
19441,Great with friends!
19442,I'd like to see more games like this. A sequel would be fantastic.

19454,yes.
19455,bruh this game is good af its entertaining and most fun you cna play with youyr friends love it its like an arcade kind of game but doesnt let you stock with grinding if you know ther mechanics really fun even better when you play as a team

19495,"Played it a ton on the 360 back in the day, came back to play it on PC a while back and all I can really say is it doesn't hold up really well. It's a fine game still, a good 7.5/10 and holds a special place in my heart, but I'd recommend waiting for it to go on sale before buying it."
19496,Awesome game! Brings back a sense of nostalgia to arcade days with your buds.

Graphics are great
Gameplay is beyond amazing 
Playing with a mouse and keyboard is comfortable though the developers recommend a controller (I prefer the keyboard and mouse me)
I’ve played this game since my old Xbox 360 days (2014)
If you choose the buy this game you won’t regret it yes it’s fun but the story gets repetitive so you can unlock new characters but it’s worth it if you like to grind and play online"
19510,"great game
"
19511,Party game.
19512,yeah no
19513,This game has all the memberries!  it still holds up and it is super fun.  Solo or with friends its just a good time.
19514,"It's alright from what I remember. Didn't get far enough to beat it with friends. Not motivated enough to finish it on my own.
I remember a lot of defecating animals in this one."
19515,This was my childhood on the PS3 but a very fun hack and slash game with grind  like gameplay variety of characters unlockable ones and variety of weapons. The game is pretty short but the grinding and insane mode makes up for it. There are 2 other modes arena for battling mostly fun with friends and back off barbarian which I rarely played basically because I miss volleyball from the original versions because they were more fun that back off barbarian but it still a enjoyable minigame. And the game is being released for PS4 and Switch. Cough cough hey uh The Behemoth we should get a sequel.
19516,"Love it. 

It´s still a funny playable game,after all that Time.The insane mode is literally insane haha watch out.Nice hack n´ slay and I still hope for a sequal c: Behemoth did a great work and they could add so many new features to the sequal gahhh 

idk what I could say..so uhm yeah buy it and uhm,if u´re a multimillionaire donate ure money to behemoth and tell them they should do a second castle crashers lol"

19518,One of my favorite games ever
19519,"I originally got this for the xbox 360 to play with my brother. I beat the game countless times and it never got boring. This is a solid 10/10 game and I love it. To make sure it wasn't just nostalgia, I got it on steam and was not disapointed."
19520,"The ultimate game to play with friends on the 360 back in the day. Even solo, the whole main story line is really fun to play. 

It's a classic for sure."
19521,"Hilarious, one of the best games I've ever played. Replay this all you want, it'll still be fun on the 4th save."
19522,This game was gifted to me by a friend and is a great gift to give people you can play with multiple controllers to so great for at home multiplayer with up to 4 people. :)
19523,chicken
19524,First played this game on the 360. Had to by the remastered version on Steam no regrets awesome game. Looking forward to future games by the same creators.
19525,"the game is good it has a weird but amazing story, the gameplay and mechanics are good, the graphics are amazing and runs pretty well on a potato like mine I'd strongly recommend this game"
19526,"     I had originally downloaded this game as a boy, a young lad looking to have some and maybe occupy a few hours of my time slaying monsters and such.  The only problem is that only 2 minutes into the story, I fell in love with who decided to refer to as, “the purple haired bitch”.  (Even saying her name now makes me want to discharge my beat stick) I was young and had the ambition, all I needed to do was find her and we could be together.  I wrote this haiku for her in a dream once, “Oh purple haired one, I want to motorboat you, please touch my penis.” 
     After spending 15ish hours playing this game with out doing as much as eating, sleeping, or using the bathroom, I finally got to face my love.  The only issue is when I leaned in for that toung tasting, I WAS BAMBOOZLED!!! When I emerged from my Castle Clashers hibernation, I was no longer a boy.  I emerged a man who now new what it meant to love and hate.
"
19527,fun game to hack and slash with friends
19528,Great MMO.
19529,Super fun to play with friends very addicting nice job!!!!
19530,Really reccomend! Great game for playing with friends!
19531,"Quirky and fun, easy to pickup but hard to put down"
19532,A fun.... game to play with friends.
19533,"At it's core, the game is most fun when played with friends in local multiplayer.  I would say it is a fantastic game for kids, siblings, and playing with your kids.

Its simple mechanics, however, means the experience can become very dull and uninteresting relatively quickly.

If I play for more than 20 minutes at a time I find myself on brain-dead auto-pilot just mashing the attack buttons and spamming strong magic attacks ad nauseum.  There is no risk/reward mechanics, there is no [i]real[/i] combo system, and the extremely simple tool-kits for each character means execution is simply not rewarding enough to merit long play sessions.

Each of the base 4 starter character technically has different magic abilities, though they are hardly very unique ([i]mostly[/i] just visual differences)... so they still all play essentially the same way.

[b]The most engaging part of this game is finding the vast quantity of weapons to collect and compare (each has different nerfs/buffs to your character's stats), along with unlocking some of the more interesting characters along the way.[/b]

I would recommend for the reasons I stated at the top, or if you are desperate for another local multiplayer game to try w/ friends, and if you enjoy the side-scrolling ""beat 'em up"" genre for what it is."
19534,"It's a good game, but not perfect. It's guaranteed to have great fun with your friends during the first couple of run-throughs. However for most people the game becomes stale after they've seen each level a few times.  Insane Mode (advanced difficulty) would probably only appeal to hardcore completionists like myself. It's a really cheap gameplay design of just raising the health and attack damage of every enemy. You could spend a half an hour on one insane mode level only to be 2 shotted by a couple enemies near the end, forcing you to start whole the level all over again (insane marsh, for example). Though it is just a simple beat em up  game that lives up to its name so I still have to recommend it for what it is."

10/10"
19543,Castle Crashers is great fun when it comes to local multiplayer. My kid has been coming back to this game every few months and has been since we first got it years ago on the xbox 360. The Behemoth made a real gem with this one.
19544,Good
19545,"This is an Old but Gold game. A nostalgic trip, while also being a challenging, but entertaining, multiplayer, co-op game.

It does, however, have a few problems:

One of them being farming. Farming isn't entirely needed, per say, but the game is much more difficult if you keep moving forward without a bit of exp grinding... and sandwiches.

Second problem is that majority of the difficulty comes from a horde of enemies on the screen. This includes two particular bosses that aren't much without the horde of baddies at their side.

Besides those two problems, the game is amazing. The design is stylistic, similarly to ol' fashioned Newgrounds. The music used is awesome, and the combat works as does the variety of spells and abilities.

This is definitely a game best played with friends, as the game is more entertaining with others by your side, and there is no better feeling than working together to get through the thick of things... then being able to beat the crap out of your teammates by the end of the battle."
19546,Awesome game I strongly recommend it. But its best enjoyed with friends.
19547,a fun multiplayer game!

19554,is nice

19557,"This game cured my depression.
Also I beat my girlfriend in getting pussi from a princess.

Rekt babe. If u ever read this >:)"
19558,"Overall, this game is a really silly and fun beat-em-up that truly is meant for extra players (the more the merrier in this case). I'd recommend it, but it's a much better experience with friends. Maybe convince your friend to buy it on a sale, or even gift it to them (It gets very cheap on sales). It'll be worth the adventures you'll have, for the most part.

8/10"
19559,"A fun game at its core. Can't believe it has taken me this long to review it.
So i've beaten this game a few times on normal, none on ""INSANE MODE""
Got a few characters up in level and I like all the differences in character abilities. (mostly counting the original cast)
Unlocking extras seems to be fairly easy (done in 1p). I do recommend this also with a party, preferably a full party of 4.
I mean that's less player gold and experience but the fun factor is also well worth it. So take that into account especially since in 1p health pots must be taken manually unlike in multiplayer where they're used automatically upon ""death""
Normal mode play will probably take you upwards of 5 to 6 hours solo (or maybe i'm just bad). Maybe a little longer if you're into grinding a bit more to make the trip ahead easier.
A solid recommend. I mean I've had almost 9 hours in the past week from grinding as I've recently came back to the game, though that's just my fun experience. Hopefully you'll have as much fun as I do / did."
19560,"real fun to play, and allows up to 4 players to play multiplayer with! advance your magic, to throw powerful magic abilities at your enemies, make your defense stronger and be a tank to suck up the damage! increase your agility to be the fastest around, or make your strength stronger and hit the hardest! totally recommend this game, not enough games like this in my opinion get it buy it, play it!"
19561,"10 out of 10 on this game.  It is a blast to play with friends, creative, and just flat out fun!  Worth the money, especially if you have friends to play with.  You can do co-op local and multiplayer, was able to play with my friend from Venezuela!

19562,"very fun game, you dont need friends, but its also fun with friends :)"
19563,"This game has gone way back and through most my childhood, such an amazing game for such a low price! The 15 dollars can provide hour and HOURS of nonstop fun due to how many characters there are. Even though beating the same level over and over again will feel different with each character and no matter how many hours you spend on this IDLE game you'll always enjoy every second of it!"
19564,"Not my cup of tea, but i absolutely loved the art."
19565,this game is absolutely flawless the animations music it rewards playing with friends and you can have so much fun! thank you for making my childhood better this is the best game ive ever played!
19566,"Classic beat 'em up action, polished and easy to play alone or with friends. A bit grindy after lvl 20, but there is a surprising amount of content to keep the pace. 
I bought this for my five year old son to play with me, now he thinks everything is a sword and tries to beat the crap out of his sister...Don't buy this for your children, mostly you'll end up carrying the game, because you're always ten lvls higher than them. Then you'll have to switch characters with your kid so they can actually help, and they'll decide to ""hide in a bush.""
 Even when they do try to help, they can't get in line with the enemy and end up swinging too high, too low, or turn around a whiff the space where no one is standing. Just put points into defense, again, because they won't hit anything, and really just need to stay alive to enjoy success by association.
Eventually this will backfire as they realize they can't beat the game without your help. So take that lvl 15 character and with your kid at lvl 60, you'll somehow manage to out dps them, only to have a duel for the final princess' kiss and get knocked out in 3 shots. 
Let them enjoy the victory, because you know who the real hero is.
It's you."
19567,"A near-perfect cooperative beat-em-up (probably one of the the best since 16-bit TMNT games) with just the right difficulty curve.

Simple and accessible at first, it grows surprisingly deeper and harder over time, with more and more of game mechanics coming into play. Lots of combos and magic to master, pets and weapons to unlock and choose from, hilarious boss fights, great soundtrack, smooth controls, and everything else you'd expect from a beat-em-up.

Local coop is the best way to enjoy the game, providing tons of fun and giving opportunities for strategic approach to boss fights and those tougher levels. It doesn't require extreme dedication though, so your not-so-hardcore friends can play casually (mash buttons) while you tank it out with style (be ready to CPR them when needed). Also, grab some drinks, snacks and enough controllers for maximum awesome.

P.S. I'm a more-or-less hardcore gamer from the 8-bit era, my friend is a casual gamer, we have completed the main game cooperatively over a few sessions and we both had loads and loads of fun in the process.

P.P.S. The game supports both XInput and DInput, so if you still have some older controllers lying around, you can put them to use too (for 4-player coop which is total mayhem btw)."
19568,Hilarious fun!
19569,Good multiplayer game with unlockable characters. :D
19570,yeah
19571,This Game I Had during a Free Week Was Amazing me and my friend played alot together just to reach the ending This hack&Slash is So good That it's Coming to switch! For my Bday me and my dad are gonna get pokken Castle crashers and much more this game was amazing!
19572,"A fun, side scrolling action game."
19573,you know shits fucked up when its only stage 2 and already you face weeb sushi bears with katanas
19574,"love the game so much, got it for me and 2 friends i only with the soundtrack was part of the dlc list"
19575,This game is my childhood!!
19576,This game makes my male genitals become erect out of pure happ-penis
19577,"A funny game with good graphics, every gamer needs to play this game in his life even that the year is 2019."
19578,"castle crashers is a great 4 player action side-scrolling beat em up with you and three groups of friends fight many intresting enemy's to save princesses and have fun while doing it,i would definitly recommend this game"
19579,"Dude, your a crusader with powers, what else would you want?"
19580,"This game came out in 2008. It still is more fun, not pay to win and extremely better then most games that are out in 2019. Not only is the play time unlimited because you can do many different play styles and skill upgrades, but the game is also $15.00. That is a deal if I have ever made one. Do yourself a favor a grab the 15 dollars I know you have lying around and buy this game to have an amazing time with friends or if you don't have any then you will still have fun. Keep making good games."
19581,Really fucking cute.
19582,"Castle Crashers really is an amazing game; while its core principle is really simple, it's tons of fun to run around and smash your opponents brainlessly! And in addition to that, there are stats to manage if you wanna play with your sword, your bow, or even use magic! It gives the game some replayability, in addition to all the good stuff that's already in it. However I recommend playing with friends as coop is much more hilarious than solo mode. Whatever you play by yourself or not, hitting through waves of enemies never felt so good!

Completionists out there: When it comes to achievements, you'll get half of these naturally, some others will be easy to get with a little bit of time/training; but a few of them require people to play with/against, and if you don't have any friend to help you they can be a problem. Outside of achievements, completing everything will be a pain if you play by yourself, as the NG+ mode is absolutely brutal. If you get expert friends to team up, you should be fine; expert friends are hard to find that is.

Oh and Back off Barbarian can be kinda fun, but it's nothing exceptionnal. The grinding that leads to the achievement related to that mini-game will drive you crazy if you're not lucky enough to get it on your first few attempts, too."
19583,Classic and amazing beat em up!
19584,I recommend this game if you have atleast 2-4 friends to enjoy every hour of the game. Even after you finish it
19585,fuck off marcus i dont want to play castle crashers
19586,e
19587,Best beat em up of all time.
19588,"This game should be right up my alley, but it's just barely too slow and repetitive for my tastes. Castle Crashers could use some adjustments in pacing and overall combat design, or maybe I should just find some damn friends willing to hunker down and go hard in this. I shouldn't have bought this game, but you probably won't be so picky."
19589,"I've played this game with a couple of friends, and it is absolutely hilarious, adventurous and amazing. You can dedicate a lot of hours into this game and lose track of time. This game is definitely good for all ages and it is honestly one of the best games I have ever played (side scroller wise)."
19590,"Castle Crashers is a right laugh when playing it with friends as you go through different levels to fight bosses it is a action adventure type of game and is really fun to play it is worth buying i would give this game a 8/10.


"
19591,Game is good for nostalgic... Then gets boring af
19592,"yes
edit: I.. also did this when i was 9.."
19593,Da greatest game eva made
19594,nice
19595,"Best game. 10/10, buy immediately if you have the money. Great to play with a friend or a few more people!! Super fun :DD"
19596,"Really good game, worth playing and completing but is a lot better with friends! I completed this game on Xbox years ago and to play it on PC with different people is great, although there is not much to do after completing the game apart from levelling up a different character or Figuring out the easter eggs it's still worth a play."
19597,"This is the best game I've ever played, it takes me back so many years. I've had it on all the available platforms, but some of them were at my friend' place. This game is super fun with other people, so if you want to play this or buy this, I recommend you grab some pals to play this game.

This game deserves the attention it gets and should probably get a sequel by now.
But I don't mind, keep it alive folks!"
19598,"Fun hack and slash indie game to play with friends or by yourself. A lot of silly humor that plays out through the whole story, which is just fantastic. One of my favorite indie games. 


DAMN THAT VOLLEYBALL LEVEL!!!!!"
19599,"The most simplistic of games ever, I mean whats so complicated about running in a staight line beating up enemies over and over, but this side-scrolling beat-em-up game is FANTASTIC when combined with the amazing artwork, the amazing soundtrack for every level, and the non-stop action packed awesomeness, and the game only gets better when banded together with your friends for the best time of your life. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO EVERYONE!!!!!"
19600,"very nice
"
19601,GAME FOR RAGES
19602,wonderful game  love it from game play and friends amazing honestly i just LOVE THIS GAME
19603,"It's really fun and addicting. I love the random silliness and I love the combat style so much, but the game is really hard to play alone in some parts :( None of my friends own a copy."
19604,Its fun.
19605,very good game
19606,"Great game! I would personally wait till it goes on sale, but still a game I randomly play and enjoy."
19607,I like how this game is so replay-able but believe there could be changes to how the 4 stats work.
19608,+2 Local Co-op
19609,Great Co-op game/squad game. Lots of fun playing this game. Even after 300ish hours I have yet to unlock everything. Great game
19610,I LOVED IT!!
19611,"fun game even if you go solo, but better with friends, especially for couch co-op gaming"
19612,very ideal to play with a group of friends
19613,Got it but I have no friends :(
19614,"Nobody wanna play with me. 
;("
19615,"It's just a repetitive, shallow beat 'em up. It's a smooth implementation of that premise, with couch co-op which is always good to see. Still just not very interesting though, and certainly not worth the glowing average it currently has"
19616,"muito bom jogo, gráficos suaves, gameplay maravilhosa, e roda muito suavimente"
19617,its a good game 10/10
19618,"God, this is such a classic. Played this with my father and brother for hours on the xbox arcade! It is a pretty enjoyable experience through all the way, with good humor and smashing combat, using a few combos that you start out with and start earning more as you level up, allowing for a good learning curve. Plenty of variety in the levels, from fighting barbarians in a large, bloody war to playing volleyball in a castle completely made out of sand. There is never a dull moment in this, and with the few characters you start with having different magic attacks, each is somewhat different. As you play and even beat the game, you get more characters depending on what you beat the game with. Add that to how you can add points into different stats of your choosing, the large variety of weapons with different stats, a hard mode, secrets to discover, and even mini-games like arena mode, and you got yourself one game that you can replay like crazy! 

The only thing that I personally dislike is the fact that they removed the original ""All you can Quaff"" in favor of a new game called ""Back Off Barbarian"". This is just me being difficult to change most likely, but I don't see why they needed to remove the gamemode for this one to take its place. ""All you can Quaff"" was just one glorified button masher, requiring you to rapidly tap a few buttons to eat as fast as you can. ""Back Off Barbarian"" is a minigame where you have these game pieces that you have to press around the board, but each tile changes in what button leads to it while also changing color, clearly trying to throw you off as you stumble away from the encroaching barbarians. Nothing against this mode, but I do wish the button mashing goodness could have existed alongside this, if only just to ruin the few 360 controllers that still function."
19619,"Very recommended for single-player|multiplayer a lot of characters to play and funny animation!!!  worth the money 

(tip: in G2A it costs 3USD)"
19620,"Do not get me wrong. This game is fantastic and deserves a spot in history.

Except... even with friends, Castle Crashers tends to get boring quite fast. It's good for one run through the story, browsing the mini-games and then... that's it. It couldn't keep my attention for long, after that."
19621,poop jokes good game
19622,"Very nice and relaxing game, a lot of fun playing with friends. Completed it once with the ice guy solo, tough challenge but not too hard on the mind as with other games. 8/10"
19623,yes very cool
19624," Intro: Castle Crashers is a simple and fun beat em up game with colorful graphics, good controls all around, decent soundtrack, and is a game that is meant to be played with some buddies of yours like games such as Left 4 Dead 1/2, Garry's Mod, and Magicka 1/2.

What is it: This is a beat em up game that features some magical mechanics making each knight different. You start off with the original red, orange, green, and blue knight. As you progress through the story to save all the princesses, retrieve the king's crystal., and stopping the evil wizard guy, you will gain new knights and abilities on your journey.

Pros: The game has pretty good graphics for something that came out in 2012 in my opinion. Locations and the creatures within them are very diverse and makes you feel like you're on a wacky quest. Speaking of which, the story has some good laughs without even having characters say any lines. Controls for both keyboard and controllers are both solid,l however if you have either an XBOX controller or PS4 controller emulator like me, go for that if you want to make sure your hands don't cramp while playing in the campaign.

Cons: Although the game is fun with friends, it's not the best to traverse alone. The game can become a bit to boring and even too difficult (Although that's why you try and get good if you're in these situations, but even then it can be too hard on your own). 

Just so you know: This game can be played be binge played for long periods of time, however, I believe that playing through sessions with friends after certain parts of the story like taking out certain dungeons, saving a princess, etc. Doing this makes you, in my opinion, make the game feel more interesting and make you ready to come back for more.

Conclusion: If you like rpgs, beat em ups, poop humor, and/or need a break from competitive games (Overwatch, League of Legends, SMITE) and what not get this game. With the fair price of usually being 15 dollars and having $2 - $4  worth of knight dlc, this game is worth the price. Plus, if you played and liked other ""The Behemoth"" games, then you owe it to yourself to play this game if you haven't already.

Buy or Skip?: Buy this game whether if it's full price or on sale"
19625,One of the best beat um up games ever made. 9/10 would crash castles again.
19626,Great game to kill time (and barbarians) and have fun with friends.
19627,"10/10 would ride projectile pooping deer again

for real though this is classic buy this, grab some friends, and smash"
19628,Such a fun game. Like Alien Hominid with an extra dimension. Owait..
19629,This game is just like really really good
19630,its ok

19639,i got the demo of this game it was so fun now i have the whole game
19640,"gameplay is entertaining, play time is virtually infinite as you can reset any charecters info and stats at will, but idk if there is a reward for going through and beating the entire game on insane mode. shouldnt there be an achievement for the massive amount of dedication?"
19641,"Very funny,but you may need some friends to get more fun."
19642,"The only beat em' up I've ever beaten more than once. It's a great time all around, and the advanced combos are really fun and satisfying to pull off. More characters will be unlocked after each playthrough, so the incentive to sink tons of time into it is really strong. Classic indie gaming at it's finest."
19643,"I almost finished this game once. lol
Still got ways to go.
But I enjoy it mainly with friends so depending on how offten I get to play with my friends will determine when I beat this game. I recommend this only if you got friends to play with otherwise it gets repetitive."
19644,just buy this game already and play it with your friends!
19645,This is super fun to play with friends and it's a great time waster without internet.
19646,"Funny game! Nice multi player share screen! Ideal to beat some time, e.g. curing a hangover! :)"
19647,"Really great and fun game to play with your buddies!
Any age category can enjoy this Hack&Slash game with little knights!
Worth it's price!

(I strongly recommend a controller to play...)"
19648,Play this game with friends if you have them.
19649,Very fun
19650,"Oodles of fun, I've played it to death on My xbox360 when I was a kid."
19651,"When are they going to add necromancer and king pack dlc to castle crashers on pc?

"
19652,"I shouldn't even have to recommend this game. It should just know I would like it and do it for me.

This game was something I bought multiple times and beat the crap out of... again, multiple times.
I got it for Xbox 360 and got the DLC then too. Played the crap out of it with Couch Co-op and enjoyed every moment of the game. From the Big Cat Boss fight to the Hulked up Beat downs. The game may be old now but it will always be a favourite co-op game of mine.

If you HAVEN'T played it and need a good Beat 'em up then don't waste anymore time with other reviews, buy the game and enjoy it yourself."
19653,Great game
19654,"Great game to vent out anger and also really fun to play with friends. Stays interesting and challenging and unlocking all the characters is fun! Can be difficult but not frustrating, great game."
19655,"A cool beat em up game that's a ton of fun with super good replayability. Fun with friends or even by yourself. Everything about this game is pretty good. Overall, I would reccomend this game to literally anyone who likes games."
19656,It´s good and fun.Try it.
19657,"An arcade classic, castle crashers is a definite buy for those looking for a wacky side scrolling rpg geared heavily towards cooperative play.

8.5/10"
19658,One of the best indie games.
19659,Its barely fun only if you have friends.
19660,"Yep, get some friend to play with you"

One of the most enjoyable multiplayers of my younger years that aged beautifully."
19672,GOOD
19673,what
19674,"WOW DE GAME GOOD
"
19675,"This is a lot of fun, best as a co-op, or better with all four. Can easily drop in and out when looking to play something enjoyable and light-hearted between your Darksouls, GTAs, Bloodbournes, and similar. 

Simple modern arcade style, fast paced action, fun story and animations, great level atmosphere and lots of characters to play as, some with special abilities. 
"
19676,"It's made by The Behemoth, what do u expect?
These guys make good games, but they don't give love to Dad 'n' Me tho.
10/10, good gameplay, graphics, co-op, optimization, blah, blah, blah. Just buy it.
"
19677,"The game brings us the classic Beat 'em up theme set in a medieval context, but Castle Crashers is far, far from being nostalgic or limiting itself to being a tribute, this is a unique game, you may not like it or you may love it, but recognition is immediate. Its design is distinct, the non-sense comic atmosphere is great, the gameplay is fluid and the story, despite being used of the plot of the warrior rescuing the princess, stands out when differentiating itself by the use this non-sense humor. The mechanics of level, weapons and pet are very cool and give different options of dynamics and strategy. Perhaps what I enjoy most about this game are the characters, from the main warriors who are unique and unmistakable, to the bosses who are very different from each other, to pets and enemies (including the iconic yellow alien from Alien Hominid). The game encourages you to play more and more, either when you are winning and moving to other levels, either when you lose or even when you finish the game, giving you several arena options. A very fun game that is worth to play alone, in double or in a group."
19678,"Childhood game
Still fun after all these years
Definitely recommended."
19679,"Very nice game to play with friends.
Have a lot of fun with that arcade game, really nice soundtrack and mechanics.
Very recomended!"
19680,"Fun, goofy co-op games from Newgrounds. Nice time with friends."
19681,This game is a 10/10
19682,"A great game. One of the very first I ever bought on this account due to good memories playing couch coop with buddies.
I highly recommend grabbing it. It's simple, yet not repetitive, and offers enough rpg and loothunting elements to make you want to progress your character, without making the gameplay solely dependent on specific loot or attribute specialization. 

Just have fun fighting off generic grunts, eating steroid sandwiches, throwing boomerang skillshots, and playing the occasional minigame. 

It's worth it at full price, and a must-have at sale price. Try it out!"

19697,Bomb ass game 20/10
19698,A W E S O M E !
19699,Castle Crashers is a great funny game as all behemoth games are. Great game to play with up to 4 friends. It is pure chaos through. I have laughed my ass off several time in this game. The game runs well and the controls well. 10/10
19700,"Good shit. 
This is some good shit, if I do say so. 
And I say so. Oh, yes, I do. 
-
Oh, look, the multiplayer has a bit of delay. 
Ahh, this is the good shit. The lag's just great, it's not like it's gotten me killed three times in only five minutes! 
It's not the game's fault if the delay in an online game kills you, it's yours!  - Yeah, no. 

Singleplayer's fun, even if you're not getting the full experience that it's suppose to offer in a multiplayer game. Can require more than a single brain-cell to play.
The game's multiplayer is a mess, though, unless you're co-oping with friends in a local game. Online games have a huge amount of lag. As in, bigger than Harambe's flaccid dong. Overall, good game, but the multiplayer needs to be polished for it to be much better.
"
19701,very lit game. It's really fun to play with friends and family. I've played this game for about 4 years on the Xbox and now I have it here. It's a really good game in my opinion.
19702,Worth!
19703,"You all should play this amazing and fun game i prefer to play it with a friend or more cause its funnier u know the more the funnier. Go ahead and by this amazing game!

i just got back into playing this game, and i still love it"
19704,"Just such a fun game, especially with friends; offline and online; I recomend this for people who want to play games with their friends, or just want a very VERY challenging single player game to play by themselves."
19705," 2 extra characters with every knight + dlc + insane mode +basic rpg elements +amazing co-op couch or online + funny humor = amazing game

First released in 2008, it took this game 4 years to arrive on the PC. But it was worth the wait! 

Your quest in this side-scrolling beat' em up is to hunt down an evil sorcerer who rode away on the castle's magic crystal, kidnapped four princesses, and left your kingdom in ruin. The game is a hilarious adventure through medieval countrysides, enemy-filled castles, and venting volcanoes in search of true love. The best part of Castle Crashers is exploring the world - there are tons of levels that look and play completely differently. Between the characters, weapons, and the story there is more than enough content and comedic action for everyone with a weird sense of humor.

Hack your way through mounds of enemies, gain experience points and level up. As you progress, you'll accumulate skill points to divide amongst four traits: Strength, Magic, Defense, and Agility. You can build up your character however you like. There are a few combos to be unlocked and different weapons have slight differences in stats, but Crashers rarely gets more complicated than 'whack baddies in face till dead'... except for the bosses.

Bosses are not only grand in scale but also a fun challenge. There is a pattern to their attacks, and it requires strategy in addition to a flurry of attacks to bring them down.

Game supports local or online mode for up to 4 players.

[u][b] Conclusion:[/b][/u]
Even today still one of the best 4-player side-scrolling beat'em ups around on Steam!"
19732,another nice game for your boredom
19733,this game very many good fun. especially when you have friends (i dont)
19734,"I don't think I understand the game, i got a 4-pack with my friends and we all found it intensely boring, the game seems designed for little kids."
19735,u wanna kiss the princess???then kill each other before u can kiss her...
19736,this game is fun i like it
19737,"Behemoth can do no wrong. This 2008 masterpiece has always been one of my favorite games. Every level is fun even after the 200th time playing through. The normal campaign is great, but the real fun begins when you encounter the extremely challenging Insane Mode. It's great playing by yourself but combine your friends with this game and you have a never ending blood bath of fun! the game is 11 years old and it still holds up and always will. 10/10 no doubt about it."
19738,"single greatest side scroller ever made, fuck you dad i dont wanna do my chores i will hack your head off"
19739,"Fun with friends, boring solo imo 6/10"
19740,"bro, this a good game.. ngl"
19741,"""This game was really fun to play with my friend for the time I had it during the spring cleaning event. Overall great game to play with friends."""
19742,I 1000% recommend this game.
19743,Good Game
19744,Old School best game.
19745,"Castle Crashers is hands down one of the best games i ever played, certainly the best beatemup i ever played and in my eyes the best Behemoth game. It has great and iconic artstyle really good music and a simple but funny and entertaining story. The replayability is really high, just because there are many characters to unlock and almost every character when you beat the game with him unlock a new character. Which differ mainly in appearence and their magic, and the magic is a pretty great deal i mean with the bear character you can turn into a tornado, or you can learn how to mash the buttons just right that it makes you fly utilizing this with the gray knight can turn you into a goddamn bomber! The posibilities just seem infinite! I cant say that this review wasnt at all blinded by nostalgia but i just cant get enough of this game! And hey there is a demo version so you dont even have to buy it to try if it is for you. I know its for me and i dont even play beatemup aside from this, i usually play FPS games or RPGs but this game ❤ ❤ ❤ !"
19746,"The game is very good is has a great story, beautiful character design and multiple weapons and characters too chose."
19747,it fun tiem but no ezy
19748,dis gam gud
19749,Part of my soul was taken away when I played this
19750,"I've got a soft spot for 2D beat-em-up platformy type games, growing up with Kirby and all.
I uh... still... need to beat this one. Heh heh. The fact remains I was enthralled and enjoyed everything this game threw at me."
19751,"Bad control import from the xbox 360, but alas a good game... But the controls are so terrible that it actually makes it somewhat unplayable."
19752,10\10 I love becoming cat food
19753,"Finally finnished the game with a friend of mine, the whole process took around 3 weeks, this is a fun game, there are so many types of weapons, characters, I like how the boss's ability will be applied to even their own minoions, anyhow, you should try this out"
19754,"Its good but its a friends only kinda game. You can try and find a online match but with the lack of a server browser and drop in drop out, good luck finding a PUB."
19755,good game but im waiting the 2 please make 2 or you will basicli you will be the valve if half life 3 DONT EXIST but its a good game
19756,Great Game To Play With Friends. If You Play It Alone Its Still Pretty Fun But Not As Fun As It Can Be.
19757,This game is worth every cent you pay for it! The DLC's are worth the $0.99 you pay for them! This is one of those games you can spend alot of time on- and it'll still be fun!
19758,nice mice dice like ice
19759,Good game
19760,*Friends required for an actual good game
19761,"I've been looking for something casual, fun, and even a little bit silly, for a while. I don't remember exactly what it was, but I was reminded of this game, so I thought I'd see if it was on Steam, which wasn't something I had much hope for. But it's right here. And it's every bit as stupid, fun, and charming, as I remember it being. 

The only thing I really took issue with were the keyboard controls. They are horrific. If you play the game, use a controller. It'll make your life so much easier and your fingers will probably thank you."
19762,WARNING DON'T PLAY WITHOUT A CONTROLLER. also play with a friend.
19763,Always fun (except desert levels on insane mode)   9/9
19764,make sequel
19765,Is a great game. Very fun. I don't use a controler and is still managable. I do recommend getting the badge from the foil cards for this game.
19766,"Even with a remastered Steam release, Castle Crashers still manages to feel like an old Newgrounds Flash game, updated for the modern age. With its vivid hand-drawn graphics and crude humor, as well as simple gameplay that lasts for hours Castle Crashers calls back to us all when we were kids, playing co-op on the same keyboard with a best friend. Now with all the polish a Steam release gives, Castle Crashers makes a name for itself as a co-op arcade party game that still is reminiscent of its origins.

What little story Castle Crashers has is in the details, and it's nothing you absolutely have to pay attention to in order to progress. Play as one of the starting knights and rescue four princesses from boss monsters in different areas, collecting weapons, defeating mini-bosses and buying items along the way. There's no spoken words or dialog to follow, making it a good game to play with children as well. The entire game runs about two hours, but leveling up characters and unlocking all the extras makes for a much longer experience full of replay potential.

Gameplay in Castle Crashers is super simple, unless you want to get into min/maxing and combo heavy combat. There's a few combos given to you, mostly for magic usage, upon leveling up your character. Magic is where most of the variety in characters comes in, as all of them have seemingly the same melee attacks and combos. Weapons don't do anything special aside from stats other than adding a secondary effect on a select few. Pets as well are super simple, adding one small passive effect and being with you until you pick up another one. Without using magic, combat is almost repetitive especially out of a party where you're only focusing on yourself and your own move set. The most efficient way through the game is spamming whatever sort of combat (magic/melee) you have leveled up most and hoping for the best, which can break the experience for a lot of people.

There is the option to play solo, and while it realistically is possible to do, some of the areas are clearly meant for a party of players. The one that stands out most is a volleyball-arena type boss fight toward the end of the game where you're against four enemies who can easily score on one player alone. I played solo and this is where I struggled most with the game, having to go back and change what weapon/pet I was using so I could move faster. It would be much easier on players who don't have capability to play with others to make ""easier"" modes depending on number of players, where bosses toned down their tactics in favor of a solo player. It's fully possible to beat the entire game going solo, however. Other than a few points in boss fights I never struggled playing alone.

Playing solo involves a lot of repetitive combat and struggles to get gold due to buying items for survivability. A lot of my time was spent running back to get more potions from shops just to keep myself from losing all my progress. Because it was one player against a horde of enemies, stacking defense stats didn't do much to help me progress. Areas took longer than they would have with a party, and sometimes running and kiting was all I could do. The combat felt clunky because all the enemies are only targeting one player and have plenty of knockbacks to ruin combos you're running. As a solo player though, you do of course get to keep all your loot which could be a plus side to those who have greedy friends.

Overall Castle Crashers was meant to be played as a group, or at least with a partner. Some of the achievements are locked behind playing with other players as well, specifically a four player group in some cases. Once again, it would have been nice to have alternatives for those of us who don't have friends with the game or friends interested in playing Castle Crashers, but I can understand the devs wanting Castle Crashers to be enjoyed as a group, it feels like a much better game that way. Playing with other players makes the combat feel a lot better and moves the game along quicker, allowing for a strategic element of everyone in the party filling a role on the team.

I recommend Castle Crashers, but only if you have the patience to play it solo or have a group to play co-op with. It's a very great game, especially viewed as an arcade or party title. It's got charms and plenty of replay potential for completionists, with so many characters, weapons and pets to unlock or discover. The developer, The Behemoth, has some other really solid arcade and party titles that are worth checking out if this kind of game is interesting to you."
19767,I love the game
19768,Honestly Based.
19769,"great game would love it on the switch though. i think it would do well on it
"

19773,"the game is good but the final boss is shit
it has 6 forms and all are hard it is shit
but the game is good"
19774,"Finished it with my SO, lots of fun, 2.5D could have been made better though, as it wasn't always obvious whether you could hit/get hit by an enemy."
19775,Its ok but its too hard because theres so many enemis and its impossible but ok or i hate it
19776,"This is a great game, wish i could play it more often. Got it is a bundle with batle block  bad it was worth every penny. Simple but amazing visuals, lots of charecters to unlock. A well rounded game from  The Behemoth."
19777,Very fun game especially with friends and you can put countless hours into it grinding for all the weapons and pets. Really appreciate the cheap DLC aswell
19778,great if you have friends. grindy if you don't.
19779,boring
19780,Stunning.
19781,A masterpiece of a game but sometimes you need to grind too much if you have no friends to play with.
19782,Its a pretty good game
19783,fun to play with family and friends!
19784,"My childhood, and still my favourite co-op beat'em'up game."
19785,"I have not been able to stop playing this game. It is so addicting! I love all the animation for it, and the game itself is so fun! I love how it all ties together from different levels! I absolutely would recommend this game and I need to find more games like this..."

19791,I really like this game. Me and my friend want to replay this game a lot of times to unlock lvl 99 to nearly every character. exept the DLC ones. Not really into buying DLC's. The funny thing while i was playing i unlocked nearly all the characters mistakely.

19806,"Great if you like watching Pooping Forest Owls of Justice and riding deers into battle with your friends while listening to music so fantastic that your ears will bleed to rescue four questionable princesses with your fish swords from a crystal riding dark mage, a necromancer and one painter boi.

Not great if you suck.

19807,It's great. Every once in a while you get bored of it. Then you come back.
19808,"Honestly the best game i have ever played with friends . Recommend 100%
Its funny, the storyline is good and you cant get bored of it. Really not much to say, 10 out of 10"
19809,I had fun playing it with my friends but then they just didn't want to finish it with me...
19810,best game ever and great to play with your friends if you have any
19811,"One of the best games I've played with fun, replayable action and endless laughs if played with friends. If you're for a game to quickly just grind out with friends then this is it. I recommend playing with a controller because the controls on the keyboard to me were very bad. If you want to expierence the game to the fullest you should probably play with friends unless you're just that much of a gamer. I have nothing but love for this game and would also recomend any of Behomth's games."
19812,Attack on kings landing 1999 b.c. colorized.
19813,"This game is so silly, obnoxiously loud, and in-your-face, that you can't help but like it. Or hate it so much that you like it.

If you're a fan of arcadey beat 'em ups, and zany humour, I'm going to suggest this is a good purchase. The soundtrack is catchy as heck, and it's hilariously fun in multiplayer. There's even a fair bit to do and unlock that it will keep you busy far longer than games like this normally would, though it's so old now that you simply must insist on a discounted price.

"
19814,games trash
19815,l really love newgrounds ，when i was a child，l played purple one beat  little gays everyday
19816,"amazing game and its been out for 10 years and its still popular
"
19817,Nostalgia
19818,Best hack and slash on steam.
19819,"when i first got the game i was like ""meh just some other indie game i played in 2012"",Now im like ""HOLY S*** THIS GAME IS AWESOME!"" 9/10 best game i have every played, only thing i don't like is the volly ball match."
19820,"Castle Crashers is my favourite game of all time, and for a reason.
Castle Crashers is a side-scrolling beat-em-up adventure time, featuring over 30 characters, over 50 weapons, over 20 pets and replay material.
While most of the knights are the same just like the enemies, there is still a small difference that makes each of them shine.
The two best parts about this game are
1. Bosses: The bosses are all unique and very fun, my personal picks are the Painter, Frost King and Pipistrello.
2. Co-Op: Just like most Behemoth games, Co-Op is the way to go! Fight the enemies with friends or battle your own friends!
There are total of 3 different modes, over 10 achievements to get, and Newgrounds humour shoved in here and there.
I highly recommend this game if you just want to have fun, while it has a spot in my heart, I have to be hoenst and give it a 7/10 due to it being able to get pretty boring at times."
19821,This game is really great. I have played it for 100 hours
19822,"Great game to waste time. Play it with friends, or solo, both options are equally challenging and fun. Don't waste your time and read this review, buy the game. BUY IT! BUY IT RIGHT F***ING NOW! IT'S FUN! Good luck :D"
19823,"This is by far one of my favorite games from childhood. It's great for anyone who wants those childhood nostalgic feels back. It's worth the price when it's on sale. The controls are just a little bit uncomfortable, but it's not that hard to ease into them. If you've never played it before it's a great party game, or a casual game to play with friends. $15 seems a little pricey though.
Cute vibrant 2D artstyle. It kept me and my friends entertained for awhile. 
"
19824,good game
19825,"Dang, I remember playing this game one the Xbox360, I like it. I can replay every level and legit never beat the game, but that's how mafia works. If you wanna get zucced into 2010 again, buy this game."
19826,Fun for all ages and genders
19827,"I’ve been wondering why it is that I find Edmund McMillen’s [i]The Binding of Isaac[/i] to be an obscenely ugly game, but quite enjoy the visual style of the similarly-drawn style of The Behemoth’s [i]Castle Crashers[/i]. What I’ve come down to is that whilst both have the schoolbook look of a teenager’s first Adobe Flash project, Behemoth artist Dan Paladin’s have some actual colour to them, both in terms of visuals and personality. [i]Castle Crashers[/i] is a dialogue-free affair, one in which moment-to-moment gameplay and setpieces take precedence over any semblance of an overarching plot.

[i]Castle Crashers[/i] is a series of gags, basically, and those gags include the actual gameplay - a standard co-op beat ‘em up starring a group of colour-coded, magic-endowed knights on a quest to rescue a variety of princesses. At the end of each side-scrolling stage, the players fight one another to the death to earn a kiss from the princess they’ve just rescued. After each stage players upgrade various statistics for the following stage. Weapons and familiars can be found and swapped out, but all of this is so much oregano on the meaty hunk that is the core gameplay; a violent, messy brawl against increasingly difficult enemies and bosses. One of my favourite little treats that [i]Castle Crashers[/i] offers is the occasional diversions into increasingly weird territory, like the segment in which a colossal, eldritch entity chases the players through a lumber mill while they ride deer, followed by a segment in which players have to fight the entity in a river by standing on assorted objects like logs or sharks. The game is quite happy to just lurch players into a totally bizarre and unfamiliar scenario, only to shift focus abruptly to another, weirder scenario.

The way [i]Castle Crashers[/i] keeps shaking things up is definitely the highlight of the experience. The wacky, cartoony antics that drive the action are what keeps a pulse going in a game that’s otherwise a very standard arcade beat ‘em up that would be far too repetitive to sustain itself on the basis of its core gameplay alone. Lucky for [i]Castle Crashers[/i], bizarreness is the spice of life, and no level of repetition could outclass the bizarreness that serves as an undercurrent for the entire game."
19828,"Love this game so much! Has the exact feel of all the old arcade side-scrollers I loved as a kid (think Simpsons, Turtles, X-men, etc.), complete with the ability to go 4-player co-op. Although the game can be beaten relatively quickly, I've found that taking the different heroes through the campaign or taking your best hero into insane mode offer some definite replayability."
19829,"I'M PINK!! Look at my sword!! Swoosh, swoosh, swing! Perfect couch party game."
19830,good game

19840,"idk really know what to say that hasn't already been said. umm, this game's quite addicting and fun to play with friends. if you have friends and controllers, this is a must play. there. review done."
19841,it made me overcome depression :)))
19842,what it would be like if cocaine was turned into a beat em up game
19843,"(UPDATED)

This game is one of the best on Steam and is highly recommended to anyone that likes side scrolling beat-em-ups.

There are pretty much no flaws in this game whatsoever, as the game play is incredibly fun, addicting and covered with fun little mini games like a volleyball match to beat the end of a specific level.

The game eases with your progression so there are no difficulty spikes while playing later levels and the game doesn't force you to shift your level up points in a specific area as that is up to the player.

Each boss is incredibly interesting with tons of character that make each one a fun experience to fight, almost parodying modern day boss battles.

There is not much of a story to this game as it pokes fun at the 'kidnapped princess' scenario in a hilarious manner.

This game can take between 10 - 15 hours to complete.

The ONLY issue I have is that there is not much of a reason to replay except to unlock weapons and characters that don't change much. (except for abilities)"
19844,fun with friends when i had some.
19845,"A friend gifted it to me, it was fun af"
19846,gud

Gameplay Sneak Preview:

https://youtu.be/p-N_W47qgQY"
19857,"Castle Crashers is one of many good coop games, supports online coop, and is fun to play alone. It has silly but vibrant graphics, a nonsensical, silly but funny story and characters with different magic skills. It’s a blast to play with friends and easy to run thanks to its simple, cartoon graphics.  You can buff your character’s different stats (strength, défense, magic, agility). Overall, this is a pretty neat game. Worth it, especially when discounted. Buy the 4 pack and get your friends to join you!
Graphics: 8/10 simple but fun.
Gameplay: 8/10 characters have different magic skills and you can learn new combos for your basic attacks.
Story: 8/10 good bosses and variation in enemies
Replayability: 8/10 complete the campaign with friends switching characters and this gives the game a slightly new feel. Always fun as long as with friends."
19858,It's a superfun game that brings back memories.
19859,fun to play with friends
19860,played this game a lot super fun and if u get bored of it u can just come back like 3 months later and play it with some friends again and its all fresh and epic again
19861,Legendary

I‘ve been waiting to play this game for a long while. Before a friend gave it to me as a present, I have never played such a hilarious combat game.
Thumb-up. Hoping the creaters make more funny but rad game like this one.

19883,"10/10 perfect for LAN parties

2d hack&slash game with cute graphics.

-Gameplay is rather basic and chill; Beat the baddies with melee weapons, bows and magic. As you progress you'll be able to perform various fun combos. 

-Quest line is rather short but not repeatitive. There'll be bosses at the end of each level and in order to beat them you'll need to develop tactics according to their weaknesses. Pretty classic

-As much as it's fun to play in multiplayer, single player is rather boring so i'd not recommend it if you're going to play on your own (also not too many people play the game so don't rely on finding online teams) Just grab it, get some people to play with you and have fun."
19884,"Yes, nice game. Didn't even realize there were over 30 characters and not just 4."
19885,"  Castle Crashers still holds up as one of my favourite games from my childhood (played it for the first time back in 2011 on my PS3).
  One of its best features is to enable for you to play with friends in local or online mode, the big variety of playable characters, the weapons and skill customization (which lets you choose the way you play, such as choosing a melee, a magic or archery combat approach) and also the perk-giving pets.
  The minigames are okay, even though the ""The Final Countdown"" achievement is really hard to get in solo mode, but I think they should add the Volleyball one to the minigame list as well, like what the PS3 edition has/had.  
  The game is pretty short to complete, but still fun to do so, despite me having completed dozens of times in the past, so I definitely recommend this game."
19886,"It's great, silly fun! Reminds me of the old days of armorgames 
"
19887,"Pretty Great Game. Behemoth has always been a very supportive developer, and always made a hit. With the newer release of Pit People (a game that personally, doesn't appeal very much) I decided to revisit castle crashers, now on my new pc being able to run remastered. Just as the original, the game is amazing. There is a great replayability rate, and has a almost non-existant storyline, but this storyline that is all over the place, is a good thing in this game. The cutscenes aren't really story based, but the whole game revolves around the exploration and retreiving back the crystal and princesses. The exploration, I mean, is how you litterally go to a forest, a beach, a boat, a marsh, a mountain on a full moon, and so many more."
19888,"I launched the game
all clear
working
over and out
+"
19889,"I remember playing the demo when I was younger and I enjoyed every minute of it (along with with all the times I replayed it).
Pros
Different playstyle for characters
Multiplyer (online and local)
Fun combos
Nice art style
Extra gamemodes

Cons
I haven't finished it
There are probably a lot of people who can point out this games flaws, but I can't lol.
"
19890,sidescrolling where u fight enemies
19891,this is amazing game and if you play it with friends it is even better. Today I and my friend completes the game and how i said  before it is amazing.
19892,"Played this one a ton back when it was released on XBLA during its ""Summer of Arcade"" deal which was trying to establish indie games being released on its platform as a selling point (holy crap that was 10 years ago). Game is a ton of fun with 4 player co-op, a ton of unlockables, some character growth and customization and a great art stlye. There have been games that have come out since then that have innovated on the formula a bit, but I don't think anyone has done it quite as well as The Behemoth."
19893,"good story good look good game modes awesome game
[spoiler]crazy bosses that kill you[/spoiler]"
19894,Great couch co-op game. Played with my SO and had a great time.
19895,Can't even see the character but managed to come out on top
19896,"very nice, brings me back to the good days"
19897,Really funny and entertaining for playing with frinds
19898,"Alright. The ""0.4 hours on record"" sounds dumb as hell but...
BUY THIS GAME NOW!
At the time of writing this, it is New Years Day and its £1.99. I've played this game back to back every once in a while for over 4 years on the Xbox 360 and loved it.
This game is so fun and is great to replay everytime. I like to finish it on my own then co-op with randos THEN co-op with my mates. This is a great beat-em-up. You should get it.
-------------
TL;DR: Games great, Replayed over and over for 4 years. Buy it."
19899,Daughters fav game.
19900,"I remember playing the demo on the PS3 and thoroughly remember the catchy song ""Jumper""."
19901,Bravo
19902,classic good game that is a blast on multiplayer
19903,Issa goud game
19904,"Hello,

This  is avesome game. Fun to run true it with friend even my GF loved it."
19905,"This game is great, especially if you like this genre. Also you can get a lot of playtime from it if you go for 100%"
19906,cool game with goat ball
19907,"Love this game, great for local co-op. Didnt play much online because of the small number of players online and most of them with lag :( 8/10"
19908,"its very fun to play with 1-3 friends and this game won't make u disappointed. (there is some fun stuff like pooping deer at beginning of the game, but if you goes on  you can't really find fun stuff in the game.)"
19909,it fun
19910,"Played over 1000 hours on xbox 360, Good game but I dont know how I played it that long"
19911,fun to play with friends
19912,First time players will have fun. Not fun if playing for nostalgia.
19913,yeah this game sucks
19914,An amazing game i really like this kind of games where u learn fighting skills during the levels you pass trough i recommed playing with friends since multiplayer is kind fo dead however u can still do the missions alone they are harder but more rewarding :D!
19915,"fuck game,  Buy the game to play only 1 time, the remaining times have to fix multiplayers errors. Last but not possible and no refund. FUCK GAME."
19916,A classic beat-em-up. Good music and recognizable characters from a newgrounds fondly remembered. Easy to get into and four-player online co-op makes it a no brainer if you enjoy a fun multiplayer experience.
19917,9/10
19918,great game
19919,I WILL LOVE THIS GAME FOREVER
19920,geniuenly one of the best games i have ever played
19921,"[h1]Classic beat-'em-up with Newgrounds vibes. Save princesses, kiss clowns, commence poop jokes, and more.[/h1]

[b] ""Free"": I recieved this game as a gift. [/b] 
[i]Note:[/i] This review is coming from someone new to playing this genre (beat 'em up), but not new to indie games. A Steam controller has also been used for all gameplay of this game.
I have also yet to finish the game firsthand, but I have seen the ending.

Castle Crashers is one of those games where it's been out for a while, all my friends and family have played it, and I haven't. Now I can (proudly?) say I have.
I can't quite put my finger on why I keep loading up this game, because from my perspective, this beat 'em up game is...well...[i]just that[/i]. 
I can't say I [i]dislike[/i] this game...but I also can't say I like it either. But it's addicting(?) enough that I apparently keep coming back to it despite getting tired of playing one session quicker than most of my other games.

I can only truly recommend this game for people who [i]are not[/i] like me. I am someone who enjoys Visual Novels, Science Fiction, Narratives, Exploration, and the like. Beat 'em up and hack 'n' slash games are not usually my forte.

I also highly recommend this game for people who enjoy playing games with friends. 
It's simple, it's fun, and it's easy to pick up and play. It's easy to keep playing...so as long as your level 70+ friend doesn't start your level 1 character on the last stage. (Not that I speak from experience or anything) 
Depending on the nature of your friend, the experience can be more or less frustrating, but isn't that what multiplayer games are all about? (Hell if I know)

Hell, do I like this game?
...
Shit I'll recommend, why not.

[i]Edited for formatting purposes.[/i]"
19922,cute little fun game
19923,fun af with friends
19924,10/10 would get gangbanged by industrialists and fencers on insane mode again
19925,">Be me, someone who is in Newgrounds since summer 2008

>Buys Castle Crashers

>Nostalgia hits me like a bullet train

>Rates it a straight 10/10

>Keeps replaying the Conehead Groom boss fight because ""Till Death Do You Part"" and organ cannon"
19926,"Its very good! I have zero complaints about it, yet there is one... why isnt there more like it? 9/10."
19927,"i like this game its fun also i like playing with other players i will recommend to this game also i think it should be free to let other people play this game if there poor

Edit: im evil now make it still payed "
19928,The orange dress princess is a fucking a clown
19929,.....
19930,Pretty good if you like beating stuff over over again.
19931,its ok i guess
19932,it is pretty good ;)
19933,"Behemoth really made a name for themselves with this game, and for good reason. The silly and absurd humor and tone, the very cartoony art style, and the solid controls and mechanics of the game makes for a very entertaing  and fun gaming experience."
19934,"good, goofy, and goregous game"
19935,The best game :D
19936,party game for party people
19937,One of the best multiplayer game I have played. Wish I had found it earlier...
19938,its too cartoonish to not be funny
19939,"Castle Crashers is the best game I've ever played and it deserves It's 10/10 steam rating. This games replay value is well past any other game I've played because of the fitting soundtrack, cool bosses and 31 total characters to play as. The harder mode you can play on as a character that has already beaten the normal campaign dubbed 'insane mode' is a very good challenge but has the possibillity to become tedious because the enimies have ten times their normal health.

Overall I rate this game 10/10 and recomend it to anyone who wants to just causilly play a game with some friends and listen to a good OST in the process."
19940,"This game is great.
First off, friends make it harder in some ways and easier in others.
Friends also make it more fun in almost every way.

Second off, Insane mode is insane. I can't beat the bees.
Friends only make it a little bit better.

Online mode unfortunately is kinda dead.

9/10 wish I had friends."
19941,"amazing game, love it. wish you didn't get magic spammed while you're already down but other than that it's great."
19942,Dont Buy Its Bad Like If Your Gonna Buy It Then Dont (I Totally Dont Recommend It)
19943,"Castle crashers is a game about killing barbarians, and aliens then saving princesses and fighting your friends to the death,

it's fun

 I don't know if I'd reccomend singleplayer but if you have 1 friend that will answer your calls and will play anything other than Fortnite then get this game and play it with them it's only $3 when it comes on sale, and this game is so much fun"
19944,This game a an enjoyable story playing with your friends was always as fun by yourself.
19945,"I love this game. I use to play this game when I was younger with my brother so it has a special place in my heart. When I got to replay it now, I relized how funny and good the plot was."
19946,greatest game in human history. green knight has 150% discipline
19947,Crazy frantic multiplayer mash that's best with three friends. Hilarious poop jokes.
19948,"Highly reccommebd this game! I have played it for a few years on my old xbox and finally was able to get it for PC, I have really loved everything about the game since I first found it, its fast paced and overall really fun! Its even better when you are playing eith family or friends.

I also highly reccommend their other games like Battle Block Theater and Alien Hominid !!"
19949,Very fun and challenging. I love games that give me reasons to keep playing and trying to unlock all the weapons and characters and pets is definatly something i enjoy doing.
19950,Story mode is great!!!
19951,I recommend this game.
19952,"Love this game. It is local co-op as well as online making it easy to play with friends. The gameplay is smooth, the tone is light hearted, and the secret items as well as unlockable characters increases the replay value largely. I play with my hardcore gamer friends as well as my wife who is a first time gamer and she is addicted. This is a game that can be picked up and enjoyed by all."
19953,"amazing game  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

"
19954,"Extreamly fun game, but sadly not much to do when you finish the main story."
19955,i love this game so much :))
19956,"Fun game, tons of replayability, but gets repetitive after a while. Combat and gameplay will be the exact same if you opt to play a physical based character every time you try out a new character. The only variation between characters is either cosmetic or through their magic abilities. The game is great co-op game but definitely is most fun during the first play through. Overall, a fun game that is worth the price."
19957,"This game is great no problems, the story is simple, the gameplay is fun, you can beat the everloving f*** out of your friends! What more does a game need also what you get for the $10 you spent on it is much replayability"
19958,"It's pretty great with a full party of people, but it's good enough for solo play as well."
19959,Jóia
19960,fun with friends
19961,Would Juggle again for 10 hours again 5 dead fish out of 6
19962,"i honestly like the game, it just a great way to spend time inbetween everything and i would always recomend it to others"
19963,good
19964,👍👍👍
19965,"Yes, It good"
19966,"vanquish enemies with stuffed animals as Pink Knight
10/10 would definitely recommend"
19967,amazing game!
19968,good game
19969,"This game was big for couch parties when I'd have my friends over. And since i found it on steam, I've been able to play it with those friends just the same, all the way across the continent. Other than that good old nostalgia for people like me, it is an excellent game to play with your friends, the more the merrier."
19970,I crashed a castle
19971,A great 2D Side scrolling Beat em` up game. This game is fun as hell and everyone would enjoy it I highly recomend getting this game for yourself and all your friends.
19972,BOOOOO this game sucks! Flash version was better.
19973,bad game
19974,"Several bugs and crashes on coop killed all my mood to keep playing this.
A few of the problems I encountered:
- Coop severe sync issues (me and my brother would have our games completely desync randonly in the middle of a mission, to the point where there was one time we were basicaly each soling our own version of the mission. He won his game and I lost mine, and reward unlocks confirmed it afterwards)
- Map glitches that stoped progress and required mission restart to get past it (like invisible walls on the way for instance)
- Coop crashes (several times)
- Coop DC's (several times, not internet issue)
Etc."
19975,"I was a pirat and even back than, when i knew i didn't have any way to buy things online, i just said that i will buy this game just to thank the devs, and so i did =)"
19976,"always used to play this game.
now i can play it more."
19977,"this game is truely amazing, great story, funny, and enjoyable to play with friends. I played most of it with Hatty Hattington from battleblock theater, and it was great. the only thing i would suggest is playing with a friend, its most most enjoyable then. 10/10"
19978,I love this game I grew up with it it's a very fun 2d scroller type game
19979,beautiful
19980,"EHHHH,I like grand strategy more, but for a story, it's decent."
19981,IDC
19982,Is good game. I like
19983,Funny humor and poop jokes
19984,"This was one of my favorite games as a kid, and I recently decided to pick it back up again just for the fun of it.

The result? I still love Castle Crashers just as much as I used to. Maybe even more so!

I love that the game (and Battleblock Theater, AND Pit People) continues to be updated, even years later! The Behemoth truly cares about its games and community."
19985,"Played it through multiple times, me and my wife loved it. Unique art style, funny moments, reindeer diarrhea... what more can you ask for?"
19986,Fun........... just fun
19987,Boom Swusshh Swung Pang
19988,One tap
19989,Browser game in quality
19990,Great comic graphics. Awesome sound. Funny story. Needs more people for coop. Also needs a sequel.
19991,"Very cute and fun to play with friends, but gets repetitive and boring kinda quickly, so it's like super fun but only for a short time ;u; Not as fun to play alone imo."
19992,Great Gameplay and hillarious with friends
19993,"It  is amazing with friends
"
19994,still waiting on a sequel...
19995,This is CLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASIC
19996,eh
19997,"Great music, great gameplay, and great visuals! What more can I say except buy this game? 10/10"
19998,"I first played this game on the xbox360 back in 2014 after I watched therunawayguys play it and sunk hours into it. After picking it up 4 years later, I can safely say that it has withstood the test of time and is still one of the most simple yet fun games out there and for £9.99 (£1.99 on sale), it's definitely worth the money you pay for it.

8/10"
19999,fun game but everyone has already played it
20000,Does anyone even still play this?
20001,Great game just great
20002,perfection even 6 years later
20003,"VERY GOOD GAME
basically childhood."
20004,"Amazing fun co-op beat 'em up game, I highly recommend it"
20005,GAEM GOOD 10/10
20006,Is fun with friends.Also the story is really funny and good.*clap clap*
20007,"Extremely fun with friends, i would say this game is extremely underrated"
20008,This game is pretty good! I recommend!
20009,"Ah, a classic"
20010,best 2d game i have ever played.Pros: multiplayer voce-chat Easy leveling system simple combat lots of bosses made by Tom Fulp Dan Paladin + Behemoth so uh you know its good Cons:wierd hitboxes (you cant attack bosses from 2d out of view but they still can) not a lot of without freinds and grinding is a little complicated
20011,if they made a castle crashers i would suck the developers left tiddy not the right one though. sorry.
20012,"hella good, pretty easy and fast normal mode, hard insane mode after beating normal mode, bunch of characters to unlock, bunch of weapons to unlock, bunch of pets to unlock, 99 levels to level up for each character. completionist's dream / nightmare. 9/10"
20013,good stuff
20014,this game better than fortnite
20015,"Das ist ein sehr nices Spiel. Besonders zu empfehlen mit einem Squad von ca. 2 Leuten. Schöne Animationen und trifft genau meinen Humor!
Empfehle es aufjeden Fall!"
20016,"Amazing game from the xbox 360 era, still fun to play in splitscreen co-op."
20017,"This game is great! U start off with a small choice of characters, but as you progress through the game you'll unlock more and more.

If u beat the story with a specific character, you will earn a new character. And if u beat the story with that character, you'll get another one! You get my point. 

Its great to play alone or with friends. Buy it, its great!"
20018,"Ahh. Good choice. I bought this game for a friend when it came out, for his birthday. I never sent it to him."
20019,Berry good game!
20020,"This game was an addiction. Me and my friends played this game so much, we got burned out. at that time, I was in college, and almost failed few exams, due to the addiction to this game. That is how great this game was.  Behemoth games really became famous after this game, and originally I played it on the ps3, but liked it so much I had to have it on steam as well. its has very colorful design, its a great beat em up that you will get addicted to if you have a bunch of friends in the house and miss some 4 player local party games. This is a must if you like beat em ups, I found it even more fun that scott pilgrim, and that one was good too."
20021,"Gotta be honest this game is really good, this game is challenging and fun at the same time, and characters I recommend is Fencer,Pink Knight,Red Knight,Bear And Brute/Snakey."
20022,"Fun game, good story and great multiplayer. 8/10"
20023,"fun coop mayhem, good humour, buy with at least one friend to play with"
20024,"I first played this game on Xbox 360 when it showed up, and is so dang fun and addicting. The mechanics are so easy that you can literally just button mash and make your way through if you want to, though actually putting thought and strategy into your moves does help with the more difficult bosses later on. But if you want a game that is both fun to play and really cute to look at, play Castle Crashers. You won't be disappointed."
20025,"Great game, but not enough hands. 3/10"
20026,good fun.
20027,"can i have a refund
"
20028,This is a great party game. Buy it.
20029,"The game has an amazing soundtrack, amazing gameplay. The best part is the co-op. The re-play value is there and it's amazing as well, you beat the game and unlock different characters to play as and enjoy! Highly recommend. 
 If you're interested I've played and beaten this game more times than I can count, and I stream on twitch.tv so if you would like come visit me on stream and talk about games with me! Twitch.tv/knightsoftheround"
20030,"Game was funny in middleschool, recommended ages 12 or less"
20031,fun
20032,Very Fun to play with friendsl. amazing unstressful game
20033,yes good
20034,I DEAMAND MY MONEY BACK I CANNOT GET PAST THE STUPID VOLLEYBALL LEVEL
20035,I completed this game multiple times on Steam. Now just multiply that by 10 and you got the number of runs I made on Xbox. Great game.
20036,"This game pretends to be a cutesy side-scrolling beat-em-up.

In reality, it is a nightmare of grinding.  

A pretty great co-op game though!  Just be prepared to suffer through some glitches - this game has a lot of them."
20037,I've always loved Castle Crashers since I first played it on Xbox 360 back in 2009 and I still love to play it on Xbox One but I don't have many hours on steam
20038,i am a misogynist 👍
20039,Obviously an amazing classic. Great replayibility with friends.
20040,Great game. Had fun and laughed a lot.
20041,The only game that my daughter (5½) loves truly. Perfect couch share screen coop.
20042,"Very fun game to play if you wanna betrayl your friends in exchange for a waifu princess.
Would betray them more."
20043,Good game
20044,Don't even think about buying this game! JUST BUY IT!! It's a Super fun game!!! I highly recommend it! Even more fun with friends!
20045,"Graphics are cute, Amazing game too."
20046,"BEST COOP ARCADE!   
I really wish for a 2nd game!

I want to relive this game!  PLZ make another!!"
20047,"Had this on the Xbox360 years ago - brings back so many memories.
One of the best side-scrollers I’ve ever played and cant wait to get my teeth back into this once again..

Smashed Extreme Mode on the 360 and plan to do so again.
Wicked/Fluid/Great Controls.
Wicked Gameplay and LOLs.
Plenty of replay ability. 
Plenty of Nostalgia for moi!
10/10 - would Crash again and again."
20048,"Play this amazing game with friends, or by yourself, but really with friends. This game is great, buy it."
20049,arcade style adventure game kill everyone no prisoners bad poop jokes 8/10
20050,good

20056,love the op combows
20057,IT IS THE BEST GAME OF 2012
20058,A lot of fun and a lot of button mashing. Really fun and enjoyable game which you don't have to take too seriously.
20059,:D
20060,"A Great Game Love All Of The Charaters And The Little Secrets, Great Humor, Big Map,Great Multiplayer Game!!!"
20061,"I used to play this on the xbox and it was an ok game. I couldn't get into it as much due to the serious amount of button mashing hurting my hand after an hour.. So I decided to try it on the PC when it came out. They didn't optimize it or change it at all from the console. You can't even use magic properly on the keyboard. If you don't change a console game to be PC ready, it isn't really a PC game, now is it..?"
20062,play this with friends and you will have a heck a time
20063,so fun that i think ill play till i get enough for a ps4
20064,"Weird online connection this one time I played it

0/10"
20065,fun game with friends
20066,Great and fun game but the matchmaking system is bullshit.
20067,Yes.
20068,fun with friends
20069,A lot of fun and a lot of button mashing. Really fun and enjoyable game which you don't have to take too seriously.
20070,"If you hate non-stop, endless fun, this isn't your game. But if you DO like the thrill of beating that one level and constant fun with friends or solo, I would recommend you buy this game. [b]BUY IT[/b]"
20071,I played this game for 3 days straight so far i love it.I am glad they added the alien from alien hominid that was a great game.I hope they add that game one day to steam.
20072,I had so much fun playing this game if you dont have it buy it its amazing
20073,"Stupidly childish. I kinda regret trying to unlock classes, since there's not a lot of differences for a casual player. I'd have enjoyed it more if I were a decade or more younger I'm sure. Was fun with friends though."
20074,"This Game is Amazing, tons of other people agree, and go into detail about why, just go get it."
20075,old but a classic
20076,Not even gonna try insane mode
20077,actualy you can play with your friends and thats funny but some bugs are incredible.
20078,why does steam say i have it i dont
20079,good with friends but singleplayer ain't really that good
20080,"Really great game, played on the Xbox 360 before switching over to PC, endless fun!"
20081,perfect
20082,Absolutely love it
20083,Fun
20084,This Game is good... even after 10 years
20085,"Pretty fun game, but don't expect to play if for more than a week. Only buy this if you have more friends to play it with."
20086,"Es un juego casual que puede llevarte a horas de diversion, se disfruta mucho mas con amigos pero igual es muy divertido de cualquier manera"
20087,good meme 10/10
20088,"I remember playing this game with some of my friends drunk for the first time and it was a blast. Maybe not worth $14, so definitely wait for a sale. But a fun game to play none the less to pass the time and get a couple laughs and enjoy playing with a couple of friends while hanging out."
20089,Yes
20090,"The more friends you have to play this with the better. Grab this game and hit up your squad for some couch co-op action, lots of laughs, and a great time."
20091,"I did not like this game, it portrays wizards / people who use magic as trash, everyone who focuses on magic in the game is very weak !!! the only way to progress is to improve the attack, otherwise the magic is very weak. Wizards are far more powerful than warriors in every game, I bet the developers were envious of wizards always standing in front of warriors."
20092,This Game Is So Gut. I Like It. So Cool.
20093,im enjoying this
20094,I was supposed to patrol thots not fight for them smh
20095,Hard but fun.
20096,"Castle Crashers is the game that introduced the masses to the incredible animations of Dan Paladin, and the astonishing musical talent that existed within the Newgrounds community, circa 2007. It's a rusting monument to a flash website that forged so much of our modern (2018 at the time of this review) online culture and the personalities who dominate it. This game is NG at its best, and for those of you old enough to remember when that was...well, you probably already own  the game. If not, buy it and enjoy a sublime trip down memory lane.

And for everyone else, yeah. It's a pretty fun game to play through.
It gets my recommendation."
20097,"This game is a nice game to sit back and play to, I have a lot of fun playing it with friends or just by myself!"
20098,hm
20099,"Still have yet to beat the game, but playing with others and slaying things is very fun!"
20100,Prostate
20101,"It's a great game, i think you should buy it!"
20102,"Nice art style, OST and design, but the poop jokes made me cringe haHAA
I think multiplayer is even better than playing alone since it's fun :)"
20103,"I like the game and stuff but steam stuck my game play time at 19 mins for some reason. I played this for at least 3 hrs and anytime I finish the session, it goes to what its supposed to be (ex. I played for 30 mins that session, it will show 49 mins) but then it just reverts back to 19 mins for no reason. Please can someone tell me how to fix this so I can rank up my hours?"
20104,meh. bad without controller
20105,it funy game when you play co op
20106,good game
20107,The best game in my life!

20121,10/10 Game
20122,"Buckle in boi's, this game is the bees knees in strengthening your comrade's/main squeeze's bonds for years on end.

This quirky and whimisically action packed adventure is sure to bring a cherishable joy to everyone that is exposed to its' hack and slash, beat the tar out of everyone goodness. Co-op only enhances the infectiously splendiferous vibes of camaraderie in tandem with a fantabulously catchy soundtrack to boot! Keep on keepin' on lads and lassies."
20123,Fantastic fun and incredibly simple. Great with friends or on your own. Worth picking up.
20124,Hilarious and great co-op game for up to 4 people.
20125,Back off Barbarian...you cruel mistress...

20127,One of the best local co-op games on Steam.
20128,"Don't mind me, just one more positive vote to contribute to the extremely positive."
20129,From showing off your skills to your friends to finding little animal orbs or unlocking dope characters Castle crashers have a lot to offer and is the funniest game to play especially with friends it’s a blast to complete quests with each other. This game is also a big throwback of nostalgia and has great graphics for how long ago it was made. I definitely suggest playing this with your friends or even if your just looking for a solo adventure and one other thing is pink knight is completely OP.
20130,If you like games in any capacity you owe it to yourself to play this at least once. For a small price of just 2.99 there is no way it could be dissapointing. I love this game!
20131,Amazing to play with freinds! Great fun to smash through the levels and boses
20132,I hate the fucking valleyball

20189,"This game lies, in no part of the game do you 'Crash Castles'."
20190,Good
20191,"To me this is a nolstagic classic. Had this when it first came out on Xbox 360, then got it on my previous Steam account and now it comes to this one. All those years of me playing this game and I still adore it. A comical and fun beat em up that's so full of life. No matter how many times I go back to it I have fun and enjoy me play time, even if it does feel repeated at times. Behemoth is one of my favorite game companies and this is the first and favorite game of theirs I've played. 

The game isn't anything too complex. All you gotta do is rescue four princesses , as a variety of different characters, the clutches of the evil wizard and gang. But that simple experience you play through is worth every minute. The other game modes also add to the fun but it doesn't take long for you to move on to the next one. Playing with friends is highly recommended however. 10/10 will remain as one of my favorite games ever."
20192,"Really fun game with easy to learn controls and abilities that it gives you in a drip feed like way so it's much simpler to understand. Also great with friends as it has 4 player co-op so it feels like the couch co-op games of yore, and the art style is quite humourous."
20193,beautiful game
20194,Still love this game play threw it once a year atlest
20195,good
20196,"reviewing this game for a badge 

fun game by the way

play with friends if you have some"
20197,"I swear to god i will Crucify any Person who says this game is s h i t.
Not only is this like, the childhood co-op that changed all hack and slash games,
its Made from B e h e m o t h. The creators of aline humanoid, Chainsaw dad, and like a crap ton of iconic Newgrounds charcters. You have to be Living under a rock to say ""there meh"".
Apart from that, the game is a solid 9/10. Id make it higher, but honestly i cant.
SIngle player is actually boo boo, but playing with your friends is a Blast.
Lots of interesting jokes, charcters, enoviroments. Pretty much everything has its own style too it. Sadly most fan favorite bosses are kinda Meh. Most of there attacks are really spammy, but if you get over that there pretty good.
Gameplay is Hella good too, escpaiecally juggeling eneimies with your friends to get insane combos.
Artstyle is amazing for the time it came out, and even now its still charming.
I honestly only have good things to say for this game, since ive never could see any bugs or glitches.
Hope you ejnjoy it as much as i do, even doe i havent played as much as most people."
20198,fun to play with friends
20199,its ok
20200,Pure beat'em up mayhem and a must play with friends.
20201,Have few gamepads? Have friends to play with? What are you waiting for?! This game truly shines in local co-op! I would recomend it to anyone who likes classic beat em up style game with nice graphics and so much humour all mixed together!
20202,asdf
20203,fun with friends
20204,Fun with friends
20205,"One of the best games ive played, and so the experience is incrased on this already masterpiece is by playing it online with friends"
20206,Best in Twitter pl.
20207,"I have lost count on how many times I have replayed this, it's always fun to go back and play it with another friend through remote play together if they don't have it."
20208,Bash their skulls in!
20209,Killed my bro for a hoe. 10/10 would do it again
20210,I like it. Still struggling to get Juggling right. But it s a fun struggle.
20211,"Great game to play alone or with friends.  Campaign is well don and the characters are well crafted.  Buy it, you won't regret it."
20212,cant understand why the tuск this game has 97% positive reviewes. i had no real fun
20213,This game is a amazing lil game that will make you happy with or without friends. Oh and speedruns of it are awesome
20214,"One of the best co-op beat em up games and the nostalgic feeling with it, remembering all the times when I was on a newgrounds website."
20215,Fun game
20216,"I heavily enjoyed this game because it is a remastered version of an X-Box 360 Game that I put almost 200 hours into. Sure, the game gets mad if you don't have a controller (I did), it is quite nostalgic (lack of better word) for me and it might be for you as well, if you decide to purchase it. If there was a star system, it would get five in my opinion. Thank you Behemoth and Steam for formatting this game for PC."
20217,The gameplay (with a controller) is really immersive and also humorous xd
20218,"very fun, even alone this game is wonderful, no bugs that i've personally expericenced, thank you behemoth very cool."
20219,best co-op game
20220,"Once a goon, forever a goon.
Gather friends, fight through bad jokes, mobs of men, [spoiler] volleyball [/spoiler] and bosses and then take out your aggression on their loot whoring through the arena to win the affection you wish you had in real life!"

20222,great game worth the money if you have a controller
20223,"Great party game, it's also not a bad single player game. Up to 4 players, easy to pick up.

Working fine on linux with wired/wireless xbox 360 controllers and ps3 controllers. Not a single issue."
20224,fun
20225,Outstanding & racuous co-op fun.
20226,the most exellent of games
20227,if only i had a friend
20228,Very good
20229,"Great classic game, needs friends to yell at for full enjoyment."
20230,this game is pretty easy and fun with friend
20231,It's good.
20232,"This game has been out for six years at the time of this review. It's still as fun as the day I first bought it.  Seamless and fluent combat with beautiful Flash graphics.  My only complaint is the difficulty of the ""Insane Mode"""
20233,Great game to play with friends would like like to see some updates and new content
20234,An absolute must have for anyone looking for a fun and silly platformer!
20235,Good.
20236,Honestly great fun for you and a group of friends or by yourself. I have this for both Xbox 360 and PC love the game!
20237,"What can I say? It's The Behemoth's handwritten signiture, and has all sorts of strange (but funny) moments."
20238,It's a great game to kill time with friends and has some very funny moments.
20239,"este juego merece ser el juego del año, ya que su mecanica es muy buena y su estilo de dibujo magnifica mis diez"
20240,"I love this game to pieces, I remember the simple days on xbox 360, getting home, loading up this game and playing it through with my friend, only to do the same the next day. The game is short enough to play in a day, but it has always been so fun. Unlocking every animal and playing with a different character in order to unlock more gives the players who love this game a longer more fulfilling experience. The mixture of the welcoming art style, amazing soundtrack, fun gameplay and altogether replayability leaves this game with a strong review. I can say after playing this game after 6 years that it still holds together perfectly and has the same affect it had on me before as it does now. A truly amazing experience I hope everyone can appreciate. Give this game a go, you might find it to be a favourite. 10/10"
20241,Played this so much in Highschool and it still holds up. Met the devs at Tokyo Game show at 2009/10 and they were the cool dudes. Good party game or a game to just hangout and play with friends.
20242,Old but Gold
20243,"One of the best games I've ever played with friends. It's still fun solo, don't get me wrong, but when my friends and I start mucking about together here the game becomes more entertaining, especially when you get to the princesses.

The game itself is very straightforward: fight off enemies, face the boss, kiss the princesses. But don't let such a basic plotline fool you: the Behemoth's charm they add to every game makes Castle Crashers really fun. Humorous cutscenes, aesthetically pleasing environments and simple mechanics make this game one of my favorites ever."
20244,Played on PS3. It was my favorite 2D game and it still is.
20245,Top !
20246,Fun with friends
20247,Is good game
20248,"Fun alone, but more fun with friends"
20249,Still one of the best games to play with friends ever.
20250,Todos tem que dar uma chance para essa obra prima
20251,nice game
20252,"I've replayed this game so many times and each run through I play with friends, it's always a great time. The artstyle, simplistic hack-and-slash mechanics, and comedic bits of this game is what really makes this game a living legend throughout time."
20253,Fajna gra
20254,This is just a quality title you can play for hours on end
20255,It's good
20256,emm
20257,Great with friends
20258,Nice coop game (up to 4 players). Repetitive gameplay after completing game once.
20259,"Its a really good game,i had a lot of fun playing this game with my friends.If you have some friends to play this game with then this would be the best choice for you in my opinion.When it got free we had 2 days to finish it.Just because of that we hopped on to our computers when we got in home. 10/10 from me <3"
20260,A great game to play with friends. It holds up as a solo experience pretty well too.
20261,Super fun game with friends
20262,"This a 10 year old game that holds up very very well in terms of gameplay. On the other hand the online sucks because the waiting time for someone to join your lobby is 10min+.  Also, most of the time the people you play with often have very high ping thus making the game almost unplayable. Other than that this is a game that every casual gamer must have in their collection!"
20263,"Very fun game, especially if you play it with friends.
Getting all the achievements is kinda tedious and time consuming doe"
20264,"Very fun game to play with friends, I love the graphics and universe !"
20265,"Great game, but best played with friends."
20266,Great Game!
20267,nice
20268,"Playing alone is okay....
But playing with friends makes it a way more ""immersive"" experience.....

Who am I kidding? Immersion out the window, bashing heads, riding fish and watching animals poop, that's how a good game has to be!"
20269,A whole lot of fun with friends!
20270,"This game is absolutely amazing. It can run on basically anything. It has cartoony graphic and the characters have comical expressions. This game is very comedic and fun,However, when you play this game too much you will get bored of it but you will come back and play it again and the cycle goes on. I rate this a solid 9/10."
20271,This game is fun if u have friends... its a shame i dont have any :(
20272,awesome game with friends :D
20273,A reallyfun game' whith alot of things to do.
20274,game is alot of fun
20275,"Castle Crasher is a 4 player, side scrolling beat em' up, which you can play both couch co-op and online together with your friends, family, or even strangers you meet online and have fun!
Controller is highly recommended as you beat up enemies and rack up sick combo numbers and decimate the bosses in stylish fashions and takedowns."
20276,"Overall, its just a great co-op game to play with your friends (or, whats left of them anyways)."
20277,best game I ever played on the 360
20278,"The game is fun. But i find it stupid how in the first few levels it gives you an army of archers to fight alone. Literally. 
"
20279,"Short review:

Love it! Don't forget to play this with your friend!!
8/10"
20280,"A classic. A game that you can come back to a lot and it always remains just as fun. It's always more fun with friends too, so good for a thing to do with your buddies now and then as well.
Its cartoony humor and beat-em-up gameplay still live strongly today."
20281,"Great
"
20282,"I loved this game, it was funn. 8/10"
20283,"I am not exaggerating when I say that buying a four pack of this game so I could play it with three friends is easily the best return on investment I’ve made on steam in years!

The game play and controls for this game are familiar to most of us, and for everyone else they are extremely easy to learn. 

The music is amazing, full of energy and emotion! You’ll often find yourself in the middle of a boss fight feeling every single note as the soundtrack urges you to give it your all!

The artwork is fantastic, cartoony and emotive while somehow managing to also be pretty dark in places. The character animations for the knights you play and the enemies you fight are smooth and creative.

The story is engaging, full of urgency and yet absolutely hilarious in places.

This is easily one of the most enjoyable games I’ve ever played."
20284,"One of the best games out there, and even better with friends."
20285,"I have been playing this game since i came out on the 360, and i have to say i love it, the gameplay is amazing solo and multi, every time you try to level up a character it feels like a different game, 10/10 would play again"
20286,VERY GOOD VIDEO GAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE YOU PLAY HAVE FUNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!
20287,I had loads of fun playing this when it came out and I still do.

20292,Great Game to sit back relax and smash things.
20293,fookin castle crashers right on lad
20294,Castle Crashers is honestly one of the funest casual games games that you can play with your friends. It has plenty of content  and its fun to go through it all.
20295,"One of the best ""Beat 'em ups"" off all time!"
20296,"Real solid game, great for couch parties, once you get combos down it's not as frustrating, haven't had a bas time playing it"
20297,"Fun with messing around with friends, looks nice"
20298,awesome game to play co-op
20299,"This is not a single player game, you must have friends to have maximum enjoyment.  I probably put thousands of hours into this on the xbox, and enjoyed all of it. If you buy the four pack, troll one of your friends by making them play green knight."
20300,This game is extremely fun to play. I've completed this game so many times by myself and with friends. It's a great way to kill time.
20301,"In 2018, this game still holds up as a fun, wacky adventure you and your friend(s) can play, and it's cheap on steam sales, so thats a plus in my book."
20302,It is better with friends as the nomination suggests
20303,Had a lot of fun playing through this with my girlfriend.
20304,Let play with your friends and smile with them!!!
20305,"I think this game is great, the artstyle is very nice, you can play local-coop, which is a lot of fun, and it' s funny.
If you want to buy this game, go find a friend with who you can play. It makes this game a lot more fun then it already is.

Im sorry if my english is bad, its not my main Language.
This is also my first review ever so it isn't that good."
20306,Castle Crashers is an amazing game. I really enjoy playing it and the game is only made better when played with friends.
20307,"Good Game,"
20308,its okay
20309,This game is still one of the best and funniest beat em ups i've ever played and I would recommend this anytime to play with a groups of friends for a great time. 100/100
20310,"Good game, hade lots of fun with it and even more fun with friends."
20311,nice hack-and-slash game to play with or without your friends <3

11/10 would fight giant river cat again"
20334,"This is one of the best co-op games out there. There are multiple difficultys to play on and different characters,weapons, and pets to unlock. It's overall a really great game buy it if you can or just steal your dad's credit card and hope he doesn't find out"
20335,A great game whether you're on single player or multiplayer mode. Provides more than enough gameplay for the value of your money. 10/10!

20347,"Amazingly good fun, a game with a good sense of humour. It's challenging without feeling too stressful, you'reable to grow with the game. 
Also if you can, while it is fun in singleplayer, this is a game that is improved even further by playing with friends."
20348,Pretty good
20349,knights and stuff

20352,It's good.
20353,My kids love playing this when their friends are over.
20354,dank game
20355,One hell of a challenging game. A classic which has aged well through the years and a game I still come back to every now and then for the mechanics and the challenge.
20356,nice game.
20357,"verry good, played alot with Budder28 (go add her). much fun very wow 8.5/10"
20358,If you dont like this game then u dont deserve to be alive.... lol
20359,Great game to play with friends
20360,"great fun with friends. eating pizza, playing this ^.^"
20361,"If there is one game I can come back to anytime, it's Castle Crashers. Play through it once, and it's a beautifully crafted game with great art and music and beat-em-up. Play through it again to reenjoy it. While I may not sit and play this game for hours on end, I know without a doubt that every few months I will boot it back up to play through the great game again!"
20362,great
20363,A fun game to play with friends
20364,This is probably one of the best games i have ever played and after all these years the game is still one of the best side scrolling beat em ups i have played with an awesome sound track an awesome quest and a call back to some of their older games and the game gets even better with friends and its a game i reccomend buying and getting 4 friends together to play
20365,"loved it as a flash game, now its better!"
20366,Very cool & very interested man
20367,Great game i spend a lot of time playing it when im bored
20368,10/10 Would stab allies in the back to get the princess again!!!
20369,Have the craziest time with my friends X)
20370,it good
20371,It is a very fun game to play with your friends if you wanna buy it do it but the grafics are not very good that is the only thing
20372,yeah
20373,Honestly one of the games that will never get old. One of the best multiplayer games out there.
20374,great fun espicially with friends.
20375,"This game was a joy to play while it lasted. There are many pros to this game, all the sprites in the game a beautifully illiustrated and coloured, the gameplay is well thought out, the controls are easy to pick up and the characters are well balanced. However the game has it's downsides, replay ability is an issue in that the game can easily get repetitive if you've completed it before, the combat mechanics are a little difficult to get the hang of as all the sprites are 2D but movement is on a 3D axis and the game isn't fun to play alone, perhaps that's just me but I found that unless you are playing co-op with a couple friends the game isn't very fun.

Overall I would definately reccomend this game to anyone looking for a well made co-op game to play with friends.
7.5/10"
20376,"Honestly, this game is a classic, and whenever friends say they are looking for a multiplayer game to play, this is my go to. The only flaws with this game are A) It's not nearly as enjoyable of an experience without friends and B) The gameplay feels much worse without a controller.
Solid 9.5/10"
20377,Great game <3
20378,Very fun and for $3 solid couple hours of fun
20379,"Dank as hell. Please make a sequel, i've been waiting fucking 10 years don't pull the Half-Life 2 shit on me Behemoth"
20380,play it with friends and you'll get a lot of fun
20381,"Fun game, but you'll need friends for max. enjoyment"
20382,"enjoyed ever bit of the game, would recommend"
20383,Good game to play with your kid.
20384,"still a fun game plenty of years after its original release, great fun, but you almost need at least one other friend, robot companion or a cat to have the most fun with this game"
20385,"It's wonderfully stupid fun.

And it's still getting updates to keep it running."
20386,MASTERPIECE
20387,the good shit
20388,"A super fun wee co-op game full of plenty of opportunities for causing chaos with friends. Well worth picking up, especially on sale!"
20389,"I love this game. I've bought it multiple times (360, PC, gift on PC, and XB1) everyone should own this game no excuses"
20390,"An absolute favorite, I remember buying this game in my xbox 360, then my xbox one, and now on the PC.

This is a gem of a game that everyone should try."
20391,"Great game, even better with friends"
20392,Fun with friends
20393,"Welp its 2018 and ohhh man is this game awsome. From an artistic standpoint the behemoth has hit the nail with the 2D character design and mass of worlds to visit and the ability to fight monsters of many different races. Aside from fighting monsters you can collect new swords and new kights along your journy with silly pets that can give you an edge in a fight depending on the situation. The story isnt complex but does exist and is followed throught the game, it is just your basic save the princes story as far as ive seen.  The game does get challengeing at some points and confuseing in some bits but overall is beatable, i hightly recoemnd to play with friend/s through it will make is so much less challenging trust me (like a vollyball match) and there are some added bits when playing with friends. My one true complaint is the ammount of stun lock in this game i have lost entire levles due to this feature, yes it help in the begining but after that it gets in the way of gameplay. But, aside from that its a solid game not perfect but still fun, silly, expansive, and smells of the Newgrounds Era. 8/10 for me"
20394,Hatty Hattington has the power of friendshipness to guide him
20395,"Very fun game, playable over lan, unlike many other games of the same type."
20396,old game but still fun
20397,love this game. beat it like a billion times!
20398,best game 2024
20399,"super fun to play with friends, defenitly recommend you to grab a few friends and getting togther to play this fun playful game"
20400,Actually quite fun. Get a friend or two to play with you.
20401,"good game, better with friends"
20402,Good game
20403,"best 4 player co op game I have ever played, please release a sequal!"
20404,castle crahers 2 when
20405,Good Times
20406,"buen juego, bastante divertido :D"
20407,gud gam
20408,this game is fun and bettter with friends.
20409,This game is a classic that I played long ago and still enjoy playing today and inviting people to play as well.
20410,I love this game so much even 10 years later<3
20411,This game is very replayable and the insane difficulty is challenging
20412,"Fantastic game to play with friends, with tons of characters to develop that while small, have their differences and the chance to build them to your style I think this game is quite great to play, especially with a full party!"
20413,Amazing
20414,"INCREDIBLE WITH FRIENDS, HOLY SHIT. wait, I don't have friends :("
20415,A fun and addicting game to play solo or with friends. Highly recommended!
20416,nice
20417,"Extremely fun game, owned it for the XBox 360 and bought it again on Steam. I can easily spend multiple hours with friends beating up enemies and not get bored. The game gets less appealing when you are playing alone. If you have a save with a character that you have been playing with others and try to pick up at the same location there will be a drastic difficulty change."
20418,Because of #&@* Steam rewards! Best coop game ever.
20419,Funny game I enjoyed the poop
20420,One of the best fun Co-op games out there.
20421,"Most funny game ever created, with the best developers making it, its so well made."
20422,really fun to play especially with friends because that game is one of those if you dotn have many people to play it will get boring fast but with friends you can easily play for hours
20423,"I'm writing this review for the autumn sale badge, great game though."
20424,Old but gold. Pure co-op fun. Grab one-two-three friends and go kick the evil's butt!
20425,Its ok I guess
20426,"I have been playing this game ever since it came out, and its still one of my most favorite games. Although it can be boring sometimes playing as a new character and going through the entire story over and over again, in the end its all fun. Personally I think you should play this game with friends and also use a controller."
20427,mhm
20428,One of the most addicting and satisfying beat-em-ups I've ever played. Slash and cast spells to defeat hordes of enemies with your friends in co-op (highly recommended) alongside derpy cartoony visuals and an epic soundtrack. Behemoth knows how to make a damn fun game.
20429,"Such a great game to play with friends, take a load off, complete and overall i love its comedic nature"
20430,"It's a fun time with friends, it's a fun time alone.

The stages are diverse, with their own unique mechanics, and their bosses too.

The combat consists mostly of air juggling enemies, nothing too interesting there, but that way of playing is optional. If you wanna have fun playing some other way go for it.

The story is really funny, and the cutesy artstyle is helping.

The replayability consists mostly in unlocking other characters.

TL;DR: Fun party game you can play even without friends and still have fun. Highly recommended."
20431,"the subtle humour in this game is brilliant, a must play with friends, bit boring if you're running solo"
20432,Fun with friends
20433,Great game solo. Even better multiplayer
20434,This game has to be one of my all time favorites. I would highly recommend playing this with friends.
20435,Castle Crashers 2 please Behemoth.
20436,awesome OK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20437,nice game
20438,i like this game
20439,A great pick-up-and-play arcade style beat 'em up that offers a nice mix of challenge and humor.
20440,"Castle crashers is a classic, it is the game that got me into indie gaming when I first got started with gaming. The comedy and the art in this game is amazing and still holds up even today. The combat is simple yes but I don’t think that detracts from the experience of picking it up with a couple of friends and doing a quick run through. Castle crashers should be in the library of every gamer with a love for indie games."
20441,"Very fun with other people that you are with, despite the 2D game that this provides, it can give a bonding experience with your teammates/"
20442,Get it while it's hot <3
20443,gud gam
20444,Best game of all time fr
20445,An absolute classic in its own right. Playing with friends or alone is a complete blast.
20446,https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/284842219263754254/514603769305235485/1542651032916.png?width=430&height=495
20447,A great little fun game
20448,A very fun game. Didn't unlocked all characters yet.
20449,"one of the best games to play with friends, so much fun"
20450,"Nothing exists more funny, creative, or amazing than Castle Crashers. This game has very classy gameplay, a beat-em-up style like the good old days like Streets of Rage 2. A simple plot as saving 4 princesses from (not really) another castle and a little plot twist when you save one while playing with other people online or locally. Multiple weapons, and a little thing called Animal Orbs, multiple characters to play as with their own abilities, and multiple bosses who have their own sense of humor. Not to mention that if you have BattleBlock Theater, you can play as a Castle Crasher (I call them that) and you can play as Hatty Hattington in Castle Crashers. So buy the game, if not then I don't care. Get outta here."
20451,"I first played this game on my Xbox 360 with my family. Ever since then, it has been a favorite of mine. It's a really enjoyable game, especially when playing it with other people."
20452,"Tons of grindy fun. To many, the repetitive music and repetitive gameplay and such can be cause for them to turn down this game, but its still got its fun elements. And there is strategy to it, too. What weapon, pet and character you choose and what skills you upgrade can make a serious difference."
20453,Best Game Ever Invented
20454,"This game is honestly the best party game besides Mario Party 8 that I have ever played with a group of friends. The fine tuned fighting mechanics are incomprehensible for they are so good. My friends and I have played through the story about 5 times. THAT'S HOW GOOD IT IS. We are still playing the game to this day, the replayability of the game makes it such a worth it buy. A 15 dollar price tag is justifiable, it will provide with hours of fun. I recommend this game for everyone of all ages."
20455,"I like the game, but i want more story mode"
20456,I love this graphics style! Nice and funny! The story is fun too! Very attractive gameplay.
20457,Fun couch co-op
20458,Fun game!
20459,Ok Retard
20460,what if people want the original version and they start hating on this game???
20461,"I remember playing this on my brothers xbox a good few years back and playing it again on here brings back great memories, its just as good as i remembered."
20462,Gr8 fun game to play for any age...9/10
20463,It is a fun and challenging game and it will also make you laugh a lot.
20464,based game
20465,"A fun little game in the style of old school 16 bit beat em ups, Castle Crashers is addictive and entertaining. A bit monotonous but smacking around enemies left and right is hard to get tired of, with various combos and abilities to enjoy. At the same time, you'll laugh at the whacky bosses, unique art style, and strange twists and turns the game takes, you'll fight a pirate ship full of ninjas, be abducted by aliens and be swarmed by killer doodles on an epic quest to save the princesses. I will say that the insane mode, the higher difficulty mode after the main game, goes WAY too far in how cheap and harsh it is, to the point that you have to rely on cheap tactics to try and survive. It literally feels like there was no attempt to balance it or anything, the developer's just multiplied enemy health and damage by 10 and let it be. One boss in particular was absolutely impossible for me to beat for the longest time because I end up getting swarmed and killed in seconds. But I only played insane mode to unlock one of the characters so no need to try it if you're not up to that kind of thing. Still a lot of fun"
20466,Fun button masher to play with some friends. Had some good laughs dueling over princesses This game gets my 48 Banginz seal of approval 8/10
20467,its ok
20468,great
20469,sex
20470,YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAAAYAYAYAY
20471,The classic. So good.
20472,"It's okay, i guess."
20473,"This game is fun to play alone, but is most fun to play Co-Op with up to four friends. The game is fairly linear with a lot of fighting and button mashing. The game has a variety of weapons to use as well as magic that you can utilize. The game has a cartoony look to it that also has a lot of cute, comical aspects like Animal Orbs. There is a variety of enemies and bosses that makes this game interesting, funny, and competitive when you have to fight your friends after defeating a boss. My friend and I played this game and beat it in 6 hours non-stop and it was extremely fun. Overall, this game is extremely fun if you like playing button mashing fighting games that are medieval with a linear story."
20474,[b] IT'S A GREAT GAME!! [/b] It's very funny with good story! What are you waiting? [b] BUY IT![/b]
20475,Ye it's pretty good.
20476,"Bland, your constantly fighting against the same enemy just reskinned. These basic enemies also are sponges, takes forever to kill one. when u have a bunch after you, you will get hit since you can't cancel attacks to defend yourself from the many bombs or arrows they shoot at you. The combos that u learn as you go through out aren't even that neat or to different, and even then good luck doing these combos, you'll just get hit by a projectile anyways. 

Every level just feels the same just like the enemies it just feels reskinned, fight a whole bunch of the same enemies and then boss, repeat. Also its easy to lose yourself, like seriously everything just blends in together when there are numerous enemies on the screen. The game overall just feels like a repetitive grind."
20477,"This is one of the best beat em' ups of all time. I used to play this game on Xbox 360 and almost unlocked all of the achievements. Now, if you look at the achievemnts, you would see that is a very daunting task. That is how much I love this game. Bashing and Slashing a seemly endless array of enemies and bosses keeps the game interesting every step of the way. You might need to play the game..........""many times"" to unlock all the characters, but once you played the game once, playing it over and over will not seem annoying anymore. every knight is different and each has a different elemental ability (which you can see at the title screen) which keeps every starting character interesting. Every unlockable character has a unique magic ability, ranging from arrows to bones. This is a truly amazing cast of characters. AND even BETTER is ""Lock-on Techology"" that developers do not really use that often in modern games. If you bought and downloaded ""Battleblock Theater"" and ""Alien Hominid HD"", you can unlock the main characters from their respecting games (Hatty in Battleblock and the Alien from AIien Homind) The last time  I remember a game which did something like this was resident Evil Biohazard with it's demo secret coin able to be used in the main game, but even that can't even compare to this. Overall, this game is amazing, and I HIGHLY reccomend you buy it. Grant it, the online is kind of dead, but if you join ""The Behemoth"" Discord Server (invite on their website), you will find many people happy to duel or help you in your game. Have I said to much, I think so. Just...just buy the game"
20478,"This game screams simplicity, and executes it perfectly without losing any charm or fun.
The game is designed like many from ‘The Behemoth’, with a deceivingly cute design, a shameless and unapologetically charming humor, and the focus entirely on the fun of the game.
You are a knight, on a mission to save four princesses and a magic rock… that´s it. 25 characters in total, 40 weapons, a level system as simple as it can get, a wide variety of level design and enemies, and a bunch of magical abilities make this game a true joy to play through again and again (Before you judge my playtime, I had it on console before and got it a second time for pc), because you just want more!
From the kingdom to snowy wastes and a swamp to ships and even dunes, from knights to beasts and even an alien, the variety is astonishing, while the controls and concept are held simple, easy, and player friendly.
Play alone or with up to three friends, but definitely give it a try.
"
20479,"This game is very fun, i'd deffiently recommend this game, its better with friends. C:"
20480,"It's a passable game but it's not worth full price. The game's at its best when enjoyed with friends but rather bland solo. Good comedy adventure that keeps a healthy balance between ridiculousness and stoic, as far as the story goes. Wonderful art style, good music, decent brawler gameplay.

The downsides to the game are pretty glaring. First, there's a lot of unnecessary grind. While skill overcomes a lot of that, doing so is pretty tedious in that if you're not at the ""appropriate"" level, killing things turns into a slog. Add onto that that you kinda need a full stack of healing potions to progress... and that you need gold to get healing potions... and that the best way to get gold is to do a level you can already beat easily at your level w/o having to waste healing potions... and the gameplay loop Castle Crashers is going for is actually pretty dumb. As long as you're enjoying it with friends it isn't a big deal but I do find this game has a lot of terrible/bizarre design choices like that. Another annoyance is how you have to invest several hours in a character before you'll actually know if you like that character overall or not. This may seem nitpicky but there are a ton of characters to choose from and the levels never change.

Overall, nice and simple brawler to share with friends but don't go in with extremely high expectations."
20481,"I just love this game. I started playing it way back on the xBox, and I now have it on Steam. it's a fun game, by yourself or with friends. Although I'd say with friends is better."
20482,"Pros:
- Local co-op
- Cute graphics
- gameplay and combat

Neutral:
- Story (the question is, does it need one?)

Cons:
- RPG elements are very little while characters are predictable


This game is awesome BUT only when you play it with a friend.
I was on vacation with my girlfriend. The weather was bad so we had to stay in the house. I had my laptop with me including two controllers. So we played the game until we killed the final boss and got all pets and stuff. I bought the two addons which gives you two additional characters to play. I played the black knight and she of course the pink one.
While we played, we noticed that the black knight has almost no magical powers and the pink one on the other hand no physical powers. So we decided that we set the level up focus on armour and the ability which is by default stronger. We never leveled up the pet bar.
So it is clear what you have to level up using a certain character to get the best of it. I didn’t like that much because it gives you less opportunities.
The story is very thin. I mean, save the princesses and thats it. But it has a lot of very funny moments. And when you play with a friend it is even funnier."
20483,"It's one of them og games, and I love it for all it's worth. It still has great quality compared to games of today. It's still has the authenticity that it had all those years ago, and you can play it with your friends!"
20484,Castle crashers is my favorite game.
20485,"Really enjoyed the game, the only problem that I faced was that sometimes the game would freeze for a couple of seconds, an annoying problem but I got used to it.
Generally the gameplay is quite good, I like the story and well CO-OP, loved playing this game with my friends.
Overall I would definitely recommend it but only if you've got someone to play with."
20486,how to refund
20487,a really fun game would recommend to play it
20488,fun game but i encourage you play with a freined
20489,i used to play the demo on the ps3 all the time tried to beat the first boss and everytime his health would get half way the game would cut off lol... good times...
20490,Great fun to be had
20491,10/10 would max agility first again
20492,good job i guess
20493,"Fantastic game, amazing storyline. One thing that i really liked about Castle Crashers was the jump scares, the bosses were extremely scary and i wish there was a no gore option as i am extremely sensitive about virtual blood that i faint upon eye contact with it. 12/10 will play again, recommend for those who are so bored they result in a 2012 game in 2018"
20494,"Hard to control with only a keyboard, but it is fun."
20495,Best Multiplayer game you can get for $15!
20496,THIS GAME IS A MUST GET
20497,Veri gud
20498,"PLAY THIS GAME! If you like beat em ups with a little bit of RPG level up systems, get it. ""Ehhhh to expensive im gonna get Terraria instead."" Yes, you should also get Terraria, but the 15 bones is worth it! Also, this Halloween, it went on sale for 2.99. THATS FRIKKING CRAZY! Now, lets see what it has to offer

Characters! Characters are the same, except their magic types. Now, the character you like is dependent on their magic. You got Red Knight, which is lighting. You got Blue Knight, which is ice. You got Green Knight, which is poison. And you got Orange Knight, which is fire. You can get, like, 10 more people by going through the game.

Items! You have approximately 10-15 items, which all have a specific use, and you will get them throughout the game. They are either clear where to get them, or a requirement. You dont have a good taste of these in the demo, because you dont have the full game, but they are used for a multitude of things, like the horn, which allows you to progress through the game. There are only 3 other items like this, to my knowledge.

And then we have stats, which I will NOT talk about, because you got to give a bit of surprise, dont you? If you want to look at them, get the demo. So, go download it. Now. Because you wont regret it and will wait for that trial for labor day to get the whole game so that you can buy it later and play it immediately when u get it. Now, review, 9/10. Now BYEEEEEE"
20499,fucking love it
20500,I FUXXING LOVE THIS GAME !
20501,This game will lead to a lot of fun time spent with friends.
20502,Played it back when it was on the 360 for a good 100 hours. Very goofy fun game.
20503,I Died At The Tutorial Level...
20504,At the time I first played this game it gave me a sweet and original feeling. If I were completely honest it probably gave me a feeling similar to the feeling cuphead gave to other people (I never played CupHead im just asuming).
20505,incredible
20506,10/10
20507,best fighting game i've played!
20508,"Love the cartoon style, if you don't have any friends that play this game its probably not worth it but still fun. Only mild complaint is that campaign can get a little boring after an hour or so, I would recommend trying to learn all the unique combos to keep entertained"
20509,I have no friends who play this game. So i queue for a public game and find some guy just looking at me and probably face palming. we get to a betrayl level he wrecks me. i leave aprty i play game SOLO. 10/10 would play again
20510,can be best

20523,very noice game
20524,Still worth it ;)
20525,"Fantastic game. Play with friends to get the most out of it. This game along with BattleBlock Theater are great pickups. Got this for full price way back when, but during the sales it tends to go anywhere from $3-$6, worth it either way. Both the optional additional characters for $1 each are nice additions to the game--not needed, but very nice additions. I suggest at least trying it out if you are hesistant. One of the best chill-ish co-op games ever, 10/10 reccommend and doesn't take much to run it!"
20526,i would like the game for free
20527,walked through a vag
20528,"Only game other then nintendo games that give me that warm feeling. thank you. 

My favorite princess saving game.  

fond memories on the xbox360, havent played the pc one much yet but it looks like it came a long way as far as technical features.

without testing i think girl will play it, get back to you."
20529,"This game has childhood memories for me.
I truly LOVE this game and even want this game to get an update with new levels"
20530,YAY SH IT JOKES!!!!! DIS IS FUN
20531,Very funny
20532,"A classic game that reminds me of the early days of Newgrounds, and I just love it. Anyone remember Castle Crashing the Beard? That was a classic too. I still have yet to beat Castle Crashers. When I do though, it's going to be fun."
20533,Best game and of all time :)
20534,Green dude is best
20535,Castle Crashers
20536,THis is a good ass game. Fun
20537,"Really unhappy with this game. Every third start I just get a black screen and have to Alt+F4 the game and start again. Sometimes it just laggs in multyplayer and is just not playable (we googled and tried all the tips that even some devs of this game posted. The problem can be low fps, in this game, on modern gaming pcs...). Hit detection seems a bit off sometimes. And when you play it alone, oh boy it is just horrible in a few sections. Because everybody is focusing you, while you are stunlocked on the ground. So you quit the game. A few days later you try again and you see, the game did not save. You are back in the desert again and not on the alien space ship where you stopped. Really funny. Thanks game. Don't try to Alt+Tab out of the game, that may crash it and you lose lots of progress too.

If it works it is a 2D side scrolling beat em up. You are a brave knight who trys to save the 4 princesses that got kidnapped by the bad guy. There is a little bit of progress to be made, Strength, Defense, Magic and Agility can be leveled. There are weapons to collect and animal companions to find. The boss battles are fine, though some may have just to much health. Once you got the trick you just repeat it way to often. Wich I think is  a little problem of this game in many places. Some enemys are just super beefy, when you play with 4 Players in Co-Op they have even more health, to a point where it is just not funny anymore. It just takes to long to beat up one guy. Though there is much change in scenery, you go from castle, river and volcano onto a ship that takes you to the desert and you end up on an alien space ship, the games starts to get a bit old. And you have not finished it yet, but battling wave after wave of enemys gets boring. You also unlock new characters wich are according to the internet far from balanced. But my biggest concern is, that I surely do not want to play through everything again. I do not know if I even finish this game. It is not so great, lets see where it saved when I start it again. I would not recommend getting it. I got it on a sale and I think I wasted money."
20538,cool game and fun with friends
20539,Really fun to play with your friends.
20540,pretty fun to play with friends
20541,"Amazing game, great online and couch co-op."
20542,Pretty good. I probably failed exams but at least I did it in fashion
20543,"Aaaah Castle Crasher, a really fun game to play with friends."
20544,"Castle Crashers was a staple throughout my childhood, and to this day I continue to find new ways to enjoy it every time I choose to start another run. Overall, Castle Crashers is a charming, iconic little game with some serious replay value. While playing with friends does enhance the experience, the game is just as enjoyable on your own."
20545,should play with your friend
20546,many many fun
20547,It's cool.
20548,"Best fucking game i've ever played. Can't get enough of it, I'm always coming back to it."
20549,its pretty good man
20550,I have replayed this game countless of times on both Xbox and PC and it never gets old.  One of my all time favorites
20551,"Fantastic, especially as a game to play with my kids (5 & 4 yo), or let them play by themselves . Smart, funny, and engaging, but still kid friendly (enough)."
20552,it was fun but after you beat it like most games it gets dull
20553,"whoever plays this game still hmu, tryna find someone to grind wit!"
20554,This is a game i've played for a while but I feel a sequal would help and be fun but I do love this game keep on making great games!
20555,vote trump
20556,Pretty good game and u can play through it a few times but it does get repetitive. Some areas feel like u are being spammed by enemies. But the game does have some combos that u can use to effectively juggle every enemy. This paired with the stat system and the stats each weapon attributes makes the game overall enjoyable
20557,Them princess Shawtys you see? One of them is not like the other!
20558,Effing web browser game on steam. Its truely sad that this piece'a trash is on steam.
20559,i played like 10 min
20560,A really good game. Its alot of fun and i think u should get it.
20561,"I remember playing this game back in 2014 and having a blast.

When I picked it up againt to play with friends. I got nothing but annoyance.
The game doesnt run as well as I expected it to anymore and on top of that one thing breaks the game.
You cant find yourself half the time.

When playing with friends and a lot of enemies are on screen (coupled with you the background overlapping your partily)
It becomes way too easy to lose track of where you are with so many things going on and before you know it you are standing in the face of enemies getting pummeled. 

I recall this not being an issue in the past. Some posts even indicate that there was an option to display playernames permanently in game (the 2 posts I could find, the others not relating at all to my problem at hand). So It baffles me if it was removed.

On one hand the game is quite fun but it is held back by this one element that ruins it. Keeping track of your own character is difficult as all hell and downright breaks the fun of the game. I might be able to mess with an ini file somewhere but that really shouldnt be required of me. That should just be a feature in the game."
20562,"I played this I think for around 3-500 hours back on Xbox 360. I unlocked everything, and lvl'd up most characters. I usually don't by a second copy of any game, but for some reason I just had to play it again. 

Everything you need for a great 4 player co-op is there mixed with some basic RPG stats. Throw in some crazy weapons, a pet feature and comically epic boss battles and you have Castle Crashers!

I so wish Behemoth would come out with a sequel, but this is good enough as it is. They added some extra stuff for PC I haven't checked out yet, but I'm sure it's great. 

Highly recommend!"
20563,this game is fucking great and the reason i have many of the friends i have today so thanks behemoth <3
20564,it's castle crashers HD
20565,Интересаня игра если пройти ее первый раз. А так интереснее на хардмоде ее проходить.
20566,"Fun game. Story is a bit weird, but the game mechanics are great. I recommend playing this game with a controller tho. #69"
20567,"I think that Castle Crashers could be very well the starting point of modern era coop games on PC.

Sure, we had quite few of them along the line, but one could argue, that they were hardly of the CC popularity.

And no wonder, as this one provides solid gameplay accompanied by the colourful, cartoony graphics. It is also possibly one of the best titles that can be recommended for people new to this genre or gaming in general. I'm honestly surprised, that we have yet to see follow up to the series, or even story DLC for it. I guess that kind of thing wasn't so popular 6 years ago.

Yeah, you should already have it."
20568,I personally love this game and its toilet humor.
20569,"From its humble roots as a Newgrounds flash game comes the spawn of Tom Fulp  and Dan Paladin: [i]Castle Crashers[/i].  This co-op platformer/beat-em-up has become iconic in both style and substance serving as the standard for what a fun time with friends should be like.  With a wide assortment of characters and fun abilities to increase replayability; [i]Castle Crashers[/i] stands as a testament of the love people have for simple, small, and fun indie games."

20572,"This game is really fun and has a lot of content. 10/10
"
20573,"I totally recommend this game. Plenty of gameplay with a variety of different characters, along with a multiplayer section! Great game 11/10 will play again."
20574,damn cuh
20575,"Great game, made my childhood complete!"
20576,"Great game to play with your friends if you just wanna do some casual co-op gaming, fun to play, easy controls, and also some funny parts that WILL make you laugh, no question."
20577,"One of the first game's ive ever played, still as great as the first time i've played it. Never gets old you can enjoy it by yourself but when you play with other people the fun truly begins. I would always recommend this game to anyone I know and strongly believe you should get it too."
20578,"Lets go crash some castles. Seriously though, this game is so much fun, take control of up to like 26 Knights with different abilities, play with friends or go the journey alone. Save the princesses or fight your friends to the death for your favourite princess."
20579,the game's sound cannot use my TV as out put
20580,this game was worth the price but only fun on multiplayer
20581,very good game i like like made me cume in 23.67 nanoseconds

20583,Falwless actions. Quality artstyle. Bunch of barbarians. Knights. Best game ever.
20584,Bob approved software.
20585,It's worth your money
20586,"A pretty fun game that is more enjoyable when played with friends, it also helps with defeating bosses quick if everyone know what to do but gets quite intense when you have to fight for the princess. It's still enjoyable in single player but can get quite difficult if you get hit by arrows or magic alot or get thrown by buff people. Either way you play it you'll have a fun experience playing through the game and finding and unlocking the many secrets it has
"
20587,funny deer poo poo
20588,"Really nice game. Some parts are funny, but sometimes, it gets you a bit angry :D You can invite up to 4 friends and play local multiplayer. But single player is also possible. There is always something to do: finish the game, unlock all characters, weapons... I recomend to play this game with controller on TV (Steam Link maybe...)."
20589,It's fun
20590,"neat.

20591,Best of new grounds

20594,Castle Crashers is a game where you run around and beat the crap out of things.
20595,One of the best games today.

20602,AMONG US AMONG US AMONG US AMONG US AMONG US AMONG US AMONG US
20603,"This game is a total blast. Playing with your friends is the one of the best things about this game. It can get a little messy here and there with all of the characters on your screen, but if your friends are cooperative and just wanna have fun, then good times await. Without friends this game can prove to be suprisingly challenging. I have done the normal playthrough by myself and the insane mode with one friend. This game at its core, is a Run and gun and Boss Run. Its like cuphead but just came out earlier and a little more run and gun sections. Now, I have played for about 39 hours(at time of review) and can say that I have not had any bugs or issues with the game, and this is coming from someone who is playing this on a mac. The depth perception can at times really through you off, in particular the (MINOR SPOILER WARNING) Cyclops boss. With its main dagger smash move being very unpredictable with the hit boxes. If you are thinking about getting this game, a contrller would really help. Although it's not impossible to beat this game on a keyboard (as I did), but it is really difficult. Re-maping keys is the only way to play it on the keyboard. I use and recomend, WASD for movement, 1 and 2 to cycle through equipment, LShift for sheild block, Space for jump, Mouse 1 for heavy attack, Mouse 2 for light attack. My mouse has 2 side buttons that I use as well. Button 4 is to activate magic and Button 5 is to use an item. Keep in mind that you do not have to use the bindings that I did, but I found that this was the best for me. 

This game has a lot of meat on it's bones. There are 2 ways to play the game. 1 is on the normal difficulty, challenging to try alone, but fun with friends. 2nd is Insane mode. This mode is not for the faint of heart. keep in mind you have to beat the normal campain to unlock the insane mode. I tried beating it by myself and found it to be impossible. If you want to play it alone then go a head, but fair warning, you will die and get upset, A LOT. With friends this mode is still very difficult, but can be overcome. One new added game mode feature I personally do not like is the Back of Barbarian. Although I get why they made the controls a lot different for the uniqe style, but I could just never find myself getting use to it. The arena is a typical arena, you can fight your friends to see which one of you is the best, but other than that, you probably wont come back to visit this.

Overall I would give this game a respectable 9/10. This is a really fun game either by yourself or with friends, but you will find some issues with the hit boxes because of the 2D style. If you are knew to games like this, well then you will have a great time with this. It is challenging but not to challenging. But to rap this up, I really recomend this game. 
"
20604,Probably one of the best games I own. The gameplay is entertaining and funny. The bosses can be quite difficult to beat first try but after retrying them with a different tactic it gets easy. I found myself often running out of health potions and having to careful shoot magic bolts from a distance for ten minutes to progress through a stage. Still grinding the game to get all the animal orbs and weapons. Love playing it every time I go back to the stages.
20605,"A rather silly beat-em-up sidescrolling game with RPG elements and co-op. Coins get rather grindy since the drop rate for them is low but you have the ability to replay boss battles to earn lots. The final levels are also difficult if you haven't leveled up your character much. Speaking of characters, each of them possess different abilities/spells that they can use that corresponds to the weakness of each enemy. Plot is straightforward ''rescue the princess'' but with a twist."
20606,good shit
20607,"One of the best of all time co-op games in my books. It catches the magic of playing old side-scrolling beat-em-up arcade games for quarters with your friends. Ironically this game has aged better thanks to its flash art style. If you want a game to play with your friends online or on the couch, get this."
20608,"i love your game it is so active and awsome
"
20609,Good game
20610,Finished this game with friends and i highly recommend it to play with your friends
20611,My friend bought me this game and for some reason it randomly refunded it and he never got money back soo yeah.....
20612,it very good
20613,"It's really fun to play this game with a friend or four people but don't play it alone because then it's quite boring (for me at least)

Combat is meh but the visuals are funny and cartoonish"
20614,"very nice game !
buy it !




"
20615,Game sux
20616,I have played this game for about 4 years and is still one of my favorite games.
20617,"Some things that I really liked about this game is the extensive amount of gameplay because you can go around unlocking all of the pets and weapons or you can go around and beat the story mode with all of the characters all the while unlocking more.  Another thing about this game is that the end of the story mode is not the end of the game and there is plenty to do in online multiplayer as well.  Some things that I must say I disliked about the game is that when fighting if there was another pet there it would get picked up just because I was fighting near it.  Another thing about this game is that for me this game is hard to play all at once and it was better if I did the levels in chunks with breaks in between. (That might just be me though)
Overall this is an extrodinary game and I really recomend it."
20618,Great game for singleplayer AND multiplayer!
20619,ra
20620,A true classic!
20621,"What can i say, this is one of the greatest games ever made. 100%"
20622,yes
20623,"What can I say, a classic multiplayer that still runs true. I have honestly never beat  it, but I always find it fun to start up with friends when we are in a rut for what game to play! maybe not worth full price, but worth it on sale!"
20624,"This is a really fun and challenging game.I know its expensive but if you ever get the money buy this game!!!
"
20625,It Is A Amazing Game It Is The Best Buy It Or dont But Buy it if you whis
20626,"One of the best games ever, I love it. However, an annoying bug that makes me see my desktop happens every 5-10 minutes which kinda makes it a little...annoying."
20627,What a classic?
20628,this is a good game.
20629,Its not as fun as it was
20630,its really good I beat it in like 5 hours with a friend
20631,it s so fun and you can never get bored
20632,"Honestly, an amazing game for it's age filled with crazy stuff from the developers and classic gameplay.
Much more fun to play with more people, and theres a bunch of grinding and unlockables you can get in the game.
Various unique characters to unlock, and was fun playing until the end.

Every scene and level of the game doesn't feel repetitive at all and I loved it.

You'll rarely find anyone playing this online, and it's more fun to play with someone, so buy the game when it's on sale if you know anyone who plays it.

Pretty fun.
"
20633,"[b][Achievement Review for Achievements Hunters][/b]

Fun game for those Hunters who enjoy hunting as a team, since many of this achievements will require help from another player to get them, so if you are a lone Hunter, I recommend you stay away from this game.

You will spend in completing it approximately 20 hours, his achievements are the great majority easy and has a couple of farming achievements but they are not so terrible, collect all the animal orbs, you will need to farm money and the most tedious of all achievements is ""Arena Master"", you will have to win 40 arena online matches, today is almost impossible to found someone online so you will have to ask another Hunter to help you.

[b]Summary:
Difficulty: 2 / 5
Fun to Complete: 3 / 5
Time to Complete: 20 Hours[/b]

20638,"I LOVE castle crashers, I played it when I was really young and now that it was on computer me and my friend decided to get it and it was the best purchase ever, Granted its a semi short game and you could beat it in one day, its cheap and fun. Its much better to play with two or more players, it makes it easier to beat but if you want a real challenge, play solo. If you want a game that is fun has combat and a skill gaining experience, then play it!"

20669," 100% recommend this game. I originally bought because of nostalgia (I used to play it a lot on my friend's Xbox 360), but actually still enjoy it a lot. Plus, I literally got it working on my laptop. You can run it on a potato, even if there's no space left on it. Overall amazing game, that I will continue to play for plenty of time"

20679,good game
20680,"A classic, a true masterpiece."
20681,"I love playing this game with my son. He doens't have to read things to understand, the humour is quite childish and he likes that. The game is mainly a button mashing affair. We've played it through several times now. The ""hard"" mode is much harder which is ok once you've levelled up a bit. There is a huge difference between level 1 and level 50 which means that when playing multiplayer, it is diffuclt to mix a new character and existing ones. I didn't bother with the DLC, you can get the weapons etc. playing online with someone who has just by touching them.

All in all, little thought required to play a fun multiplayer game. I would recommend if you go in not expecting much."
20682,"cool, cool"
20683,This game is very nice i like it.
20684,kino
20685,I will always love Castle Crashers!
20686,Good game and i really enjoyed it with my friend. But it's too short it only took us like 10-11 hours to beat it but still u should play it with your friends just for those 11 hours of fun.
20687,"Fun Co-Op Couch Game.

20693,This is a great game but I prefer battle block theater I got the can't stop laughing bundle and I must say that if you art in a hurry get this on sale in the summer sale I got the bundle for 7$ great game with friends (if you have them) but the solo player can get boring and I found a little challenging.

[h1]Positives [+] :[/h1] [list]

[*]This game has a replay value, even though there's nothing changed every time you play, that's how good it is, I always come back to this game.
[*]The amount of characters you can unlock on this game are alot, and they all have their strengths and weaknesses.
[*]I love it how when you are playing co-op, you are helping each other, but when you save a princess, you fight each other to the death and then go kiss the princess casually, it makes it intense when you get to the battle just to win the princess.
[*]The extra gamemode is just way too good to be an extra gamemode, the Back Off Barbarian, and that's a really good bonus. [/list]

[h1]Negatives [-] : [/h1] [list]

[*]I wish you can just go straight to Insane mode without having to go to Normal mode with each character, and that's really annoying when trying to 100%.
[*]The leveling system is way too hard for you to get a single level when going for higher levels, which makes it even more frustrating when trying to 100%.
[*]Why does the Green Knight have slow melee attacks? It makes no sense, and that makes him for sure the worst character in the game to play in story and arena mode. [/list]

[b]9.5/10[/b]

The game is incredibly fun too play and even more fun with friends, it heavily rewards you when getting better, and it's too cheap when this game is on sale.

Go save the 4 princesses and crash the castles!"
20707,"One of the best coop beat-em ups of its time. 

Offering incredible character variety and one of the most captivating art styles on the indie market even to this day, this is a must buy for anyone that enjoys scrolling beat-em ups. Obviously it is recommended in coop with some friends, however, it retains a lot of its most fun qualities solo as well, as you proceed to level up your characters of choice and play through the game as many times as you please. Not to mention, most important of all, the game is FUN."
20708,This game is pretty fun and has a lot of replay value but is most fun to play with friends though there is online multiplayer not many people use it so you'll have to set something up via the castle crashers disscusion board or get some friend to play with you
20709,"I want more!! Please relase Castle Crashers 2-3-4-5... and take my money! Great couch party game, great co-op! Thank you Behemoth guys!"
20710,"Castle crashers is a great game but it’s no fun solo player and only one of my other 
Friends play it. So if your gonna buy it make sure your other 
Friends will play with you. Otherwise it’s a great game"
20711,This game is alright the first go around but once you beat it theres really no replay ablilaty.
20712,best story game ive playd
20713,Nostalgia too much nostalgia
20714,"Bosses with health pools that require 20 minutes of button mashing to kill. What a brilliant and professional game idea.

Not."

20717,This game requires a good pc which I dont have but this is a good game.
20718,"Great game! but if only you had allowed the PS4 controller to be available to use.

Considering I did first play this on PS3."
20719,still pretty fun in 2018
20720,good game
20721,Can be played for less than 24 hours but still enjoyable to play with friends
20722,Not a really serious game. Recommended if you are bored playing the usual multiplayer games with friends and wanna try something that feels casual.
20723,"This has been and will always be one of the greatest games I still play.  I've played this game countless hours on various systems, and have enjoyed every moment.  Do yourself a favor. even if you don't have buds to play it with, just get this game and support a wonderful games company and have fun while doing it."
20724,"Worst online multiplayer ever!!! This game is a lot of fun offline coop. But online multiplayer is the worst. Sometimes a lot of lag, sometimes the fourth player cant play. Cant change between keyboard an joystick in-game."
20725,"Castle Crashers is a side-scroller even for people who don't care for side-scrollers. The graphics are charming, the levels are entertaining, and insane mode along with character unlocks add plenty of replayability. The only cons for me are the number of practically useless weapons (arguably characters and animal orbs, too), and the way in which only a minority of the total levels actually counts toward game completion. Overall, though, you will love this game."
20726,UwU
20727,"This game is easily the best purchase I have ever made, it is a load of fun with friends but still challenging and strategic at the same time. It may get a bit boring after a while but their are so many characters with customs weapons and magic which keep you easily entertained. I LOVE THIS GAME. 10/10 one of the best games i have played, the graphics may not be great and the 2d is a bit wierd at first but once you get used to it its great. Although there may not be much replay-ibility, after awhile when i get bored i use cheat enginge to make some crazy OP characters. 

Overall this will be the best 15 dollar game you will ever spend your money on! :D Great game wish there would be a seqeul."

20735,"This is by far one of the best games I have ever played. I played so much of this on the PS3 and it was AMAZING. The graphics were nice and cartoon like, almost like a painting. The action was fun and the large cast of heros by making you replay the game over and over again till you remember the amount of damage each weapon does, and knowing when a boss will make a certain move 30 seconds before they do it. But when you get all the heros and weapons and pets it feels SO good! I have yet to do it on the PC but soon I will! While the Insane mode is a bit hard (duh) I do feel like they could of made the enemies harder in a way that wasn't just making their health and damage go up times ten, it still is fun and makes for a challenge but in the end we are all screaming at the Theifs for spamming their arrows and the Fencers spamming their bombs. 

In conclusion this is an amazing game for people who love beat'em ups and collecting things. The replay abilty, why it can get a little boring, is through the roof! Every boss makes you tense a little even if it is just a giant stock of corn. I love the music, the graphics, the whole game is amazing and I will never stop playing. I would for sure buy a sequal if it ever came out. It is much worth the $15 and heck, why not just spend two more on two extra heros?"
20736,"Played it with a friend back in the day.
Had fun with it but didn´t think about getting the 100% at all

If you have the chance to play it with others then do it because it´s a very fun experience.
I guess playing solo is also okay
Maybe a 5/10 for me"
20737,"The style of gameplay gets old pretty quickly. If you're going to buy, definitely buy on sale."
20738,"If you have kids and are a mom or dad who enjoys playing games this is the king of all multi player games for a family. My sons 5 and 7 played this all the way through with me and had an amazing time. my 5 year old loves it so much that he still watches play thrus of it on youtube and asks to play 2 players with me as a reward for finishing his homework. its truly a wonderful experience to play with my sons and has lead to a ton of laughter, high fives and best of all, great memories that are extremely dear to me and will be remembered by both myself and my kids for years to come. Im not exactly sure who made this game but I cant thank you enough for all the happy times it has brought to my kids and I. I wil cherish our time together with this game for ages."
20739,"what happened to All You Can Quaff? I liked that minigame just stuffing the characters with food, it was fun, why'd you get rid of it?"
20740,its a amazing game
20741,"I played this game on ps3 years ago, which is why i have few hours on pc, but its a great game that funny and a bit challenging, yet somehow allows for error at the same time"
20742,fun
20743,"This game is generally good,but also quite like this style of painting,that is,not many people play.Give me a good review"
20744,fuking awesome
20745,"TL;DR: A fun little game that will most likely leave your thumbs aching! Probably the go-to game to play with friends. Cathartic gameplay and fun little details to find. Challenging but rewarding. 


Objective:

Castle Crashers is a brawler style game that supports up to four players. You must battle your way across multiple differing levels to save a princess in each world. You can equip different weapons and different animal ""helpers"" which have differing effects to help you in battle. 

Subjective:

This is a fun little game to while away a few hours with friends. There is enough to unlock to keep you interested and feeling like you are progressing bit by bit. There are plenty of things to see and some funny moments! Playing this with a friend who hasn't played this is a great idea! The art style is colourful, fun and interesting. All in all this is a really fun little game. It's no massive sprawling epic adventure, but it never set out to be that. Best enjoyed with friends, but you can still play this alone (might be a bit hard though!) 


Recommendation: 

Yes, absolutely! But keep in mind this isn't a massive game, it's a fun little brawler that is just long enough for a drunk night with friends with some nice unlocks to keep you interested. Worth the price in my eyes."
20746,"I've been playing this game for nearly ten years now, and it is still my favorite game of all time. I would recommend this to enyone."
20747,"why can't i smack desert people with a shovel

[h1] Castle Crashers [/h1]

+ Fairly decent music (thank god for Waterflame)

+ Good controls (at least for controllers, keyboard controls suck pipsqueak markers)

+ Tough bosses

+ Easy-ish to learn

+ DLC

+ [b] i can have a floating giraffe follow me around [/b]

+ Online, Friends Only, and Local multiplayer

+ Good graphics

+ damn Newgrounds vibes

+ Pretty fun combos

= Enemies [b] can [/b] do massive amounts of damage, but that's what potions and sandwiches are for

- Combat can get pretty repetitive and/or turn into mindless spamming at points

- getting comboed until i'm 4.5 decameters away from Toronto

- Multiple Archers. 'Nuff said.

To be honest, Castle Crashers feels a lot like Move or Die to me, for some strange reason. Probably just because of Newgrounds. Castle Crashers has quite a bit in stock and is obviously better with friends, but the main drawback is the combat, where you either slaughter everyone or get stunlocked into nothing. Other than that, pretty fun game.

7.5/10 would watch deer shart themselves again"
20748,Simply brilliant game
20749,BEST GAME EVAH!!! But But More Fun If Play Multiplayer Or coop

20760,"Pros:
- You will get a laugh while playing the game, trust me
- Wanna be a knight, a wizard or a hunter? It's your own choice
- Don't like this weapon and that weapon? No worries, plenty of them to choose
- 10 hrs playthrough (for 1 character); good playtime design for an indie casual adventure RPG
- Many characters you can choose to play
- 4 players in co-op
- Both local and online
- Make fun of me 'til very end of the game (=w=)""

Cons:
- You cannot play alone to get some achievements
- Collecting every single weapon and pet is quite tired, you need ton of coins to buy them
- Cannot play different characters on the same playthrough"
20761,"I first got this game on Xbox several years ago and liked it, but never got very far. I decided to try it again on steam and realized how much fun this game really is. It appears simple but after playing through the game several times experimenting with the level up system and different playstyles, I realized this game has quite a bit of depth. Dedicating time and effort into learning how to use magic attacks, mastering combos, and learning how to juggle enemies instead of just taking turns whacking them on the ground results in highly rewarding, skill-based gameplay. I encouraged my friends to get this game, and it functions very well as a casual game. However, there is a surprising amount of nuance that you may miss playing in a group versus singleplayer. I struggled my first time through the campaign, and it took me several days. Now, I can do it with little trouble in a few hours. I just bought both dlc's, and I'm ready to take on Insane mode."
20762,"I play this game over a 60 hours and is great 
It was for a long time my favorite game on over a time

Gameplay:it is like a classic bidimap game but better

Music:it is a fine music

graphics:I very love that

In 2 words buy it 
In 1 word masterpiece!!!"
20763,"Good with friends, ok if u want to try alone.

Never underestimate the enjoyability of this game, a well-design graphic and sense of humor during the gameplay makes the game amazing, its cheap so try it anytime!"
20764,"I have sunk so many hours playing this, it's a great cartoony game that is really good with friends."
20765,"Amazing Game, I have finished the game on the Xbox and I loved it. I went with the Fire Knight and then went all out Strength and Defense. Now I am doing another playthrough with the ice knight and I am almost completed with that one as well. As with the game that I am playing on steam right now. 

I would seriously recommend this game to anyone who is into an arcade/action game. 

Amazing Game
Great Work"

so is good

with friedns

idk


is fun


buy it on sale


ye"
20771,Very fun and crazy. I really like the cartoony style of the game and overall it is very hilarious. If you have friends (you probably do) this game has great multiplayer. It might not be very difficult but at times it can be challenging. But if you want a great challenge there is also Insane Mode. Bring some friends and crash some castles ;)
20772,Good game I like slashing.
20773,git gud
20774,nice game
20775,"i refunded it years ago. it said i had too many hours on it. don't get me wrong, its a good game. but steam took the game away and didn't give me my money back.



(EDIT): for the people that comment with troll, this really did happen. i refunded it at the 2 hour mark. i never got the money back from it, or the game."
20776,"I love this game so much it is my favorit game ever, I was so exited when I found out it was on Steam so thank you so much for having it"
20777,"this game utilizes inputs simular to a video game controller to pull of neat things.

it's a third person platformer where you hit things.

also has a story in it."
20778,this game sucks buy call of duty
20779,"this game encouraged me to stick a popsicle up my ass

10 stars"
20780,the bosses are pretty op and the game is pretty difficult on keyboard and you should only buy this if you have friends to play it with and a controller
20781,"After few minutes of playing I became quickly irritated by the 2D sytem and bosses whose purpose is run away from you as fast as they can, so it takes you at least triple time to destroy them as normal."
20782,"The game is great and it's a fun little thing you can play with some friends too if you want. PVP is dead content. There's just one MAJOR issue I find with this game. ONE of the achievements is to last 2:30 in a mini-game that isn't part of Castle Crashers game itself, it's a mini-game before joining the castle cashers game-game at the choose what you want to play page.

There's no way to actually play this game past 2:05, it is impossible to see the directions fast enough since they don't appear far enough away from you and the AI just goes without needing to see anything. Someone needs to leak a bot for this game since you can't get VAC'd on steam for using one for this game. I can't find a bot for it anywhere. I just want the achievement, I've spent around 20+ hours trying to get it and my closest has been 2:28:20.... 1.4 seconds away..﻿ 

Not to forget that you can't choose your map so you have to spend even more time cycling through them just to try again on a map with actual space to spam because there's no game play past 2:05, there just isn't. It's a game they made just to cause annoyance and then decided to add a super insane luck based achievement to the game for no reason that has nothing to do with the actual GAME but yet a mini-game they threw onto the same download. It should not be an achievement, it's not part of the actual game, it's a mini-game. They should have made collecting all the available non-DLC weapons an achievement, not this stupid mini game luck based achiev..﻿it's pointless. Just a time waste and it's not fun at all.
"
20783,"I love this game so much. The combo's you can make with characters are awesome. It's so simple to customise your character but you can make it unique.  Playing with friends enhances the experience as you can fight them after some boss fights.

Pros: 
Cartoony Style that looks really nice.
Graphics are really good.
Easy to run on most computers.
It's easy to learn the basics. But hard to master the combos.

Cons:
It's really hard to find an online match through the normal means but there's a huge community in discord with people to play with.
It gets really laggy during online multiplayer sometimes."
20784,Very fun and addicting
20785,"I have no words for how great this game is, its so much fun, i have enjoyed this game since 2015 and still enjoy to this day. 9/10 would play again"
20786,"I will first add a disclaimer that I mostly played through a free weekend thing. I had enough time to finish the story but didn't bother too much with grinding out for the rest of the game. I mean duh.... I literally didn't have that time but even once I did... I still wouldn't quite do that~

Anyways~ CC isn't a bad game at all. It's super fun and really funny and cute~ But at the current price of 15 dollars.... for fans yes do support it entirely but I personally would recommend it only if it's 50% off. It plays out more as a 7.50 dollars game and this is assuming you're the type of playing to max out and play a game until it's completely dried out with achievements... max levels... unlock everything etc. Otherwise if you're looking at it more as a fun story game... then I would even consider only buying it if it drops even lower to maybe 5 dollars.

But here's a general pros and cons list to the game~
------------
Pros~

- This game is meant to be a fun coop game with friends and that is what it really shines at. I played it with one of my close friends and it was super fun. We laughed a lot etc~ It was challenging enough that it wasn't exactly a mindless gaming session but it wasn't hard enough for us to get frustrated at all. So it's a very perfect balance for casual gaming. Stimulating enough but not too hard. But the game is super coop friendly with working with steam to invite friends etc and just having a fun time together. 4 players is the max player count.

Anyways play it with friends haha. You guys will laugh a lot and have a generally good time.

- This game can still work solo. In fact for those who are looking to max out levels and stats and unlock everything... it might be easier going solo for that and the game still works that way as well. It isn't like you need friends to do well or to beat stages etc. 

- Easy to pick up~ That's super important for a casual game. The game plays out as a regular beat them up type of arcade game haha. It's very simple to pick up on and it mostly consists of well... hitting enemies over and over and throwing in spells and arrows and items etc. 

- Super cute and funny art and story. You'll appreciate the art and stuff so enjoy that as well.

- Relatively longer replay value if you're looking to max out all achievements and unlockables and stats and levels. 

-------
Cons~

- The main story is somewhat short. I think my friend and me beat it in like.... 2 days or maybe 3...? Not the biggest issue but yeah it's a pretty short gaming session so don't expect this to be a permanent coop game you can always play with friends. It's more like a... ah let's do this game and finish it~ and then return back to other games or try other coop games etc. 

- Replay value varies depending on what type of player you are. Again for those who like maxing and obtaining everything... there are so many hours worth of grinding and stuff to do. But for players who kinda feel like me with caring mostly for the story and coop feature... once you're done with the game in 4ish or so hours... that's it.

What would've been neat is if there were more challenging coop modes added and besides just like... the extra hard mode that can be unlocked I think. But for example... an endless wave mode to work with friends on to hold out for the longest wave or a boss challenge mode of fighting all the bosses but not being able to bring hp pots and not having hp recovered after each battle and seeing how far that streak goes etc. Basically this game has the same issue Alien Swarm kinda has which is... once you're done with the campaigns and even if you bump up the difficulty itself... replayability will eventually find an end. 

Adding features that allow players to go on record beating related challenges imo would be neat and bump up replayability to basically infinity and would also encourage dedication not going to waste. Like for example... why grind to level 99 and max stats? Sure it makes the hardest mode easier by a bit but... what about after that? But by saying oh~ there's an endless wave challenge or a boss fight streak challenge... the motivation to max out for the best weapons and stats is there and there's the reward of finally putting pure skill at play for those challenges etc.

- 2d side scrolling can at times be a bit wonky hahaha~ maybe that's just me though since well... I didn't grow up playing any 2d side scrolling game. But basically sometimes you think you lined up to your enemy but you didn't.. or you thought you dodged an attack but you actually didn't. Not quite the game's fault at all since this is a 2d game and this is an issue all 2d games have not CC in specific. But~ be aware of this very minor issue if you're used to 3d or like fps games etc with more free and open movement.

-----------
Verdict~

CC is a super fun game and I don't hope the thumbs down deters people away. I just don't recommend it at its base price quite frankly.... now does that mean I want the devs to reduce it? No~ like keep it the same price. Players who really want the game.... please pay full price to help the devs. But whether I recommend it to you is based on your sense of replay value. Do you max everything out and unlock and do all achievements and still love the game to death? Pay the full price. Do you like maxing things out etc but aren't exactly looking to keep playing after you get 100%? Ah~ I'd say 7.50 is more appropriate and this is the general sale price it goes on from what I've noticed. Now someone like me who only wanted to do the story mode once with a friend? Honestly it might not be worth buying the game unless if it goes on some drastic amazing sale haha.

Anyways~ CC is a really fun coop game and it's incredibly casual. Especially if you want to play with friends and if you tend to game in more high stress/serious situations.... CC provides a really nice change of pace for once. Like it's really casual and it's just a really cute experience. But~ with the higher price.... either accept the fact that it might be a bit extra or consider it a super fair price if you're the type that will be satisfied getting extra hours out of it from maxing out and unlocking everything. 

So basically... replay value is what you need to judge. If you're like me and would rather invest your time improving at more serious multiplayer games... then CC isn't quite worth it unless if it goes on sale. Generally speaking I just can't recommend it due to its higher price and how I personally don't think it has much replay value because there is no endless mode or some streak type of coop challenge that would make maxing out everything worthwhile. Add in a boss challenge fight streak or an endless horde holdout and I would definitely recommend it as the game gains infinite replay value but as of now... there will be a dead end and I don't think that dead end is worth the higher price even if it can probably stretch you out for 50+ hours grinding for max level and all weapons and achievements and characters etc.

So yeah~ buy the game based on your personal replay value to it. It's a good game but be wary of if it'll actually be worth it. 15 dollars for 4 hours and being put back on the shelf might not be that worth it imo but if you know you'll keep playing it over and over.... then yes buy it. 

Anyways I hope this helps~"
20787,nice
20788,"This game has all; Cute girls, violence, magic, aliens and steroids!
"
20789,"For what this game is and when it was made, it's great and still is today. If you haven't played it I would reccomend it. If you're looking for a more in depth review, heres some pros and cons:
Pros:
-Online Multiplayer with up to 4 people
-Options to vary combat, sort of (more info in cons)
-Melee Combos
Either based on opinion:
-Leveling
-Lots of things to collect
-Mini Games
Cons:
-Combat methods not equally viable
-Magic and Archery don't have combos
-That one escape sequence
-Beachball
-Insane mode enemies have too much health
While I had a lot of negatives listed here, I do still genuinely reccomend playing this game with friends, while not all combat methods are equally viable, playing this game for the first time is a fond memory I still have and think everyone should experience."

There are skills in which are rewarded for defeating foes. Using these skills allow you to progress you through your quest, making it easier. If you decide to not use your skill points then prepare for hard battles. Especially against bosses.

Upon defeating a boss you typically save one of the four princesses. IF in a multiplayer game and you defeat a boss you then battle to the death to see who is the most heroic.

There are also Animal Orbs you can collect each of which having their own unique ability. 

Overall i rate this game a 9/10. Definitely worth the price for what it's currently at.
It's fun, there's multiplay, and there's collectibles!"

really fun game to play

""Castle Crashers and Chill"""

20803,Fun little sword beat em up game.  If only I could save the princess in multiplayer mode but I'm always out knighted.
20804,I would say a very fun game but requires many hours to unlock different characters

I don't have any friends."

20807,Boring
20808,Its Amazing I Recommendt his game 100%
20809,"Loved the cartoony animation and playstyle. I botton smashed a lot in this game and I laughed my way to the end. Its a easy to learn, hard to master game. Even with its simlicity, it s surprisingly entertaining. A break from all those long and focused needed games."
20810,this is better then roblox that means a lot
20811,"Funny Coop up to 4 Players. 
Sitting with 3 friends in front of a TV or PC? You like crazy humor? 
Then have fun and ""shit"" yourself."
20812,"This game has quite the replay value. If you like leveling up and choosing what stat you want most or just a good balance of stats then you'll like this game for giving you that choice. If that isn't enough there are a ton of characters to unlock, and most of them have their own unique powers. I would recommend this game if you just are looing for a new game but I would highly recommend it if you play with friends frequently because you can have a blast on this."

20818,"What a great little game. Gets a little trivial though. 
Needs DLC packages with actual game content and not just new skins"
20819,"This game was incredibly underwhelming. Theres some ""creativity"" with enemies and bosses, but its completely overshadowed by the incredibly repetitive gameplay. Also, as a sidenote, even though there are various skills such as magic that you can level up, the game will absolutely punish you and make the game unplayable should you decide to play a magic character. Even a balanced magic character is absolutely no match for 99% of the enemies in this game. Maybe worth 8$, definitely not 15."
20820,"lot of fun to play character, sword & magic fantasy, smooth actions, some skill required

20824,"In the beginning it was a really fun game to play, especially in co-op, but after a point it got very tiring and repetitive, but then it became fun again. Definitely play this in co-op, especially couch co-op, it's even more fun that way."

20835,this game has shaped me into the person i am by providing me many hours of fun (on xbox360). I am pleased to see that the updated version is very good.
20836,who doesnt have this game?
20837,I received this game as a gift and thank god I did not waste my money. I think that the games 2d style was not used effectivly in this game alot of bosses block your veiw of the character and make it hard to react to the multiple threats coming at you. While playing wiht multiple people could make the expoerience better I think that over all the gameplay is not the best and becomes annoying after playing around a half hour.
20838,"I've had this game for 8 years, it's still a masterpiece. It's also only $14.99 that's a masterpiece for your wallet."
20839,"Fantastic game, played it for months on my PS3."
20840,H
20841,I played 30+ hours and I didn't crash any castle! False advertisment if you ask me!
20842,"Very cartoony! I love the art style, as well as the mechanics of each playable character.
This is a 10 hour game if you just play the story, but if you play as each character and discover their abilities, you can make that number explode.

20843,Really cool!
20844,This game was great when it first came out. But the community has died off. Still a great game to kill time with your friends.

20846,"15.7.2018. Game #58

Fun fact: I’m writing this review shortly after the final match of Fifa World Championship 2018 and Croatia just lost to France. I really don’t give a damn about football but it’s just funny to point this out. On with the review…

[h1] When you just want to crash something... [/h1]

When you are feeling stressed and need a colorful, fun and a dumb way to kill time you look for something very simple that you can play for a while. Castle Crashers looks like such a game and certainly feels like it but it can be so much more if you let it.

This is another game I played on my Xbox 360 back in the day and I was a little reluctant to revisit it thinking that, since I didn’t like Battleblock Theater that much, I wouldn’t like this one either. Well, luckily, I am happy to report that I had nothing but fun re-playing this cute little game made of pure love.

[h1] A modernized beat-em-up [/h1]

Castle Crashers is a beat-em-up game similar to the old Sega Mega Drive and Super Nintendo games from the nineties. It takes all the best elements of those games and adds a bit of modern flare to make it feel nostalgic, yet new and exciting.
Let me just say this right now, if you miss the old beat-em-up games like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Golden Axe https://store.steampowered.com/app/34276/Golden_Axe/, Streets of Rage https://store.steampowered.com/app/71164/Streets_of_Rage/, Final Fight… you cannot go wrong with Castle Crashers. Truthfully I wasn’t that big of a fan of beat-em-ups but I really fell in love with Castle Crashers. 

Just like all beat-em-up games, Castle Crashers doesn’t really have an epic story. In a kingdom somewhere far away, an evil wizard appears, tears down your kingdom’s castle and kidnaps the three princesses. As one of the knights you set out on a journey to retrieve the princesses and defeat the evil wizard while killing any bad guy along the way. 

The game is played from a 2D perspective, as is traditional with these types of games, where you move your character from the left edge of the screen towards the right. While moving from one end to the other is all well and good, it’s what you do between that movement that matters, and that is: beating the heck out of everyone. You will fight a bunch of different enemies, including: pirates, bandits, skeletons, ice people, vampires, frogs, bats, aliens and so many more. Every other level you get a boss fight too, which are a bit more difficult than regular enemies but never too hard. 

[h1] Lots of quality of life improvements over older beat-em-up games [/h1]

If you ever die in the game you have to restart that level again. Normally, this would be frustrating but seeing how your characters level up and get stronger and how you can replenish your boosts an items, I never felt frustrated after dying. 
Every character in the game has a light attack, a heavy attack, a block, a run, and a magic attack. It is up to you to decide what works best. After defeating enough enemies, characters can also level up and earn combos and status boosts. Characters can also carry boosts and power-ups with them to assist them in those touch situations.

[h1] Really creative and funny at times [/h1]

The levels you visit are extremely creative. You will fight on pretty much every single stereotypical fantasy location such as: a desert, the frozen wasters, a graveyard, a magic castle; and on some goofy locations as well such as: an alien ship or a forest full of animals that have diarrhea. 

Did I mention that this game can be very funny at times? While none of the characters really talk and there really isn’t any written dialogue whatsoever, this game still managed to make me smile. From the way how enemies die, to all the pop-cultural references, Castle Crashers is very humorous. 

[h1] The most epic into theme ever. The graphics look kid-friendly but the game it self mightnot be suited for little kids [/h1]

The music, oh my God, the music. The game has an overly Epic theme and a bunch of adrenalin pumping tunes that really put you in the mood for killing enemies. However, the game’s cartoony graphics quickly kill all the seriousness of the tunes and but leave you with a bright smile on your face. The game uses extremely colorful, simple cartoony graphics which makes the game look like a kid’s game. With that said, it isn’t uncommon to see cartoon decapitations, brightly colored blood and gore in general. So keep that in mind if you want your little brother or sister to play this game with you.

[h1] 4 player co-op anyone? One copy of the game is all you need (and some controllers)[/h1]

Oh, yeah, did I mention this game has up to 4 player co-op? Both local and online too? Yup, and naturally, the more people you have with you, the better. Not just for the main game, but there is also an arena mode and a bunch of mini-games as well. Oh, and if you ever max out your characters status, don’t worry, you’ll unlock a bunch of other characters along the way and you can use them to start a fresh new game.

[h1] Much better than I was expecting from a beat-em-up game [/h1]

I’m actually surprised how much I have to praise about this game. Castle Crashers does everything a beat-em-up game is supposed to do and much more. It’s one of the best beat-em-up games I’ve ever played and its well worth your time and money.

Next game: Cave Story

20855,Yeah nah
20856,Likey
20857,nice
20858,"Muy entretenido, el hecho de convertir una historía cliché como recuperar una gema, defender un reino y salvar princesas en algo cómico y entretenido es digno de admiración, además, no conozco ningun otro juego en el que repetir la misma historia una y otra vez fuese tan divertido, si quieres progresar en cuanto a experiencia jugabilistica y rango del personaje es más recomendable jugar en solitario, pero, eventualmente jugar en solitario en modo loco se pone jodidisimo, en ese caso será mejor en multijugador, a continuación mi calificación para el juego

Jugabilidad: 10/10
Gráficos: 10/10
Banda sonora: 8/10
Coleccionables (mascotas, armas, personajes): 9/10
Historia: ...

Pues nada, me gustaría que añadieran más minijuegos, y más modos de arena en solitario, esa opción parece relleno si juegas sin amigos."
20859,This game is most enjoyable when played with friends. If you're looking for something you and your buds can stay up all night playing then this is a great choice. It can fall flat if you play alone though as grinding becomes almost mandatory and levels can get repetitive really quickly. Otherwise it's a blast.

20866,Amazing game! I have been playing this since I was 10 years old and it is amazing! I hope there is going to be a sequal released at some point.
20867,Shit's cray
20868,yes
20869,fun for four
20870,p god
20871,fun game
20872,I Feel this game is pretty good and has a lot of good aspects to it but the lack of content after the first few hours is kind of lame. The challenge to complete the main story is really low so you complete it quite quickly and after that point you really don't have much to do other than repeat the main story again. It is good for like 3 or so hours but after that there really is no point to the game. So I would not really reccomend getting unless that is all you are looking for.
20873,"Ive played since February of 2018 I love the game BUT I think personally they should give people the necromanser for free at the beginning of the game cause me and me level 83 ,99, 99, 37 can't beat the industrial castle on insane mode but I recommend the game"

20879,"Castle Crashers was a amazing game! The story was good and pretty awkward at the end, but one of my favorite things in it was Hatty Hattington, which was amazing since it came with a golden whale and a crystal sword! Another character that was cool was the blacksmith and pink knight (still don't have them =C). The Blacksmith was awesome since he could summon a frog to lick all the enemys, while Pink Knight was awesome because he could summon penguins and pink bears! Castle Crashers is still a good game and would recommend buying it no matter how old it is. =D (P.S.:I think they should add some more DLCs for PC so the game could feel more alive ;))"

20884,Castle Crashers is one of the best games ever its really fun and the DLC is fun to play as but they are not the best charactors so the game is not pay to win the best cheractors are the industrealust and the guy you get for beating the game with the industrealust to get the industrealust you have to bet the game with the blue knight its got poop jokes and its really the funnist game on steam 11/10
20885,its very rage indusing but once you get the hang of it and understand the concept it pretty fun :)
20886, A good game to play with friends. (The fact that I don't have any makes me D E P R E S S E D).
20887,"Castle Crashers is my favorite beat em' up game, hands down. I love the art style, and for being a button-masher type game, it still poses a fair challenge. On top of that, it's really fun to play with friends."
20888,Good game. Make sure to buy copies for your friends if you have any.
20889,"I absolutley love playing this game. It may be an old game, but it is still so fun and you should definitley give it a try. If you want friends to play with you can join my Castle Crashers Discord. https://discord.gg/rrmewwF"

20895,"Good for playing with friends, that is if you have any."
20896,Great game.
20897,"From what I've played so far, it's a simple, and fun beat-em up game."
20898,"A simple, yet entertaining, side-scrolling fantasy RPG, Castle Crashers has a style that hearkens back to the days of classic 8-games, but with a hand-drawn animation style.  I would strongly recommend playing with a controller, as keyboard/mouse controls are not as intuitive.  The game takes the form of quests to achieve various objectives, and your character (there are several archetypes available, each with slightly different abilities & colors) will gain XP as you fight enemies and complete objectives.  The missions usually involve waves of enemies followed by a boss fight.  There are various combos and teamwork is encouraged.  Cooperative mode makes the game engaging (for up to 4 players)."
20899,"Honestly my favorite game of all time, have bought several times on several platforms and for several friends.

12/10 would reccomend no meme."
20900,cool and good
20901,"Want to know what's common between this game, Dota2 and Monopoly?
Welp, you can either have fun af or crush your friends relationships with you

but still 11/10 would recommend this af, it's worth the money especially when you play with people you know

Pros:
Co-op with your friends
Humouristic characters and enemy animations
Practically the whole game is a laughing joke in a good way
Play this game with different friends each time and destroy their hopes and dreams
Replaying this game doesn't really get boring because of the endless different characters you can unlock throughout the game and even more when you clear the game once or twice

Cons:
Destroy your friendships as you fight for a 2D girl at the end or steal their loot"
20902,מ
20903,I can see the appeal; but unfortunately it just feels like a button-mashing grind.
20904,epic
20905,"This game is one of the greatest games I've ever played, hands down. The gameplay is solid, it handles well, and all the abilities and bosses are fun and incredibly unique. The bosses (and all other combat) feel very challenging, yet are perfectly balanced. The artstyle is fantastic; it complements the theme perfectly and is the crowning jewel of the presentation of the game as a whole. The music is beautifully composed, I honestly can't listen to it enough; it's defintiely part of what continues to draw me back to the game. The humor is brilliant, and what makes it even more impressive is that, given that none of the characters talk (save some store NPCs and a few grunts and laughs here and there), all of the humor is visual, which isn't a super easy feat. One of the best things about this game is it doesn't feel grindy at all; you play to play, not to level up.

The replay value is infinite. I played this on my Xbox 360 about 4 years ago, and got to level 50-ish as the Blue Knight; I've just bought it for the PC the other day and I've already hit level 25 (Blue Knight again) and have nearly completed the first half of the world; all that's left is the Industrial Castle. My total playtime on PC is 6 hours, btw.

Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this game, especially if you have people to play it with. It's very well worth it.

As a final thought, I would LOVE to see a Castle Crashers 2. The Behemoth has some of the most creative developers ever and I'm beyond certain that they could make an amazing sequel to this game. Even if it took another ten years, I'd be ready and waiting."
20906,played 4 dayz dard
20907,wört for 2.55€
20908,Love the game. So much fun to play with friends that I don't have.
20909,"DUN DUN DUN DON DUN DUN, DUN DUN DON DUN DON DUN DO DOOOOOOOO  DO DO DOOOOO DO DOOO DOOOOOOOOO DOOOOOOO DUMMMMMMM DOO-O-O-O-O-O-O

My favorite game I own on steam right now. Holy hell I can't say how pumped I am to have this game again. The joy of unlocking and leveling up all the characters, animal orbs, and trying to achieve all the achievements never gets old for me, no matter how many times I keep replaying this game. I have very few complaints, and none of them really affect how I feel about the game.

Pros - Solid Gameplay, fun and unique characters, creative and entertaining areas and boss fights, quircky and highly enjoyable story, design, etc., Great multiplayer game, well aged, plently of intresting gamemodes to keep you playing even after beating the game, very cheap and reasonable price for the game and dlc. 

Cons - Not many people online anymore, no added story dlc, very small imbalance of certain characters, hit boxes can be a bit difficult to hit being the 2d models, some secrets are impossible to find without video tutorial or having prior knowledge of it, limited achievements

Even with these cons, it cant stop me from giving this masterpiece a solid 10/10

Ps. Behemoth you probably wont do this but please put Alien Hominid on pc because I really wanna play that again and with friends. But if you can't I understand."

20932,"If you have a friend or friends, i highly recomend this action packed button mashing 2d fighting game with amazing soundtrack. I really love the art style but is a boring mess when playing alone as there is nothing else but mashing buttons on enemies until they die.

also do beware there are bugs that can crash the level for you.

6/10 with friends
3/10 solo"
20933,"Gameplay
The gameplay in Castle Crashers is fun at first but becomes pretty tedious, especially near the ending. It boils down to mashing buttons until your enemies are dead. There's also magic, which adds a small variety to it. I've played loads of 2D beat 'em ups, a few of them is Turtles in Time, Maximum Carnage and Streets of Rage but Castle Crasher isn't as fun as those games, as it lacks something which I can't put my finger on.

Story

It works for a 2D beat 'em up, I suppose.

Presentation

The art style reminds me a lot of old games from Newgrounds, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It looks very nice, one of the things that made me want to play it. On top of that, the soundtrack is fantastic, my favorite being from a boss in the final level.
However, the game is very buggy. The game locked up right before the clear screen once, and during a co-op session, the game would make me and my friend see completely different things onscreen, among other annoying bugs.


Summary
Castle Crashers has an appealing art-style and soundtrack, and can be fun at first. But it is far too repetitive and buggy for me to properly enjoy. It's not a bad game just repetitive, so I would recommend it if you have friends to play with for a while.

20934,"BEST 2D GAME TO PLAY SOLO OR WITH PEOPLE
"
20935,"Incredibly fun couch co-op game that you can finish in one sitting if you're dedicated enough! Once you've finished it once and unlocked a new hero, you will still to get addicted to unlocking all of them. Played it many many manyyyy hours on the original Xbox 360 version and this one is just the same. Simply amazing, a must play."

If you like stealing the princesses kisses from your friends in multiplayer... 

And if you like cartoon graphics with (cartoon) gore. Have fun!"
20939,This game was my childhood I've played ever since I could remember. This game will forever live on in my heart. I will until I am on my death bed for Castle Crashers Two.

20944,It was fun. Not many people online though.
20945,"dunno, pretty nice."
20946,"It's Castle Crashers - you know it, you love it. It's a 3D beat-em-up, focused around co-op nonsense and the zany art style of Newgrounds past.

The game is fine for what it sets off to accomplish: the gameplay is pretty solid with definite power-ups and progression over time, between the new magicks you find and weapons you loot. The enemies are mostly fair and the bosses are good. What gives the game most of its life is its artistic appeal - they have mastered a style in the making since Alien Homonid (or something, I haven't followed the studio well enough). The characters have fine personality, even in a game without many words.

The music does admirably as well. I don't love every track, but several stand out on their own. The story... well, it's a story. The game's greatest draw is the co-op: control scheme and game style perfectly suited, as well as the game's general tone of one-upmanship against both the enemies and each other.

In the end, Castle Crashers is the game you've heard lots about, and it holds up just to expectations. The art is a great draw, and the gameplay is best with plenty of friends. 8/10."

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Graphics
- RPG elements
- Smashing Co-op
- Funny Adventure
- Nice soundtrack
- Action boss fights won't let you breath
- Opportunity to choose your character and play him in your style (Tank/Fighter/Mage/Archer/Combine)

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Unoriginal story (Mario 2.0)
- No way special characters as DLC
- Low replayability (You can collect rest of pets and weapons but you don't want to play it again)
- Rare problems to start Co-op

[u]Nothing for solo riders[/u] otherwise excellent fun for a few evenings with friends.
Pro tip: Buy in discount"
20948,nice
20949,I love this game. It's so chill. I can just open the game and relax a bit with immature humor and satisfying hack and slash combat. There is very little I would improve in this game. Graphics quality could be better. And more content. But thats about it. It's very good at what it is. It's clear that the devs had s clear view of what they wanted to make. And they did a great job at it.
20950,Solid staple. Amazing. 15/10 recommend.
20951,"Turtles in Time... Four player action, with extra benefits.  It's a good time."
20952,"If you want a fast game with lots of combat moves - this is a game for you.
But if you're easily distracted by colours and have very bad hand eye coordination, stay away.
This game overall is a fun game to play - easy, chillax and fast level up."
20953,10\10 good game plus my childhood. Also the best game on steam.
20954,"Ive never had the experience to pillage a village like the mongols and was the good guy ,but finally castle crashers made that experience possible ,and now i have a child named ""wei ling"" thank you behemoth studios to recreate the life of genghis khan and all of the khan's legacy such as conquering china and almost japan."
20955,its a great game if you like playing as a knight.
20956,"While this game is good, there is one problem I have with it (and hope that it’s only me). Every single time I start this game up, it keeps erasing my data. Other than that, I recommend playing this game (especially with a controller)."
20957,good and imaginative beatemup
20958,kool
20959,This is a classic from my childhood. I can't not recommend it. One of the few games I've replayed multiple times on multiple platforms and enjoyed it every time.
20960,good
20961,A very fun mid-evil time beat em up
20962,amazing game cant stop playing it and it is extremely funny when ever i get on i always ask my friend to play this game with me because it is very addictive
20963,GG EZ WP
20964,"My thoughts on the game was... I LOVED IT. I remember getting it on Xbox 360 and have had a blast! The only thing is that the demo should be a bit longer than it is, But besides that its a very fun game."
20965,"E P I C game, good to play with friends or family. Fuck you river cat."
20966,One of my favorite games ever.
20967,"Only real men play as the Gray knight,"
20968,"Fun with friends. 
8/10 :)"
20969,"Castle Crashers is a very interesting castle seige - beatemup type game for a good time with friends, the artstyle is very good, the controls and performance is very good overall. While this game is a good time with friend's, I wouldn't 100% recommend this game, It can get old, very fast. The main story is very short, and the ""insane"" mode is essentially a harder version of the main story, however it can be fun to come back to and play every now and then."
20970,Best Game evar!
20971,"I'll be the first to admit, I'm late to the party. Mostly playing this game in the last week, 2018, it actually holds up really well to the current standards. I really liked the boss and level design, overall the art direction taken for this game is awesome, it plays really nicely (particularly with Duelshock 4 support). The difficulty does tend to, vary from time to time. The game can go from cruising through easy, to impossibly hard, usually calling for some amount of grinding to buy better equipment/ upgrade stats. 
Myself, I finished the game within 8 hours without much fussing around. A completionist could easily squeeze out a few more hours. So in conclusion, this is a really fun, really well designed, and still relevent arcade adventure game. An absolute steal when picked up during a sale."
20972,"I played this game back on the 360 and was worried that I wouldn't enjoy it as much. This game in 2018 still made me laugh out loud and my only regret in buying this, is that there still isn't a second game."
20973,"Amazing looking game, Funny, fun and Somewhat challenging when first getting into it. Also there are alot of different weapons and pets to collect which gives you a reason to keep playing it"
20974,This game was awsome on the ps3 but after hearing the remastered was only going to be on xbox I was pretty sad. But then that winter I got some steam gift cards. The winter sale was still going on so I was looking around.  Then I found it and it was better then the ps3 version.
20975,fun gAME TO PLay with friends
20976,"A great game to play with a friend or two, but honestly not really worth it outside of multiplayer. The vast majority of the appeal lies in fucking around with your friends. Still, thoroughly enjoyable if you can do MP."
20977,Nice to play with friends (co-op).
20978,IDK what you say this game is Fun
20979,hey who want to play online add me
20980,castle farters
20981,amazing ;)
20982,Fun and amazing game to play alone and with friends.
20983,"Great game. 
Would Suggest using a controller. 
I have played it on the 360 and on here. 10/10 would suggest"
20984,Fun and simple for a good price
20985,Fun
20986,"Story mode too short, beat the game in one sitting with my friend. Otherwise, Its a great game"
20987,Plataform game super easy and fun to play in coop mode. Phases and characters are cartoon-ish style and very colorful.
20988,Really old but still enjoyable
20989,Fugma Ass this is the best indie game ever
20990,"I love this game so MUCH! Its so good imo, entertaining especialy with a friend."
20991,very good would kill my friend in the arena again(if i could)
20992,"Castle Crashers is a 1 to 4 person beat'm up where you play as 1 to 4 knights trying to rescue princesses. The catch being the entire world is a cross between d&d and a really weird acid trip experienced by saturday morning kids cartoon animators.

The story doesn't matter, you are killing dudes to rescue princesses and commit mass genocide along the way.

The gameplay is your standard beat'm up affair, you have your light attacks, your heavy attacks and your special. You go from stage to stage murdering a massive collection of bosses, minions and aliens. What castle crashers does that most beat'm ups don't is have an insanely responsive and fast paced control set-up. You will be munching through enemies at the speed of sound if you get good enough with this, but at the same time, enemies will chew you up and spit you out  as well, because after a while they get unique attacks depending on their type. Their damage also increases and the AI becomes much more aggressive, to a point where you will get your butt handed to you on a silver platter.

You also get new weapons and equipment throughout the game, and each character you get your hands on has different special abilities to use. Unfortunately they all level up independently, so you'll have to grind new characters up to be useful for later levels, but that's the main source of replayability for this game, so take it how you will.

The game is visually distinctive as mentioned previously, always managing to one-up itself and keep each new level feeling fresh and interesting. Another thing to note is how they all link together, so it feels less like a series of levels and more like one giant quest to get from one end to the other. The music is good, suitably bombastic and fantastic, with a wide range of scores to suit each and every enviroment.

Overall castle crashers is a fun 4 hour romp, by far one of the best beat'm ups you'll ever find, full of character and personality. I had some fun with it despite not being a massive fan of beat'm ups myself, and i'd recommend it to someone looking to just do something fun and stupid with friends for a little while."
20993,had a good time playing this game with the free trial
20994,Awesome game to play with friends!
20995,"This game is easily one of my top 10 favorite video games of all time. Why?  Because a no brain thats never seen a controller can pick this game up with ease, and veterans can dive deep into a rich, hard to master fighting-scroller.

GRAPHICS: 9/10
This game is beautiful in its own way, the entire game is hand drawn and it gives a silly look that can't help but make you want to laugh. The backdrops are nice, the enemies are very creatively drawn and the whole game looks great.

SOUND 9/10
There is no dialogue in the game but the soundtracks are something special. Each song that plays makes you just want to boogie out. 

GAMEPLAY 9/10
The gameplay looks so simplistic at first glance which makes it easy to pick up. However the game is very deep, rich with combos and different characters that it allows for veterans to get into it.

REPLAYABILITY 9/10
There are 31 characters to play as, 10+ modes to play, and much fun to be had. This game has alot to offer.

OVERALL 9/10
This is an amazing game for 1, 2, 3, or 4 people. If you have a small group of friends and want to play a casual, funny enjoyable game I would 100% recommend this one every single time. It is an amazing experience."
20996,"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, yes"
20997,"The game is pretty good, but in all honesty I bought the game for my friend's and I didn't enjoy it too much. The gameplay gets kinda repetitive (although some people might like that) and if you fall behind it's kinda hard to catch up. Again, [u] not at all a bad game [/u], but it just wasn't for me."
20998,"Amzing game, best game of its generation! Please try!"
20999,insane mode will make you cry
21000,I really liked this game
21001,The only thing that crashes in this game is the online multiplayer
21002,Friends played this so we play I enjoy the style of the game makes me giggle and feel nostalgic from the 3D games out today
21003,"yeaaaa coolllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
"
21004,maximum fun
21005,"Pretty great game for single player.
Dev hasnt fixed the online issue that litterally makes it 100% impossible to play online yet. Its been years.
You WILL get stuck on ""Joining game"" forever. If you want to play this WITH someone, it will NOT happen."
21006,The fights are pretty repetitive. Doesn't make much fun.
21007,Quite addictive and very fun to play. Love it!
21008,Best Game Forever!!!!!
21009,This game is so funny the design the items and weapons I really like it I’m gonna unlock all the characters and I’m exited to play with my friends and just having a great time
21010,"It's a 2D sidescroller hack and slash celebrating all the things about Newgrounds in 2008. So there's plenty of crude humor, the soundtrack is pretty hit or miss, and the gameplay is pretty much on the level of ""flash game with a big budget"". Review seem short? That's pretty much the game. It's better enjoyed with friends, so if you don't have any of those or you like to fly solo, I'd say it's not worth your time. Outside of that, it's a pretty good 5+ hour experience with your friends that's worth the $5 or so it is right now."
21011,oo princes gave me a kis :flushed:
21012,"this game is more addicting than drugs and is fucking fun as hell, buy it now"
21013,"Otimo jogo, ainda mais para se jogar com amigos 
"
21014,"really fun to play with friends and by yourself 
"
21015,"WOW! so ya my friend and i were looking for a game to play together and he gifted me this, ill have to say i have never really been a fan of side scrollers but O.M.G. this game is fan-frickin-tastic! Im having so much fun with it i cant wait to play it again! Its definitly worth the money!!"
21016,"its a very good game, thats all."
21017,and old classic
21018,The keyboard controls are quite shit and it's mostly just a button spam simulator
21019,still better than battlefront 2.
21020,"Since when do I have this game.

I have never played it before."
21021,i cant really play this without a controller but i really wanted to play with a mouse :[ but i still do recommend becuse ive watched other people play
21022,"Very good and very nice, i recommend it for all, best with friends and gamepads ;)"
21023,yeah good

21026,"[h1] Castle Crashers Review [/h1]

[b] Gameplay [/b]
This game is a playful cartoon style video game with amazing detail. The base mission of the game is too save and kiss all four princesses along with taking down the baddy who kidnapped them. After you complete the normal mode their are new things unlocked like ""INSANE MODE"". In Multi-Player at the end of a boss fight containing a princesse you must prove you loyalty and fight each of you other teammates for the princesse's kiss. In Single Player at the end of a boss fight containing a princesses since there is only one of you just kiss princesse.
NOTE: It's slightly more fun in Multi-Player.

[b] My Personal Thoughts about The Game [/b]
I absolutely loved the game has left a huge impression on me. I first played the game on Xbox 360 in 2014 I hadn't played since then. That was before I knew their was "" Steam Edition"". Once I found it I scraped $14.99 in change ran to the nearest ATM and put it on to my Blue Bird card! Both single player and Multi-Player are great and very well made i would give this a 95/100. The only reason I took away five points is because some of the achievements are only obtainable trough Multi-player."
21027,"It's a great game overall, really fun when you have friends to play with. But one thing I wasn't satisfied with is the ending.
I wanted to have all the princesses to myself but I got bamboozled.
What the fuck Castle Crashers, just why, you made my day fucking horrible."
21028,"Played this to Death on 360 and its still incredible, so much silly fun and well designed boss battles"
21029,"this game it very fun to play Just slash slash and slash them all 
Recomend buy cant stop laughing pack"
21030,Fun.
21031,it's pretty good.
21032,"The game is incredibly fun, with a bunch of levels you can't get bored. The game in fun to play with friends and family, and you can find so many hidden items. I've played the game on steam, and Xbox and I've loved it ever since. Restarting was no hastle, I actually had fun restarting a game and trying it again. And even if you are to get bored, once you finish the game you get a harder mode of it, which I have to say is actually hard. This game also has a lot of things in the background which again, makes if never get old. With a bunch of things to discover and do, it is super fun. Overall I would have to recommend this game to anyone."
21033,good animations and story?
21034,"This game is my chieldhood. Played it for hours and hours on my XBOX and PS3. The gameplay is fun and easy to get used too, the artstyle is just great and the music makes me happy. Overall a 9/10."
21035,"Play it with friends, the ending of the final boss fight is worth all the money."
21036,"I recommend it for the first few hours. After a while you get sick of spamming x ( or click if you use computer) you get tired and it gets a little boring and once you have a level 92 like me its pretty boring i wish it got updates ;_; becides that its a good game i recomment it
"
21037,This game has balance issues. But other than that this is a fun game. It's got that grindy feel but isn't too grindy. This game is SO fun with friends. Definitely worth the resources.
21038,I just love these devs
21039,good
21040,this has been one of my favorite beat em ups of all time and to finally be able to play it again is just amazing
21041,Very fun to play solo and with a friend. Mostly better with a friend but it still gives a challenge playing solo. 10/10
21042,Great game!
21043,"if how much play time i put into the game isn't good enough this review is for you

this is my favorite game of all time

this game has good gameplay, good character designs, can be replayed over and over due to how many characters it has (31 or so) etc.

play it plz"
21044,"This game is just a ton of fun and was worth every penny.
"
21045,"An incredible, timeless masterpiece. This game is an instant classic."
21046,"A good story! A cute graphic with cute and funny characters and you can even ride a pooping reindeer to escape from a black thing! 
There are just 20 bosses, but they are going to give you a hard time and a lot of fun
 It is worth all monies! Fun to play with a friend!
"
21047,"Timeless classic for many people including me, playable alone or with friends, id reccomend a controller none the less.
10/10 Worth every penny and more"
21048,"I consider Castle Crashers® one of the best game on Steam.If you havent yet buy it , do it now. 11/10."
21049,"One of my favorite games of all time, i revisit this game all the time!"
21050,dank
21051,I really wnjoyed playing this game has child with my brother on our Xbox. Revisiting it was really nostalgic for me.
21052,Hilarious and fun to play with friends!
21053,This game is EPIC.
21054,very gud
21055,"pretty dank, would highly recommend this, especially since the summer sale is goin on."
21056,"Such an amazing game, highly recommened!
For less than 5$ this game is a bargain!

- Solid single player
- Very fun with friends
- True hack&slash
"
21057,best game
21058,"Really weird game, which makes it a funny game. Addictive with friends as well. 9.5/10"
21059,BOUGHT DLC FOR A INSANE AMOUNT OF 2 EUROS. DID NOT GET IT. WTF IM BROKE NOW
21060,"In all the years of owning this game. every time someone asks me ""Hey, I need a new game to play on Steam."" I always respond with Castle Crashers. Simply put, it's a call-back to the fun, arcade styled Beat-Em-Ups! with a great twist to combat with the RPG-styled progression system. Although every character functionally plays the same with their combos, there's always a feel that every character is truly different with the magic system.


tl;dr this game is bomb af and I look forward to buying it and playing it with every friend of mine who hasn't bought the game yet"
21061,"Classic. Great game, highly recommend."
21062,"I love this game and heres why


-Funny
-Story Rich
-You get extra stuff in battle block theater
And there are 


-no cons!"
21063,nice
21064,"vv fun game to play honestly, finished the whole thing i loved it"
21065,"A glorious, fun, insane brawler with a ton of replay value thanks to its multiple characters."
21066,"Ultra Mega QUantilijionbajiliodajion Awesome Epic game :). in short a great game to play both SingleP, MultyP :) one of the best gemes ever :)"
21067,game is gucci
21068,mash w the game
21069,"Poor hitboxes, bad level design, and childish humor make this a bad game."
21070,So many better games in this genre.  It also has some fairly childish humor. Go checkout Sacred Citidal
21071,"good funny but somwhat hard, good game i rate 9/10"
21072,amazing i love it i recommend it to everyone
21073,Great game
21074,Yeah its good. Best enjoyed on a couch with m8s and draw.
21075,"Great Beat em Up fun. Nice game to play through with friends, though the experience can be rather short. Best for a weekend playthrough with a buddy. HIGHLY RECOMMEND CONTROLLER"
21076,Best game for it's time. :D
21077,"Disclaimer: I played this game to death, so my views on the game may not fully reflect the experiences of someone's first time playing it.

Castle Crashers is another one of the Behemoth's silly co-op masterpieces, and it still holds up.

[H1]Pros :[/h1]
-The movement of the knights is only limited by the player's skill, you can start flying and become a tornado of death if you're good enough at the game.
-The artstyle is charming and versatile, ranging from goofy to intimidating.
-The replayability is very strong, there's 31 characters in total with mostly different magic movesets.
-Many set pieces and variety in areas
-Enemies aren't often reused outside of the levels they were introduced in
-Great bosses
-Insane mode offers a true challenge that'll destroy everyone who tries it.
-The game is best experienced with friends, but still has much to offer for someone who goes at it alone, especially with the higher difficulty.

[h1]Cons :[/h1]
-The ice king
-There's a bit of toilet humor, but it happens rarely and isn't too intrusive.
-Some enemies are a bit tanky if you're not familiar with the game's higher end combos.
-Insane mode has an extremely steep learning curve, but surmounting renders you immortal.
-A handful of the characters don't have unique magic movesets

This game is a flawed masterpiece of a beat em' up that has an extremely high skill ceiling, I reccomend it to everyone."
21078,Solid experience and game that I would honestly recommend to literally any type of gamer
21079,Game is very fun with your mates. It is a cool game and the story is interesting. Neat game overall
21080,"This game is a great beat em up style game. It is best played with friends. The game is humerous and enjoyable, but the combat is fluid and fun. There is a basic leveling system in place, but it lets you specailize how you want to create your character. Overall a great time."
21081,fun n cool. like the artstyle of it :)
21082,hola
21083,"Fun co-op game, somewhat frusturating at times. Definitely a little crude."
21084,cool
21085,"Hot heck. If you like playing games with friends, and having epic fights with the greatest fitting soundtracks to accompany it, you're going to LOVE this game! Each level is different, and the humor in this game will certainly give you a chuckle! 

Pros:
- Great humor
- Lovable soundtrack
- Enemy variation that keeps skill-based gameplay on par with spamming
- Much lower price than it should be (Especially on sales!)

Cons:
- Combat is generally the same each time around
- Spamming agility or magic can get very overpowered at times
- One of the characters, Hatty Hattington, is from a $20.00 game which can really hurt if you want to collect all of the characters
- Some characters have the exact same magic as others

I have sunken many hours into this game. The replayability and solid levelling system that is very difficult to exploit can keep you playing for hours without end! None of the achievements get too hard to do if you know what you are doing, and the animal orbs, weapons, and unlockable characters are all different in magic, appearance, and tier!
Rating: 9/10"
21086,"Honestly it's a really fun game, but it is pointless unless you have at least 2 or 3 other people to play with."
21087,fun but play with friends for best experience
21088,"Great Hack&Slash, brilliant music and art. One of the best coop games."
21089,"Spent hundereds of hours playing this on Xbox with my friends, great game"
21090,"Very fun solo or co-op. Graphics/art/style is very pleasing. Gameplay is smooth, with an entertaining story. Runs very well at max settings on my machine, which is mid-range at best. Enemy mechanics can be frustrating at times, but but death in this game is usually not much of a set-back, if at all. Highly recommended to grab a few controllers and try the game out with some friends. Well worth full-price at 15 bucks. If you catch it on sale, definitely grab it."
21091,"It is a flash game on steroids, and I grew up on flash games. Nostalgia, mixed with a solid tight control scheme, and cool mechanics are all you need to win me over! Support the devs! Buy the game, and enjoy!"
21092,*Getting flash game vibes but not really* Its actually outstanding! uwu
21093,please fix the sending copy for this game my friend just sent meit and it didn't work so fix it please
21094,Great co-op game!
21095,"it's fun, has catchy bgm and pretty funny sometimes. i like it, so you should to."
21096,"Love this game.  I can't stop playing, so fun.  Like the old arcade games but with better graphics and using a controller.  If you loved TMNT at the arcade, this is for you."
21097,i steal the money from my friends
21098,it's ok
21099,the detroit of newgrounds games
21100,"An early 2000's flash game all the way through. Perhaps it just hasn't aged well.

Comical art style that's amusing, but never really used to any great effect, just always there in the background.

Okay controls, but annoying to line up hits (flat view with no perspective combined with flying enemies means you you're always looking at the floor trying to line up shadows, instead of just enjoying the combat).

All of that is minor compared to the biggest annoyance: the gameplay. To level up, you just grind the same few stages over and over. Even within a level, it's just wave after wave of idential enemies. The gameplay does not scale well with the number of players (becoming way too hard or way too easy, depending on how many are playing). If you actually build the character you want (say, all magic), the game may later reveal some new enemey (say, immune to magic) that means your character is basically worthless, and you have to grind for another dozen hours to raise other stats.

Finished it begrudgingly. Will probably never run it again."
21101,I R8 8/8
21102,SO much fun to play with friends!
21103,"Great game, especially with friends. The game is fun and it's definitely worth playing for both its graphics and gameplay. The soundtrack is good and the game's content is great although it is a little short. It's a challenging game that doesn't require too much grinding so I'd recommend it."
21104,Great game!
21105,Very smooth and a ton of fun to play with friends.
21106,"Never have I seen a game with such mixed and balanced statistics.
The beauty of this game does not come from it's cute and gruesome art, it comes from the story and grind.
There are so many possible choices of customization and it follows up with unlockable characters.
NOT TO MENTION THE FREE DISTRIBUTION OF THE NECROMANCER, CULT MINION AND KING WITHOUT ANY DLC.
It is a great game, and I'd play it for even longer than 500 hours in one session."
21107,Good laughs and even funnier memories. Defenitely recommended for online friend groups.
21108,I tried playing this game but had no friends so it became another thing to fill my miniscule steam library.
21109,Bought this in my first steam summer sale. Amazing with friends and good by yourself. Never regretted this purchase. Also 60 fps now so yeah.
21110,An Xbox Arcade classic that's been beautifully optimized for PC. Perfect with friends.
21111,"One of the best Indie games, if not THE best."
21112,"This game is so awesome, Nice art Style, gaming Mechanics and also Pretty cool levels!

It can run on almost any PC, It ran for me :D pretty cool actaully

you should get it"
21113,"nice art work, fun gameplay"
21114,"Cute game.. Could definitely play it over and over again.. Always fun with friends.. I can't get one achievement and it's really pissing me off LOL.. But apart from that, really do enjoy playing this and come back to it quite often with different people.."
21115,:)
21116,"Just got a trading card for this game, not played it once. Good."
21117,"
The Behemoth is the A24 of the game buisness. Its incredible and radicle art style makes you appricate all the little detail put into the game. 10/10."
21118,I played this game with a bunch of friends while it was free during the cleaning event and it was a ton of fun it was the main game we played and when we couldn't play it anymore we agreed to get this game and finish our playthrough. I recommend anyone to try this game out it is REALLY fun.
21119,...
21120,top
21121,PLEASE PUT IT FREE:(
21122,"A four player beat 'em up with a story shorter than a grown man that's 4ft.
Replay value exists with the game rewarding you for doing so, which is nice, because if you wanted to speedrun this game solo, it'd take 4 hours roughly (I did a solo run to make sure), meanwhile with a friend you can do it in 30 minutes.

The game also has a ""hard mode"" that is pretty hard, so get your 3 other friends and have fun with this 'one of many' old treasures Behemoth has to offer."
21123,Great to play with a couple of friends or even with kids...
21124,"Played it on the free weekend, it is quite a fun game! I give it a 8/10, very well done!"
21125,"fun game to play with your friends once in a while, the biggest problem is that leveling as melee is hard because of the experience system"
21126,mad
21127,crash the castles
21128,"even tho i've only played 10 hours, it's a great game very entertaining. Recommended"
21129,.
21130,"Good Game good fun, But why the helll is the Cyclops boss so hard in insane like two hits kill with almost max defense like flippy -a-roonie, other than that overall good game"
21131,"pretty mindless gameplay but lots of great memorable characters and art. co-op highly reccomended,"
21132,: D
21133,"Castle Crashers is one of my absolute favorite Beat'em Up games. This game is a classic straight off of the Xbox arcade alongside its puzzle game brother: Battleblock Theater.

Castle Crashers has a wide array of characters to unlock which gives it replayability and keeps you invested to see how the new character plays. My playtime on steam is quite low because I played this originally on Xbox 360 where I have played through the game with most characters and I own all the DLC. Its really worth the money, The Behemoth is a very respectable game maker and it takes you back to the days of playing on NewGrounds. 

Buy a 4 pack of this game and sit down with a group of friends for a fun time.

10/10, I bought it twice and I don't regret it."
21134,Game is very fun. Brings back a lot of nastalgia. Campaign is time consuming and very fun its always a mission to get every pet and weapon in the game
21135,"This game is incredible. Why didnt I like it before then? While there was a sale on it, 50% off, I bought it. and I immediately loved it after the first few levels, and first 30 minutes. The Weapons are fun to use,The Bosses are Fun and Challenging, Cheap DLC Anyone can afford, (and that's great may I add.) and the Insane Mode is incredibly Challenging, yet fun! Similar to Battleblock Theatre's cutscenes, The game could be hilarious at times! I'd definitely recommend you buying this game when you can, because its just so darn fun. Good on ya Behemoth, You've done good once again."
21136,"This is definately an action packed adventure, which is ten times more fun if you have friends to play with. Full of weird and funny stuff."
21137,"
Final Grade: A++ (Singleplayer), A+++ (Multiplayer)

(+) This game is ridiculous fun

(+) Combat is fast paced, responsive to input and feels great. 

(+) Skills are learned with progression through the game and slowly change battle style over time. 

(+) The environments and characters are beautifully drawn and animated 

(+) Levels have a high level of variety. You have plenty of engaging bosses to fight, and most levels have sections where you can break out of the standard formula of just punching stuff. Environments constantly change themselves up between levels as well.

(+) Pets exist in the game as an added way to give flavour to it. You find them in levels and they follow you along, aiding you in combat. They don’t make too huge of a difference, but make the game feel unique.

(+) Presence of a sizable collection of weapons and items is a huge plus. You also have quite a lot of work to do to earn all the weapons

(+) Character progression in the form of levelling up and assigning stat points helps keep the game lively and gives every level added rewards

(+) You always really feel like you are engaged in thrilling action and it really feels epic

(+) The storyline is fairly typical but engages you all the same.

(+) Difficulty is just right, and is never frustrating. Usually a loss can be turned into a win by altering your strategy.

(+) Characters to unlock

(+) Multiplayer exists

(-) Seems to be some lost potential in the items, weapons and pets. I think the main problem with the items is that i only ever used health potions because the other items were useless in comparison to just attacking. Weapons could have offered special skills to the character, like allowing them to use another type of magic. Only the pets that gave boosts to your stats were really useful. The ones that dealt damage did not have enough incentive for me to bring along.

(-) Characters cannot be swapped in the same save. I found this quite annoying because all i really want to do is try out the other characters, but they all have their own separate save files so i need to go through the story with each of them just to really try them out. Just allowing us to swap characters in the same playthrough would have been a better option. The benefit though is that you get replayability.

(-) Arena levels can feel unfair. I get why you can't get rewards DURING the arena, but why not AFTER?"
21138,"i love this game and i think every body should get it is not a vary demanding game since i have a core i3 while running smooth with high graphics

21140,its a good game 100 out of 10. love it.
21141,"This game is just epic. Has so much content to play, yet I want MOAR. The game is fun, though you might get triggered at some fights. It has a good sense of humor, and has nice gameplay. The bosses are really cool too.
[spoiler] Like that one fight where you're being chased by a giant creature down a mill, which has epic battletoads gameplay. He also returns later in the game to fight you on a coach. IT'S FREAKING AWESOME! [/spoiler]
All of the bosses are both terrifying and epic, they keep you on edge at all times. ESPECIALLY the endgame boss.
[spoiler] in the endgame, the boss has 6 seperate stages, each getting harder and harder. It always surprises you when a new phase pops up, it really gets the blood going. The final duel is really kick-butt too, while the space-castle is exploding, you duke it out to see who kills who. again, IT'S FREAKING AWESOME! When you finally beat him you get a rush, just like all endgame bosses should give you [/spoiler]
Overall, Castle Crashers is a beat 'em up done right, with just the right amount of difficulty to keep you pumped everytime. I highly recommend it to anyone."
21142,AMAZING GAME 10/10
21143,exp system kinda sucks
21144,"Oh god, where do I start?

This game is an absolute classic and an actual fun game, it's refreshing to finally play a game where it doesn't have some next level 3D 4k graphics. I adore beat em up games with graphics that are animated and hand drawn, which you can tell how Behemoth puts alot of effort into developing these types of game. That type of attitude is why I highly respect developers like The Behemoth.

Now, onto the actual gameplay:
The gameplay feels smooth after its remaster, however I'd heavily advise using a controller to play this game because it doesn't feel smooth using a keyboard (especially when it's broken and you have to use an external keyboard for your laptop) so it's best preferred using a controller. The game itself is really fun, having creative ways to beat up your enemies with the combos that you unlock when you level up a specific stat (strength and magic) and fight bosses. I'd say more but I did kind of forgot. This game is good with friends too, so make sure they have CC as well."
21145,One of the best co-op games in a while.
21146,Pretty good game
21147,Really good and fun.
21148,"I'm extremely conflicted over this game. I'm not a fan of its art style, nor its controls. The story is 'meh'. The weapons are not fun to use and neither are the abilities - it feels like a chore to play. Not my kind of game."
21149,DON'T even try to play this with an keyboard
21150,This game is fun and is great to play with friends. Not a game for everyone but it’s still great. Make sure you use a controller it’s way easier to play.
21151,"verey god and fun
"
21152,"I played this game a lot on console back in the day and had some great times with it. I would reccommend only playing this game with friends however, because playing it on your own causes it to get redundant awfully fast. There are a variety of modes in this game but all in all I'd reccommend only playing the story, it easily outclasses the other modes in my opinion.
Pretty easily an 8/10, Fun to kill time with friends but lacking in single player viability."
21153,i liked it
21154,I love it
21155,That was quite the amazing game! Nice graphics and story! Had a lot of fun playing it!
21156,"most of the characters are the same but recolored, the hard mode is the laziest most boring shit ive ever played in any game"
21157,"This game is a classic. A beat em up with knights, magic, and behemoth humor. There are a bunch of characters to play as (2 as dlc but they’re 99 cents each, what a steal!) and the gameplay is very fun. You beat up bears, trolls, cultists, and even your friends if you’re playing multiplayer. The game also can give a challenge in its “insane mode” which you can play after you beat the game. The only downside is that multiplayer can get very laggy at some points.


Overall I give it a 8/10"
21158,"I've always loved the game. ever sense i was a small boy my father would put me next to the fire and say ""boy you better not F*@CKING SOMKE"". So to try to prevent me to smoke that icky ciggy he bought me video games. Castle Crashers being the game that I would play like I was lisning to that holy word of god I became frey invested in the adult but cartoon like visuals, nice butter like combat, and SOME WHAT OK DLC."
21159,"I love this game!! Its funny and interesting to boot! If you want to co-op and have an amazing time, pick up this game!"
21160,"Bought for my nephews. Tried it myself. Maybe something I might have enjoyed back in gradeschool (on the famicom) but not now. It gets a little too repetitive and it's clear the devs no longer support the game, they can't even be bothered to fix the mouse cursor bug (yeah it's supposed to disappear by itself, but it does not).
It's ok to waste time with if you have nothing better to do, but between this and Deep Space Waifu, I'd go for Deep Space Waifu."
21161,yes
21162,"Its good. You should buy it, if you have friends."
21163,"Great game! Cute artstyle, fun gameplay, just amazing overall. Replayability is emphasized here, making the game fun to play over and over again! If you want a good action-packed game you can play with friends, there's no better one than Castle Crashers."
21164,"Only play this SH!T (literally) if you like seeing bu11holes, f4rts and sh!ts everywhere. If this kind of stupid joke were used up to the point when it's enough, but no... you gotta go over the roof.
I'll finish this crap just so it doesn't hurt my overall achievement percentage. The stupid humor is almost intolerable."
21165,This game is badass
21166,"This was overall just an astounding game, from the cartoon art style, to the music and the play style. I fell in love with this game the second I played it and then bought it on steam as soon as I could, I very highly reccomend this game to others, plus the game has up to four person multiplayer, I bought a pack of four and sent three copies to friends and now we all play whenever we have time. 12/10"
21167,"I loved the game but after i had completed a fair ammount i had felt like I had seen what the game had to offer, other than my personal lack of interest I reckomend it."
21168,"I don't have friends, and this game isn't fun without them ;-;"
21169,It is very fun and has a lot of action I recommend it.
21170,yes very good
21171,this game is good deal with it :3
21172,i was gifted this game by a close friend for the sole purpose of killing weird and funny enemies and beating each other up to kiss a princess. 10/10 would play again
21173,love it!
21174,"Glade I had a free try of this game inseted of buying it. It is a pritty boring 2D hack and slash, but could be fun with other people but my guess is not."
21175,MOST FUN GAME I HAVE PLAYED WITH FRIEND I DO RECOMEND MY GOOD GENTLEMAN HEHEHHEHEHEHHEHEHEHHEHE
21176,Great crazy fun!
21177,This game is great.  It's really fun if you play with friends
21178,"good game
"
21179,"if anyone knows how to get hatty then can you please tell me 
"
21180,this game is good but the online community is dead
21181,es huut
21182,"The game is great, if you have friends to play with, Super repetitive if alone (and kinda in general)

Reccomend if you have friends, if not be wary"
21183,"It's fun, hilarious, old but gold game

Worth full price, worth the fun"
21184,Best game evah . A little hard and kind of dark souls but gud . 10/10
21185,"I honestly recommend this game! It's really fun if you play with friends, along with it being fun in general! 

The price is pretty good, not that expensive. This is just my opinion on the game though, and my opinion is it's great!"
21186,ok so castle crasher let me explain its a beat em up title were you and up to 4 people can go on a adventure to save some princess with some laughing on the floor humour this will be a great title to have in your game collection
21187,"It's not a bad game per se, I just found it to be too repetitive and boring."
21188,"Mostly fun with friends. On your own it gets a bit... boring, fast."

21190,"good game, one of the best!"
21191,"[h1]Here's what you do:[/h1]
Fight through levels filled with enemies and some bosses to rescue the four princesses and bring peace to the kingdom. Level up, learn new combos, magic, find new items, weapons, and animal companions along the way to become stronger and more versatile.

[h1]What I like:[/h1]
It is a four player cooperative beat'em up game. Local and online play options. Many characters to play as and unlock with slightly varying abilities. Online works well (at least through Steam, can't speak for other platforms). 

[h1]What I don't like:[/h1]
Would be nice if character abilities were a little more varied as most characters play generally the same.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
I would get this primarily for the multiplayer, local or online. Single player is still fun, though not as fun comparatively. This is a good game and I like it a lot.

[h1]Want a demonstration?[/h1]

21192,"A decent platformer that features a lot of different weapons, characters.  The replayability is average noting that there is a +1 mode, but once that has been completed, it doesn't really offer much other than perhaps competing with other players online.  However, even after the game has been finished, it remains a title that one can simply break out to play a game with friends either on the couch or remote.

The downsides to the game are that even though there are a lot of characters, there are only a few one would truly use due to the over powering special attacks noting how they can completely disable an opponent.  On a similar note, even though there are a ton of weapons, one would probably stick with maybe a couple depending if that person uses a specific type of atttack.

Regardless, the play control is well done and simple.  It allows for unique attack styles and tricks.  It does have the frustrations of aligning one in the same hit box as enemies as the older 2d games that have perspective, but that's to be expected."
21193,Fun with friends.
21194,very fun game yaes
21195,"Lot of fun, friends recommended for maximum experience!"
21196,"This game is all about fun.
absolutley lovely ... buy this game and don`t hesitate for even a sec!
and play with friends ... it`s way more fun and challenging.
"
21197,"This is an amazing game that provides hours of fun and exploration, unlocking different characters and weapons, the replayability of this game is endless and playing with friends online or locally makes this game one of my all time favourites."
21198,"GUD GAME WISH IT FREE
"
21199,It's good.
21200,I first got this game for the Xbox 360 since my brothers played it a lot. It's a fantasticc game and I started playing it again and my god it was as fun as the first time I played it.
21201,I all around love the game and i got a chance to play it and it was the best I really think u should get this game best choice ever in life
21202,peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrfect
21203,"this is a cool game also its a good grind and good if your fucking board out of your mind :)
"
21204,The best game to play with your friends when you got bored of something else :D
21205,A clean modern beat'em all. You won't be disappointed if you like the genre.
21206,Very fun game - tried it a bit during the spring cleaning event!
21207,Great game to play off-line and with friends but it's too short and repetitive. Anyway. I recomend this game for anyone!
21208,"it Looks and feels like a flash game  but has Great controlls and great graphics 
8.5/10"
21209,gg
21210,Castle Crashers is a very fun game to play and explor. It is more fun with more people but is still fun if your playing by your self.
21211,10/10 would play again
21212,COOL GAME!
21213,peepee poopoo
21214,Lots of fun especially when played with friends.

21218,cool gaem. 10/10 would play if i had muny
21219,"Cool game nice graphics, gameplay and controls, overall great game!"
21220,"My brother introduced me to this game on Xbox and I just had to buy it for myself. Now I am waiting for my friends to buy it so we can all play together. I love this game! It is not only a light-hearted funny action game, but it is one of my favorite time killers. I never get bored, waiting to see what kind of creatures come next. Even when you finish the game, there are so many other characters to explore and play as. I do not regret buying the DLC's, and in fact encourage buying them. This game was worth it."
21221,Beat it in 5 hours...
21222,Good
21223,"Its a fun game and more so in a local couch. Even tho the game is short its replay value never fades because of all the unlockable characters,sword and pets that keeps the game fresh."
21224,"Super 2D hack'n'slash! Insane mode rulez :D
PS. Red Knight is for pros!! :P"
21225,"The video advert for this made it seem pretty funny and I thought it'd appeal to my seven year old nephews (and me). But it's just a pretty basic platform fighting game thing where you fight a million baddies in pretty much the same way over and over (at least the local co-op mode is like that). The advert seemed to contain all the actual humour rather than the game.

It also didn't launch under steamlink and I had to go read the discussion forum to find a workaround.

"
21226,"Got to play this for the spring cleaning event. Really fun. It kills my fingers, but it's still really fun."
21227,"Really fun & funny casual game to play with friends though it can get pretty hard. Many bosses you won't finish on the first run. Different characters, weapons, and pets to use. Big map to explore; the scenaries change enough for you to not be bored. Mini PvP available. Overall pretty solid couch game."
21228,awsome game love it
21229,fun but hard
21230,If you are playing multiplayer then this should be called cockblocking the game.
21231,this game is sooo fun i played it with my friends i recommend this game
21232,the most amazing game i ever played :)
21233,Really well made  beat'em up game. Castle crasher 2 please?
21234,"kinda old, but still amazingly fun with a fantastic sense of humour put in by the devs. I don't recall any other games that let you escape a giant furry while riding a deer being propelled by the velocity of its projectile shit"
21235,Fun game.
21236,This game's art is spectacular! Really beautifully designed game!!!!! Very nostalgic too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
21237,Good
21238,"[h1]Great for couch co-op [/h1]

Hint: this game is always on sale (+75%)"
21239,"After playing this game with friends over its recent free weekend I can not reccomend spending any real ammount of money  on this game. It is boring and repetitive, and the humor mostly falls flat."
21240,I love this game and it is filled with so many fun features and items.
21241,"Really fun fighter game, the art style and music is really good and fitting, refrences to old games is really neat too. Just another great Behemoth game"
21242,lit game
21243,No... Just no.
21244,un trop bon jeu
21245,"A fun lil party game which should be played with 3 friends for maximum Fun
Recommended"
21246,"10/10 One of the best game out there
9/11 With friends"
21247,"A great game 5/5 stars, played it on the Xbox when I was young, its still really fun and now it is easier to play with friends! :)"
21248,"I like the game even though I only made it to ,,Catfish"", I think it is really fun."
21249,"Great game,every thing is amazing"
21250,"one the best games growing up, when i found it on here i was excited. even if you have a shitty computer this game runs extremly smotth, no lag or anything. one of the best games out there."
21251,"The story is simple, the gameplay is simple, the humor is simple. And it all works fairly well. 

It's not as funny as Battleblock theater, but the gameplay is more fun. Classic arcade style beat em up. 

The green princess is the best. Watch how she reacts when you come to rescue her!"
21252,Amazing
21253,Game is fun.
21254,"One of my best favorite games. Just buy it, it's totally awesome. Play with friends to double the fun."
21255,"it's cool and it's funny
"
21256,Very Funny
21257,"This Game is Really Gud ,"
21258,One of the best games I've ever played. This games' rendering is so good that at max graphics you can play with 60 fps on an Asus eee pc (netbook). I defenalty recomend it.
21259,"Good game, it is very funny wehn i play with my friends."
21260,"My switch pro controller doesnt work 
garbage game"
21261,Its so amazing!
21262,Good and Fun Game and also funny i recommend buying this game
21263,"This game has taught me a life lesson.

Kill your friends to get the girl"
21264,very confused
21265,"One of the best fighting games in my opinion, really challenging, and addictive. Wish they would fix the 1-2 second delay on multiplayer though, unfortunate that I couldn't even play with a friend of mine due to ridiculous stuttering, we even tried doing what the forums page suggested to make it stutter less, and it did little to nothing in terms of improvement to performance. Makes performing any combos at all a nightmare"
21266,Medieval Final Fight with RPG leveling.
21267,"Had fun playing this on my XB360 many years ago, and now, it's still very enjoyable. 
It proves that a high-quality game is timeless.
Very easy to pick up so I prefer playing locally ,
 just call your friends ,order pizzas and enjoy."
21268,"It's pretty rad, a great storyline. Pretty disturbing though, to the end, but I won't go into detail. What are you waiting for? Your adventure awaits!"
21269,NICE! love it :3
21270,Love the game have been wanting it for a while.
21271,"I liked it
"
21272,i hope it free :(
21273,i beat this game in just a few hours and i love it!
21274,i liked it very much
21275,"This is not very good mario game, it has swords with Luigi and other characters but now they have random ""knights"" which I don't like.

If you like fighting games its good but I no like."
21276,"awesome game to play with friends, but wish theyd have better servers.."
21277,good stuff
21278,GG for Castle Crashers
21279,"I only played this game for about 2 hours, but it was honestly really fun.
I think because i was playing with friends it made it interesting; and i think thats what they were going with but it works."
21280,a steam e filha da puta baixei gratis e expirou sem nenhum motivo
21281,good game and funny
21282,Loved this game it remindes me of my childhood
21283,devs are chads
21284,"Damn you, Steam spring cleaning!"
21285,"Been playing with my brothers on Xbox 360 since 2009, and 9 years later, it still kicks assholes all day.
10/10 would ride a shitting deer again."
21286,hey i left this on idle for an hour can i write a funny review about it now?
21287,I love it so much!!!!!!
21288,Great game
21289,"Awesome game,it takes time and kinda skill but i totaly like it <3 <3 <3"
21290,Good game 10/10 love it and ate it
21291,It has so much action! Makes the game intense. It makes it more fun with online multiplayer!
21292,very good game if you play with your friends
21293,this game was fun and gets boring because it gets repetetive. i recommend it for under 10$
21294,"Really good gameplay and graphics. I recomend to play with friend or you will get bored real fast, that may be only down of this very great game"
21295,It's amazing!
21296,This is quite the fun game in my opinion. Do get it if you have friends to play it with.
21297,"Old school fun, reminisent of Streets of Rage, Golden Axe, and other arcade side scrollers."
21298,It is pretty good. The campaign is epic and it is even better to play with friend! 10/10
21299,Best with friends!
21300,"This game has it all. Humor, great game play, co-op. It still has re-playability. If you are a fan of side scrolling, action games just like they used to make (River City Ransom, Double Dragon, et al) then you can't pass this up!"
21301,"Playing with friends is funny mode
Playing alone is serious mode"
21302,"I have played this game a long time ago. I used to just charge in on the enemies and start hitting them with a lightsaber, a frost sword, a candle and even a lobster. I completed the game once, and left it off multiple times because it got boring playing alone.

But everything changed when Steam Spring Cleaning 2018 attacked.
I told my friends to try out the game, and my friends came to the conclusion of a new meta
Instead of just hitting the enemies, YOU CAN NOW JUMP AND HIT THEM AIRBORNE WHILE YOU PUSH FORWARD AND GLIDE UNTIL THEY HIT THE GROUND.
The new jumping meta also includes:
+Levelling up faster than way before!
+Unlimited feeling of superiocity
+Endless laughing at the misery of the enemy(or enemies!) you are carrying along when you are gliding in the air
+Joining forces with all of your friends and hitting the helpless enemies at the borders of the wave.
+Making sure the enemy is dead after hitting them a million times at said border

So, definitely buy the game if you're playing with friends. 
*You can also look for the can't stop crying/laughing bundle for Battleblock Theater, another game from the same developer."
21303,asdasd
21304,"Hmm. I tried its brief weekend, but I cannot seem to control my character correctly in a local game even though I rechecked my keyboard settings. Help didn't show how to control the character as well. It's not user friendly. However, the game ran very nice on my decade old PC with 6 GB of RAM, ATI Radeon 4870 video card (512 MB of VRAM), 64-bit W7 HPE SP1, etc. It doesn't seem to be new player and keyboard friendly. :("
21305,"First tried the game for free during the spring cleaning event and loved it. Its a cheap, easy to get used to and extremely fun title which is good for both playing on your own or with friends (jk i dont have friends). If you've every played battleblock theatre then it's almost exactly the same as that, which is a good thing since battleblock theatre is amazing.

Positives:
- Easy controls
- Good timewaster
- Fun
- Cheap

Negatives:
- Slightly repetative
- Button masher(kind of)

"
21306,"What the hell are you doing reading reviews?
Go play it, it's good stuff!"
21307,good
21308,"Game tells me that it found game, but as soon as it gets to lobby it's empty."
21309,"Yech, I don't even know what to do and the game really doesn't explain it well. Pretty but usless at least to me."
21310,the best
21311,"OK I PULL UP!

21312,"Well, this is fucking amazing. Very cool graphics and very nice mechanics for a 2d fight game. And the coop mode is beyond perfect.

10/10 would deus vult again"
21313,very good
21314,"I wish the online portion had jump in and jump out matchmaking but if someone doesn't join while sitting in the lobby for 30 minutes then no one will join mid match.  Unless they've fixed that but it hasn't really changed much since the game came out.  

I miss playing this game at its peak on the Xbox 360 when there was always a 4 player group going through it.  It's worth buying for sure as it's a classic, it's annoying though that I had to rebuy the game on PC and restart from a fresh save file after leveling up all my characters.  I hate playing this game alone because it gets boring fast, but with others it's such a fun coop experience.
 
I'm super disappointed there was never a server browser added for PC nor a jump in and jump out during gameplay function to save the online play, if someone leaves your team during a game at any point you will need to close the game and reform the lobby.  No one ever plays this online anymore, thanks devs for helping to make console matchmaking BS the standard on PC games."
21315,game?
21316,"This is cute and fun to play with others. You can invite friends, and I like to play wiht my brothers. It is simplistic, but fun and super cute!"
21317,Love this game..i rate this game 10/10 since u can make inf combos XD
21318,it sucks
21319,Hours of fun for any skill level. More fun with friends.
21320,"Played this to completion back on the 360, good to have it again, amazing game."
21321,mt show
21322,If you wanna ride a pooping deer while being chase by a giant cat than this is the game for you !
21323,The controls are very confusing so try and use an xbox controller if you can.
21324,mito demas o jogo mujto fueda!!!
21325,"HOLY FUCK,FOR REAL?
DIS IS GREAT,OH I MEAN DIS IS BEST FROM THE BEST GAME EVER!1!1!1..
AND THEN I ENJOY TO LISTEN THE MUSIC ESPECIALLY FROM WATERFLAME SONG!1!1!
maqlo ngedrag ea pant8"
21326,"10/10 Would murder my friends to kiss the girl all over again. That moment where there is 4 newbs playing the game, the game just stops, no enemies, just the girl you have been desperadly trying to get back, none moves, just looking around and then someone strikes other for the sake of it and its a free for all. Hilarious!!!
I like the designs, you truly feel like a knight.
The music takes you back to those games you played when younger, the 2D plantaform games, like mario or pokemon. I really liked that aspect of it. The formula is still the same.
Only played the multiplayer part for like 2 or 3 hours. Its a multiplayer game, altought there is a solo player, its game made to be played with friends talking on the microfone.
Had a wonderfull time and will get it this summer for sure."
21327,For the best experience play with your friends.
21328,very good with friends
21329,"It's probably one of the worst games i have ever played, like for real, there is 0 castles being crashed in this game, it's advertising is completely false."
21330,ITS GOOD
21331,i can't finish the lvl one too much complicated
21332,"Although there are some mistakes and boring parts this game is almost dangerously charming. The graphics are lovely and creative, each and every boss is an experience to remember, all the little gags in the background make you smile and the oh so perfectly dumb humour is just the cherry on top. This fantasy teamed adventure is one of the best party games I have ever played. Though it's successor BattleBlock Theater is where the team perfectly figured out their style's perfect use, this is also a must for everybody that has ever seen and liked at least one fantasy movie (or book/game of course)"
21333,"I love this game so much.  It makes you feel op but at the same time totally destroys you.  The soundtrack is great, the style is great.  I will say I'm not a fan of beat-em up sidescrollers, but this game is different.  Totally recommend"
21334,It's a fun brawler!
21335,"Well this game is a beat em up but definietly not close to the caliber of a Streets of Rage or even a Final Fight (honeslty Streets of Rage is the best with nothing even close to it. 

Did not play it too much but it is more fun with friends. It offers some slight customization and upgrades but in the end not too much thought is required. Play it for some mindless co-op but do not expect too much.

Trochę podoba mi się ta gra.

Редко играю Кастле Крашерс."
21336,"Funny game, recommend to play with your friends ."
21337,"Can't say I enjoyed this one. Compared to bastion, dust, or Mark of the ninja the controls feel a bit off. Sure it's a fun game, but it's not for me."
21338,"Cute yet crude humor, great art work. Worth every penny."
21339,Love the game! Its so addictive and almost never boring!
21340,"Controls are too difficult, and the combat is basically button smashing.
It has nice animations though..."
21341,gud
21342,it a saver for my potato pc thanks:))
21343,"I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead, every single one of them. And not just the men, but the women and the children, too"
21344,"its alright after u rebind the keys
"
21345,"Breaks all audio on the computer while open, not just from the game but from any source. A quick search of the steam discussions lead me to believe it's because I use a blutooth headset for my audio but that means the game is trying to do something fancy with it rather than just using the OS to play sound. It's probably a decent game if you don't use a blutooth headset but no audio while playing, not even from other appplicaions means I can't reccomend this game."
21346,BAd
21347,nice game
21348,awsome game
21349,epic
21350,is the best
21351,"This game is one of my Favorite Games of All time. I first picked it up on the XBox 360, after seeing my dad and his friends playing it. And boy, was it fun. The combat is very smooth, and the multiple characters, weapons, animal orbs, etc. made it feel like it was my own adventure. Eventually, I made friends who had the game, and playing it with them was 10x more fun than playing by myself. If you have friends with this game, definetly get it. You'll have hours of fun. I'd give it a 9/10, only taking off the single point because my favorite knight and the first one I ever used (Green Knight) is supposedly not good, and that makes me salty."
21352,Error : game balance not found
21353,"it's nice
"
21354,самая крутая игра
21355,"A fun and amazing game to play, it also has magic :v"
21356,"mas fome la wea, digna de minijuegos online"
21357,"well i dont know why its got over whelmingly positive 
sucks the reproductive organ of a donkey"
21358,"If you're a solo player , I feel sorry for you .

Great gameplay , might be quite hard in early games but as soon as you've got the grip on it , you're good to go . Also , my new ps4 controller has lose the triangle prints on the button due to the button mashing . 10/10 good game to lose the prints (also a good way to lose your new controller if you often found yourself rage quitting)"
21359,nice game
21360,funy game :D

21362,Great !!!
21363,Is very good.
21364,brings back great memories of playing with my friends on my 360. great game no matter what system
21365,idk
21366,"Tried it for free, the first forest levels are already way too hard, no point in trying 10 times to get past 6 enemy archers."
21367,literally brought back memories of playing this game with my sister.
21368,muy buen juego para jugarlo con la gentita!
21369,chegg user oowah down nut die
21370,"I loved the game in everyway, the humor, battles and gameplay itself, i hope you will keep on making great games like battle block theater and pit people, love your games!"
21371,"this game has many levels,many items,and many bosses,unfortunatly,its far too easy for me,making the bosses feel like normal monsters,and the levels go by far too fast and with far too little challenge."
21372,cool very battle game
21373,a amazing game that is fun to play 10/10
21374,"I very highly recomend this game and get the bundle pack for you and friends because it's the most fun you will have in a long time. I had the game when it came out on the x-box and my brother, neighbor and I have played it till this day. I just got the free weekend deal so that's why I don't have very many hours but if I could geuss how many hours I had on the x-box, it would probably be over a thousand. It will be one of my favorite games forever. 10/10 or whatever is also 10/10 because when you get this game, you will not want to stop playing it for hours."
21375,Aun no lo termino pero es muy entrentenido
21376,it will break your fingers if you dont use a xbox controller but overall other then the keyboard controls its alright
21377,fun
21378,i'm playing it for the free weeked and i played it befor on a much olded steam accunt and i loved it
21379,"This is a good game, but i would hesitate to recommend it with out friends to play with, and never play with out a controller the keyboard maping is BAD!
but still colorfull and fun."
21380,I want to drink with my pals and play this
21381,"Played during free weekend. Those promotions really do work, I never looked twice at this game before, but it's on my radar now. Lot's of fun!"
21382,GG
21383,good
21384,"The troll level on insane is probably the most annoying, level you'll ever experience in any person's time of playing this game.  The ""Mother Troll"" (lets just call it that) spawns soo many of its ""Baby Trolls,"" after the ""Mother Troll"" is like 10%-20% 
health, it moves everytime you hit it once. So I hightly recommend that you try to beat this boss with a friend, or even someone that has beat the game. But, the rest of the game is amazing."
21385,"Great game to get casual gamers to play something with you, however would not recommend playing singleplayer."
21386,eskeetit
21387,yes
21388,This game is a slow and clunky beat-em-up that is worse than the arcade games it imitates.
21389,"Windows 10 and the game won't start .Castle Crashers CRASHED. Free weekend, thanks for nothing"
21390,knights
21391,Awesome!
21392,good
21393,"fun
"
21394,Every time i load in it kicks me out everytime
21395,"Played on the free weekend for the Spring Clean thing, onl yplayed 5 minutes or so but I might actually buy this, I enjoyed what little I played a lot more than I expected I would"
21396,Fun little multiplayer side scrolling beat'em up. Just used all the descriptions in the search bar - this game combines them in a fun little experience that you can play with others! It doesn't require much in hardware and has easy controller support. Fun fo rthe youngins as well!
21397,This Game Is Really Fun! My Friend Owns The Xbox Version And I Wanted To Buy It. After I Bought It I Thought It Was So Fun.
21398,"Really Fun Always been a fan of this developer. 

Hopefully, they will make a sequel in the future."
21399,"I only played a brief amount of this game (due to receiving a free trial during the 2018 Steam Spring Cleaning Event) but this is a very interesting game with amazing art, good music, comedy, and a good community. The gameplay is fun, easy to learn, and addictive. The art style reminds me of old newgrounds games. The music also gives me a sense of nostalgia for old newgrounds games. I recommend this to anyone who likes to play beat em ups with good art and combat."
21400,"This game is a button mashing mayhem, and I have no idea what's going on! The stunning in this game is very strong for the enemies, and you can't get up. Then they charge you with their melee, and then you can't get up after that. If you don't use your shield, you WILL die. It's not even that fun in general either. It's pretty boring honestly."
21401,.
21402,yes
21403,gg
21404,10/10 would recommend again
21405,"i was DEUS VULTING arround on the castle...
got invaded...
Deus vult the barbaroi
then set sail 
Deus Vult the ninjas
got kiddnapped by an alien...
Deus vult the spaceship and the aliens
Deus vult the pooping animals..
Deus vult the sarracen on the desert.
Deus vult snowman in the mountains.
game 111/45 would Deus Vult again
Deus definitely Vult tonight"
21406,"This game is a perfect example of why reviews should not be allowed for people who play games simply on the free days or weekends. Like other games if you look at the reviews before a free weekend and then after a free weekend you will see that there will be in most cases be positive reviews given by people who played the games for free. I mean how can you be critical if you got something for free? Right? In most cases people won't be. Well, in my case I'll be honest. This game is not for me. I give it a YUCK!!! out of 10. Yet another Steam trash game for toasters and tablets. No thanks."
21407,I'm just doing this for the Badge. It's a pretty great game though. Lots of fun times.
21408,";)
"
21409,"One of the best beat'em ups I've ever played in my life...and I'm old enough to have played Golden Axe. 

Castle crashers is fun yet complex enough to be played multiple times, it offers a bunch of unlokcable characters besides the regular ones, a lot of weapons and the best of all: local 4-player multiplayer. 

Buy one copy and invite your friends home to play like the in the good old days, before this horrible thing called ""the internet"" alienated you and your friends (online multiplayer available too, lol)."
21410,"oh yeah. Castle Crashers has to be one of, if not the best nostalgic side scrolling beat-em-up combo-centric newgrounds-inspired 4 player co-op games to date."
21411,Use gamecube controllers.
21412,nice & funny game <3
21413,recomendo
21414,"Absolutely amazing game, from the variety of characters, to weapons, to pets, you can never choose your favorite because you might never have all of them. The animations are downright awesome, considering its a 2D game. The only bad part is that there is an amount of grinding in the game that you may just want to stop, but after you have grinded all those levels, there is always more discoveries. Surprisingly not 'button-mashing' although you might do it at the start, there is some strategy in the game to combos and how you approach certain enemies. There is also some hilarious content that I will let other people experience and not spoil it. Online is also very fun playing with randoms, but its even better playing with friends because of the funny moments you have. Will give 10/10 for anyone who loves a funny, fun to play with friends, classic beat em up game."
21415,"This is very good game!   I love how it pays homage to the classic games of before, but at the same time adds new flare to the beat em-up genre.   Definitely will be getting this game in the near future after I catch up with my back log of games."

21420,yes yes
21421,"Hack and Slash side scroller with magic slapped on with the cliche of a knight saving the princess; online co-op optional. I love it! This game is worth it at full price. It's DLC is also dirt cheap; there are two at 1.09 CAD each. 

Boss fights have their own little intracasies in terms of dodging attacks and finding the right moment to strike. Levels are varied in game play with nice mini-games fit in. There also seems to be PvP mode for singles and teamfights.
"
21422,"Enjoyed it, got to beat up my pals, and kiss a few babes.

Of course, there is dlc...which means more dead friends, and more cute chicks ;)"
21423,This review is more of a note to myself rather than others. I have tried this game during a free trial and didn't like it. Negative review will help me to avoid buying it in a future. The game isn't bad per se. Just too simple for me.
21424,"Game launches in a tiny window on my desktop, around 10 % of its size. When I ""go full screen,"" that window moves into the top left corner and it lowers the resolution of the desktop to a smudgy mess. Then when I want to start a game, the button does not work. Then there's 1700 positive reviews on a single day in the Steam stats, 5 years after game launched? Aha. I wonder how many more than zero are real ones?

Anyway, this game is obviously broken, as it is not my rig: 32 GB RAM, R 1700, GTX 1070, Win 10, runs pretty much anything else. In my personal opinion, it would be better for everyone if the developer fixed the game instead of posting fake reviews. Oh, wait, did I just say that? I was only thinking aloud... no offence!
"
21425,Castle Crashers is a great game!!
21426,Wtf Steam.
21427,Very Crude
21428,"Tried free for 40 minutes, got mixed feeling about this

I'm not gonna talk about the story nor visuals as it is cartoonish and already adorably fun game, especially in co-op.

The main problem is the combat system itself - at one hand you can see this is a deep potential hack & slash/beat 'em up game, with different moves and weapons to combine together. But on the other hand, you feel something is not right and goes badly. 

To describe it further - you can air attacking enemies continuously while pushing them onward; however, doing attack  on ground and you must stay exactly in one place, cannot move nor pushing them plus open yourself vulnerable to others - that means it is hard to connect a ground combo, and likely to get hits more instead. In addition, the animation and input of attack: on air - fast and responsive, on ground - disjoint and cheesy, including shield. You can feel the impact when doing air attacks and not while ground ones. Throwing and using magic could aid in a bit, but you cannot expect any better.

Thanks to the ""not right"" combat system, the boss fights are confusing mess as well. To begin with, most attacks of bosses are wide area range, and you [b]cannot run[/b] + [b]immobile combat on ground[/b] will rekt yourself most likely. And probably because of that, suddenly the game gives you frequent health like it knows how bad it is to fight. 

Furthermore, the game mainly aim for co-op thus doing solo will be tough. First stage - okay not bad. Second stage - hmm a bit long but fine. Third stage - do light atk and strong atk do anything different? I feel the dmg done jack sh!t. Fourth stage onward - I guess I have to button smash until everything dies.

To sum up - good concept but controversial execution if counting the single player mode only. I do not hate it but I also do not get interested into it (yet). So, Not recommend for me (should've been mixed but there is no option). However, if with friends then I believe ""Overwhemingly Positive"" does not lie.

P.S: this game really give me the feeling of ""Either you pay or you weak"" like those cash grab mobile ones although I know 100% it isn't."
21429,great game 10/10
21430,Fun to play with your friends
21431,"A side scrolling hack and slash. I don't know what else to say, because there is so much going on. The most pure form of orchestrated chaos. 10/10 (If only my opinion mattered.)"
21432,A really cool game to play with friends :)
21433,It's good
21434,Castle Crashers is a boring simplistic brawler that lacks enemy variety. After 15-20 minutes of pressing A/W/S near the exact same enemies over and over again i just wanted it to be over. What's worse is that you may accidentally click the wrong game in the menu and end up playing some godawful dodging game instead - without any explanation whatsoever.
21435,very bom jogo
21436,"A fun game for soloing but best if played with friends. Entertaining, good story and jokes. Nice level design. Intuitive gameplay."
21437,Fun and always will be!

21448,10/10 - This game is amazing - BUY IT NOW
21449,"I played Castle Crashers for about 30 hours one weekend with a buddy, and now I never have to play it again."

21451,"I am the worst at this game.  The online multiplayer is still active and visually the game looks great, I am just horrible at it.  I would still recommend trying it out though. 8/10"
21452,Castle Crashers is a really fun game for a whole party to play and it is also fun to play by yourself as well!

21461,"I played CC solo and had a blast, so I'm assuming it's even more fun doing local/online multiplayer. I normally get bored of hack and slash games before beating them but this game was the perfect length to keep me engaged without being too long or short. I beat CC during a free weekend, but there's a lot of replayability so I would still suggest buying it on sale just to unlock all the characters and play with friends."

21481,i love this game this game have geometry dash music and fun
21482,I just test the game yesterday and i love it a cool adventure game a real funny game you can play with your friends and there's dlcs purple guy and pink guy
21483,"Played over 100 hours on xbox360 back in the day
Still just as enjoyable and I played furing the free weekend so even better
Make sure you annoy a friend into playing it with you as I did"
21484,"I like this game, a few gliches though.:D
(played during free weekend)"
21485,"Negative, because...

[b]It is a two button hack and slash.[/b] And by that I mean, really. There is a light and a heavy attack (where the heavy is actually faster than the light), but combinating them does not mean a thing, cuz combination is like nothing. The attack looks different a bit without any other advantage.

[b]Attack or def, the two won't do together.[/b] The fight mechanics is another terrible part. The attack animation is way too long, you cannot guard in time after an attack and you cannot break your attack to def instead. It is kinda a huge disadvantage since opponents love to shoot arrows at you or throwing bombs that you want to block or evade. And since an arrow or a bomb is as fast as your unbreakble slash, you will be damaged. So you can do nothing with your reflexes in this hack and slash. Which is a huge missing part for me in a hack and slash.

[b]Self-repeating just after the first 5 minutes ?[/b] It is a new record of the self repeating genre for me. I went deeper into the game but it did not change at all.

[b]Boss fights without the feeling you're actually bossing.[/b] The bosses are nothing but bigger enemies with 3 attack sequences that they repeat till you kill them. Except some, since their size matches yours however, the rest stays. After you learn that very difficult sequence (khm..), the bosses not even can hurt you. Their minions are way bigger threat than the boss theirselves.

[b]Hitboxes are horrible.[/b] If the opponent isn't in front of you (exactly) then you can't hit them. This ""move exactly in front of them to hit them"" is frustating. Then make a pure 2D platformer without the 3D movement instead.

[b]Supposed to be funny, but eh..?[/b] Perhaps my sense of humor is horrible, but except some smiles, I did not laugh at all. It is an unsuccessful combination of a serious hack and slash with humor elements. Cuz this game tries to be serious way too much.

[b]Money for a flash game..?[/b] It is obvious that everything can be sold, but I've seen far better and less frustating (read above) flash games for free.

[i]Tried it during the ""Play it for free for 2 days"" peroid.[/i]"

Otherwise amazing game, fully recommend."
21495,Just beat the game and it was amazing. The storyline was simple and easy to understand what your objective was. After beating the game you arn't even close to done you still can buy and find pets hiding in places while you can unlock different characters to get achievements. Beating the game on insane means you know how to play the game. All in all I would give it a solid 8/10!
21496,A fantastic beat ‘em up with some RPG leveling and a boatload of silly weapons and characters. The game looks amazingly good in HD on this PC version. This is a ton of fun with friends. Highly recommended.
21497,Great hack and slash beat'um up game.  Still holds up and has that classic NES feel.

21645,nice
21646,This game is very good. I love playing it and have defeated it many times. i`ll say it takes about 3-6 hours to beat the game. For me it usually takes around three hours. I love the art style of the game too. There are so many characters to unlock and beat the game with!
21647,You can ride a deer in this game.
21648,"Castle Crashers is a side-on brawler, like Final Fight or Streets of Rage. It's one of those basically fun, viscerally satisfying genres, like Old-School FPS. While it's mechanically fairly basic, its presentation is what really sells it.

The game leans hard into its fun-cutesy-cartoon-with-some-adult-themes-and-weird-fucked-up-shit aesthetic, which sometimes veers into puerile or juvenile territory, but mostly manages to be fun and entertaining. There's one fucking insane-looking boss in particular that shows up twice and I really love the design of, both for how strange and horrible it looks by itself and for how hard it contrasts with all the big-headed cartoon characters around it. You'll know it when you see it.

The gameplay is classic brawling fun, with a few more modern additions. There's a nice variety of things you can do to enemies, and the hit feel is fairly solid. An RPG leveling system's been added, which isn't really necessary but allows for some variety in how you play, I guess. There's also kind of a combo focus, which mostly means that if you mash the attack buttons at enemies long enough and in the right way, you both kind of levitate for a bit and they die a whole lot faster. Again, it's not necessary, but it is kind of nice. Overall, the gameplay's functional, but the cartoon graphics and visual gags are the main focus.

I also think the game could really use health bars for enemies. Especially with the really tanky ones, it'd be nice to know exactly how much longer this beating session is going to go on.

Castle Crashers also aims to be a multiplayer party game. I didn't really explore that aspect of it that much, but it seems like it'd be good for that. Four people running around and hitting monsters is always a good way to pass the time, if nothing else.

Castle Crashers is a good time overall. The gameplay has some mechanics it doesn't really need, a few of the jokes fail to land, and whaling on the same group of enemies for two minutes with no idea of how much longer it'll take isn't fun, but when the game works, it works well, and generally manages to be quite entertaining. I recommend you give it a look, and maybe goof off with some friends with it."
21649,i played 13h in one day. very nice
21650,"Castle Crashers, One of the most successful indie games of all time.

Castle Crashers is a beat 'em up genre of game made by the Behemoth Team. The Behemoth have also created amazing titles such as Alien Hominid, Battleblock Theater and most recently, Pit People. The game follows 4 knights of different elemental powers on a journey to stop a Evil Wizard and save the 4 Princesses scattered across the world. But does this game still hold up today?

Starting the game, you are granted 4 characters to start with (5-7, If you purchased Battleblock Theater and the 2 DLC packs) and are thrusted into the very simple, but effective story. Gameplay is set with 3 kinds of attacks: Weak, Strong, and Magic, Each can be used to make devastating combos on the various enemies you encounter. You also have a shield, that blocks all attack except for magic and attacks from behind, and some other types of weapons like Bows and boomerangs.

Since the setting is in Medieval times, many of the, Enemies, Weapons, and environments, are based around this theme, but not every level is in a medieval style, which I won't spoil. The game also has a ton of comedic valve and without using any dialogue. One of the assists for your characters adventure are Animal Orbs, orb-shaped animals that give bonuses or assists your character in battling the foes. Characters and weapons have been placed in a ranking system from SS to E- this organizes all 31 characters, ranking every aseptic about each character and comparing it to the others. This can be useful for your first time, unless you don't want to be spoiled, and I wish I knew It because I beat the entire game with Hatty Hattington, apparently the worst character in the game (E-). 

After completing the game (SPOILER ALERT), you unlock Insane mode where nearly all the enemies and bosses have x10 the health, attack power and are faster than normal. completing this mode can be brutal with the x10 rule, Sidenote you can only play characters in insane mode that have beat the game and have earn a skull. The game also supports local and online multiplayer and has 2 extra modes. Arena, puts the player against a horde of enemies, unless you are in multiplayer, where you challenge your friends instead And Back off Barbarian, replacing the All you can Quaff button mashing mini-game, you and 3 others avoid enemies on a grid map using the Buttons or Arrow keys to move across without being killed. The achievements are low in numbers and not too challenging and the game also has Steam trading cards and badges to level up your profile. 

Castle Crashers's music is fantastic, with many of the themes coming from New-grounds users. unfortunately, the Soundtrack isn't available on Steam, however, it is available on New-grounds for free! (I would still but the soundtrack if it came over) and to show my love of the soundtrack here is a short list of my 5 favorite tracks

1. Piercing Lazer/Simple Sight (Necromancer's theme)
2. Space Pirates (Thieves Forest)
3. Till Death Do You Part (Wedding Crash)
3. Factory (Various Bosses)
4. Child of the Corn (2 bosses)

The few issues I have with the game are:
1. The AI can sometimes spam arrows and bombs, very annoying
2. Back of Barbarian can be very confusing.
3. The game only saves level progress on certain levels, not every single level.
4. Insane Mode, at least it is optional

Overall, The Behemoth's second title and my first beat 'em up game, has great gameplay, character, and wonderful music, made this game wonderful to play again and again. extremely worth the 15 dollars, but I recommend to wait until its on sale, because, this is the Steam Version I'm reviewing about. Well I doubt there will be the sequel, I am very excited on what the The Behemoth comes up next. Also as a final note, best ending ever!

(P.S. I bought the Can't Stop Laughing Bundle when it was $5.99 when Battleblock Theater was on sale for $2.99, Another great game from the Behemoth!)"

But alas, after defeating the evil wizard who nearly met world's demise, the knights could not find the man who once completed the team. So they gave up.

21689,"At full RRP: No way. At the discount of £2 maybe. If you're in to a side scrolling button mash.

This game is inherently flawed in a lot of ways. Compounding that is that whoever ""remastered"" it introduced a number of thier own.

My first issue is that this game is supposed to be near infinitely replayable. With completely unskippable cutscenes.

You'll watch the same thing over and over and over again. Especially if you die. Which happens a lot.

The game's difficulty curve feels really off. Spiking in weird intervals. The grassland level is stupidly difficult for no reason. The lava level is insanely difficult (especially as a fire mage character), and the necromancer you just can't see what's happening on the screen for most of the fight.

The last boss is comparatively super easy.

There's no difficulty adjustment though, just a 10x mode after you beat the game (enemies have 10x hp, and 10x damage)

Which is stupidly annoying because the game already feels like a super mash anyway. You have to keep smashing your face in to the keyboard until they all fall, and there's no apparent skill. No health bars so you can see how much more damage you need to do to any particular enemy, makes it feel even more so.

What adds salt to the wound is that the only way of gaining XP is ""number of hits to an enemy"". So if you try to get the whole thing over with and max strength say, you'll end up not levelling fast enough anymore, to ever get the defence stats to survive a certain level, exacibating the grind issue. For EVERY playthrough (of which there again are supposed to be many)

The game also forces you to revisit areas after getting new gadgets way later in the game.

I guess this is to compensate for a completely linear boring map, which is really hard to navigate step by step, key by key. I mean, they could have added mouse support, to make it easier to go to different areas more quickly, but that would have been too easy.

Back to the point that the game was ""remastered"". Whoever did it has no feel for game design or balancing at all.

They ""rebalanced"" all the weapons to make the best ones (and most difficult to get) complete garbage, with now the most powerful non-magic weapon being a fucking HAM. Not only is this insulting, but it makes the flow of the game completely off-key. Defeat the ENTIRE game with the (wiki rated) worst starting basic character, the orange knight, and you'll find yourself with a powerful fire demon, who might actually get something out of his magic unlike the aforementioned knight.

Only his starting weapon's been nerfed from the best magic bonus in the game to almost nothing. None of the other stats have changed. The weapon level requirement is still the same. Just the best stat has been nerfed to oblivion.

That's the reward for beating the game. Great.

Another annoyance is that this fire demon goes to the fire level, and does absolutely no magic damage to other fire demons. He doesn't even stun them, even if the fire magic does more damage than the melee attacks which DO stun. But the enemies still do full fire damage to you. But that's possibly just my personal gripe.

When we're at the griping, I'll also add that I had to rebind every single key to make it playable.

To experienced games, I'll save you the hassle, and tell you just to go to the settings, and rebind keys to these: 
WASD - movement keys
space - jump
Shift - shield
QE - Item select
F - item use
J - light attack
K - heavy attack
L - magic

You don't really get to use the mouse, and this is the best for natural effect of movement, without reaching over yourself to hit any particular key

I say WASD as if they're all valid movement directions, but really it's a 2D game, and the up and down keys will change your plane of existence.

There are no attacks up or down, so the easiest way to dodge is going in one of those directions.

This also makes it maniacally difficult to hit those enemies, who stand ever so slightly askew to you vertically, and you have to be constantly moving and watching the tiny shadows on the floor rather than any of the art itself to tell what's going on.

I say there's no vertical attacks, but you can ""almost attack"" some big things. And for bosses, or larger things, it's sometimes possible to either stand just above them pressing down , or just below pressing up to ""hug"" them. 

Then jump in the air, and keep mashing your attacks to get free combos off while the boss is completely helpless to retaliate.

This isn't the only ""glitch"", but others aren't as bad.

For example, you can keep doing the first boss to ""farm"" his gold. Which doesn't really matter until you beat the game, and are asked to fork out about 50+ levels (or that bosses) gold worth to get 4 or 5 items at the end.

Not that this matters of course, because again, the stats of most things have been nerfed to hell, so why bother.

Another thing a completionist hates is crappy achievements.

These are the stupidest, shortest, most pointless achievements I have seen in a game barring that one game that gave you a full gamerscore on Xbox for just launching it.

There's no achievement for a large combo, or juggle. There's no achievement for beating a boss with only magic (but there is with melee for some reason). There's none for getting all the weapons. There's none for the glitch weapons. 

But there is one for ""max strength"" on a catapult half way through a level somewhere for no reason, which you have to keep replaying large sections with cutscenes if you want to reattempt. There's only one in the game, and there's no other incentive for even trying to get any particular ""strength"" on the launch, as it launches you in pretty much the same area whatever strength you get.

I have a feeling that initially you had to beat all the end bosses in a row without stopping, but they changed it, because it was too drudgerous.

More or less again like the lava level. You have to spend a long time going through the actual level before you get a hard boss, which makes the game punishing, not difficult. Which just sucks for the player, and feels more like an arcade cash grab, than any kind of difficulty moderation (barring kaizo mario without using savepoints).

The good things I have to say about this game:
It's got a nice aesthetic (art and music)
It's got a funny forest cutscene the first time round
It's got cute animal pals and names, some of which you might even use
It's got lots of unlockable characters if you're willing to replay it over and over again
Can be played with friends to mitigate some of the difficulty. Just don't try to find an online game solo. It just doesn't work.
Bonus other game modes, in which the leaderboards are obviously topped with hackers. (ok, not really positive, but I had to fit it in somewhere)

Overall, I wouldn't really recommend this game unless you like arcade scrollers which tend to be punishing, repeat cutscenes, and you have a lot of time to kill. Or someone to share the misery with."

21718,"Very good game, i r8 8/8
"
21719,"So what, like, do you want me to give this game a recommend when it has a combat system this bad, just because it's a super popular game. Well of course, when I say the combat system is bad it will make no sense to most people and they'll just start screaming because they don't actually think about the game or how it functions at all. So if you actually do know how to dissect gameplay and mechanics, you're basically speaking a different language while still expressing negativity so they react to that negativity with infantile hatred without comprehending what you are saying.


Anyways yeah this game is just unarticulate button spamming but in a bad way. Because like many games like this, the player is punished for button mashing yet the game is about button mashing, and so the entire system hinges on random chance and not actual reaction or dexterity from the player.

First of all the combat system is extremely imbalanced. The most blatantly superior attack in the game is the default, weapon twirl heavy attack. It stacks damage way faster then any other player melee attack in the entire game, yet it is one of the first things they start off with. It is just mathematically the most effective thing to do over and over and over, it does more damage in way less time with no actual drawback. The other meta attack is spamming the airborne attacks, as they allow the player to juggle enemies while out of range of many enemy attacks while also moving around to in all make the risk of taking damage minimum. The game introduces new melee attacks, but they are generally all inferior to the stock heavy attack and mostly just serve to decrease your damage per second while spamming the buttons. The game features magic and range as possible options for combat yet ranged just straight up deals barely any damage at all and has a low firing speed so it's essentially useless when the game starts generating swarms that are constantly ontop of you. Meanwhile magic is somewhat useful but because like ranged, players can only shoot singular projectiles, the damage per second massively falls short of melee as melee is way faster yet has comparable damage. Plus, the animation for casting magic is longer then using melee so players are more likely to get stunned out of the animation or trade hits just to perform a spell that does comparable if not often worse damage then their melee. The main spells that are actually useful are the airborne ones, again because it helps the player avoid damage.

Like many two dimensional combat games, the combat itself is not balanced towards actually involving the players input when it comes to avoiding damage. The combat is all about mashing the buttons, not just because of the combination attacks but because the enemies are damage sponges so it takes mashing to kill them. Fine, it's not exactly exciting but there's nothing wrong with it either. The problem is, the player spends so much time locked in their attack animations while being constantly under threat that it is often impossible to avoid hits. Because the enemies will come up from behind, and attack you while you are attacking another and you can't stop it because you are locked in an animation. Sometimes they will just randomly stop being stunned by your attacks and hit back at you for some more unavoidable damage. Sometimes they shoot at you from a distance while you're locked in your animations. So what can you do.

Well you can block. But the block has a delay on activating, and can only activate after you have completely exited your attack animation. So the only times when blocking is possible is against low threat enemies and small groups that aren't constantly pressuring you. Otherwise, the game physically will not allow you to block in time for an enemy attack. They are hardly telegraphed in advance, the block is delayed, and the block can only be done when you have full cleared your animation. And so the developers designed a mechanic, which actually does not work in their game because the block is extremely slower then the actual combat system it is put into. It just does not work. Alternatively the player can stun enemies out of hitting them by swapping their attacks from side to side, but this only works against enemies trying to hit you with melee and only if they are slower then your transition animation from attacking on each sides. Finally, you can try changing layer to avoid them. This works, but only against certain enemy formations. The enemies are coded to hover around you, often raining projectiles on you, while some try to attack you with melee. And so changing layers only works if the enemies are spread out enough. If they are tightly together, changing layers won't work since they will just immediately pressure you again the moment you do and so you have no opening to actually attack.

The controls aren't very good either in the field of, having multiple actions tethered to the same button. Often you will perform certain attacks or actions because they are all connected to the same button but are triggered by certain requirements. So you are not fully in control of yourself while spamming. Also, because of this you will randomly be forced to perform certain attacks because those requirements were met while you were pushing the button to perform a different attack. And almost every time, the attack the game will make you use is less efficient then the one you were trying to use and so you will get hit for not being meta; despite you not having control over it.


The player taking damage in combat is almost exclusively based on the random chance of the player getting hit while locked in their attack combinations. The methods of avoiding damage work inconsistently or do not actually work at all, yet the enemies attack relentlessly and sometimes just straight up stunlock you for massive damage. You do not take damage because you as a player made a mistake, you take damage because somewhere in the flurry of button mashes some random mob poked you with their sword or jabbed you with an arrow. You can't physically avoid it, the combat is just not articulate enough. After the game reaches a certain point, the enemies are just too aggressive and too numerous for the slow methods of avoiding damage to consistently work anymore. The only way to effectively avoid damage then, is to just juggle the enemies so they can't actually attack or spam airborne attacks to make it harder to hit you. Otherwise, getting hurt is just a random occurrence which can be lessened by using min-max techniques.

Many of the bosses are overly simplified and just not very well designed, the beefy enemies are just unstoppable jokes unless you spam range or air attacks, foreground obstructions, the arenas are obscene and the ""humor"" is gross and often not actually humour it's just gross concepts.


The game has great production value, but considering the game is all about combat and the combat is just a spastic jumble of button pressing it's really not worth the time for a discriminating player."

21733,"This game is pretty good, and one from when i was younger, so its pretty good.
But, when taking off my nostalgia goggles, i see one, large, flaw.
The combat is a bit repetitive, so it can sometimes be a bit boring, but for $2.99 USD, Its well worth the price.
So if you like flash game like gameplay, somewhat crude jokes, people being chopped in half,
your dead enemies and allies being reanimated to kill you, and saving princesses, then yeah, its a pretty good buy.

21735,"While this game is super old I have to say that it withstands the test of time and continues to this day to be an extremely fun romp through every time I play it. This beat-um up side-scroller is ready to give you some tight controls and ridiculous combos and let you have at the world. The game doesn't waste time with its story, as it's as bland as a Mario game. But that's not a problem as the bulk of the fun comes from just beating the crap out of some baddies. To add on the the depth of this game, each knight has its own magic that they can utilize. Some is better than others but they're all super interesting to use. Some downsides I do have to mention is that while most of the bosses in the game are interesting in design, The fights themselves I truly never found all to fun. Some are cool, some are boring, and others are just bad. Speaking of bad bosses, don't get to hype for the final boss. While I'll admit this isn't my number one favorite game ever, but because of its length and difficulty, this is easily the game that I have played through and beaten the most. While I'm sure everyone at this point who wanted to play Castle Crashers has played it, I still wanted to sing the games praises as it is really good. 8/10"

21742,"years ago, when i played this game for the first time (it wasn't on steam) it was great. years later, i saw it in the steam store. i bought it, i had to. the nostalgia is amazing. the game is just as good as it was years ago. this game made my childhood what it is right now, a really good and nice memory, and replaying this gem, it made me feel the way i used to feel years ago. if you've played this game years ago, i definitly recommend it, and if not, i still recommend it. it's an action/adventure game with a lot of replay value. hopefully i was helpful, have a nice day!"
21743,"Gud
"
21744,Love the game hours of fun
21745,"Good game, especially buying on sale. Considered a must-have."
21746,An amazing Co-Op Game! Also perfect for playing alone in your room while you sit in the dark with chips stuck in your double chin like me!
21747,It was fun. I enjoyed it. Could use more story but still worth it.
21748,This Game is an absolute blaast with friends and when alone. Ready to play more
21749,DAMN. uh friend gave me game for free. so now i wanna be gay with him
21750,history lesson is good
21751,Yes
21752,"Excellent game, the graphics are amazing but simple so you can run this on a low end PC. The sound track is superb and fits very well with the game. 10/10!"
21753,"mmm yes, buy it"
21754,"I think castle crashers is one of the best game I ever played.  Thank you, Behemoth!  I just wish that there were more posters in the store."
21755,Extremely fun and adicive even though you play the story over and over its fun seeing all the new chariters and playering with diffrent stats and there are so many amazing glitchs once me and a friend got on top of theufo in that ufo level it was so weird and fun XD
21756,A fun 2D hack & slash game that can be played with a group of friends.
21757,Very fun and funny but too short of a game :(
21758,pretty gud. brings back memories
21759,Bayom
21760,"This is the best brawler on PC, and this is the best 4 player couch co-op experience on PC. Highly recommended."
21761,"Castle Crashers is absolutely fantastic! The cartoon style has been drawn beautifully and has loads of comedy!

I give Castle Crashers 10/10 

P.s where is the mobile version??"
21762,Good game! Get it or the patato will come. :(
21763,SO FREAKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
21764,Great classic game that has a lot of replay value. A lot of fun to play with friends.
21765,Very fun game to play with friends. Lots of great humor.
21766,"I didnt really like platformers or 2.5D hack and slash games, but I still found this pretty enjoyable. However, I got this game in a 4-pack bundle with some friends, so that really added to my experience with it. I never got around to completing it though, but I think thats less of the game and more of my personal preference. Nonetheless, it was a pretty nice run eventhough its not my preferred choice of game."
21767,Game destined to play with friends! Atleast one of them.
21768,"It is a fun side scroller, has fun fast paced gameplay and is fun with friends, i don't think it is worth the 15 dollars though, if you seem very interested in playing it get it, but if you want to see what it is wait for a sale, it does it often."
21769,4/10? But i recommend
21770,i'd get my ass kicked by a giant grey man again
21771,warning highly addictive hack n slash youve been warned
21772,I had fun playing it with friends! A really good game! Buy it if you want to have about ten hours of fun with your friends.
21773,"pretty fun with friends and going solo
6.9/10 with pink knight"
21774,"Fun modern-arcady game, loved playing this on my xbox 360 when i was little and i decided to buy this on pc and had as much fun as before"
21775,"Castle crashers is one of my favorite games lately, for several reasons. To begin with, it's a 2D style game (my favorite style), it has full controller support, great for beginners of controller gaming and a torture sentence for keyboard gamers. What's more, it has a good level of replayability, great to play with friends, from a distance or on the same couch, very good soundtrack (it doesn't cope with my taste, but it was nice to listen while playing) and long enough with a great storyline. Despite the fact this was a gift from a friend, I would gladly buy it in full price."
21776,"at first when i saw this game i didnt really like on how high the price was but since my friend papru also know as profox had persuaded me into buying this game and ive gota say it is so worth it, really good game!!!"
21777,"So much fun that I bought the DLC! Way more fun with friends, but the beat 'em up gameplay grind is enough for me to want to level up all of my knights. Great game."
21778,this game is amazing and fun!
21779,5/5. There are animals taking a dumb
21780,"Played this on XBOX360 way back in the day.  Fun, humorous and long.  Great cartoony style with the good old ""save the princess"" plot.  Lots of weapons, stats to rearrange, monsters to hack and characters to unlock.  Mix in multi-player and you have a winner!"
21781,This game is really good when you have a Macbook Air. I can play with my friends and it run really fluid
21782,its a great game!
21783,Good game
21784,:)
21785,"Old but gold. 

One of the best sidescrolling beatups I've played engaging but not too complicated. Wonderful colors humor here and there and it just feels solid.
If there is anyone around who has yet to try this it's truly wonderful and that much better if you can find a friend to play with."
21786,"I really enjoy playing this with my friends... but without any, i don't see a reason to play it."
21787,Pretty good
21788,"Battle block theatre is a video game ripoff of the first game ever made, Minecraft. In this game you fight notch and his army of skinheads as they try to steal your harem of hot babes. Undertake is a game where you can play as 4 different characters (or 5 if you count the dlc), play as the ever so infamous woody woodpecker, the charming and handsome Eraserhead baby,the quirky bonesaw is ready, and lastly undertale.
Enjoy incredible engaging gameplay like mashing the w key, or whatever it is for the pussies who use the controller, and getting slaves that you ironically call pets in an attempt to ridicule them and demean them from the once prestigious beings they were.
Alladin the last airbender also let's you level up in certain skills, but the only one that matters is defence, so you just focus on that unless you want to be a dicksucker who die every 5 seconds so your friends have to come pick you up and we end up losing every round.
Overall I'd reccomend this game, unless you have a dog, dogs are notorious for dying when I play video games, and this time was no different, I miss you benderdick cumbersnatch, you truly were this mans best friend, sorry I got so angry at Slade for not leveling up defence, in fact just blame Slade for your death, go haunt his house, and his brother too, both of em shall pay!"
21789,"Best game ever. Remember playing till my fingers bleed at the age of 10. Great game, had it back on the xbox 360. Heavily recommend it to anyone who is willing to get it. Best played with friends, bring's back great memories. Play it."
21790,"i buy castle crashers after 1 month it does not work black screen and it does not open
"
21791,"This game is absolutely amazing to play with friends, and I've played it across years, on and off. Its a very intense, moderate to fast-paced hack-n-slash adventure, and all the characters are such fun little critters, and some you will gaze upon in horror and you'll just say 'aw fuck, not this guy again'. 

AMAZING to play with friends, such a great adventure, with a ton of gameplay and the replayability is insane compared to other games now-adays. 

And the graphics look as though this game hasn't aged a bit!

8.5/10, would buy again"
21792,"Best Game Ever, Newgrounds best game of all.

"
21793,"Can be fun (with friends), but most of the time it's super hard to see your character because of all the stuff crammed in on screen.  Combine that with combat that feels pretty clunky and it just becomes too frustrating."
21794,"Loads of fun, whether with friends or solo."
21795,"good game. fun enjoyable 15 bucks well spent
"
21796,"Its pretty good, I just want another one."
21797,Never had more fun crashing a wedding than here.
21798,this is my favorite game
21799,THE FUCK I USED A STEAM LINK FOOR A XBOX CONTROLLER AND IT DOESNT WORK
21800,why the princess sound like shes getting it 6 feet deep?
21801,bem divertido para jogar com os amigos
21802,i didnt crash any castles dissapointed
21803,"Great game.

Reccomended : Controller"
21804,This game is awesome
21805,"THERE NEEDS TO BE A SEQUEL. I got this game on a Friday, started it up with some friends to see if it would be as fun as it sounded, and then proceeded to clock ten hours straight into it. This is such a fun, goofy little game that gets twenty times better when playing it with friends rather than by yourself. It is not perfect (the thieves in Insane Mode are very strong because of their bows) but it is one of the most fun couch co-op games I have ever played.

I play this game all the time with my friends and family, whether in the car on a long drive or just around my house or theirs. This game is awesome, and I seriously hope they make a new one or release a massive update"
21806,button mash the game
21807,"Has a great mix of everything.
[i] ..a cool playthrough, combat and simplistic handsome look


[b] 8/10 you might give it a try"
21808,più bug che anima
21809,cool
21810,i lined all my characters up and fucked em
21811,Killing your friends then kissing a princess
21812,Pink Knight my beloved
21813,"Great game. The graphics are neat, the story is good, and the gameplay is amazing. The access to the amount of characters and replayablility make this game great with friends and even random people online. The comedy isn't the greatest, though."
21814,"just buy it, you won't regret it"
21815,Fantastic game with some great music and gameplay and has awesome levels monsters and artwork
21816,Great game and great humor
21817,"When I first received this game, I thought it would be something similar to the games avaliable on newgrounds; somewhat good and overrated. But when I started playing, I got hooked on it and kept on. Castle crashers is one of my newfound favorites, and as a thot warrior and fellow knight of the thot round table, I am pleased.

Rating: 9/10"
21818,"I played this game with a couple of friends as a throwback to when we played it on the original XBox. It was still really fun, except not so good on a keyboard. But just grab a controller and it will be a good time."
21819,is so cool the castle crashers so fun to play i hope the thay make castle crashes 2 maybe. :)
21820,"Doesn't even worth even 10 cent believe me. Especially if you want to play with your frieds, just dont buy."
21821,This game is very fun. Lots of Characters and very creative.
21822,"This game is not a serious game at all. If you want something to button mash with four friends and get some comical relief in the meanwhile this game is what you want. You run through the game smashing stupid bosses playing funny mini-games and fighting your friends to kiss the princess'. It isn't a long game but it is fun for a few playthroughs. One of the best things about this game is they have a lot of cool characters making the replay value really good. Not to mention going back and finding the 800 weapons, and the 40 pets you missed."
21823,Is good. Yes. Very is good.
21824,"I'd recommend it to everybody who's in need of a good game, with good plot, and good gameplay. Every penny is worth it when spending it on this game, you can also play with friends too!"
21825,this game is D A N K
21826,"I didn't really like this game, It gave me no intreset"
21827,good
21828,"This game is cool. I call the orange princess tho, no homo"
21829,"Pooping animals, Knights, Princesses, and mindless killing. Excellent level design, a good combination of clever and crude humor, and great graphics/ art design."
21830,One of my favorite games
21831,кайф
21832,yes
21833,Nice Game.
21834,"Really fun game, especially for co-op. Tons of thinks to unlock and has lots of replay value. Good for casual play if you don't want to figure out what character is best with what skills etc etc."
21835,"It was fun in the beginning, but it gets repetitive."
21836,"This game is fun, but is better with multiplayer."
21837,"great humor and really great gameplay. If you're looking for a game to play with multiple people, this is one of the best. It can also be enjoyed alone."
21838,"The best way to kill an afternoon... or your friends. Castle Crashers is a cartoony, light hearted take on the beat-em-up formula and feels like a smoother, cuter Golden Axe, dripping with the ever-charming Newgrounds style The Behemoth is known for. Fun to tackle alone but made better with some buddies, the campaign of the game is just the right length with a difficulty curve that benefits genuine skill over grinding (but grinding still helps). Between it's unlockable skills, companion animals and several unlockable characters, Castle Crashers gives you plenty of reasons to come back for more."
21839,"The best arcade action game to play with friends ever. Just quick dirty fun, you can finish the game with friends in one 

sitting and have a total blast. There's lots of secrets and collectables to unlock, as well as a super difficult end game that's a 

fun challenge for hardcore players."
21840,"Great game and a lot fun to play with friends, playability is also nice. Kinda short though... But still great."
21841,"Best beat'em up game i've played
"
21842,good game
21843,"Ehdin pelaamaan pelejä tavallisesti vain viikonloppuisin ja tuolloinkin vain puolisen tuntia tai tunnin kerrallaan. Castle Crashers ei ole peli minulle. Peli ei ole erityisen hankala, mutta luottaa pelimekanismiin, jossa pelaajan pitää ensin hävitä voidakseen tietää miten voittaa. Sinällään tällainen yrityksen ja erehdyksen kautta tapahtuva oppiminen on mukavaa, mutta Castle Crashersin kohdalla tämä tarkoittaa aina tason aloittamista uudelleen, mikä tarkoittaa että viikottainen peliaikani kuluu enemmän saman toistamiseen kuin varsinaiseen uuden oppimiseen. Varmasti hauskaa jos aikaa pelata on paljon, mutta tällaiselle tavalliselle pelaajalle peli ei missään nimessä sovellu. Se on vain puuduttava C-64-ajoille kuuluvien pelimekaniikkojen takia. Sain niistä ihan tarpeeksi jo lapsena."
21844,"no living players online, crush while change resolution......

crush every 10mins, surely a ""crush Crasher"""
21845,9.8/10 - Only problem is volleyball.
21846,Super Fun Game!
21847,Amazing!
21848,great game
21849,"I play this game (offline) in my university a lot becuz my university has blocked the steam access....
This game is awesome.......  Doesn't need to worry about fps drop, framerate,and all the stupid next gen graphic settings.
And ya....this game has battle royale mode too...Although its only 4 players battle each other, I still call it as tiny battle royale XD"
21850,"we love this game!
"
21851,great game8/8 m8
21852,Bought the game on multiple patforms.
21853,"Excellent game. I played it on xbox 360, and that was the most fun ive ever had. When I found in on the xbox store in 2013 i bought it instantly. It looked so funny that I just had to own it. Now ,5 years later, I find my self enjoying the same 2011-2012 game again! Thanks to my wonderful friend that bought me this game, I can enjoy the old times of my gaming life style. Back in 2014 when I beat this game almost 5 times and was collecting every character, my xbox had ""too much dust in the memory unit"" so the game didnt work. So I had to save up enough money to be able to buy a new 360 but whenever I found out that it was on PC, I wanted to buy a PC and play it for myself on PC and recently I managed to scrape up enough money to be able to purchase myself the specie that I have now so I can play Castle Crashers like the old days of my gaming lifestyle which isn't a good lifestyle but still I love it and it's really fun to do every single day after school or work and play Castle Crashers whenever I can. Now in 2018 I have enough money to be able to buy myself a repair on my PC and peaceful it breaks down or it gets ""too much dust in the memory unit"" I can fix it, and now I find myself spending all my money on Steam cards to be able to buy myself cool skins in csgo or items that I want and game or DLCs that I don't need I think you guys should really try and save your money so then you can buy yourself steam cards every once in awhile not every day not every week but just sometimes not all the time if you don't want to you don't have to but I really recommend it it's really fun to just see what you can buy with just maybe $20 or maybe $10. If you only have $20 you can buy Castle Crashers and all the DLCs with just one singular is $20 steam gift card. And if you don't have enough money to be able to afford this game then ask your parents for an allowance or try and get yourself a job. If you can do any of these while I don't even know how you're alive, without a job you can't buy yourself house so you'll be homeless, but if you still live with your parents and then that is more understandable then being an adult that lives on their own that doesn't have a job. And if you can't convince your parents to buy you it wait until about Christmas time or your birthday and then just by yourself treat yourself to a games and then you have a lot of fun with the games you find for under $10 or under $20 in my case I got this game for free from one of my wonderful friends like I said which they are amazing I honestly praise them as Gods
"
21854,when im bored i sometimes play it and spend 2 to 3 hours on it
21855,"Do you remember newgrounds all those years ago?
Yeah. It's them but full of the AWESOME! <3
Another game that's better with friends! 

Fight enemies then fight eachother for a Princess's kiss!
Easy to pick up, lots of replay values. 
If you're a collector, LOTS to collect!"
21856,"Finally got all the achievements!
Castle crashers is a really fun game that involves strategy with awesome design and graphics to destory your enemies
I fine it fun to play multiplayer cause alot of funny things happen and its generally easier to go through bosses
This is so addicting I beat the boss 4, count it, 4 times, with different knights.
If you're gonna play this I say you should its really fun and the adventure is amazing."
21857,How the hell did I get 99 hours into this? WORTH IT
21858,"Killed my friend to make out with a princess

10/10 would play again"
21859,OH MY GOD MAGIC XDDD BEST GAME I love it
21860,"Único problema é a conexão do multiplayer, não compre pensando em jogar online."
21861,Awesome co-op game.
21862,one of the co op games you need to play before you die
21863,One of Best Coop Game <3 Sure will play again :)
21864,es un buen juego me justo la historia me gusto que sepueda jugar online de a 4 y en local pero lo que me gustaria que siguiera una secuela o una expansion con una nueva historia como el caballero oscuro o algo por el estilo
21865,Can see your legs.
21866,"You will have to play with your friends in this game. You don't have to, but thats the most fun. I haven't completed the game yet, not even close. And I've played for a lot of time."
21867,its good
21868,This Game IS WAY TO FRESH BUY IT!
21869,"This game is a great arcade beat em up with tons of replayabilty with multiple characters, its also co-op!"
21870,i think you guys will like this game if you enjoy repeatedly stomping on a dead guy's corpse after you MvC air combo'd them to their death
21871,"This game is the best! I used to play demo with my friend on box 360 all the time, and i just came across the a month er two ago, and the full game is awesome!! Good graphics, and a RPG mixed with all this humor? Its genuiss!"
21872,"fix the servers pls, it lags as hell"
21873,its no fun without friends
21874,This game is so fun and awesome I recommend it
21875,Best Behemoth game by far. Well animated and crafted. Not to mention it lays the groundwork of art that would be used in all future Behemoth games and projects.
21876,Gr8 game m8 10/10
21877,Gud game
21878,very fun  i love this game
21879,Fun for the whole family. Couch Co-Op 10/10.
21880,"Saw this online and I am taking it and running
Playing each game on my list for 1 hour then reviewing
Here is my review:

Fun with friends, I usedto have it as an XBLA game and play in the same room. Fun game with a lot of content"
21881,Great arcade style CO-OP game <- maybe im bad but hard to solo or even DUO. Reminds me of da SImpsons arcade game doe :) 8/10
21882,"The game shouldnt be called Castle Crashers... You crash Castles. It should be called ""Small men run around chopping people up Simulator!"""
21883,"i have played this since i was probley 6 years old on my xbox 360 and i played this game like a year ago on my old computer, after playing it it still lived up to its name if you read this i highly recommened you get this game"
21884,"Castle Crashers.
A 2015 remastered game, Old, yet fun!
I convince to people aren't my friend or is my friend to try this game, because
It sets up combos in your mind to remember each time you level up, and gives you ideas on how to beat bosses on their stages.
Additionally, their Minions as well.
So, if this review helped you out,
Come and get Castle Crashers!
It's around 10 dollars-ish or lower.
Not Expensive, just regular step cash. :p"
21885,Beat 'em up games don't get any better than this. Gameplay and Soundtrack are amazing!
21886,best game
21887,"Awesome game to play alone or with 3 friends!  Side scrolling beat em up action, with level ups and I'm guessing about 50 weapons?  Probably the biggest title I know of that game from the early days of Xbox Live.

Regualarly goes on sale for $2.99 by itself"
21888,"Simple

,, It´s fun "" :3"
21889,11/10 would air combo again
21890,"This game is awesome. I love the art of it, the music and sounds are great as well. This reminded me how much fun it was playing 4 player co-op hack and slash / beat up games back in the 90s. 

Its safe to say that Castle Crashers delivers on that experience with a game that keep things funny and interesting while still hanging on to nostalgia without compromising today´s gameplay experience. 

Highly recommended! I bought it when it released on the Xbox 360, I bought it again after I moved on to PC. 

Again, this game is so epic in its own way."
21891,"This game is a beautiful tribute to classic side scrolling beat 'em up action! made by the same clever and entertaining fellows behind Battleblock theater, It's fun but can be annoying, particularly when enemies magic or arrow spam keep you knocked down with no way of fighting back. But aside that, the fighting feels so fluent and awesome with lots of combos you can hit, the characters are unique and unlike anything I've ever seen. I DEFINITELY recommend buying this game, HOURS UPON HOURS of replay and different modes, as well as unlockable characters. You will never regret buying this game. Unless you're trying to beat the thieves arena... xD"
21892,A really fun game to play with your friends + the soundtracks are AWESOME AF!
21893,"This is game is great to play, alone or with friends! I would higly recommend this game as most computers can run it as well it can last you awhile. Its a beat them up and there are so many different characters you can play as. The game is kind of silly and chessy at times but its overall a great game!"
21894,"Really good game, Is fun and you gonna take a long time to complete it at 100%. And if you are bored, try to beat the arenas on crazy mode, is a real challenge"
21895,Xbox Nostalgia Jesus
21896,"great game, really funny i highly reccomend it to any fans of games such as castle crashers, battle block theatre or turn based combat games."
21897,"Ah, Castle Crashers.. Where do I even begin to describe this masterpiece of a fantasy side scrolling adventure? What makes this game about brightly color-coded knights fighting off multiple waves of enemies to rescue the 4 royal princesses so worthy of being praised endlessly by fans? Is it the diversity of enemies, each unique and fitting of the different environments you enter as the game progresses? Is it the fact that there are 31 characters to choose and play as while you unlock them? Is it the little tidbits of lore sprinkled into the background to explain the story as replacement for the absence of actual narration? Is it the animal orbs and new swords you can acquire if you scavenge through each level carefully enough?

For me, it's all of the above reasons. What's there NOT to love from this epic medieval knight adventure?

Castle Crashers is honestly such a fun 2D beat-em-up, action-packed story that's addictive as much as it is a 2000s gaming classic. Play locally, or play online. Play alone, or play with friends. Level up a low-leveled character in the normal story mode, or use the highest leveled ones to try your hand at Insane Mode. However you choose to play, I think that after a few levels of gameplay, you'll soon be able to see why so many love this Behemoth creation as much as they do. So if you think that this is the game for you, go armor up with your character of choice and get to stopping that Evil Wizard Mage!"
21898,good
21899,PERFECT 1:0/10
21900,"Awsome gameplay, awsome story ... 
11/10"
21901,"fun game great fun
"
21902,This proved that the beat them up styled games still had a lot to say
21903,doesn't work very well without a controller
21904,fun in multiplayer but can get boring
21905,"I'd say this is a fun game but, it does get a bit tedious at times (sand castle ball game) and while being a great rpg game it lacks a long story. The story can be finished in 4-6 hours and it will be the best 4-6 hours of your life!!"
21906,AWESOME!!!!!
21907,good
21908,Great game and very fun. Mostly boring without friends but it's okay. Fine for children above 7. Little bit of blood and decapitation but its cartoons and you'll see it's a okay game as you play through. Being completely honest Lego Batman 3 is more graphic then this game.
21909,9/10 Amazing gameplay! And fun references!
21910,very fun with friends
21911,"It's fun and good to play with friends
"
21912,Really funny dialog fun gameplay easy to use perfect
21913,hurts my hands... but i love it :)
21914,"So I got this game originally on Xbox 360 and had some great times playing with my brother and mother (My father was not into gaming).
We had done countless arenas, and beaten the story multiple times just for the fun of it.
Anyways, heres your review! (Please note that I am not a curator and some things are pretty opinionated)

CONTROLS: 10/10
STORY: 10/10
REPLAYABILITY: 7/10 (STORY) 8/10 (OTHER MODES)
GRAPHICS: 9/10 (I was having some weird stuff going on in the background, the scene changes/slides. Other players might know what I'm talking about)
FUN FOR SIZE: 10/10
SKILLS TREE/MECHANICS: 9/10
GAMEPLAY: 9/10 (Those archers and magic CAN get quite annoying)

::OVERALL SCORE::
9/10

Overall Castle Crashers is a great, simple, and amazingly fun arcade game that brings fun to everyone in the family, well, most everyone...

Hope this review helped you somehow!"

21920,goat game
21921,Bought this after playing it for countless hours on my Xbox back in the day. Did not disappoint.
21922,Castle Crashers is fantastic to play with friends but absolutely terrible to play singleplayer. Buy a second copy for a friend if you buy it and wait for a sale because there is absolutely not $15 worth of content in this barebones arcade beat em up.
21923,Definitely one of my favorite side scroller games. 10/10 would rescue princess again.
21924,"17/10 love it. i have raged SO HARD.




and i like that."
21925,"Such an awesome experience, it's remarkable. The game is simple yet so beatiful, crazy/silly and appealing. It's definetly worth at least a try."
21926,"Entertaining only with friends. Even so, the gameplay and fighting is pretty boring. Sure, it has unique bosses and stages but the fighting does not feel very fluid at all."
21927,I enjoy playing the smashing game because i can test my keyboard
21928,"This game is a barrel of fun, with a group of friends! Not My personally favorite but I still enjoyed it due to the stupid humor and truck loads of items to choose from, to equip to your knight."
21929,"bubby did it
"
21930,Liked playing my first run but i couldn't get myself to start a new game with a new character
21931,Verry Good game to play with friends
21932,Si asta
21933,The Best Game
21934,"Fun, funny and interesting. everything you want from this kind of game
very recommended!!!"
21935,"Pretty fun game , nice story :-D  and funny ending <3 ."
21936,I love this game! As soon as I got it I could not stop playing! I fiinished the game quickly but I love the Insane Mode feature that allows you to restart the game with harder enemies so I never get bored with it. I also like how you can go solo or fight with friends. I recommend this game to anyone who loves slashing through enemies while continuously getting more powerful.
21937,The game is fantastic in multiplayer
21938,"Castle Crashers is a simple concept gone crazy. Overcome hair trolls, bear cultists, literal demons, and more, to save the land. Castle Crashers is a side scrolling beat-‘em-up, like golden axe. It can sometimes be difficult to tell vertical alignment in busier environments, but overall, it’s a fun combo-oriented affair of running, slicing, and juggling your way through waves of enemies as you traverse the humorous and charming cartoon world, drenched with the nostalgic Newgrounds style of animation, music, and more. If you were ever a part of that culture, you’ll feel right at home in Castle Crashers. The back-off-barbarian minigame is honestly a lot of fun on its own, and the main game can be played by up to 4 people locally or online. An ultimate in indie co-op, and a solid single player adventure to boot, Castle Crashers has a lot to offer."
21939,Amazing game although wait for it when it goes on sale. Definitely worth it then.
21940,"castle crashers is good but insane mode is really hard
"
21941,si
21942,why is there no sounds?! but the games is amazing and somewhat rage enducing
21943,Great for play solo and with friends. I highly recommend.
21944,"Great game. I've played it for 5 years. I've recently gotten back into it, I'm going for all characters lvl 80+ atleast and have beaten hardcore. Then I will either get really bored of the game or help out people. It's the only beat 'em up game that I've played. I wish they would make a second one or add onto the first. It would be nice to get to lvl 100 or even 150. But that's beyond me. 


Basically, I love this game and I've played it since I was 6 or 7.
10/10 would juggle again"
21945,The best game i have played ever lol
21946,"Castle crashers is made for anyone. 
This game is so much fun to play alone or with friends. I have to recommend it to everyone.
Awesome gameplay, interesting art, and co-op!

10/10 so much fun for everyone"
21947,Good game to play through with friends
21948,very good
21949,"Good game, but you will get bored after while"
21950,"This is a really good game, i recommend for playing it with friends. It's more fun!"
21951,Really Fun Co-op Game
21952,very good please buy
21953,A
21954,"A throwback to the classic beat em' ups of years long past,playing single player or multiplayer(strongly Recommended) is a blast,and the loads of unlockable characters,ally pets and weapons will keep you entertained for a great long while."
21955,if it was like papa johns but in a video game
21956,Fun Game to play with friends :D ! The Story is so funny XD !
21957,"I'd got to say that CASTLE CRASHERS is the best indie game ever! I played it on Xbox 360 before back in 2009 and got all levels to 99. Well, with the Xbox 360, all the characters you would get for free in insane mode such as the cult, Necromancer and more, you'd have to pay money. but the ones that are free on the XBOX 360, cost $0.99. anyway, I think that Castle Crashers is worth getting, there is a demo to so...

9/10 rating
Cost: $14.99 (Regular price.)
DLC cost altogether: $1.98"
21958,Awesome game. If you like classic beat em ups you will love this.
21959,"this game was great on the xbox 6 years ago and its great today
"
21960,"I would highly recommend this game to anywone who's into the sort of gameplay you can see in the trailer, ir's lots of fun, it's a really neat visual story, and the replayability is nearly endless, with a huge cast of unlockable characters. It's best enjoyed, in my personal opinion, with friends, and it supports local coop as well, so you'll never have to play alone, as long as you have a second controller."
21961,I feel sorry for those who dont own this. (Unless you hate side-scroller beat em ups than I will understand)
21962,haha the bear pooped himself
21963,I love this game i recommend it if you want some fun!
21964,"If You Read this Just Know, I'm a Pink Fairy Tale Rainbow Spewing Teddy bear Bomb Tossing Lilipop Maniac Well Not In Real Life But in this Game it's True.

That's Enough Said Right, Play It."
21965,"This was a great game that made me wanna go back to even after beating the game because of how funny the bosses are and how online co-op was in this game that made me wanna get it. The only problem is, not much people are playing online anymore. It's a good game to play with friends or alone. It's a game for pros (if you know what I'm talking about) and for newbs. There's so many characters to choose and play as and a bunch of weapons and pets to pick. If you like plushy animals, then you'll like the pets in this game. Only thing I'm not a fan of is, they got rid of the [b]All you can Quaff[/b] mini game. I know you're suppose to like mash the buttons as fast as possible but to me, it was a funny and great to play with friends that's playing for fun and not thinking competitively. They should've just added the game to the list in the mini games instead of just replacing it, like there's not much mini games in the first place, that way there would've been more content than just keeping the same amount of content. Hopefully they'll do something to bring back that All you can Quaff but also keep [b]Back Off Barbarians[/b], they're both pretty good games in different ways."
21966,fun for the whole family
21967,Behemoth... Give me CC2...
21968,Good Game
21969,"I get knocked down
I won't get up again
because the bow always keeps me down."
21970,"There are very few local co-op games left for PC that are quite as fun as this. I bought it so that my girlfriend could play a game with me and we absolutely fell in love with it.

10/10"
21971,"Really good playback and the insane mode is thrilling and action packed. It features a good story line and a good ending even though not a single word gets spoken through the entire game.
"
21972,Timeless
21973,"KNIGHT FRIEND IS DEAD!

is good."
21974,"Quick review: 3

21977,"I remeber when I was a little kid I'd watch my older brothers play this game, 3 years later  I played for myself, and now I play it again. I have to say, this game is amazing. I love so many things about it that I dont even think I can fit it in this comment section! If you're lookin for a funny, exciting, challanging, and rewarding game, then this is for you! Grab a friend and enjoy multi-player or even fight to the death with said friend! I really wish this game was more popular, but the gamegrumps played it so I guess its up there. I reccomend buying this game, its worth the 15 bucks!"
21978,"Great game, especelly if you play it with friends.
It has a lot of bosses, some of them funny. Realy liked the artstyle.
The multiplayer is buggy and dead, better play it localy.

I give it 10/10"
21979,this is a good game to play with friends since this is a hard game but the one other thing is you can get rid of the gore if you dont like that kind of stuff.
21980,"This game is alittle short for my me but it is an all time classic. Would recommend playing with friends. Music 10/10, gameplay 8/10 and story 10/10. My favorite game from my childhood."
21981,"If you guys used to play that on Xbox 360 and you want to buy it on Steam, that's up to you."
21982,"Pretty cool game.
I will get that pink knight DLC

UPDATE: I got my DLC"
21983,Perfect with Friends so you don't die automatically
21984,Really fun I got it for free (via somebody getting it for me) I would understand kind of if you hated it honestly I think people should actually try it out before they start hating it.
21985,"this game is so good ! I love playing it with my dogs and family, it’s so good. Oh my god, my mom is coming, I have to g"

22007,"Thi sgame is one of the best games that I havev on my PC, because it's fun, addicting and great to play multi/solo player."
22008,I love this game! I have never made so much progress in a week after I bought it. I recomend buying it. It is worth it. I also love it because it has an easter egg from one of the other games the comapany created. (One of the knights aka Hattie).
22009,Such a great beat em up! worth playing through a billion times!

A bit challenging at times."
22017,"if you can, get your friend to kiss the princess at the very end of the game lol they'll love it"
22018,"Man, I had such fun playing this with my friends. I remember our failures like it was yesterday. I picked the blue knight (he's actually the worst), Adam picked the red knight (the strongest one), and QaQaQaQayum picking the low-level orange knight (he joined in the first quarter of our playthrough. It was good times smacking and juggling enemies around easily. There was that time when we sacrificed each other for the beefy enemies that annihilated anyone in their path. There was that other time when a deer flew to the moon by shitting itself. There was that one time where we groaned every time we died to the fucking Necromancer [b] WHO KEEPS SPAWNING ENEMIES AND BEEFY ENEMIES THAT ALWAYS KILL US! [B]

0/10. Is a horribel gam."
22019,is good

"
22030,"I cannot express my joy enough when playing this game, so ill make it short; its fun, it doesnt require much, it offers a lot, the pets are adorable, the bosses are fun (except the corn...seriously f*** that guy), leveling system is easy to understand so builds are straightfoward, although the weapons all act the same there is a large insentive to collect them all....just get the gsme if you're thinking sbout it, just ensure youre packing a controller"
22031,"good game, got it from a friend but would absolutely get for myself if able"
22032,One of the best co-op games out there.
22033,"[h1] The perfect co-op game for friends [/h1] 

Side Scroll Beat Em' Up Games aren't a type of game that is developed anymore. Sadly, all the great beat em' ups I've played are rather old and dated. Castle Crashers on the other hand is by far one of the best in its genre for good reason. It may be ~10+ years old but this game is really polished. This review is heavily influenced by nostalgia however since I played this game as a kid on the Xbox 360. 

Castle Crashers is a 4-player co-op beat em' up where the objective is to rescue the princesses from the bad guys. Simple story but story is not where this game shines. Kill enemies, kill the boss, save the princess. Super Generic. The game truly shines in the multiplayer aspect. You can't play this game without friends - it's too boring. The games enjoyment stems straight from the interaction you have with everyone playing with you. As a game meant to be played with others, Behemoth truly did an amazing job at creating this effect.

The game itself consists of ~36 levels and is rather short. Despite that however, there's a lot of content for completionists in the form of unlocking all the weapons, pets and even another difficulty to play the game in. To say Castle Crashers has little content is absurd. Castle Crashers also consists of a large cast of characters all with unique and different styles of gameplay making replayability never boring or tiresome. 

The soundtrack in this game is phenomonal. There is never a dull track and every song fits the environment perfectly. Hell, I sometimes re-listen to the soundtrack because it's so amazing. It could be nostalgia speaking, but Castle Crashers music is something I could never forget.  

Visually, this game is great. Its nice vivd colours along with the cartoony feel make this game really pop out and makes it feel less serious. For a game that is ~10 years old, it looks amazing and almost doesn't look it's that old. At the end of the day, this game is all about fun and the visuals reflect that.

The one thing I despise in this game is the online multiplayer feature. Playing LAN is absolutley amazing, have a few friends over and playing an amazing beat em' up is bliss. Online however, gets laggier the more people are playing. It could just be me and my shit internet but everyone also experiences the same lag. Also on a side note, never play this game with randoms. It's not a fun time. People could be hacking or be playing with characters at the max level. That itself is not fun - there is no fun in cheaitng your way through everything. 

If you have already played Castle Crashers and want another similar game to play, I'd recommend Scott Pilgram vs The World. The chances of you finding that game nowadays is slim, so if that isn't an option, play Battleblock Theater. Both games developed by Behemoth and are meant to be pure fun and nonsense."
22034,me like cuz haze hatty the best charater in my pinyan
22035,Castle Crashers je velmi dobrá kooperativní hra jak na local mod tak na split.takže jestli hledáte neˇjakou kooperativní hru pro 2 až 4 hráče tak doporučuju.
22036,Yea its good
22037,"Castle Crashers is overwhelmingly charming. Every time you're like ""I wonder if I can do that?"", you can. The developers clearly loved making this game, and you'll love playing it with your friends."
22038,"The green knight has poison meaning that it is automatically my favourite.

10/10"
22039,Solid game. Really dorky. Gotta love the princesses.
22040,"Fun until you get stuck on a level of high health/resistance enemies... Gameplay is good, music is good and art is fantastic! Highly reccommended."
22041,its like street fighter but you can go up
22042,Very good gam
22043,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!! i love this game because of how creative it is!
22044,5/5 awesome best game i have ever played worth 15 bucks buy for friend to super fun with 2+ PLAYERS
22045,This game is purely on lvs and as long as you farm you can win easily not very fun
22046,Progress isn't saved properly
22047,"Castle Crashers is a classic indie game that still to this date is one of the best side scroller/beat 'em up style games out there.  Set in a fantasy world, the 2D art style is gorgeous and the world is full of color and detail.  Each level is very unique and presents loads of new enemies and challenging bosses.  The RPG elements provides enough depth and allows for more personalization of your gameplay style whether it be strength, magic, defense, or speed.  The controls are very simple and easy to learn, which makes this a casual game anyone can pick up and have fun.  There are tons of cool weapons to collect, characters to unlock, and secrets to find, which makes this game highly replayable. The coop and multiplayer is a blast and is highly suggested over playing solo.  This game is full of comedy and it will defintely have you laugh and smile.  Cute and bubbly but also gorey and violent, Castle Crashers is a blast from start to finish. This game is so easy to pick up and so hard to put down, and is truly one everyone can enjoy.

22049,"Super fun, mindless fighting game.

love the developers, always making games fun and funny"
22050,just platy it
22051,Genuinely one of my favorite beat em ups ever. This game is the only in its genre that I have replayed several times. Most of these I get bored of fast but this game has solid enough level design and progression that it keeps me playing. Not to mention the artstyle is impeccable and the soundtrack is honestly cum inducing. I seriously can't recommend this game enough on sale or not it's worth it.
22052,Lol bird poops in game
22053,This game takes me back to the good old days. where video games were at they're prime years. I hope newer games get as good as this one. 11/10
22054,"Very well built and fun game
very recomended especially with controllers"
22055,Do you have friends?! Do you like to play beat-em-ups with your friends? GOOD NEWS. This game is for you.
22056,Kingdom Destroy

Português: 

Castle Crashers para mim é a definição de ""divertido"". É um Beat´em Up onde tu(e provalvemente mais 3 estarolas) vão combatendo ondas de inimigos, em vários níveis, ao mesmo tempo que vocês vão desbloqueando um mapa inteiro, tudo isto como objetivo, salvar as vossas gajas e o vosso reino. Além de Beat´em Up, também tem alguns elementos de RPG, tens a opção de melhorar atributos como o teu poder físico ou mágico por exemplo, podes comprar itens para te ajudar na jornada, bichinhos de estimação que te dão habilidades únicas e armas do catano. Ao início podes escolher 4 personagens mas ao longo dos tempos vais desbloqueando cada vez mais personagens para usar(incluindo o Pink Knight que é o melhor de todos). É um jogo que te satisfaz bastante, o combate é extremamente entusiasmante, dando-te liberdade para fazeres vários tipos de combos, o desafio está lá, a art style é linda e a música épica combina com a temática do jogo apesar de ter um humor bastante javardo xD Chama três amigos teus e convence-os a jogar a isto, não só vocês tem a campanha, como vocês tem o modo Arena e o ""Back Off Barbarian"" que é divertido para caraças! Os desenvolvedores merecem uns parabéns :)

English:

Castle Crashers is the definition of fun. It´s a Beat´em Up where you(and probably other 3 dorks) fight waves of enemies, going through the many levels, unlocking a whole map with the objetive of saving your chicks and your kingdom. Besides being a Beat´em Up, it also has some RPG elements, you can upgrade your skills like physical or magic damage for example, you can buy items to help you on your journey, pets that has unique abilities and awesome weapons. At first, you can pick up to 4 characters but eventually you start to unlock more of them(like the Pink Knight that´s the best one) It´s a really satisfying game, the combat is extremely engaging, giving you freedom to do a lot of different combos, the challenge is there, the art style is beautiful and the epic music really fits with the theme, even though it has a lot of dirty humour xD Call 3 friends of yours and go play this game, not only you have the Campaign Mode, but you also have Arena and ""Back Off Barbarian"" mode which is fun as hell. Congratulations to the developers! :)"
22073,"Fun with friend, other wise it is kind of boring."
22074,It's really good
22075,"A game that's fun and silly


This game is really fun, and pretty silly. One time i got 3 other people to play with me and we beat the final boss with brocoli
sword. This game is really cartoony, but my only complaint is that it gets a little hard for me in some parts of the game.
To me this game i like a 4/5 (in my opinion)"
22076,"Jogo muito bom pra se divertir, com gráficos divertidos e jogabilidade muito boa com o controle do xbox. Recomendado."
22077,The community still hold this wonderful masterpiece that is of a game
22078,I'm having fun.
22079,"If you're looking for great COOP, especially couch coop with Xbox controllers this is amazing. Get it now! DLC is fun too."
22080,Tornado
22081,"9/10. a lot of fun with friends. Awsome story and cute graphics. I like it. 
buy it :D"
22082,Great fun with friends
22083,Игра огонь!
22084,"Eh
"
22085,"Amazing game, solo or with a few mates, not a whole lot of replayability unless you give it some time between campaign runs. I myself have played through at least 3 or 4 times at seperate Lans. Epic game for the price you pay"
22086,intense
22087,my friend forced me to buy this. Great if you want to spend your time in and unlock some cool characters. also gud game
22088,"Castle Crashers is incrediably fun as well as being incredibly challenging. Even though the game has a hard enough difficulty to keep you from easily breezing through, you never feel frusterated to the point of quiting. This game is also incrediablly fun with friends but is still fun to play by yourself."
22089,not crashing
22090,"Fun game with friends. But only for like 8 hours, after that there is nothing to do."
22091,Very funny. 4 Player couch-coop is great with Steam-Link. Awesome!
22092,good i say u
22093,top notch highly recommended
22094,"Game is fun for a week and then it gets boring really fast.

This games combat is less intuitive than playing Pyro with a Phlogistinator.
W+M1? Try X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y
The combat is so retarded that it literally looks like a bunch of extra chromosomes.

I guess if you have some friends or family over for the weekend, this is something you can enjoy with them if you have some USB xbox controllers and you have nothing else to play."
22095,"Design of Castle Crashers creates an immersive, charming realm with dark sensibilities. The art style contributes a lot to the oddity of the creatures. Ash-covered housing tracts have attitude. A vicious corncob boss looks like it could eat you whole. Verdant fields are full of blossoming roses that exceed both expectation and imagination. Truly, the world of Castle Crashers is a bizarre world, but one that is so much fun to play in that just looking at the variety of environments in the game."
22096,"Not much to say

Good game to play alone
Better to play with friends
Nice hidden secrets

9/10 
Fun but may desync in multiplayer experience"
22097,"This game is funny and a Pure FUN :).

very pleasing aesthetics, art is amazing!.
If you loved Double dragon this one is even better.
Characters and story are well made, gameplay is top notch.
every time you think it can't surprise you any more it does again and again.

This game is best played with friends, Solo Gameplay is nice but it really shines when played with someone.
one of of the best games i have ever bought on steam.

Very recommended ^_^

A small word to developers : Please make more games like this ""_^_^_"""
22098,"Honestly one of the most fun, light hearted games I’ve played."
22099,this game rulezzzzz
22100,"it rules
"
22101,Had this on Xbox 360 and now I have it on PC. I still enjoy this game til this day! Classic — [Follow Me] twitch.tv/orriononline
22102,Played this a few years back. I still love it! Cute game with a great ending.
22103,"11/10 game like seriosley guys.
WHAT THE FRICK"
22104,"I've played too many hours on Xbox 360. I figured I'd give it another go on Steam.

This game is wacky and great. Definitely holds a place among the greats of the indie reneissance of the late 2000s."
22105,"Castle Crashers, Is fucking epic and an amazing time to play through with and without a friend (Mostly better with a friend)

If I would have to rate Castle Crashers out of 10 it would be 9 Red Knights / 10.

Don't get me wrong the game is truely great but I think it is way better to play through with a friend so they get to expirence a story as riduculous and hard as this one.

Pros:
- Many weapons to collect (Most hidden and have to use certain pets to find them.)
- A leveling system up to 99
- An upgrating skill system (To make your characters more and more badass)
- Fun addictive gameplay 

-------------------------------------------
CONS?!
- Short Campagin ranging from 3 - 8 hours long (for each character)
- A more difficult mode locked behind you to first beat the game to unlock it

If you can get this game for free or less than $15 I would suggest that you take it."

22108,"It's good, I like the artstyle and having played this game in both the Xbox 360 and PC versions, I still find myself coming back to this game, it's great to play with friends, and I never cease to find extra cool things and enjoyment from this game."

22111,"is,is gud gome"
22112,crashed many castles in during my time but not all the fellas could play
22113,Just buy it i know you want it XD
22114,"I've been a fan of Castle Crashers for years. I had an old review of this game, too, so I'll mostly stick with the same skeleton of that with a few revisions.

This game is neither easy or difficult to master, but it is CERTAINLY not for the faint of heart (Insane mode especially). The graphics are very pleasing to the eyes, but being a cartoon-y game, of course everyone can't be happy. But hey, fantasy violence makes up for it I suppose!

The music of this game doesn't really compare to a lot of others, but that isn't to say it's bad. It certainly fit the style of the game, and it may even be to the point where I wouldn't recommend muting it and putting something else on in the background.

Insane mode is EXTREMELY challenging, but other than that this game is quite casual. The only problem I've found is that it's almost impossible to get all of the achievements for this game due to the lack of online players, which is really unfortunate because I love this game and I would have been so happy to be able to 100% all of the achievements."
22115,fun game
22116,itsa gud gam
22117,cool
22118,"There are not enough words to describe how much I love this game. 
The soundtrack is phenomonal and fits the themes of the game well. The ""story' and characters are charming and cute. The leveling up system and choosing where you want your exp points to go to is also a really nice touch also. If you want a very good beat em' up with lots of weapons and tons of characters this game is for you.

Honestly, the only ""problem' I have with the game is the online play. It's a pretty old game so finding people who still play it is bound to be hard in the online mode. I reccomend going on the Behemoth discord if you want to try and find people to play with (but even that's hard to do there lol)."
22119,"This game is just awesome,must buy it when it sale :DDDD"
22120,"This game is fun to play! I recommend this game if you like Beat em' Up games. It lasts for a good amount of time and the 2D animation style is fun to glare at. The game is easy, so you won't see yourself struggle much."
22121,"the one time my friend managed to beat me he got the clown woman,
just like real life."
22122,"AHH MAYY ZZ ING

Despite the deceptively simple combat mechanics, Castle Crashers utilises its brilliant art design and responsive controls to create an engaging and addictive gameplay experience. 

The boss design is interesting and unique, the storytelling is quirky and captivating, and me and my girlfriend finished the entire game in one sitting (on normal difficulty).

Highly recommend for those looking for a couch co-op fiesta. 9/10, coulda been longer."
22123,"eh, was fun with friends for the first few hours ig."
22124,Good co-op game for friends on long distance . Good idea and concept of game . Conclusion 5/10
22125,good
22126,"I'm so happy I got this game when it went on sale!
I sold some skins from csgo to buy it for 3.50$ (CAD)"
22127,"Good game. A++++ but it only takes about 20 hours to complete with a couple of friends. This game is great, it is worth 15 dollars and even better when it goes on sale because it goes onsale a lot and gets to 3 bucks."
22128,"I bought this this game as soon as I saw it on Steam because Castle Crashers is true nostalgia to me. I love the bosses, gameplay, and graphics. There is a problem where the game does not save and I lose my progress. I do recomend this game though."
22129,"I just wish I didnt have to beat the industrial castle on insane to get the necromancer.

Because necromancer is the best.

Dont deny it.

But seriously it's a great game with a bunch of refrences like the clockwork carrot from that newgrounds animation.
Although the thief arena is the most infuriating thing on the planet at a low level its always fun being the bad guy once you beat it and unlock the thief or barbarian or icekimo or just being a peasant.

Make the final clown a playable caracter."
22130,"This game was the best one but when both have no vertical sync it causes them in different places, also Public onlines are messed up"
22131,"This game is a sword slashing, fun with friends, RPG game. Unique bosses, funny moments, and cartoony graphics will keep you enertained for 28.4 hours."
22132,Fun but a little repetive but the background art and bosses are definatly unique.
22133,"A fun game to play in multiplayer and challenging game in singleplayer.

WORTH IT!"
22134,"Fun to play with friends. Played as 3 players, kicked ass, laughed a bunch.
Have no clue about online co-op, but didn't buy it for that.
Good to have some drinks then slash enemies."
22135,FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
22136,"Amazing shared screen/co-op game to play with friends. I had so many laughs while playing, love the story and i recommend to play with controller rather then keyboard. Overall 10/10 would play again"
22137,Great fun better to play with freinds!
22138,"Nice game for the multiplayer freature , otherwise it's pretty boring to go alone.

"
22139,11/10
22140,its like scott pilgrim but for nobles
22141,"I'm pretty sure the creator of Newgrounds made this, so yeah. Also, I love the style! (◠‿◠)"
22142,Great game! I absolutely love the story and all the funny and cute characters! I sat down and finished this game around 21 times on my xbox and have down all the characters. I found the steam edition and love it all the same! It can be a bit laggy when playing online multiplayer when compared to Xbox but its nothing major that effected me too much. There is a significant difficultly spike if you're rushing the game though and will be forced to replay a couple of levels in order to meet a certain level and move on. Also levels can be kinda boring when by yourself. So grab some friends and enjoy this amazing game!!!
22143,"Super fun game, especially if you have friends to play it with. Hey, Red Knight = best knight."
22144,"A pretty great Beat-Em-Up, even more fun with friends."
22145,"Read Our Review: https://enomview.com/2018/01/20/castle-crashers-review/

Your homeland is in grave peril! Your king needs your valiance! Take up your weapon and free the ladies of the land from the clutches of our sworn enemies! Destroy any that stand in the way of your might and valor! And look damn good while doing it!

Very little is needed to be said about the awesomeness of Castle Crashers, but sit down, we’re going to talk about it anyway! You are a knight whose sole duty is to repel the enemy and get your lady loves back, as they were kidnapped from the castle.

While I will say that using the keyboard is not a good idea, using the controller is just as fluid as any other game you could ever find made from an AAA manufacturer. The controls are responsive, reliable and so very easy to learn by yourself. Still, it doesn’t care how easy it is to learn, the game still prompts you when you can use combos and what not while you play without stopping the game or halting your progress.

The colors and artwork are so very simple, but still beautiful to look at. The cartoony quality is charming and the humor matches it perfectly! While the humor can be a little juvenile at times, it still is worth noting that it can also be especially witty.

As for the difficulty, that’s probably the best part. It may not be considered extremely hard because there is a marvellous level up system that keeps the game progressing along with you, while not making the levels too easy for your character. There is no steep learning curve and you find yourself wanting to progress as long as you can! You’re not stopped between levels and forced to go to the map screen simply to select the next level on the list. No, you are simply brought to the map screen for the important decisions and crossroads.

Combat! Smash your enemies’ faces in! No, seriously, you just push the buttons and dodge left to right, smashing your enemies to bits while you gain up levels, dodge and block their attacks, and kill them! It may sound repetitive, and in some ways it is, but it never feels stale because it’s always moving. You can’t really call this a pure beat’em up because it also has RPG elements, but it still feels like it belongs in the arcade where you can feed it a million quarters to keep it going.

That’s not the case, though. We are lucky enough to find this simple gem of an indie classic pretty much wherever games are sold for some pretty good prices. So, if you were looking for a beat’em up to relieve some stress, look no further! This will sate your hunger for blood and carnage! The boss battles will challenge you, but not to the level of absolute ragequit mode, you can learn their patterns and defeat them with your own skill, should ye be worthy!

Now go, hero! The homeland is counting on you! Slay thy enemies and drink thy water.

EnomView Score: 10 out of 10"

22152,"A really fun modern beat em up in the same vain as Turtles in Time and Golden Axe with a lot more raunchy humor. I mean, you ride on the back of a deer who shits so hard he flies. That sound like your thing? Then this game's for you."

22154,Really fun game you should buy it it is REALLY FUN

22158,"great fun with friends. 100x better if you have a controller.

22159,Favorite game when i had this on the xbox. Glad I can experience it again on a computer!
22160,Good game also a dead game
22161,"A classic, get a few friends together when playing this one."
22162,Love this game! It is short and a little strange but you cannot beat this button smasher for the price and replayability. I have replayed this game a lot with friends. Just enough poop humor to keep you giggling between levels.
22163,"This game boasts excellent beat-'em-up gameplay with the characteristic Behemoth coat of paint.  The main focus of the game is its robust single player campaign/storyline, although you can play this with your friends as well."
22164,"Really fun game! You can connect 2 to 4 joysticks on ONE COMPUTER!!! THAT is insane! Oh yeah, there is an insane mode when you beat the game in normal. It's really hard and tricky and you will die a lot, but will, at the end, have fun ;)"
22165,I play this game for a living
22166,"I started just a few hours ago, and I love this game already. It feels awesome to beat down everyone and everything. I LOVE IT"
22167,Pretty Solid Game with a charming art style and a funny story. It is also amazing to play with friends. I would give it a 8/10
22168,"best game ever

22169,funny but short game
22170,good game
22171,Great game
22172,"This is a Damn awesome game, i first played it on XBOX after a party when i was still wasted and almost broke a rib laughing at it. 10/10"
22173,Aw this game bring's it all back staying up on late Nights with Family Playing this it's Great Game even tho there's no Probane. 8/10
22174,"This game is so fun to play with friends, just make sure you pick a good character! It affects how you like the game. My first character was horrible, so my initial thought was that this game sucked, but I switched characters and I love it now!

Pros:
- Soundtrack
- Fun with friends (if you have those, I know I struggle too)
- Addicting
- Replayability is great
- Many characters with different pros/cons
- Sandwiches full of steroids
- Tons of bosses to blame your friends for messing up

Cons:
- How many poop jokes there are

Overall, 9.8/10 from me :)"
22175,Spam your controller to win! (Very great experience)
22176,"Muito Bom!
Final bem engraçado.

Compre apenas se tiver amigos."
22177,güzel
22178,Leveling up with friends is  enjoyable.
22179,"This game is amazing I just got it a couple of weeks ago and it's still fun. You can play all sorts of different characters. Not to mention but, I also really recommend the Blacksmith DLC

"
22180,Brings me back to the years I spent sleeping over a friends house on weekends and him and I along with his lil bro would always play this on thier Xbox360 the ice knight will always be my go to though i find the pink one to be cutely creative.
22181,I first started playing this on Xbox 360 and let me tell you it is a blast. The game is easy to pickup and it allows you to bassically play your way. You unlock different people based on who you clear the game with. There is a chart that tells you which people unlock who. The story is nice and the ending is a plot twist you wont forget. I recommend buying this and playing it through just once. Then play it again with someone new!
22182,gay sexing peehole pls die i am niger killer 228 shit on my sister
22183,i have to say this game is fun fare fun if you like 3D and 2D mixed to toughter then try this is fun and have adventure game really fun fare fun so try it out is a adventure co op action indie multiplayer game
22184,"Love this game, might be a bit buggy with the laoding screen going black, but it might be a setting i have with the resolution. But besides that, Solid game that needs more players."
22185,it is a good game buy it
22186,Having fun playing with friends
22187,"Grind, get a new weapon, grind, get a new character, grind again, then repeat."
22188,Solid dating sim
22189,I Like this game(I suggest supporting these people and everyone who play it)
22190,Lots of fun with family and friends! Replayability with new characters as well. Highly recommend as a couch co-op game.
22191,Good... I had fun.
22192,i like it. It was nice. I had fun.
22193,Absolute banger! Would Play whole campaign again.
22194,"Good game to play alone.
Great game to play with friends.

22195,One of the best games you really have to play it !!
22196,tdrfyuio
22197,A very fun game
22198,Very gooooooooooooooood!
22199,"A classic.

Great adventure with friends and even by yourself!
The music and soundtrack in this game is what I love most about it all. It's absolutely amazing."
22200,somebody toucha my spaget
22201,Is very good This game
22202,Fun little party game to play with plenty to do. Very funny and easy to play and really enjoyed. once you beat it there is plenty of replay value however I wish there was some lvl dlc or a second game to play.
22203,Best Game Ever :v
22204,Co-op is amazing and more games need co-op like this even if it is just on the same screen let alone online functionality.
22205,having a lot of fun with this game in multiplayer mode! the tiny unexpected features make it a great game (like being able to steal and ride around on a crocodile)
22206,"Funny, simple and rewarding game for those that like to kill tons of enemies with a sword/bow/magic. For the price of it I have to say that I am trouly amazed."
22207,"great game but it can be a little challenging sometimes
that volleyball game is annoying it felt great when i completed it 
i recommend playing with atleast 1 friend
i also got it during winter sale so it cost only 2 euros and a few cents
i also find it sad how this game is more than 5 years old but is better than most games made after 2014
"

22210,"Ridiculously good game, best with friends!"
22211,shopping cart hero was better
22212,"Love the game. Simple, short and with great replay ability, plus even better with friends."
22213,The game is a good start for begining computer players that are transitioning from xbox or ps. you need a remote unless you want a challenge this games goes from beating every level easly to losing so many times. Just Have Fun this is a fun game if you make it just don't rage.
22214,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmhowdoiplaythis?
22215,"Fun side scroller beat-em-up.  Reminds me back to the days of TNMT 2 on the NES.  Fun game, better with co-op."
22216,"I LOVE THIS GAME! I played this on the Xbox 360 when it first came out. I've invested so much time in this game and it may be the first game I 100%. My only complaint is the laggy multiplayer when playing with friends, but other than that it's an AMAZING game."
22217,"One of the best beat-em-ups around for up to 4 players, Castle Crashers mixes RPG elements with some really nice design. Only issue is that even with all the upgrades it can get a little repetitive. But still provides many many hours of hilarious fun."
22218,"its BEAUTIFUL
"
22219,Probably one of the best local coop games with a twisted funny plot. Would definitely recomend to play it with friends.

This games is great for friends and family. Very enjoyful game. Love each second I have played and will continue playing it. Been playing it with lan party, family and friends. Great game for starters. The game has great story and very good system. Castle Crashers has great graphics and sounds, but also love the compartibility with different types of controllers that is a plus for me. I highly recommend this game for kids and adults."

22225,"It's a fun game to play with friends. So you losers out there playing Castle Crashers alone, go get some friends!"
22226,Amazing game for multiplayer and single player. Definitely worth your money.
22227,Glitch keeps making me lose my saves making me have to replay levels. Do not buy until fixed!
22228,Get 3 people and start playing what are you doing with your life?
22229,great game but not worth full price if playing solo wait till sale and get 3 friend to buy it with you to make it more fun still good 8/10.
22230,tfw you dont have friends and you have to beat the game alone
22231,"Great game for some coop fun. It took me a while to finally playthrough all the way, but had fun with friends when we decided to load it up. Didn't attempt a solo playthrough. IMO, this is one of those games that's better with friends. Full of humor, controls are great, and has some challenge. 100% achievements is going to be a grind."
22232,Chill party couch game that I enjoyed playing with my brothers. Got it when it was $3 and would totally recommend.
22233,melhor jogo
22234,"Funny, I just think multiplayer connection setup could be improved. If someone has a bad connection it makes the game unplayable for everyone."
22235,Simple but very fun beat'em up.
22236,"Originally I played this on Xbox 360 and loved it.  Fortunately, it's still a wonderfull experience on Steam.  This game reminds me on the old school games where you need to fight your way through hordes of weird enemies to save the princess (or in this case 4 princesses).  This it a lot of fun single player and multiplayer."
22237,cool
22238,Cool.
22239,"One of the best games I’ve ever played I just want more dlc characters
"
22240,Great!!!
22241,the game is good but when fighting i fell like you get hit with allmost everything and that your hit box is bigger than you and if you get noked down once then a lot of your health gets taken away by enimes combowing my main complaint is that enimes can just endlesly hit you with projectils eseshaly in the forest and this game semes less than a game were you can go in and pumble your enemis i always seem to have to make up a staugy to defet a level when i thought that it was suposed to be a game like hyrule warriors insded of a stategy game but still fun to play
22242,"best game in its class. following this in the same class would be metal slug
"
22243,sjiy
22244,The art is really cute and it is fun to play. Especially good if you're bored.
22245,"this game to me, has very hard to learn controls and I wasn't able to get past that, if you are able to then you may enjoy this game, if not then I sadly can not reccomend this game to you"
22246,Reminds me of the Ninja Turtles games or Simpsons games we all used to play at the Skating rinks. 10/10
22247,Must have if you like Co-op Games. Buy the Pink Knight for an extra $0.99 it is too much fun.
22248,"Very good game, ... what else ?

No seriously, if you want to have some fun with your friends around a good video game ! that's the one. Funny atmosphere, very good music, very pleasant nervous game, ... Yes, all that stuff for that price ? go for it !

22252,"Is a good game, buy now"
22253,this made my yeezys turn into sketchers
22254,do you really like play ball? I don`t like it .
22255,"Me and my friend were impressed on this one, it's really great that we stumble upon this gem. It's super great with friends whether online multiplayer or local couch-multiplayer. I really hope many people appreciate this kind of game, they are fun even if it's like a child's game (although there's brutality in this one so i won't call it too much of a child's game) Coop is really fun i definitely recommend this one!"
22256,This game is so much fun. I love the multiplayer and the variety of characters you can play as. I wish though in the multiplayer it sometimes does not give you the animal followers. But over all a funny and enjoyable experience
22257,"played the game solo

Dayam, this is tons of fun! after 10~ playthroughs the game will probably start becoming repetitive when you're tryin to unlock a new guy, but its a blast so far!"
22258,"i've watched other people play this before, and it is super fun, but im playing it on a computer and it wont let me use my skill points so i cant really get anywhere..."
22259,"Very fun game! 

It is defenitly a funny and challenging game. I would recomend this to people who like fighting games and good jokes, I dont think its very graphfic but if you don't like seeing rooms filled with dead bodies be aware XD"
22260,"behemoth never disappoints.

extremely fun game, however, it is made for co-op for a reason. this game is 10x more fun with friends, as most games are, so grab a friend and play this game!"
22261,"*HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*: Play this with friends, more fun.  (THIS IS A MUST PLAY, IT GETS BETTER AT THE END.)

LOVE FARMING LEVELS? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU.

LOVE KNIGHTS? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU.
 
LOVE AWESOME SOUNDTRACKS? THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.

LOVE BOSS FIGHTS? YOU BET THIS GAME IS RIGHT FOR YOU.

LOVE FANTASY GAMES? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU.

LOVE TO PLAY GAMES? WHY ARENT YOU PLAYING THIS GAME THEN?

LOVE MAGIC? THIS GAME HAS IT.

LOVE COMBOS WITH WEAPONS? THIS GAME HAS IT.

LOVE PETS THAT WILL BE YOUR COMPANION AND HAS A ABILITY THAT CAN HELP YOUR CHARACTER? THIS GAME HAS A TON OF THEM."
22262,"The [b]Co-op mode[/b] is multiplying the gameplay experience and gives you tons of funny moments. The cartoon graphic is highlighting the humor of this game. I recommend it more for multiplayer, but single play gives funny time and challenges battles as well.
[i]Rating: 7.5/10[/i]"
22263,"The artistic style is cute but thats about the only good thing.  The campain is the same repeatative smashing throughout. Really boring and repeatative.  Maybe it's a better game in online multiplayer, but I bought it because, it was recommended to play with wife, and neither of us really enjoyed it."
22264,"TL;DR: Castle Crashers is an immensly fun sidescroller. Great artwork, great music, great with friends. Just buy it already.

Castle Crashers is by far, my favorite side scrolling action game. PERFECT for playing with friends, this game is easily in my top 3 best games to play with others. It's just great classic beat-em-up style fun. It can be challenging at times, but never really too hard.

[h1]Plot & What You Do[/h1]
You're a knight. An evil wizard steals the princess(es). You get 'em back. 

You fight droves of enemies, using your sword, your magic, and your wits. You collect little pets to help you out (example, the Bitey Bat will attack your enemies, Seahorse will raise your chances of finding great items). You fight for glory in the arena. 

[h1]Pros[/h1]
-Single Player, Local Multiplayer, Online Multiplayer, Co-op, Online Co-op
-Multiple game modes
-Fun, exciting gameplay
-Great artwork
-Nice soundtrack
-TRADING CARDS AND (therefore) BADGES
-5+ characters to choose from
-Arenas, for beating the living daylight out of your friends
-Lots of swords
-Companion animals, to give you special perks on your quests
-No bugs that I've encountered

[h1]Cons[/h1] 
After honestly considering it, I don't think I can find a single con for this game. Yeah, I'm totally biased, but I love this game. Give it a try, and see if you agree. Definitely worth the price."
22265,Childhood comes back
22266,"I'm not a fan of the Beat 'em up genre, but this was pretty enjoyable. I would certainly recommend finding a friend to play this with you because playing alone is a much different and more difficult experience.

Try the Demo!

Pros:
-Great local co-op game. There aren't enough of these.
-The level-up system is pretty cool. Tweak your character's health, melee, magic attack, and such to play as you wish.
-You get to fight a giant ear of corn.
-It's a bright, colorful, and, best of all, a very funny game. 
-The gameplay is satisfying and controls aren't clunky.

Cons:
-No online multiplayer anymore, from what I can tell.
-Singleplayer mode for me is too hard. You need a partner to revive you.
-There is no list in game for combos. They are only displayed once, and I ended up forgetting my new attacks and feeling underpowered. I don't like having to Alt+Tab out of my game to Google the attack list for a game."
22267,Very Good Game 10/10 !
22268,"A game so hard at points that I considered switching to Dark Souls. However a very fun experience! I recommend playing with your significant other, a close friend or just anyone that you trust. This because if you die during a level, chances are you'll have to restart from the beginning and believe me, you don't want to be the reason for that :D fantastic level design, creative boss levels, a real challenge for even the most experienced gamers."
22269,"THIS GAME IS F*****G AWESOMEGSHDVDBSHGBSNHBNSGHJHDGS


if you play it with friends"
22270,Fun game to play with friends!
22271,okay
22272,Best Gaming in the World.
22273,"Game 10 of 10, please add new characters which you can select and at the beginning and as the pacing will open and I would like 2 pieces or updates. I beg you the new part and updates.
But the game is very cool and funny)

Add to the example of large pets supposedly teddy bear white and new bosses and princesses supposedly the boss lives on the clouds well in this regard. And since the game is very interesting, I played it straight into it without ceasing and right now it happens.
Spapsibo for the game.

And once again please add bosses to the biomes of the princess characters, please update the game completely.

The game surpassed my expectations, I'm from the game in full of joy, it is very entertaining.



And leave the same graphics and style very cool.

I want to say a lot about this game and maybe in 2 days I'll write a review of your game and the battleBlock Theater.
The game is the most


And there will be a continuation"
22274,10/10 more fun with friends
22275,"The fighting system is realy good, bosses are just epic and the soundtrack makes the game even better. MUST PLAY!!

8.5/10"
22276,"It's a nice game. The keyboard controls are pretty weird, so definitly reccomend a controller if you are going to play it."
22277,this is by far the most fun i had while playing a beat-em-up. i reccomend 10/10
22278,"pros
- great soundtrack
- 4 player co-op online or local
- great controls
- leveling up system
- boss battles
- combat system which is easy to learn
- many different characters to choose from and unlock
- pets that give you perks

 cons

- story mode is short








bought on winter sale"
22279,muito pika eh nos
22280,"this game will always bring back great memories of playing it on the Xbox 360 when i was a kid. This game is best played with friends and will bring in a ton of hours. great humour used at times, great story with hours of fun behind. Would definately reccomend getting whilst on sale whenever possible. great game. 8/10"
22281,fun game to play with amigos
22282,I grew up plating this game and when i first saw it on the steam store i had to have it just to play through it with my friends that have never heard anything of this game and now about 5 ofthem own it. I remember playing this game when i was 5 with my cousin who first introduced it to me on xbox 360 and i loved it ever since. I would recomend this game to many of the people and friends that i know.
22283,Good game
22284,"Castle Crashers is a very fun and simple game. I bought it for £1.99 in the Winter 2017 sale and it was worth every penny. It offers a relatively short story, but with maxium replayability. You play as a knight trying to save your King's precious artifact thingy and to get it, you must battle through a huge variety of enemies and bosses. The story is there in this game, but hardly ever referred to, and so much stuff is going on, you hardly think about it. Gameplay is incredibly fun, as you hack and slack your way through waves upon waves of enemies in different levels and arenas. Graphics are not good or bad, just Ok (As you can tell from the preview pictures). Difficulty ranges from super easy to incredibly difficult; depends on the player's level and skill as well as the weapons and magic you are wielding. Very fun to play with friends and I would recommend to play with a controller."
22285,Very fun
22286,old but gold
22287,"Great game................. If you've got a friend to play with. The whole game is based on multiplayer (whether online or local), 

I WOULDN'T recommand it for solo players tho."
22288,"""I'm only going to put points into attack"" said player 3
""I'm going to allocate all my exp. point to magic"" said player 4
""I'll max out the speed stat if its the frist thing I would do"" said player 2
""I'll ... max defence I guess"" I said.
...
7 hours of the most dysfunctional team gameplay ensued. 
It was great time."
22289,"DIS GAME AWSOME

22290,"This game is humour and serious shit in one. If youre looking for the g o o d s t u f f this is what you want. Unlock new characters and replay the game as them. Weird ass story, but still. Cool gameeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaeeeeeeeeee"
22291,"heh

22292,This game is great with friends! Very chaotic and enjoyable to play. Not many games are like this was glad to have played it.
22293,very fun entertainment game to play with friends 9/10
22294,Suuuuper cool game. Not a lot of others like it and allows me to relax my hands onto a controller after playing with keyboard all day. Same goes for BattleBlock: another great original game by the same great developers.
22295,"Dang this game make me really addicting.Love the animation,good quality and the best bossfight,you can kiss princess EZ"
22296,"Very fun to play friends. Also, this game contains unexpected funny moments and crazy broken Bosses. LOL. You may die alot but your team will help you out, even though when it comes to gold and __________ there won't be a team. Furthermore, you will have to kill your friends lol. (((***SORRY FOR THE SPOILER***)))"

22300,awesome game!!!
22301,"wHY iS THerE nO caSTle cRaShErS 2?
"
22302,game
22303,"This game does not take itself seriously at all (like a lot of Behemoth games) and I love it for that. I'd imagine playing it by yourself would be kind of boring but with friends it's a lot of fun. This game had more depth to it's combat than I anticipated, you can actually rack up massive hit streaks on enemies with different combos. The amount of weapons, characters and different stats you can upgrade really add to the replayability of the game. I found depth perception an issue when placing my character to attack enemies and would end up hitting air alot but I think thats less a fault with the a game and more the fact that I am retarded and have shit eyesight. There was the occassional glitch where we couldn't progress any further after all enemies had been defeated, it wasn't extremely common and seems to be random but it got annoying a few times as we had to restart. Multiplayer can also become slightly laggy both with latency and frame rate. I'd say the content you get for this game would be worth around $10."
22304,"LOVE THE GAME BUT i tried loadin it when it starts up i see the first part of the intro then the whole screen is black
"
22305,"Bought it on sale, paid only 2,39€. I usually play it with my nephew and we like it. Even playing solo is interesting, playing online, specially with friends is great."
22306,"Hay algunos bugs que hacen que tengas que empezar todo el nivel de vuelta, pero el juego está bueno y divertido, no es un juego en el que sea 100% Singleplayer, pierde un poco el chiste y la diversión si no lo jugás con amigos xdxd"
22307,"""The game... is fun""

22313,"its a good game good soundtrack good item and yeah its epic and i got this game and battleblock theater for sale which means i have the can't stop laughing bundle the games are both epic

"
22314,"This game is relatively short considering it doesn't take very long to get through it. However, it's plenty fun and has a ton of replayability not to mention it is coop. If you want to have a good time then play this game."
22315,Best Couch Coop Adventure ever !
22316,Must play with friends. It get difficult on the harder modes.
22317,Play it. It's awesome.

22334,"Really fun, beginners can easily keep up with simple combos and experienced players destroy enemies with insane combos... Fun for everyone, you can play with up to 3 friends, either online or in the same device. No need to split screen because all characters fit in one. 

Too addictive, played it for more than 12 hours per day since I got it!"

22342,Good game. Very funny
22343,this game is amazing.I have competed the game and it was very fun with my friend. 10/10
22344,"I higly recommend this game, very fun even in single player, and of course more players = more fun. 5/5"
22345,so good to play with friend

22347,where can i buy this sandwich
22348,"This game, I cannot tell you how much I've played this game when I was a child. I saw this on the Steam Winter sale with the price tag of $10 for a 4 pack. I knew what I was getting, so, why not share the joy and give to my other friends? Well, a few of us tried to set up a game, but we got an error message that was not allowing us to start games up. It was a bit saddening to say the least, but hey, I got a game I played for hours when I was in secondary school. So I picked up my chinese knock off X360 controller, plugged it in the PC, started playing an old classic.

I guess the past never changes, I used a combo when I first started playing and I have never staved away from it, X+Y repeat X in the air until the EXP bar increases no more. This is how I usually beat the game casually within 2-3 hours (probably should video myself). I just, repeat the same actions as any other character; no magic, mid-low attack, no agility, high defense, I usually beat the game when I get to level 25-27.

The gameplay is pretty dang good for a flash game. It's a medieval themed Double Dragon type of fighting game that opens up more options the more you progress. The more you put attributes into your stats, the more your character improves. With the stats capping off at level 78, you still learn new combos even after the stats being maxed out, with the level cap being 99.

The difficulty is at this point for me, pretty easy, but when I first played when I was 3rd grader, it was still pretty easy. This game isn't really that hard, unless your massochist like me who plays insane mode after the normal adventure. I remember little me playing it on the Xbox with the Snakem Knight, reaching level 80 and getting stuck in the Swamp level for weeks on end. I remember never stopping, I remember saying to myself ""I got this far so why stop now?"". Well, I'm still stuck on the Swamp level, mostly because it got overshadowed by Terraria in middle school.

The story is nothing special, get the girl from the Barbs, get the black one from the Cyc (that's the wrong number!), save Elsa from the Joker in blue attire, and then save the clown from chest Cthulu and then look at the clown. Simple as showing a 1700s man how to cook a microwave burrito. They won't understand what the heck you are talking about until you show them.

Time for the negatives, this game has some copy and paste character styles, not every character is unique. Grey Knight is just Cone Knight, Demon is the same as Fire Knight, there's a few others to point out, but I can't think of them on the top of my head. Not only that, the animal orbs are relatively broken early game, I feel like the animal orbs should be locked off like the weapons until you reach a certain level or location.

This game isn't perfect, but I do hold this game dear to myself as it one of the first games I've ever truly gotten large addiction to. I'd give this game a 7.9/10, it's really good."
22349,castle chrashers is an awesome game in every depardment.It has great art style'gameplay and music.The only downside is the humor which is stupid sometimes
22350,"a great game asides for my lack of people to play with, and the online matches never finding anyone regardless of the time. i'd only get it in a sale since $15 a bit much for me, but that's fine."
22351,Fun fun fun! I just wish there was more Packs available on Steam like on PS4 :/
22352,Great game!One of the best games i have played!
22353,rape
22354,"i crashed like one castle and it was your own damn castle 

mhm out of mmm yes"
22355,"grate game vary fun and funny. and can be played with frends on and offline
"
22356,"i think i killed someone
nevermind i'm just gonna mount my shitting deer"
22357,BLACK SCREEN. Cannot even play.
22358,"Hard to find strangers or players to play with disappointingly boring due to these things happing, if you don’t have someone else to play with it gets boring quickly in my opinion."
22359,"This game is a lot of fun, especially if you have people to play with. It's a very fun game to play when you just want to sit back and relax. If you would like to give this game a go, I would recommend you use a controller because the controls are better. There are bosses you have to kill, upgrades for your character, pets with different abilities, arenas where you unlock new characters and let's not forget the most important thing which is beating up people :p. If I were to describe the game with 2 words they would be ""Fuckin amazing""!"
22360,"the game is lots of fun, has great graphics, and is easy to play with friends! definitly a good game"
22361,"First girl i get, after my friend killed me everytime with his spammy Red Knight, turns to be a clown, and a prank.
10/10 IGN Cheers you bastards"
22362,"You physically cannot hate this game. Who doesn't like beating up the bad guys, only to later beat up your friends for a peck on the cheek?

This game will always be fantastic."
22363,You fight different enemys and bosses and save princesses. It's also funny.
22364,"Purchased it for local coop, and this game excels at it."
22365,So good game <3
22366,me go BOO MBOOM KILL BIG MAN
22367,"man do I LOVE games that have false advertisment and clickbait, if you want to see those things you should head on and purchase this game."
22368,[h1] I like it. [/h1]
22369,It was a good ride. Until my Steam Link broke!
22370,"oh god this game is amazing  and fun , its dark souls 2D xD"
22371,10 farting deers out of 10.
22372,"Totally worth it WITH i repeat WITH anyone else to play... 
if alone playing with your ballz might be a better option.. 
With multiple people id prefer it too, but ya this game is fun so leave those ballz alone for a minute ;3
And best thing is i been on the hunt for decent games that would run on my 12"" win pc tabs with only 2g rams
And so this fits right in there and runs perfectly ;3 alongside 100% juiceee 
i can use steam to stream games up to 6g on the Tabs but ya then it bothers my Workstation ;3
I mean on sale i really dont see why you wouldn't want to pick this up..
Totally worth it, even now a few years later ;3 aged well"
22373,"Game is guud, game is betta with frendz, I haz no frendz, so game iz guud"
22374,"Castle Crashers is a fun game that you can play with multiple people. Now, I completed this game by myself with no other people helping, however, the entertainment value is still there.

Talking as a singleplayer experience, I do think the game is too short and can get repetitive at points. But ignoring all of that, this game is essentially flawless. The goofy cartoon style is fun and fits the tone of the game perfectly. The humor is very much Old-School Newgrounds and being that the game is published by them, it makes sense. The hack-and-slash gameplay is standard, but the leveling system makes it feel a lot more dynamic than it could have been. 

Now as a multiplayer game, this is the ultimate game to pop-out. The game is short, but that is great if you just want to complete the game in one night with a couple of friends. The gameplay feels a lot more insane and fast-paced when there are four people on the team rather than just one. I often lost track of where I was, and that is not bad. It just kept me on the edge of my seat more. If you really want to experience this game, you should get together a couple of controllers and friends, and just go from the beginning. 

This game has HUGE replay value. This is always essential in games with short campaigns like this. You may have ""completed"" the game, but you haven't collected all the pets, or all the characters, or all the weapons. There is so much more to this game then there is on the surface. 

TL;DR great multiplayer game, and has replay value"
22375,"amazing game, fun with friends!"
22376,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUo-ME2zrTs
22377,solid game to binge on
22378,"I've been playing this game since around 2008-2009 when it first came out on the Xbox360, so this is also a nostalgic game for me. Absolutely a blast to play with 1-3 other friends, best times I've ever had in gaming. I recently purchased a gaming pc, and I had to buy this game. Even solo, speedrunning this game is great and the replayability is surprisingly super existant. This game is comical, yet super serious if you want to delve into the speedrunning aspect, which is completely optional. The game has unique bosses and magic, and I'm pretty sure I've beat this  game  at least 25 times and here I am. 

TL;DR fun game, cheap (can buy for 2.99$usd on a big sale), and isn't intensive on hardware. Super fun for solo or up to you and 3 friends. Great casual experience, and great speedrunning opportunity."
22379,thicc
22380,yes
22381,Yes it is very well made!
22382,AWESOME!
22383,GIT GUD
22384,I love this game! I got it in the winter sale for $2.99! It goes on sale a lot so just hold out.
22385,ysdrtres
22386,very nice
22387,Great games with lots of combos that you have to remeber (or you could just button mash) and also comes with a great story to enjoy and have some laughs.
22388,gg ez no re
22389,"Every things a fart joke, or every things not a fart.



Good Game"
22390,This game is so L I T
22391,"its great i love this game
:D <3
"
22392,"Buy or Don't Buy: Definitely Buy

A must own game that which of the likes of TMNT or Street Fighter fighter/level scrollers. It is fun by yourself or with your friends. Funny commentary and lots of replayability. I didn't care much for the other mode in the game however."
22393,"Love it
"
22394,pretty funn
22395,nice game and you gonna like this if you played this back then in newgrounds..if you want to play with someone make sure you have friends good luck finding random players in online.
22396,"This game has hours of replay ability. 103 hours already, easy to play 4 player fun for the whole family."
22397,You are bored to death so you play oldschool style web games
22398,Only fun in multiplayer-- but unplayable due to intensive lag and latency issues
22399,"It has everything a straight male could like in a game. Riveting gameplay, laugh-out-loud humor, and a story that is fun and exciting to replay over and over. The best part was probably the Back Off Barabarian. I love the DDR styled controls. In the original story, there's tons of laughable points. If you get bored of the story (somehow), you can always play the multiplayer with friends. Overall, it's got loads of replayability, and I would recommend this to everybody."
22400,"Very good game! Castle Crashers is the game which I have spent the most time on out of all of my Steam games (when I created this review). Have bought both DLC's available on PC (also, when I created this review), but I am definitely hoping for MANY more DLC's!!! What I am most likely looking for is most likely some Animal Orbs and weapons, and yes, of course more characters (Or add all the other DLC's for XBOX onto Steam, that be great [because it'd be easier for you and cooler for me]). So, in all, my review: higher than Overwhelmingly Positive."
22401,hey you developers yes you please more games you could be rich of fame (nice game btw) by one of your customers <3
22402,relly fun game im leval 23 or 25 alredy its so esay. (sometimes) and its so fun i relly love it and hope you guys will to

22406,muy buen juego pero muy corto
22407,Castle Crashers is an amazing 4 player game. That's all I got.
22408,"Really really fun !
Finished it something like 10 times On XBox, but the steam version is even better !
Playing it with friends is the way to go, But if your internet sucks, you wont enjoy online.
Couch co-op is perfect !"
22409,"When on sale for $2.99, definitely buy it. The 2D/3D twist is really cool, and the ability to play with friends is awesome. The story is not very outlined, but you get the gist f you play for long enough. Not a top-charts game, but really worth it if you want to pass some time and have some fun."
22410,"10/10 game,Laugh so much, it's very fun to play with friends. i really like it"
22411,"its gets quite interesting and funny when you play with friends
"
22412,"Great game! I love it, perfect amount of fun and challenges!"
22413,Güzel ve farklı bir FPS oyunu.Multiplayer sunmuyor size ama çok güzel bir hikaye sunuyor.Silah sesleri gerçeğe çok yakın.Hikayesi sizi alıp götürecek cinsten.Tavsiyemdir
22414,"cool , very cool

22415,"Brings back child memories, would play with my cousins and brothers on Xbox 360, like this game was my childhood thank god it was on sale so I can cop it, love it xd"
22416,"[h1] Really cute and fun game!! [/h1]

It's really engaging and the gameplay feels new and original c: The artstyle is very pretty, the effects are smooth and well-done, too :3
[b] I totally recommend playing with a friend to get as much fun as possible! [/b]

Have fun <3"
22417,cool :)))
22418,This game is sooo much fun. Golden Axe style game play and a nice cartoony feel and funny. At 1.99 in sale why not? and of course fun co-op with friends.
22419,:)
22420,"A game in the style of Golden Axe and the D&D side scroller games...with a distinctive art style, a wild sense of humor, and a lot of goofy fun.

The control take a tiny bIt of time to get used to, as it's more fiddley then most games of this genre when it comes to what it will and won't accept for the ""depth"" of hits.  However, otherwise it's a load of fun and gives one a great idea about what the developer is all about.

Highly Recommended."
22421,Pretty fun once you get the hang of it and playing with friends makes it even better. Definietly worth the money if you're willing to play the game over a couple times.
22422,rilly goods game
22423,yes
22424,yeaeey
22425,">Played This Game On PS3
>Liked It
>Turned On PC

LOOK AT DEVELOPERS!! GREAT GAME BUYYYYYY IT! 11/10 Would Play Again"
22426,Gr8 g8me m8 i r8 8/8
22427,amazing game
22428,Absolutely fantastic game. Most of my hours are on XBox but the PC version is headsabove the rest!
22429,"Just get it, no time to explain why, just get the damn game already."
22430,its not bad
22431,Cool game
22432,reject modernity embrace newgrounds
22433,GOOD GAME GG! MUST PLEYY
22434,"Amazing game! Would highly recommend playing with a friend, was a fantastic game from start to finish"
22435,"This is a fun game about how you play as knight/crusader who has to rescue four a princesses and a some special gem from the main bad guy.... that is as far as i got in the story line anyway. I would say its fun because this game can be played with up to four player on both story and kinda free areana area, though both of those are kinda limited at this point. Still a great game to play every once in a while with friend or even by yourself (with other people is recommended).So yeah good game..... much else to say."
22436,"Yes, i've only played 40 minutes here. My experiece comes from 8 years on Xbox.

Castle Crashers is one of my favorite games and makes other beat-em-ups look like dogshit. Like Streets Of Rage. Or that awful Scott Pilgrim Game. 

Lets take the standard beat-em-up formula, give the players combos, magic, some light rpg elements, and paint them in Dan Paladins unrivaled artstyle. Then lets have them fight dozens of enemies through dozens of unique, memorable environments, while jamming out to the best music ever put to a video game. While we're at it, let's give them unlockable weapons, orbs, and a bunch of other shit we wont even tell them about. Like a shovel. Yeah, let's put a shovel in the game. Some players may never see it, but whatever. 

I don't trust people who haven't played Castle Crashers. If you love indie games, this is entry-level stuff. Of course, it may turn you off from other indie games because you won't believe anything could be better than this hand-drawn masterpiece."
22437,Definitely a pretty fun game. Something fun to play with friends but equally as fun to play by yourself. Hopefully I can get a little bit better at this game.
22438,Awesome game if you have friends. I dont. Still a really awsome game.
22439,Great game to play with a full party. Good fun.
22440,Hands down one of the best games ever. So glad my friend got it for me!
22441,"it gud
"
22442,Absolutley loved it
22443,Adorable game. Definitely worth playing. 2D but still fun! buy it and play it! you wont regret it.
22444,One of the best co-op games ever made. if you're a fan of the classic newgrounds style look and gameplay you'll love this game. also the more players the better
22445,"FUCK YO SHIT BITCHES

"
22446,soo fun wow
22447,"Игра хорошая, темболее с друзьями"
22448,"It's an incredible game in many aspects, the art style is phenomenal, the humor is ridiculous in a manner than is both subtle and obvious at the same time. The gameplay is always fun, it's incredible when playing with friends. With the massive amount of characters and items and pets and modes you never run out of ways to enjoy the game, so this game is worth picking up."
22449,"This game is amasing, fun, and provides hundreds of hours of entertainment. play alone, with friends, even with young people too! it is simple, rather easy to learn, and is funny. i used to have this game on my 360 years ago, but it broke, so i've always wanted to play it again. I found it on steam about a year  or two ago, and i deeply enjoy it. i reccomend this game to anyone who has friends that come over, or can play online, or just anyone with even a bad computer like me, whitch cant play counter-strike or war thunder, even in their lowest settings. Now that i'ts 80 percent off (winter sale)it is only 3 dollars! come one, comke all! Get some fun right here!"
22450,Really fun to play both with friends and by yourself.
22451,"I got this game yesterday, and I already have 8.4 hours. I think that says something. This game is a fun mix between an rpg and a beat em up, with funny moments, hard challenges, asnd puzzles, so I think that this game has something for everyone. I give this a 9/10."
22452,Good game!
22453,"this game are realy fun with frinds. 
if you have a frinds that buy this game buy this game also its worth the money"
22454,"[b] Gracias [/b] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/S4W4/] Saky [/url] [b] Por el juego <3 [/b]

Vale la pena comprarlo y descargarlo :D"
22455,it's a super fun game but when you beat the game you just start over agen with a new guy and if you are not in to mmo or rpg don't buy it but i love it and it is one of the best games i play and haft playet i my hole life
22456,"This game is very fun and enjoyable to play with your friends. The more friends you have, the more fun the game. It's a blast!"
22457,DarkSteelWing
22458,Its getting boring after 30 minutes but the idea is alright
22459,"This game is good, only with Friends."
22460,"Fun gameplay with a good mix of comedy. This is a great game for the family and would recomend playing with some friends too.
9/10"
22461,Great replay value
22462,this is a crazy game and if you like a game which has a very simple friendly feel to it then this is your game
22463,hella fun
22464,A lot of fun but sometimes overrated.
22465,"A fantastic game and I'm so glad it exists. Like it says on start-up, though, a controller is highly recommended."
22466,Heck.
22467,Very entertaining and addicting!
22468,Great game!
22469,el juego es bastante divertido y es mejor al jugar con amigos y cuando termina uno este juego hay mas variedad por que desbloqueas a mas personajes haciendo que el juego no te aburra tanto
22470,"I like the green guy because that is the color of Frog Detective whom I greatly respect and admire. This game may not have Frog Detective, but it is enjoyable and green enough that you almost do not notice."
22471,"i would not suggest this game to the people that love the gore and guts but this is a very stupidly fun game for many people, with a sense of comedy this game does not have a lot of story. but it is worth the time it takes to play the game to the finish."
22472,"amazing game, you should try it!
"
22473,Ingame I had a big rampage so 5 stars
22474,Great game but I can not play more unfortunately becausemy friend sucks at this and doesnt wants to play with me he is a confirmed gay person if you want to hook up with hım add his steam
22475,"This game is very good. I can't really explain why its so good, but I feel like its good because of how rewarding it is to pull off combos. The level system is very fun, and the game never gets bland. When you get bored of the main gamemode, just switch to the other modes, or play a different game then come back. My only complaint is that the game basically needs to be played with a controller. I think you shouldn't buy this unless you have a controller. You may even want 2 controllers for a friend. Whatever you do, use a controller. The online is dead, but the singleplayer is still fun. If you like 2-d platforming fighting games, I think you would love this."
22476,"It's a very good and good game would good againg 10/10 IGN

22484,haHAA
22485,"Its amazing. I highly recommend to all players of any age. No swearing jsut full of sword fights, boomerangs, magic, horns, arrows, its realy a amazing game. I really want to thank the developers fo creating this gmae. Thanks guys!"
22486,"This game is very nice and fun to play with friends, but it is very laggy when I play it. I still recommend this game though!"
22487,Hack and slash your way to victory in this exciting game about knights and how they stab things.
22488,This game is basically hack and slash the enemies with combo action and magic. Fun to play with friends and easy to connect.
22489,this is the best game I've EVER played!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
22490,"Great game, tons of replay value with different characters. Challenging for sure."
22491,10/10 a must play.
22492,"This game is pretty old. But I love it. I havent gotten to the end so I cannot write a full review, but so far its amazing."
22493,So far the best indie side-scroller I've played.
22494,it gud game
22495,game is choppy with people you wanna play and no solutions work. Do not buy
22496,"Fun game to play with friends, if you have one."
22497,"Best $$ I've spent on steam, this game is a throwback to the coin-op arcade days. Its fun way to  unwind. Its easy to play and the cartoony graphics combined with hilariously morbid animations make this a must buy. Plus it is cheap enough to buy for three buddies for 4 player coop."
22498,"Amazing game, just finished it with my brother, really hoping that there will be a second one"
22499,"Not so pricy, fun, challenging action RPG games? This is one of them!
Try get these and gift to your friends when the discount is there! It is worth!

Tired of using 1 character's magic? Try playing the other one and unlock more, until you found the one that suits you!
The comedy also made your boring hack N slash becomes interesting. Boss and Muscular minions are challenging tough.
Not too easy and not too hard.

But it might be sad if you are playing alone."
22500,pretty wack mates
22501,"This is my favorite game by a long shot. I have played this game so much on the ps3 and i have gotten this game on sale. Honestly this game is worth the full price aswell. There is so much you can do and the devs of this game have put a great masterpiece of a game together. If you like killing people, things, using combos, having an objective to unlock everything in the game, having a lot of funny moments, pets, weapons, skills, bosses, mini bosses, and a good story line; then this game would be perfect for you."
22502,"A fun and frusterating beat-em-up with interesting progression hooks and great replayability.

You really have to have friends to play with though in my opinion."
22503,Is pretty nice
22504,Pure madness.
22505,"italian so called ""people"""
22506,"I love this game. I got it on sale, but I felt the need to spread it so much that I even bought it for one of my friends. 10/10 will play again and again and again and again"
22507,Awesome multiplayer game! Love it
22508,Tom fulp you never cease to amaze me.
22509,"Charismatic, Chaotic, and overall really fun game. PLaying with friends is recommend for a better experience but, if you don't have any, you can play with randoms! I guess that works too..
"
22510,"Very good and fun game!
Best played with friends"
22511,good game is good
22512,"+ Crazy story
+ soundtrack
+ price

-not

very good game I recommend"
22513,"SMASH THEM ALL

Thats the main message of the game.
But do not worry: There are atleast 15 minutes of gameplay in the game that require the use of a brain.

Actually, do you need a brain to understand the retarded humour in the game? I really need to think about that.....

Clear 10/10"
22514,"Fun with friends. Sad alone. Super realistic, and thumbs up because I never once got the princess, but that worked out for me in the end since life is nothing but crushing disappointment anyway!"
22515,"It's a great game. Fun alone and with friends, but, lets be honest here, its way more fun with friends."
22516,"You did it again Behemoth, my childhood is relived. I can't believe I'm able to still play it today, they even made an effort to make a new minigame mode and it's a blast with friends, can't say you'll like the humor, but it definitley is a silence breaker. I give this game my recommendation."
22517,AWESOME!!!!
22518,Its fun as I like the game style and abit of a nostalgia when I play this game as it reminds me of the old days of Super Mario and MapleStory
22519,Classic. Fun to play over and over again.

Get this, this christmas. YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
22523,Good game :)
22524,"Awsome game, if you have friends to play with is even more awsome."
22525,this is such a cool game :D
22526,"Probably the best arcade game ever made, definitely the most enjoyable, have a lot of fond memories of this game on console, but playing it on PC for the first time was without a doubt the best experience i've had with Castle Crashers, the perfect game to play with friends, and loads of replay value, unlocking different knights to play as is a great reason for more playthroughs! Thank you The Behemoth for creating such an awesome game. an easy 10/10"
22527,funny game ...good game :)
22528,Really fun for the first few playthroughs. I played a lot on Xbox and it's pretty fun.
22529,Any enemy that uses a bow and arrow has a special place on my stabby stick.
22530,Castle Crashers is good fun and a great game where you are a knight going around killin' enemies and savin' princesses
22531,10/10 beat them up. Game I had the demo on xbox before and now steam.This game very good.
22532,Really fun game and a cool beat em up
22533,"Castle Crashers is a great game. It's one of those games that you can bring out when you want to play a game with friends. I played through it once or twice for fun by myself, and I enjoyed it, but the real fun comes with multiplayer."
22534,Xbox 360
22535,"Really good game, one thing they copied Battle Crashers so i rate 1023012390593723894572390575/-1"
22536,"so addicting omfk but fun!!!!
"
22537,Probably one the most fun games I play with my family and friends in terms of couch co-op. So much so that everyone in our house has a copy of the game! The bosses are super entertaining to fight and it has just the right amount of challenges to keep it fresh for our younger gamers and the seasoned adults.
22538,"vros i had this on the xbox and i unlocked basically every character (beat the game as one of the four coloured knights, then as the character you unlocked for beating the game as the coloured knight) (and basically as in I did that for every knight but 1 colour) and itwas NOT WORTH IT

I do remember also however buying this day 1 and bringing my xbox 360 to a friend's sleepover that weekend and playing it all night with 3 friends and beating the game like that, which is completely and totally fun and worth it"
22539,"Great game and trust me it is worth it!! Especially whenever there is a sale is the game can be bought super cheap. I just finished the game alone, and it was a great experience. If you had a friend it would be even better! The art style was very unique and was very fond of it as well as the easy to learn combos and stat upgrading. If you're looking for a fun game that is a great time killer and a simple yet creative aspect then look no further because this is the game"
22540,This game is really fun with friends especially if you play with 4 people it is chaos! This game is super fun! You fight a bunch of monsters and bosses. Some levels have really cool parts like riding animals which is really fun! I give this game a 5/5
22541,"this game is full of action and funny moments it reminds me of cartoons now a days with goofy stuff in it and i like how you have to use stratagy to fight some bosses it makes me second guess my self and helps alot with real life so 10/10 would play 100 times more (if only there were more than 10 charictors in the game)
"
22542,It was awesome and fun but a little hard because of all the farming
22543,The nestalgia is getting to me
22544,crash the castle. have fun up until you fight the big buff enemies who i barely remember but i remember them being total ass sandwich. still good probably though.
22545,So fun playing this as coop with my gf! Totally would recommend this on sale
22546,Played that game so much on local co-op on xbox360 its just awsome!!!
22547,"This game has the audacity to offer the same level of gameplay as an average flash arcade style game, and make me pay $15 for it. This is, without a doubt, my worst Steam investment yet. Do not bother with this game."
22548,Its one of those games that can be like do this and that and then do it the same thing again. I did another review like this on we need to go deeper .
22549,1000/10

22551,"I tell you this game is one on the best hack and slash games out there!

Cheap and worth it."
22552,"Really love your game, But i dont like the style of pit peapole. But its just me i just dont like that kind of games"
22553,Cute game and graphics. I love it.
22554,"One of the better games to be ported over from XBOX arcade. The fighting is fun and game has lots of different characters to unlock and try out. Some of the most fun you can have with your friends, whether it's online or on the couch."

22571,"Entertaining Hack n Slash game that has a variety of levels, characters, companions and weapons. Multiplayer is quite the treat if you're the team helping type. Not exactly on the top of my list of something to play."
22572,Great game for couch gaming
22573,It gets quite boring after some time.
22574,nice
22575,"она просто ахуенна

"
22576,"Brilliant game I remember playing back on the Xbox 360.

I absolutely recommend this game if you're looking for some casual, yet fun gaming.

No issues with performance on Local.

Online games can jump a lot, would help if you have friends who would also play that are close by for optimal connection."
22577,Not bad of a game.........................................in fact I like it a lot. But if you have no friends to play with then I feel sorry for you.
22578,Neat.
22579,It would be nice if I had friends to play with... *sniff sniff*
22580,I f****g love this game
22581,"Started at my brothers house. Will finish it at my own PC XD
Reminds of old arcades, with a bit of a dirty humor"
22582,Grate game fun way to pass the time with friends
22583,"Extremely unbalanced, it's the first time in my life that I have not even enjoyed playing with my friends."
22584,gg wp
22585,its just plain fun
22586,"This is the first game i ever played a a younger kid. I absolutly love it. Hands down the best game i have ever played, and now that my friends play it with me i have begun to love it even more."
22587,Super fun co-op hack n' slash. Worth a purchase.
22588,This game is probably my favorite of all time. I have been playing this game since i was 6 or 7 probably the first real game i every played and i loved it since. I probably once a year finish the campaign with a friend or maybe just solo this game has a really good story and i think everybody should get it. I have bought this game on the xbox 360 and on multiple steam accounts :)
22589,"Great and fun game to play during class, not too advanced so your teacher won't say nothing. :-)"
22590,"Muito bom jogo da The behemoth, jogar sozinho esse jogo é ótimo porém com amigos fica bem melhor, modo história muito bom porém se dialogos mas isso não atrapalha na explicação da história.
"
22591,"Its pretty fun to play
"
22592,its alot of fun
22593,Great job with this classic game 'The Behemoth' I love the art style and gameplay!
22594,"How can you not like this game?
it's fun. happy not so hard and epic but after you finish the game people wonder what now? well me and my friend played it again but with diferent characters and you can always play it on expert mode! but i wish Castle crashers 2 came out"

22606,"Castle Crashers was my personal favorite Xbox Live Arcade game when it was first released back in 2008. The Behemoth continued to give this game more life with it's DLC of character's that had unique abilities, animal orbs that would accompany you throughout the game, and weapons that would improve your character's growth (or vice versa if you are looking for a challenge). The game was later ported to the Playstation Network with exclusive mini-games in 2010. Castle Crashers eventually was ported onto Steam, but was ported badly onto PC on launch; however, the game was redeemed to be fun and playable again after The Behemoth made necessary updates. 

This title is a hack and slash RPG, and has been widely recieved by many gamers who appreciate the genre (even those who don't). The game can feel a bit tedious at times, but as you level your character(s) the gameplay will feel slightly different before it tends to get repetitive once again. However, the game keeps the game fresh upon every level with unique scenary, opponents, and even jokes. If you plan on purchasing this title it's obviously more fun to play it with friends then it is with complete strangers, so try to convince your friends (and if they've convinced you to buy it listen to them). Completing the title will be a mission, but personally I think that's half the fun of trying to unlock every single character, find every animal orb and weapons. Give this game a try by downloading the demo. If you find the game a bit pricey than wait for a discount (or a Humble Indie Bundle that has this game packaged with it)."
22607,awesome =w=
22608,"I remember I first played this game on the Xbox 360 AND IT WAS SOOOO FUN!!! After that I got steam on my computer and found out it was on steam! I started playing and it is so fun. I reccomend this game if looking for a funny game with action, blood and a game that will make you try and try again!"
22609,Good game but why isint alien hominid on pc i really want to play it.
22610,"Bought this game on xbox sometime long ago, finished it just some weeks after, got to prestige 2 with fire knight. 

Then I saw this game on steam and I bought it to me and my friends and all of the DLC, just because I want to support the devs, love you guys<3"
22611,"ive played it for a short amount of time. and wow i want my money back. it look more fun than it is ands just.... bad

(This is my opinion)"
22612,very nice game to enjoy with your friends.
22613,200 hours. That is all.

22615,fun to play with friend. songs is nice too. love it
22616,"Amazing game. gameplay is awesome, unlocking things is difficult but challenging*which is good. cool storyline and weapons are awesome xD. overall amazing game. 10/10 would recommend"

10/10"
22622,"this game is honestly amazing. played multiple times on many platforms, enjoyed playing with friends and also like the opsion of couch co op"
22623,"looking at the review score you would think this game is Absolutly fantastic when in my opinion it is hovering right around mediocre 

Things the game does well
- visuals/art style
- sounds

things I think that it doesnt do well
- you get stun locked a lot
- to fight just button mash and you will do as well or better than if you were trying to control it
- the way that you level up is by hitting enemies and with each hit you get 1 xp which is a leveling system that I dont like (no point leveling up your main weapon as then you kill enemies faster and get less xp but then again if you dont level up your weapons monsters become tediously grindy making the game far longer than it should be and even when having the attack leveled up monsters are ""bullet sponges"" as is)
- too long of a grind
-annoying 3d dementions (going up and down in particular some bosses you literally are standing directly under them and you cant hit them they can only be hit from the sides while other bosses this is no problem and you can hit them from right below them, basically the up and down collision boxes are not great in this game

if there was a meh butten I would choose that but as there is not and it didn't keep my interest and I just didn't enjoy my time with this title its a no from me"
22624,"Awesome game, fun to play with friends or anyone really, the animations are adorable, great for gals and guys. Would definitely recommend this!!!

I do have one question, playing online with friends? Does anyone know the data usage or how much you could use playing anywhere from an hour + ?"
22625,"BUY IT 
JUST BUY IT
ALSO IT CHEAP WHEN THERE HAVE DISCOUNT"
22626,"Good game, it’s fun to play with other people but most of the time playing alone gives you more XP. I highly recommend this game!"
22627,Amazing game to play on your own or enjoy with friends. Castle crashers is both a great gaming experience taking you back to the days of couch multiplayer and good ol'  2-D slugfests or just plain out a fun stress reliever after a long day (or a couple stressful rounds of ranked play in your favorite FPS)
22628,"A fun game to play by yourself and others. If your trying to find a game that you can have your friends come over and play this is a grate game. its funny, well thought out, and challenging. also look at there other games becuse those are grate options to."
22629,Great couch coop game.  Ridiculous with 3-4 players (in a good way).  Good replayability with Insane mode.  Love that you can reset a characters stats if you want to play along side with someone new.  All and all a great buy and lots of fun.
22630,Great game to play with your friends. Me and my friends had a lot of fun playing it. The story is very interesting and every character is unique.
22631,Good to play with friends.

22633,"Hi ! I'm Cordis
I've been playing games since I was 6 and still love them just as much as I did then, My favorite games are Dark Souls and the Uncharted Series, I'm not much of a PC gamer but I play whenever I feel like it."
22634,"While I am not the greatest at this game by any means I had way too much fun and found it to be one of the most enjoyable games I've played. Hacking and slashing and laughing my *** off enjoying all its violent cartoony glory. I haven't had a chance to play this in multi-player as of yet but seeing how the game is just in solo I can only imagine the mayhem and entertainment this game could provide.

Great game! 10/10"
22635,Really fun and well made.
22636,"Its amazing to play with some of your friends. You each pick a character and level yourself up. Took a while to beat which is good. Has a ton of characters and variety of powers.

22642,Its pretty good
22643,This is honestly my favorite game with its long list of unlockables and use of many game mechanics.

22649,BEST GAME EVER SO AWSOME TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
22650,Dis game is so good. It is quite violent but not realistic. I would give it a 9/10. I would reccomend the age for 8 to 19? Thats all.
22651,"Not as good as I had hoped. but that's just my personal opinion, as I dont like these platformer/dungeon crawler type games. From a technical standpoint though. It is very refined and easy to get into, while also serving a healthy dose of challenge. Art and story are a riot."
22652,I recommend playing this friends! Playing this by yourself can be fun too but I found that it could get tedious and annoying in more difficult parts. The music is amazing and the fighting is fun.
22653,It's fun.
22654,This is one of those games that you invite your 3 friends over for early on a Saturday and play through until it's done.  It's one of the best 4 play co-op games I have ever played.  Anyone I introduce it to seems to enjoy it as well.
22655,Its a fun game amazing experience with friends but you know if you have terrible connection for online be prepared for lag but anyways aside of that the game is fun and characters are interesting in there own ways and thanks for remastered!! Also if you want to play this game with me ask me anytime :)
22656,SPAM SPELL= WIN
22657,It's so simplitically brilliant. I fully recommend this game. But don't play it without friends; you will get bored.
22658,From the boys on Xbox 360
22659,"One of the best couch co-op games on Steam. 

Highlights:

- Noob friendly
- Awesome visuals
- Sometimes funny
- Level up your character
- Change your characters weapon
- Buy potions, bombs, bread etc.
- Change your characters pet (gives player a bonus)
"
22660,"honestly one of the best games out there. Played the crap out of this on xbox, moved on to pc a few years ago and then my friend bought me the game, its really just as fun and replaying the game over and over never gets boring. Buy this game asap!

9/10"
22661,"Castle Crashers is a 4 player, side scrolling beat em up action RPG. You choose from an increasing variety of unlockable characters, each of which has their own unique magical abilities, and beat everything in your path to death through a lengthy campaign that puts old beat em ups to shame. 

This game is amazing, the graphics look good,the fandom is good, the gameplay is solid, and most importantly the Deviant Art community has disturbing (beautiful) af fan-art. 

I would highly suggest buying this master piece of a game."
22662,best game ever
22663,Play this game with your dudes and thank me later.
22664,"This is a great game if you friends.
However...
If you're like me you have to resort to online matchmaking.
Chances are that you'll get terrible ping matchmaking that results in ""Waiting for other players"" every 4 seconds.
Otherwise, Great game!"
22665,I want to play again
22666,gud game for 1 day lel
22667,An amazing co-op beat-em-up which reminds me of Golden Axe.
22668,"Great game, even after all this eyars its always fun to come back to it with some friends, some old-school beat-them up"
22669,"I've been playing this game for a long while on my XBOX360 and when I finally switched to PC, oh god, gaming at 144 FPS and 144 Hz refresh rate is something worth the price.

PLOT 8/10

This game offers really nice plot, where your goal is to bring four princesses back to king, also, in order to achieve this, you'll have to beat the guy who stole ""gem of power"" from the king.
During the gameplay there will be few bosses, of course by the time they will be harder to beat, but they ain't that hard, if you're an average player it will take you approx. 5-6 tries.
The only thing that annoys me is repeating scheme of plot and levels, lil' thing but makes huge impact on final rating.

GAMEPLAY 7/10

Gameplay is really flawless, when you play the game you want to complete ""just one more level"". Castle Crashers are built in a specific way, by that I mean that you will complete this game few times, due to unlocking new characters by each completion of game. 
Saddly same as previous, the gameplay is missing nothing but unrepeatableness.

GRAPHICS 9/10

Due to remastered graphics the game looks great on 21 inch 1080p display as well as on 22 inch 1440p display. Colors are perefctly maching the plot and the theme of levels, although they are a bit candy-ish, they are suitable for this game.
Playing with unblocked framerate is another great feature of PC edition, which makes it even more fun and enjoyable. 

AUDIO 7/10

There is not much to say, the audio is pretty average, as for an indie game it is good, but overall sounds aren't that great. If the soundtrack was worse in quality or less suitable, I'd rate audio even worse, but due to it suitableness, woah man, it really fits the gameplay.

OVERALL 8/10

Reasumming, Castle Crashers is title which I can recommend for families, for friends, who want to kill some bad guys, or just for casual players who like scroll-type action games. Nice feature is also that some of paid DLC's became part of standard digital key. Also the remaster works really well, even better on good-performing rigs.
I really enjoyed playing it for this short while, but as I know the game from console edition, I can give it rating of 8 with full confidence. 

I really hope that this review helped you :D"
22670,Very Very good and funny game and the best soundtrack :D.
22671,"fun game to have a chill session after work back at home
i can only recommend this game :)"
22672,Fun.
22673,"I love this game so much. I used to play it on the Xbox 360 with my friends and my brothers. This game is one of the most interesting game I have ever played in my life. Saving princesses, fighting different creatures and villians. Most of all this game is something you don't see everyday in the game stores out there. And I would recommend this game to everyone. Because who doesn't love humorous plot twists and adventures across the land."
22674,Game is really fun to play. Give it a try
22675,damn this game is good (just buy it)
22676,"Even after many years, castle crashers is still a great game. Fun gameplay with an amazing coop makes this game a must have in my opinion. There are many unlockables, characters to unlock, and a insane mode for more experienced players that make the game have good replay value. Grinding doesn't feel task which is a good thing since there are multiple ways of farming gold and exp. One of the best part is playing with a friend, which can be played locally and online. All the bosses are very unique with interesting mechanics for the most part.
 
9/10. Fun gamplay, fun bosses and good replay value"
22677,"Simple design and lots of fun. That's a very on point description for this game. As you first play you may think it's going to be a simplistic and boring game, but as you play you find out how entertaing and fun it can be. Both singleplayer and multiplayer are great, you'll enjoy playing it again and again."
22678,"This game is the best thing that has ever happened to me. Its full to the brim of humour (poo deer), crazy and strange characters and lots of rage inducing levels that stress you out to the point where once you finally beat it, you dance around the room crazy. I highly suggest this game if you wann have a good laugh with friends. Well done Behemoth on another fantastic game! :3
(green knight FTW)
10/10 will play many times again."
22679,While the game is fun i cannot overlook how terrible this port is. Constant stuttering and bad controller options. I advise you not to buy this unless it’s on sale and you are ready to do some tweaking
22680,STILL A GREAT GAME
22681,It's Incredibly fun to play with your friends.
22682,Simple game with fun characters. Easy controls so great to play with younger kids and challenging enough to not make it a cakewalk. Fun game for zoning out and killing some time or play with family/friends.
22683,Best couch co-op game ever.
22684,"This game is classic and challenging, i am played with my firends for 10 hours, The story is interesting. Then final boss is so diffcult to defeats him, we almost die over 30 times. If play myself, i would get stuck be honest. Try this with your firends!"
22685,This game is great for playing with friends
22686,Nothing like mowing down zombies in the most halarious ways possible to keep the gravy train rolling.
22687,"Ah Castle Crashers, I had such fun playing in the dorms on my old 360. So when i saw it was on sale, I grabbed it for old times sake. My brother did as well, and we quickly got a online co-op game going. 

Things were fine for about an hour, and we got to the first cave where you fight the slimes, and things fell apart. We were completely desynced as far as location, movement, levels, kills, enemies. We might as well have been in completely different games. Which would have been fine, had the screen not been following both of us still. We couldn't progress without telling the other person to run to the right. We struggled on until we killed the bomb-throwing boss, and survived the carriage ride through the woods, but by then we were out of health. I died, and went to the stat screen, and my brother just kept on fighting. I was stuck at that screen and couldn't do anything. Occasionally he would be able to move his cursor and allot skill points, but was unable to exit the screen.

All in all, it was unpleseant, frustrating, and just left us feeling bored and done. The game is still fun, but apparently the online syncing is not great. I'm sure the local play is just fine, but I'll have to try that out later. 

TL,DR: This is a very noticably poor PC port of a very fun game."
22688,"Great game... For local co-op or xbox 360, for online multi player, bad. The connection got so terrible and then never fixed itself, he was always one encounter ahead or behind me. And we had to tell each other when to move right or left to advance. It started happening during the Pip'n something cave with all the bats, it sucked. I want to say I love this game and I do but not being able to play it over online makes me have to say no, sorry. I'll have to return to xbox for this classic."
22689,Ridiculous
22690,Fun to play with your friends. going rampage until the end of the day XD
22691,Seru buat main game ramean sama temen2 untuk 4 players
22692,hmm
22693,I love the art style and the game i used to play it on my ps3 and loved it. So i decided to get it on my laptop. Im enjoying it alot and would recommend!!! :D
22694,This besta co-op
22695,beri naice
22696,"Kill the bad guys, save the princess, beat the shit out of your friends and score some royal booty. 

all this in more when you don't just crash the party; you crash the castle."
22697,fire
22698,poop funny
22699,Spectacular fun with friends.
22700,This game is very entretaining and if you play it with friends i'ts even better.I've spent a lot of time playing it and I think i'ts worth the money.
22701,This game is a great way to play and enjoy games with your friends or even just have a casual gaming session.
22702,This game is great. Too bad you need friends to get the most out of it
22703,"Even though I only have four hours on steam, I have completed this game on normal and 'heroic' from my Xbox days. Castle Crashers is blast with four people. Everyone can choose a Knight and save a princess! Make sure you get the last one! Combat is hack and slash with some combo elements. Try expierementing with different ordering and you will be bound to find new ways to play. For a simple looking art style, this game takes core game design to an impressive level."
22704,Best if played with friends but still a great game if you're looking to just have fun
22705,well... it costs only 3$ WHY NOT!
22706,shits good man
22707,very nice
22708,The game is still fun after beating it a few times because your friends keep asking you to play it. I just wish they make more levels for this game or a Castle Crashers 2 would be awesome.
22709,good game
22710,Awesome co-op that never gets old. Great family game :)
22711,"The gameplay is easy, the story is entertaining. 
Well the overwhelming animations, short films during gameplay makes the anticipation much greater. 
 Altough its quite easy, and fun to play with your friends it can be challenging when you are doing expert mode alone. 

The game contains many unlockable charachers, which you can achieve by playing through the game with another characher.  Ofc, playing the same story for the 15th time gets boring, but cmon. I know you want those free characters."
22712,Its a very fun and nice game. I reccomend it to anyone who has nothing to do and just wanna kill some time.
22713,Great way to spend a few hours. Especially in co op. Lots to keep you entertained and coming back for more.
22714,Whacky and weird game that's even more fun with friends. So many weapons and pets to unlock; you'll have a good time with this one.
22715,very good and fun game
22716,This game is pretty fun and challenging at least on your own. With a group of friends this game is an amazing experience. You also can see who better as a fighter or you can be the asshole who uses a potion and have no honor. Either way this game is 8/10 in my book.
22717,Lit game!
22718,"This game is super fun, and I highly recommend it more with friends."
22719,this game is the best game ever
22720,best game for play with friend
22721,okk
22722,"Good game to play with friends or even alone. Funny to take the most loot and leave none for your friends, esp when they died before the boss was killed HAHA jokes"
22723,Great game to play with friends!
22724,AWESOME!!
22725,killing boy go to town mini disco volcano shut up
22726,"Castle Crashers....
i really like this game because
level up system
weapons and combos
multiplayer 
difficulty 
game modes (wish there was more)
the theme of the game and the bosses.
overall its just fun.
Thanks DaGhost

10/10
recommend to all who like BBT and even Brawlhalla"
22727,One of the best games on steam and funniest plays really well but I recommend using a controller preferably xbox 360
22728,A great game for hack n slash type also a great game for two player.
22729,"A game that is cute and fun as well as hilariously slightly gross at times!  Loads of fun to play as single-player and cooperatively.  Great sideways scrolling, the different possible characters have a nice variety, and the collectible assistant pets are a fun accessory for your castle crasher in their crashing."
22730,This game is graet!  Well done and its fun to play with friends or after a long day;)
22731, no one play with me
22732,Vido ganes
22733,"heeeeyyyy...thats pretty good

"
22734,"Oldie but a Goldie, if you miss ""old"" newgrounds then you should give this game a try"
22735,Everything about this game is fantastic. The Behemoth is fantasic. People who play this game are fantastic. Now stop reading and go kiss a princess!
22736,cmonn man this game is fun games..
22737,its such a good game
22738,Much fun with friends. Love the humor
22739,Great game I would recommend this game to everyone. nice game to grind with your friends on.
22740,Really like the part where you ride a sharting deer
22741,"Great Game. It get's a quite repetitive over time but if you play it with friends it's always a blast. 

I played this on Xbox and I'm glad it's on Steam now."
22742,Best Havoc wIth Friends EVER. Worth every cent.
22743,Great solo and co op options. Good replayability to open up more characters. A little repetative.
22744,"This game is Amazing
If you wanna play something with your friends then Try this game
It´s more fun if you play this with you friend."
22745,Funny And Fun Thats All I Have To Say
22746,"Very Good Game, multiplayer makes the game 100% better giving more oppurtunities to play with friends. The different levels are even better with friends."
22747,I love this game and everything it stands for.
22748,It's funny how Behemoth games always increase on quality whenever they release a game.
22749,"I can't believe a game so old, still gives so much fun 
Having Withcher 3, System Shock and other great games, I keep playing this newgrounds gem."
22750,It was fun while it lasts
22751,"Castle Crashers is amazing, it isn't the best game I've ever played, it's flawed. But it's still awesome, I bought this game for 5 dollars while it was on sale and I was blown away by it, it's a ton of fun from start to finish, I've beaten it twice, once by myself and again with my brother, I thought he would hate it but he was addicted to it! We both had a great time and his reaction to the ending was priceless, I don't like Beat Em Ups so I don't know why I even bought this game but I have absoloutely no regrets. I reccomend this game to everyone, and if you're still skeptical about buying it, wait until it's on sale. I promise you won't regret buying this wonderful game."
22752,"great game highly recomended
"
22753,just buy it!
22754,"This game is one of my favorites from my console days.

It's not only silly but it is addictive.

Think an endless sidescroller with infinite amounts of fun and tons of hours of unlocks, humor, and killing.

It's dark humor not only got me back then on PS3 when the game released, but still even to this day cracks me up.

I got several of my friends to get the game and 1/6 say it sucks, the rest have a ton of fun with it.

This review is coming from a diehard RTS/Tactical FPS gamer. 

NOTE: DLC isn't required because the game has plenty of variety or to have fun, but it sure as hell gives the game another two funny Knights to play as with their own unique items and magic!

10/10 for nostalgia!"
22755,"This is a very good game, espicially with friends
Graphics are great, the art style is very appealing, and all characters and bosses are very well made.
Some achivements are only possible with friends, which is a bit of a dissapointment, but all the other achievments are not too hard and a good challenge.

Overall, I give the game a 9/10.
If you have at least 2 other friends to play with, it is sometimes easier and more fun."
22756,BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEST GAME EVER I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!
22757,Great Family Fun!
22758,Great co-op even on 1 laptop.  On lan - its superb. A really great game.
22759,"This is a good game good music great graphics and I am glad I bought this game.

I would recommend this game."
22760,one of the best indie games i now
22761,"Nice game
"
22762,"Cool and fun game to play with frineds. 
Best experience with a controller.
"
22763,Good game for long periods of gaming nights
22764,"I would definietly play this game with my kid, although I'll probably take the controller away and ""show him"" how to play, ending up playing 5 hours without letting him do anything. Feelsbadman."
22765,"this game is pretty freakin EPIC. my gamer instincts are heightened because i played this with my fellow gammers. i can say that because ive p[layed this game that IRL i have""freakin leveled up"""
22766,"Amazing fun with friends, if only I was actually good at the game"
22767,"I have this game on my Xbox 360, and i have beaten this game several times. The only hard part I find in this game is the unique characters. The Full Moon level is horrid, and i despise it. In this game you play as royal knights that must save the 4 princesses from the evil clutches of the badies. Get this game, is good"
22768,4/5
22769,"10/10
"
22770,This game is awesome!
22771,Needs more castles
22772,nice gim
22773,This game is alot of fun with friends to grind out some bosses and finish levels
22774,"Even though you find yourself mashing the same buttons over and over again, it still gives an entertaining experience to have with friends and has a decent amount of replayability."
22775,Broke the X and Y buttons on my controller. 10/10
22776,this game may be hard but if you have the demo once ur donw with it you just are so hyped for the full game so i rate this like a 5000/10
22777,Only complaint I have is that the PC port was too lazy to put in PC keys in the tutorial of how to do things. All examples are with a 360 controller. Otherwise this is an excellent arcade chill out game
22778,"Love the game, very fun"
22779,"Played this game with a friend, pretty rad."
22780,This is a great Beat-em-up that will last a long time. You can unlock a veriety of charactors (But they only look diferent) as well as weapons and pets. The multiplayer capibilities are lacking for modern technology but it is still playable. Nonetheless it is a great experience everyone should have
22781,"I killed an Alien with a Rainbow, a Ninja with a penguin, and a Bear with some sort of pink bear.

11/10"
22782,big fun but if only better on keyboard.
22783,Has diarrhea in it.
22784,Lit Game
22785,"This game is basic as hell. However, killing people with a lollipop is oddly satisfying."
22786,"Runs very well on poor laptops, like my own. Somewhat addicting and replayable time and time again. 10/10 boi"
22787,this game is fantastic! the graphics quality and everything! its hard but with friends its challengeing tons of fun and diffucult! i highly recommend it!
22788,"Nominatd for an award this time around.  One of the best Couch Co-op games on Steam.  Lots of fun, works great with Steam Link or Shield TV, provided you have the right vid card.  Very funny game too..."

22801,"The highly underrated side scrolling beat em up game. Fun for all occasions, and highly competitive."
22802,"Extremely fun game to play... with friends
If you're alone it's not as fun
I would still recommend though"
22803,"Odd in every sense of the word, but one of the best ""Beat 'em up"" games I have played in years!"
22804,im gay
22805,"Good, buy now."

22811,"This is one of the few games that allow you to beat the crap out of a gigantic dragon with a sock puppet using a fish, that is more than enough reason to play it"
22812,É bão!
22813,Nice and funny cartoon game :)
22814,gfhcj
22815,this game is the best
22816,This game is my most favorit game of all time but the theves are so dumb they just spam arows so you cant get up or hit them at all over the best game in the world even tho i got it yesterday
22817,Just play it with your friends
22818,Recommened to play with some friends. The game offers some funny moments and the kind of type to play is funny too.

22821,really good game
22822,Perfect Game for Couch Gaming or to play Online with Friends
22823,"Awesome, I have a great time playing it co-op
"
22824,"this is a very good game that i originaly played with my friends on the xbox 360 the graphics are amazing it has a odd but good storyline.

the only problem with it is if you are playing it online or with a friend it tends to lag a little nit but apart from that its amazing thank you who evers idea it was to make a PC version of this game."
22825,"anjay
"
22826,"This is a cool game, if you have someone to play it with"
22827,One of my favorite coop games :D
22828,fun
22829,"10/10 game, could not be happier for the price"
22830,is a good multiplayer game
22831,"Great game. I definitely recommend for people who love medevial themed games and games that include button mashing or combos. The characters in this game are wonderfully designed, and the game itself has a lot of character. Is a good game to play over and over, as you unlock different characters by doing so."
22832,"This game is cool, lol."
22833,Fun game to play with your friends...beware of them though.
22834,A great game this game is way better with friends! :D
22835,Absolutley one of the best games in history
22836,Brain dead fun game.
22837,Always have and always will love this game!
22838,My friend shared this with me and it's in my top 3 games but it gets unshared every month or so. so i'm just buying it today.
22839,"Castle Crashers is truly a game that one should play with friends.

Even though it can get repetitive playing through the story multiple times with different characters, it is still great, because you can decide to invest differently in each character and use their magical powers in different ways than previously thought.

It can also get really competitive with friends, and you can fight with them and against them as you go through the story and attempt to obtain the princess's kisses!

All in all, even though it seems repetitive, there is much variety within that. That and its crude humour is what makes this game truly enjoyable."
22840,This Game is so FUNN Get it its worth it even in full
22841,Best platformer NA.
22842,Beat the game with good majority of the unlockable characters on Xbox 360 really enjoyed it so many times I'd play with friends overall 9/10
22843,best game to play with friends
22844,This Game's A BLAST
22845,Its pretty neat.
22846,"You got friends? Get this game
You got family? Get this game
No friends? Get this game
No family? How the hell were you born?










Also get this game.
"
22847,So much fun to play! I beat it and had a really fun time doing it!
22848,best game ever cant stop playing it
22849,Great game
22850,I rate this game 10/10 for the green seahorse
22851,"The gameplay is really fun, but only if you have a controller. Good luck using a keyboard"
22852,10/10 good game
22853,Yes.
22854,"Great game!
I have played through this game several times now, and will continue to do so.
Great game to play with friends.

Love it!"
22855,"Best fun you can have with friends, top notch humor and gameplay :D"
22856,qka chill igrica
22857,Played this game for a while and i love it. I keep re-playing the story as i love it and different characters make the story seem different.
22858,Great game with friends 10/10.
22859,YES YES YES
22860,<3
22861,yes
22862,very good and nostalgic

10/10"
22866,GUD
22867,"I honestly can`t believe I haven`t reviewed this game yet. Ah Castle Crashers, how many hours have I spent Hacking-and -slashing away gleefully with friends and family on the xbox 360, only to buy it on PC and do it all again. This game is amazing. and the 3 dollars I payed for it is nothing compared to the laughs I`ve had with friends while playing it."
22868,Great fun with a group of gopnik friends.
22869,The best
22870,"An excellent modern side scrolling beat ’em. Very fun in local co-op. Excellent controls, gameplay, and humor."
22871,Fantastic game highly recommend.
22872,I had a blast playing this game with friends it was fun....and it made us laugh and scream when we had to fight the bosses. i recommend this game
22873,makes u forget ur life problems
22874,10/10 best couch coop game ever =)
22875,test
22876,"Hra je zábavná, hlavne s kamarátmi ktorých nemáte.Môžete si to zahrať aj s bratom pobaviť sa pri tom, ale aj zanadávať si :D"
22877,"Castle Crashers is one of my favorite games of all time, it gave me hours and hours of fun (especially in coop) and I will explain just two reasons I strongly recommend this game.

1) Alien Hominid fans: I think I discovered this game kind of late (2011), when it was released three years before, and I noticed something familiar in it's artwork and pace. Yes, The Behemoth gave us Alien - which I played a lot with my brother when little -, and now they gave us this wonderful game.

2) A game for everyone: I played with my friends, with my girlfriend, and with my brother. Everyone loves this game! It's replayable, and the history is very funny (Behemoth-style). It's amazing how the game, after sessions of 10-15 minutes of hack&slashing enemies, makes us (playing coop) kill ourselves so one of us will kiss the princess!

Here and there I return to this game. It's fun, you just need a couple of controllers (up to 4) and that is it!"
22878,Good to relieve stress
22879,This game is awesome
22880,"Addicting gameplay, multiplayer both co-op and vs (mostly local). laughting potentital OVER 9000!! filled to the brim of references, nice optimization for low spec rigs, I need to continue?

If you're a numbers person:

Gameplay: 9/10 - Needs a little tweaking if you're playing with mouse and keyboard, controller support only for XBOX 360 controller. Can be challenging or frustrating for casual players if played alone.

Graphics and Aesthesics: 10/10 - Perfect synergy between the comical tone and the 2D animations, silly emoticos and reactions from the NPCs.

Sound: 8/10 - The soundtracks lacks dynamism in some moments, and the fact that isn't score as a enjoyable album outside the game cost it a lot.

Plot/Narrative: 9/10 Very stereotypical history, save the princess(es) from the Big Baddy at the bat, no surprises there... but what is this...? a fight between our 4 heroes for a princess's kiss? Are you kidding me? AWESOMEEE PLOT-TWISTS!!.

Overall Value: 9/10 As a silly multiplayer 2D indie game is one of the bests of the market right now (with the other games from The Behemoth), it's excellent for videogame/fantasy/medieval themed parties, but I suggest discretion If you play this game with kids or sensible people around, it has some embarrassing moments. If you get this game and others from the same company, you will get special in-game rewards, so that's a plus. The DLC is there mostly for cosmetic purposes (The Pink Knight and Blacksmith are not THAT special).

Finally, this game earns my very-hard-to-get seal of BUY RIGHT NOW, YOU M""!·&""·$!""/)!!"
22881,Awesome Game. Must have for everyone who likes to play co-op with friends.
22882,Can't stop playing. This is the ultimate co-op game!
22883,"For an Indie games, this is one of the best games ever constructed and made. Castle Crashers brought me to the world of Steam (First game), and I will never forget that. Best INDIE game EVER!"
22884,Super cool game
22885,"Its cool like the graphics, gameplay and characters SOO Play this game NOOW!!"
22886,老汉推车
22887,"An enjoyable game with cute graphics, a funny, non-complex storyline, memorable bosses, a relatively easy to learn playing style, and a very nice soundtrack. It's better to play this with friends than by yourself, and a controller will make playing it easier. Glitches during co-op can get tiring."
22888,"Castle Crasher? Where do i even start. This game is amazing!!! I highly recommend buying this especially if it's on sale. The new interface, the new characters, and the better performance is oustanding. The best part is IT'S FOUR PLAYERS even if you don't have internet connection plug in 4 controllers and you're ready to play. I remember having the demo on xbox and always playing it. And it's even better on steam. Now get ready for a pros/cons list...

Pros-
-Amazing story
-combat is amazing
-the faces are hilarious
-four players online and offline
-never gets boring
-multiple weapons
-multiple bosses
-just amazing
-I realized that you dont need two controllers to play with two players!!!
-The graphics and animations are even better than before!!!

Cons-
-The story is too short




Summary= You should buy this game whenever you can it's worth the 15 dollars. If you are bored this game will satisfy you. AND WE NEED A SEQUEL TO THIS GAME. 11/10"
22889,Stab your enemies!  Stab your friends!  Win the princess!  Stab the princess!
22890,this game is guuuuuuu
22891,What can I say about this game.... nothing but praise that this game shows elegance and class in a game while capturing the elements of being a kid again. I felt like a 10 year old again being able to do dumb things while achieving and beating the challenging bosses.
22892,yes yes
22893,Yes good.
22894,"I loved this game when I was a kid, and you can be sure I still love it as an adult. 3.5 out of 5 stars."
22895,"Got this game on sale for practically nothing. I'm so glad I did. I'm really bad at platformers, but even then it's a lot of fun playing with my friends online. As we add more players, the lag becomes worse. This game is difficult in my opinion. Getting the last achievement in the survival game made me feel so accomplished.

Overall, I recommend this game."
22896,Great Game. Fun testing out the different mechanics of each character. Love to magic abilities of most characters. Been playing this game through the years. I always come back.
22897,Very cool!!
22898,"The game was really fun to play with friends, and I still play it, I installed it because I used to play with my friends on x box but now we live further apart. Overall I could easily recommend this game to anybody"
22899,"Great multiplayer co-op.
Also the pooping deer get me every time."

22922,"This game has been a consistent favorite of mine, and one that is super easy to play with nongaming family and gamers alike. :D"
22923,This game might be hard sometime it even give you challenge when you are playing alone but when playing with friend (if you have some compare to me) im sure it could be a excelent game to have fun on it with them
22924,10/10
22925,This game is absolutely ridiculous. Definitely worth a buy to play co-op with (can be done locally)

22940,Still fun as ever. Not pay2win like EA.
22941,Funny
22942,Top co op game easy to learn and play.
22943,Fun game that i play casually with my brothers. Got it on sale as a game to play inbetween games. Now i play games between castle crashers
22944,"Its says i review this game will complete a task
"
22945,"I played this when I was young and then I bought it when I was 12, I LOVE IT SO MUCH GO BEHEMOTH"
22946,Best with friends (:
22947,10/10 would buy again. Good game for singleplayer but better for co-op. Decent amount of content definitely worth the price.
22948,"it's great. you can't stop laughing.
for the greatest experience try playing with 3 other friends.
awesome."
22949,Great game to goof around with friends kinda random story things but thats what makes it a great game
22950,FUNNY GAME GG
22951,love it
22952,"Amazing masterpiece from The Behemoth.
The comedy is hilarious, the gameplay feels smooth and fair and the story is at lest a good one.
Castle Crashers is a game that I have played over and over and probably will several times more, with each completion giving you a new character with personalized magic to try out, an astounding amount of weapons and pets to collect, and lots of fun to be had.

"
22953,This one is very funny when you play together with your friend
22954,Nice story :-)
22955,"The perfect sofa game with a friend or your SO. Intense, funny and good mechanics. What more can you ask for?"
22956,very fun
22957,*A barbaric YAWP!*
22958,Time waster
22959,epic
22960,"Bought this on sale after hours upon hours put into my copy on the PS3.  A timeless co-op classic with such a captivating art style and a bountiful amount of characters to unlock and enjoy the game with.  Ranging from powerful magic to outrunning your friends to fighting with them AND against them, either in an arena or to kiss the princesses after a boss fight.  Recommended highly to use with a controller, but either way it lives up to its name years after initial release- an amazing and undying title!"
22961,nice
22962,"Great short fun with friends.
Low replayability unless you like collecting everything though."
22963,This game is super fun. I just wish I had some friends to play it with...
22964,love this game. Played it forever on the xbox. Now have a ton of time on the PC. Would love a part 2. well worth the money
22965,A lot more fun than recent multiplayer games.
22966,I love this game I play it almost daily! I might suck at it but it is so much fun!
22967,Played this before. Will play it again and in the future
22968,"Classic Newgrounds game.

The age of Flash is over."
22969,=D
22970,"it is fun to play with someone you love. This game is about whack em hard no matter what. But beware this game can turn your lover to an evil one.... because the gold and the experience her/his character get.
but overall its very good one for couch coop. no need an online multiplayer"
22971,F u n.
22972,Very good.
22973,killer of you time and controller
22974,Had a lot of fun playing on 2 player local co-op. Quite a variety of levels and gameplay mechanics.
22975,"Very fun, cute game to play with friends! I enjoyed playing it and always go back to start all over again. 10/10 would recommend"
22976,"31 Characters to play as, and a mode where everything is 10x  harder, the perfect challenge for any experienced gamer!"
22977,Best Co-op game
22978,A amazingly fun beat'em up with light RPG elements.   Great enemy varity and bosses.   A ton of fun with friends and best of all supports local coop.
22979,"I love this game, I played it nonstop during summer break with one of my friends and it went by FAST, We even beat the game! Now, we're going back and defeating it on insane mode! It is so fun, I would recommend it to everyone I know who has a pc or console. However, if you have a pc and have castle crashers on your desktop, watch out. Sometimes I try to click on it and it won't go into it. That is a warning. But other than that, I give this game a solid 10/10!"
22980,c'mon dude，let's make some noise
22981,"This game is insane. I love it so much and its producers. The Behemoth makes these games, and they may take a while to come out, but only due to the quality. I've bought all the dlc for this game, and don't regret it. No words to describe it. Just buy it. Buy it now."
22982,"(: I love this game! A true indie game master piece. Beyond worth the small price, and even well worth it at full price. Especially if you have friends to play this with on the weekends, you will have a absolute blast playing this game. Really is a true gem. Is it perfect, no not by any means. Will you absolutely love it! HECK YES."
22983,"Very Good if u like games ful of action.

a bit old timey. : )

"
22984,"Humorous! Enjoyed playing with friends moreso than solo. Either option is fine, but something about conquesting with friends is much more exciting... plus they're there to help bring your stupid butt back to life because you get in the heat of the moment too much and forget health bars exist."
22985,Super fun game to play with friends.
22986,"Game IS great many hours fan
Play alone or you and friends"
22987,great game
22988,Yes
22989,"Great game to play with friends or by yourself, full of adventure and cool characters. The boss fights are my favorite."
22990,"A good game to hang on with friends, also, insane mode is insanely hard"
22991,Great game to play with friends.
22992,"If you like beat 'em up style games, play this game.
 Don't ask, just play it."
22993,its amazing and has such a good campaing its really found to play with your friends!
22994,"A casual and fun party RPG that's definetly worth the full price of $15. If you're able to get it on sale, definitely buy it and 3 other copies and play it with your friends."
22995,beautiful game mouah!
22996,I am Spherical_Cheese and I approve this game.
22997,"It's an unbelievable game, it's a bit old, but it's one that I really do not get tired of playing and all the characters are charismatic even without doing anything."
22998,"One of the faves to play with friends! 
Even if they aren't gamers, it's a whole bunch of fun :^)"
22999,"Brings back nostalgia, great game for friends or even alone"
23000,"Played this on PS3 was pretty enjoyable
So based on that the PC version was also enjoyable."
23001,Hilariously dumb! Best played with friends to enjoy an over-the-top laughter!
23002,Great fun for a casual time-filler with friends.
23003,Remastered features are welcome but really need a sequel.
23004,kinda good
23005,The Remastered Edition seems to have fixed (or seemingly fixed) the connection issues that used to plague this game back in its early years. It's still a fun and goofy game to return to every now and then.
23006,awesome game
23007,Fun Coop
23008,"Very fun, and interactive game. Would reccomend to anyone. You just start with enter, and you enter a world of new beginnings, and gore."
23009,"really good gameplay so clever so current, better than what I expected"
23010,A game I could play again and again.
23011,Great game
23012,"This is actually a really neat little game that is highly addictive. There are so many different characters to choose from and if you have a buddy, the comedy is definitely different than most games. It's meant to be a bit cartoony and jokes probably appeal more towards children but I play it a lot for the fact that it's just a unique game. If you find yourself on trips and can't play games due to most games requiring a mouse, I tend to play this game often for that reason alone (track pad is bad for gaming in my opinion)."
23013,"10/10 would play again
"
23014,This game is so fun with friends. If it's on sale BUY IT. Jump before you spam that light attack to get massive damage.
23015,"The kiddos love this game. It's fun in general. Poop jokes, fart jokes, cartoon blood it's a great game for all."
23016,A blast for anyone who enjoys side scrollers.
23017,Great game to play with your friends.
23018,"One of the Best games to play in Local Coop 

A FUN and sometimes Challenging Game ! 
"
23019,oi
23020,"Really nostalgic game, finished it multiple times and had fun everytime I played it. A lot of fun if you play with friends!"
23021,"It may look childish with the humor and graphics, but it's a really good game especially with friends."
23022,This is an absurdly hilarious romp you won't soon forget.
23023,This game is mental! Love it!
23024,really good game.[but in multiplayer]
23025,This game is a masterpiece. The poop jokes will never fail you.
23026,This is a SUPER fun game and Playing it with friends only makes it better.
23027,"This game is okay, not the best, but ive seen worst."
23028,Strategy and fun to play with friends.
23029,Good game
23030,"crashing castles is fun
especially with friends

23038,this game is awesome
23039,"this game is for 4 player in order to be fun
so if you dont have some go out and meet new people before buying it"
23040,"Fun Co-op.
"
23041,"A fun couch co-op game. Simple, but with little things to find throughout the levels. You may also improve your character through level ups in this fun little beat em up.

The game reminds me of the old side scroll beat em ups of streets of rage and ninja turtles.

While not the greatest game ever, i quite enjoyed the nights of sitting with my wife taking out screens of eneimes and bosses together.

If there were a sequel, i'd pick it up."
23042,fricking love this game reminds me of when my furry friend used to play it with me what a dick he always used to use a lvl 50 character and stel all the princess kisses fuck u ian
23043,Nostalgia <3 Loved this game growing up.
23044,"Really fun ecspecially with friends, 9/10"
23045,Nice
23046,"10/10. graphics are charming story is simple, gameplay is simple and fun, and is challenging enough to be rewarding."
23047,Fun platformer
23048,94/100
23049,"People often say PCs are terrible at local multiplayer, but this game kicks it out of the park.  Played through the whole thing with my brother and had a blast.  Even the base game, which was only about 5 hours of play time with 2 people, was totally worth the money and we haven't even touched advanced mode or achievement hunting yet.

All in all a great local multiplayer experience!"
23050,fricken hilarious
23051,"A great game to play with your friends,or by yourself. it helps pass the time, and is worth your money. the dlc this game has are only a dollar each and include whole new aspects/abilities and more!"
23052,10/10 would leave their friend in a crashing UFO behind
23053,"If you like games like cuphead, you will have fun on castle crashers.
It's a classic in this video game genre.
You can redo the game so many time and still have a great time with your friends.

"
23054,It has drifting deers powerd by diarrhea.
23055,nice game
23056,"You kill thousands of people but its in medieval times so its honour not mass murder, and it has the replayability of sex."
23057,"Old school classic side-scrolling beat em' up action at it's finest! High resolutions, 4K supported well, and it looks great! My young son loves this game and we still play it quite often. Has cloud save support now and is well worth the purchase."
23058,"Very fun to play with your friends. NEVER play alone. Boring if you play by your self. If you have even only one friend, it is way more fun. Fighting for kisses and fighting together, definetly a game to play when you have a small party over, and your bored."
23059,good game but too short
23060,I love this game some times it makes me rage but great game overall :)
23061,"i don't even. it's a hard game, i'll tell you that. or i just suck."
23062,fun but short game
23063,"Guys... I mean it, this game is foreal the greatest game I have played! I would give it a 9/10.... BUTT! If you play with friends, it's gotta' be a 11/10

Btw don't mind the hours... I had over 1200 on my Xbox"
23064,"Epic game, i play today and i rlly like this game :D
I now playing insane mode :) with friends"
23065,this game is fun try to beat the boss final level.
23066,wasted money i got borderlands 2 game of the year edition for less >:( 1 star!
23067,A very fun game if you have a couple friends to play it with.
23068,"It's a really good game. The story is good and the graphics are even better, and the online gaming option improves in every way. I recommend this game to anyone who is in doubt about buying it. It's really sensational!"
23069,best game ever made
23070,A very very fun game Recomended if you have more friends that own this game cuz its so much fun on multiplayer and its verry funny gamr but not so challenging but it can be
23071,"Do I have to say anything? Its the Behemoth! So fun to chop people to bits, Take down massive bosses, And make-out with princesess!"
23072,gr8 game
23073,"I really enjoy and hate this game at the same time :D 
It's a hack and slash dreamland with, annoying to beat but great to defeat boss/mini boss levels. 
I love the characters and the gameplay is fast paced... and so far I don't think I've gotten bored once. 
I keep coming back to it as I can play casually or get really into it. 
Haven't tried playing with friends yet but I probably will I imagine it's great fun for that. 
9/10."
23074,"I always remember playing this with my little brother a long time ago and then I found it on steam again! This game is hilarious and so much fun to play. I would definatly recommend, it can be fun playing with friends or alone :D Though I suggest playing with friends."
23075,"I've wanted my son to get into games and had him dabble with the likes of Mario since he was 3. He liked them, but none really took to the point he wanted to play alone. A couple years later enter Castle Crashers. I didn't realize it until we started playing more, but it really is the perfect gateway game for kids to learn gaming concepts. I realized we're starting from scratch here, so even the concept of health was new. In the few weeks we played he's learned the following from Castle Crashers:

-Menu Navigation (understanding that certain buttons or text will get you where you want to be and start the game, choosing a character, etc.)

-Movement (basic navigation of the levels, getting to and facing enemies to attack them or avoid their attacks, jumping)
Combat (understanding X is light attack, Y is heavy attack, RTrigger activates magic in combination with other buttons for different effects, LTrigger to block and knowing when blocking is needed)

-Health (both losing it and dying or using potions or eating food to restore it)

-Magic (being aware of your mana bar and when you run out you can't cast till it regens)

-Leveling (becoming stronger, increasing stats, reaching a level to be able to wield certain weapons)

-Currency (earning gold and affording new weapons and items)

-Items (understanding you have a variety of items and cycling through them with the shoulder buttons. Using the bow and arrow on a boss or using items at appropriate times, like beefing up your character with a sandwich to tear down an otherwise impassable wall. Which leads to..)

-Gating (understanding you need certain items to unlock gated areas which stop you from progressing. like the 3 items needed to use the boat and get across the ocean. understanding where those items are or what boss on what level possesses them.)

-Companions (pets and their passive abilities)

-Unlocking Characters (understanding you have to beat the game with one character to unlock another)

He'll now be able to reference everything he learned in this game as a foundation to pickup other games. On top of all of that, the art style is fun and very slick. The animations are smooth and the controls are responsive. The story is pretty basic (save the princess, kill the bad guys) and it's easy for them to understand the motive. It's also very repeatable. The icing on the cake is you can coop with them to enjoy it together or help them through it. So if you're looking for a game to play with your kids and you don't mind a bit of cartoon violence Castle Crashers is an excellent choice. If anyone has a similar experience with this or another game with their kids, please share."
23076,"This game is damn fun. Cartoon slasher. Super easy to get into, and great for a small group of friends who are either Gamers, or casuals."
23077,"Great game to buy en masse during a sale and gift to friends.
"
23078,fix online plz
23079,great spastic game with great bosses i would give  it a 7/10. also great for older and smaller children ages 4 to beyond
23080,"Recommended to play with friends, singleplayer is mostly a lackluster experience."
23081,"If you aren't that mature then this game is perfect. But if you ARE mature you'll still like it.
\(^.^)/"
23082,10/10 would kill over 9000 barbarians again.
23083,"One of the best modern beat em' ups out there. Although I suggest waiting until it goes on sale and buy a four pack. It's a party game, therefore only half the fun when you play alone."
23084,"Bets game ever
\"
23085,haha juggle go brrrr
23086,"Great game, fun to play with friends."
23087,Yes

23098,"Amazing Game, Great Co-Op, Pretty 2D Graphics, Funny Stuff. (Owl Is Pooping On You)

My Score: [b] 9/10 [/b]"
23099,"A timeless XBLA classic made even better thanks to being ported to PC. With the 2015 update, the game has received two much needed upgrades: 60fps and an ultra graphics setting, the latter requiring some hardware beef. It's $3 on sale, do give it a try. And bring friends, too!"
23100,Pretty good for an excellent price.
23101,Its Just Like Dark Souls
23102,I love this game I wish I had the two dlc packs🤔

23114,poop deer 10/10 best game would buy 100 more copies
23115,"I loved this game. My friend bought this for me a while back, (when you could buy a 4-pack for $1) and we played for hours on end. We had a blast and continuously playing the game on and off and in total, beat the game around 6 times before calling it quits. This game has amazing sprite work and it's different heroes and their abilities, really bolstered the amount of times you can beat this game. Another amazing game made by one of my favorite studio's. 11/10 would recommend."
23116,best
23117,good game
23118,theres 1 castle in the entire game thats crashed
23119,"Good and then bad:

[*] Best played with multiple friends so that it becomes a clusterfuck
[*] Different characters, weapons, pets, enemies, level upping gives choice
[*] Fun PvP
[*] Cartoonish graphics
[*] Poop
[*] Use controller

[*] Bosses are kinda dissapointing
[*] Music get annoying fast
[*] Repetition"
23120,"Funny game, great to play co-op with a couple of friends."
23121,"I have been playing this game since i was about 6 or 7 years old. I love it and I would love to show support for the newgrounds and behemoth team. For its time it was an amazing game, me and my cousins have tried to all beat the game in 1 seating but we failed. We only got to lava world but hey, we had a lot of fun. I recomend it to anyone that likes game where you can level up with a bit of cartoon."
23122,"Great Game! It plays well, great if you have a controller to hook up to play and the best when in multiplayer! Can't wait to get DLC!!!"
23123,"very fun game thats been around for years, keep the game alive and buy it!"
23124,"Played trough this game 3 times by now

2/10 it ok"
23125,Good Sheeit Mane.
23126,"Pretty good. 

I'd play again."
23127,Yes
23128,"Great game that is a lot of fun to play with friends. For sure has a challenge to it, whether with friends or by yourself. Worth every penny when you catch it in a steam sale for discount. Definitely worth that nostalgic buy, for a throwback to my days on xbox."
23129,Fun
23130,"not for people who dont have frends 


overall, there is only one flaw in the game. The industrialist is so fucking broken."
23131,"beat this game on xbox 360. bought it on steam again because no longer use xbox 360 and so able to play with my friends on steam. expect a lot of crude humor as the esrb ratings suggested. like poop, poop, riding a poop deer, bear taking a poop behind bushes and many more."
23132,"Why singleplayer bosses have the EXACT same status as multiplayers???
I'm going to give a like,though.

Restart playing fro 8/25/18.I was soooooooo boring.
The insane mode is definitely INSANE.
Get some friends and go rage!"
23133,Adorable and epic.
23134,Rawr
23135,It's good...but I got no friends to play with :((((((((((((((
23136,"Played the game originally on Xbox Live way back when, tons of fun then, tons of fun now.  Lots of fun to play with a couple of friends on all of your first play-throughs, after that you can just grind and mess around a bit, duel, etc.

If you buy this game on Sale, it is EXTREMELY worth it.  I'm surprised they never made a Sequel to this game (No, I do not count battleblock theater..)"
23137,"Humorous, creative, adventurous and challenging. Castle Crashers is the perfect game to play with other people. I strongly recommend this game if you haven’t played it yet."
23138,"Ok game for having a bad time. There are better repeatative games for you and your friends to play. Save your money, don't waste it on this."
23139,Made by the genius' who made battleblock theater and pit people. Exactly the right of mix of stupid and fun in order to be worth playing
23140,this is a really good gamem for familys to play together
23141,"Fun game, died off."
23142,had 55 hours yesterday and now i have 39 111/10

23145,"THIS WAS A GREAT GAME 

The story was excellent and the ending was absolutely hilarious with its Easter eggs Weapons and more enjoyable to play with a fun art style

however the price 9.99 is not worth buy it on sale;) and also play with friends for EXTRA enjoyment

OVERALL:9/10"
23146,"Really nice game, specially if you play it casual in the couch with a controller and other people."

23151,"I am very enjoyed this game.

Woooooooohhh!!!!!!!"
23152,Very fun to play especially with friends. Its cool playing different roles and builds in groups and fill your part. fun art style and humor. Fun and  creative bosses and enemies as well. Downloads really fast and loading times are very short. however as a small complaint it is quite hard to get a good game going with people other than friends randomly online
23153,BEST GAME
23154,"Haha what a funny deer, it keeps pooping. HAHAHA!"
23155,A must play with friends. Simply hillarious when played in a group lol
23156,"I would Highly recommend this game to all those who enjoy simple mini RPG like games. The game runs smoothly on nearly every computer out there so hardware is not an issue, the game has great controls, characters and bosses. The price is a little too high for the content it gives but on sale it's an easy buy."
23157,Such an awesome game I hope they add a new gamemode or new bosses soon
23158,"Its a really simple game with lots and lots of fun in it <3
There's a lot of potential in this game, I hope it won't be wasted~

Personally, I found it amusing to have an option to turn off the gore, LOL~!
Its really a game that I can enjoy on my own, with friend, and with my family ..

Really recommended to play when you have nothing to do or stuck in boring gathering :P
Have fun~!"
23159,"very fun game to play , super fun if  play wit friends , good control, good graphics , awesome !!!! 10/10"
23160,"One of the most charming and fun-filled games I've ever played. The art is amazing, the controls great, and the learning curb small. I can play this with my nerdiest or least game-prone friends and have fun. There are tons of unlockables and loads of replay value. One of the best buys you could make."
23161,woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
23162,"This game is honestly halariously fun. Although I have the worst internet possible, but that doesn't stop the flow of fun."
23163,"Fantastic homage to the classic beat-em-up. Great with or without friends and lots of stuff to do, easily worth the full price."
23164,"This game is SO much fun! I've played it on my Xbox but it crashed and when I got this computer I was lokking for games and remembered Castle Crashers so I downloaded it (after paying) and started playing it! I highly recommend this game id your looking for something new to play! -spdhunter over and out, PEACE!"
23165,"I rate Castle Crashers a 9/10.



Pros:

- The art style is fun and bright.

- There's lot of replayability.

- The boss fights are fun and enjoyable.

- You have 31 characters to play with, as long as you unlock them.

- There's many easter eggs.



Cons:


- To truly enjoy this game, you need friends. In my playthrough of it, I played with 2 others.

- At points you may need to grind for money and experience, maybe once or twice and not for long.

- Short: I finished the game in 11 hours - I think.


Conclusion:


I recommend that you buy this game, however buy it while it's on sale as I don't believe the price tag of 10.99 (I think) is worth it.



(bought for £1.99)"
23166,Best lan game you will ever find xd.
23167,Fun to play with friends!
23168,"I really loved the simple mechanics of the game and the skills varies with charcters u pick, customize your statistics and as you process you get stronger. However the most challenging thing in the game is the single player campaign. I don't have friends to help me out and Multiplayer games was ssometimes frustrating since the search queue is really long and when u join in the game and play. Suddenly you get kicked out for particular no reason. Other than that you can solo the game and I really enjoyed playing it. Worth it"
23169,Was skeptical at first but It's a really fun game if you have someone  to play with. Like insanely fun. The online scene is dead however so I would only recommend this game to people who have someone else to play with.
23170,The game is well made making so you can do the campaign each time but as the different character that stood out to me the most then adding in battle block characters if you have the game was cool i also liked the bosses you created even though they made me rage alot but also having the knights always die sucked but i loved barbarian back off that was the first thing i played and i loved it then the arena was fun i tried using magic so i spammed every button while holding e anyways i recommend this game its one of my favourites now!
23171,"This game is currently my favorite game of all time i have over 700+ hours across every platform basicly if you can afford it get it. It will not dissapoint.

P.S there is poopjet deer how can you say no to that"
23172,"Is good
I got it for 3 $ because of the halloween sale XD!!!"
23173,Classic game
23174,"This game is fucking fun ass hell
"
23175,juggling mechanic is fun
23176,"I love this game i may have only played the first 5 levels but i can tell this game is amazing 
When i was a kid me and my sister had an x-box 360 we played the demo of this over and over again and now i have the full verison and i just want to say it is for sure worth the price."
23177,"I've been playing this game since it came out on the Xbox 360's store in one of the ""arcade"" games, and I bought it on PC a few years ago and still find it fun beating the story and juggling enemies. The only major downside to this game is the multiplayer, the netcode is awful even for P2P, but if you can deal with some input lag and freezing sometimes, then it'll work."
23178,"Castle Crashers is a co-op arena game. You can play it alone, but playing with 1 to 3 friends locally or online makes the experience a lot better. The controls are very good, i enjoyed it equally on keyboard and controller.

     At the start of the game the kingdom you serve gets invaded and the 4 princesses are stolen along with a big crystal. You (and your friends) go on a journey to become stronger, win money, fame and the princesses' hearts. There are a lot of jokes and some references.
The game looks good, it reminds me of the games i played on Newgrounds a long time ago like Dad 'n Me or Alien Hominid (The alien is also a playable character here). The games are old (2001-2005), but they are the start of everything, if it wasn't for them Castle Crashers 
wouldn't be here today. It got nice soundtrack that helps building the medieval atmosphere. 

     The gameplay is fun and you can personalize it in the stat increase and by using different characters. You initially only have 4 characters (+2 if you own the DLCs) and win other characters during the game. Characters got a specific weapon, different magic and sometimes unique animations. Weapons got stat buffs and sometimes debuffs to balance it. As i said, you can increase your stats with points you get from leveling up after you complete a mission. You can increase strength for more melee hit damage, magic for magic damage and recharge, defense for more health and less damage received and agility for faster bow shots and speed. I highly discourage upgrading strength, note that you get xp for every hit, not damage. More damage kills the enemy faster and brings less xp, i wish someone told me this when I started the game. It is better to hit the normal enemies a lot, and if you want to take bosses more easily upgrade your magic and use it to damage. The best place in the game to farm xp is [spoiler]in the forest, at the black monster boss that spawns minions that look like him[/spoiler].

     Even if it's a hack and slash game, you should use combos sometimes. They don't only make you look cool, but they also can do a lot of damage, or you can just jump and spam light attack in the air (It's a pretty tiring way of playing though).
The optimization is great, you can play it on most computers. There are a lot of weapons and pets to collect and characters to unlock. It isn't a very hard game, but neither boring-easy. You can also make it harder by playing ""insane mode"", which you unlock after completing the game and it basically makes enemies a lot more tanky and to deal more damage.

23179,When I play this game I always laugh and have fun! And I recommend this game for groups of people. If you have about three or two friends (or just one) it can go really well! and the two other game modes are awesome! And I've wanted this game for about four years and now I got it because the sale! Keep it up The Behemoth! And also thanks for putting this on sale Steam!

23184,One of my favorite games. Endless replayability and new characters make it great.
23185,Awesome game
23186,"For hours of entertainment you can't go wrong. Try to pick it up when it's on sale. Game is short, but has replayability. Once you unlock insane mode that is where the fun starts."
23187,"Still best on Xbox 360, but still amazing"
23188,11/10 Would Co-op

23192,"Be Frankly, im refunded this game, not because i dont like it, its just too many mulitplayer games i want to invest my times with... this is just not worthy of my times.. but worry not.. it is great games.. recommended for a family to play with their kid.. still this game so cute and funny"
23193,"A lot of a fun with friends!
"
23194,Top Game
23195,eh got bored within a minute that i played this cheap game
23196,Very nice game
23197,It says it recommends controler and I understand why but it is definately still playable with keyboard. The online multiplayer it is a bit hard to find people on there but singleplayer is really good and I definately recommend this game.
23198,Foking nice
23199,"THIS GAME IS LIT A.F
-Bucket"
23200,Very cool game if u have friends to play with
23201,Great game! I would recommend this game to anyone! Love the cute art style and the simple gameplay.
23202,"Castle Crashers, the most simple beat 'em up that  will never bore you. With a large variety of characters ranging from a necromancer to a murder-crazed-bear with all unique abilities the game is as replayable as can be. Although an experienced player could complete the game in about 5-7 hours, you can really take all the time in the world, farming for pets, weapons and experiance, all of which there is alot of. Often with beat 'em ups there is a dull feeling after you have killed people for the millionth time, but due to the levelling and combo systems, the game is never dull and the way you fight can change depending on the weapons you use, the character you pick, what you upgrade and the pets you use. For example you could use your experiance to make you character a melee knight with alot of damage or defence. Alternatley some may prefer to use magic attacks or archery. This dynamic makes the game great for multiplayer, co-op or online, often i find myself using archery skills to defend my melee knight friends from a distance. Despite this it can definitley be fun to just sit back and play it by yourself as the game is very simple and in some instances you can play it thoughtlessly. With that said there is also an ""Insane Mode"" which is hard even for the most seasoned experienced player. But in insane mode there are 4 characters you can unlock by reaching far stages of the game, as well as this at the end of (almost) any playthrough of the game with every charcter, you unlock a new one, this encourages the player to replay and gives you more reasons to keep plaing the game. The pet system is also a complex thing that gives you another way to change the way you play, there are many pets and you unlock them through either finding them in a level, or buying them at a shop. These pets can give you abilities from shooting fireballs to jumping higher, there is a character for every playstyle and its fun to switch them up every once in a while.

As a final opinion, Castle Crashers is personally my favourite game of all time and I think it could easily be yours. 10/10."
23203,Best game EVER
23204,its good but to short
23205,Great game! very fun. I miss playing games like that one.

23209,"I can't tell you the amount of times I've played through Castle Crashers. It's a simple game, with a simple story, but expresses itself with such character. Playing it with your friends is always a good time! Distinct color and elemental variations has always been a weak spot of mine, and this game uses it really well. The game also has a lot of replayability, seeing as every time you beat the game with a character, you unlock a new character. Playing the game with different characters feels different enough to make another playthrough satisfying!"
23210,"it is a good game :)
"
23211,Love it
23212,"This is one of my favourite games of all time Andy it is just so much fun to grab a friend and play online or they can go to your place it doesn’t matter where you are you can always play split screen with a sibling or friend
"
23213,One of my favorite co-op games.
23214,"This is a fun game where you can play as lots of characters with different magic, but it can get a bit repetitive."
23215,how to lose your friends
23216,veri nice jes
23217,Thoroughly enjoyable game. Especially when played with a mate. Good for a few laughs but still quite challenging. Greta game!
23218,"I only have 2 hours on PC, but on Xbox 360, I had HUNDREDS of hours on this game. The default characters are kinda poo, but when youre max level, anything is OP in this game.
If you want tips for getting money, do the first boss a lot. About 2-300 gold every time, and its easy a heck."

23222,"Really good and cartoony game! I love the graphics so MUCH!! Totally reccomend this game 100%.
The only thing that irratates me is that u need to buy Battle Block Theather to unlock Hatty Hattington.

23223,side scroll beat em up....
23224,This videogame is a piece of cenamatic genius... One of the most creative and stylized videogames ever made.. it toastsssss... (92.5%)
23225,"Great game! I am having a ton of fun however sadly its really hard to find someone to play with. I see 500 people online but nobody is really doing multiplayer. I still recommend it! Its cheap, and its definitely going to give you a good while of fun."
23226,"The game is a lot of fun, and the online co-op is cool. They can play on your save and help you progress when you get stuck. Had seen little of it before I received it as a gift from my SO, so my knowledge is limited, but appears to be best suited as a co-op game. You get your ass kicked in some of the levels.

I HIGHLY recommend playing this with a controller. Keyboard controls are difficult."
23227,Such a good game :D
23228,"In the wise words of Reggie Fils-Aime
""the game--is fun.""

for sure worth the price, great with friends, dlc isn't that good though, pink knight helps a bit in co-op"
23229,the game is good its fun but i really wished the devs think something new to put in it
23230,This game is super fun. That's really all there is to say. It's better with friends so get a couple people to get it with you and you'll definitely have a fun time with it
23231,Castle Crashers is fun. I recommend playing with friends otherwise its too difficult if you play solo.
23232,It has great replay value
23233,Great for everyone appreciating some awesome and also a bit dark humor! Although you should have access to an xbox controller. Playing this game with a keyboard is almost impossible.
23234,"got 5 characters lvl ~ 30
still havent beaten the game"
23235,anyone wana play ill be green knight just repliy or add i am old to steam just made a new account so yea COMR
23236,THIS IS AWESOME AND SO VERY FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY!
23237,"Do you like motion sickness and 2 and half d? Hope you like full price New Grounds games. It's fun though, just dripping with 2012 dank memes."
23238,I found this to be a great way to play this amazing game since I dont own an xbox. The ingame purchases for extra content is a little much but I find myself going back to this classic time and time againd to get that perfect score on each of the characters.
23239,love it
23240,lol
23241,"Incredible concept!
Loved playing it with my cousin and brother back in the days... :/"
23242,"Amazing producers bring you this amazing game! 

Before anything, please play this game in its entirety with at least 2+ friends, playing it alone is no fun, especially if you have never played it before. I will admit, the game is very pricey, but along with the humours jokes in game, the combat system works well (only if you have a controller, Keyboard controls suck, and you cant change them), and a nice lengthy, challening campagin leads to good times! Its fun to just share stories and play this 'social game' with your friends!"
23243,"Very fun to play with friends.
Sadly I cannot get past that frikin beach ball because it's a freaking 2d game with 3d movements.
Altogether 9/10"

23251,fun...
23252,All characters should level through your account rather than separately.  The multiplayer achievements are dumb.  Everything else about the game is awesome including an unexpected trip to a flying saucer.
23253,Some serious multiplayer online issues. Pretty good though.
23254,Fun and easy to play with my girlfriend
23255,very fun and very positive community. even playing solo is very fun. it may be hard sometimes but it is certainly rewarding in its own way

You crash a castle."
23258,"Fun game, great when your playing Co-op, in short a more in depth hack a slash alien hominid with the same style of humour. Massive replayability and fun little mini-games. Play with friends as for some unknown reason not many people play this openly online."

23269,"The best beat-'em-up game of the 2000's. Still holds up today, though if you're looking to play online with randoms the player base may be lower than you'd expect. There was a period in 2009 when I would play through this game  with friends on Xbox Live every night, so that should say something about its replay value. Highly recommended both to fans of the genre and newcomers."
23270,gud game
23271,Very Fun with friends.
23272,Gudd game
23273,Is GoOd
23274,"Castle Crashers will provide you with hours of fun. Grab a controller and three friends in this beautifully illustrated beat em up. The Music is epic and the combat is sweet. The game is full of fun and humor. Try some of the Behemoth's other games as well, such as battleblock theater and Pit People.

Couch coop is the my main draw for this game, personally. And it's absolutely great at that. 
The humor and ridiculous scenarios simply add to the atmosphere making it a great time. 

If for some reason you still haven't played this, grab some friends and get to it.

23295,"Fuck volley ball.

Just a tip. Inlist a friend/""volunteer"" to finish the volley ball game. Unless you gain satisfaction in becoming an unending ball of hatred and rage. Then go ahead.

This game is good though."
23296,One of the best party/solo game out there! Played the crap out of this on 360
23297,it's gr8
23298,"This game is so much fun to play. This is the kind of game you pick up to play with friends when you want to relax and have a blast. The campaign was fun, but the story isn't serious, and shouldn't be taken seriously. The combat is pretty good, there's a lot of combos and special moves. It isn't really necessary to learn them all though, as you can button mash through like 90% of the game. You can play it with a keyboard, but it is much better with a controller and should be played with one. 8/10, not super complicated or intense, but definitely worth getting."
23299,"If you want just to kill some stupid warriors, it's really good :D don't expect very interesting story but good gameplay. You will probebly play this game for 50 hours or something like that. The normal mode is easy but if you want to complete insane mod - Good Luck!"
23300,"Jah
"
23301,"I use to mess around on newgrounds a lot when I was younger. Me and a friend decided to get this game to play together for the lulz. It was actually pretty fun, especially when I randomly learned how to juggle enemy for an insanly long time."
23302,"My fucking jew best friend played as a agility build and stole all the gold

good game tho
"
23303,"I HEAVILY recommend this for people looking for 4 player local or online coop experiences.

Wish there was more variety during the combat when it comes to using different sort of melee weapons, also different sort of bows, the progression feels good aside from that and you eventually do become stronger and stronger while you progress in the game, something really good.

The game has a pretty nice amount of content, with many levels with different enemy types, you might recognize many of them are just reskins but for the most part it works good.

The combat of the game, aside from what I commented at first, is pretty complex and cool, you can make many sort of combos which can be pretty useful depending of the situation.

The soundtrack is pretty nice, I really like it, some tunes are just really damn catchy. The art isn't bad although very flash like (Looks good but sometimes it bothers me), which is understandable since this game was made by typical flash artists back in the time.

This is a MUST play for every person seeking for a beat em up experience."
23304,"I enjoyed this game but I'll admit that the game feels a bit repetitive. If you like sidescrolling beat em' ups then you'll probably like this game. If you can, play this with friends."
23305,"A real fun and challenging game once you reach hard mode, more fun with friends."
23306,"Even after beating it on xbox 360, This games still has so much replay ability."
23307,"Very very fun, recommend %100 especially if you have siblings to play with"
23308,"A great party game with rpg-like traits. One of the greatest things about the game is that it teaches you how to respect your limits and learn from the ocasion, using pretty muche everything availiable to you."
23309,"This game is 10 fuking out of 10!
Always at some point I'm coming back to it over the years, witch speaks for it self."
23310,Fun game with a group of friends to hack and slash with
23311,"Fun and simple. Easy button-mashing combo-based play. Easy to pick up, easy to play. Simple and straightforward story line  / game progression. Downside is that the game is very repetitive and after you complete the story hardcore mode is essentially the same game but with beefier enemies. If you don't mind playing through a game once and/or grinding then this game is for you."
23312,If you like newgrounds and beating people up you'll love this game
23313,Make sure you have friends that will play this with you before you get it.
23314,"VEERY VERRY NOICE

23316,AMAZING fun! I play multiplayer games and dont really like singleplayer because I dont see me getting exited to play it after a while but this game's singleplayer is 1st place.
23317,"I got this from a friend, but i love it very much, the play style, its almost like an old arcade game, the side scrolling is perfect, it has its challenges, but come on, we are gamers, what would we do without a challenge or two, great game, highly recommended"

23325,"This game is amazing! The graphics are great and i love the animation! To new people, this is a great game and will be fun. LOVE IT!!!"
23326,"an amazing game that gave me hours of fun,it was one of the first games i played on steam and i'm still havign a lot of fun with it."
23327,"Utterly fantastic game; while I have only played for a short while on Steam, I have clocked numerous hours on both the Xbox 360 and Xbox One versions. Loads of fun, bring friends for even more; and be sure to give it your all when it comes to winning the kiss from the Princess!"
23328,"Quick-paced and satisfying hack-and-slash gameplay combined with an excellent OST and a distinct graphical style makes Castle Crashers an enjoyable experience, with a plethora of different characters to do muliple runs with to boot. Strongly recommended, especially when it's 90% off."
23329,"AMAZING game to play with friends! Cool artstyle, lot of funny moments, SURREAL story and EPIC boss fights!"
23330,DO NOT BUY THIS! 17.99 for a brocken game. Constantly lags in multiplayer so badly its unplayable.
23331,castle crashers
23332,"colorful
fun
best with friends"
23333,Nice game if you like mashing the keys on your keyboard until your wrist hurts. It's best played with friends... 9.5/10
23334,this game is absolutely amazing. reason 1 you can use cheat engine and mess around with that. reason 2 i played this game on xbox 360 and xbox one (whats not to like about this game) thank you for making this game behemoth
23335,Really fun co-op game that definitely needs a sequel
23336,"Got this on a sale, would have payed full price anyways"
23337,"Gráficamente las imágenes y videos que se pueden ver en la revista dan una idea de su corte tecnológico. No se trata de un videojuego deslumbrante en este sentido, pero su simpatía y delicioso diseño hacen que gane muchos puntos en este campo. Los diseños de los escenarios brillan a la misma altura que los de los personajes, y hay gran cantidad de objetos destructibles."
23338,"I've played this game for about 400 hrs on my xbox, def worth it, esp w/ friends"
23339,"The story of the game is about four knights trying to save four princesses from the bad guys, so epic uh ?
Pros:
- 2D 
- multiplayer (from 2 to 4 people can play)
- playable with controller 
- fine story mode 
- playtime to finish the game from 15 to 20 hours 
Cons: 
- at one stage of the game you will need to grind for a bit 
Final comment: 
Just buy the game on a sell and enjoy :)"
23340,"Now this... this is what i would call a masterpiece.
This game means alot alot alot to me, my uncle showed me it 6 years ago, i loved it and when i got home from russia i bought the game immediatly. I got level 99 with the red knight, and i have such good moments with my friends playing this game, if you haven't played this yet, go fucking buy it right now.

PROS:
- Fun and creative artwork
- Fucking fun as heck with your friends
- mature in a funny way
- You don't need any skill (except the hard mode that's so fucking hard)
- Variety of characters
- Alot of characters to unlock

CONS:
- The gameplay can become pretty repetitive
- Where is castle crashers 2?
- hard mode, is really hard

So yeah that's it, go buy the game right now."

23343,"yo, how are u suppose to survive for 2 minutes and 30 seconds in back off barbarian?"
23344,watch these boys go! play as a skeleton and a bear and fight all the goblins in the forest.
23345,"Great game with friends, you should use a controler!"
23346,One of my favorite local/online co-op games of all time. brings back memories of sitting around a arcade cabinet and beating the hell of out things for 1 quarter a life...but now i can have someone gimme CPR to keep me alive. 11/10 would take some mouth to mouth from clown princess again.
23347,"Great game from my childhood, game dev's please hook me up with pink and purle please :D <3"
23348,good game with a team
23349,First time I actually felt the urge to write a review. I played this game for 1.5 hours and i spent 1 hour of that being stun locked or getting knocked down. Might be better in multiplayer but in singleplayer its no fun at all.
23350,"I pressed one button, maybe 2 if I was lucky.





Still playing it."
23351,"Been playing since 2010 or so on the 360 with countless hours on it, and I can say without a doubt this is a 10/10 game, especially on local multiplayer."
23352,dis game kinda fun doe
23353,"a little bugy, but otherwise  its a good game"
23354,"I'm going through my entire library and putting a minimum of an hour into each game and then reviewing them, here is mine for Castle Crashers:

Let me start by saying the time I have in Castle Crashers is not accurately represented on steam.  I played this game so much on my 360 with friends in high school that I have every level memorized.  It is such a good time, but take friends. It can get kinda boring and samey if you are alone."
23355,"This game is fun, it has great cartoon desings with some good music. And lots of hilarious moments (you will be surprised a lot). It's mechanics ain't that good, and after 2/3 of the game they became repetitive to me. It has a few unlockable characters and pets (pasive helpers) that encourage repeating levels. It also includes an strategic extramod and coop.
Very decent game."
23356,"Ignore my extremely low play time at the time of making this review, as i've put many hours into castle crashers on console (xbox 360 to be specific). Castle Crashers is such a fun game, whether you're playing alone or with friends. There's so much to do and so many things to collect, like finding all the pet orbs, finding all the weapons, and unlocking all the characters. It felt repetitive sometimes, but never enough to get me to stop playing entirely. 

One bad thing. If this version is anything like the Xbox 360 version (which i think it might be), online multiplayer can run terribly depending on who you get matched up with.

TL;DR: Get Castle Crashers. If you're in doubt, maybe wait for a sale. I'd recommend the Can't Stop Laughing Bundle with Battleblock Theater, cause that game is amazing as well, and you can get some bonus content between the games if you own both."
23357,"One of the best games of my early childhood. As of writing this review, i'm 13 years old, and I first played this game when I was 5 years old on the Xbox 360. This is my favorite beat-em-up RPG. Please do yourself a favor and play this game."
23358,By far greatest and most hilarious scroller type game. I could spend dayss playing this game
23359,Sloth much smile during game
23360,"I went through the entire adventure with a group of randoms only to be beaten down over and over as we fought over the ladies. At least they gave me my matching color princess, we can finally live happy ever after. 

A fun game to play in coop. I however found  the singleplayer experience a bit boring simply because of the cool pvp fights for the princess after you rescue each one were missing and were only in coop. But still a few and amusing game to enjoy."
23361,Great
23362,"really awesome game but they need to add more dlcs
"
23363,"Castle Crashers was a game that I was hesitant to get at first. However, my friend really wanted me to get it so we could play together, so I bought it. It is challenging at first, but definitley not impossible. I hope your experience is as good as if not better than the one I had."
23364,Great little party game to play with your friends. Me and my friends as well as my nephews love to play this game together.
23365,I played through this whole thing with some buddies back in college. Good times. The game is solidly made and full of silly fun. I recommend it to casual and hardcore gamers alike.
23366,This is cute beat 'em up game with pets.  I have nothing bad to say.  Except about those times I died.
23367,"this game is fun, 7/10, the 3 is that it is only fun in multiplayer mode. if you have a friend play this game."
23368,This game is a fun fight guys game.
23369,One of the best couch co-ops on PC!
23370,"A fun game, though not one I would keep coming back to"
23371,"Played plenty on console years ago, bought it again for when I have time after classes and just want to enjoy a fun game. Recommend this to anyone that appreciates fun gameplay and neat artstyle The Behemoth is known for."
23372,This game is one of the best beat ups if you haven't played it yet you should especially with friends that's the best experience
23373,The game is full of content and chatacters and for itscheap price its a good game for when your bored
23374,10/10
23375,AMAZING!
23376,nostalgia
23377,"This game brings a lot of childhood for me,
It's very fun, and it's funny at the same time."
23378,get rekt!!
23379,lots of fun!!! awesome game!
23380,Wonderful would buy again if had to
23381,Great Game To Play With Friends
23382,"Absolutley amazing played it on the xbox 1  and  had so much fun, moved on to pc but no one ever plays online anymore, it makes me sad because I cant find any one thats a challenge.
"
23383,"Entertaining, humorous, and enjoyable to play! I fould it a little grindy, but with a few friends it's a lot of fun!"
23384,Really good game to play with your friends!!
23385,Fun to play CO-OP with friends.
23386,"Decent campaign, both fun and challenging, colorful and action paced. The campaign shortness can be extended through the many character unlocks, as well as the many weapons and pets to find for each one.

Controller is recommended, but it's still playable with keyboard only. You can bind the keys to fit your needs.
The major downside is the P2P party: all players will experience lag if any has a too low bandwidth."
23387,The best game to play Coop. Incredibly fun and also a lot of button mashing lol
23388,Funny and pretty enjoyable. Cute OC
23389,"This is THE most amount of fun I've ever had playing co-op.  Originally bought this on the Xbox 360, had a blast there and the PC port just delivers the fun on better graphics and higher framerates.  What's not to like?

Only thing that I still dislike the game for is the experience system, mostly due to it basically saying ""Don't put any points into strength.""  How the experience gain works is that, for every hit you make on an enemy that's alive, you get 1 experience point.  Doesn't matter if your swing does 30 damage or 90, you only get 1 experience point, so in order to get a decent amount of levels, you have to spend your points elsewhere.  Apart from that, it's still an amazing game nonetheless.

Make sure to grab a 4-pack though.  Nothing's more fun than fighting a boss to free a princess, then fighting each other to see who gets the kiss.  Protip: Focus Red Knight, especially if he's put points into his magic.  You'll thank me later c;"
23390,This is a fun and corny game.  With 4 player it's a very fun play through
23391,Entertaining game to play with friends.
23392,Do you like spamming buttons? Do you like toilet humour? Then this is the game for you!
23393,"So good game for 2 - 3 - 4 players. Interesting RPG, Awesome combat and magic. 9/10 Recommended."
23394,I remember playing this when it first came out a few years ago with my cousin back in like 2008 and now I can enjoy one of my favorite games again :D
23395,"In my opinion the best game under its chosen genres, co op, action, adventure. Really fun by yourself or with other people. 10/10"
23396,Cool game
23397,4 local players is a must. if not just dont bother.
23398,"I bought this due to the reviews, and try play this local multiplayer with my small cousin.
And yes, It was fun!!!

"
23399,"Wish I had friends to play this with. Either way great game, must play if you like hack 'n slash games."
23400,"For King and country! And glowy magic crystal!

Castle Crashers is a 2d Beat-em'-up where you play as a multitude of knights and monsters on a globe-trotting quest to rescue the glowy magic crystal thing and the four princesses. 

Story: The story is very basic. As mentioned, you have to rescue the crystal thing and save some princesses. Nothing fancy or special, but the gameplay more than makes up for it.

Gameplay: A controller is recommended, but since I don't have one, I used keyboard controls, which weren't that bad. You may want to hotkey your magic attack to 1 or q instead of e, but they're generally pretty good. You move you little knight along with typical wasd controls, jump with the spacebar, attack with r, and use magic attacks with e. You can use different moves by inputting a direction while holding the e or r keys, and some moves combo into eachother. You'll be beating the crap out of everything you come across, and it's not that difficult. You'll also collect some pets along the way with their own perks (extra gold, health, attack, etc.)

The multiplayer is where this game really shines, though. You and up to three friends can play through the campaign together (the enmies get buffs, of course). Once you reach the end of a level, you'll battle your friends to the death for the princesses' kiss and a ton of gold. Needless to say, it's a blast.

Do yourself a favor and pick up this game. You won't be dissapointed. 8.5/10"
23401,This game makes me want to tell a blind kid to look at me.
23402,Love This Game!
23403,11/10 -ign i rek dragon on lvl 22 with 0 Healing Bottles!

23408,"Awesome game, love the art. Would definitely recommend this as a fun party game.
"
23409,love it super dooper fun
23410,one of the best co-op games around
23411,Very good

23416,"Muito bom para jogar co-op

9.0/10.0"
23417,"It's ok the art style is great,  but I'm not the biggest fan of the rest. Instead I would much rather recomend battleblock theater which sports the the same great art style but is an platformer obstacle course insted of a beat em up. I don't know the game gets a 5/10"
23418,"colourfull, fun and amusing"
23419,I would recomend this to anyone who would enjoy a quick little knight beat em' up game with friends
23420,"I really love this game
and I really want castle crasher2!!!
(if the developer see this I hope they will do it)
"
23421,"Pretty solid game; good level of challenge.  The multiplayer is fun. 

Only complaint would be that it can be hard to tell if you are lined up with an enemy on the y-axis."
23422,Choose your pet wisely.
23423,10/10 WOULD JUGGLE BADDIES AGAIN xD
23424,"If you want a fun day or two for you and your friends this is the best game you can buy for you and 3 of your friends for the best time. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone, it's a fun beat em up game that gives a lot of diversity in characters to weapons to even pets that change the stats of your character, if you play this you may get sucked into the game. It also has a difficulty curve in enemies and bosses which you may have to do re-do and of course the game is made by Behemoth the so the humour is incredible, anyone can sit down and play this with your friends. You can play this by yourself but it may not be as fun with a couple mates. And if you wanna be the cool friend for a week you can buy them the 4 pack it's a fair deal. I would also reccomend BattleBlock theater an also incredible platformer with great humour :D

So in all honesty everyone on steam needs this game and share the time with your best friends and have a blast!"
23425,"Getting the achievement ""The Final Countdown"" was difficult. In the last 10 seconds I had my eyes closed, mashing the arrow keys in hopes I would make it. Felt like Andrew Neiman from Whiplash."
23426,"Such a fantastic game! Pretty much Streets of Rage fused with Battleblock Theater and oh my god is it glorious! I'm also very happy with the inclusion and execution of the multiplayer, especially considering the high quality local play which is rare in modern titles. 

Solid 5/7"
23427,Mitko sere
23428,Great game
23429,if you love playing with people this is a fun arcade game that never seem's to upset me
23430,"can someone friend me so i can play with you
btw realy love the game
"
23431,"Great beat em' up game for a good time with friends.

Top features for me are:

- Local Co-op with Controller and Keyboard
- Up to 4 players
- Variety of characters with different abilities
- Plenty of weapons and modifiers suited for preferred playstyles
- Insane mode for replayability

The references to other media franchises are fun too.

Overall - 9/10"
23432,"i love
 this game 
 im on insane mode but i cant beat it sadly"
23433,"Rainbows. Weasels. Cats. Complete random chaos. Button mashing. That's how you describe this game. It is glorious, unadulterated entropy.
And you have so many different types pets in this game(I like the owl), and when THAT'S the afterthought when someone's reviewing the game instead of a main point, you that's a pretty good indicator it's good."
23434,Amazing!
23435,"Very fun to play, great co op game!!!
JOOSH!!!"
23436,Fun beating up your sister!
23437,Game is too repetitive and I got to max level too quickly however it has a nice CO-OP
23438,"Wacky fun with friends. If you are looking for a single screen multiplayer game this is an essential, especially with so few out there."
23439,Fun co-op game
23440,Actually a really good game with comedy and a lot of replay value.
23441,"I love this game, so much better now that they have it here on steam, 100% recommend this game

"
23442,The best indie game I have ever played. Doesn't matter what age... it is still amazingly fun. Highley reccomend.
23443,One of the best games out there! But this shit immediately you fucking cunt!

This game is the best 2D arcade slasher game I have E V E R  played

Fun with Friends (Except the connection issues that can happen while in game)

Controller compatiable (Highly reccomend)

Addicting

Great story

Competetive 

everything"
23447,"The Game is Fun And Addicting, I Just love it, I Have played it on Xbox 360 For a long time, and i got hooked to it."
23448,"5/5, would recommend."
23449,"Very Fun Game, suggest to play it with Friends. Also got a nice Replay Value with the insane mode and the different Characters. Its worth the Money. Buy it!"
23450,"Fun game, really reminds of flash games back then.

Especially fun with friends."
23451,"If you're thinking about getting it, get it. I have 30+ hours and have beaten it multiple times, never gets old."
23452,Awesome!!! Great Couch Co-Op!! Get it!
23453,Hours of fun are wrapped up into this game! By yourself or with a party the fun never stops. 10/10
23454,"Castle Crashers is a game with a crap ton of grinding, spamming attacks, stupidly hilarious moments and a lot of characters and levels to go through. It's levels are fun, co-op is fun, the grinding is boring and at some point it's just hitting buttons and hoping you don't get stunned in between attacks. It's alright"
23455,Sure its good.
23456,"Good game, recommending to everyone!"
23457,Beat 'em up.
23458,back off barbarian LIT
23459,Fantastic game i love it anyone who plays it will most likely enjoy it... friends make it better....
23460,"A very good game, very creative alot of characters to unlock and pets too, funny story and funny moments too, the best game to play with your friends It's a game of four, highly recommend."
23461,"Played with keyboard and had fun anyway
It's a short experience, but a still great one.
Also, some gameplay elements felt a bit lackluster.
8/10"
23462,OYUN KARI GİBİ SİZİ BOŞALTABİLİR YANİ GÜZEL  OYUN
23463,Top notch Nostalga. . . That is all that needs to be said. Play this game!
23464,"Look, I won't lie, the game is a fun couch coop for up to 4 people. this, while being a pro also makes it a con.
with no dedicated players online the gameplay becomes a bit stale and repetitive in single player. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you're planning on buying a 4 pack.

8.5/10

"
23465,"Co-op is brilliant and so much fun.

+: coop, gameplay, story, characters, weapons, items to buy, controls, skills, just everything

- : last level, that is pain, a real pain.

must have, classic, 10/10, would crash castles again"
23466,"Xbox veteran, loved the game, saw it was on steam, picked it up immediately. This is a MUST BUY if you have friends to play with otherwise it is not nearly as fun solo but still solid and great game, one of the classics"
23467,left click and right click is a powerful move
23468,"The corn is wearing underwear.
10/10"
23469,This Game Rules
23470,i got this for coop and i can never get matched up with anyone. still a pretty solid adventure game. level design is pretty good. items are cool. controls are good just wish they were in better spots.  it makes my hand uncomfterabke cuz the buttons are in werid spots. brawlhalla has great controls. something like that would be better. also its a fighting game but has some parts were ure riding animals and one part were u swim. u do get new combos when u lvl up and thats a life savor.  u need them in big groups of enemies. overall a little dissapointed but its wild and fun. if it wasnt for its crazyness i would probably down vote this. oh and i find the animal system is pain so far. im still early the game buts so annoying. yeah they help with certain levels but that means backtracking ans finding the right one and its just no. but after all that i think its worth a try. maybe its better with coop but its ok with single player.
23471,It'll be lots & lots of fun playing this game with your friends.
23472,"Despite my playtime, I had this on XBLA when it came out.  I think I'll play this game with my children whenever that time comes.  It's surprisingly timeless and functions great as a multiplayer brawler.  There are times where it gets [b]REALLY[/b] hard and then other times where it's a breeze.  Buy this game.  It's great."
23473,"This game, I've wanted for YEARS!!! I would say the gameplay is nice, and the story is awesome. The characters make me laugh, especially Cyclops. He's one of my favorite characters so far anyway."
23474,This is the game for you if you just wanna smash people into the ground. I love how it has a leveling system yet doesn't put the focus on it. You can progress without the need to grind.
23475,good game
23476,"This is a good game. I enjoyed the adventure. Although, keep in mind that this is a button mashing. My fingers will get tired within several minutes. (I used a Xbox controller)"
23477,"This game is so fun. Much like Gauntet Legends imo. 
Any gamer should try it. Especially for RPGr's!
"
23478,"I love this game, played it with my friends.... LIES I HAVE, I HAVE NO FRIENDS!!! BWAHAHAHAHAH





This game was fun and if you have the chance to buy it, THEN BUY IT."
23479,"Fun game, but a bit too grindy for me.  
Mash attack, throw in a special attack, spam weak and heavy attacks some more.  Repeat.
Not heavy on thinking, which is why it tends to get old quick.
Has decent co-op, but again, gets old quick."
23480,"Awesome game!  What I most appreciate is the pace.  Frantic and action-packed enough that the tension is always on, yet slow enough that actual strategy and wit is needed to succeed.  This game has amazing boss fights and center-piece action sequences.  One of my favorites is when you're riding fawns through a long tunnel with an enormous monster hot on your heels.  In another you're in a river fighting a giant cat-shark while a battleship backs you up with cannon fire.  You have to ride far enough ahead to stay out of its clutches but close enough to forsee incoming obstacles.  It's that type of non-stop varied gameplay that makes this game so fresh and addictive.  I played it with my girlfriend co-op and it was a perfect fit.  On the couch or online its a blast."
23481,A very fun and goofy game that brings back old childhood memories of me and my cousins staying up all night trying to finish the game. Overall very fun gameplay and multiplayer
23482,gud
23483,I love playing this game with friends  and family!! Such a good time! I also enjoy the cartoony aesthetics that accompany the wacky story line.
23484,"Great characters/classes, great humor, great graphics, great abilities, great weapons, great bosses, great levels, great gameplay, and great everything else. This game is really fun and can keep you playing for hours with it's diverese characters and classes and insanely hard insane mode. There are so many levels to play and pets to unlock and combos to discover and secrets to uncover. It's a really great game considering it's 5+ years old. I never get bored playing this game and I still have yet more to do in this game. I tip my hat to you, Behemoth!"
23485,"Loved this game on the 360. Probably one of, if not the best, hack n' slash game out there."
23486,"Fun little game best played with friends either online or shared screen. Some very comical and chuckle moments within the game that will leave a smile on your face. Overall at good button basher which can sometimes give you a run for your money, even better on sale! Thumbs up!"
23487,Fun little game to play with ur friends :D
23488,I loved this game so much on the XBox 360 that I had to buy it on Steam.
23489,Great game. very fun and can't stop playing. 5/5
23490,"Castle Crashers combines Beat Em' Up and RPG elements with colorful and fun visuals and gameplay, creating an amazing experiance throught its duration. As an added bonus, this game includes one of the most fun co-op modes I have ever played."
23491,i really love the game but not many people play it anymore so i cant play online so its no fun ):
23492,Nesse jogo o teu objetivo principal é o destravamento de personagens e é isso não há nada mais para se fazer nele além de ficar destravando personagens o dia inteiro passando sempre pelas mesmas fases monótonas e fazendo isso repetitivamente em um círculo vicioso e tedioso.
23493,"[h1]It's a really good game![/h1]

I would strongly recommend it but it will take you a while to complete it.

It took me about 35-40 hours to finish it but if your bad like me you will delete all your stats and have to start again :(

Anyway I hope to see more from you guys in the future!"
23494,Such a fun little game!
23495,"Fun game to play with friends,it's kinda hard the first time but it's easy to adapt to it."
23496,"not only does it have a disney esque cartoonish artstyle, which, by the way, makes me almost vomit, its grossout humor falls short and the core gameplay is just not fun. definitley not worth a buy, definitley not a good game."
23497,Loved this game since childhood i played in 2010 and beat the game with my brother about 30 times and i still love to play it today Behemoth studios by far makes the best games i really recomend this game.
23498,"a very good co-op game
Gameplay - 8
story - 8
music - 7
controls - 8
graphics - 9
multiplayer - 10
price - buy with friends

8 out of 10"
23499,Fun hack n slash that is at its best with your friends.  Solo is okay but just having one friend to play it with drastically increases your enjoyment.
23500,"Very enjoyable game. One of a kind when you play it in 5 ppl. 
You can see in every scene, that developpers enjoyed themselves during developement - and so they made the experience enjoyable for you. 
Thank you for opportunity to save a few stolen princesses and to wipe out some evil (and then beat the s*** out of some of my friends)."
23501,Awesome!!!! I cant find any reasons anyone would not like this game. I LOVE IT
23502,Es gud
23503,its a good game
23504,buy me a new castle bullys
23505,hey thats pretty good
23506,crazy
23507,"Hey, this is pretty good"
23508,"A classic coop game where if you have some friends then it's at its best along with some... nice humor, but great gameplay, fun bosses, and loads of characters to unlock along with that sweet soundtrack. So get this game if you like beat em ups and have friends who have this. Then you'll be all set!"
23509,"The game itself becomes incredibly boring before you hit the level cap and before you get even half the characters through the main story. Not because it isn't entertaining, but because the level cap is 100 (you can beat the game at like level 20) and there are a lot of characters.

I do not recommend it as a single player title. Play multiplayer. It is a blast and it is well drawn/animated/allthatstuff. Simple controls for controller and keyboard. The local multiplayer works just dandy too."
23510,A Fun Indie Arcade style Beat em Up that i wish there was more gwmes on steam just like this one. I recomend it if you have four friends who want a cooperative story with some competive parts like saveing the princess first.
23511,<3
23512,"I don't normally write reviews. However, with this game it's a must. The game itself isn't very long which, is a little bit disappointing considering, the game is phenominal. The gameplay and it's mechanics are very easy to understand. While slowing increasing the difficulty. It has to it challenge but, not to the point where you want to pull your hair out. Making easy to play with gamers and people who play more casual alike. One of the best things about the game is the multiplayer aspect. It has that sort of couch co-op feel to it. (The co-op btw can be played online or local) As if you were sitting with relatives or friends on a couch, playing the game. However, the singleplayer campaign is enjoyable as well. While, being a tad bit more difficult considering you're playing by yourself and can't really revive yourself mid-battle. The single player is fun but, not as enjoyable as multiplayer. As far as the other aspects of the game go. There are plenty secrets for all you gamers to find. Like, unlocking all characters and find all the weapons/pets and insane mode.( You unlock this after you beat the game and it pretty much makes you play through the game again but all enemy stats are multiplied by 10 obviously, this is optional) Anyways, final verdict. There is pretty good amount of stuff to do in this game. The only problem is, because it's so enjoyable you always want more but there isn't, unfortunately. those are about my only problems with this game. I give it a soild 9/10"
23513,"Castle Crashers is comedic, entertaining, and even a tad bit gruesome.  I wouldn't expect anything different from The Behemoth.  The game is great to play alongside friends, as the game promotes collaboration and healthy competition.  Each major segment of Castle Crashers seems to result in a group working together, only to be torn apart by a princess's kiss.

I do truly find the game fun, but replaying the game again and again gets dull.  The only varations in the ""story process"" is the plethora of unlockable characters to play as and the pals you fight with and against.  While characters are abundant, plenty of their magical abilites are limited to arrows and bombs.  Nonetheless, the quest to unlock them all poses a formidable challenge if you're up for it.  I will admit that Arena and Insane mode unlockables are fun, difficult alternative to the traditional game completion.

Bosses aren't particularly imposing until you reach Insane Mode.  Before this, the bosses just don't feel all that powerful.  The concepts of plenty of them are imaginitive, but having to defeat them isn't really a challenge, just an inconvience.  As always with The Behemoth's games, the ending is surprising and downright hilarious."
23514,Solo (puke)
23515,Zerado. Nice Game.
23516,"is gud
"
23517,One of the best games I've evered played . The play style of the game makes it easy to play with your friends. I have only beaten only the game twice and had alot of fun doing it. The animation style make it seem like a cartoon. I will only stop playing the game if i reach level 99 on each character.
23518,good game end of.
23519,Pretty good for a couch coop.  Love the art style too.
23520,"This takes me back to the good old Newgrounds days. I'm happy to see that Tom and Dan are still very active in the business after all these years. The controls in this game are very smooth and there is a lot of awesome moves and magic spells you can learn. I can tell a lot of work went into this and can see why it's regarded as such an indie classic by this point. It still has that Newgrounds vibe and even sort of reminds me of games from back in the day such as ""Disorderly"" and ""Last Piece of Cake."""
23521,actually my favorite game
23522,This game is very fun to play whit friends.
23523,no
23524,"Amazing game, one of the best couch coops out there."
23525,"Great game to play whether alone or as a party (local or online), you get to beat all the enemies to death in a cartoon game :D Plenty of characters to play and weapons to unlock/earn and pets to find ^^ And no, insane mode is nowhere near easy..........."
23526,Great game. Great fun.
23527,Avatar the last castle bender
23528,its a great game to kill time and play wit frwiends
23529,[h1]IT'S LIT[/h1]
23530,This game is really fun to play with friends with very simple controls.
23531,Great playing either solo or with friends. I've played for years and have years worth of experience back on PS3.
23532,One question Why is it called Castle Crashers when no castles get crashed. The one question I've always pondered still an awesome game Though.
23533,"Fun, easy to play, has hidden stuff you have to find through out the game, never ending (?)."
23534,Not the best replayability but still a fun game
23535,"This game is funny yet not make me laugh, but the fighting are worth to play with your beloved pals"
23536,Nice game :)
23537,AMAZEBALLS
23538,This is a very good game I must say all tho it kinda sucks that multiplayer matchs are only you an friends but it's still a grate game!
23539,Fell in love with this game on Playstation so I couldn't resist getting it on Steam. It is just how I remembered it. Freaking awesome!
23540,My mate and I play this game in class all the time and is one of the mist funniest games in your spare time with a couple of mates.
23541,ye
23542,Great Game definitly Worth it! the story is GREEAT and even better with friends awesome game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
23543,GERMANY!!!!!!!
23544,"needs more updates, once the game's over it's there's not much gameplay..."
23545,"Fantastic game with 4 player online/local co-op, controller support, two non-story modes (Back Off Barbarian and Arena), great looking graphics and to top it all off, a whole lot of characters you can unlock. Get this as soon as you can and pick up other The Behemoth games while at it, because you're gonna play them for a long time."
23546,pretty good game to play with  ya friends and yell at them
23547,love it
23548,good
23549,"This game is very AMAZING. I emphasized amazing because I really mean it. I used to play it on my dad's xbox 360 but when I got it for my computer, I was so excited. I play this game pretty often just because it is so amazing."
23550,"it's fun.
"
23551,"It's challenging, fun, and has great replayability especially if playing with friends. It's one of those cheap games that's easy to get into from the start, isn't hard to figure out, and is very entertaining to play. I also have to give props to the DLC--Castle Crashers is a finished and complete game (Without any bugs!) that doesn't rely on DLC to prop it up. The DLC is just $2 of stuff that isn't required or game-changing; it's there for a bit more variety."

MAKE INSANE EASIER YOUR STUIPED COMMIES"
23556,"This game is the second installment of the Behemoth games and i must say its very fun! Its a game THAT YOU MUST play with friends. Its ok in solo and you are more focused on what everything that is happening, But if you play this with friends you just lose it and have such a blast. This game is a 8.5/10 i would rank it much higher but unfortunatly this game gets old after a wile."
23557,"Good Beat 'em with friends or solo.

Nice cast of characters as well."
23558,mUCH Fun very GoOd!!
23559,"Hey, that's pretty good!"
23560,"its like ah
ow
haha

and then this big f*ck-off spider bloke pops up and its like
oh no

but then its like
oh he was 10x easier than necromancer

really this whole game is leading up to necromancer fight and then the wizard fight afterwards is just a pisstake"
23561,Fun cute game. Love it
23562,I've had this game on xbox for ages. It's such a fun game. Even though it says ive had 3 hours ive had more on xbox. If you want a fun and wacky game then this is it!
23563,"it is very fun!
you can have 4 people on one PC, or 2v2 online.
i suggest you buy it for a friend
11/10
funny"
23564,pretty good game i liked it but i already beat the ps3 version but did the steam for fun its i liked it alot
23565,"Good game to beat up people, I like it"
23566,"great freaking game , i played it alot offline"
23567,I love this game
23568,i like the game becuz it's a 2d side-scrolling beat 'em up genre.
23569,"very fun brings back memories and very addictive you should play.
"
23570,Fun game! Love the animation style.
23571,Fun little beat 'em up with some RPG progression. Best when multiplayer.
23572,"Good game but i cant get anyone to play with me
"
23573,Gets rather repetitive. Suffers greatly if you do not have a group of friends to play with.
23574,good game i love it i would recommened it bc the online is super fun!!!! its a challenging game that makes you want more of the levels behemoth make more please
23575,"amazing and fun game as well, i would totaly recommend this game 14352345235423 out of 5"
23576,likeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ;P
23577,"Only two words to describe this game. Fun, magnificent, and random
"
23578,The game is very good. super fun to play with friends!
23579,i liked it
23580,I realy liked how you could play with a friend one with a controler and the other the keyboard and mouse.
23581,Another great game from The Behemoth. Lots of co-op fun to be had with friends.
23582,"This game is sincerely one of the best I've seen, which may not be saying much as I have only played about 45 games and completed 31 of them. However, it still really made an impression on me both on the Xbox (where I was playing it at the ripe age of 10) and also now on the PC remastered edition, with better graphics, smoother gameplay, and some new DLC and other cool content, like the Insane Store. Speaking of Insane Mode, it will keep you playing for a long, long time. I have made it to the Lava World so far, and MAN is this mode not kidding aroudn with its title ""Insane Mode"". It really is insane, but it's seldom unfair. I may have gotten angry at the game a few times, but my mistakes were almost always part of my own error and not the game's, which really proves to me that Castle Crashers truly is a well done game. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who either has lots of friends to paly with (The game has 4 player multiplayer functionality) or if you're looking for a game to master, as there is a ton to master here (What with button combos, techniques, and of course Insane Mode). Go play it. The $14.99 is definetly worth it.

P.S. The DLC is only $.99? You go, developers!"
23583,Great game to play with family and friends!
23584,"It's a fun, button mashing, fantasy game, where you can play with your friends (mostly competitive co-op), and has simple, but great visuals. It's worth the purchase."
23585,It is very fun multiplayer game. I can spend hours just playing this game. If I go out for a holiday I can still play this with my brother using controller.
23586,nice game lol. Too bad there isnt a sequel or anything. or will there be one?? ILUMINAUTI CONFIRMED!!11!!
23587,10/10
23588,"THIS IS A GREAT GAME
"
23589,"Castle Crashers is one of the most replayable games I have ever played. The overall quality is great, there is not a bland level, and I am constantly recommending it to my friends. The co-op is even better. Getting together with a few friends over skype, teamspeak, discord, etc. and doing a run of the game is a great deal of fun. The game features character diversity strong enough to enhance replayablility, and a well-made class system which makes the multiplayer experience even more enthralling. If you are looking for a game that provides a fun, satisfying experience to play and a great use of $15 then Castle Crashers is perfect for you and your friends.
P.S: if this game is on sale as you read this review, it should be an easy choice to pick it up."
23590,"Castle Crashers is a really good arcade - beat'em up game. Due to it's : 
-Humor
-Ennemy variety 
-The boss fights 
-Unique levels 
-Great storyline 
-Fun minigames 
-Good rpg éléments
-Good co-op experience"
23591,"This game good lord where do I start I first played this game on my cousin's XBox 360 when I was like 5 or 6 when I was 9 his XBox got broke because my other cousin is a dumbass and stepped on it. Because of that I never got to play the game again until yesterday when I got it and finally played it after 5 or so years and this game is just as amazing as I remember it being. The music is FRICKING AMAZING and even better then I remember it being. The levels, enemies, and everything is Phenomenal I just can't express in words how much I love this game I will never not like this game I promise that. Besides being a bit to difficult at times this game is amazing 

10/10"
23592,"i like the game so much and i just beat it and i am a kid wowXD
"
23593,10/10 would castle crash again
23594,"I loved playing the demo as a child while visiting relatives. was great fun, now i have full game i love it! 9/10"
23595,"A fun, care-free game that is simple hack-and-slash fun. I'd play it again easily. Definitely recommend lol"
23596,Why doesn't this game have a sequel?
23597,"Grind fest, but if you wanna dick around with your friends it's good"
23598,it gad
23599,"With friends, instead of fighting the enemies, it became a battle over who gets to control the overworld map."
23600,"AWESOME GAME
"
23601,This game is amazing!!! I bought the 4 bundle so my friends could play and they love it just as much as me!
23602,This game is a blast to play with friends like an old school couch co-op game.
23603,If Papa John ran Pizza Hut. An amazing game overall.
23604,"Castle Crashers is a game that you wanna play along with at least one friend, even better if you do it in local multiplayer! It makes for many funny and ridiculous situations. 

This game is great. It's very entertaining and challenging at times. The maps are detailed and very different, and the graphics and gameplay won't get old. Its duration is good, it's replayable and it features extra game modes. The adventure is filled with humor and it'll put a smirk on your face a handful of times.

Only cons I can note (which don't ruin the experience at all) are that sometimes it's very hard to see where your character is, because the screen gets very cluttered and messy, full of enemies, items and spells. Also it can be quite difficult to hit enemies sometimes. The hitboxes are a bit deceiving and often you will see yourself waving your weapon to the air if you don't pay attention.

Castle Crashers is an outstanding game and I recommend it to anyone who looks for a fun coop game. Especially knowing that you can get it around 2.50€ on sales."
23605,"This game was AMAZING! No lag exept for my network issue on online game. Lots of secrets, Lots of characters, Lots of fun. Defanatly would be worth the money"
23606,Extraordinariamente adictivo y muy divertido para una tarde con los amigos!
23607,"So, I love this game, but, it's missing one thing... Steam Workshop Mods, that would be AWESOME,  Anyway, thats just my opiniion on what i want added to CC, i hope the Community can do things to help other people with awesome Characters, please take this into consideration, anyway, thats my part :D enjoy Players! have a fun time Destroying enemies! This game is awesome! I just want Steam Mods :P, PLEASE ADD THEM!"
23608,"IT IS A GREAT GAME! I recieved this game as a gift but it is SO much fun to play, if you are considering getting a new game, get castle crashers! There are lots of different weapons and pets and items and magic and humour. The only bad thing about the game is that there is no save button so sometimes you can lose progress after quitting the game."
23609,Best
23610,Fantastic game fun with friends or by yourself
23611,owo whats this
23612,"This game is an absolute blast to play with friends and is sure to make some memories <3
Although the game is still fun by yourself, every extra person added makes it so much better."
23613,"How to win the game

[spoiler] Heavy Attack+Light attack to infinity [/spoiler]

And watch the bodies fly."
23614,I love this game but I wish we could use the fish person or troll as a playable character.
23615,"Play with friends, fight vs boss, one of friends dies near the end, he get 0 gold, see him rage quit, best game 9/10"
23616,Great Game
23617,This game is great for playing with friends and even matchmaking online. It's very varnish and had childish humor but that's the charm of this game.
23618,"So in love

I met a guy, he's at my school
Mega-handsome, he looks like an idol
And yet, he's awesome, a real professional in football
Each girl's heart is at stake
But I'm in love, so in love
 
I take a really deep look into his eyes and see a thousand rainbows
And I feel so yodeley-yodeley-yodelo
I want to dance, I want to jump because he makes my heart sing
And then it goes like yodeley-yodeley-yodelo
 
He's my best buddy, my friend, my shelter
Have you ever seen a more beautiful image than that of the two of us together?
 
I take a really deep look into his eyes,
And I feel so yodeley-yodeley-yodelo
 
I want to spoil him every day with notes
Saying that I'd like to kiss him la la la la
 
And when he smiles at me, I'm never getting used to it
And then I feel so
Yodeley-yodeley-yodeley-yodeley-yodeley-yodeley-yodeley-yodelo
 
I take a really deep look into his eyes and see a thousand rainbows
And I feel so yodeley-yodeley-yodelo
 
I want to dance, I want to jump because he makes my heart sing
And then it goes like yodeley-yodeley-yodelo
 
He's my best buddy, my friend, my shelter

Yodeley-yodeley-yodeley-yodeley-yodeley-yodeley-yodeley-yodelo"
23619,"you've probably heard good things already about this.
it's fun, long and pretty hard at times."
23620,Gay
23621,"Crazy game. Really fun to play with friends. I would recommend this to anybody who wants to have lots of good humor, a bit of gore and to have an awesome adventure with friends. :D"
23622,its okay.
23623,Funny and cool game
23624,"Castle Crashers is a great side scrolling beat-em-up game. Due to large amounts of enemies, it's a great game to grab a partner, family, or friend. Add this coop experience, with funny, creative characters and bosses, unique designed levels, RPG game elements, mini-games, and great a great storyline, and you have your self what is known as the all-time great local co-op game. The controls are easy to get used to and the combos are pretty simple. After every level up, you get to add points to either your Strength, Defense, Magic, or Agility categories. You have a variety of weapon choices to best fit you, whether you go with the Magic, Strength, or Agility builds. You have pets with their little perks, which you learn about each one and their purpose at the Animal Center. The humor in this game is phenomenal, you will know when those parts come up. Like who really comes up with deer pushed forward by it's own poop? And a huge bear pooping because a beast scared the poop outta him... literally. You face each other off for the hand of the lovely maiden. It's hilarious. We personally don't know how much different this game is solo, so this review is solely based on a 2 player local co-op experience. We definitely give this game a recommend cause we had a blast playing it."
23625,the rad art style and crazy bosses and story really make this game stand out from the rest. Gameplay is also fantastic.
23626,"fun game
"
23627,Game edyan.. Very good .. Recommended
23628,Would recommend.
23629,Its realy great game to play with friends
23630,this game is just really good. good job making good game.
23631,if you like co-op or multiplayer games i reccomend you try this out
23632,"If you are looking for a game to play with your friends with low end pc's or are really nostalgic about the Newgrounds days. Buy this game. Screw that, buy this game anyway. +Rep"
23633,It is a great indie game. The game is based maninly on button spaming but it is fun anywas. very recommended with friends local\online.
23634,wp
23635,HACK AND SLASH AND HACK AND SLASH AND HACK AND SLASH EVERYDAY SO AWESOME I RATE 11 OUT OF 10
23636,Amazing gameplay and the graphics blow you away very comedic aswell
23637,"Colorful and cute, with some nice music and it has co-op. That's about all the positive I can say about it, though. I've completed it twice online, and had a fairly okay time. It gets a bit grindy a little ways in, with the difficulty going through the roof at a certain point, until my friends and I had to replay certain levels and play very hit-and-run-style, instead of a natural growth/skill curve.

Also, you can unlock new characters, but each character starts at level 1, meaning you'll get your rear end handed to you unless you're some kind of gaming badass and can take on late-game enemies with a first level character. This terrible leveling/difficulty curve put me off on the game, and no shared XP for unlocked characters I've earned means even more grinding to waste my time. A better learning/leveling curve and some shared XP growth could have gotten me to like the game, but as it is, I only begrudgingly play it a bit every few years if friends pester me to do so."
23638,"Wait for a sale and buy the 4 pack and play with friends. Don't play it alone it's not that good. With friends I'd give it 7/10, alone it's like 5/10."
23639,Me buy. Me play. Me like.
23640,challanging and imaginitive 9/10
23641,Esse jogo é maneirão em.
23642,black people
23643,This game is pretty good and graphic in cartoon style .
23644,"This is a lighthearted, funny game. A fair bit of middle-schooler humor (i.e. poop jokes), but some actually funny content as well. Nice illustrations; good gameplay (but better to use a controller than a keyboard). Short game with minimal replay value but it was enjoyable while it lasted. Good multiplayer game for a few hours of fun :)"
23645,Funny and hilarious and a great game to play either alone or with friends.
23646,yes
23647,This is such a great game that hopefully one day will get a sequel
23648,"I played this game a LOT when it came out for the Xbox. I was all over this game back then. I picked it up again and ran through it with some friends, it was still pretty fun. I really like the concept of ""you and 3 friends go on an adventure fighting bosses to save princesses and then fight each other to kiss the princess."" It's a great way to make you have perfect team work that can turn on a dime to become arch enemies, a really fun game."
23649,"This games playing mechanics are simple to figure out, the story is hilarious and i'd reccomend this game to anyone 10 or over. 5 stars :)"
23650,"Still fun to this day for an almost decade old game. 

Worth any price tag."
23651,"Much better played with friends, especially offline with 4 controllers. Very fun and long campaign, with challenging and surprising bosses. :)"
23652,"The plot of Castle Crashers is that you are a badass knight and you kill everyone to makeout with princesses best plot ever,I got this game from the bundle with Battleblock Theatre and it's not half bad,it's pretty alright,the levels are fun and the combat is pretty complex with all the combos and magic abilities but I don't know it didn't really grab me maybe cuz I don't really like beat em ups I play it now and then but I don't feel the magic other people tell me it has. For people who like beat em ups it's maybe an 8/10 but for me it's a 6 or 7/10"
23653,recomended cus its funny and i loike it olot
23654,"I mean what can you say, it's Castle Crashers. If you've ever played the game on xbox you know what's in store. The PC version is just as fun, with tons of weapons and characters to unlock. Great game with great replayability. 

Highly recommend!"
23655,"Flawless game! Great music, pretty cool characters and designs."
23656,anyone want to play lvl 1 knights from beginig
23657,Lol i like it
23658,"Great follow up to 'Alien Hominid'. Taking the arcade style beat'em-up and adding some RPG elements, wrapped up in the Behemoth's signature art style.

Good range of characters to play with, allowing for different gameplay styles. Combo system is a bit finicky, but there's enough there to do some pretty epic 'rekking'

It just has a lovely 'pick up and play' feel to it. Love the fact that there is local co-op - not enough games have this option any more!! 

Looking forward to a sequel (or perhaps for 'Dad and Me' to get the full dev treatment).

NG-4-lyf!"
23659,A very fun game and even better to with friends
23660,"You can enjoy the game by playing alone and you can replay the game and still enjoy it, using a different knight or one of the other characters. As with all the multiplayer game, the real fun is when you play local co-op with your friends.
I bought it during a sale, but I think it's worth buying at full price.
I also highly recommend to buy the 4-pack and give the other three copies to your friends, just to have someone to play online: the game is quite old and it's not so easy to find other low level players.

Vote: 8/10"
23661,REALLY FUN GAME WITH FRIENDS. If you dont like grinding its super easy to just mod.
23662,Very fun and great mulitplayer game!
23663,"One of the best games that I have played with my friends. Extremely fun as a beat em up game (especially with friends) and with hilarious other interacions in the game. A problem that I have encountered with this game is the unbalaced multiplayer leveling system. If one person in multiplayer chooses to beat up all of the enemies that they can, they only they will be able to level up. The game is perfect otherwise. A great job to people working at this at Behemoth and much more games like this to come!"
23664,Its hard to find people to play with but other than that its good!
23665,is pretty gud
23666,This game is very fun and addictive i would recommend you play it! :D
23667,great game anyonr friend nr and i def play it with you
23668,"Castle Crashers is a great side scrolling beat-em-up game. Due to large amounts of enemies, it's a great game to grab a partner, family, or friend. Add this coop experience, with funny, creative characters and bosses, unique designed levels, RPG game elements, mini-games, and great a great storyline, and you have your self what is known as the all-time great local co-op game. The controls are easy to get used to and the combos are pretty simple. After every level up, you get to add points to either your Strength, Defense, Magic, or Agility categories. You have a variety of weapon choices to best fit you, whether you go with the Magic, Strength, or Agility builds. You have pets with their little perks, which you learn about each one and their purpose at the Animal Center. The humor in this game is phenomenal, you will know when those parts come up. Like who really comes up with deer pushed forward by it's own poop? And a huge bear pooping because a beast scared the poop outta him... literally. You face each other off for the hand of the lovely maiden. It's hilarious. We personally don't know how much different this game is solo, so this review is solely based on a 2 player local co-op experience. We definitely give this game a recommend cause we had a blast playing it.

23669,Loads of fun!
23670,It was fun 3 years ago but it has not aged well.
23671,DEUS VULT
23672,"That thing, it scares me, but facsinates me at the same time. I must play more.

8.5/10, since I constantly get overpowered by those little whute bear things who just want to hug the living life out of your soul."
23673,pretty dope
23674,awesome game
23675,"This game is all about saving princesses, but the cool thing about this game is you can find hidden weapons and pets around the whole map. I love the blacksmith DLC because his special moves are AWESOME! I believe that people should get the game because I think it's a 10/10 and a %100 percent out of %100 PERCENT!?!?!?!?!"
23676,"This is one of the best games I ve played in a while .
This game prooved that 2d games haven t died 

"
23677,best game to play with friends
23678,The game is really good....i don't have any friends tho....so i had to play it all alone.....
23679,"Very fun game and time killer, especially with friends!"
23680,"Fun, Epic, Wery Crusady. gret to play with friends."
23681,"The best of new and old school! =)
Wish there were more local multiplayer games like this one, reminds me of old times playing TMNT =)"
23682,"A must have

10/10

1 achivement is near impossible but thats about all I have to complain about.

Plays the best with friends and xbox controller but keybord works just fine."
23683,"Quality game, only really good when you're with freinds"
23684,"This game is well worth it, it is very enjoyable, funny and a great way to kill time with many different unlockable weapons and characters, you are in for a good time."
23685,"Always assumes your using a controller.

Besides that pretty fun and humorous."
23686,"Pros:
- Cool art style
- Doesn't try to shoehorn in a story; it's good with the minimal story it has
- Satisfying to win a level
- Awesome multiplayer
- Unique characters/ monsters
- Adorable followers

Cons:
- Chaotic, can be overwhelming
- Messes with depth perception
- Only fun in multplayer

Also, it's easy to be underleveled. I can't say it's really a good or bad thing because while it can be frustrating, you get to keep your experience when you die so you're never really forced to farm for xp and it makes the victories that much more satisfying. I just felt it was worth mentioning."
23687,"theres a bug  the game keeps glitching everytime
"
23688,"Castle Crashers was a fun game and is really fun with friends. the games soundtrack was extremely good, they got tons of top newgrounds creators like Waterflame to create the soundtrack.  and the gameplay although being repetitive and getting boring after a while still is fun for the first few runs. the game is no 10/10 but is still really fun"
23689,"Addicted for some reasons:
-The game helps you release a large amount of stress by rekting minions and killing bosses 
-You can find secret items and add them to your collection. 
-Complete the game in insane mode after you've completed the main story. 
-And many more things to do with friends :D. 
They've also added a mini game and several more features so you'll rarely get bored with the main game story."
23690,"-went green guy
-invests all points in agility and defence, never uses magic
-hours of fun later
-wants to do better
-watches video for good stat build
-says green guy is best in magic

oh"
23691,Would've been better if I had friends and a game controller. 10/10
23692,This game is good fun. A great Behemoth classic.
23693,An amazing game. Wierd things happen.
23694,"Nice Game if you have 3 friends to play with you. Very entertaining.
The game just need a longer campaign or more difficulties, weapons, characters, pets. But its just fine, a good game at all.
I personally recommend it."
23695,"Excellent game, lots of fun filled adventure with plenty of comedy. Play alone or with other players in your quest to rescue the kidnapped Princesses and save the kingdom while picking up some very strange pets and weapons along the way. Definitely worth a repeat playing. The battle domes are great and insane mode is just as described."
23696,"ITS AWSEOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

23697,"[h1]When all's said and done, it's every knight for himself![/h1]

Recently my weekly game night with buddies was occupied by the cartoony craziness that is [u]Castle Crashers[/u]. It's a solid, fully featured indie side scroll cooperative hack 'n slash, beat 'em up arcade brawler. I think that covers all the genre bases, but what I liked most here was the nostalgia over those great web games from Tom Fulp and Newgrounds!

This is by [i]The Behemoth[/i], who also created [u]BattleBlock Theater[/u]. I haven't had the pleasure of playing that yet. Like the best of those little Newgrounds flash games, [u]Castle Crashers[/u] has fantastic creative vision in both art and design. I wouldn't be surprised if the art were the strongest selling point for most folks. Animations, effects, enemies, environment, the whole package looks awesome.

Gameplay is nothing earth shatteringly new but it is good fun. The main campaign mode is the best part; the arena mode and little mini games are fine, but didn't hold my interest long. There's a decent variety of playable characters, each with differing special properties and magic attacks.

I didn't dig too deep into combat mechanics, but it's neat to use new combos, learn enemy tactics and weaknesses. You can brainlessly button mash through basic enemies. However, Insane mode is another matter entirely, presenting all the challenge a hardcore player could want from this type of game.

Some replayability is present if you care about unlocking all characters and exploring the more interesting weapons, properties & magic. Let's not forget the pets you find and unlock; these critters provide buffs or attacks of some sort. Newly acquired weapons might hit harder, swing faster, reach farther or add an effect. Special items like the shovel offer utility (e.g. digging for treasure).

 I love what happens in a cooperative match after you save a princess following a boss fight. Such a great idea to punctuate normal play with those funny moments. I like also how you have to individually loot health and gold. It keeps everyone on their toes and a bit competitive.

I didn't mess with any DLCs, most of which appear to be new characters.

I did use the Steam Controller to play this. It is strongly recommended to use a controller for this game. The improvement in my performance over mouse and keyboard was surprising, and it just feels way more natural.

Thumbs up! Recommended to anyone looking for their next casual co-op with a group of friends."
23698,"Recommended if you got Friends to play with. 
But be careful, it can get boring really quickly"
23699,"The best hack and slash game in my opinion, with an awesome soundtrack, fun animation and levels that have great designs. Though a great game, be warned new comers as the game can get a bit difficult at times, but I think thats another great attribute to the game. What makes this game even better is that there is multiplayer, so you and a couple of friends can play through the campaign together and experience an amazing game with others :)"
23700,Gk
23701,"WHY CAN'T I CHANGE MY CONTROLS OF MY GAMECUBE CONTROLLER, WHY! IT MAKES THIS GREAT GAME HARD TO PLAY AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN XBOX CONTROLLER GOOD LUCK TRYING TO HAVE FUN, BYE BYE!"
23702,this game beast get it
23703,Amazing.
23704,"Easily one of the best games to play with friends! Great gameplay, incredible music, and a slight competitive feeling to it that makes this a fun time for all!"
23705,"Castle Crashers is a lot of fun, beautiful graphics and has AMAZING music. I spend hours playing with my friends. I highly recommend using a controller for the full effect. 

Pros: 

Classic beat-em-up fun
Amazing music (One of the best I've heard in a LONG time)
Choice or keyboard or controller (I also listed this as a possible Con)
Single player or Multi-Player options (bring your friends for the best experience) 
Very funny moments in game
Creative enemies and bosses


Cons:

Grinding for levels can be monotonous and time consuming consuming in higher levels
Finding someone in Multi-Player lonby can take a long time or they join and leave imidiatly
You can use your keyboard, but controllers work the best for this game (Listed as a possible Pro)

Over all, I highly recommend buying this game.
"
23706,"Awesome game, there are fun gamemodes. Co-op makes it more intresting."
23707,v fun to play with friends when bored 10/10 cheap game
23708,A classic retelling of William Shakespeare's Braveheart.
23709,A very fun game!
23710,"Really fun, hilarious 2D game. I have beaten it a bunch with the different knights and they are all really fun."
23711,"Played on the console for years and switched over to pc, great game to just play and chill out with some friends or alone."
23712,"You have 5 sisters, they are princesses and they get kidnapped by tiny mans. Go save em, once you do save em, they kiss you, Much Incest. But much Fun ;)!"
23713,"This game is SO worth it, if only for the fact that you get to see (and hear!!) animals $hit themselves in fear.

Had a bad day?  Play this game.  With friends.  And prepare to laugh your butt off.

10/10 would ride a fish again."

23723,Over all a great goofy game. Lots of fun to play with friends.
23724,"Great for Couch Co-op, but you aren't seriously thinking of that, are you?

No! You have no close friends! That's a ridiculous claim! Pfft, ""Couch Co-op"", who even has a living room these days?

If you want to play it online with your friends, be prepared for a lot of trouble and connectivity issues.

Other than that, it's a solid experience with entertainment aplenty! Slash and hack away!"
23725,"Castle Crashers® is an incredibly fun game, no doubt. Although it can slowly get boring and repetitive in singleplayer, the moment you have friends play this with you it becomes pandemonium.
Yes, I recommend it."
23726,"It's fun, but its better playing with friends. On your first run, it's better to learn the game with your friends as you get to experience all the craziness that happens throughout the game. However, after your first playthrough, it will start to get repetitive trying to unlock EVERYTHING. But if you're a completionist, then go for it, great game for a good price too."
23727,Awesome game. Really good experience to play espescially with up to 4 friends. It may not be the longest game to play but I would say it is worth the money. :)  Hopefully you like it too!
23728,"The style of the game is amazing and it has some amazing things in it, from comedy to epic boss fights, to even some references! I found a few problems like my friend and I played to that slim cave level and it started glitching and we saw 2 different perspectives which was weird, I don't know whats up with multiplayer but something isnt right, besides that, the boss battles are amazing, the art style is fantastic, and I hope to see more games like this,"
23729,its just a grea fun game
23730,It's a great game and it's fun to play
23731,10/10 would buy a sequel
23732,"This game is a damn good game to play with your friends. (Otherwise, its hard as shit)"
23733,Sooooo gooood
23734,"A classic hack & slash game that has left a significant mark on the indie games industry with witty writing, funny story, simple but clever mechanics, an acceptable amount of content, and a high replayability factor with different characters, pets, weapons and game types.

23735,nice volleybal

23737,"It's fun and I want more.
That's it."
23738,"In all honesty, it's a fun game! Well made. 10/10 would play again- Not IGN"
23739,"Very good game. Its suprisingly funny despite almost no characters actually speaking. Nice action and style of gameplay.
my issues are: 1. It's haaarrrrrd. 2. Leveling up can take forever after a while. 3. Some achievments require multiple players meaning you have to find people willing to cooperate or friends that have the game. Other than that though, its great."
23740," 10/10!
Absolutely Amazing!!"
23741,"For a beat 'em up, the combat system is incredibly simplistic and gets boring very, very quickly. It's kinda fun with friends, but that's not saying much. Pretty much any game is fun with friends.

Maybe get it on a sale if you have friends to play it with. Otherwise, avoid."
23742,"This is a fantasitic party game. Hook up 4 controllers and prepare to rumble because this glorious chaotic game will give you the nostalgia of Golden Axe and Streets of rage in a semi-cute semi-creepy wonderful mish-mash style. The game plays great, but really should be played with friends. The controls are smooth when you use a controller. The game is fair while remaining somewhat challenging if you don't go back and train. The story was a real blast, but I would have liked it to be a bit longer. The music is fitting and well done. And overall the game was tons of fun and I hope to grab some friends together again somtime and  have them play through it with me. 8/10"
23743,"The only reason I'm giving this game a positive review is because of how much entertainment I've gotten from it while playing with my friends. This game would be beyond boring if you were to play alone, so much so that I certainly wouldn't recommend buying the game for the full price, and would still think twice about buying it on sale. This is a game where playing with friends is pretty much a requirement. 

Animations are nice. Story is kinda funny I guess. Combos are enjoyable to learn. Handful of different heroes with different magic skills. Much more difficult game mode.

Though, the game is way too boring and repetitive and has barely any replayability, story lines are the same with every character, a few bugs here and there - none that are game changing though, the insane gamemode is very difficult and boring to playing alone; and doesn't really have any incentive to complete the game. Online matchmaking is dead for the most part so you should consider joining the Behemoth discord to play with people if you don't have anyone to play with - though different regions will cause lag, and the experience simply isn't the same unless you make good online friends.

Overall, this game is just a time-killer and a one time experience. Even playing with friends after a certain point is still boring, though you should still offer a chance if you're interested in similar games."
23744,"its cool and fun
"
23745,pretty freakin epic
23746,i don't think behemoth has released a bad game yet.
23747,"only buy this game if u have friends to play with!
 
The solo campaign is great and lots of fun but its more fun with friends

23748,Nice game
23749,who doesnt waana be a cute lil knight with their buddys n fight over princesses
23750,This game is fun game to play with when you are around your bros.

funny in a quarky, wierd sort of way.
Has awesome humor, and will make you laugh.
Definitely recommend. 

Buy this game already.

You won't regret it."

23753,"Best game
"
23754,I LOVE IT
23755,"Nice but it gets a little bit boring when you have them all i have all character + battleblock + dlc.

you still can make it go from the start so this game is a purchase for sure"
23756,10 out of 10 bears
23757,"I really didn't want to give this game a negative review because in most cases, they're never viewed as reasonable no matter how reasonable you attempt to be.  Edit: And of course, no one actually gives a flying fuck about actual technical shit.  

So here's a heads up: There ARE technical issues to the game that play a role in this review outside of subjective preferences.  

Here we go.

First off, the technical issues keep me from enjoying this game whatsoever.   I've been looking for a new co-op game with a friend for the longest time and it seemed like Castle Crashers, a seemingly esteemed title, would be a flawless experience to try.  Unfortunately, multiplayer online gameplay has serious input lag for whatever reason.  There are *massive* stutters that occur whenever someone does something.  They may be only 50-200 milliseconds long, but it's significant enough that it absolutely ruins the feel of the game.  

While I wasn't expecting to encounter any technical hiccups for a game so well received, I'm also not the type of person to not seek for a solution.  Suggestions that I've found were stated to render the game at a lower resolution.  We knocked it down to the smallest resolution the game supported and the game was still stuttering.  Less so than before, but still to an unacceptable degree to play the game.  On top of the fact that the resolution was now 640X480.  I couldn't even read the controls.

There were literally no other suggestions other than dealing with in game settings.  I can online imagine this is because of the engine itself and not the game.  

That, is the primary reason I cannot recommend this game.  The online support for it is just too shoddy and unstable for me to even recommend.  IF someone has another attempted solution (it is NOT the result of a bad connection), I would be glad to hear it.  However, my patience has really been tested because now I move onto the subjective part of the review.

The controls and combat don't feel satisfying and instead are exercises of frustration and cramping in my thumbs, and there's an even bigger problem.  Maybe it's the stutter.  Maybe it's the lag.  But the characters have too little width of the attack on the X axis of the game.  You literally have to line up your paper thin characters to the paper thin enemies.  The worst part?  You have 0 mobility when attacking on the ground.  Meaning you cannot correct for the utter lack of horizontal range (up and down, which is the ""side to side"" of your character.  Again, the X axis of the game).  This is mitigated by jump attacks but you still suffer from the ""thinness"" problem.

It's simply unfun to me and feels unsatisfying to play.  I could barely make it through an hour or two before my thumbs started to cramp from thumbing the Xbox controller.  

That's not to say the other parts of the game aren't good.  The humor is there, the artwork is there, and I'm sure it's stupid fun with more people.  But the controls just suck for me.  And the technical issues with multiplayer make it even worse.  I cannot recommend this, and I'm actually pretty disappointed and sad to do so.  

The technical problems may vary from person to person, configuration to configuration (and it should be said, my computer far surpasses the technical requirements), but the buyer should be at least weary of these issues.

Maybe the other reviews are nostalgia tinted, maybe they didn't have the technical issues I had.  But I don't like the gameplay, and the technical problems don't make it any better."
23758,"this is a very fun game even more fun with friends, a lot of levels with great bosses(great meaning not to hard not to easy) and a great array of weapons and pet.  It takes a while to accomplish a defeat of the game which is good because it is fun and their are not many games out there that are fun and take a long time to complete.  It has a great multiplayer and single player i would recommend this game to anyone.   BOOM"
23759,Just play it
23760,Fun to play! Can get a bit monotonous after a while though.
23761,"I love this game and you absolutely need friends to play this with or you will get board. Controlars are very important so make sure you have one.

Great game in all

23770,"     Got time? Got a little money? Got friends? Get Castle Crashers. This game is AMAZING for friends who want to come together to have a little fun with one another in a pinch. You'll most likely loose track of the time if you play this with friends, as I played for two hours (apparently) and it felt like ten minutes. I am currently playing through with my friends at the time I'm writing this, we just started and we're having a blast already! I definitely recommend this game to anyone who is willing to take on this amazing journey. Not much bad I can say about the game, as everything in it seems perfect to me."
23771,fun game
23772,"Archers. You will understand, what i mean and why this is negative review, once you enter forest.

Omg, i can't answer comments to my own review without steam guard. Awesome. I'll add my answer to review then:

Games are unlike wine - bad design choices do not become better with time passing. Repeated knockdown is one of the most frustrating things one might encounter."
23773,"Hey, that's pretty good"
23774,Multiplayer empty. Is more like a friend invite only game than a online coop.
23775,"This game. Where do I even start? This pack of pixels was my childhood. I would play this everyday on my comp and I would never get bored of it. The game has a hilarious sense of humor that scales from feces to jumping penguins. Collect pets, grinding for money and EXP, it has got all of it. You go through various levels of different themes starting from a forest and ending up in a giant floating fortress. What more is there to say? I'm waisting my life typing this review and you should waste your life playing the game."
23776,"SO GOOD 10/10, recomend to play with a friend"
23777,"I rate games on a 1-5 scale ala X-PLAY (no decimals)

It's an okay beat em up. I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more if I would have played it when it came out and more people played it via multiplayer. But because I did not I wasn't able to indulge much in that. The game itself has it's moments of cleverness but there are some unnecessary difficulties with the game. Specifically the way the game handles lives and checkpoints forcing you to play the game in a very boring fashion (which for a beat em up is not fun) or ensuring you grind levels to then advance on more difficult stages. I only encountered this problem once or twice but when frustration has less to do with your ability and more to do with the game being unforgiving it's tough for me to look at it positively. Especially when most parts are so simple, so you don't expect random gross increases in difficulty.

The big saving grace is the artwork, humor, design, music and enemies. It's worth playing at least once.


3/5"
23778,"Awesome to  play, it acts just the same as if you played the game on the xbox. So you dont need a controller to play this game. Everything in the game shouts fun. So  I have nothing to say except to buy this game. Also yes, multiplayer is enjoyable as well."
23779,This is actually good.
23780,Probably one of the most fun games I've ever played. I especially love the music. Waterflame is LIT.

23785,"This game has many pros and cons so I don't know whether to reccomend or not. If you have a friend with you in the exact same room it's easy and fun to play. Now if you have online friends you wanna play with, dear God the game gets laggy. It's nice that there aren't as many dlcs as the xbox, but you just can't have fun with this version cuz the game is unplayable with online friends. My opinion: Meh"
23786,best game to have crazy fun with your friends
23787,"it might look like i have only 100 hours in this game, but thats not counting the 200 hours i spent playing on my older brothers account. i spent 300 hours in this game. a game from 2008. a 12 year old game. this is insanity, this game is so chaotic fun

23789,pls dlc key pls
23790,"How about calling it GAME CRASHERS? Cause that is all this does. Look in the forum and you will find years worth of people experiencing crashes galore of all kinds. I suppose WIndows 10 is to blame for the latest round, but since the crashes have gone on for a very long time we could easily blame the devs. In any case I played this on the ps3 a LONG time ago and remembering liking playing it with my friends. But this version obviously is not worth getting."

23797,This is probably one of the best games you can get on steam either single or multiplayer you will have a blast with the cartoonish characters and hard yet fun as hell gameplay:)
23798,"Very fun game,teamwork and duels.
You can make fun of your friends if they lose to you and get the love of the  princess."
23799,Very good game
23800,was  a pretty funny game
23801,I'm late
23802,"A brilliant game to be played with your friends.The story of the game was simple but playing online with friends in arena will be a lot of fun.Keyboard and controller are all good with it so you don’t have to worry.Only one thing: It might be boring when playing alone.Because the basic task of the game is to kill enemies and up your level,get better weapon.But if you have friends and want to have fun with them on a game.Castle crasher is the best."
23803,"crash castles with friends
p boring when alone"
23804,"Heaps of fun! Especially if you're playing this game with your friends, a lot of diverse and unique ways to play this game, as you can choose from a range of characters to play with! Although, the DLC's should've been standard additions to the game.

I'd recommend this game to anyone as this is tons of fun to play, it's the type of game to play over and over. Even though I've only played 18.5 hours, totally worth the time spent! Great job, The Behemoth"
23805,This A Very Good RPG Game that i found and im starting think that this is a good and hillarious game!
23806,Extremely fun game to play. Even more fun to play with friends.  Smash and bash all different kinds of enemies with tons of different and crazy weapons of your choice. Grab an animal orb friend to help you along your journey to save the princesses !
23807,"Good game,I can not stop playing this game XD
-Nice Graphic 
-Cheap Size
-Awesome Combat,Adventure,Co-op,Fighting,Combos 
-Nice Co-OP"
23808,"What can i say ? 
-It a game look like i've been played on Play Ground...
-Many Characters to unlocked on ur way..
-Hack'N Slash,slay the princess
-[Spoiler] U don't really want to save the last princess...It a joke.."
23809,"A must, as is with every Behemoth game."
23810,Great game overall and fun to play with friends. Expert mode really requires expertise in the game. 8/10. Would be nice if there could be 2v2 fights against other players
23811,"Bit too luck-based, repetitive and button bashy for me. The controls also feel a bit clunky and the brief pause in movement when you land from a jump is beyond frustrating."
23812,This game is AWESOME!Its like porn.
23813,It's a pretty cool game in my opinion.
23814,good game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
23815,"If you see this in a pack, buy it. Great for playing with friends online or coop."
23816,A very funny and enjoyable game. The funniest moments is when you have to fight against your own friends that helped across the level ( if you're playing the multiplayer campaign ) to see who is gonna kiss the princess at the end.
23817,Good whit freinds
23818,love it love it love it
23819,Crash castles
23820,buy with battleblocktheater and get hatty and pet whale. buy!!!!!
23821,Great game to play with your friends
23822,Bring me back to childhood
23823,hit shit
23824,gut gut
23825,wait what game is this
23826,"I enjoy it, its fun with a whole team of friends"
23827,grab 4 friends and crack open some cold ones with them and you're in for a blast
23828,Tons of fun! Fun with friends!
23829,Fun but wouldn't pay full price for it. It's 80% off right now so if you want to buy it go for it. It's a really great game.
23830,Very nice game :)
23831,This Game made my day from the crude humor of the game and the non-stop fun I felt this game was great and made me laugh when seeing this masterpiece. I reccomend it to people with a funny attitude and people who enjoy violence from little cartoon chracters.
23832,"This game is extremely enjoyable, though best played with a controller. The variety of playstyles, many levels, adorable mounts, and hilariously cartoony graphics ensure a terrific playing experience, best played with friends."
23833,"It's a fun game to play with friends, if u have one. . . ."
23834,"Doodle figures fucking up everything. Thats enough, we dosent need any more things."
23835,Isa good
23836,THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER IT IS A NEED BUY
23837,So helpful.
23838,its okay
23839,best game on steam
23840,A silly little amusing game. <3
23841,9.9/10 regret winning a friends fight at the end.
23842,Really only fun if you have friends to play with. Otherwise it starts to feel a bit tiresome.
23843,"Super fun game and addicting to play by yourself and with others. Even though there's a bit of lag in multiplayer, it's overall an enjoyable game."
23844,"So, i've been having a lot of fun with castle crashers as of late, the style of the game really draws me in. I find the goofy style to be appealing, as it is also based on solid gameplay with some interesting enemy and map variety.
Overall, if you're just looking for some cheap goofy fun, this is a great game for you to try, although it can be repetitive at times, it gets even better with friends. Overall i do recomend this game."
23845,"Great game. this is my fourth playthrough of it as of 7/3/2017 and I've gotta say even though enemy power and arrow spam can be a bitch it's still pretty fun and the story is super cute.

You really can't go wrong with castle crashers. it's such a good silly game and I hope someday Behemoth revisits the series and creates a spinoff or a second game.

(For those wondering why my time is so low. 4.3 hours on steam. it's because I had it on the 360 and then the xbox one.)"
23846,"Lol My friend called me cuz he needed help killing a dude

ima go back to Batteblock now

seeya"
23847,This is one of the best games for multiplayer mayhem 10/10.
23848,"I like it alot
"
23849,"This game is awesome! U can spend so much time with friends. I completed this game about 4 times but I still like to play it.
Mostly when u finish the game with character u unlock new character so its very good game. 

For me this game is: 11/10        One of the best games I have ever played!"
23850,"I have spent 38 hours on this game, I originally bought it thinking it would be a fun game to play with friends over the summer and bought it together with Battle Block Theater. 100% worth it, get the 4-pack and share it with friends and once you're done with the game there is still insane mode you guys can complete together. 10/10 wasted so much of my time during the summer."
23851,"One of my favorite games of all time, would totally reccomend this game to play with a friends. The graphics, story, and grind to get every character, weapon and pet is reminiscent of my childhood. Very great game and worth the buy."
23852,"Amazing game, Well worth the Mulla and if you've got mates it even better."
23853,"so so, nothing outstanding compared to the 4 player beat em ups of old.  the game has a flying attack that can be spammed.  enemy numbers are slim, and often players will be hogging what's there.  the leveling up feature also encourages competitive play (this is a good or bad thing depending on the player's taste).  the controls are a bitoverly complex for a simple beat em up.  crude humor abounds.  1.5/4"
23854,"One of my favorites games ever, I really like it."
23855,"Very fun and intense brawler. Fun and quality local coop, which is very rare. 11/10 would definitely rate again."
23856,good game
23857,"Really fun and good to play with friends

"
23858,One of the best indie games out there (only beaten by the likes of binding of isaac). A truly fun game that will have you crying tears of joy and tears of grief. this touched me on a level i cant describe and i will never forget this experience. lol its good 10/10
23859,One of the best couch co op game you will ever play!

23864,Was alright...

23866,I like i and hope you will too
23867,"i think this is the best game i have ever played but it is so hard to play omline and i have no freainds to play with (i do have freainds but they don't have this master pices)
"
23868,p good 9/11

23885,Great Golden Axe remake!
23886,The couch co-op makes it a lot of fun to play w friends
23887,"It's fun, and a good reason to yell at your friends."
23888,hi
23889,juegas conmigo
23890,"This game may be the greatest side scrolling beat-em-up ive ever played, from someone who grew up on the old double dragon and spiderman + venom cabinets thats sating something. this game is a masterpiece of its genre. the silly characters, the dumb scenarios you and your friends get up to and the endless ammount of fun to be had in duels with your favorite knight.  
pros: 
fun gameplay with characters that make everything worth while.
bosses that require a bit of thinking outside the box to beat easily.
Hatty Hatington from battleblock made an appearence as a playable knight if one has beat it.
a vast aresenal of weapons ranging from practical to downright obsurd (can anyone argue a sausage as a weapon?)
cons:
all the bugs that used to make the game fun have been patched. (we will miss you cyclops out of bounds!)
the old minigames that used to be playable are no longer here. (Rip Multiplayer Volleyball)
many of the unlockable knights are ""normal types"" meaning arrow rain attack and either a knife or bombs. (even hatty was a grey clone)
insane mode can be a trial and a half without anyone else to help.
the screen for deleting knight saves has poorly writen controls (wiping one knight or all is 2 different buttons, both icons say damn near the same thing)

Tldr: Greatest game ever, you can not go wrong with this classic behemoth title, especially if you have a crew to play with"
23891,I liked it
23892,game is fun
23893,"Great game, fun to play with friends!"
23894,"I've bought this game on every device I can buy it on, 3 different times on xbox.
The art style is adorable and the gameplay is solid and fun.
Fun solo and hysterical with friends."
23895,"This is probably one of the best games i have ever played, although short story, there is a lot of things to do to complete the game 100%. I. Love. Castle. Crashers."
23896,Really fun game alone or with friends.
23897,"Great game , especially in coop"
23898,"Great game, super reccomend :D"
23899,"There is nothing bad to say about this game. It's one of those games (like most of Behemoth's games) where you sit down with your friends and laugh/have fun until you have to go. If you have the choice, get it for you and your friends!"
23900,"One of the best games on the 360. A ton of replayability with an insane mode difficulty, different characters and builds to choose from, and general fun to be had. Even better with friends."
23901,"Another Funny Multiplayer Coop games after Battleblock Theater. 
Karakternya lucu dan gameplay sederhana dan enteng.
wkwkwk land.
sangat direkomendasikan bermain bareng teman"
23902,10/10 dankness
23903,is nice

23906,Pretty Good game for memory!

23908,very fun
23909,great
23910,its fun i guess
23911,"This game is fun. Especially with the right kind of people. It's single player experience however; it isn't too fun, but can be enjoyed. I would recommend this game if you have friends who are also interested, or if you like beat 'em ups. Give it a solid 8/10"
23912,"This game is amazing in everyway. I have played it through the whole game on xbox and beat it 100%, Now my journey continues to beat it again.

What this game offers is 

-Fighting 
-Comedy

-MAGIC
-Pets
-A blacksmith in a frog
-Storyline
-LOADS of CHARACTERS to play as

I rate this game 10/10 no doubt 

Welp time to go play BattleBlock Theater!!!!!           
"
23913,"I really encourage you to buy it, it's worth every cent.
It's a really awesome game, super fun to play with friends.
It never gets boring. Once I finished it with some friends, all in the same day, we were so tired, but we had such a great time."
23914,my favorite game of all time!!!
23915,a awesome game recommed with friend played on xbox now on steam best game ever recommed a controller not keybord
23916,Fun game to play hands down.
23917,My girl is due in a few weeks and I'm gonna name her Castle Crashers®
23918,Beat up people with your friends!!
23919,"I played this game on X-box 360 and I have to say, it was fun as hell. And to finally buy it for pc makes it 1000 times better!!"
23920,"I have played through this game alone and with friends multiple times, and I can say it is well worth the price.

A bit of plot:

You are a knight, serving your king at his command. One day while having an epic rave, a magical robe dude comes and steals the King's magical crystal. Oh no!
The King sends you off to stop the robed villian and defend the kingdom against the incoming Barbarian invasion!
As you push the Barbarian forces back, you notice that 4 Princesses are being kidnapped!  Oh nooooo!
Naturally you set off to save them with your fellow knights. 
We saved one of them! Good job everyone! 

Wait! An important question arises!
Who will recieve the privilege to make out with her?!
FIGHT TO THE DEATH WITH YOUR FRIENDS TO DECIDE!

And that's all you get to know, if you want more awesomeness, you're gonna have to buy it and play it yourself!"
23921,the mechanics are very interesting and the art style is amazing
23922,Stupidly Awsome
23923,"Even though I did not invest a great deal of time into the game just yet, I do plan to play it a lot more both co-op and solo. THe machanics are spimple but the way it is applied is loads of fun."
23924,"this a awesome game that i picked up during the steam summer sale 2017. 
In my opinion its worth the money for 2,39"
23925,yes
23926,"A great co-op beat em up with plenty of replayability.  The hunt for collectables isn't excessively challenging, but I'm still looking for a few animal orbs after playing intermitently for about three years.  Worth the buy, especially if you can get it during a sale."
23927,It reminds me of the old arcade Golden Axe but with humor added. I am really pleased with this game and my 8 yr old some is really into it. It is fun to local co-op!
23928,I IS OF GAY
23929,A very fun game. Unique artstyle and gameplay and gives a combat yet cartoonish feel like TF2. It's pretty good for bonding with friends and a really great game to buy during sales thanks to its cheap price.
23930,ITS TOO DANK PLEASE HALP 420/69 WOULD PLAY AGAIN
23931,aw yeah. hella fun
23932,4 player chaos
23933,fuck you. buy it
23934,"Very fun little game. But play with a friend to get maximum amount of fun out of this one. Some bosses can get frustrating, especially if one of your teammates die early."
23935,"Don't know why but this game makes me addicted too much to play. This is the best 2D arcade game I've played so far. Very nice graphic and gameplay. Would be good if you're playing with your friends.

10/10"
23936,I like it.
23937,Hands down one of my all time favorite games.
23938,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/83OT_OE_3hY/maxresdefault.jpg
Good Game."
23939,god i fucking hate necromancers
23940,Castle Crashers is an enjoyable beat em up.  It is much better if you play with a group of friends.
23941,nice game
23942,IT IS SO GOOD + 2$ HOLLY COW
23943,GArbage
23944,Great gameplay.  Finding it highly enjoyable.  Hope the put out more like this.
23945,.
23946,"This game is a masterpiece of a game.  The art style is amazing, and i love the pets,bosses,playable characters,easter eggs, and enemies in this game.  They all look amazing throughout the game.  Other than graphics, this games storyline is fun, some of the consumables are awesome to use, and i think the only downside is that trying to kill certain enemies get boring and tired.  On a certain level, there are nights that take atleast 3 minutes to take one.  This level is called ""full moon.""  

I would highly reccomend this game to any person that is looking into this game

8/10

-SaltShaker Reviews"
23947,"If you need a game to play with four people that takes up very little hard drive space then this is the game for you.

Otherwise it's far too simplistic and gets jarring very quickly. In a group you can convince yourself it's fun, otherwise it's not worthwhile. Worth £1/£2 in a sale."
23948,god
23949,Finally got this original one ! Good 2D Graphics and playable with 4 players. Go Indie Game Developer !
23950,"I recommend you use a Controller as stated each time before you play the game. Using the keyboard can feel weird in this type of games. Xbox 360, xbox one, steam works as well. But by far this game has been fun. Used to have it on Xbox 360 and bought it on here during the #SteamSummerSale to refeal the memorys. Me and my friends are always having fun. This is definetly a living room game each person racing to be the highest level and upgrading stats as you pass through levels. As you play this game you will find yourself laughing! Its truely a fun experience and you don't want to miss out ont his one!"
23951,The one game where you can spam without getting criticized for it.
23952,"It's super fun and engaging, and it has strategic elements as well.
Also, it can be extremely funny.
20/10"
23953,its a fun game but it keeps chrashing at random
23954,Mad nice game to play especially with friends! Very entertaining and a lot of content!
23955,"Bought this to play with my kid and have to say, was worth every penny, loads of re-playablility, great little chararcters, old skool gaming at its best, job well done!"
23956,Really good game
23957,"The art style of this game is an amazing aspect. I love it and it's a really funny game
"
23958,"I've beaten the game multiple times on Xbox with no issues. However, the multiplayer on Steam lags so much it's near unplayable. My PC can handle the game on Ultra on Single Player with no lag at all, so I'm assuming the Multiplayer servers are just terrible. If you're playing locally, this game is amazing. but if you're playing online, the game is horrible."
23959,Lit af 10/10 Everyone buy rn
23960,"This is one of, if not, my favourite beat-em up game.
it has:

-great gameplay

-good fast-paced action

-smooth graphics

-cool music

-great unlockables

-many more!

while the controls for attacking were quite difficult to learn, the overall game is fun, and i recomend those who are reading this and want the game to play with friends.

Great... just great...

"
23961,Play it solo its way more fun...
23962,good game..
23963,"Great to play with friends, but gets quite repetitive at times. Also you need to play with friends or your chance of having fun is quite low

7/10"
23964,"perfect game
"
23965,"Castle crashers
a co-op multiplayer (or singleplayer...) where you and your 3 friends play as knights and save 4 princesses against evil villains, from barbarians vs ninjas vs monsters your going to have one crazy adventure aswell funny and silly moments happening in every level. worth the money and worth your time"
23966,"As someone who grew up with flash games on Newgrounds, this could do no wrong. It's good ol' beat em up, responsive controls, good combos and great fun. Got it for 3 euros, which is obviously a steal. Recommended."
23967,"This game is fun to play alone, but more fun if you play it with ur friend, unique gameplay, easy control, nice graphic that makes this game is nice, you can also play offline with your friend with controller"
23968,One of the best beat'em ups I've played :P
23969,I have no words ... This game is AWESOME .....
23970,It's Gud Stuff m8's!
23971,"this fun game
"
23972,Too good to pass up. Want something to entertain some friends with here it is. Easy to pick up and jump into. Usually games that are too goofy I pass on; not this one. Everyone I play this with loves it.
23973,An accurate depiction of the Third Crusade
23974,"YES, is a great game and is very funny. Chalenging at times. You can unlock almost any character that you fight so this game is fun just to complete, you can collect weapons and pets all which have different effects. If you play this please use a controler, I can't fatham if it is even possible to play this with a keyboard (Probibly isn't)."
23975,"i've played 44 hours of this game and its still fun. altho i have finished the game a total of 5 times and accidently deleted my save file but adleast i can now restart my character. in my opinion you should get this aswel its multiplayer conpatible and theres endless fun. -thx game creators you really did a good job XD.

"
23976,"This game is great, got it gifted from a friend. It has a great sense of humor and it's also fun to play."
23977,This game is a hilarious and action packed game! Every boss has you holding your breath and waiting for the most epic duel ever! With a amazing variety of heroes to choose from you never feel limited. I would recommend this game over and over again!
23978,i got battle block theatre recently so i got this while on sale and it is just amazing like battle block
23979,"You SHOULD buy this game:
-This game is so funny
-If u are playing Battleblock threater it can give u 1 character from here to there
-can play this in 1 PC(NO need another man to play with)
-NOT only singleplayer
I recommend for you to buy this game
+You can play this with your family(belive me its fun!!!!!!!!)
Bye."
23980,"Fun game with a friend. Get a controller. And no, a joystick does not count. Trust me."
23981,"I enjoyed this game immensly and it is fun and cute!
"
23982,Gosto
23983,"fun game, especially with some good ol' buds, had some great banther with the boys"
23984,This is the really nice game for a group of friends or when you want play some nice stuff with your gf/bf. 8/10. awesome soundtrack and gameplay ;)
23985,I rode a deer that was propelled by the power of its explosive diarrhea. 11/10
23986,"As singeplayer it can be quite infuriating to play against bosses and whatnot.

With friends its one of the best games ever made."
23987,this is very good game . i like this game
23988,very fun game
23989,"Good quality gamplay, coop and multiplayer, cheap what more can one want?"
23990,"The reason i boguht this game was:

1. It was on sale
2. I've watched people play this game in 1 or 2 years ago so I really wanted to try this game.

Very fun with friends but I didn't buy this for co-op but solo is still very fun. 

Solo is quite hard at the back of the story so I kidnapped my friend and forced him to play with me.

I give this game a 9.0/10 in total."
23991,:D
23992,Very great and its a great game too grind for!
23993,"Actualy i played this game for first time on an xbox with a friend and i alwas liked, then i download the game for free (yes, it was a pirated version), but when i saw this game on steam i realise i need to buy it and so i did.

And now i'm enyoing the game whit my frien <3

This is a masterpiece of ""The behemoth"" it's all i can say about this game."
23994,Even though i had a very short time playing it. It was pretty fun
23995,"This game reminds me of Saturday Morning cartoons.  Cornball humor and useful and not so useful weapons and gear to match. I had fun playing this coop multiplater. Simple game combos are allowed; Weirdly named magic is mandatory. 

"
23996,:)
23997,9/10 not enough shitting deer
23998,I really liked the cartoon graphics and music
23999," i love this game, i played it long ago on console and had so much fun. i came back to it on pc and had a refreshing nostalgic expireince. Castle crashers has so much to offer, give it a try."
24000,"Easy to play platformer.  Sometimes glitchy over network, but features lots of weapons and pets to earn (granted most of them one will not want as there are some early on that are really what one will use)."
24001,Childhood favorite. id buy the muisic on itunes
24002,"A really fun and smart game! I would love for everyone to play it!



















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































but when enemys spam arrows I want to die"
24003,"Pretty good. You can do up to 4 people on 1 system. You can do 4 wired Xbox 360 controllers or 3 wired controllers and someone uses the keyboard controls. Its worth the money for when you buy it, the DLC guys are OK, and overall one of my favorite games of all time. Good gameplay, and has a very hard final boss. Im suprised how this game isnt that popular, since its my favorite game by the Behemoth."
24004,"This game is awesome behemoth studios should work on castle crasher 2 I would pre order it the day it was avalible for preorder I think this game was awesome I just wosh there was more game to this game I really liked it but wish I had more gameplay because it was so awesome I also would like to see more upgrade stats to give me more to get even after I have beaten the game this was a trully amazing experice that I would recommend for anyone who wants a classic felling beat em up it is super fun to play with freind and to grind to get higher levels is even fun 10/10 would buy again.
"
24005,"Fun, exciting, once you get far into the game you can't stop."
24006,"So much fun. Still remember this badass game from the early days, and I'm glad to finally play it after all those years. In my opinion, one of Behemoth's classic games that grew on popularity asnd fun very quickly."
24007,"It was fun at first, but the fricken arrow enemies, they will just not stop spamming their f-ing arrows. they give you no time to get back up, and you have to resort to just jumping around, hoping you manage to hit one of them, if it wasn't for this, i'd give the game a good review."
24008,Good!
24009,fun fun fun ahahahahahahaha
24010,"Awesome game, we need more local coop games like this!"
24011,Fun game to mess around in
24012,Sweet coop game.
24013,I love this game I had this game on xbox 360 and have like 1000 hours just beating this game and playing and it never gets boring. I recommend this game. IT IS AWESOME
24014,it's great and alot of replayability if ur into that :P
24015,Fun for one. Or more.
24016,"great game, fun game play, could use carecter personalization thought."
24017,One of the best Coop games out there.
24018,Great side scrolling beat-em up. Worth every penny!
24019,its good game
24020,GUD
24021,Loved this game the moment I first saw it on the playstation. Glad its available on steam. No regrets buying this game :)
24022,Fun game lots of things to do fun with friends and is a great game :D
24023,best game
24024,n1
24025,Where am i simulator 2017.
24026,good game
24027,"Ive always wanted this game as a kid and i've been watching since the game first came out,  when i got home from school i've always just sat on the couch and started watching castle crashers i talked about it with my friends in school and i loved watching 4 guys fucking around on castle crashers competing for number 1 on either stats or battles. Now that i have castle crashers im going to buy it for my friend and play with my other friends so we can enjoy the same experience."
24028,"As you can see I have quite a few hours on this game. I never thought to review the game until 'Pit People' was recently released, which I also recommend. This was my first ever 'Behemoth Games' game, and I would recomend the game to anyone, except my mother that is, as she is not a fan of crude humour, which takes place from time to time in this game. The narraration is great. The gameplay is exciting and challenging at times, and it is TONS of fun with friends. In my opinion it is the best Behemoth to start with. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did :D (Also, the DLC is worth it IMO, especially the pink knight, hes my favorite)

Sincerely, 
Big Kandy <3"
24029,It's good I guess.
24030,"This game very hard, very fun, very cute 10/10"
24031,nice game
24032,fun
24033,"Great game to kill time. My fiance and I play a lot. Many hours of yelling at eachother but it's all in good fun. Best part is when I got the girl in one of the first few scenes and he kind of looked at me like ""that's my job...to get the girl"" lol. Recommended!"
24034,The gameplay is very fun
24035,10/10
24036,fun with friends
24037,"Game originally for platform that I hate (Xbox),but now here on Steam. I like this game and its batter with 3 more people to play with. 9.0/10"
24038,good game
24039,:))))
24040,"Fantastic game!
I don't have a controller, and keyboard controls are very weird. Only when i remapped the entire thing was the keyboard usable. Other than that, great game!"
24041,Can't stop playing
24042,It's a good game when you have friends to play with
24043,Great game. Luv it
24044,Fun with good friends ahah
24045,"Great game if you play with some friends. The campaign isn't very long but I've played it like 30 times. The replayability is great. The thing is, the story isn't that important. Developing many characters with different ability's (mainly magic) is very enjoyable. The best thing about this game is the ability to play with friends. Especially at the beginning and during the insane mode. At this point teamwork and skill becomes key, because enemies hit like a truck and have like 5 times the hp of normal mode."
24046,Great Game And Fun Expirience Playing With Friends I Would Like A Sequel!
24047,Really nice game i really love Hatty and his Powers and some nice minigames as well :D
24048,"Funny, enjoyable and easy on the pocket. Everything one would want from a hack and slash game."

24059,Dope game.
24060,Nice Game to play with friends !
24061,"This game has tons of characters to play and weapons to fight with. The content is very diversified, even though there are signs of crude humor. Overall, I strongly recommend this masterpiece."
24062,Good multiplayer game.
24063,"10000%  Recommended, it´s perfect to play with friends."

24071,Cool game
24072,"OMFG THE NOSTALGIC MEMORIES OF GAME BRINGS me back to the old days, where I sit my fat A** on the couch and play this game on my xbox 360 with my friends... I RECOMMEND YOU TO PLAY THIS WITH AT LEAST ONE FRIEND! :D"
24073,10/10
24074,"I bought this game just to play with my siblings. So I put the controllers, and all four of us playing on the same screen.
The game itself has a funny storyline and side story.
It takes your skill and combo to beat this game because there is nothing like ""I wanna be a tanker"" or ""Leave it to me"" when fighting the hordes of weird armies.

7/10 - My overall rating on this masterpiece."
24075,An enjoyable coop experience. Highly recommended to play with a friend as it's not as fun playing it alone.

24077,"Got this game in the sale and been enjoying it a lot so far, played it wih friends and alone and have to say it's both really fun."
24078,ok
24079,"Castle Crashers is by far one of the most fun and funny games i played recently.
you can play it alone or co-op with friends all you need is just 1 friend and you are good to go and experience the fun and adventure that the game takes you too.
Some of the control are a bit tricky but you will master it after you will play for a bit.
Overall i think this is a great game definitely  a must buy on my opinion 10/10.
i highly recomand to check ""The behemoth"" other games like BattleBlock theater that i recommand as well you can check my review [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/amirmois/recommended/2384] Here [/url]"
24080,cool
24081,Love it! So silly but fun at the same time.
24082,Fun
24083,"I don't know, this game didn't fit me. In my opinion the progression in this game is  slow, I mean, it seems that it should be much faster. However you may have quite fun when you are playing with your friends. So if you enjoy playing with your friends most of time you may like this game. If you are more of a solo player I don't recommend."
24084,Noice game when you're bored with friend.
24085,Fun game
24086,"Many years later, Still an awesome game!"
24087,"good gaem, i wish my dad was in it"
24088,Good craic
24089,"This game was on sale for $2.99 (USD w/o tax) and it's very cheap. I love the game for both the price, and the game itself. Plus the new ""ultra"" or maximum graphics performance made the game more smooth and I am running in a low end computer and it is running this game very smoothly."
24090,"If you have friends who have this game - go for it! It has nice humor and quite good gameplay. 
If you want to play splitscreen - you MUST have a 360 controller, otherwise the controls won't work."
24091,"This is honestly one of the many games you can sit down and play with your friends for hours!

                                                                                                                                        ~TheAngryCaRoT"
24092,Makes me wish I had friends!!!
24093,Beat this game several times as long as your playing with friends you'll never get bored. Recommend if you have friends willing to buy it.

24099,great and epic game

24102,memes rock

24105,A classic and will last beyond ages of content and stand against time
24106,"i luv this game m a  mgate



its well deviolope



JOEBIM"
24107,I Recommend it to play with your frinds. Such a funny game. Easy combat system and hilarious graphics. Surprising funny moments. Sweet memory of sh*tting deer <3.
24108,is gut boi
24109,this game will ruin friendships over who kisses the princess
24110,"Honestly one of the best purchases I've made, got copies for my friends as well and it's a blast"
24111,A very nice game to spend your tme.It is even better when you have a friend to play it with.The Co-op in this game is just amazing.I totally recomend it.
24112,"Buy this on sale, you wont regret it"
24113,"Fun game with online coop and easy to invite friend to play with you. But it is a bit lag if one of your friend have slow internet connection. There are ton of characters, sword, pet and more secret you can get that make the game has good point in replaying 

buy it now in the summer sale and for your friend. All of you will have good time"
24114,"Great game to pass the time. Enjoyed playing multiple runs with my 3 other buddies. If you are looking for a fun 4 player co-op game, this should definitely be on your radar. I must say though after playing the game so long, the game does get a little repetitive and farmy because the story is very short, but I still had tons of fun playing it when unlocking new characters."
24115,Das sum gud shit
24116,The game still holds up today and its very rewarding to learn juggling
24117,I absoulutly love it is a fun game but some levels can be difficult to beat but once you level up weapons and get items it is easier i hope you get this game because you will love it!!
24118,"This is far than a great game is rather short but you will enjoy every moment when playing it, you will no regret buying it besides you can play it with your firends. And if you dont have you can play online with strangers . I totally recommned this game"
24119,Boring after like 10 minutes
24120,great game i recommend!
24121,"This game is really fun, i found myself playing countless hours with my friends"
24122,"it's lit lmao
"
24123,Amazing thats all i have to say and please use a controller
24124,good
24125,This game is really addictive but tthe story could have been bigger even tho you can still have fun in the arena or collection new characters with friends
24126,"Personally, I love it. It's co-op so you can play with your friends and work together. I love the wacky levels and the bosses. The soundtrack is amazing, it has good humor, and is a great beat'em up. I do recommend though that you play with 4 players. The hardest difficulty (insane mode) is actually hard. You don't see that in some games where the hardest difficulty isn't hard at all. Castle Crashers went above and beyond, and turned out a great success. With the VS mode you can fight your friends. Another way the game has players fight (that I love) is when you beat a boss there is a princess. The players fight and the last man standing gets to kiss the princess. The game is silly, but in the best way. Those of you who don't have this game. . . GET IT!!!"
24127,trooollloooo
24128,"Great humor,interesting bosses,fluid gameplay, and a gorgeous artstyle. Castle Crashers is a great game,singleplayer or multiplayer. However while their is a little bit of replay value with new unlockable characters,it only took me 11 hours to beat the campaign. My philosophy is 1 dollar per hour. I bought it while it was on sale for 2.99. So I definitely recommend the game at around 10 bucks,but not the asking price."
24129,bo som phán
24130,Very good game to play with friends.
24131,cool and good
24132,Old game but still good!
24133,"Interesting storyline, definitely an enjoyable game to play with friends. Recommend to play with controller."
24134,DAD HELP
24135,"I would definitely play this game with Robin. It's a nice side scroller that comes with crossover characters from other games such as BattleBlock Theatre. 

You also get to beat the crap out of your friends occasionally, which Robin would definitely enjoy.


The game is personally more enjoyable if you have a full party of 4. An easy feat for Robin, who has an unsurmountable number of friends. 

This game is also very relatable. There is one level that has a deer that is powered purely by fear and fesces, which I feel accurately describes me.

However, there is one issue with the game. Sometimes the game desyncs and I really don't know how to explain it other than saying that if you play with four people and it desyncs, you will be split into teams of two and will be forced to fight the stage with your other partner and the ghost of the other two."
24136,"So originally, I didn't want to get this game because it seemed like a not so good game even for the summmer sale price..but my friend eventually got me the game and I have to say that it's very enjoyable, it's a great multiplayer game with very simple controls and the cool thing is that you unlock combos as you level up..id say that this game in my opinion isn't worth 15$, but 3$ for sure I would get it(I got it for free anyways so I'm not complaining)"
24137,Can somebody help me finsh insane mode ? :3
24138,Dope.
24139,awesome
24140,10/10
24141,"This game is fun. How ever there is not much content in the game,
you will be finished after 7h so do not buy castle crashers. Its not wort it, not even on a realy good deal."
24142,fantastic game as it always has been
24143,I've played this game for years with different friends and it never gets old. That last princess really is the most beautiful of all.
24144,Its Awesome! Had this game on ps3 when it came out. Maxed out all characters and dlc ones also. Now to do it again. Jump on multiplayer and lets play
24145,"+ Well done, cartoon art style
+ 4 player online or local co-op

- Combat is shallow
- Combo windows/buffering is delayed and unresponsive, and forces a button mash approach to everything
- There is no wake up invulnerability after being knocked down, resulting in you being tossed about like a rag doll 

- Almost all enemies aren't fun to fight: 
-- Small mobs just spam abilities with no warning that constantly knock you down
-- Large brutes don't flinch, can't reliably be combo'd, frequently grab and throw you around, and hit like trucks
-- All bosses are terrible, frustrating, and tedious. A chore to fight against any of them

- The rpg aspects of this game are not well implemented, and feel like they were thrown in to pad out the game
-- A bad stat build results in the game slowing to a crawl
-- At higher levels it takes forever to get stat points
-- Generally turns the game into a grind fest

- The game technically is unpolished
-- Foreground elements can block onscreen gameplay
-- Your character's sprite layer must to be placed in front of an enemy's sprite layer for an attack to register
-- The character can get stuck on seemingly nothing if their sprite layer is behind an object's sprite layer

- Most weapons are useless, and have unintelligible stat point placements
- You can only carry a small number of health potions, making it impossible to brute force bosses or levels 
- There is no difficulty options, so you can't run though the game on a easier difficulty, and then run through a harder difficulty with a higher level character

Overall, this is a mediocre beat em up with tacked on rpg elements, that turn an ok game into a grindy, frustrating, and tedious mess of a chore.
I do not recommend this at all."
24146,Best game. 10/10
24147,shitty level design and enemies
24148,"It's a neat
"
24149,"Oh My Goodness, The Adventure, The Button-Mashing, Its Perfect, And Only $2.99? (At The Time Of Writing This)"
24150,After all This game is Pretty good Lvl.24 on Green Knight  I reccomend Buying this.
24151,Super fun animation and very enjoyable game with friends :D.
24152,its a really fun game to play but i recomend to play it with friends. :D
24153,best game ever
24154,just a hole load of fun get 4 mates and you got your self a good night lol
24155,"Great game, I highly reccomend it!"
24156,A friend and I started playing this game and after about 10h of playtime it was boring. After about 4 month we tried it again and it was pretty fun!
24157,10/10
24158,Cheese
24159,Good game I guess
24160,its nice
24161,"My friend send a copy of this game to me,and we play together.
It is fun to play with friends.
Be careful when playing this game though... it is like a time machine.
Have to go to bed at midnight? Nevermind! It is already 3 am !!
something like that could happen..."
24162,I've bought this game on 3 different platforms and im never bored when i play this game! Its a must have game in my opinion
24163,very fun with friends and fun on your own
24164,Great Game
24165,great game to play on a couch with friends! it has lots of fun bosses and challenging levels. The only downside is that you have to reach certain levels for the game to save
24166,"I was introduced to this game by my little brothers since they had bought the game on the Xbox 360 marketplace (or was it indie store? I can't remember.) I liked the art style but I never had found the time to play the game since they hogged the Xbox. Fast forward to a couple weeks back, my boyfriend had bought it for me on my birthday and we ended up spending 9 hours in it (and will continue to pour more in.)

Pros:
-A good Newgrounds game.
-It is a funny game but some of the humor is for middle schoolers (but I still get a chuckle out of it, don't get me wrong.)
-Adorable art style.
-Each character has its own unique magic.
-The Pink Knight is just so adorable.
-Challenging, at times.
-FIGHT TO THE DEATH FOR THE WAIFU'S KISS (in co-op).
-Variety of enemies and weapons.
-Aliens.
-Replayability and jolly co-op!

Cons:
-It is short. 
-Sometimes, the animations glitch, but that's alright.

Rating: 10/10
I cannot find one thing to hate about this game. I recommend picking it up. It is worth the 15 bucks."
24167,"One of my favourite games of all time. Played it on PS3 with my Blue Knight and loved it, now playing it on PC and still running that Blue Knight. 

10/10 Content
10/10 DLC; (only 2 exist and the ones that you needed to buy on Xbox can be unlocked in Insane mode on PC)

24180,"Its a nice button mashing game, you MIGHT not like pvp tho since its all about luck there, if both of you are lucky then its button mashing skills. meele is tho not luck based which is nice but you should get prepared before you go because weapons and pets are allowed there. 7/10"
24181,"My favourite The Behemoth title of all time, and one of my top 10 favourite games of all time. It is a very simple, silly, and all around fun. It is, as with most The Behemoth titles, soooo much more fun with friends (and with a controller). Once you beat the game you will absoulutely be wanting more, so why not jump back in the game as a different character, and I may sound like a broken record but this game is so much more fun with friends (and a controller)."
24182,"I spent so much of my childhood playing this game on my PlayStation and let me tell you, one of the best games I have ever played!"
24183,Great game with hours of fun gameplay!
24184,This is the best game for friends to play. Ever.
24185,"Everyone's at least heard of Castle Crashers. Not everyone knows what exactly it is.
Well, friends, take a seat, and get comfortable, because you'll be there for a long time.

This game is unlike any other, a cartoony yet bloody side-scroller beat-em-up packed with hilarity. Knowing Behemoth, the humor is what they like to focus on. Even the most menacing monsters and darkest situations are made goofy by the constant over-the-top gags.

It has a good length, taking me and two friends around 20 total hours to beat the first time. It has a reasonable level of difficulty, which (I suspect) is amped-up depending on how many people are playing. Speaking of, I can definitely say that this game is made infinitely better with more people, preferably two friends, as it was a blast for us.

A simple, humorous, and very satisfying game with the drawback of being boring without friends. 9/10"
24186,"10/10 would write a shitting deer to victory away from a black monster of death while my friend keeps hitting walls and yelling ""I AM THE TANK I DO WHAT I WANT"""
24187,"simple and addicting game,and run smoothly on low end pc.
i love the part when you must battle ur friend for get the princess.haha"
24188,"this is the best indie game on xbox 360, buy it and enjoy it"
24189,"I wandered back to this page (years after finishing the game) and realized I never gave this game a review. This game holds a special place in my heart because it was the first game I played on my current computer. This game is great and you should really consider getting it.

PROS:
-VERY FUNNY (lot of toilet humor)
-wonderful art, very different from other games
-epic music
-good controls
-best played with friends
-best played with controller
-long story
-frequently on sale

CONS:
-kinda generic story, but that only hightens the humor
-not as funny to play by yourself
-bogus dlc
-not much wrong with it

Get it; but round up another friend or family member to play before you buy it."
24190,This game was the game of my childhood on the xbox 360 Best Game 10/10

24194,👌
24195,"This is one of greatest games I've ever played, You should defintley play it especially with friends it is so much fun, there isn't that much to do, you will beat the game fast but only for 15 dollars it is worth it and besides this game goes on sale quite a lot."
24196,"Fun action packed game, if you were to get it then get a controller, the game gets a little repetitive and dry in some parts but overall I really recommend the game for a group of friends."
24197,"totaly recommend it , quit hard to play multyplayer tho"
24198,"2017 and ths game still rocks... <3 
A-W-E-S-O-M-E fun with the boiiiiiiz"
24199,This Game Is............. Wonderful and it will make u crack up!
24200,"This game is great! Glad to finally play another game by the people who made BattleBlock Theater. Good level of difficulty (even on Easy), fun characters,cool weapons. Just great fun!"
24201,It's a fun game to play with friends but alone it gets boring and real hard after the introduction of the sandwich.
24202,"This is one of the first games I bought here on steam. It's a fun linair game wich doesn't require a lot of skill in the beginning, but near the end you will need it... 

Maybe one of the best things is game has to offer, is the fact that you can play it with up to three friends/randoms online. This makes the game way more fun, because you can ask for help or healing when you are in need.

The story isn't that complicated, you are just a knight who is out to save the kidnapped princesses and beat the main villain.

The graphics are simple but enjoyable and goes hand in hand with the lovely music.

Overall I would recommend Castle Crashers for sure. I'ts a fun co-op game that brings a smile on everyones face. So if you haven't bought this, be sure to check it out."

24211,very fun game with friends !!!
24212,"Grew up playing this with my brother, One of my favourite games to play in a group."
24213,"Honestly my favorite game of all time. Great story, great gameplay."
24214,"Absolustely loved this game, a must have for any steam user!!"
24215,"hey, hello, it's 2008 again!! but to be real, this is a good beat-em-up and is very fun with friends or online. story is straightforward and simple, and the humor is very.... uh... 2008-ish. the DLC is okay, get it if you're interested, or it's on sale or something. good game 9/10."
24216,"If you have 15 bucks aka $15 US dollars buy the game or how much it is worth. I got it for 7 bucks and it is probably the best 7 bucks I ever spent. This game is like any other multiplayer game, hard and sad alone but fun and easy with friends.
I got 4 copies of this game and gave 2 away to fags and now i have 1 more copy. 
If you want that copy you can ask me or if i gave it away dont add me.
Well lets talk about this game, it has is a cartoon, button mashing (if your playing on steam controller) fast paced game.
There are 4 default characters to choose from a red, orange ,green and another one. They each have an ability and their playstyle is different.
P.S This is my first time doing a review more that 5 sentence"
24217,Very fun and good game!
24218,lol more like home wreckers they shagged my wife
24219,"What.

The.

Fuck.

10/10"
24220,"This game is absoultly goregous! Its one of the games you grab a couple friends and play through levels and ultimatly just have a good time! The only thing i recommened when your about to buy this game is to just wait for it to go on sale. The reason I say this is because the game's story mode isnt as long as you would think, but definitly worth while, and persoanlly i think the story mode in this game is what makes this game great so im just recommending you buy it on sale.
10/10 would beat barbarrion again."
24221,"pretty fun party game lol

srsly tho i would buy full price 10/9"
24222,"Wonderful game with plenty of characters to play, offers some challenge too."
24223,"It was fun for the first few hours, then it got so button mashy that my hands started to hurt."
24224,"GOOD GAME
"
24225,"wow! if u liked knights and dragons© then youll love castel crasher!

24226,Awsome game to play with friends and fam
24227,"Great game to hop on with a couple of friends and grind for a few hours. Game gets boring when you finish it once, but you can play as other characters if you want."
24228,"I love this game!! Especially with friends! Its very silly, fun and I get to kiss the princess! Its a must play if you like silly games."
24229,I absolutely love everything about this game from the graphics to the little bits of comedy.
24230,its my birthday
24231,Good 17/5
24232,A lot of fun especially when you play co-op!
24233,Hell yeah!
24234,"Best enjoyed when played with friends. Castle crashers is a game offering galore of comedy, from fart jokes to silent humour, all whilst trying to defeat an enemy hordes or bosses and collect coins. The overall themes and simplicity allow a wind down for any day. Thanks to variety of provided mini-games, if you would become tired with progressing the story, you can always switch to one of the mini games; eg. arena, back off barbarian. If these do not sate your appetite you can always play a volleyball.

As an end note, I can happily endorse this game for anyone looking to play a coop game with friends that doesn't require a high amount of concentration or competition."
24235,"Wicked cute and fun game. If you find cartoony-style cool, definitely recommend because it's very easy on the eyes.  Smooth look and works great, DLC is actual DLC and not needed to finish game. Makes me very angry so it must be a good game."
24236,I LOVE THIS GAME.
24237,10/10 again would pair with rando strangers to save a princess and kill each other.
24238,nice game
24239,"Отличная игра с неплохим сюжетом, незабываемыми боссами, коорперативом для 4-ёх человек, но есть и обратная сторона монеты-маленький онлайн"
24240,"This is the most fun I've had with a beat 'em up in a long time. If you want a game that juggles comedy and gameplay almost flawlessly, Castle Crashers is pretty much the perfect game for you. I got the game as a gift, but it is very much worth full price anyhow."
24241,Great game (But kinda a rage game.)
24242,"Cool game m8s, fun playing the campaing with your friends, you dont get tierd"
24243,Awesome battles that leave you either laughing or trying your hardest to not die.
24244,If you can get some friends to play with you it's definetely worth it :D
24245,"Fun to play, but not to replay."
24246,"This gaem is fun and i wuld recomend it 

i will r8 this game m8
8/8

Thes is fun
"
24247,Another great couch co-op game. Totally worth it.
24248,"About every year or so me and three other buddies get together and play this game comletely through. (Takes about 8 hours or 6 if you're really good)

Its amazing. I just wish the campaign was longer."
24249,"Castle crashers is the end-all be-all of beat-em-ups.

The enemies are unique, there's a hoard of obtainable weaponry, ranging from swords to swordfish.
The fighting feels right, the combos are simply satisfying and it just gets better with co-op.

10/10, skeleton army ftw"
24250,"I love Those Pooping Animals That Pooped! That Made Me Laugh!
"
24251,...
24252,"Its and amazing game...
Love it.
Actually one of my top 3 games

To people who dosent own this game.. Buy it QUICK damnit"
24253,"It's like huniepop , but with kissing."
24254,"Great game. Fun to play. Tons of replay value
"
24255,Ya its good idk
24256,"Played this game on Xbox 360 back in 2012. When I saw it on steam, I immediately bought it. Probably the most nostalgic game ever made by Behemoth."
24257,Funny game. Get a copy for a friend and have at it. Very entertaining game.
24258,Funny...
24259,too short.
24260,"""10/10""

- One of the best absurd games with ""Battleblock Theater"" (the same developer and designers) and very fun to play with friends.

*An obligatory purchase*"
24261,"Ride a deer powered by fear shits, kill demonic corn, this game is even more fun with friends"
24262,"Amazing and full of all brows of comedy. It is really fun and I nearly choked on my breakfast during the first forest level. 8/10 for an awesome game, with ugly representations of female characters. They did it better in pit people."
24263,"Ammazing platformer game. Grab some friends and enjoy the ride of a llifetime. I remember being 10 and playing this on newgrounds for free, and i gladly paid for the steam version to play with my friends at the age of 23"
24264,This game brings back such good memories. When I was in middle school me and my friends would play this on xbox 360 and now years later I still really enjoy it! This is one of the few games where two people can play together on the same computer. It is so much more fun with other people!
24265,very awsome
24266,"Great game, I remember playing years ago, and it is still just as good.."
24267,I played this a lot on the PS3 it was pretty good
24268,"Gets repetitive very quickly. Though the combat and graphics are solid, the gameplay essentially boils down to a simplistic button-mashing formula that later becomes more annoying than fun."
24269,very fun 2 play with friends
24270,"Castle Crashers is a beat-em-up with a heavy multiplayer focus. While the game works and doesn’t become overwhelming in singleplayer, this game got its reputation for its multiplayer. The more the merrier, but even playing with just one friend can be a hoot. And with its constant sales, it isn’t too hard to pick up, either.
But what of the game itself? Castle Crashers is a rather short game to beat if you aren’t going for Hard Mode. However, its short length may be a blessing, as the entirety of it is a good time that’s just fun to play. There are plenty of unique enemies per area that don’t get stale and the game’s aesthetics and art direction make each screen nice to look at. Plus, the game has so much charm put into it. You can actually get a good amount of mileage out of the game by replaying it, either to show it to a new friend or even just to pick up one day after being like, “I kinda wanna play Castle Crashers.” The only problem you might run into here is you may need to completely refresh all of the progress on a character you got a high level if you want to play them from the start.
That isn’t too much of a problem, though. Castle Crashers has an absolute myriad of characters to unlock and choose from. And this unlocking feature also adds on to the game’s “postgame” beyond Hard Mode, as hunting down each condition to unlock a character or each animal buddy is rather fun even after beating the game. And all of these characters and animal buddies all have different attributes (the most noticeable being all of the different magic), so playing as a new character might give off a slightly different experience just by being a different character. That doesn’t even mention the level up points system, where you can level up things like health, attack, speed, or magic every time you level up for different character builds. 
Castle Crashers may be relatively short, but it makes up for that with its variety and its multiplayer-driven gameplay, You can even play with strangers online if you want; I used to LOVE playing through Hard Mode and helping strangers through it over and over. So give this game a try; it’s a classic for a reason!"
24271,do not recommend if you are playing with friends online. game desyncs the screens all the time. singleplay and multiplay is good.
24272,"One of my favorites, especially with friends!"
24273,"its an ok game with friends, it gets pretty boring solo"
24274,Very fun game to play as a duo or more (solo is fine) The storyline is fun but if your a achivement hunter the achivements are pretty hard to get especially Arena Master and The Final Countdown!
24275,"This is a great game to play with friends, you can play by your self but I recommend to play with friends."
24276,"kid gaem, noob"
24277,"Lots of humour and cool design (and saying wtf out loud)

Lots of grinding, especially if you're alone (play this with friends)

Lots of clicking (do not play within hearing range of people who do not approve the clicking)

Lots of fun"
24278,"i love this game very much
"
24279,"+Great beat'em up game 
+Nice humor
+Tons of unlockables (characters , weapons , and animal orbs) 
+Awesome level design and soundtrack
+Nice mini-games to expand the playtime
+It has a decent replay value
+Only 200 MB :o 

-the only flaw is that the campaign is a little bit short but that doesn't keep it from being a beautiul gem 

I recommend to play this game with friends (4 players)  

P.S: I love the last princess :*"
24280,"I loved this game very much, there is so much to do in it despite it seeming to have low replay value, the unlockables and wide variety of enemies and playable characters will send you playing it over and over again, even after accidentally deleting my save file, I still got back to playing it. Unlocking all the characters, pets, and weapons kept me determined to find it all. And even with the gameplay, the game also has an extreme amount of soul and character, playing it really feels like you're playing a labor of love."
24281,"because this looks similar to pit people im giving it a negative











jk this game is super fun and never gets old













i fucking hate pit people"
24282,good
24283,"so good its dank 100
"
24284,"played this game 350+ hours on xbox 360, love it. idc if this isn't helpful for others, i liked it"
24285,the best 2d game i ever experienced and i love the multplayer with my friends. i suggest the guys who wanna buy this game. just buy the 4 pack so you can share it with your friends
24286,Can 'never' find a multiplayer session.
24287,Playwithmeplaywithmeplaywithme!
24288,A highly entertaining party beat 'em up for up to 4 players featuring a unique and appealing cartoon artstyle. The story is characterized by its loveable silliness and humor. The game's main campaign is fairly short which however is offset by the availability of special challenge and duel modes. Without a doubt a great recommendation for anyone looking for a game to play with friends & family!
24289,"Its a game to just relax and have fun with your friends.
A mind refresher from too many fps and moba i guess"
24290,"Really like this games for playing whit friends. Nice graphic, good game play and lots of fun :P"
24291,One of the best couch coop game
24292,Bad game I kissed a clown 1 out of 4 red knights
24293,"ahh, where do I begin this game was fantastic and still is played it on xbox and don't have friends so that sucks rodney big up JLS TSM CLG"
24294,"This is a gem. The soundtrack absolutly amazing. The gameplay is great. The bosses have some exellent, some frustrating, and some forgetable. The story was decent enough for me, although it's kind of basic."
24295,This game is good. (GPD WIN)
24296,Really enjoyable and charming beat 'em up!
24297,its a bit old but good
24298,Awesome game to play with friends or just looking for some mindless gameplay. Played across all platforms. Would buy if you and your buds need a game to play together.
24299,asdfghjkl
24300,"buncha bros hanging out making poop jokes

really funny guys"
24301,"This game is great fun with a few friends and a challenging dungeon crawler in single player.  There is a story, but in the end i5s and old school beat em' up.  I personally really enjoy the fighting and silly nature of the game.  While it may not be a serious game, its silly and fun enough that i keep coming back for more"
24302,"A decent singleplayer game, and a fantastic multiplayer experience. I most certainly reccomend to anyone trying to find the next game for them and their freinds."
24303,"Fun beat-em-up with quite rewarding character progression. The game is relatively short and it has limited replay value (when alone), though completionists will be able to squeeze more hours out of the game. 

If you don't know whether to buy the game, buy a four-pack when the game is on sale. It's much more fun with friends. Playing with friends also extends the game's ""lifespan"".

PS: use a controller if available"
24304,its pretty good
24305,its GREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAT
24306,"VERY GOOD, CANT STOP, SEND NO HELP PLS, WAIT. this was a false review and you all just looked at my hours"
24307,bon is gay lmao
24308,Very gud gaem go bui
24309,Fun with friends and when you're alone rethinking about your life decisions 10/10
24310,Good.
24311,it's okay
24312,I love Crashing Castles.
24313,This game is highly recommended to play with some several friends you know. Very fun beat em up rpg with some huge variety of characters you can unlock.
24314,"This game is a good game to sit around with a bunch of friends and just play. Not the funniest game I've played, but still made us all laugh a lot. Good simple controls, and a hell of a lot of fun."
24315,get it.
24316,"I've been playing this game since it came out on the Xbox 360 back in 2008, and bought it on Steam a couple years ago to revisit on of my favorite co-op experiences of all time.  Even to this day I enjoy throwing this game on to tear through the story and juggle enemies with my little brothers.

[h1] PROS [/h1]

[b] +Charming hand-drawn animation. [/b]

[b] +Level design. [/b]
One of the best parts of the game is exploring the world that Behemoth has developed. There are tons of levels that look and play completely differently from one another. With flowery fields, sandy deserts, slippery icy terrains, and high speed rivers, it's clear that every single level was made with passion. And there's never a boring stretch of land, since there's always something interesting on the playing field or in the background making the environment truly come to life. 

[b] +Even the grossest, most terrifying monsters are still cute as hell. [/b]

[b] +Constant gore and potty humor. [/b]

[b] +Character customization. [/b]
Choose your favorite character, level them up, and place their stats to whatever fits your play-style.

[b] +Tons of weapons. [/b]
There's many weapons that can affect your stats in both positive and negative ways. Throughout the game you won't want to stop searching for something that looks even cooler and has better stats, so expect to search through each level closely for some secret gear. 

[b] +Animal orbs. [/b]
Ohhhhh yes. The cutest things Behemoth has ever created. There's about 30 of these little bastards hiding across the map, and of course it's up to you to collect them all. After you catch them you can chose to have them follow you as your companion. Each animal helps you out in different ways; for example, the ram charges into your enemies, the owl brings you food, the tiger increases your agility, and the giraffe allows you to earn more xp. 

[b] +Four player local and online co-op. [/b]

[h1] CONS [/h1]

[b] -Can be pretty slow at certain parts of the game. [/b]

[b] -Expect a tedious grind. [/b]

[b] -Not very fun when you're playing alone. [/b]

[b] -Online servers can be kinda wonky. [/b]

[h1] Overall score: [/h1] [b] 8.75/10 [/b]"
24317,I recommend it!
24318,My Favorite Game. EVer.
24319,"I thought I was spending my money on what some people call ""crap."" BUT NO! I ENDED UP PLAYING THIS GAME IN ALL OF MY SPARE TIME! I've only spent maybe 25 hours playing this game! There are at least 50 more pros than cons in this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
24320,Fun indie game to play with friends. Controller support for Xbox/Ps4 and steam controllers. Has a battleblock feel kinda.
24321,"Attempt to play co-op with friends, but then have the entire experience fall apart when nobody is willing to cooperate."
24322,"Overall a good game to play with friends, with overall good cast of characters all with their own pros and con. Skills are fun and good skill tree, a bit basic but each character still diverse."
24323,"It's the only game my wife will play with me. 
Owned since release on Xbox 360."

24332,Love it!
24333,i dont get my fucking charcher!
24334,Castle Crashers is mainly about its campaign and leveling up your character the story of it makes you play it in a smart way or just all out brawl with over 10+ hours most likely able to happen while playing this i recommend it
24335,This game is AWESOME. It was worth the money.
24336,Dis game is frikin lit fam
24337,fun and good game for classes
24338,Just as fun now as it was in 2008. (Which means it's VERY fun....)
24339,fight club: 5/7 movie
24340,"I played through this game countless times on the xbox 360 way back when, so getting to play it again on a computer was nice. The humor is unique, much like the art style. There's also just something so satisfying about mowing down hordes of enemies, which is something you get to do a lot in this game. As a whole its more fun if you play with friends, but is still enjoyable if you go through the campaign solo."
24341,Great game.
24342,Lobby & controller acting up. When i got into the game it got repetitive very fast.
24343,Probably my most played game. I've played this roughly about 2-3 years and yes I know I have little hours on steam but i played this on xbox and im burnt out. Anyways its really fun i have beat the game more than 30 times and have all the characters so much fun and i really recommend for anyone to buy this. I also LOVE the artstyle and developers. Have bought all their games they have.
24344,"the game is fine but not then that , the combo are boring , the storyline is meaningless  and not needed ,the game is very short , and its impossible to play online, the only good point in the game that theres a good humor in it"
24345,still fun
24346,"I'm absolutly in love with this game and the behemoth, i greatly recommend it!"
24347,"got to beat up a dude with a meat sword while my pet bat ate his face off

24356,I played this at school rather than listening to my teachers

24358,This is a good one
24359,I have no friends :(
24360,"Nice game to play with friends, but you can also play it solo, but it will become harder because noone can revive you. It has funny story good jokes, worth the money"
24361,"This game reminds me days in high school when I played a lot Alien Hominid and both games are developped by Behemoth. Buy this game from sale and get a lot of fun with small amount money.

Pros
+ Visual expression of Castle Crashers is good and funny. 
+ Co-op (you can beat barbarians with friends)
+ Nice campaign

Cons
- I used keyboard and controls were mediocre at the best (but if you have controller it can be better)
"
24362,"This is a great CO-OP game, every time my friends come over we play this."
24363,Kill Mongols with your friends to retrieve your whores from the Grandmaster Faggot Wizard. Then kill your friends to decide who dicks the whores then kill them in real life.
24364,"EPIC! That is all i can say
"
24365,"this game is AWESOME!!! 

I love this game very much

"
24366,"This game is one of the best games on steam I have ever played. This game has great graphics, action, bits of comedy and has a great story mode."

24368,ıts good game but no body plays co-up mode
24369,good
24370,Plays like a classic beat-em-up that I really like. 8/10
24371,Awesome Game!
24372,"Ew, gross, some flash game maker got his shit published on Steam. Get it off and put it back on that one flash site where it belongs. Or better, go back in time and put it in the '00s where it belongs, flash is outdated now if you weren't aware, some browsers refuse to even use it. And so should Steam."
24373,"where is the spaghetti
"
24374,My right arrow key doesn't work
24375,hit stuff with sword
24376,its good game.
24377,"One of the best Co-Op games I have ever played.
I recommend for people who like Co-Op games, or prefer to play Beat-Em-Up games.
Not worth full price, wait till it goes on sale for $5.

Pros:
-Great to play with friends
-Wide selection of characters
-You have to work to unlock characters

Cons:
-Characters are not balanced at all
"
24378,perfect time killin game
24379,"This game is pure indie fun. :)

Very few things to learn, just click away on your enemies. Combos are easy to make and it's funny to see the gore. Controller highly recommended."
24380,crash a castle crash some more just dont get attacked by a door
24381,yes
24382,RIP JOSH
24383,"I love this game to bits. The entire art and sound design makes the combat punchy and gives it a certain 'OOMPH' that few games achieve for me. I love the sheer number of weapons, the variety in characters, the creative setpieces and villains, and of course the music is phenomenal. 

I have fond memories of waking up at 5AM in the summer so I could get onto my Dad's Xbox before my brothers so I could play this all day long. Others have had great experience playing with friends but I for one adore the solo adventure

It's just rip-roaring button mashing unrelenting hack-and-slash fun that I always come back to now and again.

If you're on the fence or need any more convincing, just get it. You won't be disappointed"
24384,"[b]PROS:[/b]
+ great brawler gameplay
+ fantastic co-op
+ tons of unlockable characters
+ tons of unlockable weapons & animals
+ level design and atmosphere
+ Behemoth humor
+ Insane mode

[b]CONS:[/b]
- rather short campaign
- sometimes weird loading of player progress in co-op

[b]Comment:[/b]
There are three modes to play - Campaign, Arena and Back Off Barbarian. The Campaign is the main source of fun, the levels are different, the challenges unique and the bosses cool. But they best way to experience this game is not solo (although you can) but through the wonderful co-op. This is where the game shines as you share your adventure with up to three buddies. After you finish the standard campaign Insane mode will unlock with all the New Game+ fun and challenge. The only thing I can point out as glitchy here is that progress updates strangely and sometimes you have to re-do a level because it won't save for your friends (or you, if you are not the server). Arena is fun competitive fighting and Back Off Barbarian is precise button pressing alone or with a friend. Each character has their own save and XP progress. You can unlock lots of character, weapons and tiny animals to help out. Fighting is responsive with options between ranged (archery, magic) and melee. Playing with keyboard is really doable but feels suboptimal. Mainly because your fingers start to hurt real quick. There are a lot of combos and tons of button mashing and a good gamepad helps with this. Behemoth humor and art-style are awesome in all of their games, Castle Crashers are no exception. This makes for a great game and one of the best co-op games currently on Steam for both casual and hardcore gamers. Don't miss out on this great experience!

24389,"Castle Crashers is a 2D beat-em-up game, and one hell of one at that.  There is a learning curve to this game for learning optimal combos, which may vary depending on the character you use.  Speaking of characters, theres 30+ available if you take the time to unlock them!  This game supports 4 player online coop, but is still fun if you only have one buddy to play with. Playing solo is ok, but I imagine wouldn't be as fun or compelling to grind for all the unlocks.

There is some crude humor, catchy music, and a difficult hard mode for those that want a serious challenge.  Honestly this game should be a staple for anyone that enjoys beat-em-up games."
24390,"Great fighting style, epic music, Funny moments. This game is absolutely perfect. To all of the unlocks to the many different types of weapons. Complete awesomeness."
24391,"This game blows. The enemies seem to be unkillable, while the combat system prettymuch consists out of jumping and spamming hoping to stagger then to death. It's not fun to hit them 5 times with your complete rotation just to kill side mobs, also there are points in the game where you get magic imune enemies. Magic was the only way to make it sorta fun, but those destroyed this aswell. The only thing it got going for itself is that the art work is amazing and there are some jokes that made us chuckles.

There are better games, this one might be playable as 4 player team, but with 2 it's pretty bad"
24392,veri ncie
24393,"GREAT GAME.

Super-fun to play in group! It has a very juvenile and kinda disgusting sense of humour but it's nice and easy to play and the drawings are so cute and nice!

If you wanna a game to play with your gang, that's a nice choice. It doesn't have a lot of story or any complexity so it's pretty easy to get it and have fun with it, no matter the interests of the rest of your group. My little cousins love it."
24394,this game is a clever mix of humor and violence the only problem is that there isn't a second one
24395,is verry good nyeas.
24396,"4 guys fighting for 3 princesses and a clown.
Would play again."
24397,"Fun, goofy and lots of replay value!
Definitely Recommended!"
24398,"Castle Crashers is an excellent beat em up four player game. It was originally made for Local Co-op but has been expanded to online now as well. Even so, I would recommend still only playing locally because the comedy is better in person then online. Pick this one up if you are looking for some mindless fun, but don't go looking for a solo run because enemies do not scale down with the party size meaning you will still face the game meant for a full party alone, which can easily be frustrating when needing to grind then steamroll the enemies."
24399,I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!! GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
24400,This was one of my favorite games and it never gets old

24409,"Actually a pretty good game, you may think it would get repetitive because of the linear storyline or the combat system but is still a lot of fun, it is an amazing game to chill with friends and have fun, even if the online coop may be a problem sometimes you can play co-op with 1pc, if i had to complain on something i would say that some characters have pretty shitty magic, still the game is good balanced because strong characters may be very powerfull when spaming the hit button, but archers are fast and difficult to catch and if you get caught in a advanced mage's spell you're dead, so at the end is just a matter of skill."
24410,This game is great for co-op and chilling in front of the TV.
24411,"Fantastic game, especially good in co-op. Very difficult, requires a miniscule amount of grinding in solo play. Lots of unlockable characters, weapons and pets, each with their own unique abilities."
24412,Three words to describe this game :fun simple and fast. The story is simple kill bad guys save the princess.
24413,I love this game!
24414,"this game is the best you can have so much fun on your own or with friends
"
24415,"this is one of the best games i ever plaued
"
24416,"This game is a joy to play. It's got a quriky and weird sense of humor that you start to enjoy, it has great gameplay, and it's a blast to play with friends. It's more of a beat em up style game but not one like the others. This game (although not impossible) isn't easy. It has a fun nature and it's just a game that brightens up your day."
24417,"A fun little platformer which isnt as 'little' as it looks. Extremely fun to play with friends, OKAY when played alone. At times the enemies are a bit overwhelming but you can go around mashing buttons and probably gonna get them at some point."
24418,"I really enjoy this game for how long i've played it. It's simple yet very fun even without a goal in mind or mission to play. Castle Crashers has a nice diversity among characters. Even crossing over with a few of their other games into this one as playable characters, I really appreciate this game's simple art style, branching away from hyper-realistic games such as the current hits like C.O.D.

That's all I have to say, but I REALLY reccommend getting this game no matter what!"
24419,"i looooove the game, i will reccomend getting an controller for this game cuz on keyboard/mouse you arent gonna get really far, trust me!"
24420,Really good gameplay and story
24421,good
24422,Super fun gameplay will get you hooked
24423,"I absolutely love this game. It's full of insanity, humour, and awesomeness. I've now played this game twice, once on Xbox 360, and again on Steam, and the second time playing was no less fun than the first. Multiplayer is perfect for this game, and I got so much more fun out of this game playing it with my friend than I would have if I were alone. We spent many hours playing this game, and will likely spend more hours on this game just for fun."
24424,This game is a meme.
24425,I played this with a friend at my school through out the whole game just the two of us and we had a blast with the great humor and art style the game has to offer. As an artiest the developers funky art style fits this game so well and I love every bit of it. Nice cheep game (in the sales) to play up to 4 friends highly rate as a generial game to play every once in a while.
24426,great game love definitley one of my top 5 fav games and it is just so action packed to keep you playing forever
24427,A good game very interesting! check it out!
24428,"Very good, i like it its fun, cool and doesn't take alot of space."

24432,"I love everything the Behemoth has made, and this game is my favorite of them. Its like an old school side scroller, like from the arcade machines (back when that was a thing lol) mixed with being cartoony, funny, and medevial. Got no complaints about this one whatsoever"
24433,"Alles good good
"
24434,good game
24435,"From personal experience, I have had many problems with the game from extreme lag in multiplayer to downright frustrating bugs in singleplayer. On top of that the game isn't really that fun, it's repetitive, not an original concept and the controls aren't the best for sure (especially if you don't have a controller). I wouldn't recommend to anyone, exept if you want something to play while you're watching a movie or show and just want to be doing something repetitive that doesn't offer any sort of challenge.

Edit: You know what, after further inspection I shall change my ruling to a 'decent'. It's certainly fun when you play with friends, but otherwise I'm going to have to say it really is repetitive. Although I haven't encountered any bugs since I re-downloaded so that's obviously a huge plus, so if you have friends to play with you, go for it (but do definitely wait for a sale!)."
24436,LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOV THIS GAME
24437,"Great beat-em-up game with good replay value, highly enjoyable with friends and developed by one of the coolest dev teams ever. Easy to recommend seeing as it goes on sale often, and when there's a free demo to try out first :)

Love this game, bought it on switch too."

There once was a game that I played
Castle Crashers was what it was named
I lasted 25 minutes
This game pushed me to my limits
And now I have gone insane

It was not a very good thought
To mix herion while smoking pot
I played this game high
Please do not ask why
That night shall not be forgot

I thought it all was a dream
Killing that hooker was my nasty scheme
I killed her with no fail
Now I am in jail
Anyways play Castle Crashers on Steam"

24517,game good
24518,"Its very fun to play when me and my friends get bored and tilted at other games like League of Legends
"
24519,I think this is a very good game mostly for the fact that you can play with your friends compete and yell at them for stealing your gold. This is a game where you progress from stage to stage hacking in slashing in a 2d adventure. I recomend getting it during a steam sale when its 3 bucks instead of 15. If your looking for a deep storyline then you might like this game as much but the fighting mechanics and the jokes that dont need any words are just to good. SO grab a friend and fight some nubs
24520,GOD GAME
24521,my castle has been thoroughly crashed
24522,HELL YEAHHHH
24523,"A very fun game that is harder than what it seems. Definitely a lot harder alone than with others, but still doable. The leveling system is good since you can choose different stats to make more powerful, which can drastically affect your gameplay. Also, choosing the best weapon and animal orb for what you are trying to do adds in a bit of strategy into this otherwise chaotic game. Expert mode is where it gets actually insane.

The story starts off easy enough to follow: battle the enemies and save the princesses (and magic crystal?). However, after beating the cyclops in the volcano area, it feels like the story just goes off the rails and the writers might have just went mad, doing whatever they wanted.

The collectables are fun to try to get. It's nice to unlock all of the animal orbs and weapons, and it's fun to unlock a few of the other characters. However, you REALLY need to grind for a long time to be able to unlock all of the characters since you need to beat the game several times with essentially everyone.

Overall, very fun beat-em-up style game that is especially fun with friends. Also, the story isn't a huge deal, so that was kind of me just nitpicking."
24524,"Sometimes you just want to hack things to pieces. 
This is one of those games where it feels satisfying, and fun! 
"
24525,"[h1]Should you buy Castle Crashers®?[/h1]

Yes, you should buy it! If you like knights, quests, and funny moments, this game is for you! I personally think this is a great game esspecially if you have family that enjoys playing games together. This is also fun if you like playing with friends. It has a funny aspect to the game that will make you laugh. It's rewarding every time you get past a level and beat the boss. This game does have a nostalgic feeling to it. Castle Crashers is just an overall great game. Play it!

Pros:
-No really excessively long cutscenes
-Fun gameplay
-Great characters
-Very balanced enemies
-Very challenging hardcore mode
-Not really any bugs

Cons:
-You cannot play on mac with a controller (this is a huge annoyance to many, and especcialy me. I almost clicked ""No"" for reccomandation because of this.) and the devs do not mention this anywhere
-Keyboard controls are a$$ (base movement keys are arrow keys)
-Extremely difficult to play if you don't have friends

Conclusion:
Good game, but not worth $15. I'd say more around $10, especcialy for mac users."

24543,Good
24544,"Fun gameplay inspired by classic side scrolling beat em ups. There are a variety of characters to choose from, various weapons with different stats, leveling up and choosing what to focus on, magic, items. It's really fun, especially with a friend. It's got a sense of humor and good game play. Interesting boss battles, and a wide variety of levels. My one and only complaint is a complaint I tend to have with all 2D side scrolling beat em ups, is that it can be hard to tell where to hit. If you're standing slightly in front of the enemy, or behind, you miss, and it can be tough to judge. Maybe I just suck though?"
24545,Awesome game!
24546,A great time killer i would highly recommend i have had no problems with this game its challenging and so addictive. the campaign is good and the bosses are cool. this game has some serious and funny moments and great visuals get this game!

+ Great visual style and creative presentation.

+ An absolute treasure of a co-op/multiplayer title. The game shines when playing with friends, but is quite enjoyable even if playing alone.

- Combat is admittedly simplistic in nature, and more combos would have done a lot to spice the raw gameplay value of this title.
- [spoiler]Choosing to play as certain characters can render one helpless in a playthrough if playing solo.[/spoiler]

24563,Great game 10/10 if a little grindy
24564,"For a 2D side scrolling brawler it has lots to offer. Lots of characters, weapons, and animals to choose from. For how cheap it is and how cheap it gets on sale, its really worth buying at full price to support them! Plus online multiplayer? Now this I can get into!"
24565,"i swear i forgot when i got this game

yet i have fun

a lot"
24566,Need friends... Damn it i am alone
24567,great game. wont ever get old.
24568,Good game. But in my opinion over priced
24569,"This is an amazing game no matter on what platform you play this in. Wether you tackle this solo or gather up a bunch of friends and conquer the land you will have tons of fun. My favorite part are the pets with their passive skills that assist you throughout the game. If you have not played this yet I recommend you give this a try, be it magic or melee, go onwards and have fun."
24570,"I love this game and it's fun alone, or with friends. The only complaint I have is that if you're playing this game over the internet, it can be laggy at times."
24571,"How to play this game:

GET GIRLFRIEND/BOYFRIEND AND PLAY IT WITH THEM."
24572,great! (y)
24573,"Outstanding game to play with friends. I played solo, due to my lack of friends, but STILL thouroughly enjoyed every second of this beautiful game. 10/10"
24574,"Game's fantastic. easy to learn and has good humour. it can be a little repetitive, but it's still really good and I highly recommend you get it."
24575,i dont like the game is wierd
24576,"A good title from the developers at Newgrounds, Castle Crashers is a game that I wholeheartedly reccomend. It's easy to pick up and the humor is so good. The game does get repetitive after a while, but nevertheless I feel this game deserves a lot of praise."
24577,Fantastic and Funny...
24578,very good
24579,"Well. This was definetly an experience... Castle Crashers is a good game. It's so amazing that this was just made by a few people on Newgrounds, and now it's practically a cultural phenominon. So, the artwork. It's good and has a style that suprises you when it breaks away from it, but it does so for the right reasons. The music. I don't remember much of it other than the menu theme and the shop theme, but it was good. Now, the gameplay. This one was great, as you had an improved moveset as you leveled up, with the melee and magic attacks. You feel quick, you have a ton of weapons to choose from, and you just look plain cool. However, some things can be quite hard in the game, that had me stuck for a very long time. The most known one is probably the Volley Ball game. I finished my first play through of the game alone, so I had to play for three other people. This took about ten attempts, and the only way I can think of to let you win is to smack your oponents on the other side of the court. Then we have some of the enemies. This is only really a problem in the arenas or the second to last boss fight, but some of them are really annoying. Such as the thieves, who shoot arrows so much that it's nearly impossible to actually get a hit on them without getting hit back. Then we get to (I'm just gonna call him what Weegee Plays called him) Dark Steel Wing... As a fighter himself, he stinks. But when you have two waves of every single enemie in the game, that's where it gets rough. Also the final boss is hard, but that should be expected, as it is the final boss, with like six fases. The best part of the game in my opinion though is how just about every standard enemy in the game is a playable character. The only exceptions are huge bosses and the fish people. Overall, good game, and even better with friends!"
24580,"Good game, great with friends"
24581,"In classic Beat-Em'-Up style Castle Crashers is an excellent game. I have spent hours playing this game with my friends and made wonderful memories. Easy controls, Controller support, Beautiful art style, and wonderful gameplay all contribute to my recomendation of this game. Well worth the $15 and even more with a few friends"
24582,Really good game i already have over 100!! hours real fun
24583,"This is a fun game to play by yourself and an even more fun with friends. This game has a ton of characters to play and a bunch of differences between the characters. There are a ton of weapons and different ways to play the game. The dialogue in this game is funny as well. This game is fun game with or without your friends. I recommend it to anyone.

10/10 :)"
24584,Full of fun beat 'em up game
24585,YES
24586,"Experiencing game-breaking bug where it was impossible to do damage on an end-stage. Boring, repetitive combat."
24587,a bit too easy but fun
24588,This is a great game that has replayability and great multiplayer.
24589,"cool.

24591,"10/10
just a one of few game that can make me laugh

"
24592,"Very fun and adictive game. It is, however better with friends but still a ton of fun playing alone as well."
24593,"Fun game, but after one playthrough it gets kinda boring, even though there is a more difficult mode. Most enjoyable when playing it with friends."
24594,"This is a really fun game to play in multiplayer 10/10.

BUTT, when you play single player, welcome to cartoon DARKSOULS."
24595,This game is great!!!  *mutters*I play alone*
24596,what
24597,"An amazing game wherever you look at it, awesome soundtrack, crazy history, simple controls with any type of headache and it even have a cooperative to play with your friends."
24598,"With the exception of that one vollyball level and that damn dsylexic's nightmare game, I think this is a pretty swell game. Especially if playing with friends over discord. But then again everything is better with friends. ~generic positive review 2017"
24599,"Great game, definitely worth the money. The only thing I would suggest is to be able to continue the campaign you already played with a different character"
24600,Good Game until i realize the community is crap
24601,Great game to play with someone else.  It's very accesible to non-gamers.
24602,"[b]Titles made by [i]The Behometh[/i] typically split people into two distinct groups - those that *love* them, and those that don't.[/b] I appreciate the unique humor and artwork, but it's just not my cup of tea. I find the gameplay beneath the hood is paper thin and really nothing fresh (save for [i]Pit People[/i]). [i]Castle Crashers[/i] is no exception. 

[i]Essentially, this title is a run-of-the-mill beat'em up.[/i] You've played this a million times before, just in a different skin. For me, these titles are fun with friends for about an hour, but then they are too repetitive. I'd rather just go for something more complex such as [i]Grim Dawn[/i]. The grind is still in your face, but there is much  more depth and customization.

[b]Pros:[/b]
+High level of polish
+Controller support is great
+Fun with friends
+Definitely a quirky art- and humor-style that I appreciate (but I don't particularly like it)

[b]Cons:[/b]
+Game mechanic is beat
+Paper thin complexity that makes this a chore in sessions more than, oh I don't know, about an hour
+Price point is a bit high

[b]I know there is a [i]hugggee[/i] fan base for [i]The Behometh[/i] games - I get that, I really do.[/b] Unfortunately, for me the humor and art is not enough to carry it."
24603,"A simple yet entertaining game. It's fun to play with friends. Also, if you are about to buy this please make sure you have a gamepad, else it's really hard to control."
24604,"Loved it in coop shared screen mode. Very funny at times and great fun. The combat system is great and simple enough to pick with little practice. Great gameplay, varied bright colourful and beautiful 2D graphics and great sound. A must buy if youre looking for couch coop"
24605,"fun little side scroller.

better with friends than solo"
24606,Fun as HEll
24607,this is a good game
24608,I have only played about an hour to 2 hours but it's already an amazing game
24609,good shit!
24610,"Great game to play with friends OR on your own. It can get quite tedious at times, though."

24618,Perfect game! I wanted this game since probably 2011 and last year I got it. This is one of the best games i own now and I enjoy playing it!
24619,Nope.
24620,Love the art style. Funi gaem
24621,it is amazing
24622,I love the games humor and the artistic value of the game. I also enjoy the the quest for the orange princess..........NO SPOILERS :)
24623,"Best game!
I love it!
I recommend it if you have someone to play with."
24624,This is an extremely fun game. Especially if you play with your friends. With silly jokes and an art that matches this type of mood Castle Crashers becomes a challenging and funny time pass. i really recomend to play it on multiplayer!
24625,Fun game with nobody playing it.
24626,"-Great gameplay
-Great humor
-Great replayability
-Great with friends

This game is fantastic to play with friends and unlocking characters, animal orbs, weapons, and abilities will always make you come back for more. Been playing on and off since 2009 (on my 360) and it's still a fun game to play. Worth a buy even at full price."
24627,I like the POWWERRR!!!
24628,It's pretty cwazy
24629,This game is exrtemely fun when with friends and no try-harding
24630,"Though most of my experience with this game is from the Xbox, i do think it is one of THE BEST 2D beatemup games ever. It never gets old; its funny, and the replayability is just so plentiful."
24631,"As a absolutely smashing addition to my Behemoth library, Castle Crashers is a hell of a great side scrolling beat-em-up, With a hilarious plot, and a ton of random and goofy easter eggs, it is perfect for those times where you need a good game to play with friends. I recomend an controller of some sort to play this with, because the magic in this game are hard to cast with a keyboard. My only complaint on gameplay would be about the weird 2D/3D aspect that this game tries to give, because it is somewhat disoriented, like you can think that you're hitting a boss from behind but you're actually not.
Overall, 9.5/10, absolutely recommended."
24632,"Quite an beat em up adventure, it contains many characters, but some feel alot stronger than the other ones, on top of that it has extremely little replayability once the learning curve has been mastered. Definitely shouldn't be missed out on if you want a fun cozy 4 player experience, otherwise it's not that worthy to be played.

The multiplayer experience is essential to enjoying this game."
24633,"It's pretty fun, and it's not laggy, so anyone on any computer can run it."
24634,"This game is amazing.  Good gameplay and replayability, great humor, and very fun co-op story.  10/10 would buy again."
24635,good game
24636,77 minutes in. Goddamn i don't regret speding my money for a sec.
24637,"A verry good game
"
24638,fun
24639,"Super fun, if you can afford it and your friends too, do it, give it a try, you will not be disappointed."
24640,better than roblox now
24641,"This game can make u going for hrs but gets boring after finishing the story.
10/10
Great game!
Worth the price!"
24642,"At first you don't like it. Then, it slowly grows on you. As you play it more and more, it slowly creeps up on you. Bosses are fantastic, game is short but long in your mind. Could finish in one session if only playing one character. Truly a magnificent game. <3"
24643,"What i like about this game is that its kinda of an easy game, but it can be hard at some points, but its just a fun game either with friends, or just by yourself. I would recommend that you should have a friend or 2 with you on this game, because it will be hard at some of the time, but it just makes it more fun with friends."
24644,"An extremly good game and fun to play with friends and it get easier and easier from playing 1 player to 4 players
It needs some work in the multiplayer part becasue if one person of the 4 is lagging all 4 will lag
But otherwise Its still a good game"
24645,"Add me for Castle Crashers, just got it, but ive played it on Ps3 a while back, will be on alot."
24646,"I usually never write reviews, this is probably the first one I really felt like writing down. Why? Well, simply because this game deserves it. 

Animations are smooth and will work on basically any pc, the way they portrait characters and weapons is very good, lots of them look funny (see lobster weapon) or just really cute and adorable (pet orbs, d'aww.). 
Storyline is fun and addictive, lots of variety in the enemies and how to approach them, lots of characters to play and unlock, with loads of secret weapons/orbs hidden all around. I started playing it again with my girlfriend few days ago, and I played around 20 hours in the last 3-4 days alone. 

If you're looking for a realistic game, or one with badass graphics, this is not the game for you. If you want a game you can spend days in, playing with friends (or gf), with lots of different approaches, lots of stuff to discover and funny moments, you're in the right place. This is a fun game, and that's what matters most, in my opinion.
4.5 years old and still the best 2D hack and slash you can find around."
24647,"Once being my favourite game, it is an amazing work by The Behemoth. I loved playing through it on my long car trip from the West Coast to the East Coast. Amazing and now nolstalgic music. Overall fantastic."
24648,"I Haven't Played Skyrim In A While, But I Don't Remember It Looking This Weird."
24649,Definitely a recent classic that continues to age well. Best enjoyed when played with friends.
24650,yay

24653,"You get to hit people and do some wicked combos.

I'd say this is pretty good."
24654,"Great game, fun, perfect for parties, Insane Mode is very challenging. Lots of different bosses and places, game is pretty short but it's not boring. Unlocking things take some time which is also a good side of the game. It's pretty expensive (especially with all DLCs) but it's worth those money."
24655,fun if only had friends ;(((((( rip would play alone again
24656,"Old school Beat'em Up style game for up to 4 Players.

You're going to love this :D It's like you got a Nintendo Wii and party games, but but instead of expensive its cheap and totally fun! :D The developers are making awesome games for years :D"
24657,Defintely Recommend buying this Behemoth Classic 10/10
24658,"Juicy adventure that takes the ""knight saving the princess in a castle"" concept
to a new creative level with unique and captivating enemies and bosses
Although it gets repetitive at a certain amount of time, it's still
extremely fun to play with your friends!"
24659,Awesome Game rate it 10/10

I love this game still and will for ever do so"

24662,"This game is awesome, i used to play this with some friends in the past and kept playing since them with every new friend that came home here... its very funny and very well made."
24663,good
24664,Slash'em Dash'em
24665,"Excellent for groups of friends with mixed taste in games. Most of my coworkers game and almost all of my friends do, and this is the only one that we can usually agree to Co-Op. Whatever your preferences are be it PC, Mac, or Console, Shooters or sandbox, action or adventure, Castle Crashers is a unifier between the heated debates of the gaming world.
Yes, on paper it's just another simple side-scrolling hack and slash, but somehow it still stands out as unique. 
I never play this game alone, so buy the four pack and gift the rest to your buddies. For me, that move led to hours of laughter and competition between friends and aquaitances who would otherwise be playing something else with online strangers."
24666,"This is a fun 4-player RPG, with a lot of cool references, funny jokes, and exciting battles. If you've played Battleblock Theater and enjoyed it, then this is a must.  If you can pick it up on sale, especially the 4-pack, you'll have a great time."
24667,the best sidescroller to ever exist
24668,Funtastic!
24669," Castle Crashers is a 2D Hack n Slash/ Brawler game which in my opinion worked perfectly on so many levels. The story is quite simple: You and other four knights chase through various levels a mysterious villain who just snatched an equally mysterious crystal and four fair maidens from your castle. 
If you're looking for dramatic, story-rich content this is not the game for you. BUT if you're keeping an eye out for a fun filled, challenging multiplayer game then definitely yes.

The controls are quite simple, I easily managed to play more than 30 hours of the game on just my keyboard. Though if you want to make life a bit easier for yourself then I would suggest a controller. It's a game where timing and cooperation with other players is essential.

What really got me into the game was the Unique Art style. The Game Artist, Dan Paladin, made an excellent job in creating a cartoonish, colourful (and in many ways cute) world. Even the monsters look pretty. The game is rich with humour and the Style conveys that perfectly.
Excellent graphics combined with an Epic soundtrack make this game entertaining and glorious for both eyes and ears.

The game can work for both Solo players and Co-op Players, though I would really suggest it for the latter. This is the kind of game you want to laugh about and yell to when you're with friends. It's a great experience, better shared with someone that likes the game's... shall we say... extreme humour.

In order to not make the game repetitive and eventually boring, the game developers made an excellent job in adding ways to enhance your character and give you different abilities to choose from. There are many ways to fight the hordes of enemies in each level, and it's so rewarding to see your character progress and become a bad-ass by the end of it. And if that wasn't enough, there are 28 animal spirit that you can acquire throughout the game. Not only they're adorable, they're also useful for boosting your character's stats.

In conclusion, this is definitely the one I can suggest to everyone, regardless of age. 
Though it might look simple, it's a well made, challenging game. And no matter what, you will want to play it over and over again."

This is an awasome game that I could play! Cute animations! Nice history-And u can play it with friends! :D"
24673,"A great old school beat-em-up with some light rpg elements that makes trying new characters, stats, weapons, and pets fun to mess around with.

Colorful hand drawn graphics.

Great bosses with tons of personality, and lots of them.

Lots of secrets and collectibles to unlock.

You do need a controller. 

Make sure to check out insane mode!"

Quick warning: They recommend a controller.  Playable with keyboard, but it takes a bit of getting used to.
Second quick warning: This game made me crave PB&J sandwiches.  I did not get super buff after eating, though.

((If you don't already have it, get Battleblock Theater, too.  So you too can break stuff as Hatty.))"

24726,i played as the healer character against my friends but they got annoyed so none of us ever played the game again
24727,I'm not recommending it because i don't want my friends to have as much fun as i do while playing this game. #420Blazeit
24728,"I played this game 500 hours on the ps3 beat it like 5 times on harder difficulty.
However I wont be doing that over again.... too much of this game is crazy"
24729,Original and super fun !
24730,"This game made me question my friendships specifically one with a banana, when he stole my giraffe"
24731,"10/10

Let me preface this by saying that this isn't my first copy of Castle Crashers. I owned it back when I played Xbox as a kiddie, now that I'm a big boy I bought it on PC. This review really isn't about the base, single player side of game. The game itself is amazing. I feel like that doesn’t need to be said, as it's been said a million times already.

I'm recommending this if you have a s/o that isn't super familiar with video games, but you want to play something with them. I’m basing this review off of my experiences with my Fiancé, who has played a few games in the past (Mario, Donkey Kong, etc.). Simply put, she’s not super familiar with modern video games. The easy controls are what drives it home the most when it comes to being an introductory video game. I tried to play Portal 2 with her, but that was a little too advanced. On top of that, multiplayer isn't just local co-op, you can connect online and play that way. It's great to revisit the game with her after all these years. It says a lot about a Castle Crashers to have the same level of enjoyment, if not more, than the first time beating the game."
24732,"A must have game.!
Fun, fun and more fun."
24733,"THE FUCKING BEST GAME, i recommend buying it because the pirate version is very shitty and you also  help the creators"
24734,good game
24735,"I love this game! 
I've had this game for some years now, and I think it deserves to be recommended. 
"
24736,"Overall, I think this is a pretty good game, It's got a good story line, parts that are funny (like the part with the shitting deer or the shitting owl)

And with multiplayer it's even better, not only can you fight monsters and complete the game together, but you can also duel each other when you rescue a princess or go in an arena, which from my view is really fun and adds more to what the game is."
24737,Great game but after awhile can get a little repetitve Should get Medal because I need a badge
24738,"Great game, funny graphics thanks to Dan Paladin.
Fun Fact: Tom Fulp, the founder of The Behemoth, also founded Newgrounds"
24739,great game 10/10
24740,fun
24741,Its awesome
24742,One of those games where I wish Steam would allow for a neutral recommendation status. It's nice because there's 4 player co-op (local and online) but the game itself isn't really much good.
24743,cute
24744,"Beat 'em up as the Knights of Ye Olde Badassery Yore. Your babes were kidnapped! GET 'EM BACK, YO. Oh, and also some evil guy stole your king's crystal, or something.

Pretty fun game, worth playing with friends more though."
24745,"Good game if you have potato computers or laptops; runs very fast and smooth.

Has:

-Good and funny graphics
-Unique levels, each with a new gimick or enemy.
-Various weapons, each with their own ups, downs and effects.
-Cute and helpful Animal Orbs, some are easy to get, some are hard.
-A helpful wiki.
-Various characters you can play as, each with their own unique appearance and magic."
24746,Its a funny and fun game just buy it i dont remember how much it was but its worth it.
24747,"I got this game from a friend originally cause he really wanted to play it with someone. I played for a bit then just kinda stopped for a while. 

Coming back to this game, I can always have a chuckle and have fun while playing the game. It nails really everything great and is really fun overall. Would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun couch-coop/multiplayer game."
24748,"Really fun, but unfortunately it has 0 replayability value."
24749,Best game to play with friends--a classic that I will always come back to
24750,"So Much Fun just destroying Enemies
"
24751,"A humorous and entertaining game, singleplayer is good fun but the co-op enhances it so much. There are lots of easter eggs and items to unlock and when your character becomes a hardcore veteran, you can start a new character or go on hard mode. I've enjoyed all my time on this game and I reckon you would too if you like the tags!"
24752,good if u want to rape 4 princesses that got rapenapped by giants.
24753,This game is only fun if you don't have fun.
24754,"good gameplay, good story, different  character playable, cute character(not in rage mode), cute animal, cute enemy"
24755,hi
24756,"This game is amazing one thing is that, I wish there was more to do when you beat the game but lovely game."
24757,I love this Game it Gave me hours of entainment
24758,Cool game to play with friends
24759,"You will enjoy this. 
"
24760,"Great gift, fun to play w friends 7/10"
24761,"Good Game overall!
Could us a bit more different levels.  
I finished the game in two weeks.
Fun with friends"
24762,"Gather your friends, grab controllers (yeah you need controllers to trigger that childrish excitement from the inside, seriously lol) and enjoy the game.
Castle crashers has amazing humor, pretty successive on the artwork and animations side, also a reaallyy reallly good beat em up game.
Get it whenever you can if you haven't already!"
24763,"This is a great game to pick up and play with friends.  The wide selection of chracters that you can choose with their certain kinds of magic and you can build them all different ways is a nice breath of fresh air, but the game has two serious flaws off the top of my head that I should point out that people should be aware of if they're going to buy this.

1.  Online multiplayer always seems to have some sort of lag; it can be varying from slight hiccups to completely unbearable.  Just keep that in mind when playing with friends.
2.  At the beginning when loading up Castle Crashers it says that a ""controller is recommended.""  I CANT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!  The keyboard controls for this game are horrible and I've re-mapped them several times and it just doesn't feel as good as when you play with a controller.  Please make sure to have some sort of gamepad before you buy this game unless you can deal with re-mapping buttons to subpar locations.

All-in-all though such a great game.  I put lots of hours in it and had lots of fun playing it.  I definitely recommend it and if you haven't played Castle Crashers before and you're kinda iffy on if you'll like it just search it on youtube, look at other owner's reviews and you'll see it's a pretty good pick."
24764,"I love it's funny style and interestin' story.Very suit for play with friends especially gf.But actually i m still single Ծ‸Ծ.So if you want to play with me or wanna to be my girlfriend,just add me to your friend list."
24765,Its pretty fun when ypu play it with friends
24766,Castle Crashers is a fun game with great gameplay and fair mechanics. All I can really say that is bad is that some levels you can't beat first time without going to earlier one and leveling up but still I really don't care because it is still fun no matter what to knock the crap out of some guys.
24767,"Amazing, this game is almost 10 years and is still fun!"
24768,is good
24769,"One of my favourite games, ultimate favourite games."
24770,godlike. that is all
24771,You crash castles.
24772,"""Its a great game, but not to behemoth standard.""

24773,"Greatest ""have some friends over"" experience!"
24774,could be fun but it gets old
24775,"Hilariously entertaining to plane alone, or with friends. Several Classes, and weapons to choose from and upgrade. I feel like it plays pretty quickly, and I really with there was more contect being released. Definately worth whatever they're asking now days :)"
24776,"Fun to play with your significant other. Easy to pick-up, but difficult to master. The art style is refreshing, plays well on low-spec 2009 Intel Celeron laptops at 60 FPS, looks gorgeous, and on higher end PCs there is ultra texture quality. There are no words to convey story, but rather simply punny art that is safe for children and adults and is guaranteed to make you laugh. With this many positive reviews, it's definitely an instant pick-up. If you can, grab a controller to avoid possible hand cramps."
24777,"One of the best beat-em-ups of all time. Looks amazing, animation is fantastic, plays smooth, tons of loot and items to find with an addictive leveling up system and TONS of playable characters. 

And the music. The flippin' music is perfection.

I played this for hundreds of hours back in the old XBLA days, and remember every song, stage and boss. This game is a masterpiece."
24778,high quality. I would totaly recomend this game
24779,Very good
24780,"I got this game from my friend, AND IT IS AMAZING.

10/10 Best game made by The Behemoth


(btw i did pay my friend back for your information)"
24781,"It isn't too hard for me to like a co-op game. Just give us lots of ways to smash and destroy enemies, and toss in some basic looting and/or leveling or something else that gives the impression of progress. Castle Crashers looked like exactly the kind of dumb-but-fun co-op game that my wife and I SHOULD have enjoyed. And we kinda did, for a few hours, but the enthusiasm wore off a little too quickly. All of the basic elements (humor, combat, character custmoization, level progress, graphic style) were just a little below par. Got it on sale and I still can't really say I got my money's worth; maybe I've played a few too many free games that gave me more."
24782,nice
24783,"(Played the crap out of this on console.)

Great side-scrolling beat-em-up-slash-Gauntlet hybrid.

It's a Behemoth game, the one that put them on the map, and if you're still reading down reviews this far to make your decision, let me make it for you--

Buy this game, and everything else Behemoth has made!"
24784,I am have no friends  and  con were playing a game of the year of the most important thing is that the new year to year old and new Zealand the fuck is he saying that you can find out more information on the phone number of years ago and have the same time the day of work to do with your own home and Garden Inn at least one of the grist cell phone.
24785,"Ok, so i know this game is old, and trying to find a game online is IMPOSSIBLE without spending 20 minutes sorting it out with someone in forums, but if you got a couple controllers lying around, a few buddies, and an 8 pack of Coke, this game will give you some GLORIUS nights with your mates.
Castle crashers, has the PERFECT balance between competitive play, and co-operative play- with amazing smooth gameplay to go with it. I havent spent as much time on the steam version as i have the xbox edition, but plugging in a controller makes this game just as good. Even the grind of getting all 25 characters to leve 50 isin't thst bad. 
Seriously, if you want 40-50 hours of pure, beautiful beat-em-ups, PURCHASE THIS GAME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."
24786,"It's a really fun game if you like the role-playing genre and the humour priceless...

It gets better if you play with a friend"
24787,"Its Behemoth


69/420"
24788,"A great multiplayer beat-em-up, very hilarious and lots of depth in the game. Although the plotline is rather short, the large amount of characters more than makes up for that. I spent over 30 hours playing it after I bought it and am still playing it. A definite must have for your game collection. :)"
24789,"It is a very enjoyable game, it does require more skill than just button mashing and learning new combos is very fun, although this would be better with friends. A great game to pass the time and realize you have school in just a few hours."
24790,"I need help I cant play the game because I was trying to august the screen but It truder black and says out of range if someone knows how to fix this plz tell me.
"
24791,"Fun game to play with friends and not take too seriously



This is not a fun game to play alone, so get some friends, then get this game"
24792,this is an amazing game by the behemoth and i think it should get more attention because its such a good game and i think even if you dont like it try to play it for a little bit and see how fun it is and one messege from the behemoth is saying (we can't really work on Castle Crashers 2 because we have a small team and we have to think a lot about the next project and not do 50 games at once.)
24793,"This game is brilliant. I love it, and i would highly recommend it. It delivers in every way. Also remember to checkout other stuff done by the Behemoth studio, love their work."
24794,Awesome!

"
24796,"WOW, one of the best party game i ever player"
24797,"There is nobody to play

Dead game"
24798,"This is a fun and funny game I am sure everyone will like, and are any of Behemoths other games not on steam going to be soon and why?"
24799,"Full on banter game with friends 
"
24800,you guys suck i had the game and now it tells me i have to buy it.
24801,This game is very fun and addicting. I think its a little overpriced but is still a good buy.
24802,"Simple, not too long of a game. It is really enjoyable when you're playing it for the first time. After beating the game a couple times it just starts to get boring. Hmm, you ask, 'Sure can you not just play multiplayer?' Answer is - nope. If you try to match up with someone on Castle Crashers, It just wont happen. The only fun part is playing with friends :/ and please add some updates. 



8.8/10 Game  (dead game though)"
24803,"6/10
Wish they'd made a more enjoyable exp system and overall better gameplay instead of the same characters painted a different color.

"
24804,"This game is awesome, feels like a true classic, because it is, cute, funny, brutal and a true eye candy.

A beat ‘em up with a touch of RPG is a good combination here, the artwork is amazing, the boss fights are amazing, the humor is great and the length is good, with a groovy and catchy music that is so fitting to the game (obviously this game understands that great music help immensely to make a great game), multiple characters, high replay value, and so on, it’s hard to keep a track of all the great things that this game does right, but trust me the list goes on and on.

I wouldn’t say there are no minor cons because there are, for example you can’t compare your previous weapon with your current one, you have to keep cycling between both to compare, it’s insufficient, also you can’t carry more than one weapon, and each character have only one magic type so it might get repetitive occasionally.

All in all this game is deserving, it took me 10 hours to beat this game, 4 of which was grinding to level up my character, I give this game at least a very good 8 out of 10. 

"
24805,is gut

24807,fun little game to play with friends !
24808,"[h1]Castle Mashers [/h1] 
TL;DR 
Castle crashers is an adorable side scrolling beat em up, with cute characters and colorful environments. Castle Crashers has the common story of rescue the princess(es) from the villain that taunts you through your journey. A button mashers dream of a game nice visuals a decent soundtrack and a wide variety of character skins. There are many secrets to find and many characters to unlock, it’s a visually funny game and is very replay worthy. If you don’t want to go through the entire story with friends, there is a whole section of minigames you can play to score points and compete against friends.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[h1] Gameplay[/h1]
The gameplay of castle crashers is very simple and gets repetitive pretty fast but while it lasts you can choose to focus on magic, speed or strength, each focus on which but you will be mashing your arrows, spells or just regular weapons. There are many characters to unlock and require specific challenges to be complete, which makes this game quite fun for those that like mass collection games. The is a very odd difficulty spike in some levels especially the ice area so it will grab your attention back in the later stages. The boss fights are quite nice and varied, 

[h1] Story[/h1]
The story is the classic charming story with princesses that need recuing form there kidnappers, castle crashers throws funny twists and turns throughout the adventure, you come across varied lands form forests full of bandits to flying castles cursed with magic. Behemoth have done a great job creating a light and very funny tone with tones of parodies.


[h1] Art/Graphics [/h1]
Dan Paladins art style is a staple in the Behemoths games and I love it so much, everything looks cute and charming while being bouncy and simple, nothing seems static and the environments are beautiful and memorable and the characters while all very similar gameplay wise have unique designs.

10/10 would be brutally stabbed in the back by my friends again."
24813,i love this game so much but need friends to play online with. have 1 friend on here but he doesnt own CC
24814,"I've already beaten this game on the PS3 and am enjoying it a second time on PC. Highly recommended for a great co-op game and just general insane fun. There's a lot of things to collect and many characters to level up which will leave you busy for hours. Goofy storyline as well.

Pros:
 - A lot of characters to play as and level up
 - Many different weapons and ""pets"" to collect
 - I'm playing the entire game again
 - Funny
 - Fun to play co-op

Cons:
 - It makes my hand/wrist hurt"
24815,"such a classic game with adictive gameplay. love the storyline  definetly worth your buy.  



the last cutscene with the princess is amazing"
24816,wow i love it cuz i kill everyone and i mean only some because it is hard finished with 1 character i think
24817,"Do you like adventure? Do you like slicing people's heads off. Do you like crazy and insane battles? Do you like fighting with others? Do you like magic? Do you like competition? If so then this is the game for you!

Pros:
(1.) Really fun game for either gaming alone or gaming with others. 
(2.) Great in game visuals. 
(3.) This game is worth the price when it is on sale (Imo). 
(4.) This game comes with 3 game modes: Storymode, Areana mode, and Back-Off Barbarian mode. 
(5.) This game becomes competitive when you play with others throughout the game. You compete for experience (leveling up the fasted), most enemy kills, who gets the princess, money, and the number of areana wins. 
(6.)This game is fun when played with others or if you want to play it solo. 
(7.) If your into DLC then you may like the DLC is this game. The DLC is this game is cheap ($0.99 for 1 new playable character and 5 new weapons). 
(8.) This game has online multiplayer so if you have friends on Steam and you want to play together you can. 
(9.) Steam saves your data. Your data can be used on other computers.

Cons:
(1.) Nothing. I have not experienced anything negative with this game. :)

Information:
(1.) If you simply did not find this game fun or did not like the game, you can get a refund. Check Steam refund policies here: http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/
(2.) Before you buy the game, check your computer specs to make sure it can even run the game.

Overall great and fun game and would recommend someone this game."

24820,Nice
24821,"A Glorios Game you hace here.
I think the minigames have a little bit alone because in Multiplayer you will not found people playing it.
But focusing the center game, IS FANTASTIC, with or without friends is Marvelous the game.
So i Reccomen to buy this product you will not regreted"
24822,very nice game
24823,"I love it... a game old school type with something new and really good, just Test it"

24828,"i will make it short , is it worth it ?
[b]Of Course[/b], You can't go wrong with this game. [spoiler]( there is a Pooping Deer )[/spoiler]"
24829,"It's fun with friends, but gets a bit boring if you play it alone"
24830,"If you're gonna play this game, PLAY IT WITH FRIENDS. The 4-player co-op campaign is excellent and the whole game is just a display of magnificent art, humour, and great gameplay.

At the end of the game you will be able to tell the story to your children of how you beat a giant shark cat, an anthropomorphised burnt coconut candy and pirate narutos.  10/10."
24831,"Top notch m8 haha!

24834,"Awesome and great with friends
"
24835,"I played this game about 5 years ago on Xbox 360 and I loved it, so I decided to pick it up again once I got my computer. Now I've been playing this more than I did on Xbox, there are so many character with different abilites so it's a different experience everytime you play it. This is easily one of my most favorite games, and I definitely would recommend buying it."
24836,I only recommend this if you play with people or friends because if you're playing this game by yourself this game will kick your ass
24837,"i buy this game for 2€

24845,Party hard with a party of 4. Story is confusing but who cares. It is Tom Fulp.
24846,:)
24847,Great game!
24848,Fun for the whole family
24849,"This game is stupid levels of fun. Kill bad guys and make out with princesses. Bought a 4 pack during a summer sale and so glad I did. If I see another deal like that I'm snagging it. It was awesome having extra copies to give to friends and play with them, so worth it. I'd do a 4 pack of the DLC, too, if it's available next time."
24850,"Great game, worth it if you have friends :^)"
24851,very good to play with your friends instead of jerking off
24852,Is very good best game in 2D for many time
24853,its replayable
24854,One of my first steam games. Very casual hack and slash to enjoy with friends.
24855,"Always respect the classics!!!

This is a fun 2D side scroller hack and slash RPG.

There is no way you can go wrong with this game. 

10/10 would buy again."
24856,Ive played more hours than I can count of this game back on my old xbox 360 and it is just so fun. If you enjoy a grind but don't want to be bored than this game is for you.
24857,"Cant really fault it

8/10"
24858,"An absolute classic!

Excellent side scrolling hack and slash! HAs a real Rocket Knight Adventure/Streets of Rage/Golden Axe vibe. Really love the soundtrack too.....some of the tracks are real head bangers!!

Colourful and engaging, maybe slightly repetitive but its a great co-op experience!"
24859,"I can't even express how much this game means to me. I love my younger brother, but we never really spent a lot of time together. Him and I are the only brothers in a large family of mostly girls, all of whom couldn't care less about me or him. I felt so bad that I just didn't have a lot of time to hang out with him, with work and school and my own personal selfishness. Then I bought Castle Crashers. It was ok, especially for an old title. One day I was playing it, and my 7 year old brother walks by, and he's like, ""that looks fun."" And I didn't say a word, I just plugged in the old F310 and handed it to him. I let him kiss all the princesses. 120 hours later, with almost every character unlock, I can 100% reccomend this game and 100% say that my relationship with my brother has improved so much because of this game, as well as Battleblock Theater, and now Pit People. Thanks for a masterpiece, Behemoth.

11/10 would fix relationship with little bro"
24860,A good mix of humour and action. Love it! :D
24861,BEST GAME EVER.
24862,gud gam
24863,"Interesting story if you flip the word ""god"" around it means ""dog"" let that sink in."
24864,Great game
24865,sick!
24866,"Best MOBA game out there.



11/10

24867,"what a disappointment 7n7

this game is only kill mobs"
24868,"Fun, quick, easy to finish game w/ players and they have added an insane mode after beating it that I am excited to start. 
Kick back game w/ controller, things to reach for, etc."
24869,This is what got me out of the great depression
24870,)
24871,10/10
24872,you have friends? they have a pc that can start up? then get this game
24873,Awesome game if u have a group of friends to play it with.
24874,"I really recomend this game to people
"
24875,Castle Crashers is very hot. when all the animals pooped i went near the poop and i imagine if it was all over my face. it felt very good. My favorite level is when you go into the spa with all the fish people. i say it sploge. 10/10 IGN
24876,From the same people who made BattleBlock Theater. Expect crude humor and a very fun beat em up. Play with a friend to have a real fun time.
24877,THE GAME WAS AWESOME
24878,"Recommended! Beat it in local co-op and it's a lot of fun. 

The enemies variety, the humor  and other details keep it fresh. Not to mention great controls and gameplay."
24879,Very fun game!!
24880,so glad qui nguyen won the main event last year
24881,"Very cool game, especially if you like multiplayer(u can play with friends + skype)."
24882,"Can be really boring, just play with friends."
24883,Me and my 2 boys aged 7 and 8 loved this game.  Wish there were more fun coop games like this.  Character.  Fun and RPG elements without being too tough. Hope they do more soon!  Can anyone recommend anything similar?
24884,"Get a controller, get a friend or two and you will love this game!

It is really fun, it has cool bosses and enemies, it has nice artstyle, multiple characters to play with, it has humor and it is overall a good game.

Is it wort 11,99 € ?
It is. You can't go wrong with this game."
24885,"I played this game with a couple of school friends awhile back, it was defo loads of fun and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing games like Magicka and BattleBlock Theater.

With 3 people we managed to complete the storyline in around 10 hours or so.

If you feel a bit effy about the game, then there's a little demo version you can try out for free on Steam. ;)"
24886,The occasional fart joke is few and far between these days. Castle Crashers definitely bring the farts back to your living room in this classic.
24887,"I liked playing this game. I always liked games like this since I was 6 or 7. This is probably one of the best I've played. If you don't have this, you need to get it. If there was a star rating system, this would get 4.5 stars at least."
24888,"this is a good game me and my freinds play it
"
24889,become one with the sword. and the sword shall be with you
24890,"I wish there was a DLC that added another campaingn that was much bigger.

This game is still amazing though."
24891,it's really fun game it will be more fun if you just play it with your friends and family
24892,HEY LOOK A GOOD GAME
24893,Cannot find friends play with me. What a pity...
24894,"A good game played and beat on Xbox when it came out


Ups:

Good Story

Humor

Action

Good Graphics 

Huge Character Selection                                      (I got the black smith DLC make sure to get that too)

Cool Enemies

A Kick Ass Boss




Downs:

Keep your processor and video cards updated and up to date

Multiplayer is sorta dead 

that's all I could think of.


Overall:

Castle Crashers is a child hood favorite with pretty funny characters and scenes good graphics and an epic story to save a bunch of princesses so must give this game a solid

9.5/10"
24895,The best for getting on with a bunch of friends and kicking some ass. Great game!
24896,iced creams
24897,fuck
24898,"Castle Crashers is a very fun single player or co-op experience similar to the good 'ol days Double Dragon and Streets of Rage beatem up style games but with its own unique story line and humor as well as a robust leveling system, weapon upgrades (tiered by lv) and pet boosts.  There is also tons of replayability here and there are secrets all over the map once you have unlocked certain things in the story so the fun is not even close to being done once you beat the story mode.  You can also unlock 20+ characters to play and level up as which also keeps it fun and fresh!

The game has been around for quite a while and has had quite the support as well as new stuff added to it over the years.  I originally purchased this on my Xbox 360 when it came out and played it quite a bit.  I re-purchased it on Steam to complete my collection and have had just as much fun if not more fun as I did when it was brand new.

If you like beatum up style games with a bit of leveling and weapon progression as well as a funny story, this game is for you.  I recommend it for sure!  Its even more fun with a group of three of your friends as you fight over sharing money while arguing over who should unlock the weapon or pet first and in which order everyone will get it!  Fun times indeed!"
24899,my favorite color of the alphabet is trinagle and 3/4
24900,Noice game
24901,y e e t
24902,Very fun
24903,I don't like playing industrial castle on insane pepehands
24904,Best game in history of button smashers!
24905,creative and funny! behemoth has some of my favorite games!
24906,"if you're looking for a good co-op game, look elsewere. 

this game just makes you mad at who ever you're playing with, every time you win you feel cheated in some way, people take health and items without asking, and money and experience isnt shared so one person is always way farther than the other."
24907,Super fun to play even by yourself. Story is funny and good. The arena is fun to destroy your friends. Get it when it's on sale
24908,"Realy funny game! Had alot of fun playing it with 3 friends and I would recomend to play as a group of 4 for most potential fun. You should give it a try even when playing solo , still fun."
24909,All the behemeth games are great and this one especially.  It has a hilarious story line that ends with...how do you put this...A plot twist? Good enough from thieves to bears this is one of the greatest games I played in a while.
24910,AMAZING
24911,"Castle Crashers is a fun beat'em up game with elements of an rpg.
It's perferfect if you play the game with friends, the way how it should be played!
And what about the game itself:
There are tons of humor and refferences poppin up throughout the game.
Gameplay is enjoyble - even if you zre playing on key-board.
High chances of replayabillty because of the lvl'ing up and hardmode.
Though I'm kind of sad that the took away Chomping contest, it was loads of fun)
Overall the game deserves at least a try, so think about it."
24912,This is a crazy and amazing videogame it's so funny and I can laugh for hours with it I recommend it a lot
24913,"Got this game from friend by gift , to be honest this game need to play with close friends in real world because the matchmaking online party is dead nobody online anymore in the server for years , then i check this game sale on humble bundles website just for 2.99 usd for 4 packs. It's enjoyable for 1st release in 2012 but now its just a simple game just to kill some time in boring moment of days.  

PROS : 

1. Avenue for Expression
They enable gamers to express or vent out their frustrations and anger in a relatively safe and controlled environment.

2. No Direct Relation
Amid the increasing popularity of violent video games, youth violence was in its lowest levels in 32 years, according to federal crime statistics. From 1995-2008, video games sales more than quadrupled, but juvenile violent crimes fell 49.3%.

3. Develop Various Skills
Violent video games improve activity of the right side of the brain, helping the person enhance his strategic thinking, memory, creativity and problem solving skill.

4. Age-Defying
Since violent scenarios induce pumping of adrenaline and quick decision-making, exposure to violent video games may delay the ageing process.

5. Teach Action-Consequence
The games teach the players about adhering to the rules and the learning the consequences of each action, particularly violence begets violence.

CONS :

1. Violence is Fun
Violent video games make hurting and killing people entertaining. This notion that violence is fun can cause gamers to imitate the game just for fun.

2. Decentralizing Effect
The games have decentralizing and desensitizing effect to players, inhibiting the ability to differentiate between fantasy and reality.

3. Cause Addiction
Violent video games tend to be very addictive, eating up much of the time and attention of gamers, and causing unhealthy lifestyles.

4. Makes Violence Acceptable
The games impart that violence is an effective strategy for solving conflicts and for attaining one’s goals. A 2009 research found that those who play violent video games believe in violent strategies more than those who play nonviolent video games.

5. Immersion into Violent Character
Advance game controllers and peripherals require players to engage more physically with the game, a form of immersion into the violent characters in the video game.

RATE 4.5/10 . </3"
24914,"Super repetitive, co-op couldn't save it, got tired."
24915,"Explosive adventuring awaits! The game that allows you to hack and slash..... WITH FRIENDS. I know kinda crazy that Behemoth is one of the only game companies doing that. Gotta give credit where credits due, this game is awesome."
24916,Love the game and its creative art style. Would reccomend for anyone trying to chill for a bit.
24917,"Great humor, story, and gameplay!"
24918,"Amazing game in every sense. It's a timeless classic. The game is a side scrolling beat em up and is super addicting, you can play with up to 3 friends and have the greatest fun a game has to offer for a very long time. I spent over 200+ hours combinded including my ps3 version of the game, if you have your doubts, it's a behemoth game. nuff said."
24919,VARY KOOL GAME FART YOU HAVE  TO DO  CHOS YORE CARIKTAR  THEN  JAST FIGHT THER WILL  BE  BOSIS  AND THAS IT
24920,"Its a good game but if you want to have fun... get a controller. i really do hope that The Behemoth makes this game more playable on keyboard and mouse.
Thats my only complaint

Castle Crashers 6.5/10"
24921,"I love this game! It's so much fun, that is if you have people to play with. I would rate this 9 knights out of 10"

24923,One of The best Games
24924,its a really great game

24928,a
24929,timeless masterpiece.
24930,"A damn good old-fashioned, button-bashing, side-scrolling beat-em-up in the vein of streets of rage but with a million-billion unlocks and massive replability. An awsome little game. Plus, it's got local co-op. What's not to love? Why waste your time reading reviews? You could be crashing castles right now!"
24931,"A fun little game to play with buddies. 

Story: Though the main story is short, it's very fast-paced and will throw you across a large variety of scenarios one after another. After completing this story, there will still be a hard mode and other vs modes to try, so the content doesn't end there. 

Gameplay: I will warn you this game isn't one to play alone. It does offer both local and online, so if you have any buddies capable of playing it, you're good to go. The default keybindings were very odd for me, but luckily the game offers full control over key settings, so I was able to change it to a way I liked. As you go through the game you'll be unlocking multiple chracters to play, who will all have their own set lvls. As you lvl them you'll be able to choose which stats they develop in, so when you try new characters you can try new builds as well. 

Do I recommend it?: If you have somebody to play with and feel like going on a fun little adventure, yes."
24932,One of the best Local CO-OP and Hack&Slash games even to this day!
24933,"After 10 hours of gameplay (i suck, so i had to grind some XP and Money to get further in the game) i somehow managed to finish the game, so i can finally rate it!

 9/10 

 Great game, but it could be longer. (I know, that i can play with friends and make it longer (or shorter) and i can play as different characters, but if i play singleplayer and one character the whole game, it is not that long. Apart from that, i love the game in many ways, such as: Low system requirements, Beautiful artwork, Co-Op, Cheap DLCs and [spoiler]that volleyball minigame on the sand castle rooftop.[spoiler]
 Nice job!"
24934,Awesome! Super fun and addictive! Love playing it with friends!
24935,"Very awesome game! I really enjoy playing this with my friends.

"
24936,"Great game.  Lots of fun with friends.  Seems to only do online instead of offline LAN, but still worked on my slow internet."
24937,slash slash crash crash
24938," Played on Playstation for years with my nephew, picked it up on Steam for nostalgia's sake. Still love it."
24939,Very Fun i Wish they would make another game like a prequeal but its just my opinion.
24940,"Written by 6 yr old Son who recently completed the game:

It is super aewsome. It is so great my head almost blew up."
24941,It's a great game 10/10 but Impossible play without a controller
24942,"I first played this on Xbox 360 many years ago and spent hours upon hours replaying it, so I was ecstatic to find it on Steam. While simplistic in terms of design and gameplay, the sheer amount of characters, weapons and pets provide it with some depth, allowing you to try out different combinations of such to find the one set that works for you. Graphically, it's one of my favourites, with the art and animation giving the game immense charm. The soundtrack also provides this in spades along with the myriad of sound effects for attacks, enemies or even just background noise, fully immersing you in the experience. Obviously best when played co-op with friends, though the sheer amount of things going on can be a bit overwhelming if you're not used to it, though that's not to say there aren't many hours of fun to be had in a solo experience as well."
24943,Best beat um up game ive ever played
24944,Battleblock Theater was better.
24945,"Addictive Action RPG. Loads of unlockable characters, levels and weapons. The boss fights are intense, the level design is great--this game does no wrong.

Back in my Xbox Live days, my brothers and I unlocked EVERYTHING. Now I can play this game on Steam with my youngest bro (who was too little to be useful way back when and now fares better than me), and the game is still as great."
24946,THIS GAME IS LITTTTT AF💦👌 YOU BASICALLY BEAT THE SH!T OUT OF EVERY SINGLE FAKING PERSON IN THE GAME AND AT THE END YOU GET PU$$Y FROM ALL THE PRINCESS YOU SAVE.
24947,"The Behemoth's incredibly fun cooperative beat'em-up would've been pure brawler perfection if the multiplayer had launched in better form. It's incredibly frustrating that it's easier to play Castle Crashers with strangers than with your friends, but it's still a great brawler that will soak up your time. Between unlocking new characters so you can level them up to finding all of the hidden weapons and animal orbs, there's a lot to do in the campaign mode."
24948,"This game is a classic, there should be way more like it. 

Decently long storyline, huge amount of content, depth and secrets to keep you playing. Best of all is the local-coop component which is the way the game was meant to be played."
24949,"I know it may look like I don't have many hours in this game, but I have beat it many times and over! YES ALL CHARACTERS!
Each and every character has a very unique play style and mastering them can be very challenging and that is one of many good qualities of this game!
Even though it is a fairly old game, it is never too late to start loving it!
I rate 10/10! I have it on PC, Xbox 360, and Xbox One! 
I have most likely over 500+ hours on it. (Proabably alot more lmao)"
24950,"That is one really cool game beat em up styled and it has a cool story and i think its worth it but i got it on sale so yeah.
I do recommend this game!"
24951,"A hilarious and we'll play game with friends. Single-player is also fun but it loses the magic as time goes on posting by yourself. It's way more effective with friends but I'd still say it's good as there is multi-player so you're never alone.

My votes a yes. : D"
24952,"合家歡。朋友一齊玩一流

24953,"Beautiful
"
24954,yes please
24955,Great game that can be enjoyed alone or with friends and really sets the standards high for The Behemoth along-side Battleblock theater
24956,"Love the game to bits. Was my first real ""gamer game"" growing up. Sure I had the WII but this game was what really brought me into the gaming community. The team seems really nice and seem to truly care about there game and fans as a whole. 10/10 community, gameplay, and dev team."
24957,"[h1]Entertaining and highly enjoyable.[/h1]

[b]Best when played with friends.[/b]"
24958,.
24959,"An overall good game with fun gameplay, awesome bosses and large diversity of weapons I just wish it had a sequel🙁"
24960,Played the game first on Xbox. Loved it. Now playing it again on pc. Still love it.
24961,This game is a lot fun to play with friends.Allowing you to choose between many different heros and allowing you to play story mode with friends makes this game Very amusing.This game is Simple and easy to play.After a few turns with your hero you will know how to play this game.I HIGHLY recommend playing this game with friends because It's just a non stop advenutre waiting for you and your friends to defeath It's bosses.
24962,"Un juego buenisimo. Viciante. Buenas ilustraciones, animaciones, etc. Una campaña que te deja viciado, variedad  de armas y mascotas. Recomendado cuando este en oferta :)"
24963,"ITTTTSSSSSS AWWWEWWEEEEEESSSSSSSOOOOOOMMMMMMMEEEE
"
24964,"Very cute and nice side scrolling game, and I loved that we can play with 4 friends!"
24965,Ok.
24966, banana
24967,"Just as the tags say. And it does it amazingly. Playng with friends makes it even more fun. Looking for a beat'em up, action adventure game? Buy this.

9/10"
24968,"Castle Crashers is a game I have picked up and put down casually for at least a couple of years now.  Online, and couch Coop play make this game so much fun.  Beat the game, and then try it again with another character that you unlock.  Yeah, once you know the stages it can be a grind. I prefer to just jump around the map and play what the crowd wants to try though."
24969,"This game is timeless, and I have played it on 3 separate systems. It was still fun every time. I nominated this game for ""Test of Time"" 2016 and will never regret it."
24970,"10/10
Behemoth's crown jewel is on Steam. Marvelous. Who would have thought this game off the Xbox Live Arcade store would be such a huge smash hit. Just goes to show that many of the best games don't have to be Triple A. Although Behemoth is Triple A in my eyes from just the humor they put into their games alone. 

TLDR~~~ CAN'T RECOMMEND ENOUGH! BUY IT!!$$!!"
24971,10/10 worth the money
24972,Why havent you bought it yet?
24973,"Very fun and entertaining, if you are thinking about it, get it, it is definately worth the money."
24974,Best sidescroller beat em up ever
24975,the behemoth is god......game is A+
24976," A deer is pooping so hard, that he goes faster than a car 9/11 IGN would deer again!"
24977,"Castle Crashers is my go to game for cutesy, hilarious, beat-em-up goodness.  My avatar comes from the fine people at the Behemoth.  Easy to pick up and play.  Up to 4 players can join in on the looting, meleeing and backstabbing all for the love of a princess who may or may not know you exist.  Challenge your friends' hi-scores, duke it out mano a mano in the Arena.  See if you can outlast the horde or black knights, ninja, fire demons, thugs,  cyclops, aliens, would-be bride-stealers 
other not so nice creatures in story mode.   Can you make to the top of the leaderboards?  Fine..  Now can you maintain your dominance in Castle Crashers party style competitive eating?!    And that's not tali end of the giant cat boss barring your way to victory.      

A must buy.  Get it when it goes on sale.  

Pros-  Sweett indie art  (so pretty to look at)
           Turn gore on or off  
            melee and magical combat
            lots of enemy and player variety
           control scheme is easy as pie.         
           built in multiplayer local and online co-op
           those fancy leaderboards  I was talking about
            animal orbs
           loads of weapons to wreak sweet destruction on the heads of your frenemies.
            Bash the Barbarian minigame is tons of fun
            With DLC you can play as the King and a pink knight.   




Cons-  It's going to take a long time to reach level 99 for your character
            INSANE MODE- doesn't net you any additional achievements
            Leaderboards, have ridiculously attainable records
            Most enemies can be a pain  to deal with in Insane Mode,  (Don't say I didn't warn you)  
            It will remind you that real life sucks sometimes and we all can't ride  on top of deer that poop in a sawmill.
"
24978,So fun if you are playing with three other friends! Awesome levels and competitive play
24979,Played this game on the Xbox 360 when i was younger. Now thats its on steam my life is complete now.
24980,Great game!!!
24981,Fun game to play solo or with friends.  Love the sense of humor and the collectability of weapons / pets.
24982,"Juego de gran calidad,divertido y rejugable.No tengo casi nada que decir de este juego asi que comenzemos.Si piensas que este juego sera de estos que los pasas asi por asi no sera asi absolutamente es un tanto dificil en algunas partes y deberas que repetirlas tantas veces como para pasarsela y cuando las pases tendras un pequeño truco de como pasarlo,jugar con amigos lo hace mucho mas divertido y te lanzas unas risas en algunas partes.Aunque el juego sea muy simple ese es su fuerte ya que puedes saber donde se consigue mas facil tal cosa o en tal lugar se farmea tal,cosas de ese estilo.Lo unico negativo que le veo al juego es que a la hora de jugar con amigos o con jugadores algunas veces se bugea o ocurre un fallo que no te esperabas.
No hay mucho que decir de este juego.
¿Recomiendas este juego?
Claro que si,si te gusta algunos juego simples,divertidos y con un poco de dificultad te recomiendo este titulo."
24983,"Funny game, sawblades go brrrrrrr 10/10 would die if played insane mode again"
24984,Fun beat-em-up game with cutesy graphics.
24985,"Pretty fun, actually. just tryin to get my hands on pit people"
24986,Great split screen game to play with friends and family.
24987,"Castle Crashers is an incredible 4 player, hack and slash adventure. If you like:
Beating up bad guys
travelling through different stages
using a huge arsenal of weapons
casting magic
defeating gigantic bosses
griefing gold
playing as a variety of different characters...

This is the game for you!"
24988,Good Game
24989,the best co-op game
24990,"Multiplayer has issues, when one player has a mediocre connection (2 bars) the game will freeze momentarily for everyone until that person catches up to the other players. Not only that, if one person has the DLC and their base damage is increased above those of standered starting players, they can easily take the princess within a couple of hits. 

The way that the coin system works is also pretty stupid, player sided currency makes co-operative play quite unfriendly, in the sense that one player might have 90 coins, whilst another will have 14. This means that the player with the most coins can progressive further than those who dont, causing a more unbalancing system. 

I play quite a few co-operative based games and I can say that this has been my personal least favorite."
24991,I have not had this much fun in a Co-op game in a long time. I highly recommend this game to anyone in search of a fun game to play with your friends.
24992,"I first played this game on Xbox 360. I bought it on Steam and have been playing it with my 5yo and 3yo. They both enjoy playing it with me and its pretty simple when all they need to do is hit the button on the controller I gave them. They like it because they are not quite ready for any of the lego games but love playing games with dad.

I recomend this game if you want a game to play with your kids, or your buddies that doesn't require much more than fun button mashing. My kids favorite thing is to fight over who gets the princess."
24993,very bad game. if you die someone have to revive you and when you come back you have 1hp. it just sucks
24994,"I have played this game since I was a child. It is fantastic! Behemoth truly have outdone themselves with Castle Crashers! It has amazing replay value, just because of how fun it is! I played it on my old Xbox 360 for hour on end, beating it at least 20 times! And here I am, years later still playing the same game, still horrible at it and still having the time of my life."
24995,Pretty fun game.
24996,"Everything Behemoth makes is pure gold. I love their humor, art style, and the games they make. I love castle crashers. A good friend of mine showed me this game years ago when I was still in high school and I'm STILL playing it. Ignore my hours on steam-it's a lie. This is a perfect couch co-op game with a hilarious story about rescuing princesses and bashing faces in along the way. I love the quirky characters, the weird weapons, and the wacky enemies. This game is almost overwhelmingly silly-but the actual gameplay is serious as can be. It's a side scrolling action adventure game with RPG elements in that you can level up your characters and customize whether they're phsical damage heavy brutes, high HP tanks, magic weilding mages, etc. I've played through the story seemingly a million times with I'm pretty sure every character (I love how the little enemies can later be played as AND you get to use their special abilities) and I'll keep doing it to the end of time. I don't think I'll ever get bored with this game-even though I'm fairly certain at this point I know where all the enemies are and all the weapons/pets are hidden in the game world.
If you want a good adventure beat-'em-up game to play by yourself or with a friend-try this game out. And then check out the other stuff Behemoth has made."
24997,love the game soo much fun
24998,"Awesome game even years after release! Gameplay is fun as hell, character progression and levelup is well-made and makes me come back even after beating the game. Soundtrack is epic and so is the comedy. 

Only downside I can think of is that some bosses get frustrating because of the lack of checkpoints (sometimes you have to restart the whole level), and the game is obviously not designed to be played by just one player, for it gets quite hard alone (at least as a magic-user). 

Overall a solid 9/10."
24999,One of the BEST and FUNNIEST games! I REALLY recommend this Along with BattleBlock Theature (Because This Gives you An Exclusive Character) I played Alot With My Brother (We use Xbox Controllers) Try it with a Friend!
25000,"humorous action game, solo play is good enough, 2x more fun if there's 4 buddies playing."
25001,nating lick it
25002,"A fun ""little"" button mashing party game with up to 4 people, Just like your average gang bang."
25003,"it is fun
"
25004,"Buy The ""Castle Crashers 4-pack bundle"" and have a good time with friends for chrismas"
25005,amazing game 10/10!
25006,"Castle Crashers is a fun, simple beat-em-up.  When I purchased it, the PC port was quite bad, but this has been fixed with the new updates."
25007,good game
25008,"A great co-op game to play with your buddies.

Note:Only buy this game if you have friends who own it,or else it will get boring REALLY fast."
25009,"Castle Crashers is a great game that you'll have an amazing experience!

IF YOU GOT FRIENDS TO PLAY WITH ANYWAY!!!"
25010,It is literally one of the best game that i have played for so long.... Although it look a little bit childish But the story is surprisinly good. I didnt expect much just by looking at it but when i play with my friends I have so much fun about it.. So  highly recommend if you are playing with ur friends
25011,"Nice game, just needed to be bigger and have more levels, it is like a marriage, most of the time you fight, but at the end you will have the benefits of it.
Played it 5 days straight."
25012,"Words cannot express how awesome this simple game is! The vibrant and overwhelming atmosphere, the wacky gameplay. Everything just comes into place nicely! I am a fan of couch coop games like these. And i must say everytime i play this game i couldnt help but laugh! Oh gosh... such memories. You guys should definitely buy this game if you like hack and slash games or just lookin for something to play with someone."
25013,Probably the best steam game you should defonly get
25014,The best indie game. Ever.
25015,"This game is funny. Its better to play with some friends, since is a lil boring wait for online unkown players.
But you can get many laughs with this game!"
25016,"Make sure you have some friends who didn't already hack the game to get all level 100 characters before you start playing this, because although it's good to play alone, it is SO MUCH BETTER to play with friends.

Plus the combat's solid

Also the humor + art was good







I guess that's kind of it."
25017,i too have had this game and beat this game on xbox360 but im telling you this game is so good if you ever have doubts just buy it go for it guy reading this!!!!
25018,yes
25019,yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssssssssss AMAZING!!!!!!!!!
25020,Castle Crashers is my all time favorite game. It was the first game I ever bought when i was like 8 on the xbox 360 and its been my favorite game since. BUY THIS MF GAME.
25021,gud
25022,"Great game, if you have a controller and friends to play with."
25023,"awsome!!!!!! :)
"
25024,It's a nice game. 8/10 i guess.
25025,Eskimo approve
25026,"Extremely great game, Has a very special place in my heart and it always will. Very fun especially when you're playing with your friends!


10/10 =P"
25027,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! This is one of the best games I have played in my life! Very fun with its 4-player co-op, amazing replayability, all around great time! If you are reading this, pick this and BattleBlock Theater up ASAP, as these are amazing!

GAMEPLAY-

The combos feel very smooth and easy to master, and I feel I get them at a good pace. Spine-crushingly difficult, but also fun- I do have the complaint that there are a lack of mid-level checkpoints. Bosses are intuitive and fun to fight.

PRESENTATION-

The art style, in Behemoth fashion, is cute and funny, as are the actual in game events. Special credits to the Thieve's Forest Level in humor!

VALUE- 

I got this for 80% off during the sale, but even for 15 dollars this is good- you will spend 10+ hours for your first playthrough and 100+ as you replay with other characters. HUGE VALUE!

POSTGAME-

After you beat the game once, insane mode becomes available to play- 100% completion is obtained by beating the game  in insane mode with all characters. 62 playthroughs. SO MUCH TO DO!!

In summary this is a great game- So much playtime, all of which is fun and enjoyable!"
25028,"Fun game, got it as a gift, there is some input lag but will for ever be one of my all time favourite games to enjoy with friends."
25029,Shmexy Best Game Ever.
25030,assh0le crasherz
25031,Great game to play with friends. Or enemies. Or both.
25032,best game
25033,"This is one of my favorite games, it never gets old to just hop on and play, the humor is very funny and i love the art style, theres alot to this game and its always fun to play with friends"
25034,"It was okay, kinda short. Magic combat is relatively fun, so if you're looking for a complicated playstyle, try that. Otherwise combat is pretty straightforward, use melee or bow."
25035,verry fun with friends
25036,cool game
25037,"It's a neat game, maybe too short considering."
25038,Caslte Crashers is an amazing fun and funny game! Very great humour that worked with the gameplay. Played it when it was first released and then repurchased it when it went on sale. Classic
25039,I recommend this game
25040,"While I don't have much time played on PC, I bought this game on Xbox360 when it first came out, and it has stayed a magnificent game throughout all of that time. It isn't complicated, it's not too serious, and it really just allows a fun time. This game is especially entertaining when you play with friends, because the game itself is silly enough to make one person happy, but when you add a bunch of people into the equation is just feels more complete."
25041,"Fun game, something to go to when you need a break from another game"
25042,100/100. Fun game with friends :D
25043,IM GONNA BREAK THIS GAME INTO AWESOMENESS
25044,"Ótimo jogo, coop muito bom pra passar o tempo."
25045,10/10 really fun with friends
25046,"Castle crashers is an awesome beat em up game 
"
25047,Very Good game worth the money!
25048,Loads of fun!  Playing with others is even better (:
25049,Dank game would play again 11/10
25050,its a great game and when you deafet a boss im like YOUR GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
25051,"This game made me upset. I didn't crash a single castle. Way to be, Tom Fulp."
25052,THE BEST GAME!!!
25053,Awhile back my brother had gotten castle crashers on the xbox 360. He bought a few games on it and one being castle crashers. We would play days from weeks to months on this game. It was very enjoyable till my brother moved then i got a computer. So i bought castle crashers for the fondness of it. Pluse any one reading this you may have a balst playing this game cause i do.
25054,"This game is a must play! So much fun especially with friends. Even my wife likes is. You can beat it in a few hours, and it never seems to get old. Some might think the humor is a bit immature, but I loved that the game is so funny.

The only thing not to like is that if you are an OCD or completionist person like me and want to max out character stats, that can take forever to do. After a while character leveling slows to the point you might play through the entire game again with a character and not level once. At that point the character is beyond strong enough to beat the game alone though, so it doesn't really matter."
25055,"You smash, smash and smash your enemies! Nice beat 'em up game with clean art, fun simple story and lot of stuff to unlock, I had great time playing this with friends! I only played single player a little bit but that was fun too, but I think this is one of those game that is best when played on multiplayer."
25056,"Fun, smooth, engaging, pleasant, self-aware, and quite colorful. I enjoyed this game thoroughly until the mechanics slowed it to a crawl. Maybe I was playing it wrong, but toward endgame the sheer number of hits required to take down an enemy, even with the best equipment I could get, became nothing more than a time sink. 

I've wanted to replay it, but the prospect of listening to the endless din of attack sounds has deterred me indefinitely."
25057,a rally funny version of darksouls
25058,good
25059,"Beheading your friends for the kiss of a princess

12/10"
25060,Party play is much more enjoyable than solo play. A simple yet fun button masher. Madness!
25061,"This game is so great. It is basicly similar to old beat them up games experience which I was really missing. What is even more fun is the fact the you can coop with 3 more people in completing this game. There are also many unlockables like weapons and characters and you can unlock them all by... just playing the game (no DLC, for real) and isn't that an amazing thing in 2017? 10/10"
25062,dem it feels good to be a gangstaaa
25063,"Castle Crashers was something I use to embrace my childhood. When I was younger my brother and I would play this game on the PS3. I only bought it on Steam due to some friends wanting to play it and I can say without a doubt that the magic of the game has not lost its touch on me. This game was a large part of my imaginative afternoons and was something that could get me seated for hours, something no other game has done. The characters are all unique and really fun to use, despite the obvious power-advantage some have compared to others. The music is an easy 10/10. Continue the crusade on one of the greatest games ever made."
25064,Not a bad game with friends. if you're alone it loses its charm fast
25065,"This game is tons of fun wrapped up in somewhat dark and gross silliness mixed with a satisfying amount of killing! Though difficult at certain points, this game is definitely worth the buy and will most likely keep you coming back to it for years!

I personally could have done without all the poop jokes though."
25066,"got it on sale,best decision ever,this shall provide laughter and fun.

As they say: THY SHALL BUY!"
25067,"I recommend this game because it takes hours if you have nothing to do, this game is right if you have extra time to play."
25068,this game is a fun game u should play if u are bored... im a csgo player and when im waiting for offers or any prem8s to a match i play this game... recomended on the strongest. i rly like the gameplay and the bosses.. 1 sec to learn 1 life to master :D
25069,"Classic, this game is great with friends."
25070,It's a really awesome and fun to play with friends!
25071,"Holly sh*t this game is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! The gameplay is perfect and the jokes are so wellmade. Probably one of the best games ive ever played!!!!!! The only problem is that the variety of magic is a bit lackluster, there are only under 8 different kinds of magic. BUT THAT STIL ONLY MAKES IT A BIT WORSE, LIKE 0.000000001%"
25072,"I haven't played this game too much, but neither has anyone else. Although I haven't spent too much money, unlike Counter Strike, this has done some shit.
[b]This game is beautiful[/b]
[list]
    [*] I ran away from a giant, black, and hairy box cat by riding a deer that likes to shit a lot,
    [*] It caused fustration because I couldn't find my Ps3 controller charger to plug it into my laptop,
    [*] The boss fights were painful because the easiest ones took an hour to complete,
    [*] The 'Catfish' boss level killed me for a long while until that fucking cat got dominated after I leveled up and regained health,
    [*] I am not sure if it helped break a friendship or helped save it but either way I am lonely now,
    [*] The game pressures me to buy the pink knight because it is so overpowered,
    [*] It was a life saver when I wasn't able to play competetive on Counter Strike.
[/list]

In the end, this game is a great little game, it is fun for multiplayer and it is also fun when you are leveling up your favorite knight just so you can kick your friends ass next time you two do a co-op story.

I would also reccomend Battle Block Theater but I am not writing a review."
25073,"I chopped my friends to pieces so i could make out with a hot blonde.

15/10 would recommend chopping my friends to pieces so i could make out with a hot blonde."
25074,"Hey, thats pretty good"
25075,"awsome game 






"
25076,Great game!
25077,this is my favorite game of all time it has funny knights and makes me feel wanted
25078,"Amazing Game Great Combat Mechanics And Gameplay, Would Highly Recomend And If There Is A Sale Definately Buy This Game, You Wont Regret It"
25079,For fun and For wasting time
25080,"Very good and fun game and even more amazing with friends. Great plot, HUGE weapon selection, a lot of different characters and there are 3 game modes and insane mode for more skilled players.
I definetly recommend to buy it.
8.5/10"
25081,KILL YOUR FRIENDS FOR KISSES TODAY BUY IT
25082,<3 This game is a fun online hack and slash campiagn with friends :D
25083,Classic
25084,"Great game. Fun to play with the kids also. I play with my 6 year old, and she loves it. A little fart humor doesn't hurt keeping her entertained also."
25085,Great game! It has given me a new appreciation for co-op games.
25086,***** Shitely addictive
25087,"TL;DR = Good with Friends

I've bought this game years ago, tried to play a few times, but it never caught me. I really liked the concept of the game but i've found something was lacking, the game was falling too short. Yesterday a couple of friends invited me to play with them and the experience i had with this game was completely different

Pros:
- Graphic Style
- OST
- Simple Gameplay
- Multiplayer Experience
- Multiple Characters adds replayability
- Magic is Good
- Bosses

Cons:
- Solo Play is terrible
- Lacks clarity, sometimes i got very confused about what was going on
- Combos are not that exciting
- Annoying Pauses in Multiplayer
- Levelling System is uninteresting
- Item attributes are not relevant
- Magic System is not explained"
25088,"fun game to play with friends, kinda short tho :("
25089,amazing game childhood favorite
25090,"Fun game. Maybe graphics aren't stunning but the gameplay is a lot of fun, especially with friends.
It's definitely worth it's money."
25091,"This is a really fun party-style game!  My husband and I played for like 7 hours straight when we first started because it was a lot of fun.  I don't know how it would be playing by yourself, but it's definitely a good collaborative game for up to 4 players."
25092,This game is lif af
25093,SOOOOOOOO Fun Super fun with frinds
25094,I got this as a birthday  gift from a friend one if not the best beat um up out there
25095,"one of the best co-op games ever.

11/10"
25096,Great game wish more people played though.
25097,"great
"
25098,"This game was apart of my childhood. It was really there when I had nothing to do when I got home and the constant pace it's kept through my life has held true. I enjoy this game to the core, from the artistic style choice to the level progression and bosses. Each new level is like a roller coaster ride full of jokes and story when there is no words at all. It really has came a long way and I'd love to see them add more content. Though for right now i'm content. I highly reccomend this game if you've never played. It's easy to pick up and you can awlays come back to play when you're bored."
25099,"Awesome stuff. Wether I'm alone or with buddies, so much fun. 10/10"
25100,"I came here to kill my friends and fuck... Fuck! Princess is a trap, but i am all outta Friends. Great CO-OP party game."
25101,.
25102,"I personally have not complete this game, but I love it. The art style is hilariously funny and the gameplay is flowing and easy. The level system is fair, but beware of the bows. If you choose nothing but damage when you upgrade, bows are your bain. Just spam Jump and you will be A.O.K. There is only one other issue that I have run into, and it is not toooooo game breaking, if restarting a single level is not toooooo game breaking. Check out my screenshots to see it. It contains rage moments when it first happened, and another set when I got the EXACT SAME RESULT, as well as greater detail on how this happens. If your completely new to the game, and you don't want a single peak at one chunk of a level, than maybe not. Anyway, my luck was really poor so it may never happen to you. Go and buy this game right now. Don't have money, GET SOME RIGHT NOW! The game is worth every penny! Go for that 100%, and PINK AND PURPLE KNIGHT FOR THE WIN BOIZ!"
25103,"Lovely game. Just get it, you will NEVER regret it."
25104,dude this is the best game ever altho there is a bug but before i say what happens i think is  loading for player 2 it says waiting for players
25105,So much fun! I love this game and always will. I put thousands of hours into it back on my old Xbox 360 and am still here playing it. This will forever be my favorite indie game :D
25106,"A short but very fun game to play with your friends! Great graphics and controls, super funny combo system that looks and feels great! That Amazing Final boss battle was the chery in top of the cake, what a great experience overal! and for less than 3 dollars."
25107,STUPID PIECE OF SH*T F*CKING VOLLEYBALL
25108,This was the best 3 dollars I've ever spent. Bless the Steam Winter Sale.
25109,"this is the funnyest game
"
25110,"The best part of Castle Crashers is exploring the world -- there are tons of levels that look and play completely differently. From slip-n-slide icy terrains to sandy deserts, it's clear that every area was crafted with care by the Behemoth's resident artist, Dan Paladin. The four starting knights wield magic powers that are differentiated by armor color -- Red has lightning, Green has poison, Orange has fire, and Blue has ice. Armed with magic and steel (or maybe a stick), you'll hack your way through mounds of enemies, gain experience points, and level up. As you progress, you'll garner more skill points to divide amongst four traits: Strength, Magic, Defense, and Agility. You can build up your character however you'd like, but that's not the only way you can customize."
25111,"If you have some friends to play with its great. But if you play alone its not mutch fun. I recommend this game because it has funny story and its not so expensive. (I bought it on sales)

for me 7/10"
25112,Go rescue and fight for your purple princess! Others are mine.
25113,"I always remember wanting to play this game when I first saw it on XBLA. I eventually got the chance to do so, and I really did enjoy it. When I saw that it was on Steam, I of course had to plunk down another $15, and it was even more so worth it, since it visually looks better.

Castle Crashers is a sidescrolling hack 'n' slash beat 'em up. The game itself isn't TOO long, but with 4 players, and a ""Hard"" mode (which is as close as you'll get to a New Game +), with several playable characters (that really aren't that different from one another, besides magic and appearence), and the ability to play this game with 3 other people (4 total, the way it was meant to be), there's quite a ton of replayability. Plus, the OST's fantastic, really some of Newgrounds' best.

If you're skeptical, maybe not worth $15, but if it's on sale, worth it all day.

6.5/10"
25114,"I recommend this game, addictive!!!"
25115,"This game is amazing. Definitely worth the money. Made me laugh, made me rage, but hey, who doesn't like rage every now and then? 11/10 Would play again"
25116,"Great fun, HIGHLY SUGGEST PLAYING WITH FRIENDS."
25117,"very fun game for co-op and solo it has the jokes you need in a game like like this and i respect it.
worth the price"
25118,"VERY FUN GAME, to play with friends"
25119,"Great fun game if you have friends. Still equally fun alone, but its better to play with friends, provided you have friends."
25120,A really fun game and i love playing the minigames with friends
25121,"Just like all reviews this review is completely biased as it is in my own experience.

The Pros:
1.) Good graphics with a cartoonish art style
2.) RPG elements
3.) Really fun to play with friends and still pretty fun on your own
4.) Unique characters
5.) Epic boss fights
6.) Cool weapons with buffs and debuffs
7.) Pets to help you in battle
8.) Good soundtrack
9.) Items to help you in battle
10.) Cool combos to fuck up your enemies

The Cons:
1.) Dimensions make it hard to accurately play as an archer
2.) PvP can get annoying due to friends being cocks and teaming up on you
3.) Friends will steal gold and items if you are not fast enough

Overall Rating: 7/10"
25122,Really Good Game For Smashing Enemys Up With A Many Characters To Chose From With Different Special Abilities!

25136,woop
25137,I did like this game. It got a little boring near the end and doesn't have any replay value. I would recommend for friends
25138,Jared leveled up 2 fast!? scam game?
25139,"Personally, Castle Crashers was quite fun for me at first, however, after the first couple of missions and messing about, the game became tedious for me and completing levels felt more like a chore than a game."
25140,"陆陆续续玩了好长时间才通关，中间有几关难度变态，单人不吃血瓶太难过了。游戏不错，玩的很过瘾！！！
i have completed the game finally ,there are several difficult areas,in which i used many red drugs to treat myself.but its a cool game,i love it!!!
tip:my english is terrible :>"
25141,That was neat
25142,i have beaten this game over 8 times.
25143,"This game REALLY should've been in the 'Better with Friends' Steam awards section.
Simple, but at the same time AMAZING graphics, very cool gameplay.
Easy controls, nice story, so fun to play. 
This is a game that you will play when you just want to take a break from all other games.
I loved it."
25144,"Castle Crashers for me was an OG game for me back on the Xbox 360 back in 2009, and being able to play it and beat it all over again in 2016 brought back some good memories of those days. 


If you love indie games, I would highly recommend this game to YOU. This game is very random and very funny and weird suprises are on your way. The characters, backgrounds, weapons and levels are all very creative. I'd tell you what you do in this game but I'd rather have you explore the game for yourself. Also I highly suggest you to get this game with friends as Online CO-OP with friends is really fun


If you start to enjoy this game after purchasing it, PLEASE consider on trying out The Behemoth's other games: Battleblock Theater and Alien Homnid. Also be sure to try out their latest card game, Pit People that will be released in mid January, 2017."
25145,I like game eks dee
25146,Yeah
25147,"hate it
"
25148,this game is a work of art! this has revolutionized the gaming industry and forged it into what it is today. for the unbeatable price of $3 i highly recomend this game to anybody who enjoys crashing castles
25149,"8/10
Amazing game, a ton of variety, a lot of stuff to do. Really amazing graphics if you think about when it was released and achievements! Why I didn't give it a 10/10? I have no friends to play this with :(
P.S. Please add me so we can play together ;^;"
25150,is very gud
25151,it really fun when play with you friend
25152,This game is fun game to play if you got some spare time on your hands and its more enjoyable with friends playing with you.
25153,"Too much crashing, not enough castles"
25154,"Classic, yet still very fun!"
25155,Great little game with friends. I dont like the art style however the coop nature is fun!
25156,Gr8
25157,buy it you will love it if you enjoy beat em ups
25158,I love this game. totally worth it
25159,It's K
25160," Oh boy... i wish this game was longer or at least had a sequel. It seemed like something very important died too early in my life when i finished it.
 Game is fun as hell, beautiful and funny, totally woth it."
25161,blagh amazin
25162,"Extremely fun game, I love the combat, and there are so many levels so the game takes a few hours to complete. 
And you can level up each character individually and choose what attributes to focus on.
There are lots of collectibles to find, and lots of different monsters and bosses to beat. There's also a twisted humor to the game which I love. Perfect difficulty too.
From looking at the trailer of the game I thought this game wasn't my type at all, but I gave it a shot and loved it. I think you should try it too, you may be pleasantly surprised!"
25163,Awesome co-op fun
25164,super fun to play with friends
25165,"To be honest just putting this up because the account experiance, but i liked the game a lot, it's fun to play with friends or complete strangers and even though its got like no replay value (my own opinion) its still really enjoyable. Plus its on sale at the time of this post so thats a major bonus"
25166,"This game is amazing to play alone and with friends, I used to play this on xbox back in 2010, and when i downloaded it on steam when winter sale was going on, the moment I heard the soundtrack i almost cried, nostalgic, amazing.

Time consuming, but worth every second of your life."
25167,where is the necromatic pack and the king pack?
25168,"If you are looking for fun with fellow friends who live even 1 inch away from you, this is not the right game for you. Fucking fix this shitty frame problem."
25169,This game is shit without a controller.
25170,"As a wise man once said, ""Hey, that's pretty good!"" - Idubbbz"
25171,"surprised how much fun this game is, a lot of replay value"
25172,good fun vv glad with purchase
25173,Played it a ton on console back in the day. It seems to have minimal improvements but it's a good co-op game.
25174,Best inbdie game of all time!
25175,Great game to play with friends or solo. <3
25176,"    This game is not bad. I don't think it's good either. But not bad! Not bad at all. The whole game is to similar. The game play gets very repetitive after the Giant Corncob boss is defeated. I think the best part of this game is multiplayer co-op. It's easy to have a bash with friends while playing Castle Crashers. If you like to get way into a game's story, this game is not for you. But if you enjoy fast-paced solo battles and fun multiplayer co-op give Castle Crashers a try. I got nearly 20 hours out of the main story because even though the campaign is short, you can play again and again, unlocking new characters, teaming up with friends, getting all the pets, using new weapons and tactics. Overall, bad story, moderately good mechanics, good multiplayer, and a great many hours of play. I would give Castle Crashers 6.5 out of 10."
25177,"Extremely fun game to play with your friends, the game has a lot of fighting and some funny scenes. The game is pretty easy to beat but thats how you get new characters."
25178,"Awesome And Dunno what else to say.
"
25179,"This game is bloody brilliant. The imagery is hilarious, and it has a nice slight spin off the generic Mario style game. It was so much fun beating the main story, and there are moments in this game I will never forget. I am unsure about the replayability of this game however, but it is good all the same. It definitly works best in multiplayer, and feels rather dull in singleplayer. The final boss was good, and I would recomend this game to anyone who enjoys RPGs and a nice amount of crude humour."
25180,It's good.
25181,"I first bought this game on XBOX 360, and recently found out that there was a steam version.
I absolutely recommend this game, because it is so fun to play.
"
25182,"If you're looking at this game interested in buying it and have never played it before, look no further. all the negative reviews on this game complain about the stupidest shit so just ignore them. But seriously Castle Crashers offers alot of replay value with your friends, has a fun story line, and theres just so much to do. Pick it up right now in for $3 and you won't regret it. Make sure to play with friends though because it makes it that much more fun."
25183,"very gud
"
25184,"Castle Crashers - a fun, but sometimes frustrating game in which you'll try to slay as many enemies as you can. It may sound strange to you, but it's mechanics are fun and they're working suprisingly well; espescially with friends! I would definitely recommend it anybody searching for a 2D platformer! It is great fun and with it's cartoonish style, it won't get boring very fast. You should play it with a controller though, playing this game with a keyboard is just more frustrating."
25185,very good game
25186,"Paid $3 for this on sale, very fun to play with friends.
Awesome game although it would be better if money was shared throughout your party. 

Worth buying at full price i'd say, esp if you are going to play with friends."
25187,Good game
25188,"Love this game
Retro as hell, great fun (especially after a few drinks)
its one of those games that strangely addictive. definitely a more the merrier game and great that its online multiplayer in case you forgot to buy that extra controller....... Like i did so i had to play someone else's copy.

One small annoyance is that trying to use a mouse and Keyboard sucks on this game and you can only really use a controller to get the most out of the game.
That being said its not really a mouse and keyboard game and you want the extra controllers otherwise you cant play Lan games with your mates... (multiple keyboards and mice will just fighter each other before you have even got off the main menu)

Gameplay is really good with, I've not found any bugs while playing. lots of weapons to earn and choose from as you hack and slice your way through the hordes of baddies to save your princess, upgrading your magic and levelling up as you go.

 This an awesome game for all ages.  highly recommended"
25189,Okay
25190,get the bipolar bear and kill your almost-dead teammate and take the princess
25191,"great game brings back a lot of memory's
"
25192,yes.
25193,Never got to play it because it *always* crashes right at the launch screen.  I bought a four pack and it crashes on the three other friends computers too.
25194,10 OUT OF 10 WHOULD RIDE A LAMA EVERDAY
25195,"Castle Crashers is a great Online Co-op RPG game that connects you wih your friends to fight together. I would recommend this game for rookies and veterans alike, it's great for anyone and everyone! I originally played this game on Xbox 360, but now that I ahve the Steam version to compare it with, this outranks the Xbox Castle Crashers by a landslide. I would also recommend purchasing the Blacksmith DLC if you really enjoy it, or the Pink Knight if you prefer that. 5 Stars!"
25196,This game is awesome!!! I played it for many hours without knowing what time it was lol.
25197,"So ,when i first played this game was about 4 years ago and i played it on my ps3,but it was only a demo.The first impression of the game was great.The design,the gameplay is extremely good .So when I saw the game on steam and it was 2,50 I was like: whoa man,I have to buy this game.I played about 50 hours and I'm still playing it when I'm bored.
After the gameplay,I would recommend it for everyone.
Have fun !"
25198,yes
25199,loving this game so far
25200,"Amazing game, can serve as challenging at times, but all in all great fun."
25201,"Nice and fun little game, you get to hack n slash your way to victory and save 4 princesses along the way ;)"
25202,Lots of fun.
25203,"This Game Is Fun - 10/10 - Fake IGN
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
But it needs mod workshop for levels , back off barbarin , weapons , etc..."
25204,Great game to play with friends

Hi all, nukes here.

Castle Crashers is a 2D side scrolling hack and slash adventure. Easy to pick up and play, I enjoyed playing this game solo and online with friends [i](up to 4 players)[/i].

This game is very well put together and the developers have a knack for 2D side scrolling games. Great humour and art styles with a variety of musical artists creating great music for each level.

[h1]The Game Play[/h1]
Simple side scrolling game [i](works best with a controller)[/i]with great combo's and intuitive magic system. Simple levelling system and many different characters you can unlock, items you can find and pets you can make love you.

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]
The difficulty is pretty straight forward but not restricting there is a harder difficulty that you can unlock after completion, which can be found on the map after the first boss. Can only be done with same character.

[h1]Controls & Interface[/h1]
Geared towards playing with a controller but not limited, as keyboard can work just as well.

I just found it much easier with controller.

[h1]Achievements[/h1]
This game has simple and fun achievements that are relatively easy to get and nothing that you would lose sleep over.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You play a knight out to save the princess's and to defeat a dark evil wizard, on your journey you will encounter many hardships. 

[i]Be brave young knight.[/i]


[h1]Combat System [/h1]
The combat system is simple and fun revolving around a hack slash method with great combos that are given to you along your journey through levelling up.

Magic spells are also learnt in the same way which can sway the battle in your favour.

Pet companions can also be found throughout, used to give your character unique perks or advantages in battle that can help on your quest.

[i]Got to love Rammy[/i]

[h1]Leveling[/h1]
Simple levelling system that lets you place points into four attributes that increase your characters stats.

[i]The magic spells, can be quite different per character and all have great uses. Try out different characters to find the spells that suit you.[/i] 

[h1]Sounds & Effects[/h1]
The music for this game was composed by a variety of different artists and I found some of the music to be great and even downloaded a few of them myself from [url=http://www.newgrounds.com/playlists/view/d62b3bece0125e4ab49c9662429c8833]NewGrounds[/url]for free

Favourite has to be this [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp-D02Q7LQw]one[/url] but it isn't listed in the list.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The graphics are simplistic but I found them very pleasing and suiting to the game. 

[h1]Cut Scenes[/h1]
I found the cut scenes well thought-out and funny, got to love the ending of the cyclops.

[h1]Humour & Trivia[/h1]
I loved the humour of this game it is brilliant and suited for all ages and retains the same style throughout.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
This game has a fantastic multiplayer that lets you play co operatively with friends either locally or online. 

Castle Crashers offers a small range of fun multiplayer modes where you can go up against friends in a fighting, feeding frenzy and good old volley ball real man's game.

[h1]Bugs - [i]Important[/i][/h1]
No bugs or issues were found.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I loved Castle Crashers and would happily go back to it if my friends asked, overall fun and great entertainment for all ages.

Great to play with guests or friends at home.

Easy to pick up and play and then just walk away if needed.

I would say the only downside to this game is, that lately the online community has dwindled, best to play with friends.

I will be keeping a close eye on the developers to see if they have any future releases planned as I really do like their style of games.

Hope I helped.

25206,"Pretty nice game, so much fun but if you haven´t got friends online its poor."
25207,"An adorable, fun game that's easy to get the hang of."
25208,Great game to play with friends!!!
25209,"Before: Let's hang out
After: I have sold my soul to keep playing"
25210,Hey thats  pretty good
25211,"It's a good game so far. Fast paced, fun, new upgrades, etc. But they seriously need to fix their bugs. My friends saw completely different things on their screen from me. They would find my character dead while I see myself killed a scorpion. We kept having issues every time we'd get out of the game and get back in. We kept re-doing the level area. Once they fix their bugs, I think this would be a very great game."
25212,"Castle Crashers is a great game to play with your friends and it's a great way to bond with your friends. The length of the game is very short but this is only longer if you try out other characters, level up, collect, ect. If you're going to play one play through of this game don't pick it up. I strongly recommend to play with friends, family, etc to enhance the experience"
25213,"Its amazing, my only complant is the thieves constantly shooting arrows"
25214,Great game for co-op.

25221,"Perfect mix of comedy, action, and violence!"
25222,good games to play with your friends
25223,This is a classic and will always be a classic. The other reviews speak for themselves.
25224,on
25225,It's a beat em up from the brains behind Newgrounds. If you like the humor of early 2000s flash animations this will be right up your alley. Though Castle Crashers has been around long enough you don't need my word. If you want a solid beat em up to play with friends and a bit of nostalgia for the early days of the internet this is worth it.
25226,"In Castle Crashers, you can play as a knight, or enemies and allies of the knights, (after matching certain requirements) defeat the bosses, and rescue the four princesses. There is also Arena and other gamemodes than the storymode. Overall, this is a great and hilarious game that I recommend."
25227,Fun game to play with friends
25228,ayyyyyyyyy cancer gaming
25229,its good
25230,Incredible Game!
25231,love these types of games. great for people that just want to have fun with friends.

Keeps being awesome"
25234,Pink knight is hot.
25235,"Love the game, playable through singleplayer and multiplayer. The game challenges you through different levels, which helps you master combos, controls, and tactics in defeating bosses/enemies. Overall a really thrilling and awesome 2D game, my money was really worth it on this."

25253,"Would be a solid ten if it had less jokes about poo and farting tbh

9.5/10"
25254,"The best co-op game on Steam! (It's also still fun alone!)
This game offers humour, fun and an easy storyline to follow.
A must buy if you like a 2D hack and slash arcade type of game!

Hyped for Pit People! Hope it's just as good as this one!

edit: after formatting my disk all my progress was deleted...would've been nice to have had my data saved onto Steam. I lost all my unlocked characters and my level 80+ Blue Knight. 50 hours down the drain."
25255,"This...

Castle Crashers is a shining example of what casual gaming should be. I know I show low hours played on Steam, but I played this title for literally hundred of hours on Xbox 360 and continue to do so. Just so hard to lose all your character progress to begin on a new platform...

The concept is simple, fight your way through levels, gain experience, distribute points, find weapons, and eventually free the most beautiful princess in all the land. Upon completion you can unlock a new character and do it all over again, or continue with your character into a far more difficult version of the campaign. The gameplay is solid, the humor is at times crude but hilarious, and the entire game just has an upbeat cartoony feel, exactly as intended. 

That is not to say the game is without a few ""oh crap"" moments. Play it through and you will understand the literal humor of this comment. Just too bad Steam will not allow me to give it two thumbs up..."
25256,It's awesome.
25257,pretty good
25258,"Fun and colorfull game, it is getting better every time i play!
The contact also very good..
It is fun and didficul to collacet all the things in the game, and every time you can discover a new item! (this is the fun(:)
"
25259,"Fun game to play with friends. Wouldn't play it alone, though."
25260,It is very very very very very very very very very very fun. It is especially fun to play with friends. 10/10
25261,still as fun as ever after all these years
25262,This game is actually a game my friend Carl can run without dying so this is a really good game.

There are multiple characters to unlock and 99 levels to max out, making it a game you can spend some time with.

25310,"As a 1 player game? Its a boring no skill button masher not worth really of bothering with
when the market is filled with an amazing beat-em up games, both fun in single player mode
and multiplayer mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a 2-4 player co-op game with random people found during in game matchmaking?
Don't even bother. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a 2-4 player co-op game with your friends while using Discord call?
Its ok'ish, depending on your pain and tolerance on weak beat-em ups and cringe jokes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an overall beatem-up game? It's beyond horrible. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no build up for next locations, bosses and enemies. 
I'ts just pure ""haha wacky randomness is happeninng with random background and random characters"" with more shallow gameplay than Streets of Rage 1 and ton of cringe level of jokes.
And by ton I mean a TON.
Poop? Check. 
Burps? Check. 
Vomiting? Check. 
Pis*ing? Check.
It's like the the whole game was made by bunch of drunk sixth-graders.
This could get passed as a free flash game for kids in 2005 but today as a paid product? Eeeee.....no thanks.

The game is around 7 hour long, a bit longer with few optional areas. 
You can unlock tons of characters some with different magic attack and some being a copy paste with just a different skin. 
There is a replayability but why would you even bother playing this game more than once to be honest when the core gameplay is so dull and annoying.

About gameplay itself? You just go forward and mash X to win without any tactic as long as its not a boss. 
It's way more brain dead than any beat-em up I did EVER played over the past three decades.
Even original Streets of Rage 1 released on Sega Genesis in 1991 had more gameplay depth than Castle Crashers.

There is RPG system (when you level up you can upgrade melee damage, magic damage, defense or bow damage) and few ""combos"" (even tho button mashing is still the fastest and most efficent tactic of killing litteraly anything in this game).

Bow and spells are used on range but at the end mashing X button (attack) is still the best strategy in whole game and its dealing way more damage per second than even fully upgraded bow or magic.

There is a lot of characters to play but you cannot just swap them for fun betwen levels (because why WOULD anyone WANT that, am I right?) 
because they are on lower character level and that means you need to grind a LOT to reach them to useable level.

Also speaking of grind, y'know how to make getting experience points in a beat-em up game with RPG elements more annoying?
Well, experience points is a fixed number and its based around amount of hits you do on enemy, doesn't matter amount of damage or types of enemies you fight.

So basically upgrading your overall damage makes you level up way slower because you will deal less hits to the enemy before it will die 
and you will get way less experience points by doing that.
Sounds like a FUN system, right?

There also bunch of different looking weapons acting the exactly same way with barely noticeable stat differences and animal companions that also have barely noticeable effect in battle (with exceptions of few that are no brainer in using them over others).

Sometimes there are minigames or small gameplay variety or sudden PVP moments but as you can imagine probably - most of all those sucks balls DEEP.

For example: riding a deer while running away from a giant cat feels and controls like crap combined with way too fast screen scrolling and the fact that only 40% of the screen is usuable.
Swimming is beyond horrible due slow down and limiting what your character can do during combat. 
PVP is busted due RPG level difference, dull combat mechanics 
and rest of minigames are far worse than in first 4 Mario Party games.

This perfectly does show that those gameplay variety moments are really pi*s poor thought out.

For a ""beat-em up"" game aspect - this is a very, very boring, button mashing experience while being easy stun locked into infinity. 
If 3 enemies are attacking you at once, you are basically dead.

Checkpoints are very rare and far away from each other probably due focus on co-op aspect of this game. 
(That's one of main reasons why playing this game solo sucks. The game is not balanced for solo mode at all).

So because its a co-op oriented game, you can revive your fallen teammates making it easier to survive too......as long as it's not in the heat of battle because a minigame you have to do is ultra garbage - it takes around 2-4 second of QTE and a single hit at you will cancel whole process because of course it will.
 
Performing said minigame better will effect in reviving a teammate with more health but that also means it will probably take longer to revive him so it's not something that will happen in the heat of battle.

As I did mention before, this game have a very basic combo system but its mostly about button mashing and hoping that your character level is high enough just so enemies won't end up being a massive damage sponges killing you in 3-4 swings. 

At the end no matter what you will do or how high your level is - you will get stunlocked into infinity at one point anyway. 
And boy - any I mean ANY hit will make you waste your time on watching that absurdly long and annoying ""getting-up-from-the-ground"" animation. 
But the worst thing that can happen is being stun locked by low level enemies because it will take FOREVER for you to die.

Even tho I like other games of this developer and I like a lot animation artstyle of Castle Crasher, it's really hard to recommend this game for me because to be honest, artstyle is the only good thing about this game. Well, the soundtrack is good too I guess.
.....for the most of time at least.......ok, 50% of the time.

I recommend this game only for people that search for brainless ""haha another poop joke"" button mashing games.

There are far better beat-em up games on Steam and tons of those released over the past 2 decades on multiple gaming platforms while Castle Crashers feels like a 3DO exclusive.

I don't know like you but to be honest I rather play any of those other games after finishing Castle Crashers with my friends.

If you are even the smallest fan of this genre, do yourself a favor and don't even bother with Castle Crashers.

Instead try one of those amazing beat-em up games:

Streets of Rage 4,
Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara,
Fight'N Rage,
Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle,
The TakeOver,
Mother Russia Bleeds,
River City Girls,
River City Ransom Underground,
Double Dragon: Neon,
Big Action Mega Fight!,
Way of the Passive Fist,
Aztez.

Final note:
This is the last time I did bought a video game after watching a random ""funny"" Youtube video about it. 
From this day I am going to do extensive research about every single video game before buying it no matter what.
Thank you Castle Crashers for teaching me that kind of lesson.
At least one good thing came out of this game...."
25311,"IT WAS ASWOMEEEE

"
25312,Hay lắm
25313,"My girlfriend and i love this game. We were looking for a co-op game and finally found Castle Crashers! Nice animations, great storyline...simple and great."
25314,fun and great time killing games
25315,"I first played this game on the Xbox 360 and I have just loved the game ever since. I obviously have done a lot with the game, considering that I have over 300 hours in it.

[b]Gameplay[/b]

The gameplay is absolutely perfect. The arena asset of it where you must kill every enemy before you proceed is very fitting for a game like this. The enemy AI is also great, as they seem to get more agressive as you progress more through the game, and then once you beat the game, you have the option of doing it all over again, but with a brutally difficult twist where almost all of the enemies get nearly x10 health, damage, and everything.

Playing with another friend is highly recommended for this game, simply because it's just one of those games that's better with friends, however I would say the only fault with it is when there's connection problems, causing the entire game to just pause to let the other players catch up. The difficulty in general is great and increases at the perfect rate, the ending of the game is actually nice and hard, even on Insane Mode it's probably one of the most difficult things in the entire game once you get at the end, but it feels good to beat it once you kill that damn Necromancer.

[b]The Story[/b]

I find the story of this game comedic and silly, while it still gives a clear representation of what is going on and what you must achieve in the end. The ending does feel very rewarding and it makes you realize how big of a thing it is that you're at the end of the game. With how everything is set up in the story, it makes you realize that it's a long and difficult journey to save the princesses.

[b]Content[/b]

This game has so much content in it just as you play it. By how fun the game is, and the fact that you unlock a new character for each time you beat it, you'll see yourself constantly beating the game over and over again, unlocking all the new characters, new swords, and all of the animal orbs. There is also the two DLC characters that most players might end up buying, or at least the Pink Knight because who doesn't want a character that murders their enemies with rainbows and love on the field?

Simply a great game that has so many reasons to play again and again, whether by yourself or with a full party."
25316,Awsome game. Really fun to play with mates!
25317,"Ultimate party game. Best played with friends, but not totally unplayable by yourself."
25318,Very funny and good game!
25319,This is one of the most creative games I have ever played.  I've played through it multiple times and it still manages to be both hillarious and fun.  If you have time I would definately reccomend picking up a copy of this brilliant game.
25320,best game ever
25321,this game is very good but my friends started an hour before me and i was very sad.
25322,"This game so far has been nothing but fun. If you have friends, then you can have a blast with the amazing multiplayer and if not then the singleplayer is still good. All in all Great game!"
25323,A pretty cool game. Fun playing Local
25324,It's a fun and silly brawler game that has good multiplayer. The cartoon graphics really makes the game.
25325,"Its a fun game, especially with friends. Would reccomend it if you're gonna play with your friends!"
25326,"This isn't a game I could really experience to its fullest.  This is undoubtadly a co-op game.  

Castle Clashers is a fun old style arcade game; however, it isn't made for a single player playthrough. I gave it a shot and could appreciate what was there.

If it looks like fun AND you have someone to play with, go for it. If its just you, this is not the arcade game for you.

7/10"
25327,Just download it ... It's too good for words.
25328,so gud game get pls me god
25329,Still bnetter than No Man's Sky
25330,fun game cannot stop playing XD
25331,"Love it.


Nuff said"
25332,graet game 10X better when played with friends not a great solo game
25333,"A rather funny but good beat-em-up game, which gives you high quality gameplay for just a few bucks.
A solid experience and a lot of fun to play with friends. As a side note, I really recommend using a controller to play this game because it is a console port and the keyboard and mouse controls are awful.

Metacritic:
tbd / 100 Metascore
7.8 / 10 User Score"
25334,if you dont have this get (or a life) cus you can only choose one
25335,A cute fun game but not worth $14.99. I got mine free from a friend.
25336,This game is damn good! worth the buy and over 1 million hours of play! do it!
25337,"Jimmies=Rustled


This is a hardcore game disquised as a casual game.  Buggy as fuck.  Retarded hard.  Incredibly frustrating.  Don't buy if you're not MLG pro."
25338,Great fun multiplayer and decent single player.  My only criticism would be that it's a little on the short side.  Played through the whole game in a single night with some friends.  It has decent replayability and fun battle modes and extras.
25339,Poop jokes
25340,I have played fo years and years. will never get tired of lol roflcpter deez noots
25341,Better Co Op Game...
25342,This is fun.
25343,good game fun and bloody
25344,Impossible to play by yourself
25345,"WTF
Awesome... the best multiplayer game"
25346,"Great game, lots of fun, played best with friends. (online multiplayer is bad)"
25347,It's better on console. Believe me.
25348,10/10
25349,good game to play with friend or solo but better with friends
25350,good game
25351,"Castle Crashers is a simple yet compelling game. The story is straightforward, and the game is easy to pick up and play. The crisp art design really makes the game shine. The sound is really good, and because of its broad varieties, it makes each level look unique. There are multiple characters to unlock and 99 levels to max out, making it a game you can spend some serious time with. The campaign might be short but the experience is fun."
25352,"This game is so fun! I had a really good time playing it, and I want to say why.
You can start out as 4 different characters (Or if you buy DLCS) which are poison, fire, ice, and lightning. You can level up their strength, magic ability, agility, and defense. The game itself is actually pretty funny,  and I love the animation style. Also, each time you win the game as a character, you get a new character! And if you play as that new character, you get another new character! You can also level them up too. And once you beat the game, there is an insane mode, which is pretty hard, but you can get some pretty cool characters from beating it. The story is awesome, and this is why I recommend this game. This is probably my favorite steam game. Thank you for reading this."
25353,hard to stop playing this game. addictive gameplay and extreme replayability!
25354,nice
25355,"This game is just a simple sidescroller with barebones rpg elements, but it works - this is a perfect form of this genre.
If you want a little blast from the plast mixed with some new, you cant go wrong with this game... After such a long time I have had a ton of fun playing through this multiple times.

Pros:

+Music
+Intuative controls (360 / XB1 Pad reccomended)
+Funny and simple art design

Cons: 

-Can be grindish without a co-op partner
-Some bosses are just cheap and unimaginative 
-Co-op feels like a requirement at some points in the game (I did a playthrough with a Co-Op partner my first time around on steam, now on another playthrough some parts seem so much harder.)

I don't think this game is for everyone, to me it is a perfect game to end a long day with - easy to get into / not that frustrating -- Just simple. 
"
25356,"Very fun game to play with friends, as every game from The Behemoth."
25357,its ok (wink wink) i don't play that much (i have lvl 99 red knight and lvl 99 pink knight)
25358,Not enough content.
25359,"The single player modes are great, but no ones ever on the multiplayer ones(at least when I'm ever on). Would still recommend anyway,"
25360,This has been one of my favorite games since it was just a flashgame. I highly reccomend this if you are looking for some good laughs.
25361,nice
25362,bruh did they even crash the castle? awful game
25363,this game is amazing with friends.
25364,"Though my hours on here may not look like I've played the game much, I have played the Xbox 360 version for almost 160 hours and this game was good enough for me to get it on steam. Not only is this a great game with friends, but it's a great couch game for the family too. Hours of fun and laughs for days await you!"
25365,"Help me!
"
25366,"I simply loved this game. The art style and gameplay is that right blend of cool and fun. It reminds me of the games I would play at the arcade.
 
Pros: Lots of characters, fun, different game modes, split-screen multiplayer and online multiplayer, can play solo or with friends

Cons: Story mode is a bit short if you play for long periods of time, each character has an individual level so when you play multiplayer and someone chooses the character you leveled up many times you will NOT be able to select that character

I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves RPG-themed beat-em ups, although I beat the game in less than a day (spread throughout the week) I still find the game replayable over and over again"
25367,Hilarious! 10/10
25368,"This game. is just. SO FUN AND ENGAGING!

This game offers too much for its price. 15 dollars? This game is fantastic, and if you are thinking about buying it SMASH THAT BUY BUTTON SO HARD!! 

PROS:
Engaging

Fun

HIlarious

Fun to get each character

Not timed

Bosses are fun and challening

Weapons are great


CONS:

Bit time consuming

Bosses can be challenging for younger children

Not a lot of checkpoints

"
25369,"Only buy it if it's on sale, since the story mode is kind of short."
25370,"Its a good singleplayer game (though a bit repetitive), and a great game with friends."
25371,"Wish it had been more fun than it actually was. Played and beat the entire game in co-op, will never touch again."
25372,10/10 like Skyrim with guns
25373,Love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
25374,IT IS SHIT
25375,<3 very fun game to play with friends~
25376,"This game is AWESOME. Its fantastic. ""so y did u vote no on it den?"" Well... there is one reason that made it a no.

I love playing with people. This game is awesome, its idea is great ,and its kinda funny, however it is dead. I searched for the entire time I played for a open server, but no luck. If you really enjoy singleplayer, this game is the game for you. But its multiplayer unfortunatly died. It use to be my favorite game way back when on the xbox 360. It died... but it will always have a special place in my heart.

"
25377,"awesome
period"
25378,One of the most funny and cool game!!!
25379,"I love this game, I have played 24 hours in a few days without getting bored and without switching games."
25380,SO MUCH LULZ. <3
25381,"I can say this is one of the funnest multiplayer games for me and my family, the first time I played this was on Xbox 360.
I just turn off the gore because I have children around me."
25382,"For starters. This game is awesome. I love to play this with my brother and I am already level 99! This is a very enjoyable game that you can play with your friends and that you can use your mind to do what you want!
"
25383,"BEST GAME EVUR
Bought the Can't Stop Laughing Bundle recently on sale, because both CC (Castle Crashers) and BBT (BattleBlock Theater) are AMAZING. This game is super fun, it's hours of gameplay on just one gameplay, but you can play it many times to level up and unlock the MANY character this game has! (And to find all the orbs and swords, of course)
This is WAY FUNNER with friends though, so get that 4-player going, or just hop online with a random person (same goes for BBT)
10/10, especially with that ending"
25384,10/10 <3
25385,swords
25386,This is the first game I everplayed and I have to say it Is definetly a 10/10 game would play again
25387,"Good old co-op beat em' up.
Play with your friends for maximum LULZ"
25388,"Castle Crashers, a 2D beat 'em up by the guys at Newgrounds, is an Xbox arcade classic. It's an easy going game that mixes stylized artwork, comedy, and fun yet simple gameplay mechanics. It is also a great multiplayer game to play with your friends, and I would definitely reccommend this game to anyone who is generally interested in video games."
25389,"A fun beat 'em up game with a nice art style! Great when played in co-op.

I may have already played it too much on console, but the game does get repetative after a while. I have noticed that doing the air juggle combo over and over again always seems to be the best way to deal with normal enemies. You do have magic attacks that are pretty fun to use but I always felt that the physical attacks are much more effective in every situation.

But it usually goes for a low price during Steam sales, so I'd say it's worth the money.
If you are a fan of classic 2D beat 'em ups, try this game."
25390,"Castle Crashers, um jogo que tenho joguei a muito tempo, peguei todos os achiv e nunca avaliei

Ótimo game, ótima estória, acho esse jogo simplesmente incrivel, apesar de enjoar da cara dele depois de virado pela 3 vez. O melhor de tudo é que voce pode reunir mais 3 amigos e jogar até não aguentar mais ou se seus amigos não tiver grana para comprar, coloca uns controles e joga os 4 no mesmo PC, e em ultimo caso, de improviso, os 4 no mesmo teclado hahahhah 
Esse game tem os achiv mais raros que eu tenho (casos os leitores começar a caçar eles, vão deixar de ser raros, continuem preguiçosos) 
O bom é jogar com controle de xbox, pois não foi adaptado as imagens das teclas, por exemplo se for interagir com alguma coisa vai aparecer Y(controle) em vez de Z(teclado). Fora isso, muito bom. 

Recomendo"
25391,Amazing!
25392,"Lmfao while I was playing this game, my dad was making fun of me for playing a ""cartoon game"" and that I should play games that ""looked real""
Ok dad you don't know anything about games."
25393,nice
25394,the application crashes  then I lost my progress since i cannot save a game
25395,dead game
25396,boom
25397,10/10 just buy.
25398,"I Would get this Game For A Good Reason:
It Is Fun With 3 other people because it is"
25399,"super fun with a group of 2-4, classic side scrolling linear gameplay... hilarious editorials! Sword slashing fun!"
25400,"Great game for all ages, I recommend this to all, easy for let's plays with friends, great for completeionists, A++ 
Have fun :D Friend me too"
25401,I love it. so fun. 10/10 should get award for dankest story. lik if shrek lovs you
25402,Really fun game even if you're just playing singleplayer lots of weapons to pick from 3 2 classes (kinda) Archery and mage or warrior if you're with friends it get's 2x better
25403,"Honestly loved this game since i played it on xbox. If you have friends or want to make friends, i recommend this game! :)"
25404,awsome
25405,great game for freinds its 4 players its lots of fun and not for a high price they also have a website and sell lots of cool merch so be sure to if you like this game go check that out they have some really cool stuff
25406,"Honestly all I have to say is this is a steal when you buy it for $1!!! LOL it's so fun with friends and it never gets old but that's the key word... Friends.

no friends = boring 

friends = best game out there 

I rate this 7/10"
25407,"Tried a million times to get into CC, but keyboard play was meh at best. Now that I have my controller I can give this a full thumbs up. Great game."
25408,"Single or Co-op, it is crashing, smashing craziness fun for all."
25409,ye
25410,eh game. Don't buy unless you have friends.
25411,BEST GAME 10/10
25412,Idd stick my mentual in it!
25413,Pretty fun game. A few Waifu's as well! :)
25414,good meme
25415,"Simple, yet very fun."
25416,is good
25417,Fun game to play with friends.
25418,help me something hapend andi cant play castle crashers it says this Castle Crashers failed to start(error code 83)
25419,It's a good game but it gets boring really fast if you're on your own. In my opinion you need your friends to play with you just so it won't get repetitve as much as playing alone. Otherwise it's a pretty good game.
25420,This game is good but too few ppl play online so lonely:(
25421,I like this game its very entertaining
25422,"Really decent game, it's not a game that you will seat for hours and hours but for a moment it's great"
25423,"I havent played much yet but I made an owl and a deer shit themselves so I gotta say its a 10/10, I also battled my friend for the princess's love, I emerged victorious."
25424,"The unique drawing style is fun to watch. It is a bit short though. I finished the game in 8 hours but given the price this is fine.

At times though the game gets chaotic because there is so much going on. 
There is no highlight of where your hero is nor does the view center. This makes the game very hard at times. 
Also don't play when you tend to have epileptic seizures. 

"
25425,What a beautiful game.
25426,castle crashers is an instant classic. a must have game in my opinion. i may have not many hours on steam with it but i played it for like ever on the xbox back in time.
25427,What's better than killing enemies? Playing tennis with their corpse with friends!
25428,The game totally worth it! Pay 15 bucks for hours and hours of fun
25429,This game is fun there is blood but you can turn that off
25430,"Love the game, rly rly rly fun :d"
25431,"Castle crushers is hack and slash. A hack and slash with the most repetitive combat system i have ever come across. The only things you can do are fast attack and strong attack, over and over and over again. Its boring after and hour. The classes of warriors don't change the gameplay one bit, and the progression system is boring, passive upgrades. There is nothing to keep me interested or entertained. This game is not worth your money"
25432,"dank game, dank meme, dank life"
25433,good game.
25434,Fun and rage inducing
25435,"I bought this game while it was on sale for 5$. Wow it was worth my money. This game has an epic storyline, amazing characters, and addicting gameplay that kept me coming back for more and more. I am aware I do not have many hours on this account, which is because I played most of my time of this game on an old xbox 360, on which I have over 300 hours. I beat this game by myself, with friends, and with new characters, and overall this is probably one of my favorite games of all time. Definitely worth the money."
25436,One of the best games I've ever played !!
25437,vive castlle crasher
25438,best game 11/10
25439,Good Game! :)
25440,ok
25441,"""The most intense joke in the universe"" I once said, when I watched the trailer. Boy, do I feel like an idiot now. This game is AMAZING, while it's still MUCH better with local multiplayer, single player is still VERY fun, and I recommend this game to anyone who wants an action adventure beat-em-up. Do yourself a favor and get this game. oh yeah, get a gamepad/controller aand this game is much more fun as well. Final opinion, The most intense comedy in the universe."
25442,good game lol gay
25443,ye
25444,"best of all time
funny and overall awsome
"
25445,I really like this game i got it for a gift one year and put 30 hours in it if i needed to i would rebuy on steam. :)

25454,I managed too snag this gem while on sale but it is worth the $15.00 price tag
25455,good game
25456,"IT'S SO FUN THAT I BEAT IT TWICE ON XBOX 360 AND I WANT TO BEAT IT ON MY PC NOW!!
OVER 9000/5 IGN CONFIRMED"
25457,"This game restricts the player's choice. When you finish a level, there is a part where you choose to upgrade your strength/defense/agility and others. Since I am one who prefers to max my damage solely, I chose to just increase damage and not agility or defense or any other skills. So then i proceeded with the gameplay only to realise that I can't proceed. Why is that so? Because after a weapon was dropped by an enemy, I then pick it up and my speed tremendously decreased. It was not just any speed limits, It is the limitation that does not allow you to get off a high ground, which is why I could not proceed with the gameplay as I was stuck on the hill. The game forces you to increase agility even if you do not want to. I mean there are ways to slow my character down but not to the point whereby the game is unplayable. It can affect my attack speed, my movement speed, the time it takes for mana to charge. Anything is possible but guess what? The developer just wants to ruin your money and your day :) by not allowing you to move at all. So lesson learnt from this game is that: We should all increase each and every skill, be it strength defense agility. It is a MUST to increase ALL, No strategy and No personal preference, You are to be forced to play according to the developer's choice."

25491,best game ever super fun to play on your own and with friend
25492,I RELLY RECOMENDING THIS GAME FOR EVERY ONE HOW WANTED TO BUY BECAUSE IT'S FUN AND CHALLENGING
25493,"[h1][b]THE GOOD[/b][/h1]

 +Crisp art design really makes the game shine
 +Multiple game modes are fun to play with friends or alone
 +Eclectic original soundtrack makes each level feel unique
 +Boss fights entertain as much as they challenge
 +Genuinely amusing sense of humor

[h1][b]THE BAD[/b][/h1]
 -Online connection issues handicap the multiplayer experience
 -Not as many features as you'd hope for

[h1][b]SCORE: 8/10[/b][/h1]"
25494,"Castle Crashers is an amazing game. I first played it on xBox 360, 3 or 4 years ago, and now I have got it on PC I am now newly hooked. The art style is great- it has inspired me to draw some of the great characters."
25495,Castle Crashers with gamepads and friends is A LOT OF FUN!!!
25496,"Everything about this game is great, except there are few glitches you can exploit. I feel like one problem with the game is that nobody plays the multiplayer anymore, so you can't play online with random people. Me and my friends all enjoyed the game.

10/10 189 hours in the game."
25497,A Great Button Mashing Marathon
25498,"I don't quite understand why this game has so many positive reviews. The combat system feels very off and badly timed, the art is a big letdown and items disappear way too quick after boss fights, you might not even be able to pick it all up if you aren't fast enough. A game mechanic that I don't really feel adds anything to the game, you just get frustrated when the items disappear and you didn't get to pick it all up after a hard boss fight with combat patterns that are impossible to dodge in some cases because of the dull combat system that is implemented. 

I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this game even if it's on sale, it just feels just like a browser game you might aswell have played for free."
25499,Im new this game just started playing in  2016 best game ever 10/10

25515,"This is an amazing game. I've never gotten bored with it, and I've restarted it many times. I love it, it's well worth the 15 dollars"
25516,"I had a well thought out review but I'm just lazy and I ate chicken...
In short: 
Game -> candy

This game is a lot of fun to play with friends. I was introduced to the game through some friends and loved it. Then I got my girlfriend hooked on it and we played through the game several times and we loved every minute of it. 

The only negative thing I could say is that it might seem repetitive at times [spoiler]especially during insane mode[/spoiler] but maybe that's just because I've played a lot of the game.

Overall I would totally recommend this game to you and your friends, or if you don't have friends, it's still a lot of fun.
Plus charitable devs and all that"
25519,"yup, it's gewd"
25520,is just so awsome
25521,This game is super dope. Best played with friends.
25522,has a genesis era feel with the graphics of an acid trip whats not to love?

25528,"This game is great a lot of vareity in enemies and weapons and a very fun multiplayer.

The only criticism i have for this game is that enemies can stun lock you untill you die.

8/10"
25529,"It's a fun time, but it gets better the more people playing with you,"
25530,Awesome Game 10/10 I just have one issue why can i never find a online lobby
25531,"Très bon jeu entre pote.
Histoire drôle mais dommage il y a des petits problèmes avec certaines manettes et le jeu est pas ergonomique au clavier."
25532,"Overall, its a great game. It reminds me of those old Flash cartoons you'd see on Newgrounds, but it still has a few problems. One of the biggest is with online multiplayer. The game constantly stutters, freezes up, and has many latency issues that have yet to be fixed. The stuttering and lag can make the game unplayable. The game is simple beat-em-up with some amazing levels and can be pretty challenging at times. I recommend this game for people looking for a solid beat-em-up to play with friends, but only on local. The game has many problems with online play as stated before."
25533,Bad
25534,It's a fun  game to play with your friends

25558,"1st of All Red Knight Sucks, ""color doesn't mean jackshit"" but for real i love red knight, this is a great game and you'll want to kill yourself after beating insane mode with friends. if you want to read the ultimate castle crasher fedora man, go to this link and read the comments by Aichomancer, holy feces. This person is the lamest person on the internet, repeat Aichomancer follow this link or go to castle crashers wiki on the red knight page. 

http://castlecrashers.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Knight

trust me, this guy is sad but will make you laugh."
25559,I remember beating this game multiple times on my cousin's PS3. Bought it on PC and still come back to it every once in awhile for another playthrough.
25560,Cartoon graphics and a bizarre story. Coupled with fun Beat em up gameplay and you get Castle Crashers. Overall a great game to play and mess around with friends
25561,"Love the goofy humor, love the graphics, love the gameplay. It is simple enough to pick up but not too simple to make you lose interest. A fun game to chill to if you don't feel like using your brain after a whole day of work/study, like what they say, just whack the heck outta everything. Each boss and level has its own mechanics, which makes the game refreshing as you progress. Not to mention, tons of weapons/pets for you to dig out or blast them out with some explosives.

If you have another friend/partner/companion/anyone who enjoys diarrhea bambi kinda humor, explore together, it will be EVEN more fun."
25562,"I've owned this game on 3 different platforms. Progression is great single player or multiplayer. It's really easy to get into and you mostly just cooperate throughout, except for a FEW moments. Me and my friends had fun with the minigame in this, where you avoid cutout stand enemies with your cutout stand character. It gets hectic, and we were all yelling and laughing. Definitely recommend this for local or online co-op."
25563,"Great Multiplayer game. Amazing if you jsut want to play a fast-pace, entertaining game with stupid (but hilarious) jokes in it."
25564,"Fun game, Hilarious facial expressions, moments where you go ""What...?"" and toads.
Classic game to play."
25565,"One of the best games to play with friends. Creative moves, good humor. Lots of fun."
25566,GR8 GAME
25567," Great game, tons of replay value, i would get this if you dont have it already <3"
25568,"So much fun. Timeless. 

Still awesome in 2017."
25569,This is a game that has pooping deer need I say anymore about this game?
25570,Nice game to play with friends and enjoy the moment
25571,This game is great to play with friends
25572,"One of the best games to play with a group of friends. Worth the price, even when not on sale."
25573,"One of the funniest games, great story and game play. Excellent music. The game doesn't get old and you can play it over and over with new characters. There's always something to find."
25574,Use a controller and maybe a friendo and you'll be set for a good time
25575,Absoloodle amazing. Flawless everything.
25576,"Castle Crashers is a game you need if you're looking for a good multiplayer game. With cartoon-ish graphics and an exciting  battle system, it's an overall good time. And if you beat the game, there are minigames and items to unlock, giving more playtime for this game."
25577,Just go play it
25578,10/10 would review again  for a badge
25579,"Eight years on, and this game is still king of sidescrolling ARPGs. The game never loses it's snappy action with intuitive controls, high pace, brilliant art style, and constantly impressive array of items, enemies, levels and humor. I can't imagine there's anyone left out there that doesn't own this game. But, if that's you, hop on board, 'cause this train's a bullet."
25580,Streets of Rage for the Newgrounds generation.
25581,fun game
25582,"Do yourself a favour, get 3 friends and play all day long. This game has provided me of with so much fun with friends. I played it on PS3 and I rebought it on steam to once again play it with friends who own it on here. The game is jst pure fun. the mechanics require skill and in the higher difficulty button mashing will kill you. There's nothing mroe satisfying than hamering enemies to the floor and flying in the air, taking them with you. Even if the characters aren't completely different from one another they do have some tweaks that make you feel like you're not jt getting a simple skin change.

Do yourself a favour and buy this game."
25583,"It's $3, just get it, man!"
25584,Super fun and addictive
25585,"This is game is so replayable dude, its not even funny.

Get your friends! Get your friends' friends!

25592,"Played this game on xbox as a kid, loved it. Bought it for PC, still loved it. Fun game to casually play."
25593,"So , this game is just epic , I have to say , it worth to buy it , I recommend you to play it with some friends .
The story is fun , the gameplay as well , it also has a lot of Boss battles ( and some of them are funny )
And you can unlock a lot of characters , it's not just the 4 Brave Knights , you can play as a Villain , the King , and other Allies. Each character has different magics .

I recommend you to buy this game now , and tell your friends about it ! 
:D"
25594,I've been playing this game for years and its always fun to come back to.
25595,"Play this game if you want to laugh, ""the one more level word"", amazing multiplayer,  animals that are pure hilarious and cuteness - fluffyness you wanna die... DO IT NOW!... oh and Challenging yes that's an important word here ;D"
25596,It doesn't matter what platform you play this game on. It rocks!
25597,It's cool
25598,"My brother love to play this game with me. It was fun to play the game together.
(300 hours later and the game is aight)"
25599,fun game to play with friends :)
25600,Fun game if you like medieval stuff
25601,"Absolutly delicious and funny with friends, full of humour and stubidity, as much as brawl"
25602,"game was fun when i was 12



Game still fun and im now 16 buy this game."
25603,Love can change a man.
25604,"The most fun game ever made. Quite enjoy it especially with friends, the support for Local Play and Hot seat with 4 players makes this perfect for your homies"
25605,"i love this game a lot. i bought this with battle block theater. is there any similar games that i can buy? cuz i reli enjoy these type of games
"
25606,Taught me that archers in any difficult video game are awful. 11/10 best game.
25607,"I played this game for the first time on Xbox 360.  I loved it!  Finding it on here made my day!  The humor in this game is terrific and the visuals are great.  I love using the magic for each player class just to see what cool effects they have.  This game is definitely worth it, I recommend giving it a try!"
25608,"Used to play this tons on the XBOX when I had one, this game is fun and full of laughs!"
25609,Definitley on my top 5 games list
25610,"Never stops being fun, will always recommend."
25611,We recommend the L2 trigger.
25612,"Super fun, best 2D game I've played in a long time.
"
25613,this game is like being able to suck your own dick..... its great
25614,"Played on 360 orginally and got on pc a while back. Great beat 'em up reminiscent of the old double dragon
games + magic. Played 360 version for 100+ hours and I keep coming back for more thanks to the 4 player co-op."
25615,This game is super good. I played it with a team of 4 through practically the whole game and it was so much fun. Definitely get for a fun game by yourself or with friends. (Playing with friends makes the game like 100 times better)
25616,"This game is great. Doesn't matter if you have 20 minutes, or a few hours, if you enjoy arcade hack and slash games definitely can't go wrong with Castle Crashers!"
25617,This game is hella fun if oyu have friends. 7/10
25618,"A great hack-and-slash coop! You can join up with 3 friends in local and online coop and rain hell on your enemies with 4 powers, strength, magic, defense, and agility! There's a load of unlockable characters that keep you playing, the game is tons of fun alone or with friends, and its got plenty of replay value to it. Simple, casual gameplay that is rarely frustrating, and a great port for a console. The only downside is the controls without a console controller, but you can always remap them as you'd want in the settings. The younger me will never forget hours of this on Xbox Live."
25619,Sandwiches make you strong. Enough said.
25620,"10/10 with friends, never gets old. ONe of the only games i keep coming back to over the years."
25621,"Played this through on xbox and got it on PC. 
Combat consists of mashing buttons, but the button-mashing is satisfying because you can feel the impact of the attacks and spells.
Story is silly and funny but has a sense of progression. No extreme lore is present.
Soundtrack is great, lots of variety.
Boss fights are creative but narrow down to nailing a tactic and abusing it until the boss dies.
The game recommends a controller and is completely correct in this. Playing on keyboard feels clunkier for this game in comparison to a controller.

15 euros is a bit too high for this game in my opinion, wait for a sale where it goes down to 10 euro or less. I got it for 1 or 2 euro during this year's summer sale.

Would I recommend? Yes."
25622,Best game ever made
25623,"Really good game, brought lots of happy memories between my friends and I"
25624,"Fun, addictive and challenging game, especially when played with friends."
25625,"I will always come back to you Castle Crashers.
You remain one of the best games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.

Never change."
25626,god
25627,"It's a button mashing, mob killing, boss slaying, money bag grabbing free-for-all with comrades who help you out in the beginning only to backstab you at the end for a princess' kiss.There's minigames as well I suppose."
25628,"Disclaimer: Even though I don't have a ton of hours into this game, I've played it a ton on my xbox 360.

For the insane discounts this game goes on sometimes, I think it's a must buy for people who love indie games. It is a hack n' slash, but they do have various mini games to add variety. I can't say much as to how well it plays on pc, although I will mention that they do allow you to remap the pc control scheme (yay!) to your liking as well as having controller support. They also have a large character pool, and every character (for the most part) feels different and sometimes even has a different move set. Overall, great game!"
25629,Amazingly fun game!!!
25630,I had so much fun watching my friend play this game while I was dead on the ground
25631,its an epic party game ;)
25632,"I married the clown,is fucking awesome."
25633,"Big local mutliplayer fun.

25635,"This game is one of the best games I ever have played, I have played it several times and with several people and I have never been disappointed."
25636,Super amazing game!

25640,"Silly, easy to pick up, and loads of fun."
25641,"Good coop multiplayer fun.

I play with my daughter, the potty humor is fun for all ages!"
25642,This game is great. Takes literally 30 seconds to install and you can run at 60 god with the worst computer.also making servers to play with friends is SUPER easy
25643,prety good for a saturday night with friends :D
25644,cool game with friends !
25645,its fun
25646,"Some great fun, if you play it together with friends. Strange kind of humor, but funny."
25647,"Short and sweet, throughougly awesome when played in 3 or 4 player co-op.

All hail Tom Fulp!"
25648,"Great 4 player beat em up game in old skool style!
Funny graphics and animation which give the game its own unique flavor.
I do recommend a joypad though with a keyboard it is not so much fun.
Excellent value for it's price!
"
25649,"Pretty fun party game and challenging enough.
5/7"
25650,An arcade side scoller fighting game. It is a ton of fun to play. You have plenty of goofy bosses to fight and hordes upon hordes of enemies to fight. This game is pretty good playing it solo but it truly shines when played co-op.
25651,"I bought this game in 2008. We only had 2 Xbox controllers. Had to buy more. I played it with my little brother and sister for hours and for days. We'd come back to it every now and then and play through it again. One day, I was lucy enough to get one of the DLC codes the behemoth gave out for free on twitter. We played several more times. As we all wanted to level up the same new character.

I bought this game in 2010 for the PS3 the day it came out. I played through it quickly [by myself, as it was a school night] and won a chicken [stress toy] among other prizes from the Behemoth themselves. I accidently tore the letter of recognition when I opened it. 

I slapped the vinyl decal of the orange princess on the side of my computer and bought the steam version during a steam sale. WE PLAYED IT AGAIN!

My only regret is that we have never beaten hard mode.

Oh look. I haven't even reveiwed the game's content. And yet I have said enough that you're not beefy enough to break my wall of text."

25666,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
25667,This game is extremely fun! Even more so when playing with friends! Well worth the money!
25668,Fun game to play especially with friends I've replayed so many times just to unlock new characters and I never get bored
25669,"Playing solo can get sort of boring, definitely play with friends"
25670,Chaotic coop fun
25671,"Great game that's still fun to play today, especially if you get some friends together for co-op."

25673,Game's fun for a little while
25674,"I spent hours playing this on Xbox and the PC port, with a controller, is just as amazing."
25675,"Hands down one of the best multiplayer games I've ever played. The storyline is quirky and the characters have a lot of life to them. It is easy enough that anyone can play it, but still has enough depth to be enjoyed by gamers of all skill levels. I highly recommend this (and Behemoth's other fantastic multiplayer, Battleblock Theater) to anyone who is looking for a fun, easy-going multiplayer game."
25676,that ending was a tear jerker.

25682,Truly the best party game I ever played at sleepovers during my childhood!
25683,Funny and original game
25684,"Castle crashers is a game that you can tell the developers really wanted to make. This game oozes newgrounds energy and it's a pretty fun beat-em-up with a levelling system and multiplayer. Great game to play through with friends, and it's a great time solo too.
9/10"
25685,THE BEST GAME OF THE WEEK
25686,9/11 good game
25687,"The behemoth hasnt made a bad game yet and this is one of their best...out of their 4. They have a ton of variety for their games, and this is my favorite beat 'em up of all time. If you like games like battle toads, and rpgs then you will love combonation of the two genres. You can invest a LOT of time into it. It has an rpg  level up style, but a gameplay style of a beat 'em up. Great with friends, very good humor, and goes on sale cheap...often...why are you still reading these reviews? Its a Fantastic game! buy it!"
25688,"Surprisingly fun, I didn't think I would like it until my younger brothers made me play it. You have to stay up all night finishing it. Fun with friends and the fam."
25689,"Best co-op beat'em up ever. Great combos, magic & humor."
25690,"Castle Crashers is a great game for hardcore and casual gamers alike.  The Behemoth took everything that made classics like Golden Axe, Double Dragon and Battletoads great and modernized it.  It feels classic and yet fresh from the first time you pick it up.  The gameplay is solid and very fun solo or with friends.  The story mode is quite lengthy for a game of this genre, but thanks to varied enemy types, locales and creative boss battles it never feels tedious.  Multiplayer can be local, online or a mix of both.  You can play the co-op story mode or other versus mini games with friends.  What really grabs you about this game (or any Behemoth game, really) is that it is just dripping with charm and humor from start to finish.  That combined with incredible replayability thanks to collectables like new characters, weapons and animal orbs will keep you playing over and over.

I loved this game from launch and the recent remaster made it even better.  Most notable impovements are the increased resolution, uncapped framerate and ""Back Off Barbarian"" mini game.  Some people were disappointed that B.O.B. replaced ""All You Can Quaff"", but this didn't detract from the overall experience in anyway for me.   A.Y.C.Q. seemed like a lazy add-on anyway.  Kudos to the developer for upgrading all current owners of the game for free.  If you are a PC gamer, you absolutely must have this game in your library.  It is amazing and if you catch a Steam holiday sale you can grab it for $2.99."
25691,Juego Chido :P
25692,I somehow still play this game and i honeslty wish something new could come but its a very low chance sadly.
25693,"Amazing plataformer, awesome for couch multiplayer (also has online MP)."
25694,"Note:  I played and beat this game on Xbox360 with friends, and we had a good time.

If you aren't going to play with friends, I sincerely recommend AGAINST this game, as it's nearly unplayable without backup.  You cannot hit enemies while they are down for some reason, but that doesn't stop them from stun-locking you to death.  Seriously, you will get hit and go flying into a group of enemies and they will play tennis with your body until you die and there is -NOTHING- you can do about it.  Nothing.  Other than start over and watch the same completely unskippable cut scenes over and over and over, until you want to break your controller from being forced to watch them.  It's not just limited to boss fights either.  Every encounter is like this.  2 or 3 levels in, when you're in the woods and you're just getting knocked down over and over by an endless rain of arrows from all sides, you're going to wonder why you're playing.  When the boss from the woods spits out an endless number of minions and they use you like a volley ball, and it doesn't matter what you do, they'll attack you while they're being hit, and it's stun-lock-insta-death time again, that's when you'll just quitely uninstall the game that you're regretting buying.

If you ARE going to play with friends, well good luck.  Every negative review on here is about how much trash the netcode is."
25695,"This game is really cool.
End of Story"
25696,I love it.
25697,"I replayed this the other day, and I have to say it is really fun especially playing it with a friend. Lots of laughs and good times to be had."
25698,"This game, alongside Battleblock, is a great way of passing the time until the release of Pit People."
25699,"Smash/cut/burn/electrocute/freeze/whatever massive amount of ennemies (sometimes friends too), run throught dynamic maps, saves princesses from crazy Bosses, and generally participate in huge battles of epic proportion when you cannot even find your player in the joyous mess.

This is a brilliant, cracked and hillarious game that need to be played with 3 other friends to maximise the fun intake! Buckle your seat and brace yourself because you are embarking for a hell of a ride!"
25700,Very good and intense game :D
25701,Fix the keyboard delay. Not recommended because if you have it on ultra/high settings no matter what FPS you get (I get 60) you will have delay when you try to move and it's almost unplayable.
25702,I love this game ! I have finish this game and ... it's so good ! Je le recommande :) (pour les bons joueurs qui veulent aller jusqu'a la fin du jeu ! Vraiment une aventure palpitante :D !
25703,This game is a perfect time waster.

"
25705,Amazingly fun with friends
25706,"This game is definitely the best game you could ever buy.
Great for teenagers and little kids.  Welcome to the world of kid friendly games with awesome graphics.
A very funny story line with action and chivalry.  Just beat and bash these unfriendly hordes of barbarians,
groups of thieves, and hungry trolls.  Witness the grand storyline flashing back at you when you finally
defeat the evil wizard.

A great game with nice beats and music.  Recommended 10/10:  Love the Twisted Ending!"
25707,a freakn beaut
25708,"Pretty good game.

25709,this is best co-op game on the world
25710,"A great game made by great people.

Timeless arcade play with tons of unlockable characters, weapons, secrets, easter eggs, and more. 
Honestly one of the most fun games I've ever played - hundreds more hours on console than here.
"
25711,I play this with my kid.  The gameplay is interesting enough to keep me interested and simple enough for her to follow along.  There's a few little mini game varations too like arena combat and some chase scenes.
25712,Definitely a must have for anyone who loves a good co-op game.
25713,Amazing game with couple of friends.
25714,Good fun-Especially with friends
25715,"Castle Crashers, is and continues to be one of my go to games for playing with a bunch of people. If you want some fun light hearted play, definately pick this up.  Its a steal at its normal price, but a must buy when on sale!"
25716,Its pretty good i guess.
25717,This game is better than cheese.
25718,A good game kill your fd and fight for the kiss
25719,"Fantastic, fun co-op brawler! Perfect for playing with your partner!"
25720,"This game is funny and always is entertaining to play with a friend. Good, good game."
25721,"A fun and greatly enjoyable game to be played alone or with friends, Castle Crashers is hectic side-scrolling hack-and-slash type game with full controller support. Each of the numerous levels offers new set pieces, villains and rogues, unlockables, secrets, small mostly adorable pets and boss battles. Combine this will an upbeat and all round energetic soundtrack for easily accessible entertainment.

25762,Even though this game is a bit older you can still have alot of fun with friends.

Ce jeu est très prennant, surtout à plusieur, l'histoire est simple, et c'est très bien comme ça!
Un petit jeu où l'on avance dans une histoire déjantée avec des personnages déjantés!
Graphismes et gameplay impeccables!

Conclusion:
Génial à plusieurs, mais durée de vie limitée!

Cordialement,

This game is really addictive, mostly with friends, the storyline is simple, and that's really good like that!
A little game where you're progressing in a crazy storyline with crazy characters!

Score: 95/100"
25779,"I loved this game on the Xbox, but on the PC, the controls are terrible, and most of the DLC isn't available to PC players. If you buy this, make sure you have a controller and it's on sale."

25796,I fucking love this game. I have played since 14 on xbox. seeing that i have moved to pc i felt i must buy this. the only thing i dislike is how they set up the keyboard. but in 30 min you can find a good keyboard setup
25797,All you can quaff!
25798,"This game has become, and will stay my favorite game, for a long time to come."
25799,stands up very well to current arcadetype games considering how old it is :)
25800,"XD when i played this i was like WHAT THE HECK IS THIS WEIRD GAME!??!?!? XDDDDD it is so funny and good to play. hope others like it
EDIT: old me i want to shoot you
Edit 2021: both of you shut up"
25801,Great game. Nothing to say bout it.
25802,"Grab three friends and fight your way together through countless custom draw levels, competing for loot, searching for cute hidden animals, upgrade your stats, level up your magic, fight ninja pirates on the high seas, eat sandwiches that make you huge, gate crash a wedding, fight a giant sock puppet, fight your way to the end of the story and then survey the wreakage of your journey."
25803,Insane mode is great for ruining friendships 10/10

It's cute, fun, silly, and the best part is anyone can run it."

25809,"Very funny Coop Beat-em-Up 
it is great to play alone but with friends even more fun!"
25810,Amazing And Fun Game!!!
25811,Only doing this for the award

25813,"game's so fucking cool, yo uget to be knightmen™️  hitting barbarians and other men™️ like cyclpops; iceman™️  and more its coo"
25814,"One of the best games for couch co-op I've played to date.
Just remember to grab enough controllers for everyone since the game is not particularly keyboard-friendly."
25815,"I loved this game so much i finished it more the once, I have clocked 25 hours on it which is alright, it repeats itself alot in the game there is no real special moments but I still love this game, I would buy it anyday of the week."
25816,Always a classic.
25817,best co-op I can reccomend.
25818,whooooh dood
25819,"This game is incredible. I remember playing this games demo in 2012 on my ps3 over and over, hoping that one day I could get this game and enjoy the whole experience. It's been years since I finished my first playthrough, and I love every second of it. I played through with my friend and my sister and it was magical, especially the ending. This game wonderfully combines acade brawling, a level up system, and exploration. (I played this on ps3, hence the short playtime) I would rate this a 9/10, you bash a giant cat fish to death."
25820,Great game! Best Played with Friends!
25821,"Good single player, better with 2 people, even better with 4!!
"
25822,"The game with the weirdest animations I've ever played.  Diarrhea deers, what?  And that ending.  It's a great game to play with friends and easy to get too.  The game goes on sale often enough for $4 or sometimes even $2 and there's a 4 pack bundle.  I think the only downside is that there's not much left to do after beating the final stage.  At that point, you've seen everything there is to see in the game.  If people are still wanting to play, they end up grinding to raise their levels."
25823,This game is random funny and addicting but when it gets to some of the boss battles your pc sh^ts itself even if you have a good pc but still worth the buy
25824,"Se joga sozinho, Com amigos, Co-op, Versus, um pouco repetitivo, depois de 40 horas de jogo. MUITO BOM!"
25825,"This game is AMAZING.

I bought this game for a second time (first time on PS3) just to play it more often

While this game is significantly more fun with others, that doesnt mean you cant play alone and have just as much fun as i did. Not to mention that you can get a 4-pack of this game, for the price of 3. BUT WAIT! THERES MORE! Castle crashers is just one game from The Behemoth.

I would definitely recommend their other game 'Battleblock Theater' as well as this.

Mild spoiler:
[spoiler] By the way. Don't pick the orange princess[/spoiler]"
25826,"One of the best games ever, perfect to play with friends. Or alone, if you have none."
25827,A gem of a game. Make sure to play with friends to get the most enjoyement.
25828,A great beat em up to play with a friend.
25829,"If you don't own this classic yet, grab it!
Tons of fun for you and yours.
As a matter of fact check out the rest of The Behemoth's titles. (Alien Hominid not available on PC)"
25830,"By far the most hilarious, and entertaining game I've played"
25831,"My girlfriend and I just beat this game and it was an absolute pleasure to play through. Every level feels very hand crafted and unique. There are plenty of jokes and funny experiences for every sense of humor. The game is also provides some fantastic and diverse challenges. There are interesting characters around every corner and just when you think things can't get any more silly, they do. Overall a great game, although I can't recommend playing through it by yourself it is for sure great fun with friends!"
25832,AWESOME GAME NEVER GETS OLD 10/10
25833,King of couch multiplayer.
25834,4-player multiplayer fun. The Ram is the best animal orb.
25835,"When I first saw this game, I went like:' OMG, what is that? Tiny Cartoon man?"" when I play it, I realize this game is amazing"

25857,"An enjoyable game worth playing with friends, but it gets more stale the more you play it. Insane Mode does not help this"

25859,this is a tasty dildo bashing game if you are into that
25860,"Muy divertido y con una dificultad decente UwU

I love this shit"
25861,"Riding farm animals to victory or certain death, you'll have fun either way."
25862,Best plot twist I've ever seen
25863,"this is a very fun multiplayer game, ive spent hours playing it both solo and with friends i think it should win the steam award because its a great game and  the story and the weapon varties are very creative"
25864,"Castle Crashers® is a very fun game that'll get you going 'oh come on! Five more minutes!' It has a complex story line (sarcasm), and theres also an Arena to fight your friends. The other gamemode is just confusing, so don't even try it."
25865,"If you have a friend who want to buy this game too, buy it. Playing coop makes it worth each cent.

25869,Great game lots of fun with friends.
25870,"First game I really got into on steam, 13 year old me played this game all day and night. Great fun and co-op play, I highly recommend it."
25871,Tis but a scratch
25872,this game is awesome but you need to make much more levels
25873,"Stupid hence hilarious humor. Character level up! Up to 4 player on one screen. We can hit each other by ""mistake"".
Fun in solo as well.
We need more games like this."
25874,"Fun multiplayer action game that will keep you playing for many hours to reach the highest level, beat the campaign or beat your freinds high score in the little mini game Back off Barbarian!"
25875,"This game is exactly and all u need if u like this 2d scroll game.
Super Epic With Friends."
25876,This is a solid and fun game and i recommend it if you have a friend or two to play it with.
25877,one of the best couch coop games on PC
25878,Fun game
25879,"This game is really funny, and the multiplayer mode is fun. I've beat it seven times now. The story mode is fairly short - you can beat it in maybe seven hours - and it's not too difficult either. This game is also a good stress reliever because all you do is mash buttons. And the music is really good, Castle Crashers has one of the best game soundtracks I've heard."
25880,"A fun and relaxing game, great to play if friends, if I had any, that is."
25881,"This game is so cool! I love the artistry and graphics! This is one of the best ways to design a game; cute, funny, and with a little bit of rude humor... i give it a 10/10"
25882,Best game I ever bought for under 5 dollars.
25883,Just the best
25884,"What can I say that has not already been said?

One of the best beat'em up (with some rpg elements inside) in years.
Try the demo, if you don't laugh with it, you probably have a problem with you inner child ;)"
25885,"Amazing game, especially with 4 people, then it's total chaos. Sometimes you can't tell where you are, and that is actually kinda fun, surprisingly."
25886,"Rescuing princesses, while crashing castles - that's all I need."
25887,"It's a fast-paced, awesome adventure game. Lot of characters, weapons, and so on.














10/10 would die from bat swarm again"
25888,Best fun I ever had on xbox. Not lost its charm on pc ever since
25889,This game is very funny ^.^
25890,this game is a lot of fun :D
25891,"Castle Crashers is a fun 2D hack 'n' slash game that has you play as many different types of characters, including but not limitted to: The 4 Iconic Knights, A barbarian, A thief, and many others. This game is quite weird but very funny and enjoyable. There is both local and online multiplayer for those who want to work together through the game. Long story short Castle Crashers is a wacky yet funny hack 'n' slash game with crude humor, weird story, and more."
25892,Very funny to watch your friends reactions of it
25893,"this game is very fun especially with other friends, having fun and generaly spending time ""chillin'"" with your friends.
the game isn't too graphicly attracting but the gameplay is SO addicting that plowing though enemies will hook you on for HOURS especially with your firends. 
WARNING PLAYING THE GAME SOLO AND ONLY SOLO WILL TAKE A LOT OF ASPECTS OF THIS GAME.
PLEASE KEEP CALM AND HAVE A FRIEND TO PLAY WITH.  THANK YOU."
25894,This game is fantastic. Button mashing and simple humor that makes it a fun experience.
25895,"Super fun and easy to get into. A great game to play with your friends as well. You could breeze through it and play for fun, or challenge yourself after you beat the game in ""insane"" mode. 
It does get somewhat repetitive after a while, but you will have lots of fun before that happens."
25896,"Nostalgia, great gameplay, but it gets repetitive, but nonetheless one of the best beat-em-up games ever!"
25897,"Pretty good overall.
Only complaint is that online multiplayer is very laggy but otherwise the game works great and is a lot of fun."
25898,"I played TMNT Turtles in Time on the SNES, Konami's XMEN at the arcade, Dad 'n Me on Newgrounds over and over back in the day. Castle Crashers is the Behemoth's love letter to beat-em-up games.

Somewhere between Dan Paladin's art style, the killer soundtrack, Behemoth's irreverant humor, and a metric butt ton of creativity and love for the project, they've formulated one of my favorite games.

I've even purchased the game multiple times on different platforms. Absolutely worth every penny.

25913,"[h1]Overview[/h1]
Castle Crashers is a side-scrolling beat em’ up that combines intense multiplayer action with a unique sense of humor and excellent artistic design.

The story begins with an evil wizard stealing the king's magical crystal and kidnapping the four princesses. It's up to you, and possibly your friends, to defeat the wizard; which proves to be challenging because he has unleashed hordes of barbarians upon the world you'll have to fight through.

[h1]Graphics & Sound[/h1]
The hand-drawn artstyle is amazing, it fits the game perfectly and really makes it shine. Every map is unique and they've paid a lot of attention to detail, they also each play differently, which makes the world worth exploring. They also visually represent their humour very well. 

The sound effects and music are also impressive, the action of a good fight is very well complimented with sound, and the music always fits the scene perfectly. The title screen also has a very catchy tune that I'll never forget.


[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Castle Crashers is a side-scrolling beat-em-up that incorporates a small number of role-playing video game elements that can be played with up to 4 people, both locally and online. After choosing a character, you get to choose a level on a mario-like map overview. The goal of most stages is fairly simple; you go from the left side of the map to the right side of the map killing every enemy in your path, and every few levels you'll encounter a boss. 
There's many unique enemies and bosses to fight stops the game from feeling linear and repetitive. Each boss is also unique and are very enjoyable to fight.
There's many weapons and animal orbs (pets that boost a certain stat) to unlock, some can be bought in shops and some can be found throughout the levels. There's also many characters to choose from. You start off with 4 characters, but you unlock more for each character you finish the game with, for each arena you finish, and there's also 2 characters you can purchase as DLC, and the profits go to charity.
There's 3 combat types you can use to kill enemies; melee, Bow and arrow and magic. Melee and bow and arrow is the same for each character, but many characters have unique magical powers. You gain experience (exp) for killing enemies, once you've gained enough exp you'll level up which will award you with a perk point, which you can use to boost either one of your combat types or your defense.

The story mode itself takes about 4-6 hours to finish, but there's also an 'insane mode', which is the same as the regular story but more challenging. The game also features 2 mini-games, one of them is the Arena mini-game; this is where you have to survive multiple waves of enemies, or fight your friends.

The controls work very well using both a controller and a keyboard. I've played the game using a PlayStation 3 controller, a Steam controller and a keyboard; and in all 3 cases the character controller very smoothly. I do recommend to play with a controller, it's slightly better in my opinion.

The game is recommended to be played with multiple players. Singleplayer plays fine, but it is much more challenging, frustrating and less enjoyable than teaming up with your friends. The worst about playing alone is that enemies will all team up on you, sometimes spamming ranged attack disallowing you to get back into a safe area. Also in singleplayer, once you die, you have to redo the level; in multiplayer this is different because your teammates can still revive you.



[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Graphics
+ Sound Effects
+ Music
+ Controller support
+ Steam achievements and trading cards
+ Replayability
+ Well Polished and smooth gameplay

[b]Cons:[/b]
- The game is fairly short
- Combat can get repetitive
- Unoriginal Story

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Castle Crashers is one of the best indie games I have ever played, and it's a game I still enjoy to this day. Certainly a must-have in your library for when you have some friends over.
The gameplay and controls feel very fluid and smooth, combat is really fun but can get slightly repetitive. The game also offers some humor here and there that should be mentioned.
Even though the game feels a little short, it offers a lot of replayability, There's multiple fighting styles to explore, many weapons and pets to collect and many characters to unlock and level.

Overall a game I can certainly recommend!

25940,"It's a quirky little hack n' slash with the classic, age-old story about rescuing a princess...or 4 of them in this game. Lots of characters to choose from, lots of weapons, lots of pets too. Even after beating the game, it still has replay value for just finding the rest of the hidden goodies like the unique weapons and all the critters. Very basic and linear gameplay. It's something I can play with my kids for the multiplayer feature and something I can teach the young ones who are just starting to learn that the buttons on a controller make things happen in the game. The production values are not nearly that of a serious software developer, but you can still see and feel the effort and heart that went into this gem from its creators and the community that helped."
25941,They crash castles. And so they do.

25956,Good game to spend time with friends
25957,"I love this game! It is absolutely my favorite game of all time! The story is great, and the jokes never get old. It is fun with friends or by yourself. I own it on Xbox 360, Steam, and the remastered version on Xbox One. You can play through the story, what seems to be infinite times, with a new character each go. Because of this game, Behemoth is my favorite gaming company. I suggest you check it out; especially if you are into RPGs with: an EXP leveling up system, chickens, in game currency, beat em ups, multiplayer, great music, ""that one game that you, well, you know...haha"",  magic, hidden treasure, connections to other games made by Behemoth, unlockable characters, crude humor, gore, princesses, and a fun story."

25983,Its good I guess? Its pretty good. Its good I like it
25984,"I finished the game with every unlockable characters on Xbox 360. Seven years later I'm doing the same on Steam.
Do I have a problem with this game ? Probably.
Is this game awesome ? Double yes !"
25985,"It's a fairly straightforward beat 'em up game, with amazing graphics, a godlike soundtrack by the folks at Newgrounds, and plenty of content for you to keep yourself busy with. It's a lot of fun to play with friends, but the single-player experience is not degraded by any means. The gameplay itself is endearing and doesn't get tedious easily, and there are many of characters to choose from (each with their own magic skills), many weapons and pets to discover and use, and a New Game + feature to add a new challenge to an already fairly expansive game for beat 'em up standards.

P.S.: This is also a game that features huge discounts whenever it's on sale, so don't be afraid to put your pocket change to use!"

26003,Total fun!
26004,"This game is radical, so random and unexpected. very funny. 10/10"
26005,"This is another game that I enjoy for both the nostalgia and the gameplay. I played this game on the Ps3 a ton and completed it hundreds (of course not literally) of times. Even now the gameplay is fun and always replayable. I love being able to beat the games with many of different characters and there's so many ways to get these new characters, like by beating the game with a specific character."
26006,:)
26007,"Bought this for my kids to paly with, wound up buying more controllers so we could all play together."
26008,"Nothing really needs to be said about this game.
Just another basic beat-em-up.
But is it really?
This game adds story, unique characters (in their own way), followers, upgrades, Co-op, and even minigames?
Maybe this game is worth the $15.00 it cost. You should definitely try it though."
26009,"Genial para pasar una tarde con amigos. 
Tiene un humor Bizarro que me encanta."
26010,funny game :v
26011,I nominated it for best use of a farm animal because of the chicken sword
26012,I had a lot of fun playing through castle crashers with my friends and for that it gets my recomendation
26013,"This game is just awesome. It is like a running gag between you and your best friends, which keeps serving laughters for months even after dozens of playthroughts. 
And when it comes to playthrought it never realy wears off. Every charakter has its 
charme and unique abilities. The hard-mode playthrough is very tough and nearly not possible to succseed without fellow crashers.

Long story short : This is a 10 out of 10 game and a must have for any local gaming party."
26014,"Very funny game, better with friends and a controller.
Must have it."
26015,A fun game.
26016,"Castle Crashers is one if those games that only comes around every once in a while. One of those games that never goes out of style or gets boring. It's a game everyone should get a chance to play. It's fun, funny, and weird. It doesnt have a whole lot of play time but it's always a good choice when you're hanging out with the crew."
26017,"Definately a fun game for beat 'em up game fans or people who enjoy playing games focused on co-op. 

Lots of custamization and unlockables
PvP and PvE
Not story focused
Cartoony Graphics and silly plot
Great net code and multiplayer support"
26018,"What is Castle Crashers?

Simply put, its Super Smash Bros meets Adventure Sidescroller

You go out, trash mobs, kill giant bosses, eat sandwiches to gain superpowers, and even scares a deer shitless

Buy it"
26019,this game is a calssic it being on pc is great. it is better if you have a controller. but if you move around the controls a little bit it still works
26020,"A bloody brilliant game, in it most literal sense !
Co op with upward of 4 pals and/or frienemies, as you battle out to take control of the map. Adventure through the beautiful and vibrant backdrop created by the artist as you try to emerge yourself into a brawl, with heavy emphasis of brutal slapstick comedy, ranging from cardboard tubes, a fish, a chicken, and a broad spectrum of blunt force trauma to headtakers. Many unexpected and original jokes made, which kept the game fresh for such a lengthy time. After you finish the campaign, there are challenges behind the pilgrimage as you struggle through a fight to the death, where rules of Chivalry is out of the window once you enter the arena, or scarper for your life in the frantic game mode 'Back off Barbarians. One of the outstanding and unique 4 player co-op, medieval/fantasy themed brawler game, possibly of the decade. It has certainly stood tall in the test of time, especially with its recent HD remaster. A must buy if you have friends that looks forward to an adventure."
26021,"One of the best Co-Op games I've played both on Console and PC. Cheap, fun, casual for all to enjoy."
26022,I never asked for this
26023,"While this game is well polished, visually appealing and humorous in its own right, Castle Crashers really shines when playing co-op with a couple of friends."
26024,"The ultimate couch co-op game. Duel enemies, each other, play through a story and unlock cute animals and awesome weapons along the way. The art-style is timeless and the music tops it all off. This game is very replayable with various kinds of characters and some playstyles. Sadly this version doesn't come with all the DLC."
26025,Funny Game xD
26026,Great for a party.
26027,Funny Game with nice Co-op.

26070,Hah The best Game!!
26071,"i already did this shit back on ps3
its good
getout"
26072,its a great fun awesoem game :D
26073,This game is just tons of fun to play both by yourself and especially with friends
26074,Do you know that Alladin game from megadrive or sega pamplona? this is worse.
26075,Probably one of the best beat-em-up games you could play on Steam.
26076,yes :D yes orange fire
26077,"One of the best beat'em up games avaliable. You can join local, online COOP with up to 4 friends and bring destruction upon your enemies. There're lots of unlockable characters, the game is really fun, and has a great replay value. Making it perfect for an ocasional casual night of gameplay with friends."
26078,"Excellent game, very fun! Pick it up for many fun-filled hours with friends and family. Replay it with all the characters but it'll never get old."
26079,"That's a perfect game. I think everybody can enjoy while playing this game :D
"
26080,one of the best couch co-op games to date! an oldy but a goody!
26081,Issssssss gud
26082,"Bad game. Got the game and all of the dlc, but the start button wont work. The xbox version is good, but the computer version sucks."
26083,"Fun beat em up game, make sure you use a controller"
26084,"I played this game couch co-op (2 players with game controllers) and I really enjoyed it. Different characters to choose from, each one has unique special elemental moves. There are plenty of weapons and ""pets"" to get through out the game, which give you different stat bonus or even handicap. Game is gradually getting heavier towards the end, so there was no time I was bored. My favourite item in the game is the hyper steroid sandwich, first time using it was hilarious.

If you are looking for good local co-op action, I highly recommend this game."
26085,"By far the best game i have ever played on both pc and ps3, noticed a few bugs on pc but doesn't stop me"
26086,im having  troubles it wont run the actual game and if it does then the game never launches
26087,a complex game is almost similar to super meat boy
26088,"Very good game,
I already played it on xbox and bought it for pc now."
26089,"This is one awesome hack & slash game. The gameplay and graphics are fun and enjoyable, there is a lot of characters to unlock and play with, as well as new weapons and pets. Singleplayer is great but it's way better if you play co-op with a friend. Get this game right away."
26090,It's pretty fun
26091,"This game has timed great, amazing gameplay, awesome multiplayer, and so addicting, definetely worth it at full price or any price, great solo, awesome multiplayer"
26092,"This game was an awesome experience for my two friends and I to play through. It was long enough to be worth the money, but not too long to make it tiresome. 

Each Knight is a little different so everyone can stand out amongst the others.

Every level is full of different enemies, funny situations and tons of different weapons to try out.

You level up into different attributes, learn new magic moves and try out new weapons. 

One of the downsides we found was it can be hard to tell if you're standing in the right spot to hit an enemy. It can be hard to adjust perfectly but this didn't really make us want to quit or even change our opinion of the game."
26093,"Castle Crashers is honestly a classic. I played this game way back when it first came out in 2012 on XBOX 360 and now the remastered version for PC. The game is a very coop based action/adventure game, and because of its low graphical demand, many people with less than up to date machines can run and enjoy it. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean low graphical demand in a bad way, it's just apart of the games overall feel. I would recommend this game to anyone and I Have even bought a few of my friends a copy of it. 10/10 excellent gameplay and story with funny moments throughout."
26094,good game
26095,"If you have friends and you wanna play co-op this game is definetly for you. If an expansion ever comes out, am gonna be the first to buy it, no second thought. xD"
26096,"If you liked Battleblock Theater, then you will surely like Castle Crashers.

Castle Crashers is a story about 4 princesses that ends up getting kidnapped as well as a powerful stone. Your role is a knight of the castle and you must fight your way through and defeat a boss to save a princess. There also stats which you upgrade by defeating a level and earning stat points. Make sure to choose wisely on how you upgrade your knight!

Pros:
- It's fun and better with friends.

Cons:
- Rage mode when you die."
26097,Kinda like Lego games without the HUGE selections of characters to play with.
26098,really good. Worth the 3 Reais
26099,"Great game!  Alot of fun playing 4 player coop, I really forgot how fun local coop games could be and scrolling beat em ups in general.  The small upgrade system was a nice addition as well, and the game was a nice length and difficulty.  Not too easy but tot too hard.  It was a little bit on the button mashy side, but the addition of bows and magic help break that up a little bit.  Oh, and the games artwork and humor was a good touch as well."
26100,get this game it's so much fun
26101,Good game highly recommend you play this game super fun
26102,very fun game
26103,"Nice simple cute art game, straight foward hack n slash game. However, co-op is kinda dead. :/"
26104,"So funny game, nice art and amazing animation."
26105,Very fun gameplay. Nice graphics. [insert positive adjective here] soundtrack.
26106,"It is a game by TheBehemoth, what more is there to say? This game is fantastic!"
26107,This game is so awesome. I love designs <3
26108,Fun for the whole family!
26109,Such a well put together and amazing game would ove another gmae like this by behemoth
26110,"Best beat 'em up yo trust my words and if you don't, play the demo first and you'll see that I said the truth."

i r8 9/11
no but seriously, i got this as a gift from a friend and trust me, this is something you don't want to miss when it's on sale. but even when not on sale this game is totally worth it. it's a game you can take anywhere with you as it doesn't need a good computer or a mouse. i also like the fact how you can play local multiplayer if you have a controller."
26116,"Great game, i remember playing this on the 360 years ago and its still a very fun game. lots of characters to unlock and weapons to get"
26117,"If you want a game of action, fight, adventure and best of all, multiplayer. This is the game you need, contains an incredible story, unlockable characters and variety of them. Super recommended and simply perfect"

26121,"[h1]Mario on Acid???[/h1]
Ok, it might not play like Mario... or be a 2D Sidescroller.... and is pretty much a beat em up but there’s a bad guy and a princess! Actually, there’s 4 bad guys and 4 princesses! So close enough right.

So yeah this game is actually really fun. It has a pretty standard storyline, Life’s great, Bad guy's steal princesses, Lifes not so great anymore, save princesses, defeat evil, save world or something and life is good again.
There are 4 main bosses and a bunch of extra mini bosses throughout the levels most of which when you first find are completely ridiculous and great!

This game is designed to be over the top with its emeries, level progression and it works perfectly into the art design. 
Created by The Behemoth you can be assured that this game is going to be quality as they have yet to make a bad or boring game. ""but they've only made like 3 games"" SILIENCE!

There are a bunch of different pets you can collect that do different things and swords to find along the way. You can spec your character to be melee, magic, agility + pet (which is also bow or something) or a combo of both/ and or all. I went mainly Magic with the green knight so I'd just spam acid at everything (see what I did it the title becuase I used th.. thing with....ok moving on..)

There are a few other game modes like Arena, Some grid based mode where you have to dodge enemies as long as possible (which I just spammed buttons to get the 2:30 achievement btw) & Insane mode (which is just the same game but harder). These are really just for fun with friends for a bit at this point since Multiplayer is ....ded. 

I played this with 1 other & tried it solo but its defiantly more fun with atleast one other. 
Now... I'm 100% a PC Master Race elitist but this is one game you need to play with a controller and NOT a keyboard. Believe me... I tried, I really did but you just can’t... Just no.... use a controller. 

[h1]9.9/10[/h1]
[i]- Great Game to co-op with friends, online is dead, USE A CONTROLLER![/i]"
26122,"Pros+
Great characters.
Funny scenes.
Great story.
Fun bosses.
Alot of characters to choose from.
Multiplayer.
Four differnt gamemodes to choose from.
Addicting.
Kinda old. But still a great game!
fight your friends for relationships. 10/10.
Bunch of weapons and pets to take on your funny little journey!

Cons-

when you lose to get a relationship against ur friends. 10/10 (not a con. just sarcasm :^))


Overall. 12 Euros is really worth this game. Price should rise. Amazing game."

26124,"I dont need too much words to describe ths game, It is very funny and good."
26125,It was hype. I played it on the 360 then one of my best friends gave this to me and I still love it
26126,time spent well
26127,Fun characters and fun when play with my friends
26128,Impossible to play for me. Played it on xbox but the PC controls are insanly hard to use.
26129,Amazing!
26130,"Meh... I tried it in single player only and it felt like a grind (perhaps coop is better?)

1. Game can be sadistically frustrating at times. Especially considering there is no moment of invincibility after getting up from being knocked down. Very easy to get juggled between enemies until your dead with virtually nothing you can do to get away beyond button mashing and trying to hop away during the 1 or 2 frames that their attacks don't perfectly sync up to keep you knocked down. Some times you've got 2 guys puching you close up and 2 more on each side shooting ranged arrows or bombs at you making it impossible to get away.

2. I felt the game was a lot of a grind due to enemies taking far too long to take down - again probably because it was single player. But as far as I'm concerned a game like this should adjust the enemy HP based on the total number of people playing. I'm sure 800 HP seems fine when you've got 3 other buddies hacking away with you but as a solo player it take FOREVER to take down 1 guy at 21hp a hit.

3. I also feel that airial attacks are pathetic, considering that every enemy has a ranged attack that they use mercilessly with almost no cooldown needed sometimes you have to stay in the air and try to attack from above but the only airial attack I unlocked 2 hours in did 1 or 2 hp damage (so basically nothing).

4. Most of the time I was just mashing the same couple buttons to try to land attacks to clear the screen as fast as possible. In many cases as a single player you get swarmed and there isn't enough time to try to do meaningful combos. I rarlely used the guys magic because A) it did little damage B) only hit the one guy standing directly in front of you and C) it left you open to getting juggle attacked from behind.

Anyway... I found there were a lot of things that made the game more aggrivating than enjoyable - I'm really surprised how many people are die hard fanboys for this thing... I mean it's an alright game if you're a fan of the genre, can get it on sale and plan to only play with friends. But for me it just felt like a button mashing grind and my eye was always on the clock wondering ""how much longer is this game"" or ""holy crap how long is it going to take to kill this one frigging guy?.  

I loved the art style and maybe it's just because I'm not a huge fan of the genre but I would have like less button mashing grinding and more fast paced action with story behind it."
26131,"1 word AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

26135,Love this game. I know this game is old but i stil love THIS GAME TO THIS DAY
26136,these people crashed my PC... because i played it too much
26137,Wonderful game. I love the gameplay style and the game is much better with friends. And it lets you use multiple keyboards  and controllers

Pretty funny beat-em-up with coop=)"
26147,Play it for the sake of your family.
26148,this is such a fun game to play. i love to play with my friends i think that anyone should play this game.
26149,"Great game to play with friends or solo, a ton of entertainment with good music, hidden treasures and challenging levels. Once you are high level you can just finish the game an try the hadcore version, several characters, pets and weapons. If on sale, get the 4-pack to share with friends, worth every cent."
26150,Love it. Played it on  xbox a long time ago and just bought a 4 pack while it was on sale. 20/10 would play endlessly for 10 straight hours with friends again.
26151,"A very fun game with lots of replay value in it. If you like a little bit of a challenge and playing with your friends. (If you have any)
"
26152,"my favourite sosig game xdddanja  vsung
yay"
26153,"I was gifted this game, and boy am I glad for it. The game controls are simple with the controller, but with the keyboard. Well if your playing with a keyboard just get a controller. The story is rather peculiar and questionable. Though is quite silly, Me and my friends had a great time playing this and we are restarting the game on insane and with new characters. I highly recommend this game if you have 3 friends that would enjoy to beat the hell out of some stuff."
26154,good meme
26155,"It is funny, it is made Behemoth, it gets you a head for Battle Block, it is local coop, it is a must buy... if you like local coop games"

26157,sabroso
26158,"Good amount of characters to unlock, deep emotional story, quick beat 'em up combat, multiplayer, and an appealing, cartoony art style? This game has them all. Just give them your money already!!"
26159,The game is awesome and the support is even greater. Just write an email and they'll respond fast and will help oyu. Best support I've seen so far.
26160,Simple fun!

26163,"God, I didn't know there is a game like this. My friend introduced it to me, then I just bought it. After I installed it, my friend invited me to play together.

WTH...., it's so much fun~!!! OMG~!!! Laughing so hard and yeah, absolutely recommended! (=w=)b"
26164,AWESOME!!!!!

"
26174,wery nice!
26175,nice
26176,How do you give a perfect review to a perfect game? You don't. You encourage people to try the Demo themself. If this game had been in the Arcade back in the 90's I would have been broke forever; but I'll settle for buying it for the third time right now.
26177,"HOW TO GET CARPEL TUNNEL:


Play this game.

This game... is so very gud. Play it.

9/10 would break my hands again.

(Srsly tho play with controller)"
26178,"5/10
This game is very fun with some friends very much like Cuphead. Great game to play with friends and has a more difficult game mode which I couldn't even get through. The story is kinda random but the game isn't meant for the story it's for the gameplay which it nailed very well and I thought was good but does get kind of boring eventually."
26179,ye this game is bad ass.
26180,Классная игра
26181,"SUPER FUN WITH FRIENDS, although my hands hurt like hell playing for hours on end this game is great with friends. its challenging but rewarding as you level through the content, I do wish some newer levels would unlock for the 2nd time through but overall cant complain the game was great!

Worth a purchase and pick up a couple of extra copies for your friends!"
26182,very good
26183,its good yeah
26184,"I really love this game and I only got it yesterday, I have gotten the chance to play single CC, single BOB (Back off Barbarian) and single Arena, and they're all fun, but I've only played CC in multiplayer, but heres my review.

Pros:
- The simple character designs are nice and cute
- The enemies are all original, some bosses are easy but some require multiplayer  due to some of them being too hard
- Multiplayer is fun and awesome
- Good fighting system
- It never fails to make me have a good time
- Simple but nice story
- Overall it's just a nice game

Cons: 
- Multiplayer is laggy
- Due to lag, some people disconnect
- Some weapons are so OP they make certain enemies seem like nothing, but some weapons are so weak the make enemies seem like Satan himself
- I don't feel motivated to use my magic, but I use it sometimes

Castle Crashers is my favourite game out of all games I've played in my entire life, I Love it and I definatley recommend it, if you haven't played it when who the hell are you??

I also have some screenshots :)"
26185,Awesome co-op game with amazing graphics and very cool story.. just buy it
26186,10/10 controller destroyer
26187,Absolute memes.
26188,Great game.
26189,"I can't say the story is very intriguing, it just being that you are a warrior who needs to kill the bad guy to save the 4 damsels in distress, but it is still a crapload of fun playing. The certain weapons and skill points you put into your character makes them feel like they really are yours, and noone elses. Even if you don't like the button-mashy gameplay, and if you have ears then you will obviosly love this games tone-setting soundtrack. The boss fights may not be difficult, if you know what you're doing, but learning the AIs patterns in attacking you is enjoyable"
26190,"i love this game
+very fun with friends and online
+great music
+great animations
+great drawns
+you can level up
+beat monsters
+save princess
+kill your friends

26199,"best sexy free games for kids ever
"
26200,"there are two choices in this game, and you don't choose either one"
26201,"Behemoth is a solid game developer. Battleblock Theater and Castle Crashers are excellent representations of how games should be made. Funny, great and non-forced co-op, great stories and art design."
26202,"You should get this game and it's very easy to play. Only bad part are the controls, but you can always switch that in settings. So good that I bought the blacksmith and pink knight DLC 
"
26203,"Funny, charming,challenging and very well optimized for co-op."
26204,"Amazing Game :D

I owned this for the Xbox 360 when it was first released & sunk countless hours into it, absolutley brilliant. Couldn't help but buy it again on here!"
26205,"I purchased this by accident and I hate it
"
26206,"Great game 

"
26207,"This game was absolutely AWESOME!!
I  Recommend u buy this game :D
There should be a sequel to this game."
26208,this game is so good I put a lot of time into the 360 version but I wish u could sync your xbox profiles
26209,Im so happy that this game was on sale because if it was not i would not be able to replay this game with my friends other than that it is an amazing game with funny random moments
26210,the world needs more games like this!
26211,<3
26212,its dumb
26213,"This is one of the best games I've played, I recommend buying this game."
26214,"CC is one of the best co-op games currently available, there's a story like every other, save the princess blah blah but the levels you come across are amusing and the enemies are for the most part challenging. There is so much replayability to this because once you finish it it just gets harder, like Borderlands, and you can start a new character and continue starting again as much as you like because you won't get bored if you're playing this with friends. If you are alone you probably won't have a grand time."
26215,"Save the damsel! Be the hero! Beat the bad guy! Play with your friends!

Take the role as a knight and defend your kingdom! The enemy has captured all of the damsels and you must get them back! Explore the vast land and climb over the piles of bad guys that you will leave in your wake. Like weapons? There are tons of them! Like having helpful buddies on your journey? They've got those too! What about co-op? Pssh, they have a 4-player option!

This game brings out the entertainment that we all desire from time to time. You have a silly storyline with underlying seriousness, a great soundtrack to keep your ears happy, and easy gameplay that won't leave you confused.

Play it, you won't be disappointed."
26216,Decapitating muslim men who can also turn into tornadoes? Random ''beach volleyball'' game in the middle of a fight which me and my boyfriend couldn't even get past? THIS GAME WAS NOT MEANT FOR VOLLEYBALL. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A FUN WACKY FIGHTING SIDE SCROLLER. WHY ARE YOU MAKING US PLAY VOLLEYBALL WITH FUCKED UP CONTROLS AND GLITCHES. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST ENJOYABLE. Some of the level design is messed up too! I could barely see what I was doing when there were random poles and other crap ACTUALLY blocking my view. I have a migraine. Not reccomended. Will cause heart palpitation and rage quitting.
26217,"message me when you stop at the volleyball part, this game has caused me actual physical pain from the sheer lack of effort to incorporate any kind of depth perception"
26218,"Great fun game to play with kids, and friends."
26219,5/5 would smash again. PS: This game CRASHES a lot.
26220,"-Played gray knight
-Died too much

This game is just amazing ! I want, we want this same game but with an other history / maps because this game is funny to play.
Please, make a Castle Crashers 2, this game is my life, i played at this since 10 years old !
Thanks a lot Behemoth ! (U are my favorite developers <3<3<3)"
26224,"Castle Crashers is an old-time classic everyone should have played in his/her life! (equality, yay!)


While you and the whole castle enjoy your party, the evil invades the castle and abducts the 4 princesses!
Be a man (and knight) and save these cute princesses!


In Castle Crashers, you have to complete various levels, saving the princesses one by one and ultimately defeat the boss behind this evil plot.


The controls are very easy and the game is full with funny moments you will enjoy for sure!
I recommend playing this game with at least one friend as it makes the game funnier and adds a few modes to the game (like duels after saving a princess and so on).


After your first playthrough, the insane mode will be unlocked and this means more items, pets, characters and fun!!!


This game is a MUST and I dare you to play it if you haven't already.


Smokagon, out~"
26225,LIKE!

26245,Great game anyone who likes battle block theatre or minecraft would like.
26246,help idk how to ride the deer
26247,"Fantastic game, hard but manageable.  definetly a favorite"
26248,"What can I say, it's great to play with friends, but kind of boring if you're gonna play it alone. Don't buy this if you're gonna go single player."
26249,Fun beat'em up for large and small.
26250,"Fun coop excellent, and funny boss fight"
26251,Castle Crashers is a classic hack and slash co-op game thats only gotten better with its port to PC. If you enjoy co-op games make sure you give this one a go.
26252,"这个游戏，
讲的是强大的巫师抢走了国王的宝石，野蛮人抢走了公主，公主又被小偷走卖到各地。帅气的骑士过一关又一关，最后终于把巫师杀死，并救回所有公主的故事。=w=
童鞋，前面的公主丑吧。千万别惊讶，后面的更丑。(╯‵□′)╯︵┻━┻
你还不能因为她丑，你就不救他，不救他怎么通关呀！
你也不能因为她丑，就自己自主被基友按在地上打，这不行！你基友会说你菜！QAQ
这游戏是不是因为公主嫁不掉策划的强卖强嫁呀。国王这个心机汉子。

"
26253,"The combat and characters are awesome and really fun to play with (finally a king from a video game who actually does somthing to save thier country!). All the enemys and levels are cool and the bosses are fun to fight (especialy the deer/barn chase section).

However a problem I had was post-completion content. After you finish the game with one character you can unlock new characters to play with (actually you can do this before completing the game in arenas but that's besides the point). When you unlock the characters, all you can do with them is play the entire game with no differences all over again. 

What's that? you wan't to unlock ALL the characters? Well good luck  because that means playing the ENTIRE game 7-8 TIMES with different characters AND ABOSLUTELY NO CHANGE IN THE STORY OR GAMPLAY WHATSOEVER (you also play a different mode using a character you've won the game with but it's literally the same thing except the enemys are stronger). 

I just personally find this really annoying but I know of people who like this format.

Aside from the whole ""replay with new characters thing"" it's a really fun game and actually one of my favourite Behemoth games (but you can't beat Battle Block Theatre)."
26254,Good
26255,"I wanted a game that my wife and son would play with me and once I convinced them to try it they fell in love with it.  No complaints whatsoever, very fun game, and challenging."
26256,Shits dank
26257,THIS GAME IS AWESOME AND IS ADDICTING
26258,"Pros

+Hillariously drawn character designs and animations.
+Great music.
+Tons of fun online with friends.
+Fluid controls.
+Amazing amount of weapon, pet, and character variety.
+Lots of levels to play through with several unique bosses.
+Tons of different enemy types.
+You can kill your friends in order to get a Princess' kiss. Why wouldn't you want to?
+Insanely challenging on the ""Insane"" difficulty that you unlock after beating the game with your character once.
+Back Off Barbarian is a fun little time waster mini game.
+Good beat em up combat with decent RPG mechanics.

Cons

-Some of the weapons and characters are so overpowered that they make everything a joke or so weak that it makes the game almost impossible to beat.

Overall Castle Crashers is a very fun beat em up that I highly recommend to everybody who enjoys the genre."
26259,"This game is so good and fun ! 
I recommended it to everyone who has low computer settings,"
26260,"epic adventure with a lot of fun! :)

castle crashers takes the elements combined of traditional side scrolling, fast paced, rpg styled beat'em up fights with various situation and a quest line to do. 
there is a lot of humor in the game, be prepare to giggle every minute of it :)
it has a little surprise factor in the scenes which will please the players well, yes you have heard it right players because you can play with your friends too~
overall the graphic is gorgeous with that illustrated scenery, music is so freaking awesome.. you will bump to it like a bouncy ball lul ^^

grab three friends now and slash through your way on that monster horde and enjoy your epic roller coaster journey! ^-^

26261,"Great game for all ages, 10/10 best game
"
26262,"GOOOOOOOOD VIDEO GAMEEEEEEEE, oh sorry that was my 'buy this game right now' alarm"
26263,Fun game when you have friends-n-family to play with.
26264,Originally played on the Xbox 360 4 years ago and when I found out it was on Steam I couldn't be more happy.
26265,"You know what crashes more than castles?!

This ga... oh no it doesnt

26266,"Great game, very addicting!"
26267,newgrounds had this i think
26268,"Loads of fun. Do your wallet a favor and buy this whilst it is on sale and get the four-pack to share with friends!
This game is loads of more fun with friends, it is greatly worth the investment!
*Highly recommend a controller*"
26269,"I bought diz game cuz I was on newgroundz and I like diz
But now I think its having less playerz nowadays......."
26270,I love playing this with my friends.
26271,Includes animals with a severe case of diarrhea.
26272,"Castle Crashers is a fun game with a colorful, unique feel to it.

11/10 would crash another castle"
26273,"Never finished it, personally

Pros
Fun times with friends

Cons
Easily bored (personal opinion)
Bad ping (for non U.S.A players)"
26274,Good Game. Very Fun And Addicting And All Of The People MUST BUY IT! [VERY FUN AND ADDICTING CUTE LITTLE CHARACTERS AND COOL SPELL / SKILLS] UNLOCKABLE TEAMMATES WHICH DO NOT COST MONEY BUT CAN BE FOUND INGAME!
26275,Nice
26276,Very cool game!
26277,"This game is a real gem in my library. I completed it long time ago, but I will never forget great jokes in every sentence, awesome story, great battle performance or amazing COOP. If you are trying to find great game which can make you rolling on floor laughing and you never played this one you deffinitelly should consider buying this beauty. 12/10"
26278,Very enjoyable.
26279,"This game is seriously fun, even better with friends."
26280,I would rate this game 4/5 it's a super fun game to play with friends. I'm not sure it could hold my attention playing solo though. If you have friends to play with its definitely a great pickup
26281,great 4 player co-op game. cheap as well
26282,Good !
26283,"It's great fun with friends, and if you get special stuff your friends challenge you to a arena match and they die :D"
26284,mmm hmm
26285,"Fun, epic, silly, and you probably already played the xbox360 version anyways. What could one say that hasn't already been said?"
26286,hey its pretty good
26287,i liked it.
26288,This game is amazing 10/10
26289,Too good. i rate 12/10!!!1
26290,"It is great fun to play with friends, but the control on the keyboard is very complicated."
26291,"Its a nice game to play with your friends to pass time i guess, not much more then that."
26292,Fun until you beat single player and coop but still a great game. 9/10 burgers
26293,"Lets start my 8th Playthrough with friends :D

Seriously tho

Not for the lighthearted *COUGH* TRUKALDO *COUGH*

Good for the Gamers"
26294,"Same as BBT (Battle Block Theatre) u need some friends to enjoy this game, I recommend controller and that friends
fun and beautiful design (y)"
26295,Super meat boy clone
26296,"Even after 4 years, this game it still is amazing. This game follows the adventures of 4 knights brilliantly named: red knight, green knight, blue knight, and orange knight, Who are trying to regain the kings gem, and the 4 princess's from the necromancer and his subjects. This is an arena based hack'n slash, comedy game which (unsuprisingly) is freeking hilarious, considering that there is no voice acting, and next to no diolouge. This game has excelent replayability, with many other knights to collect; each with there own unique abilities and stats, weapons to collect, and a system of pvp minigames to play against friends. I give this game a 10/10"
26297,nice game!
26298,Comical content that is moderately challenging
26299,"Castle Crahers is a great game to play with friends on a shared screen. It is based in a silly medieval fantasy world where your goal is to save princesses from an evil magician. All that was done way before Aventure Time became popular.

It has an original style, with the vibe of older games made by the same developers, and a good sense of humour.

The fighting system is quite complex for a game of this genre and presents the players with a good variety of combos which increase in numbers with level progression. Friends of mine who were not used to games of this type usualy feel overwhelmed after a few levels.

The level progression adds an element that enhances the experience as an element of competion between the players. It allows players to upgrade different stats which unlock combos and abilities which gives options 'builds' for different playthroughs, although magic and melee weapon attack are always the best options to choose from. It is also fun to have different players focusing on a certain stat more than the others.

There is a choice of characters to play with which except for the visual style differ only in the types of spells they cast which can be very different from each other in terms of damage, area of effect and the effect itself. I found this more than enough to make want to play the game again as other characters.

A variety of weapons and consumables are also present, but they do not change the gameplay to a great extent. The absence of different bows other than the starting one is also disappointing,

There are a lot of different enemy types, some of which can be unlocked as player-controled characters which adds to the game's replayability.

The levels are numerous and with a different feel to most of them. One of the most pleasant surprises was how long the game was.

Definetely the best co-op side-scroller I have played and I have played a decent number of them."
26300,"Really awesome! This game life!!!
I eat it
I breathe it
I drink it
etc."
26301,Fun.
26302,bad
26303,This is shit.
26304,"Fun but can also be quite hard. Could use a little more depth with something like skill trees that weren't straight up stat upgrades, but other than that it's amazing. Good job!"
26305,"Very, very good. And a great coop game too. It is a game you will play over and over with or without your friends."
26306,"Ahh, the childish humor we all have inside of us.


This game is a good beat-em up title, well worth buying. It has some humor to it, of alot depending if you understood it or not. The art style is something interesting too, somewhat nice to watch. Do I recommend it? Yes, no one makes beat-emups anymore, yet they were so popular back then."
26307,"This is one of the best multiplayer fighting/leveling game you can get, and you should definitly get the DLC's too."
26308,Great game with 3 friends!!! including you! yourself!
26309,"If you say straight up to my face that you hate this game or the behemoth, or newgrounds, then I will retaliate with a swift slap to the face and say ""good day sir""! This game deserves a 10/10"
26310,"great game funny cuts and great story line 
i have a special connection to it on xbox 360 this game really lifted my view on games and opinion

behemoth really made great games but castle crashers was a master peace 

100/10
GREAT GAME"
26311,Such an amazing game for anyone who is a fan of hack and slash adventures! You get thrown into a world that has been overtaken by enemies and you ( or you and up to 3 friends ) have to save the four princesses! [spoiler] When you save one you even get to kill your friends to earn a kiss from the princess! [/spoiler] This game is amazing fun and if you don't have this in your steam library then you sir! ( or ma'am ) are not a true gamer! But seriously this game is sooo good! I reccomend it to EVERYONE!
26312,When you play coop its really good but in single player boring after a while xD
26313,"I LOVE THIS!
Played it entirely a few times on the xBox 360, it's funny and awesome to play with a group.
Just do it."
26314,Fantastic brainless entertainment when played with friends.
26315,supposedly fun coop. far too salt inducing (for my allies). boring single player.
26316,"10/10 playing with friends, but be careful, u can't breathe while laughing, so u can die, but I'm not saying dying is bad, i mean it is, but it could be a good way to go, you know, like playing a game and u are laughing that much, and u die...

Great game."
26317,"Honestly, i can say that this is a game that i returned to over and over again to play. I played the Xbox version of it a lot and I can say whole-heartedly that this is a game worth the time and money, with each time playing through with a new character feeling like a fresh new start."
26318,"This game is funny, the story is simple and light hearted, great art style, fight mechaniches, and fun to play with friends.
What more can you ask for?







(realistic graphics, complex story line, and other Triple A crap)"
26319,I killed all of my friends and then got cock blocked by a clown. 3.341345/10
26320,"If you wanna get rage easily, just play level on alien space ship alone."
26321,"Love this game, One of my favorites. Will never get bored of this game. :8bitheart:"
26322,"I revieced this game off of my mate as a gift, and holy hell it is just amazing. 
I love the characters, the story is fun to play and I love all of the new game modes. I think I remember playing this a few times on the PlayStation but I used to suck at it, it is so much simpler to play with a keyboard and mouse, especially since you can customize it to your personal preferences. 

Recently bought myself the Blacksmith character, total bad ass."
26323,"This is my first steam game I have ever bought.


I made a great choice."
26324,No Linux version :(
26325,Its super fun to play
26326,"its a really good game nit much bad about it but they should make another one with more maps and more options for the players 

i give it a 11/10 ign for me"
26327,One of my favourite games of all tiem. Well done!
26328,This is the best game ive ever played Great work
26329,Bought this with my friends while it was on sale for 3$.Amazing experience while trying to fight and kill everything not knowing where each one of us is.Should you buy it?Hell yes even for 12 $ is pretty worth it.Also have some friends to play with or you'll get bored easily.Enjoy this thriving adventure while trying to discover every secret that is hidden in this world.
26330,idk
26331,Amazing game I rate 10/10 because childhood memories
26332,Great game
26333,Cartoon videogames are so much fun! The humor in this game is off teh chart silly.
26334,"Cool game, but very hard achivements.
Liked it,"
26335,One Of The Best Games I Ever Played!!!!!
26336,"Its a great game it's worth the money
"
26337,Finished the main game by my self and with friends. Played Insane mode with friends a little but cannot get passed the bat boss by myself on insane at all. 11/10 would cry again. also just a fun game with friends
26338,wassup doooooood
26339,">buys pink knight pack
>gets lollipop weapon
>slaps the enemies with my lollipop

11/10 would slap my enemies with lollipops again"
26340,very funny game
26341,Best Local Multiplayer with friends. awsome story and its challenging
26342,The gameplay and graphics were super in 2012 and still hold uo outstandingly well today. Still one of the best fun co-op games with LOTS of replayability and a web of complexity underneath the service. There's nothing here not to love.
26343,Fun game
26344,Das ist gut
26345,A fun game to play online with your friends.
26346,"The Battletoads/old school arcade legacy lives on. Mostly. 

Castle Crashers is a 4 player, side scrolling beat em up action RPG.  You choose from an increasing variety of unlockable characters, each of which has their own unique magical abilities, and beat everything in your path to death through a lengthy campaign that puts old beat em ups to shame. 

I wouldn't compare the art maturity to Battletoads, though. In place of ridiculous anvils and axes, etc., that you could morph your appendages into in toads, Castle Crashers uses crude and sometimes disgusting illustrations and ideas to supply it's humor. Like a deer propelled solely by the kinetic force of its own shit. But, to be fair, Castle Crashers also relies every now and then on pop culture humor - like a Schwarzeneggar panda, which Battletoads and Double Dragon also definitely did.

Still, the game is a downright riot when you get 4 players together and start beating everything up. In a genre that's been practically non-existent since the early 90s, Crashers was a breath of fresh air and innovation that harkened back to the old days."
26347,"Fun! I remember when I got it for Xbox 360, it's still as fun as ever!"
26348,10/10 would r8 again
26349,"If you grew up with TMNT, Double Dragon or Battletoads this game is for you.
10/10 Will play again."
26350,"It's a cool very undemanding game, would reccommend for all ages. It take you through adventure, excitement, and bits of comedy. It's also very easy to run at 1080p. In conlusion, I would reccomend it!"
26351,Pro gamer moments exclusive
26352,"This game is so good!I recommended it to everyone who has low computer settings, but has money to buy it! Story of the game is amazing, humor also!!! Benemoth and Newgrounds did well! 11|10!

Игра очень хорошая, тянет на компах с низкими характеристеками! Рекомендую всем! Сюжет и юмор зашкаливает!11/10"
26353,Well constructed game with unique characters and awesome multiplayer.
26354,"This is one of the best co-op games you will ever play. The RPG elements are subtle, but very nice and combined with the leveling progression system provides a nice sense of progression. The art style is something to appreciate with its cartoonie elements. The game is a good length for an indie game not too long, but not too short. The bosses are challenging yet fun. Their is a comedy that is wrapped into the game that makes ot even better as you go through the story. The co-op is a amazing it was built just for co-op. I highly recommend this game it is the best indie game I have ever played."
26355,this game is fun.. i really enjoyed playing with some friend(s) and i really want to play it again :P
26356,"Love this Game :D I'd wait till a sale to get it though. Tons of charcters, the multiplayer is awesome, and just a great beat em up."
26357,BEST GAME EVER KEEP UPDATING PLEASE!!!
26358,Its fun!
26359,swag
26360,really good sugesant getting it not bothered to right
26361,"It was 2.49 the time I snagged this off the summer sale. 
I love the title it's goofy, funny, and just a great game to relax too. 
I recommend this game."
26362,"Long game, and its awesome! Take my word for it, this game has so many things that make replayablilty one of its strong spots, like more knights to play as, heck, find somestuff you didnt see before! 10/10!"
26363,Is gud
26364,"tl;dr Decent hack n' slash with some pervasive non-critical but still annoying issues that dampen the experience. Would recommend in the $4 to $8 price range.

Amount played: I played through the campaign once in co-op mode with a more experienced player.

Pros:

  * Good basic hack n' slash gameplay
  * Unlockable combos
  * Lots of playable characters with different magic types and effects
  * Nice graphics & artistic style
  * Comical character design
  * Augment your player with different weapons, pets, and stat boosts
  * Lots of hidden areas/secrets
  * Progress through different worlds with different themes and different enemies

Cons:

  * Humor is trying too hard to be zany and outrageous
  * Clearly a port
  * Controls could be improved (but are still totally usable and didn't annoy me much)
  * XP is awarded per hit, not for amount of damage dealt (I'm not sure, but that's what I've been told)
  * In co-op mode, weapon & pet storage areas are shared, and the game doesn't distinguish who owns what until you try picking it up
  * No depth perception. It's really easy to miss attack because you don't line up vertically with the target. With flying/jumping enemies, you need to look for their shadows.
  * It's easy to lose your character because other things are in front of them on the screen
  * Sometimes hard to see projectiles when there's a lot going on
  * With lots of enemies, you can get not-quite-stunlocked-but-pretty-nearly-stunlocked for a little while"
26365,"Excellent, excellent game.

Many an hour logged away on 360 with my friends, so don't trust my Steam playtime. I've played through the short campaign at least 15 times.

This is definitely a fantastic game no matter how you cut it, but it really shines with its co-op gameplay. Like an RPG, each character scales in power as the player sees fit. In co-op this makes some characters brutes, some wizards and others speedy little archers. Or a balance of any combination the player wants. This makes co-op fantastic and everyone can be effective regardless of their play style/skill distribution.
Running solo, the game feels a lot more repetitive. You will also have to enjoy defeating enemies with the skills as you've distributed them, making some enemies a bit of a grind and others a breeze. Still a blast to play though.

I guess I'll try this:
10/10 would ride a deer propelled by it's own poop again"
26366,Fantastical fun. Pick it up at some point on sale for a fun co op game to play with your friends.
26367,HACKING SLASHING IM BEATING MY MEAT
26368,"Another great, team/multiplayer oriented party game from Bethesda. I really enjoyed back from when it came out all the way up to today."
26369,"I have been playing this game since around when it was released on the XBox 360. In the years I have been playing it, I still find it fun to do a playthrough. Like with any game, it is fun to play it in different ways, and Castle Crashers definitely delivers with different ways to play. There are many characters and many weapons, most of which can be unlocked throughout your first run. It has very simple graphics, so even a toaster could run it."
26370,yes
26371,"I also own this game on xbox.

This is a great game to play when you want to play something that doesn't require too much thinking. It's a very well done old school beat-em-up. 

Here are some things I like about the game:

1: Cool art style.
2: Fluid and easy to use controls.
3: Stat progression that is simple and makes sense.
4: Tons of weapons that have different stat boosts.
5: Tons of pets that each offer different perks.
6: Quite a few unlockable characters. Each have unique magic attacks.
7: Online 4 player co-op which is a blast.

You won't regret buying this game. Don't expect anything too deep or innovative, just an easy game to pick up and play game that will suck you in for hours at a time."
26372,"Okay lets start out with game mechanics

Its a four person side scroller with a boss at the end of every area with a side dish of Behemoths immaturity (Which i happen to enjoy and thats what made Battleblock Theatre) and a leveling system

Multiplayer is completely optional and you could solo it (Still fun and a great game) while also unlocking other characters with different attack styles/magic AND you can obtain little pets that follow you and give you buffs plus if you don't quite like your sword you have a vast pool of swords you can choose through as you level up and get more swords from enemies

Solo 8.5/10
Multiplayer 9/10"
26373,"Didn't like it at first, but then I played through the entire game in a day with a friend. Best with others! (Red Knight Magic doe :3)"
26374,"I would positivley recommend this game if you are more of the kind of person who skips cutscenes just to play the game. Otherwise, Awesome game. 

Pros-
+ Extremely Fun in Multiplayer
+ The music was fantastic. This game led to one of my favourite artists. (Waterflame)
+ The stupidity of the ""Story"".

Cons-
- What Story?
- Combat is expoitable and repetitive."
26375,"gamenya bagus 
tapi bingung"
26376,"How 2 Castle Crash

Kill enemies to save princess
Let your friend steal your princess
Repeat Process until the end of the game


You've succefully Castle Crashed."
26377,Alahu aKBAR
26378,"Pretty cheap on Sale
Play it with Friends ! (Up to 4 Players)
You will have fun for atleast 8hours

9/10"
26379,"I remember when first purchasing this on my xbox360 because i thought it was cool, and i'm not dissapointed. :)
I like this game.
I feel like it's better to play this if you have friends or atleast someone else to play this with."
26380,It's one of the funiest platform game which I ever played. Great multiplayer! I would like to try end the game with all characters. I strongly recommend Castle Crashers!
26381,I love it <3 One of the best 10/10
26382,Great game for having fun with friends :D Love it !!
26383,Amazing to play w/ your girlfriend
26384,this is a fun game to play with your friends
26385,"Mash buttons, kill your friends, kiss the princess. What more can you need?"
26386,I think this is a realy fun game but only if you have friends to play with. If you don't I do not recomend this game because almost noone plays online. But overall a realy fun game to play with friends
26387,"Sigh. Where do I start?
Castle crashers is a jule for me, same with a lot of people. It dose have a repetive game though. Yet, Theres something just about the beat 'em up games that I loved, and I feel like this game puts it out there the most. With the wide choice of characters, there is almost no limit. Anyone with a love for the cartonny, yet dark humor, would adore this game. Words can not express how much time i've put into this game on the X-Box 360, and the soundtrack is Beautiful. 

Pros:
Great community.
Wide range of characters.
Co-op.
Soundtrack.

Cons:
Repetiteve.
Lots of grinding in the works.
Insane mode is almost impossible.

I really do suggest this game, its also cheap. 





And screw Ice King. Wow is he annoying."
26388,"Really fun game. But I wouldn't recommend getting the PC version here. As it STILL thinks it's an Xbox game, and tells you to press the controls of an Xbox controller. But if you happen to know how to hook one up to PC, or you can adapt and figure it out with a keyboard.....then go for it."
26389,"Now yes, i know there is not many differences from remastered and the original, but ive played through the original game with my cousin and damn was it a hell of a ride. Caste Crashers is one of my all time favorite indie games and will stay in my heart forever"

26394,A fun and good game! Just like Battleblock Theater.
26395,"This is a fun adventure game for people with big imaginations. This game is fun for all ages and has a basic storyline that anyone can follow. It doesn't require much computing power and is very interactive. You can play online and with freinds, or even on your own computer with a controller or a keyboard. I HIGHLY recommend this game."
26396,9.5/10
26397,"It gets mental once you and your friends get the opportunity to bash each other's skull to kiss a princess

Also, you get to escape a giant fluffly monster on a deer's back
plot twist: the deers actually have diarrhea when you ride it

I'm not even kidding. Just play it guys."

26402,fun with ppl
26403,it sucks lmao
26404,10/10 would decapitate all my friends again and kiss a clown princess.
26405,This game is a total gem. keeps my family and I entertained for hours. Just grab some Xbox controllers and GO!!!!
26406,Great game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
26407,"It's really fun when you play it with your friends, but if you don't have friends it's still really fun especially when you're bored."
26408,10/10 would be a knight again
26409,A fun crash and bash. Get 4 of you on the go and you'll have a blast!
26410,Good Game
26411,best hack'n'slash rpg ever
26412,Great side scroler adventure with fun graphics. Plan to play though multiple times.
26413,"Horrifically slaughtered all of my friends for a clown.
I can still hear their screams as I mercilessly beheaded them.
Electrocuted them.
Maimed them.
Sliced them into oblivion.

And that is a small price to pay for a clown.

10/10"
26414,"Where do I even fucking start.
This is a 2D masterpiece. So many hours of joy, countless on my 360.
Played with so many friends, replayed many times.
Soundtrack I listen to monthly.
This holds a place in my heart."
26415,"I might have little playtime on the pc, but i have played countless hours on the PS3 version and i can tell you that you can sink endless hours into this game."
26416,The game is one of the best I have ever played! It's epic. Just that. Hilarious scenes and weapons. I also love the story.
26417,Really fun game if you can get 4 friends together. Only problem is that it seems to get insanely laggy if you get more than 2 players together :/ .
26418,awsome!!!!!!!
26419,"Another addictive casual game. Super satisfying to beat once, but not much replay value after you beat it a few times. Great for mindless fun with friends."
26420,"Classic game, incredible memories playing this game with family and friends."
26421,You can play beach volleyball. I'm sold.
26422,Really fun and funny coop experience.
26423,"noice, very noice"
26424,I really like this game and have had really a lot of fun. on a scale of 1-10 i would give it a solid 9. but that is only because of the some what 2d nature of the game
26425,"After Alien Hominid, Behemoth Decided To Make This Gem Of A Game. In My Opinion, This Is The Game That Put Behemoth On The Map. Castle Crashers Can Be Played With One Player, But It Is Best Experienced By Playing Multiplayer (Which Is Why I Baught The 4 Pack). Once You Have Completed The Game, Your Adventure Is Not Over, After The Main Story You Can Go Back And Unlock More Character, Animal Friends, And Even Insane Mode. Overall, I Would Give Castle Crashers A 9.5/10."
26426,"Fun beat 'em up game that has a nice accompanying soundtrack and has great sound effects for when you're slapping enemies around. The character design is nice, and I really the big goofy expressions of some of the characters too. 

My biggest complaint about it is that ""hard mode"" is really just playing the same game over again except enemies have ten times more damage and health, which makes it tedious and not fun at all. Also, the magic of a lot of the characters you can play are very similar, and don't have the same kind of variety as the 4 knights, so it gives you a false sense of variation."
26427,"Super great fun time. I like long time. Sake make funnest.


In all seriousness this is a pretty fun game. I really like couch games because i have a nine year old and anything we bothcan play is a huge bonus! This company makes great games, Battle Block Theatre is another games by them and although it is very different it shares the same tone and it is the tone of these games that take them from above average to Super Great Fun Time. If you like 2d side scrolling arcade style games you will love this game. It is double dragon for a new generation.. well 2012's new generation anyway. Same humor as robot chicken or something like that. You level up as you play spending skill points and also gain new abilities, combos, and magic as you go. You also unlock pets (really just a small bonus that follows you around),new weapons and playable characters. Boss battles can be frustrating sometimes and i do wish they had an easier difficulty levelfor younger players because once my daughters guy dies its like every two minutes i have to revive her charachter. I wish coop games would have an individual difficulty level for different players. While i don't want an increase for my self because even with the increased amount of NPC's attacking me due to her running around doing little kid things rather than fighting all the time, she would benifit from yaking less damage or coming back to life with more health. Once she dies the first time its just a small matter of time before i am overwhelmed and can't revive her right away. Since i don't know of any CoOp games with that sort of thing i cant fault the game at all so i would give it 8.5 stars."
26428,Best Arcade 2D
26429,if u dont have friends riperino better than kony 2012 best thinkg to come out of 2012
26430,The most fun Arcade game I have ever played. Before transfering to PC I put in hundreds of hours on this game on Xbox. Fun for all and the most fun if played with friends.
26431,"Killed all my friends, killed all the baddies, made love with all the women, all while weilding a cardboard tube....

Best. Game. Ever!"
26432,A must have for anyone really.
26433,Nice game.
26434,"Great game,it's fun a bit short but definitely has more stuff like multiplayer so yer buy it"
26435,"One of the best party games I've ever played. The game has a massive amount of detail and polish to it. The game is short to an extent but you will be replaying it around 5-6 times just to unlock everything, if not more! I have completed this on Xbox 360 multiple times, so ignore my time played.

I give it 10/10 Prunes"
26436,TRASH GAME
26437,"It is really fun, but once you finish the story and collect all the pets and weapons, there is nothing to do. I think it should have some frequent updates every once in a while. Add some new pets, another story (side story), new weapons and etc."
26438,one of the best
26439,it is just pure AWSOMENESS
26440,"Really fun game I would recommend it if you like a different style without all the ""indie"" junk and actually have friends to play this with."
26441,Love the game so much I grinded for a full day waiting for  some of my friends to  get on =P
26442,This game is gud
26443,Childhood game. Still good even after so many years.
26444,"It's pretty good, but two things ruin it for me...

- Can't switch and play as different characters without essentially starting over with them. With so many unlockable characters, what's so hard about letting us choose another one so we can level them up in the same save game?

- One life and no checkpoints when you reach bosses in single player. Having to start over from the very beginning of a level because you died once at the boss fight in the end is not challenging, it's tedious... it seriously should just start you at the beginning of the boss fight. I get this is meant to be played with friends since players can revive eachother (at least Magicka had some kind of alternative), but it shouldn't seem like a requirement."
26445,you crash castles
26446,"A four-player 2D hack and slash game set in a medieval universe. A king sends a group of loyal knights to take down an evil wizard who kidnapped his daughters and stole a mystical gem.

Castle Crashers is extremely enjoyable for a number of reasons. The gameplay feels satisfying and rewarding throughout your journey, you beat up various enemy types which earn you levels/skill points that can be used to upgrade your four primary attributes: Strength, Magic, Defense and Agility. As you progress, you’ll also obtain new weapons with their own individual stats and discover animal orbs who'll aid you in a certain form.

Along with its distinct and visually-pleasing cartoon art style, cute and light-hearted humour, iconic soundtrack and overall thrilling story, the game has so much charm to it. Moreover, there's some side content if you feel you haven't gotten enough out of the main game, such as Insane Mode (story mode on a higher difficulty, requires Normal Mode completion to unlock) and a mini-game called Back Off Barbarian.

Despite it's short, it's a classic, one of my favourite games of all time and I think my hours show this. Though, I advise waiting for a sale since the original price is fairly dear for the content offered. I also suggest playing with friends since it's quite boring playing alone."
26447,This game is great to play with family. Every time my girlfriend and her sister visit we all play and fight for the fair maiden!
26448,Its like Football but without the foot and the ball
26449,Great cartoony beat me up game with fun multiplayer  gameplay and colorful graphics
26450,这是刷刷刷游戏？
26451,"Great game,
There is not much to say.
Just grab your friends and enjoy the game."

26453,"It's the perfect game to play with friends in a summer afternoon
I recommend it on sale

Good also for your toaster pc!"
26454,"Couch co-op, online co-op, however you play it its a hell of a lot of fun!(as long as you have friends to play with) 10/10 would get friends again"
26455,"Love this game, totally didnt make me wanna drink myself ;). but i truelly enjoyed it and thought that it was a very fun game to play"
26456,game was so good I bought it twice
26457,10/10 one of the best games ever made its dead if you are looking for multiplayer this game is mostly solo/single player its so funny and fun best when you have friends to play with
26458,ONE OF MY BEST GAME IN MY LIFE             THIS COMPANY BUILD VERY GOOD GAME
26459,"Really fun Beat em Up game. With slight RPG elements the mechanics of the game is  really fun, a lot of replay value to max lvl all the characters and to get new characters. Goofy but can be taken seriously the story is pretty good(Its a behemoth game what do  you expect). Really fun game to play with freinds and such."
26460,"I really enjoyed this game, especially the multiplayer. Challenging, but still fun to play."
26461,"JIHADISTS IF YUH LOKKING FOR A REVIEW ON THIS GAME THEN U'EV COME TO THE WRONG PLACE,BUT IF U R LOOKING FOR THE RECIPE FOR THE BEST CHAR SUI PORK U'R IN THE RIGHT PLACE

Ingredients
 
Meat
800g pork shoulder or belly, sliced with the grain into 5cm-wide strips
For the Marinade
½ tbsp honey
½ tbsp light soy sauce
1½ tbsp dark soy sauce
½ tbsp rice wine
1 tbsp hoisin sauce
1 tsp sesame oil
3 tbsp soft brown sugar
1 clove garlic, roughly chopped
A pinch of five-spice powder (optional)
For the glaze
2 tbsp honey


Method

1. In a large bowl, mix all the marinade ingredients with the pork. Cover and chill overnight. 
2. The next day, preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas mark 4. Line a baking tray with non-stick paper and set a wire rack on top. Arrange the pork on the rack, leaving at least 2cm between each strip. Keep the leftover marinade nearby. Roast the pork for 20 minutes, then brush with the leftover marinade, turn, brush the other side and roast for a further 20 minutes until the pork is cooked and a deep red-amber colour, and the marinade has dried out. 
3. Switch the oven setting to the grill. Mix the honey and 2 tablespoons of boiling water together in a bowl. Remove the tray from the oven and brush the glaze over the pork. Return the tray to the top shelf and grill with the door slightly ajar for 2–3 minutes until the edges blacken slightly, and there are tiny beads of glaze foaming on the surface. Turn and repeat for the other side. 
4. Leave the pork to cool to room temperature, then slice into 3mm slices to show off the crimson ring around the outer edge, fanning out the slices to emphasise the effect if you wish, and serve."
26462,"its fun to play with friend.
but its sucks to play alone"
26463,"If you think solo if fun, then you haven't played multiplayer

10/10 would beat up my friends to kiss a princess again"
26464,One of my favorite games.
26465,Fun
26466,"This is a very funny game! Cute little soldier rescue little princess, and the ungly enemies look funny"
26467,love that game!
26468,"Fun game, especially with friends, it is heavily reccomended to play it with friends.
Simple game, fun bossfights, and some good jokes as well :D."
26469,"Castle Crashers is a great game, an instant classic. 
Pros
-Simple
-Easy and Fun to Play
-Funny and Light Hearted
-Suprisingly Good Graphics

Cons
-Lack of smoothness and balance in some areas. For example, on some levels you get all the way to the end for a boss fight. It takes, say, 10 minutes to get there. You die at the boss fight and you have to restart the whole level. It gets annoying to be stuck on one part over and over. 
-It can be inconsistent or unclear. For example, to break open a treasure chest or a wall to continue a level, you need to be in an exact position or spot for it to work. Sometimes this means you'll get stuck in an area swinging your sword around blindly because you weren't in the right spot to bust a wall open. 

[b]Nonetheless[/b]
this is a really fun game. The developers of this game are awesome imo. They know how to just make a good old fashioned video game that's fun, has levels, boss fights, a story and a little bit of humor."
26470,"Its so good!

You want 2-D Side scrolling action? You want Hack n slash but 2-D? You want cleverly in game made jokes by the developers? You want fun, infuriating, addictive gameplay?

BUY TEH FUCKING GAME."
26471,"Amazing Game Anyone Would Love It
"
26472,"I really like this game,but you shouldnt play it alone,its makes more fun if you play it with your friends"
26473,Good gameplay but I think there should be a reset option because there are limited amounts of characters each with their own special someone may want an character which is already taken.
26474,"I very much recommend this game. It is great, hands down, and has a lot of time to offer. My hours seem low, only because I played this game to death on the Xbox. Each character has its own type of attacks, spells, and some even feature different animations for their bow shot. 

The humor is sometimes childish, such as poo jokes, but otherwise, it’s a pretty fun and funny experience. The bosses of the stages are pretty unique and have really nice art styles. IIRC, none of the bosses had reused combat techniques. One boss stands out in memory as made of win, which is the corn cob boss.
"
26475,From what I have played of this game I have loved it. I remember playing at a friends house a few years ago and had so much fun. I would recomend this game to everyone interested in buying it.
26476,"Castle Crashers is a fun game to play with friends. It has elements for players in Co-op multiplayer fun. In my opinion this game is easy to pick up and play but will have you, friends fighting for love making broken friendships last... Brings back old memories when I first got the game on PS3 and Xbox 360. I really like this game and I would recommend others to buy it."
26477,this game is crazy fun
26478,"i may not have a lot of playtime here on steam, but that's because before getting it here, i had it on ps3. After my ps3 broke and i saw this game on sale on steam, i couldnt resist.
Hours of fun. and the best of all LOCAL MULTIPLAYER!
I'm only reviewing it now ebcause I've been playing it a lot recently with my new roommate who has a projector and a steam link.
It feels like I'm back in my mother's basement playing it on the ps3 with friends.

The game has everything you want: tons of unlockables, fun gameplay, pvp, mini games. Seriously just play this with friends and beer and you'll have fun all knight!!! (intentional pun)"
26479,"crashing those castles, its ok"
26480,This is an interesting game.It requires cooperation and it is cooperation that intrigues me!
26481,"Make sure you are the one that gets to kiss the last princess, it makes all the comical grinding worth it!"
26482,Poop jokes. 11/10 would kiss [spoiler]clown princess[/spoiler] again.
26483,:)
26484,Great with friends

26488,"This game is really fun to play with friends, if you have some."
26489,i really like this game. ive gotten really far and theres lots of challenges. i cant wait to win this on insane mode it will be so fun. most of all i love playing with my friends.
26490,Excellent game. one of the biggest hits fir the xbox store. This game is my child hood :ccknight:
26491,"I could hardly play the game. If you're going to make a 3d beat-em-up, make the graphics 3d. I was stumbling and couldnt get a grasp on the controls because of the confusing visuals. Im moving in three dimensions- but the graphics are 2d. Because of that, i dont know where i am or how to position myself."
26492,":o it is a good game to play with friends groups it better



                                    thanks"
26493,"CRASH ME DADDY 

jk its pretty good"
26494,fun game i just think its way over priced 4 what it is.
26495,If you don't have any friends. Don't play this game.
26496,"ran to castle

26497,this crashed my castle
26498,"Awful combat and level design, the devs should be ashamed of this shiity game they created."
26499,"I love this game! It feels like the TMNT arcade game that I used to play on snes (that is a horrible comparison of the game but its just personal experience), but now I can connect with friends online."
26500,Good Game :) it is great and i hope everyone buys it cuz its cool and its fun and you should but it cuz its fun and cool..... and stuff
26501,"I love the game, very fun and somewhat addictive. Though the only small problem is that it gets a little repetitive."
26502,Fun Co-Op
26503,"I love this freakin game so much because you have all these different Charaters and lots of different enemys to face. Personaly, my favorte character is the alien guy because of his blaster which can do alot of damage (dependiing on the enemy) other than that, I think the game is great"
26504,It's really fun!
26505,10/10 would serach for 10 min to find a match.
26506,"Really cool, it' s like a little Dark Souls :3


vote: 8.5/10"
26507,8/8 Waterflame's music
26508,"I see Castle Crashers cute and at the same time brutal. I like the original humor in this game, the challenges it brings and the original and disturbing style and I must admit I can't enjoy playing it without my friends."
26509,Great couch co-op game. a ton of fun. overall a great game to play with some buddies.
26510,"Everything is amazing. Love the music, love the action, love the humor. One of the better beat'em ups of all time :D"
26511,its a nice game.
26512,"Castle Crashers is a pleasant conglomerate of medieval-based fighting, magic, and poop jokes that's best played with friends.  

Pros--
>Approachable and decently challenging in difficulty
>Goofy and fun graphics
>Tons of characters and unlocks
>Leveling up only agility

Cons--
>Corn boss
>Most of the fighting is a test of how long you can juggle enemies
>FUCK corn boss dude

Well worth the money."
26513,One of the best couch party games ever!
26514,Vei esse jogo eu joguei quando lançou para o ps3 joguei zerei com praticamente todos personagens ai um belo dia eu vi que tinha para steam e comprei cara so vo falar uma coisa esse jogo e uma dlç principalmente para jogar com amigos SO JOGUE COM CONTROLE PQ N TECLADO E RUIM PRA CRL.
26515,i dont have what to write about this lovely game !
26516,"Castle Crashers was the game back then! It came out long ago, so I'll defend it, by mentioning the fact that the tools used now to create video games, compared to ""long ago"", are just plain better.

That aside, that doesn't make CC any worse. CC is a great game. It had a great combat system, unique character magic, characters and weapons. The weapons are mainly cosmetics that change your stats. Aside from these facts, certain character magic abilities, such as the arrow storm, are used across a few of them. The boss fights are great to.

Insane mode exists to. I use the keyboard controls, they aren't bad, it's just people don't want to get used to it. Sure, I can ""Tornado juggle"", ""Sand juggle"", combine it, if thats the only way people will believe me, ""spellweave"", etc. But let's be honest here. By joining random games, people never get the ""hint"" to start a lvl 1 character, or play a character near your level. You won't progress if you don't play the exact mission your on, and theres no indicator for that in online play. You could, however, fight over what stage to pick. 

That aside, a fair rating for this game, considering its release date and the like, 

10/10.

There are ""NEW"" games out there, in reality, most are just built on the same system of the previous. Those new games are what I call complete crap. They're all the same. At least, only a few aren't. And don't forget the RNG these days."
26517,The game is okay if it is on sale. Multi player is probably a lot more fun than single player.
26518,This was easily one of my favorite games of all time.
26519,"Castle Crashers is an incredable solo play and even better with friends, local or not it provides a good laugh whilst providing genuinely challenging gameplay. It's a call back to retro beat em up games such as streets of rage done right. With RPG elements to spice up and improve the already fine tuned gameplay"
26520,Absolutly fun. Great party game to play with friends and/or family!
26521,Really fun game just buy it and play you will have a fun time!!!!
26522,The best way to steal a crocodile from your friend
26523,This is a very fun beat em' up type game to play with friends.
26524,im a little late ro the party to review but this is my favourite indie game ever i love you tom fulp and dan palidan!!!!
26525,"Funny, great game. Something I enjoy playing with friends but can get boring by yourself"
26526,this game is amazing
26527,Great game its just not as fun when your alone but its still a great game!
26528,"-Side scrolling beat em up
-Cool story
-Fun minigames
-Multiplayer rocks
-Hours of fun
-Varity of characters"
26529,"Fun with friends, saddening to play alone."
26530,It is one of the best games I have ever played. Funny animations and perfect autor s ideas will keep you playing it.
26531,clash of clans ripoff
26532,"This is by far one of my favorite games, art style is great, jokes and scenes arent stale and the randomness is the best part. 11\2"
26533,Red knight magic... that's all I have to say.
26534,"I played hours of this game with my family when I was younger. I cannot think of a reason to not recommend this game. 

(I made it to level 87 with the pointy-headed buzz saw guy, with no cheats)."
26535,"Its fun until you beat it, then its boring af"
26536,Great game for me and my daughter to play!
26537,this game is great and is even better with friends!!
26538,"This is a must have if you're looking for local coop games. The more the merrier, so be sure to get some pals to join you !"
26539,i loved this
26540,"Castle Crashers. I honestly wouldn't recommend this. Its fun with one playthrough, but after that, even with nightmare mode, it just isn't very fun. All nightmare mode does is force you to dodge more and to swing more than you would for each stage. A lot of the pets are really weak and a few are really strong. Multiplayer is interesting at the end of certain stages (Won't spoil too much)"
26541,Meh
26542,"Really fun game, can't stop playing, couldn't recommend enough"
26543,"Loved that they made this game available for PC play. The default key bindings are wonky and I feel they were poorly chosen for someone without a controller. This game really isn't difficult without a controller, I'm not sure why they are pushing for one so hard. An easy recustomization of your key bindings isn't too hard. 

Fun overall old gem of a game. It was great for the era it came out in and is still fun to replay to this day."
26544,THIS IS AWESOME!
26545,Funny and fun to play. Give it a go
26546,hi i like it
26547,It's too easy.
26548,"It's fun, but if you don't play with friends, then it's not that fun.
I recommend playing with a controller."
26549,Approves
26550,10/10. Fricking swag OG game. Plz buy
26551,"Thx team newgrounds for making these great games.
Caste crashes is a high end local ccop game sidescrolling, challenging and funny game.

Castle crashers is shurely one of the funniest games ever made."
26552,not gay but ok
26553,I recommend to all!! 10/10
26554,This is a unique experience for me while playing
26555,"Me And My two Friends deicideded to get this game. 10 hours later and I've finished the game -1 one friend. Rest In Piece his account. We then tried to speedrun. I guess speedrunning games isnt for me... 

Now Battleblock theater is another challenge for me to face. I hope i can get through it."
26556,Is a really fantastic game. is for those who loves imaginative things and is also good even if u re a bit too big to play video games. Really Good
26557,"GOTY OF THE YEAR. OF THE DECADE...

OF FOREVER!!!!"
26558,"It's fun and thrilling, I enjoyed the suprises I got from the game as well as how leveling up came with a sense of actual achievment, as it unlocked new abilities and weapons. The game does not take long to complete, but it's worth buying."
26559,"Fun game. Unique graphics. Plotline unoriginal. Cool pets. Pretty glitchy. Combo up walls.

Back off barbarian is way too hard.

Arena is annoying due to lack of players.

Story mode is fun but is repetitive. Run around, beat some guy up, move on.

Summary 

This game is good if you are into beating guys up, or just looking to do so with friends. Other than that it's pretty boring."
26560,brilliant game!
26561,"This is a fun game
i dont play much since i have no one to play with (hints the low play time)
yet its a bit challenging if ur not good at close combat games"
26562,It is nice and funny but it is WAY TOO SHORT !
26563,"I'd imagine this game wouldn't have nearly as fun if it weren't for the co-op. I won't deny the charm that the cartoony visuals have, or the coherent gameplay mechanics etc., but multiplayer is where this game really becomes thrilling and joyous. Perhaps it's not a fantastic display of game-making marvel, but it doesn't need to be - it's far from perfect, but a damn good joyride while it lasts. Minor cons: disappointingly short length, some annoying bosses (not hard per se)."
26564,"Mitmit bought this, +1 great game."
26565,Great Beat 'em up game with great bosses. Really fun with friends 9/10 would recomend.
26566,THE FRICKEN' BEST GAME EVER! BUY IT NOW!
26567,Great game to pick up
26568,"Castle Crashers is side scroll hack 'n slash game. Main concept is builded on the idea of Co-Op. So if you are looking for some Coop game to play with your friends go ahead and quickly grab this game. If not ,well stick with me.


This game is probably one of the best combinations of hack 'n slash and side scroll.While SP is amazing too, maximum fun can be achieved with laid back coop partner. Graphics , game humour and gameplay just dances with a beautiful harmony. [b] Must have [/b] game in your library."
26569,Nice.
26570,"beat the game in a day, yeah its pretty fun."
26571,"Beating the crap out of thiefs with butthole shaped hoods has never been more fun.

It's just a shame that the online is somewhat dead."
26572,10/10
26573,Great if you have friends to play with.Give it a go !
26574,"i recommend castle crashers for the following reasons:
*the first reason is the artstyle of the game, the game looks visually appealing in my eyes, and it is fun to look at the enviroment and at npc's in the area.
*the gameplay is fun and can be challenging
*LOTS of weapons
*Animals taking shit"
26575,It smells like Newgrounds humour and that's why this game is worth it.
26576,"Your classic, fun arcade style slasher game. I would rate it 87/100. It is probably a bit expensive, so preferably get it during a sale, but overall a great game."
26577,it is a very fun game
26578,"Ayyyyyy... dis is pretty good

Favorite Characters: Fencer and Brute gg bois

Tips: 
-to do a sick flying thing use light,heavy,heavy combo in the air(helps to have magic jump)
-to juggle the shit out of light and medium weight enemies use light,light,heavy,heavy combo against their skulls(because edgy)
-magic and agility op, unless character has shit magic then just agility :D

Note: You're probably gonna get carpal tunnel from playing this too much, I recommend some nice wrist stretches to help prevent that :D"
26579,"this game is awesome i hope it gets a lot of love
and i want it to be the best game ever good job game makers"
26580,"this game is fun it is obviously made by those guys who dont like cats in battleblock theatre. you play as ...way too much fuc*ing characters and have to free beautiful princesses from assh*les so it is obvious how this game gonna end. you have a great arsenal with weapons and the gameplay is fun  and covered in dark humour . It is fun to play alone but aswell online the music is pretty ok and the art as well it is cartoonish but cute. Sadly it gets boring after some hours because it is the same thing, go buy potions and spam the magicattack button that is all .i would buy this on sales but otherwise idk. it is good tho

7/10"
26581,good game very fun and funny
26582,"If you're up for wasting enjoyable time with friends, Castle Crashers is one of the games you should try out.
It's colorful, filled with action and cute too! Especially with the companions you can bring along and find as you play.
Definitely a must play and buy!"
26583,i love this game its so fun
26584,Very good game. Fun to play with my kids. Thanks to my good friend mauxfaux for gifting me this.
26585,"Fun arcade game, it is definatley strange but for sure amazing!"
26586,We just need a castle crashers 2. The adventure is so amazing to experience with friends. We need a sequal. NOW!!!
26587,Nice! :D
26588,"mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmsgood

multiplayer is empty tho )^:"
26589,Castle Crashers is one of my fav games i love it and is very fun ive played it for 84 hours i also really like battle block theater which is the game before this and really think you should give this a shot :D
26590,I don't have friends to play with ):
26591,"I would overly describe my experience with this game as a very fun pass time with a friend, younger sibling, etc. I first played this game in another state at my cousins house with my little brother. My little brother and I manadged to get through about half of the game. Well when we got home I instantly bought it on my ps3 at the time; and finished it. The game manages to be very laybacked then intense very fluidly. As well as constantly keeping it fun/cynical tone through out the entire game. The game is a must play with a friend, but by yourself I would say it isn't worth it. I say get it when its in a sale. I however never played this game by itself and it might be just as fun in single player as it was in multiplayer. But in my opinion this is one of the best couch games with a friend I've ever played."
26592,Hot
26593,This game taught me that more poop equals more speed
26594,"Very fun game for couples or friends to enjoy. Or if you are a loser like me, you can play through the whole story by yourself.

Pros:
+Cute Graphics
+Great BGM
+Very fun PVE and PVP experience
+Good story
+Numerous Items and Pets, many ways to customize

Cons:
-Low replay value
-Some what high price for a indie game
-Lag issues in online multiplayer

Do i recommend this game? Certainly."
26595,"Best game i've played, GREAT plot line and i love the tectures and the game modes. VERY FUN to play."
26596,"although I have not played this game much i am planning on completing it as in getting every playable character and beating the game with them. This game is extremely fun and i would most definately reccomend it to players who love a good challenge and just to screw around and have fun.

-I reccomend to play with friends"
26597,"This game is really fun, like the other games by The Behemoth! The gameplay is really fun, and the humor is great!"
26598,Fun for people who have bad computers !
26599,Like skyrim but its happy
26600,awesome game
26601,"i played this game with tanner, chummy, spucko and myself and it was a bad time overall, we all got hurt. worst flash game ever"
26602,"Was pooped on by owl.

"
26603,Fun and addicting game for the whole family.
26604,"out of my almost 15 hours in this game its a work of art.


10/10 would cheat again
"
26605,"Really don't understand the positive reviews on this game. The graphics looks great, yes, but the game is just a chore to play. Enemies take 9 million hits to kill and they fire arrows at you like nobody's business, so I spent 60% of my playtime on the ground getting back up. It's just not that much fun to play."
26606,i use to play this a lot on my old 360 but its still as fun as i remembered
26607,"Ladies and Gentlemans...and plebs . This game is build on fecal fun soo.... if you dont like shits and you want to play something serious - Go play minecraft (kappa)
I like this game soo much ,because I've got lot of fun with my teammates when We are playing this !"
26608,"Two main things first up: -

1)  The advertising is wrong.  This is isometric 3D for nearly the whole game, not 2D.
2)  Do have an X-Box controller if you buy this game.  The game is far more difficult and less enjoyable if you don't.

   The game shows you don't need a complex plot to make a great game.  Evil Wizard has attacked castle and kidnapped four princesses.  Your job (and that of up to three of your mates) is to go out there, beat up the bad guys, and rescue the princesses.  The game is effectively ""Double Dragon Medieval"".  You don't get to use the scenery as weapons but you do have archery, magic, fast or heavy melee options, jumping, attacks combos, different weapons, and pets that give you bonuses.  The game is reasonably fast paced - two to three massed minion attacks, mini boss, two to three more massed minion attacks, big boss.

    The key game mechanic is experience points with which you can build strength (melee attacks do more damage), power (magic does more damage and recharges quicker), defence (enemy attacks do less damage), and speed (move quicker and srchery does more damage).  This means the more you play, the tougher your character gets, and the easier the enemies become.  It's quite fun playing from the start with high level characters who easily demolish the starting opposition.

   The game's graphics are bright and colourful, the different soundtracks for each stage are bouncy and fun.  The enemies change regularly so the games doesn't become too monotonous but there are few foes that cannot be beaten with melee combos and dodge (that said there are a small number of mini bosses and big bosses from whom you need to keep your distance and a decent magic attack becomes essential).

    Any negatives ?

    1) The dev's humour is basic and scatological.  If you have a strong aversion to poo jokes this will be a negative.
    2)  Minor spoiler - Some of the bad guys look like angry golliwogs.  Coupled with the knights' outfits that aren't too dissimilar  from the KKK this has caused accusations of racism.  Of course the KKK costumes are reminiscent of medieval knights which is the more likely inspiration for the game.  One of the princesses is definitely black.  Personally I'm not sure.  Compared with ""Birth of a Nation"" the game is ""Sesame Street"" but only an idiot wouldn't have recognised that someone would have been upset by the imagery.  Personally I can live with it and still enjoy it as a medieval Double Dragon but I give you warning in case you won't.

S.x.

"
26609,"Dis Iz Amazing, whoa diggety dogety
"
26610,"Another gem in the cave of side scrolling beat 'em ups, made by the fabulous Behemoth Team. I loved BattleBlock Theater, it made me rage my ass off. This game made me rage my ass off aswell. At volleyball. I rate this game 10/10 and I can't wait for Pit People to come out!!"
26611,"Buy this game, and you will get the ability to fly IN REAL LIFE! :D"
26612,"Pretty fun game, much better with friends than alone though. Really creative environments, good balancing, satisfying combat, great and memorable bosses, really anything you could want.

While the art is good, the environments are kinda a clusterfuck and most of the difficulty of the game comes from trouble either finding your opponent or distinguishing them from the background, especially in the late game. It can be hard to fight off a massive horde of foes, and tough to take down a crazy tanky boss, but at the end of the day I most struggled against the backgrounds themselves and trying just to find my enemies. Maybe this isn't as big a problem in singleplayer, but with 4 people it's super hard to find you enemies.

Good brawler though, and definitely earns its place among the indie giants. Very fun and memorable. Even if a little annoying."
26613,its cool
26614,10/10 would play
26615,"Tons of fun with a few friends. The humor is great and the gameplay is solid. If you like beat-em-up games, then Castle Crashers is a must buy."
26616,good Game to play withfriends
26617,"Really like it! A good 8/10!
PROS:
- Fun to play with friends
- Awesome Combat
- Challenging Bosses
- Humor ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
- Online mode
- A HUGE variety in swords and other weapons
the pros list goes on and on

CONS:
- Not much variety in gameplay
- THAT DAMN TROLL MOTHER BOSS ON INSANE MODE
- To unlock characters, you have to play the game over again
- Not really woth 15 dollars
"
26618,this game.... i recommend it. Its the best game ive played on my computer. it doesnt take a good computer to play so it's perfect 10/10
26619,This games is fun easy to learn. The only mian problem is that you really need a controller or it is hard
26620,4/10 Boring game when you play second time :/
26621,"My sister gifted me this game to commemorate my joining Steam way back when, and I have to say it is probably the best gift I have ever received. After going from limited access to full access, I even went as far as to get my friend to purchase a copy and play together. The game itself is quite hard alone, but band together with your friends and you are in for one heck of a time.

[u]Overview[/u]

         Castle Crashers being a great side scrolling beat 'em up game brings a simple, yet gameplay. The artwork is something I have come to enjoy it very much. Others prefer purchasing through sales, sure, but I for one believe it was worth the $15. The downloadable content is completely optional and playing the game without them is completely fine, as they only bring an additional character each. With the soundtrack and atmosphere, you can get a great sense of casual adventure as you set off to save princesses with a variety of bizarre enemies and crazy bosses.

[u]Pros[/u]
         [list]
         [*] Average learning curve
         [*] Lots of humor
         [*] Cartoon artstyle
         [*] A bunch of characters to unlock
         [*] The more people you have to play with you, the funner it gets
         [*] [i]Climatic[/i] fights between allies to determine who gets the princess' kiss
         [*] A couple of game modes added along with the original campaign mode
         [/list]

[u]Cons[/u]
         [list]
         [*] Online co-op with randoms is nearly non-existent
         [*] Combat can get repetitive with what how important juggling is
         [*] Playing alone can get depressing if going through a long playthrough
         [/list]"
26622,"one of the best games ive ever played i know i dont have a lot of hours but i dont need many hours to have fun with this game one hour feels like 4 hours you dont need anything for your controller you just simply plug it in and the game has controller support built in
its a great game to play with friends
but solo just as fun
when you complete it you can challenge yourself and try insane mode which usally isnt that hard compared to the normal but damn i had troubles trying to completing insane 
definatly worth your money and a great game overall"
26623,"Its realy good  the coop action was great and it is basic adventure 

The Creaters of this are realy good i hope theres a second castle crashers 


"
26624,"WARNING: My opinion so dont get butthurt

I loved listening to the soundtrack of the game on youtube and I enjoyed Battle Block theatre.
This game also had lots of personality.
My someone also bought me this game.


This game is poorly designed and did not pull off a ""2D/3D"" way of combat.
The combat was also mind-numbing and limited you to your class.

Are you looking for a game that is too boring to be casual? Do you lack skill or strategy? Do you have time to waste grinding on the previous level for little satisfaction? 
If you answered yes to any of these then play Castle Crashers!

 Long story short: I definatly got my moneys worth
"
26625,a good starting squad game
26626,"I played with a possibly mentally challenged friend as the blue knight, he proceeded to play on his own and level without me... I'm still better in every regard

#I AM THE BEST JACK"
26627,"I just don't like games like this, I tried to get a refund too, but i cant get one, it's not as fun as i thought. I wish steam would give me a refund. Although it was on sale, it wasnt worth it. I dont care if you get the game, this game is just not what i thought it'd be, its not as fun as i thought it'd be."
26628,"Fun fun fun. This game is a great solo or coop experience. It is sooo fun and satisfying to hack and slash through hoards of enemies. If you can, get 4 copies of this game during a sale, because it is extra fun to play with friends. I fully recomend this game and its DLC. 9.75/10 (-.25 for having DLC in the first place)."
26629,10/10 would make deer shit again
26630,Nice
26631,ew DiS GaMe EKwLs TrSh m8 D0nT Pay pEPls i TeLl u
26632,this game is so fun but after playing the campaign once (which is roughly 7 hours of gameplay) youll probably never play it again. i would just wait until its like 80% off like i did
26633,F is for friends that do stuff together. U is for you and me.
26634,yes was very fun
26635,"Had a lot of fun, Recomend playing with friends and NOT solo."
26636,There really isn't a reason to hate this guys game so just buy it. 10/10
26637,Story and Graphics are great
26638,You need a Xbox controller after that is a 2D scroller that will leave you loving every sick joke that follows in it
26639,"  Enjoyable adventure with a good unique art style and entertaining level up system.  Obviously a lot of good time was put into this, and a lot of thought."
26640,"Love the game, the animations and overall gameplay is amazing"
26641,"i get to beat up my friends with a stick, just like real life!"
26642,is gud
26643,good game
26644,Good
26645,"THE BEST FUCKIN ARCADE GAME EVER! We Want more of these! it reminds me of the old arcade games!!! And the music is so fun O-0 ^-^ 0-O ! And you can play with friends throught multiplayer OR through lock gameplay (u will need a controller) ALSO IT HAS --->FULL<--- Controller Support!!! It totaly worth the 11 euros (i live in europe) and if you like those kind of the game YOU SHOULD TOTALY BUY IT! If You are from greece see this greek review, you will like it ---> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPF_0u5l5AY"
26646,Brought a four pack of this game for £3.96; worth every penny. Great story and gameplay.
26647,"So i just got my golden skull now here is my review, the game overall is amazing, lots of fun, lots of funny moments especialy with friends.

If your playing solo let me tell you the game will knock you out ,grab your face and just crush it into the ground countless amounts of times, if your aiming for gold skulls  3 things you need patience,determination and never give up go back and forth train alot the combos.

Online my experience is bad i always lagged in most of the lobby's or felt like i had a heavyweight on my character all the time.

Still i totaly recomend if you like beat'em up games and your looking for a little of fun :)"
26648,This game is so much fun. My favorite part honestly is the music that plays while viewing the map. That shirt [sic] slaps!
26649,"Awesome!! I know people that have spent more then 1,250 hours on the game! Even though the story is short there are ton of stuff after to do, such as, Beat the game in insane mode, unlock all the characters, unlock all the weapons, collect every animal orb, level up every character, and etc."
26650,"A really fun, and goofy game that can be enjoyable to anyone, especially when played with friends.  This game has a great lil' story line of saving X amount of princesses who were captured by some evil baddies, which obviously leads you to saving them as you progress through the game.  This game also has a LARGE character selection, and a LARGE weapon selection, as well as pets which makes the game a lil' extra entertaining.

Just the story line alone (to me), with normal and insane mode as options would be enough for this game to be a great game;  however, there are also other game modes such as PvP, eating contests, and other silly stuff you can participate in that just puts the 'cherry on top' of this game.

[b]*[/b]If you want a true challenge, first beat the game on normal, then try it on insane mode where your combos, and memorization of enemy movements (etc.) come into play :) [b]*[/b]"
26651,It is fu to play with other people
26652,amazing game!
26653,The main combat mechanic is knocking down enemies or being knocked down which effectively haults combat and progression several hundreds of times through out the course of the main story.
26654,"What's up with the negative reviews? 
This game is actually greatly ported and I can even do juggling better on keyboard, if you can play better with a controller, you should have one already so play with it! It's all in the habit, also, how did you even find negative reviews? did you... really press the negative reviews button?"
26655,"Good side-scrolling beat em' up. Pretty fun for a while, and good with friends."
26656,"Bought for only 2.99$, this is a godly game. It's the best beat-em-up style game I've ever played. The progress you make while playing with friends goes into your own character's abilities while not giving you access to every mission unless you're the host. This makes playing with friends rewarding and extremely fun to play during free time :). (the sound tracks are pretty neat too)"
26657,"Still trying to get all the characters :D 10/10
DAmm fuk those thieves."
26658,"Steam pads do not work on local multiplayer with the mac, when the second player presses A and the signal arrives it chooses the charachter for player 1. It does work fine on Windows as far as I can tell (tried both).

Cool multiplayer game. Fluent gameplay. Good humour. Minor bugs. Would not recommend it for Mac."
26659,"I absolutely loved and enjoyed this game
For one thing, the art style was gorgeous and all the characters and enemies were extremely well animated and fluid
Each level has a unique design to each other and the beat em up mechanics are really on point
I highly suggest this game, it's definitely one of the best games played in a while!"
26660,"If you get it while its on sale, 100% worth it. i personally dont recommend paying 15$ for it, its a very long game, im like 6 hours in and I only finished the first section,"
26661,is fun
26662,"This game is literlly the best. So much replay value great with friends. Love the pooping animals. Use to play this on the Xbox360
10/10"
26663,"Great game. I dont care much for if it looks real or not, I am satisfied with it. Plus you can play with friends"
26664,"A fuckwin side scrolling beat 'em up game. Lots and lots of content here, great art, great music, a ton of fun to play. An essential couch coop game."
26665,"Addicting, funny, exciting. This game has a hell of a grind but you won't mind."
26666,GREAT GAME WITH A GREAT STORY LINE MUST BUY!!!!!!
26667,"Get this game, its amazing, the combat is smooth, its a decent game to play alone, great to play with friends, just great overall get it, also theres like this big cat thing idk"
26668,"Couch co-op done right. Easy to play for kids, fun to play for adults. Highly recomended."
26669,"One of the Greatest games on the Xbox 360 i played. was shown by a friend who also loves it
"
26670,This game is fun to play with a group of friends or alone. Very few co-op games are able to do that.
26671,i dont have a controller so i want to kill myself but it's a good game and runs on my horrible computer
26672,2 dank 5 me
26673,"Game is great fun with a group of friends. Cartoony, casual, and somewhat challenging at times, Castle Crashers is a good purchase for its price. Recommended"
26674,"cools, i love it for dayz..."
26675,Just plainly AWESOME
26676,"Good ole' Castle Crashers. I played this game nonstop since the release on the Xbox, and I still play it to this day. So, I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes to play with friends, Hack and slash through waves of enemies, and likes to collect in-game stuff."
26677,"You can play as Hatty Hattington if you also own Battleblock Theatre, the best friend of all friends.

He uses Money Magic.

Buy dis and Battleblock Theatre now.

The Great Rowlett in the sky demands it.
"
26678,"I like it, it`s a good game :D"
26679,This game is fu***** good. I absolutly recommend it...
26680,<3
26681,"This is one of the best games I have ever played, it is a childish looking game with enough bloody humour to satisfy anyone. I've only played this game for a while on PC, but I finished it more than 5 times already on my X-Box.

The fact that I was willing to buy this game a second time (which clearly had nothing to do with the Steam Sale) after completing it so many times should be more than enough to prove that anyone should be downloading this beautiful game.

Btw if you are going to buy this game you should definitely choose the red knight. That character is OP as f**k."
26682,I crashed no castles
26683,So cute and fun. Animals pooping everywhere! <3
26684,"This is a beefcake of a game.

And I mean that literally.

Pros: 
1) Fun AF
2) Funny AF
3) Addicting AF
4) Teaches the benefits of eating sandwiches
5) Lots of secrets! :D

Cons:
1) Don't play this if you're lonely
2) Difficulty curve is a little....extreme
3) Testosterone levels may rise to an unsafe level when playing this game.



10/10 would beef again"
26685,behemoth
26686,"Great game!
I love this game so much!

I played this game with my friend's everyday!"
26687,"Possibly the best multiplayer game I've ever played.
The gameplay is incredibly fun and fast-paced, the combos are satisfying, there are multiple different character builds you can make using the level-up system, and there are [b] tons [/b] of unlockables, such as new characters with different move sets, new weapons with different stats and special effects, and animal orbs (essentially pets) granting you lots of different bonuses, from increasing your character's strength, through ramming down enemies, to pecking away at knocked down enemies.
The remastered edition (the edition available on steam) re-balanced lots of weapon and animal orb stats, and added a new mode called ""Back Off Barbarian"", in which you escape from constantly spawning enemies and get a rating based on the time you managed to survive.
Although the game is intended to be played in co-op, it's perfectly playable and enjoyable in singleplayer.
The game's controls work very well with a gamepad, but with some rebinding, can also be quite good on a keyboard.
The only larger flaw the game has, in my opinion, is the lack of randomly generated levels and enemies, which would add a lot to the replay value. However, the game is still very replayable thanks to tons of hidden content, such as weapons or animal orbs, making you discover something new every run.
The game's soundtrack is fantastic as well, with each area having a very fitting and enjoyable track.
The game's art style might seem basic to some, but actually works very well with the game's gameplay and feel.
Overall, the steam edition of Castle Crashers is a solid 8.5/10 for me. Would recommend to nearly everyone, even if multiplayer isn't necessarily your thing.

tl;dr: The game is very, very good. Buy it. Worth it even at full price."
26688,"ON later stages enemies are fucking stunlocking bullshit, fuck this game"
26689,"I haven't played it a lot on PC since I like to play it with people, but I've spent countless hours on the Xbox version. It isn't that serious of a game, it was more made to make you laugh and have fun with friends. I love it all the way around, just wish more people on steam played it, or I could convince my friends to buy PC controllers (keyboard controls=awkward) since I bought it for them, I love the multiplayer. Its all shits and giggles in Co-op/"
26690,"It´s good play with friends online or copperative 🎮👌👥

10/10"
26691,Lost but not forgotten great game would see shitting dear again!
26692,decent game but the boss fights are fucking retarded 4 out of 20
26693,"Played through this several times. Fantastic, pure game with a cute sense of humour."
26694,A good game to play with your friends!
26695,Crude humor. Great game for local party: 4 controllers + 1 TV.
26696,i like this game but it should not be $15
26697,Follow the pooping deer.
26698,"when will castle crashers 2 comes out? This game is sooo guuuuudddd 
i rate 10/10"
26699,"Probably one of the greatest games to have if you like Beat'em Ups! I bought this because I bought Battle Block Theatre Last year. I can honestly say that The Bethemoth makes the best Indie Games out there. These games are serverly underrated and not really heard of IMO. If you are bored and want a good game to play this is probably one of the better games to buy. The campaign was great as well, I learned a lot about animal defication and wizards and stuff. I plaued the entire game solo and had a great time (for the most part) when I played. It can be a laid back game but it is very infuriating at times. Also     ***PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER***      It might seem obvious, but please for the love of God, play this game with a controller. I played Battle Block Theater on PC without a controller for the entire campaign and had a complete fit about it. I don't even want to know what it is like to play this game without a controller.

10/10 - much better on acid and need a new Xbox Controller."
26700,the game is really fun but not 15 dollars of fun i think the game is just a little over price considering that it is really fun but gets really boring after you beat the game there isnt much to do after you beat the game other than hard mode which all it does is make the enemies harder and you get a few extra charcter/weapons but after spending a week getting every weapon and every character and then just having nothing to do i got buyers remorse because i could have just played it on my friends xbox but even still the game is fun through out the story and i recommend every to atleast play it all the way through atleast once
26701,"If you're looking for a game to play with your buds then this is it. I played this game on xbox so much that when I saw it on steam, I had to buy it all over again. 5/5 game."
26702,"Great game, very fun~!"
26703,"SinglePlayer: 8/10

"
26704,It's a great game no matter how many times you replay it. It will alwys be fun and enjoyable. I recommend this game to people used to games and new to games.
26705,Castle Crashers is a great game!
26706,"It's a very straight forward but fun multiplayer co-op game. We had to replay a few segments because of difficulty but it's definitely not hardcore. Some may find the game short, it's also not that expensive so don't cry plz. There is no replayability, arena and that new game mode are not that good when you're 2 players. I'd also say that sometimes avoiding hits and button mashing are inevitable."
26707,10/10
26708,"Beautiful, love it!

worth the whole like £2 sale price I got it for."
26709,"A game 2 git gud with dimensional stages and thinking you hit the enemy but really you're 0.0005140945 away from the actual enemy.

Fun and decently lengthed game; I enjoy the boss fights a lot.

Hard mode is just, y. Y. YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY."
26710,An awesome with tons of fun and adventure. Would totally recommend this game anyday.
26711,"It starts off kind of fun, but then you realize how repetitive and dry the game play is. I spend most of the time just mashing the two of the attack buttons and that seems to do the trick. On top of the dull gameplay, castle crashers is one of the worst ports ive ever seen, even the gta 4 port was better than this."
26712,Yes
26713,10/10 best game ever for a 2d game it was and still is worth buying it after beating the campiang and arenas its still fun to help friends and other players out or play insane mode for a challange for you or to try to get to max lvl just a well made game wouldnt say anything bad about it
26714,"This is one of the most awesome games I've ever played. 

The graphics are amazing with a unigue design and a great style. This game is really fun to play alone or with friends, and is filled with challenging bosses and enemies. It has loads of playable characters from the derpy villager to the Harcore necromancer, as well as tons of weapons with different buffs and debuffs. It's filled with content, and you can play the game over and over again without getting bored, or jump into insane mode. The level design is on point, and the soundtrack is done very well. There's even a pvp or boardgame option if you're that kind of person.

The only things I don't like are the frankly immachure humor, and the part in some levels where you kiss the princess. 

Other than that, this is an amazing game that is definitely worth the $15. I'd rate 9.5/10.

"
26715,good game
26716,"Great co-op fun, 2-4 players."
26717,Great game! You should buy it.
26718,"This is a game you have to be willing to play a while. The story is compelling and funny, and the combat is challenging and fun. There's a massive roster of characters to choose from, and each one is (mostly) unique."
26719,"Intresting, good and funny game. I have 36h in this game i done the game 1 time on normal difficulty and thats was fun. 
Intresting story abaut kings and villains.
I played with my good friend few times and thats was awesome.

Overal? 9/10. Very good game.
:)"
26720,"This Side-Scrolling Beat 'Em Up is, I have to say, the best I've played. Tight controls and feedback, silly comedy and art style, and really satisfying boss defeats, this game never gets repetitive.


Until you complete the story mode twice.
Seriously though, it's fun.
9/10"
26721,"humourous game
i like it"
26722,Top 10 anime battles
26723,"I love this game!It has a bit of humour.At times intense boss fights.Little animal buddys to help,many characters to unlock. Weapons with diffrent stats enhancers (some with a bit of decreasers). Different types of magic/abilities to use.Fun little mini-game to play. Multiplayer and controller support. If your playing with friends you can have a little friendly...
FIGHT TO THE DEATH! Little arena in the story mode of the game."
26724,"First off for me I had a normal save file but then out of the blue it was reset, then after, the game wont even SAVE I tries uninstalling the game restarting and got nothing."
26725,"this game is a ton of fun, i highly reccomend it
"
26726,Tons of fun with friends. The combat can get a bit hectic but the art and feel is like being inside a super violent cartoon set in a fantastical medieval land. Also Quaff-offs. Jesus my thumbs...
26727,GreatGame
26728,"of course i i reccomend this game the game is completely easy to run but i built my pc but my laptop is low end and it runs fine and the animation is flawless i love the humor the game's controls is easy knowing but the keybored controlls are pretty good but you can just change it with the helpful keybored and mouse setting. 
"
26729,"This wonderful game has changed my life. My relationships have vanished, everyone around me is gone, and I can't see. I love every second of it."
26730,"Partake in jolly cooperation and adventure with your friends! Along the way however, prepare to fight in the name of love..."
26731,"Really fun game, I usually play with friends, wich makes the gamemore fun. There is also an arena mode, where you can battle your friends or test your skills."
26732,10/10
26733,"For $14.99, I feel that I got my money's worth. This is by no means the BEST game, but just fun to play. It is a beat'em-up game that had a lot of button-mashing, but I never got bored while playing it. It is fun in both single-player and multi-player, especially during arena fights. There isn't much of a deep, compelling story; however, the humor and art style makes up for it. If you are looking for just fun, I would recommend this game and give it a rating of a strong 9/10."
26734,"Great!! Love this game!!
"
26735,"one of my favorite games to play with friends, the best 2d sidescroller out there in my opinion, the fights are fun, the levels and characters are interesting, and there is plenty of humor mixed in which makes the game pretty special."
26736,"only get it if you got friends to play with, not very fun alone TBH"
26737,10/10
26738,"Actually really enjoyed this game when I played it; it's really fun and easy to pick up.

Pros:
- Good story
- Easy to play
- Really difficult in places
- Really fun if you play with friends

Cons:
- Personally it has no replay value for me whatsoever
- Too many characters
- Level grinding is a pain

Neither a pro nor a con:
- Back. Off. Barbarian. After. 2 Mins."
26739,"must say. the game is fucking awesome even while i played only duo. but if u find more friends then omg unleash the true fun of this game. 
tons of stuff to explore, and when u get a little bored time for some fights betwen players :D which btw are fun.
only downside is the ramdom crashes in multyplayer which there are some guides in the internet to resolve but should still get fixed."
26740,Awesome game. Lots of fun.
26741,orange princess got me acting up ngl
26742,"a fun,action packed, anc cute game, lots of enemies,weps and bosses to enjoy

10/10 i would buy it again"
26743,"Awesome game. 10/10. It will give you tons of hours of fun. Either you play it alone or with friends, this never gets old. You can replay it all the time you want, because there are so many characters that you will want to try them out, besides of all the weapons and all the little flying pets that you have (cant remember how their are called). Buy this game, you want it, I want it, everyone want it. I must say, if you are buying this, make sure a couple of friends get it to so it is more fun that way."
26744,Really fun to play with or without friends.
26745,im bad
26746,nice game i love itttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
26747,hatty hattington is in the game 10/10
26748,"Just an awesome game all around. Solid and challenging gameplay with the artstyle of the Behemoth. Nice DLC characters, and good battles. Also fun multiplayer and local playing support. There's plenty of weapons and playstyles with the level system to not make the game get stale as fast as you might think it will."
26749,"Would definitely waste multiple hours of my life on this game again, E Z. Humor is glorious."
26750,"Wow, talk about an unexpected thrill ride.

Castle Crashers is made by the same group of Devs that created the little known gem called Alien Hominid. If you have ever played that game then you can immediately see the influence it had on their development style.

Castle Crashers is a wonderful co-op experience.. nah.. a co-op player's DREAM COME TRUE. The game's plot is as purposefully basic - you are a knight tasked with subduing evil and saving the princess. Right away you are greeted with a wonderful world of humor, fantastic art and vibrant colors. 

Humor is everywhere in this game and the pacing is perfect. It's refreshing to see a game so wonderful by Devs that clearly had fun and didn't take themselves too seriously.

Do yourself a favor - buy this game right now. 9.5/10."
26751,"This isn't a bad game, singleplayer is fun but way better with friends. And everyone always enjoys a pooping bear, dear, and owl"
26752,I would recommend this game if only I didn't constantly get spammed by arrows 24 fucking 7. Arrow spam is the most cancerous thing I've seen since C4 in CoD.
26753,"Led a platoon of 5 knights against an army of armored jedi knights. We facked them until we had to jump through the roof and land into the wedding cake, all of them missed and hit the floor except me

26757,"I Haven't played the steam version too long, but when I decided to play an online match No one joined or either left.
Some people stayed but couldn't figure it out to select a character. If none of your friends have this game it's ehh fun. Castle  Crashers was fun when I played it on newgrounds back in 2013, But I recommend It and all the modes are fantastic and with friends? oh boy yes please.
 
On your own - great experience

with friends -  even greater experience

                           ~Radish"
26758,A amazing game ive beat the game on console with every character at lvl 99 and beaten the whole game in hardmode with each of them. i have over 2k hours on the console version  the game is worth it and the pc version has better graphics so thats a plus but the controls are a bit iffy
26759,"An awesome game, if you have friends to play with :D"
26760,worst game i have ever played
26761,"it is fun with friends
it is fun without friends
it is fun

10/10"
26762,"This game has been one of my favorites ever since I had back on my xbox 360 and I was going around doing the lvl 256 glitch. This game has so much replayability that it's actually weird. It doesn't feel like it should, because it's the same basic thing every time but with a new character, but for whatever reason, it never fails to give me an amazing time. Maybe it's the fantastic music, the addicting beat em up gameplay, the cool art style, or some other fourth thing, but whatever it is, it's got me coming back to play Castle Crashers again and again."
26763,"Fantastic game to play with friends. I had my eye on it for a while, then the steam summer sale happened and I bought a 4-pack for $11, a bargain for such a fantastic game."
26764,a great mind confusing game. 10/10

26780,"Easy and fun game to play with family, friends, or single player. Lots of fun aspects and some challenges such as boss fights, mob fighting, and pvp. I would recommend this game."
26781,"This game is very interesting, the style is very good, it is good. I have been playing for a day, in short, it is a lot of fun."
26782,The artwork and poop does everything in this game
26783,one of the best co-op games i ever played!
26784,"This game is one of the best game's I've seen in Steam.

11/10 would play again."

26786,damn this game is hard
26787,"Great fun with friends, kinda hard..."
26788,:D
26789,Humorous game. Fun to play.
26790,"Super fun games with friends. You'll enjoy the fighting enemies and the little story that goes along with it. Pretty colorful and the game looks nice, I don't think the art would be outdated if that matters to you. The game is really easy to understand and it's just a really great game to play with friends if you've got some that want to play it with you. As long as you've got at least one other person to play with you'll be good, I think it's 2-4 players."
26791,Gr8
26792,"Loved this game growing up on the xbox360. I just had to get the new version. It is not as good as the ps4 version because there are less dlc packs and it takes forever to get the king character and etc. But since I have beaten the game twice in under one day, it became boring. But this game has many memories that will last. But I kinda regret spending $20 on this game and barely playing it now. I bought the 2 dlc packs and the game. If you have he money to buy it I prefer it. But if you are looking a good game for under $20, this game is not for you. Idk how to rate this game, so I'm just going to put yes. 😄"

26799,"The game is just 'meh'. The gameplay is pretty limited, and it doesn't have the first 'wow' you would want to have when first launching your game.. Even though many games do not these days."
26800,Great co-op 10/10
26801,Good
26802,Brutally unforgiven AI
26803,good game!!
26804,"Fun retro-styled beat-em-up with a good mix of humour.
Very casual and great for short gaming sessions.
If you miss couch co-op games, I highly recommend picking this up for consoles instead.
Gameplay is simple and it is unusually satisfying to juggle enemies, moreso with friends.
Plenty of unlockables to ensure high replayability.

Rating: 8/10"
26805,"very fun, specially with some friends"
26806,imagine having enough friends to play this as intended
26807,Castle Crashers is a great game for Friends and others. I recommend this game to anyone if they love stratagy and skillful games!
26808,Loved the multiplayer mode in the game so much. Even better that once you beat it the first time you're able to go through it again to play at a harder intensity.
26809,"realy fun, specialy with friends"

26817,fun. nuff said
26818,"Castle Crashers is a fun non stop action 2d style beat-em up type of game, you can play the game with up to four friends(its more fun with friends) or by yourself.

So I would say this a very funny game and you should play it."
26819,GREATE GAME !
26820,best game for me :V
26821,This Game Are Best
26822,A very fun game of beating a helpless 1 guy to death in the air non stop for a few minutes
26823,"Beat the final boss 4 hours in. This is excluding insane mode. I only died twice.
To be fair though, I also beat this numerous times on the PS3 back in middle school. So I still heavily recommend it. Very great game."

I normally play this with at least two other people at a time and think that it is a very fun game to play with your friends. If your friends do not plan on getting this then I would not recommend, but if they are you definitely should too."

- Nobody play online

5/7 would recomend"
26841,"What a great game. This game should be the benchmark for every co-op couch game.

If you want an accessible (but challenging!) and ridiculously fun game with great combat then pick this up.

The only downside I can think of is that sometimes the screen gets filled with so many things happening at the same time that it becomes confusing but it's not unplayable by any means.

9/10"
26842,"Gameplay is pretty fun (specially with friends) and it's also pretty diverse!
_
story...well these kind of games don't need a very complicated story ... ""just go save our princesses"" will do just fine!
_
graphics are cool , very colorful , no bug (!) , wont make my eyes tired ...(didnt expect more from a indie game)
_
musics are absolutly awesome imo , specially when you're in the map or near the blacksmith (some super funny musics)

so... yeah... go get it... trust me you wont regret it :)"

26850,this game is amazing so awsomm go castle crashers
26851,This is a great game!!!!
26852,Fun with friends
26853,"Castle Crashers, a lovely little beat-'em-up that understands that soft spot in gamers' hearts for air-juggling four enemies simultaneously with awesomely extensive air combos and knocking them all back a screen and a half. 

Yup, this game is 98.5% sterling fun, designed simply to put a smile on your face without even attempting to take itself seriously. The controls are responsive (though I've accidentally used an item more than once), the art style charming, and that sense of humor and heart that categorizes the best of indie gaming are on full display.

Yes, yes, there is that 1.5% that annoys me - some parts of the game are a nightmare to play solo, the first phase of the Necromancer boss comes to mind. The nadir of the whole game for me was that accursed volleyball section, but I had the fortune of playing as Orange Knight, so I just kept the ball up and my opponents alight with my Y magic like the good sport I was. Also, while the sort-of 2.5D perspective reminiscent of games like Turtles in Time is pretty cool, it sometimes makes it hard to hit anything due to your attacks being on a 2D plane.

That aside, though, this game was a blast - now I just need to get 3 friends to play with."
26854,Very good game with friends.
26855,its fun fighting game and diffrent wepons
26856,fun game to play with friends
26857,Fucking waste of money and this guy name kyle a fucking try hard

26859,"Let me tell you my story.
This game is my absolute favorite game.
I started playing this game with my friends on the PS3. I was very behind. To this day, I still am. But I had a darn good time. 
I got this game on Steam just a week ago. I got the DLC later on and for once, I felt good at the game. (But I'm still stuck on volleyball. Screw you, volleyball.) My friends proceeded to get it and we all make a great team.
That is my story of Castle Crashers. Excellently fun and hard, 9001/10. Brings people together."
26860,I only have 20 hours on this game but man this game is fun. its just so much bullshit and it is so much fun with friends too.

It's a great game for a local get together party if you wanna have some fun with a group. Solo it's fun, but it's just not as amusing. I'd give it an 8/10"
26872,loved it

-doesn't need humour to be fun

top tier"
26877,"Fun with friends, fun without.
9/10.
Gamepad reccomended."
26878,"If I may be honest, this game is one that hooks you and never lets go. It's almost as addicting as Undertale, but (sadly to say) it does not have a lot of players. Go share this with your friends and this game can be great multiplayer! Right now that bit doesn't like to work for me atleast... but hey this is still an amazing game."

26880,just please get the game
26881,Best multiplayer 2D hack and slash ever made.
26882,Best game forever :)
26883,"Very excellent choice for a game! If you're into non-stop button mashing, then it should just be perfect for you!"
26884,"this game is very addictive, play for hours without realising so i would say its worth every penny."
26885,best gaem evr
26886,Absolutely LOVE the game. This is by far one of my favorite games i played it a lot before on the ps4 and when i saw it was on steam i just had to buy it. Really recommend it.
26887,"good game, fun maybe.
"
26888,"even without my childhood memory googles, this game is still as awsome as i rememberd.
it is hilariously fun whith 3 or 4 peapol intense at 2 and still realy fun alone, whith 31 characters to unlock, i dont know how much levels, and fast action 2D beat'em'up gameplay. you bet it is fun as hell. there are also little jokes a bit evrywhere in the game wich is always a nice touch"
26889,This game is awesome
26890,"let the button mashing  festivities begin !

great co-op party game. even over the internet."
26891,It's a very aswome co-op game!
26892,"You get a giant frog with the blacksmith dlc, why shouldn't you get this game?"
26893,fun
26894,"This game, while being easy, is extremely fun to play. I enjoy it greatly its a nice game to fall back on after playing so many shooters. It is also a ""casual"" game which may not seem appealing but its nice to be able to play though a game in a single day. Plus it has insane modes which is really fun."
26895,BEST GAME EVER!
26896,"I recommend this game to people who understand that you have to try again sometimes. It's fun has a lot of great humor and overall amazing to play. Finding secret characters is so satisfing. Getting new weapons and pets are cool especially when the pets and weapons look like differents things, like the blacksmith's horns and the install ball. This game is a real treat."
26897,Best game ever! I love the easter eag If you can the other game. I got this one and my reaction was just this: *jawdrop* ... YES!!!
26898,"Yes. Yes. Just yes. This is easily one of my favourite games of all time. An extremely fun and challenging beat 'em up with a unique, fun and well designed cartoon environment. Great bosses, fun combat and fantastic to play with friends. In works on almost all systems and is double better with a controller. I can only recommend this so much. Simply 10/10"
26899,"stuff u need to innore
"
26900,Super Awesome
26901,GG
26902,Heh.  Poop joke.
26903,"Great Game to play if ur bored. Even better if played with friends. However, should have added more plot."
26904,"Castle Crashers is one of those games where it takes old ideas and makes them new. It takes inspiration from games like The Simpsons Arcade game, fantasy games and more. Whatever way Behemoth made this, they without a doubt did their homework. Apart from minor annoyinces with the CPU enemys, Castle Crashers is a game that every Steam owner should have. Also, try it with 4 player co-op!"
26905,This is good. i lick it.
26906,"this game is cheap, and funny, fun to play with friends"
26907,"WOW! 44 Mins and I can say that it worth it, it's better if you buy the bundle with this one and Battleblock Theatre, I do recommend it, even I'm thinking to buy one for gift .. because it's better with a friend.

Level up option, Arena, Items... everything it's good and it's not boring :P!

Buy it :D1"
26908,is gud
26909,"Really loved the game its fun to play with friends and enjoyable to me I think more people should play this game because of the creativity and hard work for this game to be popular I would say that anyone would enjoy it, great game."
26910,Good game to play with friends!
26911,"I honestly can't recommend Castle Crashers enough. It's a stellar platformer with unique mechanics and its own brand of quirkiness that it pulls off really, really well. The cutscenes are hilarious, and the platformer mechanics just work really, really well. :)"
26912,Fantastic game to play with friends. A little short but it keeps your attention.
26913,"10/10 will fap to Last Princess All day.

Jokes aside.

Pros:
Multiplayer (Controller support within the same multiplayer room itself)
Cartoonish Art style?
Relatively repitive and fun gameplay i surpose...

Cons:
Crappy Latency through multiplayer(expect Endless Paradox to happen)
Short Gameplay(Takes less then 5hours or so to complete it.)
Boring when played long"
26914,"best 2d scroller game

would 10/10 save princess again"
26915,Fun Fun Fun.
26916,"Such a great beat'em up game. My first game on Steam and this really was worth the $15 paid (I know, I'm an idiot for not buying during 'SALES'). Extremely recommended, especially since the HD update a while back has made the experience more breathtaking!"
26917,"I bought this game last year summer sale, and damn. played a lot with my pals when i don't get internet connection, usually at school we play as 4 in break time.

never feel so bad betraying friends just for a kiss

10/10"
26918,fun and quirky... get it
26919,Loved this game it was so cool and i recommend people play this if they ever make another game exactly like this i would buy it so fast you wont even believe it
26920,"It's a fun game overall, especially with friends"
26921,"I like the game alot, it is a beat up type of game and I dont like these type of games but castle crashers make that gameplay fun, the only thing that is wrong with this game is that i would like to play more of the DLCs' but overall this game is good."
26922,10/10 very addicting
26923,Good me like
26924,100% erect
26925,"I fucking love that game!
Played 2-3 times already"
26926,"Very fun game! I think it's funny and an awesome game I love how you first ahve 4 main characters and as you go down the road, you can unlock more characters so you don't get bored! Lets say you've unlocked all characters and beat the game, probably gets boring but then they have insane mode! Insane mode is great, it's super difficult and if you tihnk you're up for the challenge, then go for it!

Overall great game and I reccomend you buy this game, even right now since there is a Summer Sale! $3.00 is all it is for hours on end fun!"
26927,fun
26928,Its Perfect
26929,"A masterpiece from the developer: The Behemoth

The game is very exciting both in its plot and gameplay.

When playing, choose an orange knight, his Princess is the funniest, and is one of the cherries of this game.

Playing alone is pretty boring.So you need to definitely do it with your friends, then the game will become much funnier and more interesting!"
26930,"It has a very funny and refreshing gameplay to it.
I suggest to play it in multiplayer!!!"
26931,''Best game of the year.''
26932,When I played this on the 360 when i was a kid I enjoyed everybit of it . :D
26933,"It's a very good and fun game
"
26934,meh?
26935,"This game is challenging and fun, where you can fucking chop someones head off, throw a king of his own castle, ride the fucking CUTEST fucking horse, collect lots of different and awesome animal orbs, listen to one of the best soundtracks, do some crazy-ass combos and level-up more than 15 characters with different abilities. 
One of the most fun games to play with friends.
10/10"
26936,"Honest opinion on Castle Crashers?

Buy it for the minigames.

Look, I'm just an average Joe, getting my parents to pay my bills one day at a time. So yes, I enjoy a good castle crashing session every once in a while, and yes, I occasionally get up at 3 in the morning, drawn to the inexplicable, sexy allure of the alien hominid, (oh yeah, shoot those lasers, you seductive grenade wielding bugman.) But once you play through the game 7 or 8 times, you've played through it all the times. Okay, 9 times. 10 times. I'm done, I promise. 

...

Shit I played it again. Okay, once you've played through it ELEVEN times and no more, it gets old. But you know what never gets old? Screaming like a parakeet being murdered as I slam my face into the keyboard trying to produce some kind of desireable outcome on Back Off Barbarian, or pressing the right click button over and over (or Y, for you controller  using weirdos) in order to prevent your best friend from ever getting up, and in the process losing that person as your best friend. (You don't really know someone until you duel them in Castle Crashers.) Or seeing the alien hominid glow yellow and release that sweet, succulent ball of pure... unadulterated... doom... 

Um.

Kinda...

kinda lost my train of thought there...

7/11 PLAY THIS GAME IT'S THE ONLY TIME I'VE EVER ACTUALLY HAD FUN WHILE USING STEAM
"
26937,A very fun beat 'em up!
26938,"One of the best beat em up games ever known
pros;
Amazing combat system
decent cartoony Characters
Humor
Really fun to play with friends
Not bad to play alone
funny adventure
satisfying sounds
has an insane mode for hardcore players
leaderboards to beat in online mode
If you have friends most of the cons i have stated are nothing for you to worry about

cons:
Not many people on multiplayer
Constantly reminds you the you lack friends 
Constatly reminds you that you have no girlfriend
The enemies can be dicks in the casual mode i can't get a hit off this fucker and im still trying
The skill trees are not very good in fact the game starts reducing the amount of skill points once you are above a certain level its terrible.
the bosses can be hard sometimes because you forget you can use a shield
i have been trying to hit this asshole for weeks and i still have got a nick of him just a tap is fine just GIMME A HIT AND STOP THROWING ME!!!!!!!!!!"
26939,Game is OP
26940,"This game is so fun when playing with friends. When you have savage friends, hilarious."
26941,"All in all, this might be the best deal on the Steam Summer Sale this year (2016). Just bought this game for my daughter and I to couch co-op (she's 6) last week for $15!!! Argh!!! ""Dad, this is my new favorite game! It's even better than Gang Beasts!"""
26942,Great game. Better with friends.
26943,Castle crashers is good but it randomly lags until someone leaves our group
26944,"I remember when I was around 7 years old (about 7 years ago) my brother bought this game on Xbox, we played this together all the time along with one or two of his friends and had an amazing time. I've spent countless hours replaying the missions just leveling up characters as much as I can, and flipping out while trying to beat insane mode. I seriously reccommend this game for anyone who likes to play genuinely super fun games with friends (very fun alone too). It has, and always will be, one of my favorite games of all time. I can't wait to waste those hours all over again with my steam friends."
26945,Great game 8/10 ign
26946,this game is AWESOME! only I wish that the single player wasnt hiding in the local game and depth perseption is a bish but other than that its great.
26947,"BOI DO I LOVE KILLING WAVES AND WAVES OF EVERYONE! ;)
"
26948,Amazing!!
26949,"Best arcade game on xbox, best on PC too"
26950,Love this game. Play it with my fwiends
26951,I Can't Buy Things Like Health Potions Or Switch Weapons ... I Have Enough Money And It Won't Buy Even Though I'm Pressing The R Key
26952,"Funny, Fun, & Fantastic!
A great game to play with friends, or alone. Love the many different characters & enemies. Cute graphics, but dont be fooled, its extremely fun. Beat up your enenmies with your fists, magic, arrow, bombs, or just have fun being beefy! The grind is real for gold and points for stat points, and of couse the many secrets of hidden weapons & animals."
26953,its alright
26954,"A great game that give you the posibility to play with your friends.

10/10"
26955,"Great game with friends. Recommended with a call or steam chat, because no chat system implemented. Gotta go back and forth for the map.

Multiplayer arena matches though. 8.5/10"
26956,This game is lots of fun especially with friends! A must try ;)

26959,my favorite of the Behemoth library of games
26960,Great fun with friends! And there's an Insande Mode and tons of characters for replay value.
26961,"castle crashers is amazing it's a steal for 2.99 until july 4 2016.castle crashers has a great level cap nice RPG elements ,awsome boss fights ,10 hour story (wich feels like 3),cute artstyle and great fun with freinds.this game isn't perfect with the cliche story no skill tree and boring  (for me) arena modes which the prizes don't pay off.although this is an RPG there isn't much replayability if you don't play w/ freinds next to you.
"
26962,cute and fun!
26963,entertainment 9/10
26964,really awesome to play with friends
26965,It's a cool and good even if you play alone but better playing with friends.
26966,"Me: *Playing Castle Crashers*
Mom:*Watches me play* ""That game is so cute""
Me:*Chops off head*
Mom: ""Ohh""

10/10 Best Beat 'em up"
26967,"I got this with the summer sale and boy is it worth it! I've only played a short time but ever since like 2014 I've always dreamed about owning this game. I first encountered this game through the demo on my PS3, and instantly I knew that I wanted it. The only downside at the time was I was too young to have any debit/credit card and my parents didn't like buying new games. So now that the steam summer was is here, I got the game and am immensely enjoying it. It definitely is a classic along with Battleblock Theater so I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND! THUMBS UP"
26968,All around fighting fun.
26969,"I just played this game for an hour and, oh my god, it is amazing! It runs smooth and all you need is a decent computer, not a lot of RAM, and Internet acsess to play wit friends!

I would really recoomend this game to anyone, regardless to what kind of game genre you like. Because, honestly, I think it apeals to all! 

Also! Good idea to buy while the Summer Sale is happening!"
26970,THIS IS SPARTAAAAAAAAAN!
26971,good
26972,"Deers that sh*t


10/10 would sh*t again"
26973,"I played the demo of this game for a good 4 hours so of course I love the full game even more. I enjoy this game pretty much equally as much as Battleblock, which is also a great game. The art style in CC is fun in my opinion and the gameplay is also entertaining and enjoyable. Playing with friends or just online is also fun (though the online can be empty sometimes). 

9/10"
26974,This game is great for a group or party!
26975,"Great to see the devs still updating the game. The Story Mode was amazing and fun, but the mini game where you do an eating contest was simple and not that good. But the new mini game holy shitballs its so good. 
Bringing back the fun in coop gaming and not being an fps. If you want a good time, especially with friends, get this game. Its great."
26976,it's good
26977,newgrounds take on golden axe
26978,highly highly recommend
26979,"Remember the old Simpson's and X-Men arcade games? If so, and you liked them, you're going to have a great time. If you don't remember those games, or never played them, you're still going to have a great time.

The gameplay is well-tuned, with simple controls and varied weapons, and the humor keeps it going the whole time. You don't even need to play with friends to make it fun, but you will definitely have a much better time in multiplayer."
26980,"so this hack and slash game is good for players who dont like complecated games, this game in particular has a simple objective fight through monsters and save all of the princesses, it might be a little hard in some levels or areanas, but another thing about this game is that you dont level up for how many enemies you kill its by how many hits you get in so leveling up is easy in levels where the boss spawns a crap ton of enemies. But aside from all that the best thing i like about castle crashers is how the final boss is layed out, first you have these hard enemies that are not affected by magic so that sucks so you have to rely on physical strength, and after you go trough that there are three bosses to fight as if they where the final bosses royal gaurd, and finaly the final boss with five modes you have to fight and beat.
"
26981,i like the Behemoth's humor
26982,its wery good geme with absolutly perfect humor.....i recomend it for everybody who wants to  have fun alone or with frends.
26983,One ofthe best games of all time 11/10 ign m8
26984,Good
26985,sick bruh
26986,"One of my favourite multiplayer games I've ever played (with friends) 

The only downsides are that you can't find anyone in online multiplayer and you start to lose interest when playing singleplayer

"
26987,"Extremely fun.
How few games can be extremely fun nowadays?
I rest my case."
26988,If You have 3 friends and just love to play games together get this!!!!! Its replay abbility amd shinanagins you can get into are great. My friends and me have played this game endlessly on console and now on PC. Even by yourself it is enjoyable to just play and chill for the night. Now buy this game and crash the castle.
26989,I love the game but are the king pack DLC just for console and that Necro one for console only or are they already part of the game?
26990,me and my friends had fun playing the game
26991,"It's Castle Crashers, nothing more to say."
26992,This is soo fun I love it!
26993,"10/10 good game
you  can fuck whore princesses after slaughtering your friends and save the kingdom"
26994,"It's like Dark Souls,But I don't auctally want to kill my self this time"
26995,An amazing past time with your friends. I would defiently recommend it.
26996,"It's a very nice couch party game.

10/10"
26997,Amazing game to play with friends.
26998,"Castle crashers ahhh... i just love it. me and a friend had a blast playing, there was a mixture of easy and hard levels and it was just amazing. the game has alot of funny moments and even without a friend to play with i would recomend this game. its also fun too look for unlockables as there is quite alot of them.."
26999,"Jogo muito bem feito, que roda em qualquer torradeira sem placa de vídeo (tipo a minha) a pelo menos 30 fps, não exige internet potente pra jogar online e bem...sobre, o jogo mesmo...10/10
- Uma porrada de cavaleiros diferentes
- É difícil zerar sozinho na primeira vez, o que pode incentivar um co-op dos brother
- Humor de bosta (literalmente)
- DLC's tem um preço aceitável, mas que não afetam em absolutamente nada a gameplay (como uma verdadeira DLC deve ser)
- Diversos combos que você pode fazer com personagens e armas diferentes (fora os pets que sempre buffam alguma coisa dos seus atributos)
- Acho que o único ponto negativo é a falta de comunicação com pessoas online, caso decida achar alguém aleatório pra jogar online. Fora isso, continua 10/10
Recomendado pra qualquer um que tenha dinheiro sobrando na carteira ou esteja procurando por um jogo divertido em promoções."
27000,Just get it
27001,"- at first glance looked like it sux
- friend told me to buy it
- i buy it for 15 dollars
- play level one: this is ez

Planning to go through it once again."

No really buy this game

27010,Funny and fun co-op game
27011,"Amazing and fun im going to rack up hours with my friends, i would give it a 10/10 for a fun style and creative game worth the money!!!"
27012,Me and my friend were bored with only 3 dollars to use right and then i remember that me and my brother played a game on the xbox and it was called Castle Crashers and i was looking for the game and i found it and i was surprised because i have a POOPY COMPUTER and it was working fine this game is really fun even with a multiplayer server
27013,i find the most satisfaction in fighting my party member to the death for a kiss and UNLIMITED bragging rights.
27014,It is a fun and easy to play game
27015,"Challenging, upgradable shit and different heroes. Great with friends. Controller recommended."
27016,"Awesome game, played with friends and we enjoyed every minute, we even went back to find all the pets and attempted to unlock all the achievements. That being said not much to do other than play boss fights over again and fight amongst each other. Not many levels. Story line was nice and enjoyed all of the levels. If youre looking for something long, this isnt the game but its a night or three of laughs and enjoyment."
27017,"jump, light attack, rinse and repeat. 
game over."
27018,"(Disregard my steam time; I have this game on xbox and have played through it at least 3 times)

There are only 3 reasons to not own this game.

1.  You don't have however much money it costs (on sale all the time).
2.  You don't have a controler. 
3.  You don't like good games.

Otherwise, there's literally no reasons that you shouldn't buy this."
27019,Love this game. 485761874356815467184/10
27020,dis game gud.
27021,"A rather amusing co-op game where you can tag along with random players on a quest to save princesses.
The only downside I discovered while playing this game is that in order to aqcuire new characters you have to play the same campaign over and over again with a different character each time, which can result in some boredom if you play the same level for the third time with a different character."
27022,A lot of fun for the hole Family
27023,Love this game! Definately one of my fav games of all time! Really recommend this game if you enjoy RPG games like MapleStory
27024,"I Recommend this game because is very funny  to play with friends. The story is so cool and the ""EndGame""is finding all the swords :)"
27025,this game is great whenever there is nothing to do i come to this game. ITS ADDICTING to get skulls on characters. I do r1ecommend this game

27028,"Want to have some fun with your friends? Buy this. 10/10 great co-op game. I don't even like beat 'em ups that much, and this was still great."
27029,"Awesome game, love to play with friends. Multiplayer is fantastic, runs smoothly 99.9% of the time.  Really humorous, as well. Good game to just sit down for a while and play away!"
27030,I love it!!!
27031,ayyyy where's castle crashers 2 at?
27032,"I'm going to look at [i]Castle Crashers[/i] from two points of view: casual and hardcore. Now I'm fully aware that ""casual"" is a dirty word when it comes to videogames. Honestly, I think a game being casual is a good thing. If I'm playing a lot of hardcore games, the kind with a lot of depth, high punishments for failure, and an extreme level of difficulty; I'm going to want something to fall back on. In this regard, [i]Castle Crashers[/i] fits the bill.

However, a lot of games - sometimes the best ones - can appeal to both the casual and hardcore gamers. These titles offer a perfect learning curve and are enjoyable at any skill-level. There are multiple methods for playing through them. The challenge can range from easy to improbable. It all depends on how the player approaches these games. Though it tries, [i]Castle Crashers[/i] can't bridge this gap. It's a fine game for a friendly get-together, or a time-sink on a slow day. If you're looking for a quality brawler, the kind you can keep coming back to again and again, then look elsewhere.

I hate to say it, but this review isn't over yet.

Looking further, [i]Castle Crashers[/i] works as a casual game due to the constant thread of ""niceties"". These are moments that make you say ""Oh. That's nice."" when they happen. Leveling up, the discovery of a new weapon or animal, a dead enemy dropping a valuable crystal instead of a mere coin; these are all examples of niceties. The game is further bolstered by simplistic but charming hack & slash action. Through the combination of both elements, as well as flavor touches like the set-piece battles and action sequences, this game works. It just plain works.

Even with this casual approach, you're still bound to run into problems. The balance between strength, magic, and agility is crap. Magic and agility require huge investments to attain any noticeable effect. Strength is an absolute necessity, unless you want to juggle foes for several minutes at a time. The ranged options are only forced onto the player by the rare appearance of giant enemies. You know who these jerks are, because you can't get close to them, without being grabbed and thrown.

Also, while the niceties are appreciated, I believe that Behemoth could have done a little better. Character-unlocking is just plain awful after a certain point. Having to replay the entire game with character F to unlock character M is maddening. It's especially bad when A) all characters behave the same outside of spells B) every character starts at level 1 and C) there aren't any methods for passing experience onto new characters. Dynasty Warriors is a franchise with gobs of playable heroes, and usually there's some method for strengthening unused characters, so everyone remains at a level playing field. In [i]Castle Crashers[/i], this -admittedly not all that important - element was overlooked, and it's pretty annoying.

The insane mode is ironically where hardcore gamers are liable to get the door slammed in their faces. This is also where the game almost completely falls apart. A high difficulty mode is fine, but it needs to make sense. Insane difficulty features faster and more aggressive enemies, so it's good on that front. Unfortunately, their HP and especially their strength have recieved a massive multiplier, and that's really bad. A number of enemies and bosses go from non-threatening to entirely absurd. For most players, insane mode ends with the large troll of the Thieves' Forest.

This is my third play-through of the game, and I still don't understand why insane mode exists. In the original Xbox 360 version, insane mode was somewhat mitigable, due to a prevalent experience glitch (involving the troll boss). This is one of those rare glitches that actually made the game worse when it was fixed. Depending on how you look at it, abusing an XP glitch to make a game easier probably isn't very hardcore. As far as I'm concerned, insane mode is where the game actively cheats. Everyone has too much HP and does too much damage, but apparently it's unfair for players to have something to fall back on. 

Personally, I would have suggested difficulty modifiers (ala [i]Bastion[/i]) instead of a difficulty mode, but this a 20/20 hindsight suggestion. I certainly didn't have the idea, when [i]Castle Crashers[/i] was released, back in 2008. All told, this game is still pretty enjoyable and even better with friends. Just don't invest too much of your energy, because the pay-off isn't worth the effort."
27033,A simple yet funny time waster. Worth every penny.
27034,"i need halp m8s mah stuvv on castle crashers keeps getting deleted D: sotell meh if u found out how toget ur stuff back.plz :)
"
27035,"Played it for many hours at first on Xbox 360 and some time after, at some sale, started to play it again on PC. I can say for sure that Castle Crashers is one of most interesting beat 'em up games I have ever played. Graphics might look like some kind of game for kind but don't be mistaken - kids, teenagers, adults, everyone will have great time playing this game. With so many characters (few at start, many to unlock) to play, so many levels to make, many weapons and secrets to find, you won't be bored after beating once, or twice, or until you will reach max level with every character. You can enjoy it alone, or with friends on 1 PC or over internet. Castle Crashers isn't not only filled with action, but also with humour, and what's better, the one that will for sure make you laught, unless you take everything too serious. Sure, some people will say it get's boring quickly or it's repetitive but if you ask me, I didn't get bored even once in those 50 (at the moment I'm making this review) hours. And I'm sure I will play it at some point again, and again, and again... and again. It's really easy to get addicted to this game.

In my opinion, it's worth full price but sure, there are people who might not know what Castle Crashers is, or what kind of people made this game. If you are fan of beat 'em up games, then you must grab it at sale. Look at the number of reviews this game have received, and look at what number of those are positives ones - there is high chance that another positive review will be coming from you."
27036,"Rode a dear crap-rocket through a barn to escape the most METAL looking monster I have ever seen. 10/10.

No, but in all seriousness this game is amazing! This is the first game I have seen do the beat 'em up/rpg right. This game also supports local multiplayer if you have the right amount of controllers, yet another amazing feature about it. The level designs are also top notch with the bosses at the end of them definitely befitting each one. I should also point out that the levels flow seemlessly into one another and just feel like one really long level rather than a bunch of really short ones. The characters in this game are cute and quirky. For example, who didn't laugh the first time they saw the anus-faced Archers? Finally, the DLC. The DLC is definitely worth it and produced my two favorite characters from this game. The Blacksmith as a fighter is very fun to play with. The Pink Knight... Well, have you ever wanted to murder things with the power of gay? Now you can! Finally, the bonus modes. Pretty fun to play with friends, but not solo.

This game is crazy fun and will most likely have you laughing your tail off. All and all, I give it a 9.5/10."
27037,"Pelo preço vale a pena

4/10"
27038,"One of my favorite games of all time. Easy to get into, always learning new techniques and magic, and the music is amazing. I find myself humming tunes to myself sometimes. There is AWESOME character cuztimization, and the game is great for its price.

If you like these kinds of games, then trust me, you wont be getting bored of it soon. You will probably be replaying the game over and over, mostly with friends, because it is a great challenge. You are always unlocking something, and it satisfies so much, you feel like you could be playing it for hours, and never be bored."
27039,"Beat 'em ups are back, this game is awsome and i recomend it to everybody who likes a good co-op game or beat 'em up.
(i am Dutch so sorry for typos)"
27040,Entertaining game to play accompanied :D

27055,"Pretty fun game, if anyone is down, i can help people make it past levels"
27056,fun to play with friends and at the same time not so much.
27057,"A simple yet a great game for couch CO-OP , had my shares of LOLS with friends and family members alike. But lacks content you'll easily get bored of stuff to do in the game as it is very arcade like.. [7/10] would recommend this game to all if you just want a quick a short fun for a few hours."
27058,"This game I just played few time, and I gave a simple review. Probably recommand it............"
27059,"amazing rpg adventure
"
27060,"Fun game, alot of hidden gems. If you have 1 or more friends that own this , go ahead and play a Co-op run. Could be frustrating though, some part of the games are really hard.

9/10 good game."
27061,"Howcome you don't have this yet??
11/10"
27062,"Fun simple game that can be a bit addicting really, lol."
27063,One of the best co-op games ive ever played.
27064,"Really fun party game to play with you're friends.
Although dont try playing it all alone, or playing it with just you're keyboard. Make sure you have a compatible controller at hand, cause its really difficult with a keyboard."
27065,Really fun game 10/10
27066,"It is an old game but since i primarily game on a laptop I'm always looking for good games that can run on my system.

Castle Crashers looks really good, play really well. The controls are easy to use both on the keyboard and xbox controller (although i keep accidently using my items from the tiny inventory) so this is great to play with friends with little or no gaming experience. Theres tons of weapons and all the upgradable character abilities are equally important which makes it a challenge to prioritize your skill points. The game is a good balance of difficulty, not too hard or too easy and theres a wide variety of enemies and bosses in an art style i really dig.

 After completing the game the first time round, Castle Crashers still has more to give. The addition of insane mode and secrets all over the map like weapons to dig up and animal orbs in the store makes sure you never get tired of this game. Very worth my money. Get it if you're bored, get it if you have friends coming over, get it if you haven't."
27067,10/10 would kiss the last princess again
27068,Zoom! Ok. This is all I can write. I have nothing nice to say about this game nor anything bad. It is a side scrolling game of dosh simulation. It was fun for an hour and now I am going to play something else.
27069,"Good game. Playing with friends is fun. Nice cartoon graphics. Nice gameplay. 

Overall: 8.3/10"
27070,"A consle game not pc, it 100% requires a controller"
27071,love it
27072,"Enjoyable and accessible beat-em-up with a fun, cartoonish aesthetic.  It's not a particularly deep game, but it's great for couch or online co-op.  Recommended for gaming couples!"
27073,"Fantastic game, play it whenever I wanna kill time and have a laugh. The art style is light and fun, but the combat is dynamic and entertaining(for a 2D game). Plus, shooting lighting from yourhands is always a plus in my book."
27074,"this game is the funniest game there is (to me,i don't know about you) it is so fun because its just a beat em up game.
you can choose characters and each character has their unique abilities and you can choose what you like.
you can unlock characters by beating the game with a certain character and beating bosses with specific characters.
this game is casual and competitive for fighting enemies with no effort and fighting friends at arenas or fighting to the death for a kiss from a princess.
what also makes this game funny is that there's some references that some will catch.
you should totally buy this game"
27075,This game was completely amazing...10/10 Loved every bit of it. :ccknight:
27076,"Wish I have friends to play this, best couch Co op I have played in recent memory"
27077,aight so basically there are some guys and you kill them so that you can go to the next level and kill more guys and get a new sword. It's pretty epic with friends but if you try to play through the campaign in single player then you're gonna be in for a huge ass whooping.
27078,this game so fun and funny
27079,"Game is Fun, Replayable and very good for people who wants to have a good time with friends, as it has cooperative mode online to play with friends or strangers. 
It has that feeling of playing old games when Arcade was everywhere. All in all, it´s a very fun game."
27080,i very good pass time. recomended
27081,"the game is fun when with friends, and has some fun characters as well. for a pc game, it supports both couch co-op and online.

Take the advice the game gives and use a controller because I have not been able to figure out a keyboard layout that feels natural."
27082,I reccomend this game to everyone! it is so much fun trying to beat the game with every character and how every character has a really cool magical ability my favourite is the necromancer (I also have this on xbox) the dlc is pretty good to if you want dlc i recommend the blacksmith. this is an awesome game with hours of fun for you to enjoy with some odd jokes tied into the game!
27083,Absolutely the best party/couch co-op game ever!
27084,good
27085,This is a really good game it's also a fun game to play with friends.
27086,4
27087,"It Now runs at 60FPS....

9/10 too many hours of my life 
thrown into this game."

okay cool sure i'm down yeah"
27089,"Single player and playing with friends is amazing, but multiplayer with anyone kinda sucks. The game adapts to the slowest link in terms of internet connection. Meaning if someone has a ping of 1,000, everyone has a ping of 1,000 even if you're sitting at a nice 50-100 normally."
27090,Epic. Buy it
27091,a controller is pretty much needed
27092,"A game that fits all players no matter what age range they are. You will be attracted by it no matter you are professional or just want to have a quick play. One of the best and traditional hard core RPG action game. The only problem is you may feel boring if you play it yourself, so...invite your friend :)"
27093,"As someone who is relativley new to gaming still, I've found that castle crashers has helped me with motion control and attack combos (as I really just button mashed at first) . I greatly enjoy the sense of comedic animation it has brought with its art and design, unlocking characters, pets, and weapons makes the playing field much more enjoyable with its variety. I'm not very far along in my gameplay and I am very eager to keep playing. 10/10 would recommend."
27094,"Castle Crashers is a very fun game.  Cool weapons, spells, and abilities.  Lots of fun singleplayer and multiplayer.  Nice visuals and attractive audio.  Castle Crashers offers nice progression and great replayability.  Thank you to my friend who gifted me this fun game. 10/10"
27095,"This game is great! One of the best I've ever played. It's really funny, and it made me laugh a LOT! You should definatly get it."

27097,"
10/10"
27098,"I love this game because it is so fun to play with friends, the boss fights are fun, and it is just overall a very good game. Some parts I didn't like about the game are the volleyball part, (if you know what I'm talking about), how in co-op 2 people can't have the same pet, and kid of how the theives overuse the bow. Some things that I like about it are the vast array of weapons, vast array of animal orbs, playing in the arena with your friends and just random people. I hope that this review helped someone choose to get it, and overall I rate this game 8/10"
27099,The best cartoon game ever played :)
27100,You're in for a real surprise if you fantasised about saving the orange princess...
27101,"Knights. Blue, green, red and orange. Chose wisely. Ha, just kidding. They all kick ass!
This game is derp as hell, and it’s really fun! You have a pretty straight forward story, that normally would have been boring, but is really fun. The enemies are fun and variated, but only in Customization. They all feel very alike. Although, the bosses are variated. 
The weapons are also very fun, and varied. Some of them make you rethink your playstyle, but nothing to major. 
The pets are derp as fuck. They are very different, but some of them are just in the game, to be trolls. And that’s another reason this game is so fun.
The game is best enjoyed with a controller. It can be played with a keyboard, but it’s really hard to play with. It’s also best enjoyed with friends, but can be played alone to. I can’t defeat the final level alone, but everything else is doable.

All in all, if you have a controller, and some friends, go get this game. Solid 8/10.
If you are alone, think about it, before you buy it. If you are playing alone, 7/10"
27102,"Castle Crashers is a fun game about generally crashing castles.
this game is good for people who love:
-war games
-strategy
- and crashing castles
with colourful graphics, destruction, bossbattles and crashing castles
YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME!!!"
27103,"This is one of the best 4-player games available for steam. I don't recomend it if you would play alone, but it is very fun and exciting to play with some friends"
27104,POOPIE DEER
27105,One of the wierdest and most fun fps games ever! Some people call it hat simulator and I can see why there are tons of hats from strange hats to unusual hats this game is all about hats!
27106,"Got this game today,played this game today,best game played ever. 10/10 would cut buttfaced theives head off again
"
27107,"The game s*cks without a controller. Honestly I think this game is best only for Xbox and PS. The game is basically the Internet in a nutshell. Lots of cats, funny faces, lot of poop and some other stuff.
The online gameplay is unbalanced. You can choose servers, you can only find games. And so, without filters or automatic filters, you, a lvl 1 player will be put in a team with 3 lvl 40 players.
At the end of each map, there will be a pvp battle between the team members to win a princess. And as I said, as a lvl 1 player, you have no god damn chance agains 3 other lvl 40 players. You can hit them for 15 minutes and they won't die. But they will hit you once and you're out of the fight.
The game is buggy. Me and my friend were once playing together and at some point, the game messed up and we were put into 2 different maps with a Bot replacing the other one in each one's game.
When you're choosing your map, there is no admin, king player, top player or voting. Everyone can choose which map to go to. Which means 4 players will spam their buttons to get to the map they want. Which never ends well.

I give it 2/10 and do not recommend it at all."
27108,"Hit stuff with friends, then hit friends with stuff."
27109,"Insanity, INSANITY"
27110,mt daera gente
27111,"Castle Crashers is fun alone, but logarithmically so with each friend you add. It's a beat-em-up created by the people who created Alien Homonid, with a similar art style and tone. Each character has different abilities, you can build your characters stats as you choose, and there's decent replay value."
27112,"I completed this game on like 7 hours, I bougt it on a sale and I think is fair. This game is an arcade that is beat them all, is funny, but in some cases it gets monotonus because this mecanic (beating) is funny but for so many hours It gets monotonous. In game Music is nice, graphics are nice, It's very optimized, I recomend it definitely."
27113,Really fun game in both single player and multiplayer and has a whole lot of replayability with tons of characters to unlock.
27114,Amazing local multiplayer game.
27115,"This is an amazing game, one of my favorites, but i think the controlls could have been different, they took time getting used to, but it is still a great game"
27116,ok
27117,"Great game if you're friends don't have bad tempers and can accept the bitterness of defeat.

10/10 would use a keyboard again."
27118,It's pretty good.
27119,Decent Cartoony local co-op player.
27120,"I havent spent alot of time with this game here on the PC, but OHH BOY!
ON THE X-BOX 360, DAM!
I have spent countless hours on there, so recommend that you get a controller if you dont have one and want this game.
Mostly becouse the keyboard controls are SHIT, they WILL give you cancer."
27121,"its just really fun to play
"
27122,A great game.  Perfect for new players or old fans.
27123,Fun solo or multiplayer
27124,"A great game that deserves a sequel and a native Linux port
A funny mindless beat'em up that is addicting because it involves leveling up and character progression and a lot to unlock.

** Its actually playable on LINUX using WINE (Ubuntu 14.04 + Mint 17.3) **"
27125,"spent whole nights playing this game with friends.
good alone 
great with friends"
27126,"Before I start let me just say that I did not have high expectations for this game. This fact makes it very easy for me to say that this game definetely surpassed my expectations by far!!! Some people may be turned away by this game's cartoony and colorful graphics but please, don't let this stir you. This game is addicting to say the least. The game may be quite simple but it's still a lot of fun. I've had a lot of enjoyment just playing by myself but that's not all this game offers. The game features  4-player co-operative play either locally or online. That's right, this PC game has local co-op. If you have a couple of controllers lying around you can play this game with up to 3 friends right in the same room. This can make for some very fun times with your friends or whoever you want. The final verdict is that this game may be quite simple but it's colorful graphics and fun addicting gameplay make for a very great experience to have."
27127,Best Game 11 out of 10.
27128,"buy this game, after recommended by my friend.

its fun, funny, good dificulty, silly, and is extreamly smooth, the soundtrack is nice and the bosses are fun

27155,This is a nice game if you want a 5+ hours of a nice story and game mechanics. I recommend that you play with your friends to complete the game as it makes it so much better and enjoyable.
27156,"It's good, if your bored buy it."
27157,hi
27158,Had the original game in XBLA. Was great. Online multiplayer is unplayable in the Steam release. Freezes and lags constantly.

27166,"Game is very good, played it back when it was first released on xbox360 days, and also, it runs very well with no lag, don't know why people with the negative reviews are complaining, but the online multiplayer does take a while to connect with someone, and even when it does, it cuts out, probably internet connection, but do play with a controller instead of using a keyboard for castle crashers. Also there are some bugs to the game, but it's barely noticable to see it anyways.
Ps- This is my very first review to do."
27167,I Love this game i give it 10/10 it is AWESOME and if i could rate the age i wold rate 6 it is awesome though and i think Behemoth did a great job on this game and Behemoth does AWESOME gmes so to this game i just have to say well done
27168,"A nice beat'em up. It's awfully good to let out frustration.
However careful, because the NG+ is also awfully good to make you frustrated."
27169,Loved this game on xbox 360 and the steam version does not disappoint. Once you get past the 2-D fight style you will recognize what a gem this game is to play.
27170,"The dark souls of cartoons!

Long story short, fun game, but wouldn't pay full price.  It does install in like 30 seconds though, which is pretty cool."
27171,"The intro background music has stuck in my mind.
10/10 would listen to it again."
27172,"It is so satisfying to combo your enemies in this game. It's best played in multiplayer, so get some of your friends and kick some butt!"
27173,"The combat: spam made good.
The story: funny.
The game: castle crashers.
Catch of the Day: Desert Minnow."
27174,It's ridiculously fun! From the gameplay alone with the environment in the game you have tons of hours of bashing through enemies with an array of weapons. Play with friends to multiply the fun!
27175,"AMAZING

Would Kill My Friend Over A Princess again"
27176,"Castle Crashers is a great sidescrolling beat em up with top notch, hand crafted visuals and hilarious bosses and gameplay. Tons of pop culture references, ridiculous weapons and lots of multiplayer options as well as a decently lengthy campaign make this a great beat-em-up to play by yourself or with friends."

27197,"So Many Hours of Replayability, especially with the many many many characters to choose from."
27198,"This game is amazing, it really can entertain for hours and hours of fun, and together with friends, we agreed that we appreciated the second part of this great game.
It would be a real shame not to continue in this simple but awesome game.
Not only I, but perhaps hundreds of thousands of people would like to see the continuation
... Thanks so much for this super game.

I hope there will be as soon as Castle Crashers 2
"
27199,My best friend said to me that I had to play this game. So I did and I don't think that I had made a best choice. This is just an awesome game to play with friends or alone if you don't have internet or friends.
27200,"This game was my childhood, I played it to a pulp and now that its on steam, I can play it as long as an another orange"
27201,"Bought the game on sale, refunded it and bought it again when it went off sale to give the owners the full price, 10/10"
27202,"this in an amazing game!!!!
i recommend it to any one that has a few exstra dollers to spare
buy it!!!!!"
27203,"y'know, if there's one dev i've come to count on for hilarious co-op games, it's the behemoth. and thier first outing after Alien Hominid was a huge hit on XBox Live Arcade. sort of like that 'must have game', but if it were an actual must-have.

the Steam version is still rock solid, pure co-op beat-em-up bliss, with RPG progression unlocking combos, and magic that feels sweet as hell to use. and when it comes time for that final kiss, be prepared to be amazed.

my only complaint is that unless you grind a wee bit, you might find some sections a bit tough. but it's not too terribly bad with the grind.

Oh, and do beat up your friends. that's what friends do when arguing, right?

in short, Castle Crashers stands the test of time. pick it up for a good brawl and a fun time."
27204,"Castle Crashers is a beat 'em up with a charming art style, simple controls, and it is quite fun...the first time playing through it. The game will get extremely repetitive after a while, and some of the bosses are ridiculously repetitive. Despite all that, the game is still fun and if you can get some friends to play with, then by all means, go for it. I'd recommend waiting for it go on sale though.

P.S. My main gripe with the game is that all the characters are more or less exactly the same when it comes to basic attacks, and the only thing that makes a character unique is their magical capabilities....unfortunately, the magic skills are also more or less all the same, with a few minor exceptions."
27205,terrible
27206,Had a blast playing with friends.
27207,love thi s game so much
27208,HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHHHHAA

27218,Much Crashers. Such Wow.

27220,"fun

27221,NEED MORE
27222,"This game has been out for quite some time but Im writing this review just 'CAUSE... great reference. Anyway to start off the combat is really good with different magic on each character (though some are the same as others to some extent) and cool combos you learn as you lv. up is tons of fun. Along with that the many weapons and pets you can find you can have a magic pet that increase magic atk or a pet that spits fire while you have a ice sword to freeze things, and some of these weapons and pets are hidden very well. The story is a funny little tale of knights who go on a quest to retrieve this crystal and stolen princesses while simultaneously killing each other for the princesses affection. And that last princess that gets saved is the best one of them all Den/Den would save again. To wrap it up before this gets too long bosses are done well, theres a hardcore mode that if you wanna suffer like in dark souls its perfect for you, multiplayer is excellent especially when fighting each other, and if you have friends to play with even more fun. I completely recommend this game its a 10/10 your guarenteed to have fun in this and when its on sale its around $1.50 so theres no excuse for you not to buy it than."
27223,good game...
27224,"If you arent already absolutely sick of side scrollers, then this game is absolutely worth your time. 
Completed this game on console, tried it on the PC, Equally good on both! 

The RPG elements of the game will really appeal to you if that is your usual style of play, the crazy cartoon world that Behemoth have created is very pleasing to the eye and the specific niche of humour they bring to the game makes it very enjoyable to play and the fact it doesnt take itself too seriously is refreshing.

Great to play with your mates, start to finish its always changing so keeps it fun. Satisfyingly you get oppurtunities to crush your friends in combat so if you buy it first you can thrash them in these small arena battles, very fun. 

Overall 9/10"
27225,Castle crashers is a awesome game you should try
27226,Good
27227,"The first ever game I got on steam, very fun, addictive and exciting.....did I mention fun. I got this game to play with my bother, but after I played it the first time, I couldn't stop, I played until I complete Hardcore, (the hardest difficulty.

Ahhhh, brings back old memories.

9/10: AWESOME GAME!!!"
27228,"Low price, Very funny with friends and great history 
It's a good game to spend time with friends.
Buy and enjoy this ART !"
27229,"Absolutely amazing game. It has great gameplay with some amount of crude humor causing a overall more casual atmosphere, perfect for a couch co-op session. Some have called the combat repetitive and stale, but in my opinion, with great co-op games becoming rarer and rarer to find, sometimes a simple hack n' slash with some friends is really all you need. The game can get tedious in a journey to grind to 99 and obtaining all collectables, but coming back to the game every once in a while allows the enjoyment of this magnificent title to be stretched out as long as possible. One of the best co-op games out there.

sidenote. Friends not included."
27230,"Very tricky with keyboard and mouse, don't bother unless you have a controller.

Gameplay is satisfying and enemies and environments are varied and fun. Only nuisance is that many elements aren't well communicated so you have to look them up yourself. For example weapons influence your strength, magic, defence and agility stats but the symbol for magic wasn't clear to me so for the first several hours I thought a weapon that boosts magic was increasing my combo damage or melee weapon range or something. Also you pick up animal companions and you don't know what they do until you leave the level and take a visit to your menagerie. 

Play with friends. Ok single player but way more interesting with a buddy."
27231,LIKE A BOSS
27232,good
27233,Awesomely addictive.
27234,best game
27235,i laughd a lil bit when the deer poopood
27236,"amazing game overall but only fun with two people
"
27237,I do recommend this game because it is fun to play with friends and is one of the best party games. I recommend to play with others because it get's kind of boring with yourself.
27238,"This game is good.
The gameplay is good and the graphic is good for this game. This game is better with your friends becase it is funny and you can fun. Not short game so you can play a lot with this game.
And you can get trading cards."
27239,"What to do in Castle Crashers...
1.Buy the game
2.Play the game
3.Eat sandwiches with steroids and hallucenents
4.Die

27240,great!
27241,"One of the best beat 'em up game I've ever played. It plays masterfully, the enemies are varied and interesting, and the soundtrack was pretty kick ass as well."

27244,This game is fun. even more fun when you troll your friends.
27245,Fun game with comedy and fast gameplay. 10/10 I love to play with with my friends.
27246,"One of the most fun games on Steam, I'd highly recommend it. Though playing alone can get kind of boring."
27247,"If played alone it's (only) a decent game, but it's one of the best coop game I've played."
27248,"it's hard to play, so i just spam ""w"" like i'm having a stroke

[h1] GET THE FUCKING GAME [/h1]

oh, and use a controller if you have one."

27250,Why are you reading reviews? Just download the demo or buy it NOW
27251,"My kind Souled friend gifted this to me , I thank him, he recommended this to me , and  I agree."
27252,"Can't even open the game because of a bug thank goodness I got this as a gift

EDIT: Played at a friends house, was quite fun. Too bad I can't open it on my computer but it playing it at my friends house was too fun to give it a bad review. 

10/10 Would be trapped on a alien ship while my friend took the only escape pod"
27253,Great game it puts in a great challenge.
27254,this game was a dorky and cute game when i had it on xbox 360 (first game ) so i had to buy it its a great game to relax and have fun with and the story is cute
27255,"Mindless tower smashing, palace crushing, building breaking, among others. Better with friends though."

27259,"
This is the best game. I have it on xbox and on PS3 as well. It is hours of fun and if you play it with other people it rocks!"
27260,"A port of the XBLA original, Castle Crashers will take you across a hand-drawn journey with four other players on your side. Beat up hoards of baddies and fight for the princess's kiss. The music was created by the Newgrounds community and gives the game a distinct touch. A crazy amount of unlockable characters are ready to be found, leading to countless hours of content to help grind up your knight."
27261,"This game is a great hack and slash side-scroller with a great comedic tale to go with the gameplay. This game can be hosted on a single computer to maxmized the fun with 4 players. This game is great because you can with all ages! Seriously, I played with my little sister and we both laughed so hard we fell out of chairs while playing."
27262,"An old game, but still a goodie. A genuinely silly beat-em-up with a Newgrounds flash game-esque feel? Yes please.

My only real complaint would be enemies in the latter half of the game being rather bulky making first runs in later levels be rather tedious. ..that and for the most part investing into magic is objectively better than investing into any other stat. 
The Back Off Barbarian side-game isn't a favorite of mine at all, but I'd imagine folks will have fun with it. If you're playing the Xbox 360/Playstation 3 versions, expect a completely different side-game to take this one's place. Maybe some different stats for various weapons/animals as well?

Bonus points if you also own Battleblock Theater, as you earn a bonus character, weapon, and animal friend to use in Castle Crashers."
27263,Very fun game until you decide to play with randoms.
27264,Good Games!
27265,"It's okay to make the campaing mode, after that it sort of dies out. Buy on sale."

27268,beat your friends for the princess kiss
27269,"Back in the old days, people actually finished games that were longer than 6 hours, included fun coop that had sequences that were awesome in coop or alone, and in all of those moments where modern game designers say ""Eh, we can reuse that one animation or decal or sound"" They instead doubled down and made 5 times as many as would have sufficed. 

And this was just flash games. 

Castle crashers is a glorious artifact of a dead generation of games, a generation that treated games like Art, and took pride in their work. The Coop is amazing, the gameplay is hilarious, and you will constantly say ""Oh my god, theres like, a bazillion playable characters and they each have a hand drawn animation for a part of the game that only happens in a 4 second span"" 

This is a game everyone should own, in my opinion. Its hilarious good fun that will constantly surprise you with how much detail the devs considered when building it."
27270,Castle Crashers is a fantastic beat em up game! playing it really takes me back to Streets of Rage and Dungeons and Dragons on the genesis.
27271,"When I was a kid, I play so many flash games in browser and this games bring backs memory, its funny plus enjoyable and this is not just a kid play, I mean there is challenge. I recommend to play with friends."
27272,"No replay value, but pretty fun with friends. And makes you want to punch your friends."
27273,"The game itself is good. It has funny moments and action and magic. I've tried to connect a new controller I got, and it didn't connect though. And the game doesn't give you tutorials about the keyboarded controls. Making the game much harder for those who don't own an xbox. Although I find the game fun and clever, I really do wish they can make it easier for customers, such as myself, to play."
27274,2hard4me
27275,great to play with almost anyone!
27276,"Good game, a lot of gameplay, and of course Behmoth jokes."
27277,Coop is fun but like most traditional beatem ups this game lacks depth.  Find some friends to play with and it will be a good time.
27278,"Pretty fun game, that is all..."
27279,rly like it llf
27280,"So the Castle Crashers® i really like the -----> ® <----- has blood , but jokes , time with friends and other stuff with story , really strange story but 2 hours of playing , makes your wallet be happy for you wasting money."
27281,This is a really good game. But the updates for it are kinda dead. Please make more levels and charecter models!!!
27282,I came here for the awkward Face expressions
27283,"terrible, absoluely terrible
"
27284,you punch
27285,"I've put too much time into this...JUST KIDDING I LOVEEEEEEE IT. Tons of fun, but way more fun with more people! Great party game."
27286,Its like avatar but includes swords
27287,"Its a Beat'em up mixed with an RPG. With Sandwichs and even Hidden Characters. Some are unlocked through playing the game, and others are unlocked by buying other games made by Behemoth. ( a.k.a Battle Block Theater.) If you're in the mood to kick butt, shoot arrows, eat sandwichs, and kill stuff. This game is for you!



                           And I just realized that I also described another game on Steam...   Thats free.... And is a Hat Simulator...."
27288,"well kinda fun with friends for a while, but after that .. meh"
27289,Only fun with friends but kinda short play story
27290,"This game is like my girl friend, i have non..... ;-;"
27291,YES. (Although I would easily reccomend a controller) this game is kinda fun when you try it. I may be biased but I dont care.
27292,"I love this game and everything it contains.

...execpt lava land...

...screw lava land..."
27293,Awesome game to play with friends!
27294,"Get Get Get don't think just buy awesome game (JK)

Real Review: This game is really fun and simple but the controls are a bit awkward with no controller. It is very funny and is a good game and has lots of levels. the downside is that there is no down side i rate this a 9/10 because the game itself gets boring but not that bad I you just realize that you are going to be hitting the same controls using the same strategy to play this game."
27295,"good game
"
27296,"Its a hack & slash game made out of cartoony doodles.

Kinda short but unlocking all the ""things"" means lots of replays.

Multiplayer is fun with friends.

Tons of heart and soul in the game.

Satisfying images.

Controlls are fluid (with a controller) but the constant heavy attack from above is OP and means you will probably spend alot of time floating on top of your foes.

Ai do there job, sometimes they spam you into corners but it's overlooked when you finally get the jump on them.

Music is Enjoyable to hear and blends with the areas.

7/10.
p.s my opinion means nothing, play what you like :) 

"
27297,"The game itself is pretty cool,i mean u have the knights with their magic powers.....
i always upgrate magic to the MAXX,then i upgrate other lame abilities like shooting arows tht never stop flying $_$....


That's all folks :3 :) x)"
27298,very fun if you play co-op

   Step 1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch springform pan.

   Step 2.  In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs and my big black cock with melted butter. Press onto bottom of springform pan.

   Step 3.  In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth. Blend in milk, and then mix in the eggs one at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour until smooth. Pour filling into prepared crust.

   Step 4.  Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off, and let cake cool in oven with the door closed for 5 to 6 hours; this prevents cracking. Chill in refrigerator until serving.

27304,just good game fun 2 play

3. Buy DLC's for the game

4. Play CS:GO

Castle crashers is an amazing game that has a cool art style, awsome music, a good sense of humor, and fun.  While it recommends a controller and has weird starting controls for keyboard, some tweaking in the options will let you play very easily with a keyboard.  Also, don't skimp on any one stat."
27315,The game can be a lot of fun with friends
27316,awsome game!!!!!!!!!
27317,"If you liked any beat 'em ups through out your childhood you'll love this one. The smooth animations, interesting enemies, HUGE array of weapons, animal side kicks, gameplay mechanics and variety of level design make this a 10/10. (PS Use a gamepad and invite your friends to play!)"
27318,I love this game I played it on Xbox 360 and PC. I gotta say this is pretty cool arcade like fun 10/10 would play again

27320,Pls like this if you want more levels and more cariter an idea like the wizard or the prince but just make more levels.

27322,Yeet
27323,"The old classic stand-by of Indie sidescrolling beat-'em-ups, Castle Crashers is still just as good now as it ever was. I have spent hours in this game with friends on local co-op, arming two people with controllers and one with a keyboard, then going out and facing whatever weird and wacky things this game decides to throw at us, moment to moment.

Still loads of fun, and a must-have for anyone's Steam library.

Cheers!

27325,a game that makes you want to kill friends
27326,"Ahhhhhhhhh, Castle Crashers, Where do I begin?

Castle crashers is a very fun game in which the point is to save the princesses from being kidnapped, it is very long and fun but that is what makes it interesting, I mean to beat the whole game, on every character, I would say 1000 hours and above, yeah, you heard me right, to unlock all the characters you need to beat the game on there 1st stage, 2nd stage, then 3rd stage, then beat them on insane mode, plus the 2 dlc characters that are 1.29 each! lDid I say 1000 hours? Make it your WHOLE LIFE! Once you beat the game on every character (INCLUDING INSANE MODE) you can reset your character's stats, however, if you don't, you can play arena mode and many more modes with all your levels! Or you can connect to a friend, beat the boss for him and get him a cool sword, you can also replay levels! Overall I am saying the value you are getting here is INCREDIBLE, SO MUCH PLAY TIME!!! So I seriously doubt you will be refunding this one any time soon, let alone get bored!!!

I LOVE THIS GAME!!!"
27327,"best game ever
"
27328,"The game has about 6 Play hours which is ok.
Sadly after some time the basic combat turns slightly boring but is still challanging.
Bossfights are proberly the best I have ever done and only these are worth the Money.
"
27329,"In my Opinion, this is a very fun game. There is a story mode, (fight to the death) mode and just a game mode. you will never get board because there are so many levels to complete. i do recommend that you use a controller to play this game, But playing with the keyboard and mouse is just as Fun. 


My overall view of this game, is you should buy it is you like Co-op, Adventure and if you like beating the craip out of your enemies."
27330,"great game played lot of hours worth the money hope the dlc""s come back out"
27331,"This game is just outright amazing. From the ammount of features, to characters, and weapons..
it's outright fun. Singleplayer or Multiplayer, you'll get the same ammount of fun either way."
27332,"Very very fun to play, great idea to have that four player competition going on throughout the game and enjoying the RPG element to this little keybored basher. Definetly see myself throwing alot of hours into this one."

27335,"The Children's Crusade was a failed popular crusade by European Christians to regain the Holy Land from the Muslims, said to have taken place in 1212. The crusaders left areas of Northern France, led by Stephen of Cloyes, and Germany, led by Nicholas. The traditional narrative is likely conflated from some factual and mythical events which include the visions by a French boy and a German boy, an intention to peacefully convert Muslims in the Holy Land to Christianity, bands of children marching to Italy, and children being sold into slavery. Many children were tricked by merchants and sailed over to what they thought were the holy lands but, in reality, were slave markets."
27336,"It's a really fun beat em up. The gameplay is simple, but it's fun to play.
When you look at the environments and bosses you have to appreciate 
the work that the animator did. The game looks great. You get a lot of
characters to play as and a lot of stages to complete.
When you complete the game it's not that fun to grind, but you still have the challenge mode.
The game is much more fun with friends. I really recommend it."
27337,"When you play against certain bosses sometimes think that you're playing Dark Souls 2D

10 of 10. Must have:)"
27338,Fum Game Runs on verythink but make sure to have a controller since it not the most keyboard frendly game :)
27339,"TO explaint this game in one sentace:
Total clusterFUN made by the behemoth.
Nuff said
"
27340,"Amazing coop game, a definite must buy for 2+ players game sessions.
Just some small tips:
-Experience is gained each time you hit (including magic multihits)
-Gold is NOT SHARED, not even in local coop, each character has their own gold stash
-Weapons are only shared in local coop, but multiplayer friends can trade weapons by picking up drops and switching
-Same as above for pets
-Potions function like lives ONLY with 2+ players, so if a solo player dies with 5 potions he WILL DIE, but if a player in a 3 person team dies he will lose a potion and be returned to full health.

What all of this means is that you gain less experience and money with more players. Which isn't all bad by any means, since with more people there is more damage to be dealt to enemies, and the number of enemies is always the same.
As the number of player increases its also easier to lose yourself in the heat of battle and take unecessary damage as things will get very chaotic.

So, my point is, the optimal number of player is about 2-3 since things won't get too messy fighting enemies/each other for money. 
But please don't take this as me saying ""Don't play single player/4-person coop"", the game is really fun either way, just more challenging with 1 or 4 people."
27341,this game is awesome! my most favorite game i have for now
27342,"i didn't play the demo but i dont care just play the game SPEND YOUR MONEY the games was hard at the times but guess what i loved it im addicted somehow i mean i could play for hours and already beat the game im almost finished but

27343,"Don't let the time spent on my Steam account deter you, as I've played countless hours of this game on my Xbox before picking it up here.
This game is incredible fun, and even more fun with friends.
A satisfying combat system, addicting gameplay, and a surprising amount of content.

I recommend this game, especially if you find it on a Steam sale one day.
Get this shit if you're looking for a humorous button mashing good time."
27344,"This game has been a favorite of mine for quite some time. I've had it on the PS3 for a long time, however, I wanted to try it out on the PC. The text, imo, is so much nicer and it overall is a better, more fun experience. If you aren't sure whether your computer can handle the game, there is always the demo, which most games seem to not have. Recommended buy!"
27345,"This is an awesome game! I remember this game on XBLA in 2008, and it still is aweosme, I still play it all the time with friends! The pc version is an awesome port! They just updated it to the Remastered Xbox One Version! And its awesome! :D Its a great game, Great new visuals, 1080P 60FPS, it runs smoother than butter :) Recommended :)"
27346,"This reeks!

[spoiler] Of Awesomeness! [/spoiler]"
27347,it is fun game if you play with friend
27348,"Decent, but overrated.  The combat and customization is great, and the multiplayer and trademark Newgrounds goofiness makes this a great party game. However, the experience/leveling is too overbearing; it controls not only the player's moveset and abilities, but also their health and damage-dealing ability. This kind of soils the experience by creating situations where the enemies either feel too tanky or too glassy, with rarely any middle ground if you play the game's levels out of order (or, if you play the game's tedious Hard Mode). And while the player character has diverse combat abilities, the enemies you fight start to become a little same-ish after a while.

As far as single player gameplay goes, I honestly would prefer to play Turtles in Time for the SNES.  Price tag is ""eh"", your milage may vary."
27349,Whats wrong with this game?
27350,10/10
27351,Hello
27352,"Good over all, after 20 hours it becomes a grind.  It pulls you in to play though again with a new character skin, since you unlock so many along the way to the end, and for completing.  However, it's not worth the grind a 2nd time though.  Fun to play with friends."
27353,"I enjoyed this game a lot.
Seems similar to battleblock theather for some reason. Both great games, recommended.

8.5/10
9/10 As a platformer

PROS
-gameplay's good
-not repetitive
-overral coolness
-fun

Cons:
-IT ENDS FRIENDSHIPS"
27354,"such a good game love it so much i had it on my xbox and just got it on steam



best game eber"
27355,"This game is a pretty solid game, where you need to either be patient or go in Leeroy Jenkins.
Of course, like many games, there is a tier list and the character power difference from the best and worse is so horrid that i'm afraid I will never be able to finish Hard mode with Hatty, because Hatty in all essence just sucks.
Until you meet the Ice King.
Then you start to ask yourself ""Was this Bungie's prototype for Destiny?"" 
Because he ISNT HARD.
HE JUST HAS SO MUCH  HEALTH
JUST LIKE THE ENTIRETY OF DESTINY.
Overall, pretty good game. I had fun killing my gf then kissing another girl in front of her in this game.
Red Knight is just so good in pvp."
27356,"Knights, princesses, king, evil guy, living corn, aliens, magic and pooping animals. This game has everything!"
27357,Very fun and great to do Youtube series on! Although I think they should make another map with a bunch more levels to keep going after you defeat the wizard boss.
27358,THIS GAME REMINDS ME WHEN I WAS A KID
27359,Cool game to spend some time with friends.
27360,"When i had the Xbox 360 controller plugged into it, it didn't work even though it worked for every other game I had? Just a disappointing sight to have seen because I baught the game to only play it with the Xbox 360 controller for when I have to go places"
27361,This game is inslanly replayable i love its huge amount of characters and its hilarious art style is awsome would reccommend to anyone who loves those beat'em ups and rpg type games
27362,Fight your friends over a kiss from a princess everytime you rescue one. 10/10 would destroy my friends again.
27363,"This is a fantastic game. A few bugs in Thieves Forest, but I've had few issues. I've also gotten every animal orb and am almost finished with weapons. If you like Beat-'Em-Ups and RPGs, this is a mix of both."
27364,An extremely fun game with friends
27365,"First of all, I liked the adventure and the accessories, though it would be even more amazing with clothes and/or hats. Another cool idea would to be able to turn into a new form - an animal would be nice or even merging with your animal orb. Further more, I feel like weapons should have a cool ability, such as the final boss uses his sword to make some sort of meteor shower. And finally, I would like to point out that there was very funny content that I would like to more of, I think that this would give the game far more appeal.

P.S. Add more DLC's too."
27366,"Solid game feel, playable controls, and amazing if you have 4 friends slicing shit with ya. Awesome game overall! Wish more people played nowadays though."
27367,;)
27368,.
27369,"It's fun to play multiplayer with you're friends. Get you an controller set to you're computer before you begin playing, it can just be me but i recommend to play with an controller. The keyboard is really hard to play with in my opinion. I would recommend it."
27370,"castle crashers was a big indie title when it first came out. And for good reason. it has fun saturday morning cartoon graphics. the controls are easily accesable but not much skill is involved in grinding to beat it. IT's humours crude or dumb which appeals to a mass audience of dumb simple people...

Im dissapointed theres no community to play with. I would have liked more content like a DLC instead of characters that look different but play the same. theres no real ROLE PLAYING to speak of and I LIKE beat em up style games but why cant we have the quality of the scott pilgrim vs the world or The warriors. 

I've finished it co op and got my money's worth but it's got no shelf life.... now to uninstall and I don't think i'll have a reason to re install"
27371,I love this game
27372,"This is an awesome game! One thing that could be cool is match making it will find people near your level and you could play because on some levels, it might hard if you don't have anyone to play with because i couldn't complete some levels but when i got my friend (basically the same level) and it was a bit easier. Anyways, love the game ! :)"
27373,its ok
27374,"9/10 
Still a better love story than twilight

27375,It is ok it can be better

27380,"This game is an amazingly fun 4-player co-op game, the art style is very endearing and ofc the game itself is hilarious."
27381,"good game, but to short in lenght."
27382,Get it.
27383,"Best sword fighting game to play with friends. I would reccomend this game for anyone, for any age, for any kind of gamer. What more do you want me to say?"
27384,This game is so amazing. It is like the internet sort of slapped you in the face and said HERE I AM WORLD!!!
27385,"DIZ IZ GAME IS Z
GUCHIE AS FK :3"
27386,"its like the nes tmnt game, butt when you are high off your balls"
27387,"I never found myself having that much fun whilst playing this game, especially at the time being.
For 1, most likely everyone will be a higher level than you if you get this game now
2, this game is extremely repetitive and generic since it's just a barebones RPG, simply put
3, My internet is fine and online disconnects me constantly.
"
27388,A perfect example of a game that is just fun.
27389,"this game is fucking retarded. i hate it so much the fucking story is gay as fuck. i really do not fucking reccomend anybody gets this fucking game. the music sounds like fucking autism, the weapons are fucking fake. where are the guns? i was fucking killing monsters and then i accidentally switched my fucking piece of candy for a fucking key. this is the gayest game ive ever seen. please fucking remove this from the steam store so nobody gets fucking down syndrome from playing it. jesus fucking christ please remove it i hate it so much."
27390,This game is awesome and last couple bosses need potions and sandwiches XD
27391,"Reminds me of the sentai show drama genre where you team up with your friends to pummel minions and bosses alike. If you don't have any friends, or none that have the game, you are not doomed. The artstyle is lovable and the humor alike. This is the game that got me hooked to the Behemoth and thier games, so will you?"
27392,this is a relly fun and addictive game. Plus 5 stars.
27393,"fun story, fun characters, challenging BUT it's too bad that you need the golden whale for pet achievement"
27394,Best when you play with your friends :)
27395,"This game is the perfect model for what it is: hit stuff and get stuff.

It's simple, fun, and straigtforward as well as funny at times. There's plenty to do, you won't beat this in an afternoon. It lets you play with friends easily and there are many characters to unlock and play. Lots of replay value.

My only big complaint is that the game doesn't work well with a keyboard. There's just no perfect way to set up the keys, and whenever you take a break and come back, you have to remember what each key does.

All in all, great fun game to play with friends, just bring a controller to plug in for maximum fun."
27396,
27397,"Good game. The difficulty is nice because you probably will not beat it in one go but it doesn't get so hard that its frustrating.

Waiting for friends to play with me!"
27398,Great Game! Supper addicting...
27399,"Fun game can play with friends but they can troll you or be annoying, but even when you finish the game you can re-do it and unlock new characters and it will take a long time to do this. Great game has unlockables, leveling up with attribute points to your character making him strong or weak but a wizard, you unlock new combos for fighting or new spells, there are achievements, boss batbattles, items that help you pass the game, PVP and of course making out with hot princesses"
27400,"While this game is deliciously enojyable, its limited replayability makes it a yawn after your first five playthroughs. This game honestly is worth more around six dollars than fifteen. I would recommend this game to literally anyone with an actual personality, because it has situations to which most can relate."
27401,"This game has a nostalgic vibe of a classic beat 'em up arcade game. Its cute and memorable characters made the game amazing with each stage shows us a comidic foreshadow of an upcoming scene. It has a near perfect multiplayer mode as it enables us to play with friends both local and online. Although we aren't able to play online with oter people, it gives us an arena map where we play and elimate our friends and be the last man standing. Overall, the game is brilliant to play even in singleplayer mode, but more like to play multiplayer with friends."
27402,Good time waster
27403,"love it but you cant get your stats back when you deleated them
"
27404,It's boring
27405,its fun to wreck my friend at the boss battles and kiss the princcese
27406,amazing game i orgasim like 20 times every 5 minutes
27407,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie 

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
27408,is not that good
27409,"A great and silly game to play casually with friends, though perhaps not so great to play solo. Its incredibly easy to learn and simple to play with plenty of unlocks to satisfy those hardcore completionists out there. Also, for such a straightforward game there is a surprising amount of replayability thanks to the number of playstyles and characters available."
27410,"Hilarious and fun, yet at times it can be frustratingly difficult. The art style is on point and definately adds to the overall experience. The storyline is just a tad shallow for my taste yet well thought through. A few levels become a real pothole and are a pain to get through. Fortunately on normal mode, you can redo levels to improve stats and get over them, but unfortunately in insane mode you do not have that luxury as your stats are maxed out and you have the best weapons. I would definately recommend this to gamers who love working hard for items and characters."
27411,"Do you like crashing castles? 

Then you'll love this game

10/10"
27412,Amazing game with great animated graphics.
27413,"Castle Crashers is the triumphant sequel to last year's hit, Unturned.  I gave unturned a 2 out of 2 and a half plus three and I stand by that now.  The whole game is different in this sequel though.  This is no longer a card game, but more of a simulator.  The turn based quick time mashes were great in Peter Jaxons new hit. The music in this F/<>ing game is so Fu><ing good.  With an original soundtrack by NWA,  you really learn to aprecciate the combination of smooth jazz with video games.  Man, this is one of those games that you start and just cannot put down."
27414,"oh castle crashers..
a fun game with nice graphics and soundtrack and a great gameplay.
in my opinion it really worth its 2.5$ bucks you might spend on."
27415,This is a great game!
27416,Top-notch.
27417,"A great couch co-op game from self-publishing developers The Behemoth (feels like I said that in another review :P). A great game which can also be played solo and online co-op. It's sort of an action-adventure where you fight baddies while progressing through levels. Loads of fun and especially fun if you're playing together in a local session. You can unlock new weapons and special pets that you can swap to improve and adapt to your particalur fighting style.

I have no clue which came first but The Behemoth delivers fun to play and humorous games."
27418,Fun brawler with fucking adorable pets.
27419,"Hech Yeah, When I got the money for this game I bought it stright away, Its great and funny, Got really good comdey and its just boss"
27420,"This is seriously one of the only side-scrolling beat-em-ups that I feel might rival Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for me. That, in and of itself should speak volumes.

Amazingly catchy soundtrack is coupled with vibrant graphics, crude humor, and a host of enemies, weapons, items and orb pets to keep you wanting to come back for more. Mix in over a dozen unlockable characters and you'll be playing this game for hours to come. Comes with both couch and online co-op (both of which can be intermingled) to allow you to enjoy this experience with many friends.

Honestly, I cannot suggest this game enough. It should be a Steam staple for everyone."
27421,Fun party game. Was a bit laggy on the multiplayer connection though. Finished the game twice then got pretty bored afterwards. If you looking for something to do for an afternoon with friends and got nothing better to play :) Only buy this if you are going to play with friends!!!
27422,10/10
27423,"A crazy, fun wacky adventure for either yourself or 3 friends/strangers. The combat is amazing, the pace is fast and the art is pleasing to the eye. This game is so fun that me and my brother completed the entire campaign in one sitting :D"
27424,this game ruined my life
27425,this is a really fun game

Seriously though, buy it now, you get to ruin a wedding"
27427,"This is overall a good game, fun story with small hilarious details, and multiple fighting techniques to enhance gameplay. This has given me mutiple hours of fun with unlocking new characters, magic, pets, and weapons. A great game that will dazzle you with its crude humor and ability to suprise you with creative ideas and boss fights."
27428,"Fun side-scrolling beat-em up with great music made from the newgrounds community. Some of the bosses can be frustrating, but worth it once you defeat them. Controls very nicely, especially with controller. Well worth the price."
27429,Good Game
27430,"This game is really only fun with friends, playing it by yourself is just a game of pressing Y and B, would not recommend this to the people that are alone and need to pass the time with games."
27431,So much fun playing coop with my kids
27432,"lots of fun. Hours of content

27433,"how do you buy necromance dlc?

27450,Its a good game. Very fun when you play with your friends.

I think this game is worth buying."
27462,"-NEWER REVIEW 
This game is really fun. Especially with a friend!
The controls are easy, (except on the voleyball level, I nearly ripped my hair out when I was doing it for the first time) the graphics are.... well... for a game like this, totally okay! And the story is, well not great but whatever, you won’t even care :D
Once you finish the game, you can pick some other character, and play it again!
There are other modes like the Barbarian one, they are somewhat fun, but you’ll be mainly playing the main story."
27463,"This game is very fun, and more fun if played with friends.
I love it <3"
27464,Fun game! Especially when played with friends

27481,"is nice game
"
27482,what the Fuck it is not saving my progress! WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????????????????????
27483,I like adventure and leveling and this game has that it can get old or slightly repetitive but if you have a friend to play with its just fun times so if youre getting this hopefully you have a friend to play with cuz that keeps it fresh and fun can go for hours with this and a friend
27484,DIS GAME IS AWESOME I RECOMMED IT ALLL THE WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
27485,"Castle Crashers is exactly what a 2D Beat Em Up should be. It's got good combat gameplay, excellent visuals, a fantastic variety of multiplayer modes, allows up to four players to play the game, great humor, plenty of levels, and a number of playable characters.

The game is cartoonish-styled, so expect a lot of over the top humor. Some of it is some mild black comedy, and there is some degree of blood and violence, comparable to TF2, but is slightly more mild.

The game has you in a (mostly) medieval setting, with the initial playable characters being four royal knights. There isn't much of a story outside of an evil wizard uniting several other kingdoms to attack yours for some kind of Magic Crystal (that the wizard directly steals) and claim the four princesses for varying reasons (only one is actually known to be held for forced marriage). Honestly though, in a silly beat em up that's as colorful and full of life as this one, it doesn't exactly need a big driving story. It just needs an atmosphere and charm to put on top of it's fun gameplay. And that's exactly what it has. 

The gameplay is action-packed, wave of enemies after enemies show up constantly as you move forwardi n each level. You learn more attacks and abilities as you level up, and you can also combo enemies through various means, but the main means behind doing that is to jump and knock them into the air, where you can stay airborn for a while by striking your trapped enemies in the air repeatedly. You can use this kind of tactic to trap multiple enemise at once.

Of course, not everyone is going to enjoy the genre, so for those that do, the only real downside to this game is that it's gameplay can get repetitive. Sure you learn more moves after a while, and enemies and levels definitely change up, but the core gameplay stays the same, and when the action is so constant, it might get tiring for some pretty quickly. All the more reason to take breaks from the game though, right?

Also, there are a HUGE amount of characters to unlock. It can be tedious (some methods are particularly complicated, requiring that you beat story mode all over again with one new character just to unlock another one) so that's one thing about this game I kinda dislike. Not personally, but I can definitely see why other people wouldn't find value in it. If you enjoy the game enough though, you might just see it as replay value instead, especially if you're planning to bring some friends along. And while playing through the main story in singleplayer is definitely enjoyable, this game is most definitely more fun when you're playing with friends.
"
27486,"If you have friends, then you should play this. If not, just play singeplayer.
10/10 would play singleplayer again"
27487,This game is amaaaaaazing! The amount of fun you will have playing this masterpiece is challenging yet fun. you will not try to break your computer but you will have difficult times. the fun just keeps on coming!
27488,"Great for Co-Op but not something you can play over and over without it getting a little old, in my opinion. For the first few runs and insane mode, it was worth it."
27489,Amazing freaking game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
27490,"One of the funniest games I played. It is a casual adventure because the game is not so difficult. It was fun to play because it is one of the games that I beat with my son. The art is simple but very expressive, as well as mechanical, but it combine very well and creates a fun experience. It is a indie game classic."
27491,It is a very fun game. Even more fun with friends.
27492,"Castle Crashers 
this is the best beat em up as they come
It was hilarious and fun all the way through
and the hardcore mode definitly lives up to the name
I love every bit of this game and it is amazing... amazing
the only thing i dislike a little is having to complete the game to get a new charater every time
I would definitly recommend this
"
27493,amazing
27494,it fricking amazing
27495,"Absolute Shite
"
27496,It's a really fun game and a great concept. there needs to be more gamemodes but apart from that the game is one of the best.
27497,I lover Castle crashers
27498,"I'd sooner watch a toaster cook an entire turkey, while punching my nan in the face, than play this game again, The worst game ive ever played. Barely makes sense."
27499,"A decently priced co-op game with the unique Behemoth artstyle, controller is recommended, if played with friends it can be loads of fun.

Would be nice of there was support for other controllers than the XBOX360 Controller."
27500,"the game is god and fun but it's get to hard when you playing alone or without a controller

27501,"This game is loads of fun, but only with friends. There's a lot of button mashing but it took me a long time to get through the grind of leveling"
27502,"This game is great if you like beating enemys up and slicing their heads off with skill and style.Hilarous and extremely entertaining,this game will keep you on the edge of your seat and your fingers will be sore after a full few hours of button mashing.Just remember to take breaks and go to bed if the clock says 00:00am so as not be sleep deprived the next day because you stayed up all night playing castle crashers.I would advise the red(lightning) or blue(ice) for beginners but its your choice.Look up the different knights strengths and weaknesses before you play as them so you can find the perfect one for your personal playing mode.Peice of advice...the evil wizard is female...

27513,"BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IM IN LOVE"
27514,"All i can say is, Simply hilarious and Reallly fun gameplay.
100% Worth the money"
27515,"At first, I thought there is only few playable knights. Then, what a big surprise, there are 31 playable characters, 26 animal orbs and so many weapons in the game. My favorite character is Alien (aka Alien Hominid) with his animal orb - Install Ball"
27516,one oftheciilest game ever
27517,This game is exactly a copy and paste from the xbox to pc. I would not recommend playing this using a keyboard as all the controls are setup to mimic a controller. Even the options in game to change keybinds is confusing.
27518,So addicting and funny
27519,crash castles like how i crash partys
27520,"I had fun with Castle Crashers for a while... 
But it lost it's luster very quickly and has almost no replayability value whatsoever.
Don't get it. Not worth."
27521,Nice game
27522,Solid.
27523,"HOLY MONKEY GUTS AND WOLF TITS 

The game is Neat +"
27524,Simple but good :D
27525,very fun game even better with friends i'd say its worth the $17
27526,"Absaloutly amazing. The game, The story, The comedy. Everything is absaloutley awesome. And speaking of which, Even after you finish the game you still have a some minigames. Just like battle block theatre. Made by the same guys. And playing other games of the creator will let you be diffrent charrecters like who i play as. HATTY! I reccomend this because its sure to get some good laughs out of you."
27527,"Pooping deers.
10/10"
27528,Iz gud. ye
27529,best gamre
27530,nice
27531,"I can't say any bad about this game.
Buy it, try it, do it.
It will make you smile at least once! :)"
27532,"Epic and hilarious game, it is a bit short though."
27533,Awesome~
27534,A Fantastily Fun Game. Especialy with friends. Cleverly animated and easy to pick up.
27535,Great game only a few complaints warning be prepared for a long ride though as in this game I have fond that there is no save button and the game auto saves after the completion of a level level thankfully dont take long but still. This only gets troubling at the end I found where you have to beat 4 bosses which are all in the same level which wont save if you die but rather if you beat all 4 . forgive me if there is more end bosses but i still haven't beat the 3rd because i end up dieng and not being able to progress. still an amazing game 8/10
27536,"This game is awsome!!!
I still find myself coming back and playing randomly
I love local co-op beat em up brawler games
its probably the best multiplayer game on steam"
27537,Very fun game to play with friends :) But I do not recommend this game for keyboards because you will kill it...
27538,"This game was delish it is a awesome beat em up game the graphics are nice, the combos are simple, this game can be humors and i blast to play with friends. Many many many playable characters the story is short sweet and to the point. The bosses were very whacky and wierd to a giant barbarian, to corn, ETC. You start out with 4 playable characters they're pretty basic each one has a magic ability. Orange has fire, green has poison red has lighting, and blue has ice. Most of the thousands of playable character's magic abilities are just shooting arrows kinda lame. long story short i think it is totally worth $14.99 and i highly recommend this game"
27539,"best game 10/10 ign would play again
"
27540,This is a very fun game.  Easy to just pick up the controler and start playing. My lady and I really enjoy this one.
27541,"Great price, great sense of humour, great art,  great customization, great animal orbs, great gameplay,

Great game."
27542,"9.6/10 - A timeless, challenging, friend-gathering game.

Castle Crashers is a brilliantly drawn, faced-paced and now 60fps delight. Knights, magic, humour and poo, all roll-up nicely into this side-scrolling quest to resuce the princeses and defeat the evil wizzard. The art sytle is brilliant, all drawn in Flash too, so it is crisp and clear. The soundtrack is also really good, and twins well with the quirkiness of the game. Characters are surprisingly well developed and unlockable characters are achived through gameplay rather than DLC (although there are a couple of characters available via DLC too). Each has their own style, weapon and their own magic abilities that become availble through leveling up.

Controls are easy to grasp, and mastering the combos is a case of learning on the job. The humor is at a level that children and adults will find amusing, which is why I recommend playing this with your kids. My daughter loves Castle Crashers, and will forever ask me to play so she can level up her favorite characters.

I hope a Castle Crashers 2 will be on the books at somepoint in the future. For now at least there is very little like this, and as such Castle Crashers will be a timeless classic. Highly recommended"
27543,"Me and my friends played it till the end of the campaign in one run. (approximately 12 hours) We regret nothing!












 P.S eyes hurt like hell!"
27544,This game is an absolute classic. Was blown away by it when I first picked it up on console and it is still just as fun as to play. Hands down one of the greatest arcade games ever. 11/10

"
27548,It costs too much for such a content(
27549,"Castle Crashers is a damn good game it's definately addicting and fun but the community is pretty much dead. Finding an online game takes a loong time and lots of times I end up not finding any online games. The controls are literally showing up as Xbox controls, meaning they did not put much time into porting it to pc. And finally the game recieves no updates almost at all. I don't even remember the last update. Overall I rate 6.5/10 I do not recommend buying it for $15, Although if you really like beat em up games like this one buy it during a Steam sale like I did."
27550,"Playing alone Castle Crashers is just another sidescroller with comic like graphics and a story so basic you could pick it up in the 1500's. 4.5/10
Playing with friends just makes it a little better. 5.5/10"

27552,"One of the best coop games, but also one of the worst singleplayer games.Just get some friends and enjoy this game"
27553,This game is really fun if you have friends to play with and is really easy to achievement grind but you need 4 friends / players to have the game for you to get one of the achievements ( its easier to have 4 friends play it than play online )
27554,"I love playing this game, though using the keyboard is a bit tricky. I've never used a controller before so really I wouldn't know which is better, but either way, this game is great all around. :v"
27555,I recommend
27556,"Great fun, may not seem like much but incredible game."
27557,BEST GAME OF ALL TIME!
27558,its a video game
27559,best game ever!
27560,"though it is recomended that you play with friends, this game is still fun on its own. its a solid beat em up with a bit of rpg elements and lots of magic indused PAIN. With all the different unlockables in the game, it really makes you want to unlock everything, and i mean everything. I got almost all charectures, weapons and pets on the PS3, and i intend on doing it again with the PC version with my friends (though it is recomended that you use a controller)."
27561,"
If you like 2D Action RPG Games, then this is the game for you. I definitely recommend this game. Totally worth the cash!"
27562,I became addicted since i had to fight with my friend for a kiss... 12/10 Must play again!

If not, then yonder in the fields of grass is the answer to whether to buy this game....and if yee are too smart then stop reading this.....but if yee ain't no aint't no no no then understand that yee just read this.....YANK!"
27564,It was fun to play with friends but you can only beat it once or twice before it grows stale.
27565,What's better than gaming with friends? Slaughtering countless knights with chainsaw-weilding friends! Sometimes PvP is a but unbalanced. Overall 9.5/10
27566,Very cool beat em up! Play it!!!
27567,"this game is pretty dam fun everyone
"
27568,"Despite what seems to be a very limited amount of time I spend playing this masterpiece,I played,finished and excelled at this game in the Xbox. That being said,the controls here didn't adapt,and the game acts like you are using a Xbox controller. So please be wary of that. However,this is a great remastering of this Newgrounds Classic. Graphics changed for a more polished look,and even today looks amazing. The same beat 'em up,crash,smash and grab style remains untouched,and is sealed airtight from (most) glitches. A must-buy."

27583,"What is Castle Crashers ?

Like any other Behemoth games, Castle Crashers is a charming game that is crazily fun to play, especially with a group of friends, it comes with a epic non-sense story full of humor, personality and craziness, every single behemoth games has something special on them, especially when it comes about their art design, the graphics and art design/direction here is very beautiful and well-done, the gameplay itself while being something common, nothing innovative like other Behemoth games, its still a fun game to play, theres ton of deep layers of gameplay here and its easy to come back and replay thanks to various game modes, from pve to pvp, different characters to play, items to collect and more, its a really complete package that will entertain you and your coop friend for hours, a must have for fans of indie titles."
27584,This game if REALLY amazing i'm almost done with this game.And what i mean by done  by achivements and characters and stuff like that.And my barbarien i had help beating the game with him and so i'm almost done.

27589,Deleted all my data by mistake 10/10
27590,"It's a very simple game that's made more fun with friends. It's not super challenging but there can still be parts where you can stuck at. Because the game's super simple, it doesn't feel all that engaging. The easiest way to kill things is to stun them with a standard melee combo. Putting all your points into strength also just makes it easy to steamroll most enemies. The game has multiple combos, but there just isn't much reason to do them.

The graphics aren't that great (feels low resolutionish) but I didn't expect much from an old console port. The aesthetics fit the humor which feels dumb but can also sometimes entertain.
Even with all this said, I think it can still be an enjoyable game with friends. I know I've had fun with it."

27631,"Castle Crashers is a unique, mini role playing game. It's nifty game mechanics make for such a supreme game style. This game is extremley obsessive, fun and one of the most time-consuming games ever. However, the amount of bugs were abizmal, every level there would be a glitch of some sort. However it made up for its extremley fun gameplay.

8/10"
27632,A wonderful game to pick up and play. Runs well on low end systems and has lots of content to enjoy. I reccomend picking this up on sale if you can but if you don't want to wait it's well worth the $15 pricetag.

27646,BEST GAME EVER
27647,"It could just be that I picked up this game early on so my childhood memories are clouding my judgement, but I greatly suggest you get this game. Its cartoony graphic style is clean and sustained throughout. As a game, it doesn't take itself too seriously and is more a comedic game than anything. Controls are simple and responsive. Tons of characters and an online mode (even though nobody uses it). This game is just great! Don't have cash? Not to worry as its most likely going to be on sale in a couple days! And I mean a couple days from the time you read this, not the time of this being posted. It goes on sale like every other sale rotation."

27652,goood but need more improvement

27654,Too good. It took more than 2 days to complete it and the comedy always brought me up with the poo jokes and comedic style. I would rate 10/10

27657,Best played co-op
27658,"Let me say, When this game first came out on Xbox 360 I put in well over 200 hours just playing with friends and messing around! This game on steam. well let me say it is 100 times better than what it used to be! This steam version has added some unique additions such as all characters being avaliable, and lowering the DLC to only two characters. This game is also great in the comedy section and multiplayer section. You can play with up to 3 friends while enjoying some great comedy! Please buy this game if you have the money it will definetly be worth it in the long run!"
27659,"Holy Crap

The key factors of this game are:

1. Kill
2. Kill
3. Watch animals $H*T
4. Ride a $H*TING ANIMAL
5. Have sex with a princess
6 Have sex with anther princes (there are four princesses)
7 More princess sex
8 And the last prinsess: Sex

10/10 would kill some more"

27663,Its cool.
27664,"Arcade Style Bashing Up the Enemies until your heart explodes, your eyes pop out and your tongue is left dried out and your skin is as wrinkled as your beloved nana's face. The Action is fun and intense for both casual and hardcore play. Really love the simple but dark comic art style in the characters and level designs. Overall this game is easy to get adicted to and should be adored by many new fans to come as I certainly am a believer of this game, thanks to my brother who got me into it, and ill certainly be telling my friends about it."
27665,A fun game indeed :D Definitely recommending this!

27673,Too many turd jokes for my taste. NEXT!!!
27674,"Fun little button basher.

This to me a great 4 player co-op game that you can play with any age groups. It doesnt take itself too seriously but the controls are solid enough.

There is a great deal of repitition but thats okay if you are enjoying the experience of co-op fighting. 

Its a tried and tested formula that doesnt bring anything new to the table but it does just work in as cute a manner as possible. 

Its good, but nothing too special."
27675,15 hours for kiss fake princess!
27676,"This is a great game and it is hours and hours of fun. Blood is rarely seen, everything is very cool and sometimes humorous (pooping forest) and that it's a good 4-player game, meaning that 4 people can have fun together. Many games can only have 1 player on each PC but this one can have 2-4 (if you have enough keyboard space). It is a good game for all ages. If you like this game, you should try 'Battleblock Theater' also by this amazing company called 'The Behemoth'."

27682,"Good game, but too easy. It took me ten hours to beat it, and after beating it once it got kinda boring. Tutorial could use some improvement."
27683,A simple hack and slash that is easy to get into and play with 3 other friends. 8/10
27684,"[b]Introduction:[/b]
Castle Crashers is a 2D hack and slash adventure game set in a cartoonish medieval world of knights, princesses and [strike]dragons[/strike]  pooping animals. Your only goal is to rescue the four distressed princesses from formidable foes and earn their kisses as a reward. This game is best played with two to three other friends, a controller, and a box of pizza to share.

[b]Pros:[/b]
-Over 30 unique characters and dozens of weapons to unlock and choose from.
-Cheap DLC characters with proceeds going to charity.
-Can be played on keyboard or a controller.
-Wonderful cartoonish graphics and easy-to-learn gameplay.
-Constant action and a simple levelling system.
-Crude humour with poop jokes.

[b]Cons:[/b]
-Game can get boring and repetitive after completion with multiple characters.
-Lacks a high number of achievements for achievement-loving gamers.

[b]Overall:[/b]
Castle Crashers is a fun game to play with friends and is a must-buy when on sale. It is simple and provides constant action throughout the story. Beating the game with certain characters unlocks other unique characters that all have their own pros and cons. With so many weapons, pets and characters to choose from, Castle Clashers is surely an enjoyable classic. My rating would be an 8/10."

27692,"Given how long this game has been out, and how many reviews it has gotten, I don't think my words will make a difference. However, I'm OCD about at least writing SOMETHING about a game I've completed, even if it's not the most helpful thing. For this game, I will simply say:

I saved the princesses!"

27700,"Never did play a lot of fighter games, but when I got this as a gift, I really have grown to love it. The humor, the art style, the gameplay, and the multiplayer, oh teh multiplayer, no other game has made it so easy to play with friends, on different networks especially. Overall great game to play with friends, or even by yourself."
27701,"Played on Xbox when it first came out. Incredibly fun arcade platformer, although it must be played with friends to get the most out of it. Would not recommend single player."

So many characters to unlock, very addicting gameplay, PLAY W/ FRIENDS. Creative bosses, hilarious storyline all the way through"
27710,"Fun game I remember playing it back on my Xbox360 years and years ago. Still holds it difficult yet humorous nature. Love this game, it's a classic and I definitally recommend it to anyone who wants a fun game filled with replayability due to the character unlocks with each completeion. If you haven't played this game yet Grab you Steam Wallet. Pay the $15. Grab 3 Friends. Play this game with them all night long!"

27727,It's alright
27728,Wacky fun beat them up in a comical art style.
27729,"    Castle Crashers is a indie single/ co-op game that is so addicting. By far one of my favorite games of all time to play. This game is so addicting its unreal. Once you play it once and beat the game you unlock more characters and you just keep wanting to do it (I've spent over a summer playing this game on my xbox). The story takes from 3-6 hours depending on fast you go. If your one of the people that do not like story on anygame mode that much, like me, it is nothing like you would think. Its really fun it has different skills like strength, magic, defense, and agility. Once you get the stats max the stats become great. Overall I would have to rate this game at least 9.5-10."
27730,Best game ever♥
27731,Very Good
27732,"Its an amazing game, great for parties."
27733,Need Castle Crashers® 2....and maybe 3

27738,Excellent Multiplayer Fun
27739,"If you're feeling bored with a couple friends and want a good old fashioned beat 'em up multiplayer fiasco, this is perfect. It's literally impossible to not enjoy yourself at least a little if you're playing this with a buddy or two."
27740,Great game 10/10
27741,"It was very fun with friends for a while, but gets boring. Still a very good game I spent very many hours in, though."
27742,This is my favorite game but im always looking for people to play with who own the game because not many people like the game :/
27743,Fun game. Good humor. Challenging but the grinding of levels can get repetitive and tedious. Different characters add to replayability but only slightly.
27744,"definitely my all time favorite game. I originally played this game back in 2008 on the PS3, but i decided to give it a shot on the PC. In order to properly play i would recomend using a controller, but besides that everything runs smoothly and it's rather enjoyable. I would recomend giving Castle Crashers a shot"
27745,i really like this game it looks dumb but its really fun
27746,"Truly a great representation of a side-scrolling, co-op, beat-em'-up game that's not only kills time but mutilates it. Making that time a limbless, carcass that might as well have never existed in the first place. Puting its soul to rest. Overall 10/10 c:"
27747,"It's a simple swing to kill, stay alive with buddies kind of game. Enjoyable for the co-op and versus approach to most games. Remember, only one can get the girl. ;)"
27748,"Nice game, play with ur friends and your salt-iness and friendship will rise"

[b]Castle Crashers[/b] is one of the best adventure and hack n' slash games you can ever play on Steam, giving you tons of fun (and, of course, rage) either alone or with a party of 4 players.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
-Nice cartoonish graphics;
-Over 20 characters to play, unlocked from time to time;
-Quite enjoyable gameplay;
-100% gamepad support (including mostly a Xbox gamepad);
-Bug free;
-Pets and weapons to collect, each one with benefits and/or with penalties.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
-Repetitive gameplay, with no changes on story;
-Extremely difficult Expert mode (dangerous to go alone)

And this is why I advice to buy and play this game, OR just simply try the demo to check out. I also advice buying when on sale, because most times it's 50-75% off.
Oh, and an extra minigame is included, giving you more fun time than only playing the normal gamemode."
27763,it's ok
27764,"fun quirky and just silly

i reccomend"
27765,"One of my favourite games <3
Fantastic for 2-4 players, but single player is awesome 2"
27766,amazinggggggg
27767,"If I had a choice between having sex with a woman or playing Castle Crashers, I'd probably still choose sex with a woman.

But afterwards I'd tell her to get the ♥♥♥♥ out of my house so I can play Castle Crashers.

But seriously, this game is really funny to play with people : such as friends (if you have some) brothers, sisters etc... This is really an awesome game ! 
It's just that the story is a little bit too short but yeah, there is still multiplayer righty ???
If you have money to spend, I'd recommend you to spend it on this game."
27768,Hakim
27769,"This game is one of those games you just wanna keep playing for hours at a time sometimes. I rate it 10/10 for just overall being a great game if you like medieval type games with magic.
"
27770,"i give it a Meme Out Of a Meme
"
27771,Really fun to play with friends!
27772,THIS GAME IS AWESOME! BUY OR DIE THEY ALWAYS SAY!
27773,"An absolute masterpiece of its kind. A truly rare gem in the midst of a sea of ​​unsuccessful clones. There are two years that I play, I finished it many times but still can not get bored, especially if played in 4 players. The hard mode is a true ability challenge.

Awesome. Everyone hope for a Castle Crashers 2. Would be nice too.

7.9/10"
27774,Very fun game with friends or solo. Hours of countless fun.
27775,very good  game recommend it if you have a spear 15 bucks buy this game (:
27776,"Cwaso casors ast su faan. - Booneigh

But it's good."
27777,"Castle crashers is balanced, hilariously fun, a co-operative campaigns dream, it’s the whole works! 

Brilliant gampley accompanied with a amazing art styles and humour that will make anyone smile this game definitely is one of the greats out there. It’s a gem to play with friends and is rewarding when you do so. Single player is just as good though having a friend can prove helpful at times.

Highly recommended with a controller.

Gameplay 9/10
Aesthetics 8.5/10
Story 8.5/10
CO-OP 10/10

OVERALL 8.5/10 – A must play for co-op gamers."

27779,Amazing game. Definitely worth 15 dollars
27780,One of the only games that I actually find myself coming back to over and over again. It's great fun and highly recommended.
27781,"I bought the game when it was like 90% off but ended up being quite fun actually.

The gameplay and plot are cool and the ability to play with friends and others is what makes this game shine in my opinion.
Would recommend to anyone."
27782,Castle Crashers is a classic game to play with your friends with silly graphics and cool animations. Definitely 10/10
27783,"10/10 i love this game for the fact that you can customize beyond your wildest dreams
"
27784,fuck no
27785,10/10 i will laugh again
27786,"Strange how im ok with the Newgrounds-based humor and use of animals crapping themselves in the forest
...Yet I find the piles of poo in 'Binding of Isaac' the most disgusting, gag-inducing thing ever.

10/10 -would ride a shit-rocket-powered deer to escape a giant deranged cat again."
27787,"This is a very good beat-'em-up style game, and a good time-waster at that. There are many fun bosses and interesting enemies, as well as a decent storyline to put it all together. There are a few weird cutscenes where the animals are defecating, though. Very good multiplayer setup and overall one of my favorite games on Steam. I have never gotten bored playing this game. The endgame is a little rushed, but well worth the erratic boss patterns. Insane mode unlocks after the main game is beaten, and that's a gigantic struggle."
27788,"0/10 didnt crash castles

lol jk iz gud"
27789,"I used to play the game on xbox and found it fun. its still good.

many different characters and magic.

good enemies and bosses.

perfectly playable in singleplayer.

27798,"Was pretty much perfect when first released on Steam... Then it all went downhill. 

+Fine simple plot (no dialogue other than gestures/voices)
+Can be fun in multiplayer
+Plenty of different characters, pets & weapons

-No in-game lobby, voice chat or being able to write even after 4 years...
-...we received minigames of which you'll be bored to death in five minutes instead
-Unable to search public games anymore or customize searching; exchanged with hosting a game instead (makes complete sense)
-Some characters, pets & weapons are overpowered, some are absolute rubbish (terrible balance, especially in PvP)

Done with commercial Newgrounds games."
27799,"crashing castles till the gmae crashes... nuff said.
10/10 would fight teammates for a princess kiss again"
27800,Very fun and addictive. I reccomend geting battleblock theater as well.
27801,dont get this game; it's terrible
27802,this is the best game on earth for ages 14+ play it at least 10 hours a day
27803,"If you currently do not own a controller, don't bother buying this. The controls aren't even shown on the game, and need to be looked up to be shown. If you have a controller, then go ahead buy it, but even then it's still not that great of a game. It gets repetitive and boring after beating the game once. Getting your character higher level just becomes a grind for exp and a waste of time."
27804,"amzing game you can even be a spooky skeleton!
"
27805,"Pretty addicting and fun until you beat it, but the only reason to play it after you've got all the weapons unlocked and items unlocked is to try and get atleast one character max level and then collect all the characters and achievements. Well unless you really want to max out a lot of characters."
27806,it's great
27807,yum

Completed it with my sister so  so so many times when we were younger on our XBOX 360.

9/10- IGN"
27813,Extremely fun game.
27814,"I love this game, its just plain old awesome :D:D:D"
27815,Definitely a fun game to play I just wish I had friends who liked to play this type of game haha
27816,"I got into this game VERY late...but it's multiplayer bliss on Steam that few games can compare with. 

It's very reminisent of co-op Konami arcade games of the late 1980's that you used to pump quarters into.

Highly recommended even though it's an old title."
27817,This game was worth it on Xbox360 and I hated HATED the 360.  Was it great enough to purchase it multiple times?  Hell yes.  This is a fun and amazing game.  So silly and interesting.  Flash players and arcade party nuts will enjoy.
27818,"Day 1: Cool characters... i guess ill be the fire guy...

Day 420: I MUST COLLECT ALL CHARACTERS AND MAX THEM OUT!"
27819,<3 :D
27820,Good multi player hack and slash. Good comedy as usual from this team.
27821,Good game to play with your mates.
27822,"the castle are the castliest, the draw bridges are the draw bridgiest, the swords are the stabbiest"
27823,"Awesome Adventureous game with a lot of fun moments, story feels a little short and its replay value seems less and less each time you make a new character. Multiplayer will make or break your experiance with this game, its the difference between remembering it as a great game rather than a good one."
27824,Straight forward super fun game.
27825,"A really fun, entertaining game. Terrible to play without a controller, so this shouldn't really be a PC port as they did not optimise it to work well on a keyboard, it's hard to just press A to move left, you can't as you have to use diagonal, so a joystick is essential.

While I like playing this game, keyboard controls are frustrating and if Iam playing on PC I shouldn't have to use a controller to be able to play a game. I use a razer gaming keypad and that still does not work well with the game. So I had to use my PS controller to be able to play the game properly. Though the controls it lists are for XBox controller.

Don't recommend this game if you don't want to use a controller."
27826,Sandwiches are tasty.
27827,Pleasantly Surprising. Really really good.
27828,"I'll recommend it. The game itself is so unique, and I don't really know How to describe it. It is just so good. Even after beating normal Mode and half of insane Mode, AND getting to level 99, it still is fun and addicting. One of the Best games I have ever Played, and I totally recommend it."
27829,"Good Gameplay And Storyline
Play With Friend
Get All The Collectibles
Watch Deer Farting Poop

Good Game 100/10 :)"

27831,'s good
27832,"It's a good game, I very like it
"
27833,Nothing but adicting! 10/10
27834,"This game is very fun, without a friend or with one it's a pretty good play, very good time waster and even just for story, whatever you want to do. Keyboard controls aren't the best but you can get used to them, but you should probably use a controller so if you don't have one that's a downside but overall this game is very enjoyable."
27835,"Fun gameplay, funny storyline, awesome co-op, overall great game"
27836,best game ever made

11/10 playing alone again"
27842,"Need help to defeat the boss or insane mode.Just message me still playing until now 

1/20/15"
27843,"This is a wonderful arcade game that brings back those nostalgic days of web browser flash games during school. It has wonderful derp art and animation. You can invest your time into completing the story, play the PVP arena mode, or barbarian keep-away game. It is a very cheap game when on sale, but it is a great game to play with gamers of almost any skill level. There have been moments where I've gone online to follow and play along with strangers for hours. You can also purchase this game and browse Twitch for streamers that may be playing this game from time to time. There are collectibles and the challenge of reaching Level 99 with each knight. The computer spec requirements are also very light. As a casual, this game does not have too much to obsess over when needing to focus on other priorities in life."
27844,"Good graphics,Fun Beat em up And Best Soundtrack In all games Ever"
27845,This game is fun. Somethings may be confusing but playing the game is fun. Online is fun if people participate.
27846,"SO FUN PLAY WITH AHOTHER PEOPLE
 sooooooooo good look how long i have played for and still love it i have played the Whole game and i am lvl 45 top lvl in the game is 99 (this is cringe now - 2021) 
2022- edit
I highly recommend you play this game its just one of the best video games ever (specially with a friend) still level 99 is the highest level on any characters but hardcore mode is a thing you can play too if the game is too easy. i just hope everyone at least tries this game (remember you can get a refund as long as you haven't played 2 hours of a game and haven't had it for 2 weeks)"
27847,"At first it's hard to learn how to play, but if you play it with friends, it's funny."
27848,I love this game. Been playing it since 2009. Some of my favorite gaming memories!
27849,"Funny game gifted to me by a friend. I can give it a good 8/10 because at the time playing it, I never felt angry it was just good fun."
27850,Setting your friends on fire! 10/Used Napkin!
27851,"really awesome game. awesome knight's, 2D , weapons!,bosses! , pets!
and.... volley ball?? but overall its a nice and addictive game"
27852,Really good game with a lot of fun. Great mechanic's. A lot of fun when played with some friends. Too bad its not updated anymore.
27853,This game has consumed my soul.
27854,great game
27855,it is fun
27856,"Its a glorious game with plenty of nostalgia, shame its also exploited by some."
27857,"Castle Crashers is really fun, and it has a lot of playtime. However, often I find myself stuck on a boss that requires me to play through a whole level multiple times. Often times this gets boring. Overall, the game is fast paced, and fun, aside from the occasional slow spot. It is also very fun to play with friends."
27858,"One of the funnest 4 player local co ops we have been able to find.  Only problem is the story mode was kind of short, wish it was longer.  Great fun for 2 adults and one ten year old girl, we ended up playing it so much we beat in a few days.  Great fun"
27859,So fudging awesome with hatty.
27860,"What a game a fun game to sink several hours into, highly advise playing with mates because it a greater time and adventure to go on"
27861,i really enjoyed this game 10/10 i would buy battleblock theatre aswell but one thing i would not enjoy is that you beat the game and get a new character so you play it again but to get the character you want youve already beaten the game like 18 times so i enjoy it but it gets a little boring after a while
27862,"Its fun but it can be frustrating at times. Leveling up is so slow that you will have to replay levels in order to level up enough to progress without getting destroyed, which can be boring."
27863,REALLY GOOD BUT I LAG A LOT
27864,i loved castle crashers demo on the playstation alot i would sit there and play the demo for hours i realy recomend to buy the game to get the full experince and also remember the #1 rule to team work is dont be a dick
27865,the sound doesn't work right
27866,"ummmm freaking one of the best games ever made? It's just so fun. It has a charming and cool artstyle that can be funny OR serious, it has some of the best co-op/versus multiplayer action ever SEEN in a beatemup, and it has a banger soundtrack. What more could you even WANT?"
27867,"Castle Crashers...

A game that has flawless controller support, gameplay, local multiplayer, and levels. +4

The playable characters consist of knights, baddies, and a love... kight... (GENIOUS!!!) However, I'd like some more variety... +1.5

The graphics to this game is obviously not it's strong point, but the artstyle surely set this game apart from others. +1.5

The story is the simple 'damsel's in distress, save her hero!' (It's strong point is mainly the levels and bosses) -1

The DLC is completely optional, and the price is fair. It's only there if you like the game (Which I do) +0

The music in this game fits the tone, but sometimes I felt as if the music is not memorable in some areas. The sound, however, is great! Whenever I hit my opponent, the sound that it makes me satisfied yet starves my adrenalin. +3

Overall: I recrommend this title, but it can be a bit repetative at times. 7.5/10"
27868,"This game is awesome

27869,"Got the 4 pack, and a team of 4 people and we had hours of fun. Strongly recommend to play with friends."
27870,"The art style of the game is incredible and the soundtrack itself fits in perfectly (example at the bottom) , from knights with laser swords in high tech armor (high tech compared to other knights), an alien ship, a castle that is made out of robot parts to a guy playing a piano that is equipped with rocketlaunchers,
im not exactly sure what the campaign was about, but that didnt really matter since the actual gameplay itself and the amount of crazy events is what keeps you playing,
from Voleyball against enemies, crazy bossfights (for example: a ""derped"" dragon that has a muppet on his hand, a catsfish which lets pandas ride on its back) and Arena fights to battling your friends, this game is overall one of the best and craziest coop experiences that you will ever witness.

27871,That feel when a game called Castle Crashers crashes your computer. xD
27872,Love it.
27873,This game is great! I love playing it with other friends and I love that I can play over and over with new characters. GG
27874,"It's great, it has great online , not that lag and you can replay it tons of time, as it unlocks new stuff each time you get through it. It is basically , a good game. Sadly , the online doesn't work like it used back in the days because of the new update.

The lag also isn't that bad :3"
27875,Very Good Game and Pastime! Price-Quality Ratio is Perfect!
27876,is god god geme
27877,"If new adventures were added to this game + harder places to beat, this game would improve and gain more people buying it. Overall, this game is really fun and worth $15.00. I would recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have an extra game to play and only plays about two or three games. This game has nice challanges and achievements that you can unlock and it's great for parties."
27878,"Dont understand the hype. Shit.

EDIT: I NOW RECOMMEND. I WAS WRONG, THE HYPE IS REAL."
27879,"I love this game! I played it on the xbox for a while but now that it is on Steam, I love it even more."
27880,"So far its pretty fun. I have to really be in the mood to play it though, 3/5 would play multiplayer with wife again and make out with npc and have her get mad again."
27881,This game is the best I like play it everyday
27882,it gud
27883,really fun game pink knight is best dlc
27884,This game is nice when you play with your friends.
27885,It's fun to play if you're bored. It's fun with friends as well.
27886,good game for you all
27887,"the best game ever!!!!!!!!! 10,000/10
"
27888,"Horribly addictive. My hands are sore. Played it through to the end (alone and with friends) when it first came out long ago on Xbox. It's still the best looking, silliest and most captivating levels game around!"
27889,Turns friends into enemies
27890,Better with friends but you can play by yourself and earn as much leveling as you can so they wont steal your experience
27891,"funny, fun, and unique"

27893,I am in love with this game! Something about it makes it so perfect. I have been telling all my friends about it and pushing them to buy it because co-op mode is HUGE fun. This is a must buy game and highly recomend it. It has a cute artistic style with awesome fighting and a little dark hummor mixed in. Buy it or put it at the top of your wishlist because it is worth every penny!
27894,women getter sim
27895,"Still a better love story than twilight.
I mean u beat the shit out of your friends to get a kiss. why not ?"
27896,"You need a team with this game.
Solo play isn't very enjoyable.
So if you're looking for a fun solo beat 'em up this isn't it.
It really does require 2 players to be much more accessible and playable.

Loved the artstyle though."
27897,try not to suck in co-op and die all the time so your teammates have to keep reviving you it really ruins the experience *cough* Sodium Calide *cough* *wank* *cough*
27898,you can play as Hatty if you buy Battleblock Theater :D
27899,"This game is fantastic for young kids and parents to play together.   Buy four controllers and play on a single laptop, or buy the 4-pack and play on four computers.    We play cooperative multiplayer games exclusively, and this game is one of our favorites."
27900,"It takes such a simple concept of going through level to level and killing enemies, and makes it such a unique and addicting game. Between individually leveling characters and using the skill points to turn your character into a certain, it makes this one of my favorite games to play."
27901,Fun especially with friends
27902,Its ok
27903,A pretty cool game
27904,Surprisingly fun game.
27905,Yo this game fucked me up gooooooood!
27906,"great game, its so addicting. but its better if u can customize the character as well"
27907,"Amazing game, proud to own it and it goes on sale for really cheap so just about anyone can own it. I bought the 'Can't Stop Laughing Bundle' and haven't been disappointed in either game. Play with a friend or multiple friends for an even better experience. 
Also, I own all the DLC and it takes alot for me to buy any DLC, so props to this game for that too. I own it on xbox 360 as well, but personally this version is better."
27908,never thought they would ever update this game again but itsssss great
27909,"Amazing game, unlimited potential, never ending fun and never gets boring. I challenge you to beat insane mode withouth using any health potions"

27913,"BEST GAME PLAY ALL TIME 10000000000/10 WOULD PLAY AGAIN!!!
"
27914,"If you like beat'm'up games, Castle Crashers is EASILY a good choice.

It's fairly basic gameplay mixed with the bright colourful graphics, and surprisingly well-designed stat-point system makes for a fun, exciting, and unique kind of game; despite it looking really ""kiddy""

I love it, and, if you still haven't played it, you really should.

Get it for yourself, and see why everyone is out crashing castles!"
27915,"Pretty fun game. The art style and music in the game are awesome, and it's a great game overall."
27916,If you like killing barbarians and ninja pirates this game is for you
27917,"Great party game!

Pros:
-humour
-different charcters with different skills
-fight for heart of the princess
-funny bosses
-shitting deer


10/10 would ride shitting deer again! :D"
27918,"Castle Crashers is one of those games you can play over and over and still enjoy, especially with friends. Definitely one of the best multiplayer games you can buy on Steam. You're in for plenty of hours of fun with this game, and a substantial amount more if you play it with friends."
27919,"An absolute blast with friends. Okay when alone.





Or just play with some random people because you have no friends, like me. Works every time."
27920,"are u able to get hatty or the golden whale?
"
27921,"This game is underservedly overlooked....somehow.

27922,"I love this game its amazing story line coop multiplayer 10/10 ign i recomend it for all ages over +7
I play with my friends
I play by my self ;-;
And every time im on steam i Play this godamn game"
27923,"Really great game! Very fun beat 'em up game to play with your friends! Infinite hours to play and no way boring! I highly recommend this fun indie style co-op action beat 'em up game to play online or with your friends. Even playing alone is fun too to level up and to try to get the top stats in the leaderboards! I am very happy with this game, I bought both DLC's and BattleBlock Theatre just to unlock a character. Obsessed? Pffft, you try the game and tell me you aren't! heheh ;)"
27924,There should be a meh option.  It was ok.
27925,"Halirious gameplay, unique battle mechanics, and fun with friends; Castle Crashers is by far one of the best games out there. However, its ""un-fun"" without a controller.. so get one so you can play!"
27926,Is okay but very repetitive without adding anything new and interesting
27927,"Fun and chaotic gameplay, awesome music, and tons of replay value, Castle crashers is a MUST play for those with a thirst for chaos especially with freinds. I give this game 10 tentacles up."
27928,Crazy game !!! Love it :3
27929,Great game. A simple concept but a lot of fun especially with friends. Several hours of great times and it never gets repetitive.
27930,This is one of the best co-op games out there.
27931,I love this game. I played it with my brother before getting my own copy and my nephew beat me when he was 3. He's put in over a 100 hours into this damn game. It's a great game and I want all my friends to play it
27932,Its Cool
27933,cheapgamebutfun2play
27934,This game is amazing

27942,"Really fun game, i really enjoyed it! Try it"
27943,8/10 never really got into this game as much as everyone else beat em ups are kinda dumb but this one kinda isn't
27944,I love it!
27945,"Cannot play multiplayer, cannot find any online games. It sucks to play alone, a total disappointment for me"
27946,an amzing game i love playing this with my friends its alot of fun
27947,"I love it.
this game is funny creative and easy to play and the controls are simple to use as well. the dlc's are worth it.
I give it a 10/10"
27948,"I've been playing this game with my girlfriend like crazy lately, she uses the steam controller while I use the keyboard while my Alienwar laptop is plugged up to my Vizio TV via HDMI cable. (Very Good Setup)
One of the funest games I have ever played with my girlfriend, she hardly plays video games but took to it amazingly and is better than me at it in most aspects.

Never a dull moment with unique storyline and detailed backgrounds and characters.
Mini-bosses and Huge Boss battles that are fun and challenging.
Awesome comedy, you'll be laughing all the way to the end at the hilarious moments in this game.
Tons of weapons and animal followers to collect.
Awesome Level Up system, you really feel a sense of accomplishment every time you level up or defeat a boss.
And, Just when you think ""oh this again?"" you are slapped in the face with some new crazy stuff like ""oh my god thats soo awesome and funny!""""

Great Game. 

NOTE:: 

You should only buy this game if you want endless hours of 'arcade like' fun and one of the best games you will ever spend your money on. This will become one of those Gems in your Steam Library where even when you beat it you will look back and be like ""God that was fun. I should play this again!"""
27949,there are skeletons very good
27950,fake and gay
27951,Play'd it on the Xbox360 loved it. Personally i think it 100x better here on steam
27952,very fun game to play kept me on for hours if it ever goes on sale grab your self a copy!
27953,"deer propelled with the power of it's own pooping, 11/10 would r8 again"

27955,not my style game but fun game different job class would be a good addition to extend gameplay 6.5/10
27956,MELHOR JOGO DA MINHA VIDA
27957,"Fun game!
Got this on steam-sale for me and my girlfriend, we had a ton of fun. The games a little short but nothing wrong with it as there is ""insane"" mode. Fun hack and slash."
27958,"If you have three friends, you're this late to the party, and you've been wondering what all the fuss has been about for the past several years, what are you doing. Play this game."
27959,This game is very good and fun. 10/10
27960,"Gather some friends and [i]gamepads[/i] for this one! Castle Crashers is my favorite since Alien Hominid, but in general buy anything from [url=www.thebehemoth.com]The Behemoth[/url] or [url=www.vlambeer.com]Vlambeer[/url]."
27961,"BEST GAME EVER
LOL IM LOVING IT
"
27962,"This game is awesome but it would be way better if there was better online support and different playing options, like playing as an enemy. Fun Single player, but way better Muliplayer"
27963,Sup
27964,"This game is the best I grab a 4 pack every steam sale, perfect gift for friends! Very fun to play solo or with friends."
27965,That wall tho
27966,Its a great game :^)
27967,this game. omg
27968,10/10
27969,Best game ever its super fun to play with friends also its fun to play alone if u can make castle crashers 2 its gonna be amazing  best game ever 100/10
27970,"Great game. Simple, fun Hack & Slash."
27971,"Pros:
-Very fun when you have friends
-Combat is simple and easy to understand

Cons
-Leveling system punishes you for leveling up Strength/Magic
-Horribly designed boss fights
-Characters are only different by their Magic
-Back off Barbarian's difficulty comes from your lack of control"
27972,"Gud game. Has multiplayer, saving princesses, and the action is pretty nice."
27973,"Just beat people to death
"
27974,It's an awesome game! I hang out and play it with my boyfriend usually!! hehe
27975,"Probably put hundreds of hours into this game when I played it on Xbox 360, and thought I'd pick it up on steam because I loved it so much.

The artstyle, the humor, the characters, the weapons, the level designs, the soundtrack, the bosses, this game is pure fun to be had, especially if you have friends or family to play it with.
 
If you are a fan of classic arcade style gameplay, I highly recommend this game! 
"
27976,it is relly fun when you unlock a ton of things.
27977,"sick
"
27978,"Great game, I'd reccomend it to anyone."
27979,"My breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
11/10"
27980,"Amazing game, such fun. Wish I didn't have to use a controller though"
27981,"Incredibly fun co-op gamplay, still good solo, cannot recomend enough, this game is absolutly amazing. If you and your friends want a good co-op game take this one or others from the same creators like Battle block theatre."
27982,"Great game.

Play with yo friends, beat game: ""this was easy""
Play Insane Mode: ""Screw this""

11/10 - Insane Mode is mentally challenging (pun intended)"
27983,"Highly recommend if your looking for a fun multiplayer game,"
27984,"The game has all of the original version and multiplayer feature allows you to play with friends all around the world. The game sets it up so that is's fun to play a level again and again. The bosses are memorable and exiting. You can play local or over wi-fi. You can use a Xbox controller, witch really makes the game more exiting. There is a lot of playable characters to unlock, there is also a lot of collectibles, such as weapons and sidekicks. You can only complete the game by replaying it more times and it is totally woth it. You will spend a lot of fun hours playing this game. I would recomed this game for gamers or casuals who like classic NES games or if you liked battel block theater (but they are totaly different). I wuld give it 4 of 5 stars."
27985,I love this game. It is most fun when with friends but is still very fun solo.
27986,"this is a really fun game to play, especially when u play with ur friends. You can play a storyline with your friends, and/or even have a little competition with them in arena mode. GET THIS GAME ITS FUN"
27987,"LOL I LOVE THIS GAME. online is a little laggy but, it's not too bad."
27988,"its really hard but its a good story 



(read this if you not gonna buy the game)







its a story about a kingdom then its get attacked then you have to save 4 princsesss
and get the gem of life"
27989,great especially with friends.
27990,"A fun game to play alone, or with friends! Doesn't get boring, cheap dlc, and a wonderful story!"
27991,"If you like games you will be happy because this is a game.
10/10 its a game.

"
27992,A fun chaotic and humorous game. Though short its definitely worth your money. 7/10
27993,"THIS GAIM  MADE ME CUT EFF ME DIIICKKKKKK PLZ BO SOELL N OMORIE XDDDD@#!@!
"
27994,it  amazingly good
27995,"So I liked this game. But not enough to leave a positive review. I think it could have been so much better for way too many reasons to write them down. 

It's a good game if you don't know how a good beat em up should be like."
27996,"I would rate this game 8 out of 10. I like this, but think there should be some more dlc to make the game longer like the king went missing or something."
27997,"Nice game, funny and amuzing 10/10"
27998,"everything poops when it's scared
10/10 shit simulator, would see explosive diarrhea again"
27999,I love this game. <3
28000,I haven't been out of my house in 72 hours
28001,One of the best games I can say I have played and beaten...I love Castle Crashers...tonnes of fun and look for my name on YouTube for my Let's Play of it!
28002,"This is a nice, light RPG slash beat-em-up slash adventure game by the guys who brought you Newgrounds.
One of Behemoth's First titles (The other being Alien Hominid) This one has taken off, and you can find it on just about everything (I hear there's one for TOASTER soon).

Pros:
+ Lots of unlockable, playable characters
+ Redicuous 'story' that should get you a few chuckles
+ Easy to grasp controls
+ Fairly easy learning curve
+ 1-4 Player Co-op
+ Flexible leveling, weapon and pet system, so your style can be vastly different from character to character

Cons:
- Not always intuitive how to unlock certain characters
- DLC and bonus characters aren't that great in later gameplay.
- Desert. Just the stupid desert area."
28003,11/10
28004,"This game is a must have,  I love it so much. The animations, art, and backgrounds are all hilarious. There is a good story and is just very well-rounded. This game is also really fun to play with a friend."
28005,"It's been said a thousand times: Castle Crashers is one of, if not the best modern beat-em-up. On PC, it's the best I could find, at least. All th elements of a great game are here: multiplayer support (local gaming on PC, how long I've waited for you...) an engaging single player campaign, a progression systems, stat customizing weapons... Wether you want to relive your childhood as a TMNT game fan, or just wail on some poor guy until a bigger guy comes up, this is for you."
28006,Best couch game to play with friends
28007,wwww
28008,Fuck you
28009,cute little game to play with friends.
28010,"somebody plz help meh im stuck at a level

btw 10/10 would slice fukin thieves"
28011,"I've played many games like Zelda, Mario and Donkey Kong and some levels in this game reminded me of all those games. But at the same time it feels like a unique game. It's fun and there are a lot of challanging levels. The gameplay, level design, artwork and soundtrack are all great. I really recommend you this game if you want to have hours of fun."
28012,"Its a very fun game, you can play as very different type of characters with different skills and its very funny to play with friends."
28013,BBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUYYYYYY IT IT IS THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
28014,My review? DOWNLOAD THIS GAME! lol
28015,"Castle crashers is one of the best games i have played,it brings happiness and challenge to my heart.It's like one of those beat em up games,just that it's 10 times better,there are so much pets,weapons,characters you can get you will take a long time"
28016,Great game.
28017,Don't let the cutesy knights fool you. This game's an awesome hack and slash game to play with friends - even better now that it's remastered :D
28018,recommend
28019,wow this game is cool easy to kill the barbarian boss :)
28020,"Very fun, though I wouldn't play it without freinds. It has a quirky sense of humor, with enjoyable beat 'em up action. What  more could you want?

If I had some criticism, I would say the soundtrack, though catchy, could use a few more tracks. Enemies are also re-skinned a lot, but that can be easily forgiven.

"
28021,Forced to play this game for a CS:GO Awp Asiimov. Worth every painfull moment of this shitty game. I r8 5/7
28022,"This is a game filled with magic, poop, and aliens. Why wouldn't you buy this?"
28023,"This game is great, you can really drive yourself in to this game"
28024,"Game is awesome, hours or sarcasm and enjoyment. Worth every penny!"
28025,Awesome
28026,Fuck Me Jerry
28027,"Best multiplayer mini game on Steam !!
Buy this cheap game without hesitation !"
28028,"If you want to play a good Arcade Fighting style game, get this game"
28029,"The best part of Castle Crashers is exploring the world -- there are tons of levels that look and play completely differently. From slip-n-slide icy terrains to sandy deserts, it's clear that every area was crafted with care by the Behemoth's resident artist, Dan Paladin. His unique art style really brings the environments to life, and even the most ferocious monsters are still pretty cute. To counteract the adorableness of Paladin's creations, the game includes lots of potty humor and gore-filled battles.
;D"
28030,Excruciatingly addictive co-playing and hack-slashing fun. Definitely worth the money!
28031,"Nice game, very addicting... Who wants to play insane mode with me industrial castle add me:)"
28032,LOVE IT :D best game :D
28033,you will probally have more fun if you have a friend but this is still fun just on your own
28034,it was a bootyfull game yes i just said that its great to slay the nubs ya
28035,Dank af
28036,okay game
28037,Requires a controller.  Either that or you're forced to use some of the crappiest keyboard controls known to man with no mouse support.
28038,"First played this game on Xbox when I was 9. Then I bought it on PS3 when I was 11.
I had beaten Insane mode on PS3 at lvl 89.
Bought it one year ago.
Still playing today.
10/10"
28039,Multiplayer fun!!!!
28040,"So far im loving this game and im glad i bought it!

There is one bad thing that keeps happening to me and its that when i leave the game after it says its saved and when i go back onto it it has not saved.

I will add to this review when i play more."
28041,super game
28042,a really Good game
28043,Hello blazers NFKRZ here
28044,"Yeah, alright."
28045,"A great game for friends to get together and beat up baddies together with might and magic, a fantastic addition to any Steam library. A modern beat-em-up for fantasy fans, as well as a lot of whacky humor."
28046,Great game to play with a couple of friends and just have some laughs at the silly comedy that is this game! Not much else to say besides wait for this game to go on sale for $0.99 then buy it!
28047,good 10 outta 10
28048,A great Beat 'em up game I have ever played.
28049,"Best Game EVER! Im never get bored of it! And its even better if you have friends to play with!
"
28050,This game is probably one of the best and coolest side scroller arcade games out there all though the price should be lowered a little may 10 dollars instead other wise great game
28051,Very fun gameplay that makes you laugh with many collectables that are hidden along with all the heroes and arenas to beat and even if u have beat all those you still have inane mode
28052,Really nice to play with friends!
28053,"One of the best games I have ever played ,love it so much <3"
28054,"this game is good. I really like it and i would buy it for a friend, but im dirt cheaP
"
28055,Pretty fun. I will admit i haven't learned the optimal strategies for min maxing and the combat associated with that but I beat the game once. I felt no reason to go back though so I would say replay value exists with all the different characters but it isn't different enough for me to go back.
28056,"Get a controller... It's a pain to play without. Otherwise, this game is awesome. Spent many hours on the computer and XBOX playing this game."
28057,"Played with a friend, this game provides many good times and laughs. Enjoyable and sometimes difficult."
28058,Very fun and addicting nothing else like it 10 out of 10 would reccomend
28059,"The sea of ​​positive emotions!  It is especially recommended to go with friends!  And if you are in a bad mood, then this is a game for you, as it will charge you with positive impressions!!"
28060,"very fun, best mmp games ive played

28061,10/10
28062,great fun absolutly love it
28063,"Fun game to play with your friends and pals...
Also you...

you can play this game alone...

Alone..."
28064,"I like this game very much because the multiplayer is very good.
"
28065,Great game!
28066,Lots of fun. A game you can play with your non-gamer girlfriend (she will actually enjoy it)!
28067,"This game is amazing. I recomend it even if its not on sale. I also recomend playing it with friends, that makes it much more enjoyable than it already is, and thats how its best played anyway. Dont let my short playtime on it for Steam fool you, I played the life out of this game in the following years after its 360 release and I even played a decent amount on my friends PS3. Cant wait to do it all again on Steam with the Remastered update.

For those who havent played it I will say its technically repetitive after a few playthroughs with different characters, however, it might be the only repetitive game thats actually fun to replay over and over and over again. Its replayed to unlock characters, characters' abilities, weapons, pets, to level up, to play on the harder difficulty, and just simply because the game is hilarious and fun to play.

10/10 

If it was on Ouya id consider buying an Ouya to do it again.

Consider."
28068,"This game is a lot of fun to play, especially with a group of friends. It does get repetitive when you want to unlock each character, but otherwise it's a solid game."
28069,">Nice Gameplay
>Interactive
>has online and offline multiplayer
>FREE CARDS
>Not pay-to-win

28072,good game of year 2016!
28073,"This game is really fun to play , especially with my younger brother.i recommend this game for almost all kids because of the funny storyline and crazy adventure.Though there is hardly any visible blood,this action packed game brings you to a whole new level."
28074,Tons of fun
28075,"I know this game for sooo long now and played it first on the Xbox 360. I just love it so much, it's got stupid but good humor and a fun gameplay. For whatever reason this game doesn't get boring for me despite the repetitive gameplay. Big thumbs up. Also, Behemoth are just great developers. :)"
28076,Very Fun but no one plays the multiplayer
28077,dont know
28078,"(Read in a childish voice please)
Hey guys, it's BarbarianSlayer500 here bringing you another review on another awful game because i was requested to do this. If you are actually looking for a review for this game, dont read this one. 
So, when i played this game on Game Cube, It was off da hook. It was the best because i played with my brother, Joshie. We had a great time, but i hated it when he compared it to Club Penguin. He said the arrows are like snowballs.
Anyway, I love this game alot, but when i got it on the computer, the game was really hard to adapt to the controls. Do you know what also is really hard...

The final boss. Ha, you expected something else didnt you. Well, I cant say teh game is terrible. Wait, yes i can.

THE GAME IS TERRIBLE!

There, I said it, but hosently the game is good enough for console, just not Steam.
SwordSwinger9000 out!"
28079,Great game and the poop humor makes it one of a kind!
28080,funn
28081,Super Fun Side-Scroller
28082,I encourage your purchase of this game. It has many funny poops in it.
28083,Def another couch co op game thats fun.
28084,Hours of fun
28085,A good coop game to play with your friends :)
28086,Totes mah goats
28087,Very addicting.
28088,Its a really good game but the online mutiplayer comunity is very few people.
28089,Great Couch Coop Game!
28090,nice
28091,This game is really cute with a mix of stupid and super fun playing with friends. I haven't played it by myself because I was gifted it and found its just too funny/fun not to play with other people. You can find and use a bunch of different weapons and pets along the way and some are silly adding to the fun of the game (Ex. a flying whale can become your pet and it poops gold that you can collect on the way). Totally worth getting the 4 game pack and sharing with a few friends you'd like to waste part of your life with on something silly and fun.
28092,"me and my family played this on Xbox, and beat the game in one weekend, and now, I have the Steam version to play with my friends, it's worth buying. the humor, the gameplay, everything about this game makes it fun (except for those darn archers . _.) I rate it 10/10! good buy, and the Local Multiplayer is epic too! :D"
28093,Great game! just make sure you have an xbox controller
28094,"I like farts. I like the green guy. The green guy kinda farts? Therefore I rate this 10/10.

28096,The best co-op%cute game ever
28097,best game :D
28098,"I've always loved this game. Solid replayablity even after having owned it both the pc and xbox for YEARS. The free HD upgrade was a nice touch for those of us who alrady owned it.

If you've been living under a rock for the past 10 years and love run to the right arcade beat em ups, by this game. It's worth the 15 bucks or whatever for the full retail, but seriously if you catch this game on sale it's like 2 bucks. Super fun game with a great sense of humor."
28099,Very fun arcade game!
28100,"It's cool!!
I love this game"
28101,It's great both playing in single mode and in co-op mode. There are many hidden things that make the game more challenge.
28102,"Played the castle crashers mode with a friend.

My build suck, her build is good.
I'm a noob, she's good.
I died, she lived.

10/10 will still play just to annoy friends to revive me over and over again."
28103,Pooping deer 10/10
28104,"fun , addictive & funny"
28105,This game is a classic.
28106,"I got to see a giant bear shit himself, worth my money."

28109,Totaly worth your money!
28110,YUMMY
28111,"Actual game conversation with my friend:

""Jesus, yesterday you were only level 5, and now you're level 28!""
""Yeah, I really got into it last night.""

28117,Awesome! But I Wish There Were A Dog Easter Egg!
28118,Good!
28119,"This is an entertaining but short game.
+ Very humorous.
+ Great diversity of enemies.
+ Memorable boss fights.
+ Levelling system to make you stronger over time.

- Characters must be unlocked through a lot of playthroughs.
- All characters feel the same except for in magic.
- Fights can be very tedious/unfair at times.
- Can quickly beat the game by investing all your points into magic."
28120,YES YES YESY YESYEYSEYSYE
28121,"Easy to learn, good mechanics, great visual style and funny gimmicks. 4 player local co-op is a big plus for me. Suitable for kids 8+ I'd guess."

28123,Very funny game with an excellent humor :-D
28124,Very fun hard game. Recommended at coop for reaaaly big fun. I r8 8/8 m8.

28127,good game.
28128,it's a great game
28129,"I highly reccomend this game you have red knight whwo has lightning attacks blue knight who has ice attacks green knight who can poison enemies and red knight who can burn people. you can get 27 other unlockable characters uncluding hatty from battleblock theater, a bear, and a skeleton.u can put skill points into agility which increases speed and arrow damage stregnth which increases baasic attack damage defense which decreases the damage you take and magic which allowws u to regenerate mana faster use more mana gain more magic damage and even gain up to 4 neww magic attacks for a total of 5. you can get pets like the cardinal which lets u find hidden items rammy u knocks down enemies and bitey who chomps on enemies heads. one pet u can get is the golden whale who comes whith unlockable character Hatty, the golden wwhaale drops golden blocks worth one dollar. there are many fun bosses like a mechanichal ram, a very fat bat, and even a cat who spits furballs at you. this game has 4 player co-op which is very fun and 3 playable modes. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND this games even though i have played only 17 hours i am level 21 as of now and the game is $3.74 on sale and $15 when its not worth the buy either way."

28142,luv it 10/10 would play again
28143,"A side scrolling beat 'em up with RPG elements, just like Guardian Heroes.
This game also has mounts just like Golden Axe.

I didn't expect this game would remind me of my youth.
Thank you Castle Crashers. I cherish this game.

I heard Dragon's Crown is similar with RPG elements and mounts, so
maybe I should check that out too. Thanks to this game, my dead
Sega fanboy inside me is reawakening. I feel young again."
28144,"Really fun little game which will help you fight the boredom of your most boring days. I suggest playing it with friends, it makes the game so much more enjoyable and adds a lot of fun to the party !"
28145,Very good and fun game to play with friends !
28146,It's Awesome
28147,3 words: hilarious as fuck
28148,"Love everything about this game, especially the art style.  Playing with other people is really fun, but the game isn't impossible if you are playing solo.  I would recommend this to pretty much anyone."
28149,the game is so worth it if you have a close friend willing to play with you
28150,owsome
28151,"This game is a really great game! I just love it, 99.9%  percent of the game is a work of art. Wanna know what the excluded 0.1% is? I can't stop playing it.

28177,"good 4 player game for you and friends to get on and play, esay to pick up and fun to play."
28178,"This is a hilarius game, filled with comic violence and enemies."
28179,Funny game. Play it local with my kids. They were cracking up the whole time.
28180,very good recomened to anyone who likes fighting games
28181,"Game got a lot of good reviews back then. I finally got it in a Steam sale to play with a friend of mine over the internet.

Constant FPS drops remained even after we took the ridiculous advice to switch to 800x600 resolution. Can't remap buttons. Annoyingly long unskippable cutscenes with puerile humor.

Gameplay is uninteresting. Hell I'd even call it grindy. You're stuck with the same class the entire campaign as switching to level 1 knights is suicide.
Enemy attacks aren't telegraphed well, felt impossible to avoid. Player combos are very limited.

By the time we got to the Panda village we couldn't make progress anymore. We tried leveling up in earlier levels but it simply wasn't fun.

I tried really hard to keep spirits up. But my friend had absolutely no motivation left.
Now it sits in my library forever unfinished. I played it a few more times, but, well... he's right.
It's kind of a crap game."
28182,"amazing! but boring and hard if you dont have any friends...(dont worry i have)
i realy glad i purchased the game"
28183,So funny !
28184,This game is one of the best couch co-ops.If its on sale-insta-buy and call all your homies for an all-nighter!
28185,Very fun game to play with family and friends
28186,Terrible story.  Goofy Concept.  Bad fart puns (or hilarious depending on your point of view).  A blast to play local co-op on.    My 7 year old nephew loves to play with me.  Works good with online multiplayer too.  This one is great for playing with friends.
28187,"This game was the first video game I ever played. So many good times with this game, hours of laughing with my friends. I know you will love this game. It is very addicting like in the good way. But 10/10!!!!!!"
28188,So fun to play with your friends!
28189,"what do they put in those sandwiches

28201,This game is really fun and you can play at hours at a time 10/10 would play again
28202,10/10 saw Medusa and fell in love.
28203,"This game is so much better then I expected. the only bad thing is that it is hard without a controler(I suck a spelling)

Other than that this game is AWSOME!!!!!"
28204,"Such an amazing game even after all these years. It's probably the most fun 2D sidescrolling beat 'em up you can get. It's an older game but it's fun factor is still through the roof with a few different ways to play whichever character you want.

If you have friends looking for a co op game, get this one. There's no reason for a group of friends who enjoy co op games to not have played this one by now or at least have seen it and thought about getting it. It goes on sale pretty often too, so if the $15 price tag is to high, at least pick it up when it's on sale."
28205,"Probably the most fun side scroller and best co-op game I've ever played. Just get it, you won't regret it. Controller essential. Most negative reviews are from people trying to play on keys which would ruin the experience."
28206,this is one of my favourite games so far i've played it on xbox and now on pc with this update it has gotten even better
28207,"raced my friends with a poop propelled deer 
10/10"

28212,This game is just awsome!
28213,"this game is awsome everybody shod play it
"
28214,"I mean...

It's CASTLE CRASHERS.

It's the game we all spent hours on as kids, the one we gathered at a friend's house to play, the game we always started from the beginning because we didn't know what ""saving"" and ""loading"" meant. 


Okay fine it's an excellent, absurdly funny game that's even better with coop. Buy it."
28215,"Buys game
starts game
spams w the whole game
beats game


11/10 would break w again"
28216,its a fun game
28217,Great game to play with friends. Challenging and fun.
28218,Fun
28219,"If you like ridiculously fun games, and playing those kinds of games with friends, this game is for you."
28220,good
28221,"Really fun to play with friends 
But can also be fun on your own.

Love the music and random referances."
28222,"Still great after all these years, especially with the new textures and fps."
28223,Deus vult
28224,Funny side-scroller.
28225,too good
28226,it is very good
28227,"Two words:

Fucking catshark."
28228,"I enjoyed this game a lot. I really liked the aspect of being able to invite your friends and have a good time. This is a game to play with friends for hours as I have. The Arena is fun, and so is the levels."
28229,The game is one of the best I've ever played I highly recomend it 10/10 would waste winter break on game again
28230,Silly humor co-op hack 'n slash? Sold.
28231,"Sadly i cannot recommend this game simply why:

You hit things....and hit things.....and hit things and so on get items level up fight bosses and yea kinda gets boring Buy battleblock theater instead That is very fun with a friend"
28232,"Fun in multiplayer, but i found the story a bit flat"
28233,Battleblock and Castle Crashers Gives You Good Deal
28234,A fun hack and slash to play with friends.
28235,I remember playing this game on the Xbox 360 when it came out. I absolutely LOVE this game and it's features and reccomend it to anyone who want a good experience or wants to play with their friends.
28236,I purchased the four pack for my friends and I and its such a great buy. Castle Crashers is a very fun game with freinds and will make you cry out in laughter.
28237,sorry about the hate this is great i beat this game SOLO and its pretty easy i only got 3 fails in volleyBall and i won after the third fail
28238,"Incredible game with great multiplayer 8/10
Bad thing is that it lags during multiplayer"
28239,This is one of the best games I`ve  ever played. It has such simple combos and attack patterns that it leaves so much room to make up your style. $15 is such a little investment compared to how much fun you`ll have playing this game. There are over 20 characters to play as not to mention the DLC. So If you want a fun and amaing multiplayer game than this is the game for you.
28240,"its pretty neat
"
28241,good couch game
28242,"it's a great beat'm up game with great combat, cool enemies, some of the best music in any game i've seen by far, cool weapons, and fun levels (except for the volleyball part). I'd give it a 9.5/10."
28243,This is very good game to play with your friends.
28244,Brothers in arms... at least until a kiss comes into the picture.
28245,"This runs great at about 60fps on intel hd integrated graphics on my basic laptop.

intel/10 would play again"
28246,I find it to be  a fun game you can play with friends or on your own. I give it a 8.5 on a scale of 10.
28247,"chopped off my friends' heads to kiss a princess.

10/10 would decapitate again"
28248,Just buy it already
28249,"This very fun, creative, violent, hilarious game is a great game to play with your friends. There are over 50+ quests to do with many unique characters! And, if you get tired of beating the crap out of everbody in just about 5 seconds, then you can switch over to Insane Mode. But, you have to be at least level 30+. There are three different gamemodes, such as: The Original Story Mode, Back off Barbarian, and The Bloody Arena! Also it works on Xbox 360, and the Playstation 3. But overall, this great game is a wonderful way to pass time.



5 Star Rating"
28250,Fu*kin amazing .... AWSOME PETS
28251,"This game is really fun, it reminds me of the old Ninja Turtles games."
28252,This game is a lot of fun. My 2 year old and I like to sit at the computer an play. she gets excited when i chop the enemies with the sword.  Seriously though I think this game has great replay value for me and I love how well it plays with the Xbox 360 controller.
28253,   good
28254,"It is very difficult without a contoller.  If you have a controller, It will be alot more fun"
28255,its like 2d but also 3d and i love it. its super fun to play with friends
28256,Excellent
28257,Great game! There is lots of replayablity especially with all the unique characters! However i do wish we got the DLC that Xbox had gotten. Would love to be able to play as the necromancer.
28258,"I liked BTT but this is just too much.
For some weird reason, I got bored of it.
Now it seems annoying.
No idea why I traded 2 CSGO keys for this game.
GG.
"
28259,"It's an rpg ... but mediocre. I have no idea why this has so many thumbs up but its quite lame in general. The only stat worth leveling up seems like damage. There are only a couple of magics and, for an rpg, quite little variation. It's not a bad game... just meh. imo stay clear."
28260,Love this game so so much i think it's awsome and fun!
28261,"Yep, its a great game."
28262,"I think this is easily one of the best arcade game of all times. It's simple, yet requires a lot of time to be mastered. Tons of charactes, secrets weapons and stuff will keep you playing its campaign more than once. If ihis game is funny alone, multiply it by up to 4 when it comes to multiplayer, be it local or over internet. It has also got some funny minigames that contribute to lenghten this masterpiece's life. It's actually hard to find a flaw in this game. Highly recommended to both casual and hardcore gamers."
28263,"this game is sure fun to play and unlock so many characters and so on, but one problem this game is such like waiting simulant on online. tehy better fix it soon. bring your friends and play castle crashers NOW! :D"
28264,Good game. Overpriced. Buy on sale. Merica.
28265,Fun To play with friends
28266,Very great game!!
28267,Very bra spel! 10/10 rating!
28268,Yes. Poop. Buy it. Pooping deer. Pooping bears. Pooping owls. 10/10 IGN
28269,alot of fun when played with friends!!
28270,"im hatty
"
28271,so good
28272,it's decent
28273,"so damn fun to play you and 3 friends. 100% recommended, worth its price"
28274,"This game is really awesome, it brings what a videogame needs Intesity,challenge and etertainment. I really recommend this game to gamers who enjoy coming together with their friends and having adventures with them especially with all the different characters you can get!! Awesome Game"
28275,I like turtles.
28276,This is one of the greatest games ever made and it defined my childhood i heavily recommend buying this game !
28277,"It reminds me of the classic arcade games we used to play with my friends back in the day as Knights of the Round, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, The Punisher, Double Dragon, Dungeons & Dragons, Metal Slug etc. The gameplay is similar, the feeling while you playing is similar. Colourful, cartoonish environment, interesting and funny combos, weapons, enemies, bosses, power ups and mini games and many hours of fun with your mates. All these with 2,99 € only! I love this game and you will love it too no matter what!!!! :D"
28278,Meh it gets boring and repetitive after awhile
28279,"There is a Pooping Bat. Its the Cave Boss. I love it.

10/10 Would Poop again"
28280,Great game to play with freinds
28281,"I love this game, the coop is great."
28282,"Played an absolute crap ton of this game on Xbox, got most characters nearly maxed out with my siblings. Pretty fun alone, but tons of fun with others. Soundtrack is a bop

11/10"
28283,So you crash some castles and its up to 4 player so possible Party Game! Not terribly fun solo but can get silly with more. 8/10
28284,"Aerial Combos.

10/10"
28285,Had fun while everyone actually felt like playing it.
28286,Loved the game but needs more people to play multiplayer ;-;
28287,F***ing infinite Air Combos FTW!
28288,"Stupid, stupid, stupid fun. I can't think of any other way to describe it. Grab a few friends and go kill everything ever."
28289,"One of the best and longest lasting Indie games out there. This game is worth full price, but comes on sale regularly."
28290,Gr8 played a cracked version
28291,really fun game that has lots of action etc I really like this game
28292,"its cool but i cant play it because... it dosnt work, every time i try loading it,boom,i come here. i tryd 20 times still nothing
"
28293,"Game play seems alright but what bothers me is bosses -can- and -will- stun lock, making it impossible to play singleplayer you, and pretty much -anything- can block your vision. I would give it kudos for player customsation though this is useless if you can't find a game to join or friends to play with you due to boss being over powered thanks to game devs. And why is it that every thing farts itself to death? Farts aren't funny unless you have the mind of an 8 year old."
28294,"good

28295,"Really fun, I prefer to play with friends.  I remember playing this on XBOX 360 all day with my brother.  BEST GAME!"
28296,"First off, this game was a complete throwback to when I originally bought it on the 360 forever ago. So this was so great when I saw it on steam and it happened to be on sale, practically a steal. But, when I went on to play with some friends it worked until we actually got into some action, then from there on out it was a shit show and we couldn't play at all. What it would end up doing is we would get in the level we wanted to, for about a good 30 seconds before it said ""All players have left and the game session is no longer available"". We did every tip and trick there was in the book but it kept on doing this so I am very disappointed in the fact that I am not able to play with some of my good buddies. That's exactly what this game is, a fun enjoyment with your friends. THERE IS BASICALLY NO POINT IN PLAYING. If this issue is fixed, that would be a VERY big convenience. I still recommend this game but IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED ASAP."
28297,"BEST GAME EVER, NEEDS TO BE A NEW ONE
"
28298,itz a dum gam too pley with frendz cuz i hav non
28299,"A great game with many hours of entertainment inside of it. A large collection of weapons, alot of characters, and the bosses are fun aswell. A game I suggest as it barely ever lags and is extremely fun with friends.

Now for the cons. Sadly, its pretty hard to play with random people online considering not many people play arena or multiplayer.  You are basically forced to have friends who play the game in order to just SEE was multiplayer is like."
28300,This game is legendary!
28301,"the thieves look like buttholes 

10/10 would steal again C;
              -felix eisenhower 2015"
28302,"It's a fun game to play with your friends.
Choose your own character to level up and defeat every stage."
28303,"8/4

pros:
has a pooping deer
sword that looks like a branch
imposible levels that r hard

cons:
no shreK
NEEDS a fedora 
kant quickscope"
28304,Amazing game this was the first game I ever played. I recommend playing with a controller if you're bad with a keyboard or you can change controls. Great humor and funny jokes. 10/10 would deer shart again.
28305,"I love this game only one thing i wish i could add like, how much xp im gaining like xp numbers, and health bars.
"
28306,"A lot of fun, the best when playing multiplayer!"
28307,"I played as a Blue Knight magic build.

Need to add some more skills. Great game though."
28308,"Great game.
"
28309,"Honestly, I could sit back for hours smashing my A, B, X, Y, and other buttons playing this without getting bored! All the gruel head chopping! Phenominal! If you don't have this, you havn't played a beat 'em up...(well you might have but not one this fun and cool!)"
28310,"Excellent game, very well designed."
28311,Best game ever!!! Love the gameplay and LOVE the sountrack its lit af
28312,"It's tons of fun, especially when you play with others!! Works better if you have a controller, but I played through the whole thing with my keyboard and mouse just fine."
28313,"Multiplayer is dead, and it's not that fun in single player."
28314,One of the best local co-op games I have ever played with excellent humour included throughout.  Highly recommended!
28315,I reccomend this for anyone who wants a game with some serious difficulty (BIT LATER IN GAME) and who wants to play with friends.
28316,Almost all of my 100+ hours was spent on the Xbox 360 version a long time ago but I can definetly say the steam version is very fun to play with friends!
28317,Amazing game
28318,"I lost friend palying this game
10/10"
28319,"Multiplayer still have bugs like when my friend died, on his screen i was fighting nothing but on  my screen i was fighting monsters. But if someone doesn't die, its all good."
28320,"920/1000

in 3 words, simple but great.

castle crashers is a VERY GOOD game, the COOP works fine, the combat is fluid, the graphics are SIMPLE and they allow you to play on any computer. I can't stop myself from playing this game, its meant to be played more than once. The story is short, FUNNY and very simple, it takes between 5 and 9 hours to finishs so if you get addicted you can go trough the game a dozen times just to unlock everything. at this point, i have played for 24 hours and have unlocked less than half the characters and still need to find some of the weapons. The fact that this game is made for coop, makes it even more fun, when you play with your friends (or even strangers), it makes this 2008 game just like a new one, its a lot more fun.

for those who like it hard it even brings an ""insane"" mode to the table.

if there is any downside, it's that it gets repetitive the second time around.

pros

-great replay value
-great coop
-simple, funny and enjoyable story
-fluid combat
-lovely graphics
-you can play this game years later and its still fresh.

cons

-repetitive (the second time and after only)
-no depth to the story and world (but who cares, it's fun anyway)

28321,Dis is guud
28322,Fun for an hour.
28323,"high WTFness 

11/10"
28324,"Great, classic game. I remember spending countless hours and nights, staying up with friends and family, playing this hit-'em-up game on my Xbox 360. The Steam version (now remastered) is great. Beautiful framerate with silky smooth visuals. I have always been a huge fan of this developer's art style. 

Unfortunately, I am always facing connectivity issues when playing online in a group, so I may end up confined to playing offline, until some fixes are applied (if they ever will be). 

Good to see the developer is still keeping this game up-to-date."
28325,10/10
28326,1/10 ign not enuf crashing
28327,fun game yo pick up in sales
28328,"Had to kill my friends in order to make out with a princess.

10/10 would kill friends again"
28329,"Get 3 other bros
Have a night free
play one of the best one night games ever.

Good single player playthrough (potions are harder to use)
Would recommend 3 or 4 players for the most fund

XBOX 360 Controller is a must.
Can all play on the same game if you have enough USB ports (I have 3, so I can play 3 players with one game copy)"
28330,"A game that can be played with all your friends and alone, Castle Crashers is one of my favorite games that I keep coming back to."
28331,"Finally a game where you can play with 4 friends on Steam, but with more exciting action."
28332,"Very nice made game. Fun music, nice art style simple dialogs nice fights and cmbat system and 4 player local."
28333,u dont actually crash into castles
28334,hahaha saya suka art style nya :D
28335,YUSSS
28336,"A great game to play with others, but for me at least, it gets boring after a while. And as much as I want to keep on completeing the game with multiple characters to unlock more characters, I just don't have that time.

Still fun though."
28337,"Great game, But online does not work well, its almosst  impossible to have a server with more then 2 players"
28338,ahaaa now i can play this with my brother and my family
28339,"Castle Crashers is a completionist's dream: you unlock characters as you play through the game with the ones you start with, and playing through with these unlocked characters grants you even MORE characters, and so forth and so on.  There are even crossovers into Behemoth's other games, most notably Battleblock Theater.  There are also weapons and pets to locate throughout each of the maps, and getting a few of them can be quite a challenge.  The soundtrack is also quite catchy; I find myself humming tunes from it throughout the day.

Playing with friends is ideal, but it is possible to play the game solo.  Consider getting a pack that offers multiple copies"
28340,Awesome RPG to play with Friends!
28341,Epic game i can't stop playing it if you love this game I'll recommend battleblock theater it's also a pretty awesome game
28342, More playble lvls pack !!!!!!
28343,shit game
28344,Knights everywhere!
28345,10/10 I would fight my fellow knights again
28346,"AMAZING GAME I LOVE IT and thanks for making it 75 percent off (when i bought it) and it is worth it i love this game and its funny that on one of the levels or map levels the song called jumper is in it and i know that from Geometry Dash
"
28347,"The classic side style game where you spam buttons and kill people.

Reminds me of like Dad N Me

SUPERFUN WITH FRIENDS"
28348,good fun!
28349,This is damn amazing!
28350,"Umm. I really like the game but no one plays it anymore :c 

I'm sad, but great job m8's :D"
28351,So Beautiful and funny game <3
28352,Played this on xbox 360 and ps3. Great game. I went on newgrounds when I was younger

28355,"this game is just plain good 
"
28356,"U can drop golden poop on enemies

10/10 would poop again"
28357,"ya its fun but the keyboard default controls suck you literaly have to change them , other than that its a pretty fun game solo and a amazing game multiplayer but one bad thing is arena to get some characters you need to go through like 20 stages of an areana with like one or two more enemies each round and theres no wave conter so u pretty much guess and when your right at the end you get trapped in a corner and killed in less then 5 sec. But other then that one problem its a amazing game but id reccemend getting on sale unless you really like side scroller beat um uo so to say 

id rate 9.1/10.5"
28358,You will have your weirdest best time ever.
28359,PETA would not approve 2/10
28360,good game
28361,Add me if you want to play together!! Its a great game but hard to get multiplayer games going...
28362,nice game
28363,it was awsome
28364,"It contains a deer taking a crap.

10/10"
28365,"Still very fun and addictive, can't stop!!"
28366,10/10 would smash again
28367,"This is honestly one of the best co-op games I have ever played. It is chalenging and fun, perfectly balanced with humour and cute graphics."
28368,Amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing! Ive Played Castle Crashers Before On My Friends XBox 360 I Loved It! And Wished I Could Get It! Then I Saw It On Steam :D I Was So Exited To Get It! I Didnt Have Any Money Though... So I Added It To My Wishlist And Then A Few Months Later It Was Secret Santa At my School The Person Who Got Me Gave Me A 20 Dollar Steam Gift Card! And The Second The Steam Winter Sale Started I Rushed To The Store To Get It! Got The Portal Bundle For Only 5 Bucks! And Castle Crashers For Me And My Friend And We Played It That Night! So Yes I Do Reccomend This Game BUT! Wait For A sale This Game Is A Bit Pricey! But Other Then That Perfect! 5 Stars! :)
28369,"Super fun to play with friends! If you don't own this game, shame on you ;)
There's a small amount of that gaming feel I used to have when playing NES
games... That's something really awesome"
28370,Fun indie game to play with friends. It has good mini games to add on to the fun. Really cool theme  and a 8/8  from me.
28371," The game is quite good if you are only going to play it in one computer, whether it is on your own or with your friends but everyone playing in the same computer, because when you try to play online game there is a massive lag that makes impossible to play. It has been an on going issue for longer than a year and they haven´t been able to resolve or release any patch for it. I find it shocking and outrageous that knowing the issues the game has been having for online playing and the high amount of orders they haven´t deigned to resolve it.
"
28372,"10/10
Too bad no one really plays it"
28373,This game completes me. 'Nuff said.
28374,"Just bought this game, havn't played yet but i did in the past with some friends on console quite excellent, very entertaning and lots of laugh. It's best to play it with someone, overall, I would recommend you to buy this game under sales only. Enjoy !"
28375,Donald Trump Approves
28376,Awesome game I love it! But please make more dlc characters because the blacksmith and the pink knight are already creative but imagine what the behemoth can make for dlcs! Any dlc character or map or minigame Ill buy! (If its under 5 dollars) In rating Ill say this game would be 11/10 IGA rating.
28377,"Very fun to play with friends. I would not recommend to buy it if you don't have a friend to play with. If your playing with friends use controllers its easier. This game is one of a kind and is really fun with friends,brothers,or sisters."
28378,Mindless fun at it's very best!
28379,"Arena mode is bullshit.
10/10 would ragequit again."
28380,Who doesn't enjoy Castle Crashers??? 10/10
28381,"Great, fun, and very funny!"
28382,Its a really fun game with so many secrets I can find the real declaration of independence with it.
28383,"SUPER FUN, and a great game to play with friends... if ony there were more games like this. (excluding Battle Block Theater)"
28384,"I have this on xbox360 already and now it's back, even better then before! With dlc characters from before now being unlockable in the base game, except for the pink knight and blacksmith. I just got it and I'll probably quadruple the amount of hours on this game if not more, by playing with friends and/or going solo, trying to unlock all the characters, trying to find all the animal orbs and weapons. This game is outstading! Buy it now!"
28385,Best Party game to have for four or less people
28386,This Game Is AMASING 10/10 Would Play Again
28387,ALL THE DANK MEMES!!!!!!!
28388,this game is like mine the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
28389,the story is good. I just dont like how you need to beat the game soooooooo many times to unlock new characters
28390,"A great classic by the gods themselfs.

Very fun game."
28391,"I absolutly LOVE Castle Crashers, been playing it since it came out on the Xbox 360 a good few years ago, recently purchased on steam and still holds up as one of the most entertaining games EVER!!!!.

A great thing about it is my 5 year old Daughter can easily pick up the controller and play it, and boy does she love playing it, you should hear her shouting with laughter,

if you are looking at it and thinking is it worth it? HELL YES, this is a game I give my ever refered 10/10, anyone who knows my reviews knows that I never give 10/10, the comical stylings of newgrounds is phenomenal.

Do not delay any longer, get this game now, you will not be disapointed."
28392,"I really like this game, in this game graphics dont matter. Gameplay is the main thing what the developers had in mind and I certainly feel it worked."
28393,"If you don't have controller, you are kind of screwed.  Are the controls are set by default to an xbox controller, so taking your time to re-key map all the controls is tedious. 

However, once that done its fun to play.

PS: I have actually played more hours, but for some reason steam didn't count them."
28394,"Classic game. If you are reading this review, you probably should just buy it."
28395,"I couldn't stop laughing the entire time I was playing this, snickering over every little cutscene and mucked it up hilariously with my pals. Great game, quality multiplayer shenanigans, definitely would recommend"
28396,"Super duper funny, clever, and just an experience you'll never forget. Play alone for a good time, or play with friends for a great time."
28397,"its awesome
"
28398,i thiought castle acrashers was goocdl but it atfutlyy has suck graphicsz
28399,I recomend some of their other games (i still like this one the most).
28400,"Started first mission with my friend , died a 1000 times , this game is easy 11/10"
28401,Best game ever. She are perfect for gameplay with friends. That game are rly good
28402,How to add a friend on steam?
28403,"I would rate this game a solid 9/10
The levels and characters are beyond fun and are funny to watch in combat, the boses always make me laugh, and honestly I play this game both on the PC and the Xbox and I never get tired of it! The ONLY thing i dont really like about this game was the newer mini game that replaced all you can quaff, its a little irratating every now and then when your character goes a different way than the way you wanted it to go."
28404,dog shit
28405,Killed my friend in arena...he is no longer my friend 10/10 whould lose a shitty friend again!
28406,"Seriously? Castle Crasher belongs on your MUST PLAY list, on any platform. Bonkers  Side Scrolling Beatem (And slash'em) up, with epic multiplayer that works like a charm."
28407,"SEXY AF!
"
28408,probably one of my favorite games on steam and also a classic for xbox 360 and xbox one
28409,"An amazing 2D sidescroller with over 30 playable characters, lots of weapons, lots of pets, an amazing OST, magic and easy controls. It is also 4 player local and online."
28410,"Great 2-D Game.

But it only takes 1-7 days to win the game.

I won the game in 1 day whit one gamer from my familey.

Its pretty fun, speciely when you get animals as partners!"
28411,Just because this game is more fun with multiplayer doesn't mean it isn't fun on its own.
28412,It's fun
28413,i love this game i like the level of insanity and deviousness in it i love the art and i would recommend 12/10
28414,IT IS ASOME!
28415,Yes
28416,Excellent game to play with family. Visually fun and full of humor. Lots to unlock and play in unique way.
28417,You still dont own castle crashers?
28418,"Gr8 m8 i r8 8/8 on a pl8 with no h8 
 
    With that said its a really fun game to play with friends and the developers know how to satisfy their customers :3"
28419,"Looking for a cool beat'n'up with LOTS of characters and humor? Buy it

Pros:
- LOTS of characters, each one with special powers
- Fun
- Cool bosses
- The map is big and have a cool variety of places
- Multiplayer
- Good to play with friends

Cons:
- The map is big (in first playthrough, it isn't a problem, but in a second, is tiresome)
- To free roam in the map with each character, you have to finish the game with the desired character
- Feel people online"
28420,"It's fun. I played it solo. Played with some of my friends for 20 minutes. If you liked golden axe, you will like this too. Funny, a little bit monotone, some easy time spent well game."
28421,it very good man
28422,"could use more poop jokes
5/5"
28423,"I think this game bring my friend and me lots of fun. As all of my friendz know, I was a achievements collector, after we finish the whole story, I tried to collect all of achivements. Once, I played CRASHERS in the offline mode and I lose all of my achivements, such a sad story LOL."
28424,"Again, good job Behemoth.
10/10"
28425,"A fun cartoon RPG, even to this time!"
28426,"played with 3 of my friends.. online seems fine, with a bit of lag but it's fine. Beware not to lose your friendship at the end of the round~! hahah"

28432,"It's good, buy it"
28433,👍
28434,10/10
28435,This game is a classic. Its the modern equivlant of double dragon. Its a short journey but a blast to play with friends so i would recomend not playing alone. Its humor is very immature but not over the top which is a good thing i found myself gigling like a 10 year old boy. Multiple playable characters so you might have incentive to replay. Oh and you ride a deer propelled by feces whats not to love
28436,its so fun but i wish i could bring the data from consol to pc
28437,"One of the most amazing games I have ever played! I played it on the xbox when my older brother came to visit but he never brings his xbox anymore. So I got it on steam and it is still amazing!

28484,"The campaign is great. I played all the way through with a couple of friends, and it was amazing. We found the best weapons, and unlocked all of our skills just by playing the story. Then we beat the game. We stopped playing after that. It has a fun campaign, but is pointless after that. You can replay levels, and thats about it. 7/10 overall"

- Same plot
- Get this game on sale..

If new adventures were added to this game + harder places to beat, this game would improve and gain more people buying it. Overall, this game is really fun and worth $15.00. I would recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have an extra game to play and only plays about two or three games. This game has nice challanges and achievements that you can unlock and it's great for parties.

I rate Castle Crashers: [b]4.7/5[/b]"
28486,"best game ever hey if the creators of the game see this then pls make it so that brute is easy to get so u dont have to beat the game with a hole bunch of cheracters
"
28487,"it's a very good game
"
28488,"If you don't have friends, don't play this game. 

Otherwise, this is such a good game. Extremely fun and can be somewhat competitive (against your friends) at times.
The replay ability is great and there are many weapons/pets to collect. Try to get all the characters once you finish!

8.5/10 with friends

28495,"this game is awsome XD
"
28496,"Okay, beforehand, this game is great. With all the immature jokes and cartoony drawings and characters, it's pretty fun for all ages. Before the update, I'd say that the game is laggy and has performance issues, but now it runs really smoothly. The new menus are spot-on, and they fixed the issues that came with the port(showing XBOX controls rather than PC/Mac). The only problem I have is that All You Can Quaff was removed.

9.9/10"

28502,"This game is just pure enjoyment and amazing ""what the fluff"" moments. It is a very fun and entertaining game that is best when played with friends to mess around with or to get achievements on. Not all of them are easy to get but takes time and luck. Just an amazing game that i had on the xbox 360 and bought it here as soon as i found it."
28503,"LOVE IT, GOTTA' LOVE IT, YOU CAN'T WITHOUT LOVING THIS, ON BEGGINING IS SUPER RAGE, LATER, SO EASY AND AWESOME!(i done the game ;) )"

28515,Amazing! This has become one of my favoite games! Its so much fun!
28516,"(+)Funny expresion..
(+)Good Story but not really that good..
(+)More fun if you play with your friend..

(-) Exp and gold not shareable if you play online.
(-) Hard to see your character in crowd.

but still good to play with your friends."
28517,This game has set the standard for beat-em-ups and is what I compare ALL beat-em-ups (past and present) to.  Please buy this.  Local multiplayer is also top notch.
28518,This game is good.
28519,yes
28520,"nothing more remarkable than seeing a flying cute bambi go to infinite and beyond using the power of diarrhea

Castle crashers its a beat em up + RPG that focus in co op and weird moments, alongside with a good OST, collectibles ,and background that are beyond simple and beautifull.
the game itself its 100% fun alone, just imagine if u got to play it with 4 of your friends :D (bTw as others coop, this game become harder if there are more players in the adventure)"
28521,Fantastic!
28522,"[h1] [b]Castle Crashers[/b] is some “Old School Arcade Fun”.[/h1]

I was on the fence about this one because of the art style, and it looked like a kids game. I ended up picking it up on a Steam sale for my son, who wanted it. To my surprise this game is a blast. You pick one of four knights each with a special ability. Fire, Poison, Electricity, Ice, you get the idea. The powers give you a special attack that does significant damage, as well as decides the color of your knight. The game supports full controller, local co-op, online co-op, and local plus online co-op. This is the way it should be. Local co-op, and split screen belong on PC! The game features three modes, campaign, versus, and a jumping mini game (not my cup of tea, but some may like jumping). The campaign mode is where it's at. You, and up to three friends button mash your way to victory against the evil horde to save the princesses. The combat gives you some options aside from hack n slash, like your special power, bow, bomb, and a few simple combos. The music is great, they did a nice job on the tracks for this game. The monster design is comical, and slicing the heads off little minions is fun.  The game will run on almost any PC (Not your Commodore 64, but anything from 2010 and up should be fine). If you've been passing on this one, give it a try at the next sale.

28523,is fun
28524,AWESOME!!!!!!!!
28525,"Castle is a hilariously funny game to play with your friends, especially in a 4-player coop. II seriously recommend if you want a good laugh!"
28526,"Funny and fun to play with friends...
Love the giant cat!!!"
28527,Super fun and funny. A MUST HAVE.
28528,I like dick
28529,I very much recommend Castle Crashers BUT i recommend changing the controls to wasd and left and right mouse for attack.
28530,"Great and very fun game that is worth buying
"
28531,Fun Beat Em up
28532,super fun game! Really hard to play without a controller
28533,Quickest way to ruin a friendship.
28534,"Get to lvl 22

Messes up and clicks reset lvl

10/10 Would reset again"
28535,"This is an amazing game, and the best 2D game that I have ever played. It's a great experience to play it alone, and and its just as fun to play with friends. There is a fair amount of content in the campaign, and even after that it has a very good replay value, as you unlock new characters (with a new set of abilities) when you beat the game with a certain character.
 The minigame does'nt have much to offer; at least if you play it alone (as i did). There is also plenty of poop jokes, so if you are easily offended by that kind of humor, this game may not be for you. Otherwise, everyone should try this game.
The gameplay is awesome, the story is hilarious, and the artstyle is memorable. I give this game a solid 8/10."
28536,"An awesome piece of art, fun, blood, battle, laughs... did I forgot to mention FUN?!"
28537,"And I thought Im gonna stay virgin knight forever.

69/10 would beat the $hit out of my friends to get princess booty again."
28538,Hoes before bros
28539,"IM FINALLY GOT THIS GAME 

AND I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!!!"
28540,It would've been nice to know the game is virtually unplayable on a PC keyboard before I bought this.  After 3 minutes of absolute frustration I exited the game and have no plans to play again until I get a controller.
28541,"Nice game, it's make me addicted"
28542,"been playing since it was released on live, great game! and controller support is perfecto"
28543,"Recommend to play local or multiplayers
+ funny musics xD
+ funny characters dance 
+ Wierd enemies
+ Good advantures game
+ Juggling for lvl up 

12/10 for this game :ccknight:"
28544,"Back in the days of making friends solely to play on their XBox, Castle Crashers was the go-to party game.  I may not have a lot of hours on record with this digital edition, but oh have I played this game on console until the poor machine was begging for something new to chug through its Vcard.  Castle Crashers is a 2.5D hack and slash game with surprisingly easy to learn mechanics, fun boss fights, hilarious art, and comedic music.  The plot is simple: you're a night at a good old castle party when goblins attack, princesses and a gem get carted off, and now you and your drunk knightly rocker buddies are off to save the Kingdom, the treasure, and get those girls.  Hint: eat the sandwich."
28545,"Had lots o fun
Best Game 1973.
I rate ( 7/26 )
"
28546,"Great game




"
28547,"1:21 am, dont know where i am, please send help
10/10"
28548,"This game is the best hands down, i played it a bunch on 360 and now im playing it again on PC."
28549,AWESOME GAME TO PLAY WIYH FRIENDS  A+
28550,"amazing game, I definitly recomend this game for anyone who wants to play a fun game that will keep you coming back. I love playing this with my friends!"
28551,"A really fun co-op side-scroller game. My wife loves playing it with me, and in fact the game is more enjoyable multiplayer, versus singleplayer. Has deep replay value due to all the different playable characters. Well worth the $10!"
28552,Very Good Game. 10/10.
28553,"yeah!!!!!This game is awesome if you like funny 4-player co-op this is the game for you!!!!!! I played first on the xbox 360 when I was a little kid,then it came to steam and someone gifted it to me and I made one friend online because we were stuck on a part and we beat to togeather,but I am going to pencile in a ""HELL yes"" for recommendaiton"
28554,"All of these are rated on a scale of 1-10, 10 being best and 1 being worst.
Game play: 10/10 Epic fun hack and slash gameplay.
Graphics: 10/10 The artistic style in this game is amazing. So beautiful.
Story: 8/10 Just your average save the princess stuff.
Multiplayer Experience: 10/10 Whether you're playing local or online this game's multiplayer is epic. Not complicated, just hack and slash with your buddies.
Single player Experience: 9/10 Literally multiplayer but it's more fun with friends.
Overall (Average): 9.4 Great game. I extremely reccomend it.
"
28555,"This is an amazing beat em up with short and sweet cutscenes that give you a satisfying amount of context as to what is happening. The combat is engaging, difficult but forgiving, and occasionally; hilarious. The level system is nerfed compared to other games in a way that really makes you define how you need to fight from the begining. It has enough content to get me stuck on it for hours on end. At the time I'm righting this I've had the games for little over 5 days and already have over 25 hours on it. It's hopelessly addicting. The boss fights are engaging and difficult; but not too difficult. There are plenty of unlocks to get and you can't just do it willy-nilly. Sometimes there are moments when I feel like I just got cheap shot when I die, but there is always a way around those. Another small problem is if you don't go melee you will never get the princess in multiplayer, which in my eyes is a little unfair. Other wise; it's gr8 m8 I r8 8/8"
28556,"Fantastic game if you have 1-3 friends to share it with. Alone it isn't that fun. And I really love the music in this game. Brainless fun when you don't want to overthink things, but still want to have a good time."
28557,Really cool and Fun game it is for all ages just turn off gore. Everything about the game is great the multiplayer aspect the mini games and the DLC which only cost $1 each. They all my this one of the funnest games Ive ever played and I recommend that everyone with $10 should get this game.
28558,Let alone is it on  discount its worth the full price its lots of fun for casual and hardcore players theres alot of things to do in this game and its very addactive it also has a very cool art style and doesnt cost much to run witch always helps! :)
28559,"Awesome little game! I don't think I have any complaints... If anything, it's too short of a game. This could have gone on forever!"
28560,Weed.
28561,"awesome game. Thats all I have to say, needs much more skill then I expected"
28562,very good game
28563,yes
28564,this game is the best a game you can come back to all the time
28565,"Gr8 game! I always have so much fun playing. Love the music! Not too easy to play, but not hard either. Characters are cute and nice storyline. I recommend! 9.5/10"
28566,"This is a really fun game to play! You can do it all by yourself or you can play with friends, let them die and then kiss all the princesses, ahah! Really great graphics and overall design. I highly recommend it if you want to relax and have fun playing a nice adventure beat-em up game!"
28567,"This is an amazing game! Got it 2 days ago, and have already played way too much. Playing with friends is an amazing experience, and has a lot of fun packed into it :D"
28568,This game is one of my all time favorites after playing it for 2 hours!!!!!!!!
28569,"If u like smashing,slicing,killing baddies this is the game for u good spoof jokes. Also has great magic ablities and Characters"
28570,good
28571,This game can only be played during real nigga hours
28572,"Best game to play with friends, get it."
28573,Simple yet extremely entertaining for all ages. This is a great game to button mash through and a good way to share a lot of laughs with friends through the entire story.
28574,I Remember Back When I Was Around 12 Years Old That My Cousin Introduced A Game Called Castle Crashers To Me. About 2 Years Later I Bought A Computer And Saw This Game On Sale! So Of Course I Bought it! And Lets Just Say I Had A Little Too Much Fun
28575,"why wont it open any more?
"
28576,"Castle Crashers is a really fun and hularious game to play and i recommend people who haven't play it should buy it! :D
"
28577,i got this game on xbox and it was very fun so when i saw it was on sale i bought it again. Very fun to play with friends. Not too difficult and not too easy with many different characters and levels to play on. Much Recomend
28578,This really a great game :) i really addicted to it :x
28579,This is a great game.
28580,This is a very good co-op game that requires teamwork and friends. I didnt regret the decision of buying this because theres so much things to do in this game
28581,"I would not recommend this game, because... if you see a level 99 chances are he hacked it. it's hard to find somebody to play with inless you really search and add random people because the online is practicly dead the campaign is pretty boring and there isn't much to do in-game oh and also the game is dead. nobody plays anymore i mean i see it on sale for ""$4.24"" 
november 29th 2015, so i would say its worth it if theres a sale."
28582,21/10 Would Kill Me Mate Again To Get Laid By A Hot Princess
28583,Fun to play with friends
28584,"tons of fun, if you have any friends play this with them. its a great source of laughs and a quaint little story. oh and remember one thing, all the princesses are yours to kiss, doesnt matter the color"
28585,The overall game is a great pick.  You won't be disappointed and you'll wonder why you haven't bought sooner.
28586,Super FUN
28587,"OK. I am gonna try to be calm with this one. So it's Castle Crashers! It's of course amazing! It's from Behemoth! But I will give it to you like a professional.

GAMEPLAY- It certainly has veriety when it comes to the gameplay. Controls are at a fast pace and the combat is all around great. You can move freely from the front to back of the stage. New combo's keep being unlocked with more intresting (slightly harder) buttons to press when in combat. I love how you can move free so you need the Gameplay at a 10

APPEAL- Well, Castle Crashers is long and has quite the challenging stages! It has...odd things sometimes but we all know how the Behemoth is. I would say that this goes to a more hardcore smackdown type game lover, because betting up baddies is what it is about! And then there is LASTING APPEAL, which is a full blown insanity meter from when you start a boss. I can play it quite continuiosly but when it's time for a boss fight, you wanna drown your tears in popcorn and a E rated game. So overall a 9 for both appeal areas.

Presentation- The game has really no amin flaws with presentation. Frame rate was made better in a recent update. The combat does not fall behind, but I kinda wish you got up from the ground quicker, because when someone got me with an arrow, by the time I get up he has got another loaded. The shield runs well and it is great how right smack dab in the middle of a swing, your shield comes right out so nothing hurts you. (Except for arrow's on the other side.) I would give it a 8 in presentation.

Fun- Overall, the main thing is fun. And this is where we see Castle Crashers at best! Who can get enough of the mindblowing hacks and slashes? Arena for the ones who could really step it up. Back off Barbarian for a mini-game with high scores. And ultamate bozo beating on the main campaign. Not much in the story side but thats not really a bother.
Castle Crashers is all around great and overall this comes as a 10!

THANK'S FOR READING!
"
28588,"Do you like button mashing?
Do you like magic?
Do you like seeing cartoon goblin heads rolling along the ground?
If the answer to any of these questions is yes then this game is for [b]YOU[/b]!"
28589,"A neat little classic.

Why do you not have this yet?
I don't give a shit you don't a have a controller.
No buts
Good boy"
28590,"wow 101/100
its boring without a friend"
28591,"alright this game is amazing cuz i was like screaming ""OH YEAH FIRST PLACE"" during the sled racing level from Club Penguin and i hit a log and then the character chasing us killed me so i died."
28592,One of the best games i have ever played with my brother
28593,"definitely one of my favourite games, really fun and dumb just the way i like it :P"
28594,"Awesome game to spend some time on, its interesting to play as different characters and with unique abilities. Another important factor is that you can team up with friends to put up a fight."
28595,The best part of the game for me was the fact you could play offline! I highly recommend it and i would like to know if anyone knows if their making a sequel out of it. Im in the last level and idk how the end will be but i would love that the game could continue somehow. Btw 2 questions : how do i use the 3rd magic and after u beat one of the last level bosses does it save or you need to restart all over if you lose?
28596,Best game of ALL TIME. Loved the castle crashers game on the old 360 but this version is 100 times better.
28597,this is one the best games i have ever played and is a good time for everyone
28598,"Only played an hour, but I already love every second of it. Gameplay is very fun, very good animations IMO (I'm a fan of any cartoons :D). Now I'm gonna actually play the storyline, but I'm already confident enough to recommend it to any fan of flash games."
28599,boss battles are awsome 10/10
28600,"The first game i have ever bought online definitely enjoyed the crap out of it and still to this day i sometime visit it 

great with friends 
has a big amount of hidden secrets and weapons and characters with most of them having unique/amazing skills"
28601,amazing combat very arcadey yet very addictive. Even better with friends easily the best beat em up of this decade just buy it already.
28602,"A good game to play with a group of friends, You can play online or local. It is a funny game and the fighting is fun. Only problem I have is the controls, I recommend either changing them or just using a controller."
28603,super good but bought it right be for black friday so i feel i got ripped off
28604,Behemoth did good.
28605,"Great game with friends, had a lot of laughs."
28606,Amazing game 11/10 :)

There's multiplayer minigames and INSANE MODE. If you are on the fence about it don't think. JUST DO IT! You will be so happy with it.  Get Castle Crashers NOW!

28650,Amazing game...
28651,說他是殿堂級的遊戲一點也不為過，隨著老一輩相繼退出遊戲界，覈心陣容紛紛轉致別的遊戲，這樣的全網咖只玩一個game的陣容已經是絕版，作為valve的千禧年之後的第一部看家大作，它的意義非同  aka its the best game ever dont even bother trasnlating that
28652,This game is super fun
28653,best. game. ever. 1000000/10
28654,"GREAT GAME
"
28655,"Awful gameplay and the lowest grade humor possible.

The very fact you can't skip a long-ass cutscene of a bear soiling itself every time you die in one of earliest levels is reason enough to hate this piece of garbage.

Is there a way to delete a game from my steam game list? I would pay money to permanently delete this game from my ownership. Worst purchase of my life, I am honestly ashamed to have played it."
28656,Awssssomeee game♥
28657,This game made me throw my controller across the room and scream like a 2 year old.    10/10 would scream again.
28658,"[h1]Social & addicting // Recommended if playing with friends[/h1]

[h1]*A controller is highly recommended for this game[/h1]

+ Art & visual style; endearing & aesthetically pleasing, to say the least
+ Melee combos are fun & easy to implement; there are additional combos unlocked throughout play
+ Magic complements melee combat &, as with the former, more spells are unlocked through play
+ Audio design & soundtrack is absolutely spectacular
+ Classic side-scroller mechanics; makes for a very nostalgic feel, while bearing the refinement of a newer title
+ Myriad unlockable characters, each of which feel unique in terms of play-style
+ Positively addictive gameplay, further enriched by the addition of friends
+ Makes use of some run-of-the-mill RPG elements, such as leveling and basic stat increases
+ Each level feels unique & entertaining in its own way
+ Multiplayer is the true meat of the game, & every aspect is enhance with a full party of friends
+ High replayability, due to sheer number of unlockables, & the entertaining nature of the content
+ Fun & interesting boss battles, each is just a bit unique in comparison to the last

- Noticeable lag in multiplayer, on several occasions; was not able to remedy or work around this for the most part

28672,"I loved this game a few years back. Then, one day I uninstalled it for some odd reason and forgot about it. It fell deep into my steam library. Then it was updated! I have a gaming laptop that isn't the best but can still run newer games on low settings. I cranked this game up to 1080p Ultra settings after the update, it ran wonderfully. This game I still play to this day and is a fairly short game, but you have to spend many hours completing it with every character. I love this game."
28673,muy buen juego
28674,"The new 60 fps uncap, make this game a lot better and quite a diferetn experience..........great game."
28675,"Nice Co-op game with friends
You can gain the best experience of this game by using a gamepad"
28676,Sidescrolling beat-em-up with chibi fantasy assets. Lots of old Newgrounds jokes. Great with friends.
28677,I like you buy.
28678,Instant fun with your friends!
28679,"Great art style, decent campaign, loads of fun with friends. Amazing OST, lovable characters (at least for me), can you ask for a better game? In fact... I hope Behemoth makes a 2nd one."
28680,Love this game so much ive played for a few years.Definitely Reccomend
28681,Amazing game to play with 3 people
28682,yes
28683,"if you like battleblock, you'll love this
"
28684,"Great game, but no linux version? The kernal seems to be in C# or at least something simular so I dont see why a linux version is not supported as it would be easy to do."
28685,"It's a fun game, I would call it the PC's version of Mario."
28686,[h1]I bought the game... Played for an hour or so... My friend invited me to his game... I found out this was a really good team building game... Then it got to the part that we had to fight over the princess... He rekt me... I bought both of the DLC... Now I train to get over his level... 11 hours... It's expanding! Halp xD[/h1]
28687,"Fun beat em up, best played with ""friends."""
28688,Quailty game with a decent story and great game play for the price.
28689,Good coop game. Complete campagin in 6 hrs
28690,"A button mash fest of epic proportions. 
I strongly recommend you play with a controller if you plan to get this game, as keyboard controls will leave you with nasty hand cramps before long, and frame rate can be a bit jumpy when playing multiplayer, but other than that i have nothing but praise for such a brilliant game!
"
28691,"A fun game to play with friends but kinda disappointed the All You Can Quaff mini game is being replaced, but the new game is more than enough to make someone panic :D"
28692,This game is a great co-op grinding game. I've played through this game countless times and keep coming back.
28693,"One of my very favorite games, for fun memories, as well as creative funny humor!"
28694,Very good
28695,"Funny Review. 
i got recked by 20+ goblins that were trying to stop on me. 10/10 would get stomped on again.
 Normal review.
 i have  to say castle crashers is one of my fav multiplayer games out there. but i have to say this new update has put it in the top 5 for my list"
28696,Amazing for playing with friends
28697,Good fun with friends.
28698,"i love this game plz make another with more campain you did a VERY good job on this

28703,"[h1] Insanely fun, even more so with friends. I've had some great moments in this game. [/h1]

The recent (at the time of this review) barbarian update made this game so much smoother and removes [b]most[/b] (if not all) of the lag in multiplayer games.

"
28704,it was fun
28705,"If you like a beatemup game with an awsome soundtrack and thatle just make you laugh this game is for you

28706,cool!i love this game!

28708,Good button masher.  Even better with a couple of frields.
28709,"Cool game until you get to the ending. Still, it's worth getting."
28710,"The game is still broken when playing with friends.  This game will not allow you to play with your friends.  It will randomly kick one or all off the people in the game to the starting menu.  Get this for Xbox if you must but I cannot recomend a game that is not playable as intended. 

Fix your shit."
28711,Fun
28712,Addicting and fun to play with friends or alone
28713,"Summary
Castle Crashers is a classic Beat 'Em Up game that never gets old.
You can play alone, or play with friends! Up to 4 to be exact.
The campaign/story is a good one, very memorable. After you beat normal mode, you can go on to insane mode! Weapons damage weaker and enemy's health go higher. It's kinda like Legendary-difficulty Halo 3 with all skulls activated.
..but guess what? There is more than just campaign! There are lots of fun to go around to everybody!
There is a mode called Arena. Arena is a mode where you fight your friends or random people! Let the best man win!
Also, there is a new mode avaliable with the remaster. It is called ""Back Off Barbarian!"" It is an addicting board-like game, you choose where your character goes, and it will go there! AMAZING! Just make sure you get away from the bad guys. Of course, the bad guys.

Pros
Lots of content.
Easy campaign/story mode for all types of gamers! (Beginner, Medium, Good, Gamer, MLG, etc)
Great soundtrack.
Graphics are 60 fps.
A really big number of characters! (31)
Lots of animal orbs (pets) and weapons.

Cons
Insane mode is too hard for just one player.
Multiplayer can sometimes be laggy.

So, that basically sums up my review.
I give this game a healthy 98/100!"
28714,"This game is a great beat em up game with a lot of good humor in it. I havent completed this game but what i can say is that this is fun like most indie games.

7.5/10"
28715,"Amazing game! I feared it might be too short of a game but I was completely wrong! Completely addicting and with tremendous replayability, I haven't even finished the game once and already have ~20 hours in. The game's difficulty doesn't allow a shallow ""just pass"" the game, you'll die a lot if you don't know how to fight!"
28716,Super Ultra Mega Game
28717,Immature and annoying as hell to play alone.
28718,"This game is amazing. Me and my friend have racked up at least 50 hours in the last week. It's very replayable and the characters are fairly unique. The gameplay and controls are very appealing along with the graphics. It doesn't require a very good computer either. Mine personally is from 2007 and it runs like a dream. Over all I rate this game 10/10.


P.S. Don't ever agree to 100% the game.... ever....."
28719,This game is really fun
28720,A tonne of co-op fun. Highly recommended.
28721,Awesome game! I love the art style and the humor!!!
28722,"thhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeee bbbbbeeeeeeeessssssttttt ggggaaaaammmmmeeeeee eeeeeevvvvveeeerrrrr 
"
28723,"Just the best game on steam to play with friends. But if you are a lone wolf, don't worry, it still pretty good."
28724,"Really great game and even better if you get friends to play with, but I wanted it to be longer or at least a 2nd game

10/10"
28725,"Castle Crashers is a simple game and a simple concept, you run from left to right and beat up enemies with melee weapons, ranged weapons and magics. It's a full package of really fun co-op, engaging singleplayer, comedy that actually works, adrenaline-pumping action and well balanced achievements for the completionists in us. If you've got a couple of friends willing to try, you'll have a great time. Even alone, it's definately worth the price of purchase without being on sale.

The major problem of the game comes in form of the ingame unlocks. You have no idea how to unlock stuff and can easily play through the campaign with hardly any new pets, weapons or characters to play. You'll also have to re-level every character, which can become tedious. 
Finally, the replayability after you've gone through the game a couple of times becomes basically none. However, for 10-15 hours of good gameplay, Castle Crashers is worth its cost."
28726,"This is the second time I've played Castle Crashers and the first time on PC. It is still my favorite side scrolling beat em up. Behemoth has tapped into what made old school beat em up games great and slathered on their own hysterical style into every crevice of the genre. You'll fight catfish (half cat half fish) bosses, terminator referencing bosses, ride anally convulsive dear away from shadow monsters, ride your weapons through the heavens, escape the Alien Hominid mothership, the list goes on and on of memorable moments. Choose your hero and go to town on the baddies. Get new weapons, new magic, new sidekicks along the way, or add 3 friends to the roster for a crack addled experience. It's simple great fun, and often hella cheap these days. If you haven't played this game yet then shame on you. Pick it up and play it now!"
28727,"Realy cool game, Addicting and hilarious. In this game the point is not just finishing the story, but also collecting all the different characters, weapons and pets. I recommend this game to everyone, there is no one who can hate this game."
28728,buy and have fun
28729,"A modern day beat'em up. Has some light RPG elements with character progression. Bosses are clever and I love the comedic flare, but the weapons are mostly the same and you're pretty much just fighting the same dudes all game. It's okay, but I think some classic beat'em ups edge this one out.

6/10"
28730,"It's a must buy if you want to play with friends. The game has a great story and great music. Also, magic is op and aerials are op as well."
28731,Newgrounds FTW
28732,"I can't say I finished entirely, I even got carried from the beginning by a high level !
I could anyway analyse the biggest points of this game :
It's very very fun, to be honest we have a good time, we rekt mobs, we die (not that much though). By the way it's also a downside. It's way too easy, we complete the game in one or two days if we play seriously. Moreover, you can complete it only by smashing the attack button, the combos are here but not too useful.
To conclude we can say that it's a game to relax, to kick some asses, but you won't find a game with a complex background for example."
28733,"Holy fucking shit.... This game is alright and shit, except excessive lag during a long gameplay which forces you to restart the game. It's apparently badly optimized. YOU CAN NOT RESET YOUR TALENTS ARGHGHGHH, AND MAGIC USERS GETS LESS EXP THAN MELEE CAUSE THE EXP SYSTEM IS BASED ON hits. JESUS FUCKING RETARD DEVELOPERS"
28734,"10/10 needs more golden poop ""MUH POOP"" - Castalier"
28735,AWESOME  way fun and many hours of gameplay
28736,Great for parties. Plays extremely well on a TV from the couch with a controller.
28737,"One of the best Games i've ever played, great mechanics and a catchy themesong"
28738,"Dear people who dislike the game for the controls,

I use the keyboard, just like you, however you'll notice I'm not throwing a hissy fit because of it.
Know why?
I ACTUALLY SPENT 5 MINUTES IN THE CONTROLS SETTINGS.

Dear people who dislike the game for the lag,

I've played the multiplayer, and I have experienced lag.
I have two solutions.
Either play singleplayer (which does not make you a loner)
Or play with people with good internet connection ( it's not the game's fault your friends have crappy internet)"
28739,"i mean, yeah, I love it, it's just super easy to blow through it all and finish it
all there really is to do after the first 10 hours is to grind
still good"
28740,i love this game soo much!
28741,"sippin wine thru my pisser,,  yessir , im a rascal !"
28742,"Really fun game to mess around in. I really like the art in this game; and the enemies are very creative and funny. Grab this game for some friends. Make sure it's on sale though, get the four pack for like 10 dollars."
28743,"Fun little flash game with goofy/traditional knight saving the princess story. 
Get it when on sale, would not reccomend at full price, it's still a flash game."
28744,"I used to play this when it came out on xbox, it was literally the best game I had played at that time. What I really liked were the art (I love the cartoony style), character design (I love the the samuri guy), easter eggs."
28745,It cool i did a 2 hour special on it for my 30 sub special.
28746,"Good co-op fun.
I wholeheartedly recommended this product or service."
28747,"just play with friends, alone is half of the experience."
28748,i wanted to be the red knight but my friend took the red knight
28749,"This Game is the Best with friends, i had a blast playing it!"
28750,"i like tranes

28751,"Super fun game. It might not be so good for single player, but it's crazy enjoyable with friends. A little longer than i'd like but still it's a great game."

28755,"11/10

3 Thumbs Up!!!

Very recommend, Much awesome!"
28756,"Classic 2D Beat 'Em Up. My favorite thing about this game has gotta be the art. You may recognize the companies work from Newgrounds and other flash game websites, but Castle Crashers is fleshed out enough that its worth the money. 

Loads of weapons to unlock, plenty of variety in environments and enemies, and incredibly memorable bosses make for a great multiplayer experience. I will say that its much easier to play locally or with voice chat though. One thing some people may not like about the game is that it appears to be multiplayer only. Much like Monaco, it has a connect with strangers feature as well as playing with friends which doesn't require you to find a server.
EDIT: Whoops! Actually has singleplayer, I just didn't see it.

Its a little bit of a button masher at times, but overall not a bad game. I'd suggest getting it on sale like I did."
28757,It's funny with friends.
28758,"Muito divertido, jogabilidade simples, perfeito pra jogar com os amigos! Vale a pena cada centavo!"
28759,"Great game love the graffics amazing story 
Its a 10 from Len"
28760,Still amazing
28761,Its Amazing one of the best games Ive everved play. Good job Behemoth
28762,"Love this game, it's fun, funny, and really awesome to play with multiple people.10/10"
28763,"A great game with funny plot-twists everywhere. This game...
It's just so random! It's fun and it's simply amazing!"
28764,"Castle Crashers was one of my first purchases on Steam, and I honestly have nothing negative to say about this game. Whether you're playing Solo or with your Friends, Castle Crashers has much to offer. The leveling aspect is a great way to invest lots of time grinding so that you can have that slight edge over the bosses throughout the game. The side scrolling 2/3D hybrid is a great aspect for this cartoon beat em up. It's much fun with friends to help revive you and support you along the way, and with each of your magics having a different ability the team combos are virtually endless. Beautiful cartoon and high definition graphics with an uncapped framerate make it appealing to the eye, and the soundtrack will keep your headphones on almost all the time you play it. With fun and NEW minigames to play with after the Remastered update, Castle Crashers is a game you'll enjoy alone or with friends, and can definitely invest a few hours into."
28765,"Although I haven't played the game much and only started playing it with my friend is this game gives of flash animated games a whole new reason to be played. The way the games storymode plays out is quite the same as any Beat'em up in a Medieval setting. The way game mechanics or very fluent(well they are fluent unless you set the keys to your liking)and the attack keys are great as well for dominating foes(well if you call dominating foes by spaming the attack keys which is my tactic). The last I have to say about this is the art design, not only is it epic fighting against enemys its also pretty hilarious to see whats in the background and foreground."
28766,"-Great music

-Sweet ending

Yes this game will literally CHANGE your life."
28770,"Oh my god i got a steam account just to play The Behemoth games. Out of the 3 that they have released, this is definitely my favorite one. There are countless hours worth of gameplay (especially if you are a completionist) that will keep you busy for hours and hours. If you have Steam, YOU HAVE TO GET THIS GAME."
28771,THIS GAME IS COOOL
28772,"challenging fun lots of weapons to choose from and what i didnt like is that it allowed people to up to lvl 99 and have no skulls

28776,"After knowing that there was no lamborghinies in this game, I was very upset. But still, i'm here in my room playing this humm new game here but in fact, do you now what I like much more than this game? KNAWLEDGE! I'm much more proud of my seven new Bookshelves I installed to hold my 2000 books I never read."

28778,"I have bought this game 2 times on xbox, and now on pc, its epic add it to your cart."
28779,Awesome Party Game with Friends
28780,I just love this game. The first game I bought on steam.
28781,"a beat em up that i can enjoy many times.
the characters offer variety not in it biggest form but big enough to give them theyr own feel.
really shines with friends in a skype call co-oping (or arena deathmatching)"
28782,"fun, but annoying when you die and have to start over AND OVER . overall a good game 4/5 starts"
28783,"I wanted to enjoy this game, but cant.
For one the game is very boring
A tacked on ability system via a pointless ""level up"" system that must be included in every modern game regardless of how necessary it is or isnt. It has no real purpose
Multiple characters that are all identical except for mostly useless ""magic""
You must play the ""best"" character making 95% of them irrelevant. Coupled with the stat points, which also produce the same result between stats.
You can find weapons, but again its pointless because 95% are useless or redundant
Online community that plays this game is downright awful, you will be kicked for not rushing through as fast as you can
It follows the modern gaming trend of quantity over quality.
No one plays the game, everyone grinds solo but with others.
Playing with friends doesnt help as the game lags like crazy, dropping players for no reason but not letting them rejoin without restarting. 
No in game chat, so youre constantly forced to tab out to steam. 
Just leaves you feeling isolated when you should feel like a group
Overall gameplay is bland and uninteresting, with humor straight out of 1rst grade and modern acid trip style graphics the young kiddies think is amazing. The graphics themselves are great, its the animation and enemies...ect  are something a mental patient would adore
WAY too late to get a refund, not even worth .50$ 2/10
"
28784,is so good!
28785,Very fun and creative game. Recommended for people who enjoy a Medival Style 2D game.
28786,"This is me reviewing the game's solo modes. One thing I have to say is  this game (if you are going solo), is best in short periods as iin maybe an hour max. The new ""back off barabrian"", game is made specificly for xbox controllers. As a PS3 user this made it hard to enjoy, as of 11/8/15 There is no patch for this problem. But everything beyond that is spot on. From the music, story, gameplay, bosses, originallity, blah, blah, blah, etc."
28787,SO MUCH FUN :P
28788,"Great game 

only cons: its kinda dead + gets boring after a few re plays"
28789,"Great game, great plot, hilarious story plots, and just about the best game for multiplayer out there!"

28791,"this game is one of my favourouts
"
28792,"Good game although...

Castle Crashers is a great game. I originally had it on my Xbox but decided to get the Pc version to see better graphics new controls and a new game mode. At the time I have no friends that have it for the Pc. I expected the new game mode to be at least decent but it wasn`t very good...at all. Until I get friends to play with me I give 8/10"

the gameplay is so good
"
28800,"a simple yet fun to play, this game is very entertaining with hack and slash and smash, reminds me of a good old arcade game, and this game is a co-op game so good luck finding victory with your friends"
28801,"By the same people who later made BattleBlock Theater, and both games are pure effing gold. This game is a lot different in gameplay than BattleBlock Theater, though. This game is a side-scrolling RPG with magic and swords. Co-op with friends is one of the funnest experiences ever. If you beat your friends in combat after the boss battle, you get a kiss from the princess, so have fun cock-blocking your friends! The stylization of the game really has an irresistible charm. Great art, great smooth gameplay, hilarious characters. Totally recommend!"
28802,Mash 2 buttons: LMB and RMB (in my controls); instantly beat the game.

28806,"cool game
!"
28807,I still have no idea what all the buttons i mashed on my controllers do in this game .
28808,This game is really worth the money you pay for it. I've bought Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and thats pretty fun but this is better. Really worth the time/money you put into this!
28809,Pretty good for the first few hours but gets very repetative very quickly
28810,very ebic
28811,Kiss all the princesses 10/10 beta than mario
28812,Great side scrolling beat-em up. A must play if the price is right (usually around $3). Funny and fun to play.
28813,"Let me just get to the point here. You need this game, you want this game.  There is nothing but this game as it has its quarky moments that end up being too damn funny with friends.

28819,gg
28820,"This game is so fun, even when I die in the game it's still fun, it's so fun I bought both DLCs available so I could have even more fun! This game is the best, even if it is suggested you use a controller, just play it anyway if you only have keyboard (although I recommend changing the set keyboard commands immediately, I know I did). Lag is never a problem (which is great cause my computer is not good at playing games), and I still haven't gotten bored of it!"

28839,great game
28840,Single player is fun for a while but its a much better experience with friends. Just don't let them quit on you causing you to never play the game again though.

28842,Game is full of pooping animals. 5/5 would see pooping animals again.
28843,yes because its fun and interactive plus challengeing :] make more DLC`s !!!!!!
28844,"Please play this game with a controller please.

Castle Crashers is an honestly silly game involving you, maybe three other friends, and sharp objects with which to stab other things with. Each colored knight has this ability which corralates to its color; in a sort of elemental attack or so.

Its a fun and zany stab-em-up game with a penchant for mob-based mechanics which in my opinion, is the best and most fun way to do it. The best feeling is when you throw a dude into a bunch of other dudes.

The art style is cute, but its unknown to me if its trying to be funny. I laughed anyway.

My only real complaint is its rather easy to ram bosses into a corner and keep right on hitting them, and they can't do a darn thing as they're much too busy recoiling from my hits. Bosses are easy to cheese, is what I'm saying.

Play it with friends if you can. I got four USB hookups. Let's do this. The green one is my favorite because poison.

9/10"
28845,its a good game.you should play it
28846,BEST! GAME! EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
28847,"A fun game that i can pull out anytime and play during class periods at school. It is quite addictive, the game mechanics are easy, and it gets really fun when you get your friends to join you. The gameplay is repetitive but the story and art is a beauty and quite comedic to some extent. It is a great game to pull out when you are bored.  :D"
28848,"I was gifted this game by my boyfriend and so far it's been pretty entertaining. 
I didn't like the medusa boss, she moved very awkwardly and it was just kind of an annoying one to beat. Also, the pillars in the Sand biome, when you're going through the castle get in your way during battle. That was the most annoying part considering my boyfriend had to revive me without seeing the meter and i couldn't see my enemies majority of the time.

I really like the wide range of weapons/pets & am hoping for armour to be added later.
If you wanna get money really quickly I suggest beating the barbarian boss over and over (you get a load of gems and coins) or if you want exp one hit kills are pretty sweet if you wanna do it quickly (like the scorpions and in the sand biome, the barbarians before the boss and the alien minions on the space craft).

Overall the game is about an 8/10 just because of those couple of annoying features and the fact that I've had to grind like a lil bitch for hours to get high enough levels to progress.
I'm not yet done but am really enjoying it so far."
28849,"Just not my thing, really."
28850,Very fun:)
28851,Really fun game to play with friends and alone.
28852,Amazing game. 10/10
28853,Awesome Game Its Good For Friend Gaming
28854,"The maturity level of the developers may be up for debate, but there's no debating that this game is a unique and fun experience. Especially when had with friends. Funny game, good gameplay, and an all around great time"
28855,"Great Game!!Verry Fun And Funny
"
28856,Worth the price
28857,"It's still awesome.
I still stand by it."
28858,"Controls are hard to understand, the game is very repetative, I didn't enjoy it very much. Most likely a game for those who enjoy button mashing or own a controller."
28859,"classic game, great animation, great gameplay. i suggest play this game with your friend..
really recomended game
10/10"
28860,10/10
28861,"This game is hands-down one of the best games I have EVER played.

The cartoon-like style and smooth animation is really good, and each knight which you can play as has their own strengths and weaknesses, which I love.

This game is filled to the brim with humor and adventure, and has so much work put into it. I HIGHLY recommend this game - whether you're a solitary fighter or rather kill in a pack - this game will bring smiles to anyone and EVERYONE.

I can't even list a fault in this game, it is that good.

So do yourself a favor and purchase this game, alongside it's other buddies, Battleblock Theater, Alien Hominid and soon to be Pit People. 

11/10 would play again"
28862,this game is AWSOME

28868,it is awesome! plz make a new game
28869,"No matter the platform, I have always loved playing this game because it reaches back to the 2D platforms of the 1980's.  It puts a new spin on the genre, and I love all of the humor that's in the game as well.

Don't think.  Just buy and play this game if you never have before.  It's worth every penny and then some."

28881,Lost my friend while playing this game 1/10 buy it now
28882,"Awesome game, even years later. The team really delivered with this one as well as with Battleblock theater. Had so much fun with it, especially in co-op mode. Great and hillarious story with awesome (mostly button mash) combat. The art style is very unique, colorful and  really grows on you. I recommend it to anyone."
28883,Pro Tip: Press all the buttons in the controller.

28896,"Fun game heres a list of things i like about it 
-Godly game to play with friends 
-Love the way you progress so fast 
-Easy to learn for a chill game 
-Fun. for example you play beach volley against your enemies at one point 
-You get around at a bunch of locations for examples you fight against aliens,Medusa and a big ass black thingy 
Maybe a little short but very fun game played with my older brother"
28897,This game made my computer run like a potato
28898,"Love this game, works gr8 with a ps3 controller hooked up to it."
28899,"Let's start with the obvious, the controls, now when I play it does give controls for a keyboard, but the controls are rather klunky. For example; I'm mashing the light and heavy attack buttons and try jumping, but instead use a potion that I didn't need because the buttons are so close. for the first part of the game I kept forgetting to use the arrow keys to move because the arrow keys are next to never used in other games.

Next point, the difficulty, now before I hear people whining about this hear me out. When I played single player, I could hardly fight hoards of enemies because they keep spamming magic and arrows that keep you pinned down until you die. ""Why not use the shield?"" well you can't because the shield won't block magic, and when you are getting shot by arrows, it's on both sides. By the time I reached the final boss I was probably around level 40 and still had problems with it.

This next point I haven't experienced but I have seen many complaints about it. The apparent lag that is online multiplayer. Apparently people couldn't play with anyone because of the amount of lag there is.

Another point I would like to note is the weapons. No not the weapons themselves. The drop rate of the weapons. I played probably 6+ hours trying to grind for one weapon. I have seen people on forums saying they have spent longer than that for a different weapon. I understand it is to balance the difficulty, but there is no need to balance the difficulty if it is too hard to even go through the game.

To summarize. The controls are clunky because the mapping of controls were iffy. The difficulty is high for single player. The complaints of lag in online, and the absurd weapon drop rate. So I would recommend it if there was no lag that I hear about, and if it was actually fun alone. But because of the already listed points, I do not recommend it."
28900,THIS A GREAT GAME BUY THE FUCKING THING
28901,"Loved it! A lot of fun, played for hours for several days! <3"
28902,This game is a lot of fun especialy with friends. Though I don't think I'll play through the whole campaign as each character I'll at least beat it with the four main ones and the two DLC ones. Though it gets a bit repettitive it's still a lot of fun. Playing alone sucks so make sure to play this with a friend.
28903,"extremely fun, and like Behemoth's policy that Dlc money goes to charity"
28904,"Oh you havent bought this game yet well... you probably shouldn't, I almost died trying to comprehend how AWESOME this game is.

11/10, because who doesnt like sh*ting animals."
28905,such a nastolgic game that if i ever struggle to get an erection that lasts for for than 4 hours i play this with friends
28906,11/10。
28907,"Awesome game! Has all the elements of a traditional side-scroller with the added bonus of giving a ""third-deminsional"" depth aspect. I highly reccomend this game and give it 5 stars."

28911,Tis Good
28912,"ok ok iam the pig 
of pigs

"
28913,yes
28914,"The pvp is meh but the storyline is great if you're playing it with friends. It seems like it could get repetitive but right as you might start to get bored of a level you fight a unique boss and move on to the next level. While I wish the overall game was longer the length of each level is perfect and even the story is highly replayable with friends.

Basically what I'm saying is it's good if you have friends, if you don't it's not as good but still not bad."
28915,old but gold
28916,aesome
28917,Since the new update its even more better! 100/10
28918,"The developers seem to have a difficult time understanding the importance of line of sight and continually place things between the camera and your character. It's frustrating. Other than that, the game is okay."
28919,great game but very hard at times
28920,"12/10
fun ^^"
28921,"Are you tired ofall those boring blockbuster first person shooters?
Do you like button mashing?

"
28923,Awsome! myst play!
28924,"A great game filled with humor, action and a little bit of romance. 
Story is great altho not a lot of it makes sense.
A great game to play with friend on a tv."
28925,"This game is honestly one of my favorite gaming experiences from the last decade.  I grew up playing 2D side-scrolling beat 'em ups in arcades (yes, those still existed in my day), but it has been quite a long time since I've played anything new in that genre.  Enter Castle Crashers.  This game had a ton of hype after its success on consoles, and luckily it lived up to that hype.  Castle Crashers is a beat 'em up with a couple of twists.  It adds combos to the combat system, which mixes things up and adds variety.  In addition the characters level up and have stats that you can put experience points into, as well as you're able to equip different weapons with different stats.  These RPG-like additions mean that you can play the game in different ways (rely on speed, heavy damage, magic, etc.).  This really adds to the game, and ensures that you have a unique experience.  While the story is a bit weak, the overall length of the game and the variation in game levels is phenomenal.  The game even offers a new game+ mode after you beat it.  This game screams multiplayer, but I played it predominantly as a single player due to a lack of friends interested in playing.  While I ran into no problems playing the regular mode as a single player, about halfway through the new game+ mode I found it too difficult to progress.  I suppose I could have grinded my character's level at that point, but instead I chose to start a brand new character and play the game in a different manner this time (I would rely on magic).  Overall this game is a joy, and builds upon and improves on the formula set out by such classics as Double Dragon and Final Fight.  This game is so good that it makes me wonder why it took so long for someone to rejuvenate the beat 'em up genre.  This game is fantastic and I would rate it a 9.5/10."
28926,"I loved playing this game with my friends on the Xbox 360 and its still amazing to play on the PC as well.

28934,This game is lots of fun and is amazing when you have friends to play with. Lots of fun trying to complete the campain by myself. So much easier with friends helping. Offers lots of options and things to do. New updates gave it cooler game modes. So much fun and I never get bored.
28935,BEHEMOTH STEPS INTO THE ARENA! yes. GG Behemoth. amazing. freaking. beauty.

astonishing woww"
28944,"I haven't gotten particularly far in this game since I really just play it with my partner.  It's a fun game for us to both sit back and just smash some things though without overly frustrating consequences.  More than the game itself though it's just fun to to listen to swear at the enemies and get really into it.  I adore it as a social experience.  As a game it's honestly kind of repetitive, but the funny interactions and expressions of the characters definitely lighten up the mood."
28945,"Really good i bought it for 1,99 on a sale."
28946,install gentoo
28947,Cuteness overload. how i wish Pink Knight appears in DOTA 2 as a hero..

28949,The ultimate River City Ranson/Double Dragon/Fatal Fury replacement. Co-op is mandatory.
28950,Awesome and fun coop gameplay. Reminiscent of old Megadrive games like Golden Axe.
28951,"This game... Holy shit.

This was the game that brought me to a great genre (arguably repetitive), the Beat-Em-Up genre.
Its really good! It introduces you into a new mechanic that, in my opinion, is great: The Pet System.
It works like this: Trough out the game, there is this adorable animals that you can collect by exploring the level, or the game giving them to you, though its really rare, and usually just happens in the beggining. All pets gives you diferent ability or the pet itself has an ability. I personally didn't find any useless pet.
The combat system is great, never repetitive and a great variation of enemys.


At the end of the day:

Its an amazing game, and you should pick it up, specially if you are a Beat-Em-Up fan.
Its also begginer friendly.
The price is great.
Buy or Die.

8/10 - Story is amazingly cliche, once you've finished insane mode, it can become quite repetitive.

Notes: All the money earned in dlc are going for a great cause, and the price is good. One of the only games you should buy dlc for."
28952,Remember golden axe and old arcade games? yes? want something similar that has a degree of progression added? yes? Why the hell are you reading this boring stuff for when you could get this game and start having fun right now!
28953,It was the best.
28954,This game is addicting but in a good way.
28955,"Divertido,Entretenido y un buen juegazo!!!

28957,Love this game I got this because I likes battle block theatre so I fort I would get this great game would consider you to get it 10/10 for this game
28958,Not worth $1.49
28959,"Excelente jogo para se jogar com amigos, extremamente engraçado e divertido. Recomendo."
28960,Good game.
28961,"Good game, can't say how much time I've put in between PC and the 360 version. Insane mode is also good for when you're feeling a bit masochistic."
28962,"Pros: Game seems very stable, graphics mean it will run on a potato. Humour is funny (the first time). Poop jokes. Coop works nicely.

Cons: Designed to make you grind.. and you can keymash your way through pretty quickly as long as you put equal points in everything and you are a high enough level. Trying to play around with the stat choices makes you very vulnerablem suggesting the ""rpg element"" is just there as a gimmick. Humour gets old quickly, Lots of ""on rails"" moments which noone really likes. Linear. PC port is very very console. No ingame chatting so if you're playing over the internet it;s Steam-chat or voice."
28963,"This game is what I would call a classic of the modern gaming era. It's not exactly new, but it still manages to keep a certain freshness to it, which is actually quite impressive. 

When I say ""classic"", I mean a game that is a sort of important pillar to gaming in general. Now, I wouldn't say that it changed the whole industry per say, but I still consider this one to be a game that is part of my childhood to an extend. Many can possibly relate to that thought, I'd wager.

Now, what exactly is Castle Crashers? Well, to resume the whole experience in a single sentence, it's basically a ""smash right through the enemies, save the princesses and defeat the evil king"". Sounds simple, doesn't it? That's no surprise; because this game is simple. 

The true experience truly comes to life when you bring a friend or two along the ride. As most multiplayer games, having someone to play with you really is a must to enjoy the full adventure. Honestly, playing through this game alone is kind of boring, and considering that the designs of the levels highly support multiplayer, trying to go through the game alone can prove to be a chore. Then again, I did play and finish it alone the first time, but when I replayed it with a few folks, my overall opinion changed drastically.

This game is huge. Don't let the tiny sixteen bucks tell you otherwise; it's probably one of the biggest adventures I've seen for a Smash 'em up. The adventure itself isn't much to speak about, my friends and I started from the beginning and finished after around four sessions of one hour each. What makes this thing so huge is the unlockable content. There are a ton of them, such as characters, pets, weapons, levels, and even a secret difficulty. You'll be grinding and repeating the same levels many times to find rare items and weapons if completion matters to you. 

I'd like to speak about the difficulty, since I feel like difficulty is something that matters for many players and buyers. The game in itself isn't harshly hard. Most bosses have simple patterns, the level designs can be either fair or sometimes overwhelming, and the overall product will not make you frustrated to the point of screaming. Of course, I won't say that it is an easy game either; sometimes it feels like the game throws so much at you, I find it almost unfair. Without spoiling too much, the final boss in particular has a lot of annoying patterns that can drag for a while, especially if alone. 
Upon finishing the game, you will have the option of changing to an even harder difficulty. I will warn you : It is cheap. Enemies are insanely powerful, and quite frankly, it's not fun. If that sounds appealing to you, then go ahead and try it. I, for one, will stay away and advices you to do so as well.

The game has two primary mechanics : Physical attacks and Magical moves. Physical attacks are, as the name says, attacks with weapons. The damage that you will do to enemies is generated by how much points to give to your Physical stats. Magical moves are attacks composed of magic. Giving points to this stat will not only grow your magical abilities and make them more powerful, it will also make the range and overall usefulness much more adaptable. 

The best idea would be to try to make a balanced knight, since enemies later on will either be extremely resistant to Physical attacks or highly resistant to Magic. You always need to have an alternative, or else it becomes truly bothersome. 


I believe that I mentioned every aspects worth mentioning. This game is great, and while not a masterpiece by any means, it should prove itself quite worthy of your purchase. Do not forget to try and ask a few friends if they wish to play along!"
28964,"If you have friends to play it, do. It's loads of fun with a bunch of buddies. If you don't have friends, you can still buy it, but the playing experience is nowhere near as fun and nobody plays online."
28965,god gam
28966,"it won't let me play

28972,This is the best game ever! Get it! Get it! Get it!
28973,"Castle Crasher just as funny as Battle block theater!

What is it about?
-In CC you are a Knight(maybe along with some freinds) in the middle of a war and all the beatiful princesses have been captured, your job is to go around kicking the big bad bosses butts...and win, then make out with the princesses :) (cha ching) :)

How do I beat the bosses?
-Around the little world you can find shop's and in those shops you can buy better sword's and uprgrade your Charactor
-In some shops you can buy pets!

What do I need a pet for?
-Pets are there to follow you around and buff you up
-buffs can range from extra health too pooping out GOLD bar's!

My opinion...
-This game was very fun too play (I like middevil stuff so you know) I do how ever wish that we had that annoyingly hilarious comentater from battle block theater though but whatever.
-I do how ever like the fact that you have a secondary power up.

Be sure to Follow Me...and my freinds for more reviews and game play!
Have a good one Guy's!"
28974,"Tons of hours of just straight-up FUN! This game  used to be really laggy multiplayer, but that's been patched up! This game is especially more fun when you have friends to play with. This is a 10000/10 in my book."

28989,"Although the multiplayer was dead for a while, you could still find people to play with once in a while on the forums. The game is very replayable with different characters, magic, and character builds (kind of). Should you play a character enough, your build will not really matter as you can eventually max everything any way. However, the game has just been updated, meaning that there will likely be a few more people playing it for a while.

The simple and basic RPG elements of the game make it fun, while holding action packed feel to it as well. With a little comedic humor, this is a classic game to play with friends."
28990,"This game is amazing, its really tough if you play alone though, so i would suggest either buying friends the game or convincing them to get it, if you wanna know what the game is like, Markiplier played it on his channel, id rate this game a smacking 10/10"

28996,"I wrote a review a while back, but with the recent update it really needed rewritten. 

I recommended it before and I'll recommend it again. Instead of being a simple console port, Castle Crashers is now a pretty damn good PC game. They upped the framerate cap to 60, increased texture resolution, added in keyboard button prompts that change automatically if you switch input methods, and possibly even increased screen resolution options, I'm not sure it supported 2560x1440 before, but it does now. It's awesome to see the game running this smooth and it's definitely worth a replay.

As far as gameplay, there's not much new from the previous version. There's a new (frustrating) game mode and ""All You Can Quaff"" is gone. I'm pretty sure deleting that mini-game should be considered a feature. It was terrible. Otherwise, Castle Crasher is still as great of a co-op beat 'em up as ever."
28997,"It's hard to imagine that Castle Crashers is a 7 year old game. It still looks amazing and plays like a dream, far better then a lot of recent beat-em-ups and action games. It features a fully co-op campaign and a lot of zany mini-games and absurdist jokes. It's quite a treat.

I originally played the game back in 2008 when it first launched on Xbox 360. I found it a joy and immediately got my friends into it. We spent many a night besting the levels and doing our best to max out our characters. It was a true joy to have a new age, HD beat-em-up with game mechanics that actually advanced the genre.

Blocking has long been something missing from beat-em-ups. The simple, cynical reason is that these old games were made for the arcade scene. Staking the odds in the players favor might make them feel more empowered, but it also would limit the amount of quarters you'd be getting from any individual. Blocking didn't make sense from a business standpoint.

While Castle Crashers isn't the first beat-em-up to feature such a simple maneuver, it adds a lot of complexity on top of an already deep brawler. There are combos, magic and a lite-RPG system to grade your progress through the game. Leveling up and getting new skills makes the minute to minute gameplay very compelling and prevents the gamer from ever reaching a brick wall, in terms of progress.

I can't say that every single level is 100% perfect, but the game rarely has a dull moment. Even when it does, the bright colors and brisk framerate help keep your mind engaged. The recently released update (which mirrors Castle Crashers Remastered for Xbox One) improves a lot of the stability and balance of the game. Certain joke characters are now actually viable as a means of besting the bosses.

One mini-game was removed in the new update, but it's abscence isn't missed. I'm not sure why they didn't leave it, but I don't really care that it's gone. The new mini-game, Backoff Barbarian, is a blast. It's strange to see arrows instead of controller inputs, but being as this is the PC version, I am willing to let that slide.

The graphics have also received a nice boost in size and clarity. Neglecting to use them still provides a solid image, but the larger sprites make the game feel alive in a way that wasn't possible before. It's also far easier to discern what is going on in chaotic scenes, which is definitely a welcome change.

About the only downside is that this update doesn't include the two DLC characters. Those are relatively cheap and the proceeds go to charity, but it would have been nice to give players access without asking for more money. Regardless, the price of the game is cheap and definitely worth it, so I can't complain.

That I'm still thinking about this game and playing it after nearly a decade is a testament to how good the quality is here. Castle Crashers is absolutely a classic of the genre and one that ever fan of old-school, 2D style brawlers should own. Now that is plays better on PC, you really don't have much of an excuse to skip this.

28999,Awesome game. The lack of keyboard instructions is a con.
29000,Still waiting for a Linux version...
29001,fun fun :D
29002,"super fun game. easy to learn, hard to master. a gamepad/controller is kinda a must for this game, as is a friend, unless you really like grinding the same levels over and over. nonetheless, being a game only played with others is not a bad thing, as this is one of the best local multiplayer offerings there is on any console."
29003,"Remastered Version

60 Fps
New Minigame
Increased Texture Sizes
New Layout

This brought a tear to my eye as soon as I played the game and saw the new layout."
29004,"best game ever
"
29005,"Theres already like thousands of reasons why you should play from other reviews but yes this game is great and amazing, the graphics and gameplay are outstanding and it doesn't lag at all. (haven't tried the online yet so im not sure about that but will soon) if you plan to buy this game dont buy the ps3 or xbox 360 version either buy this or the xbox one version (perfer steam just because most of my friends play on here and steam is awesome :D but your choice wont stop you there both the same) because steam and xbox one have the remastered version and with the updated everything its just awesome trust me you wont waste your time. (Also theres so many characters so the replayability is outstanding!)"
29006,Sweet memories!
29007,love tis behemoth game
29008,This game runs better than Stephen Hawking.

29016,Good game. Fun to play with friends and on own. <-- (mostly wut i do 'cuase some ppl dont have friends) I like the gameplay and there is kind of a story in the game somewhere but its good that way. I recomend playing with a controler just because the keyboard controls are a bit strange for me. Overall good game and play it :) worth buying

29019,"One of the first games I bought on Steam. A game totally worth buying and playing. Great Co-Op game mode and love the mini-games like Back Off Barbarian and All You Can Quaff. The solo mode is also enjoyable by unlocking pets. One of my favourite games I've ever played :) 

Hope you enjoy the game and have fun!"
29020,Fun 4 player beat 'em up. killed by sister in every level at least once.
29021,How can you not love this game!
29022,I love this game <3
29023,THIS IS BALLER AF
29024,yeah you should get it because its a quick 15 buck game that'll get you more than 15 hrs of gameplay. unlocking all of the chars can be tedious but i find it to be entertaining.
29025,cool
29026,"This is one of the best 2D beat 'em up game! Been replaying this game over 8 time to unlock the characters(Explains my over 100 hours spent playing this game), which might feel a bit of repetitive, but each character have different abilities so it does mix things up. Still, beating insane mode, play arena mode and unlocking everything is still on my list of to do's. The new mini game was fun(B.O.B.), it takes a lot of quick reaction and concentration. The mutiplayer was great, joining a random party online and beating the boss down to the ground, ah, good times! So my final rating is 9.5/10, unlocking characters are tedious as you need to replay the game again, but still ton of fun with friends. If you want a challege try insane mode, I only beat till the forest level."
29027,Great Fun!!! :D
29028,"Buy this game, buy all the DLCs. If you like fun beat'em ups with a fun story then you won't regret it."

29057,"Castle Crashers is a 2D side scrolling beat-em up created by Behemoth Studios.

Castle Crashers is a simple, yet addictive game about traversing a land and killing monsters to save four princesses. In short, it sounds like your generic medieval game and, to an extent that's what it is. 

Until you factor in getting weapons from a giant frog, and having green ""poison"" come out of your characters. 
Castle Crashers has four upgrade paths - Agility, Defense, Strength + Magic. All of these abilities are good to upgrade, but the path that really shines is Magic. Magic is, arguably, the most powerful boss-slaying attack in the game, to the point of being able to drop high level bosses in a matter of seconds. Every four upgrades you get another magic ability.

A typical Castle Crashers playthrough will last about ~6 hours, give or take. A normal playthrough while all alone is pretty boring, to be honest.

Where Castle Crashers really shines is with friends. The game is amazing when played with a group of friends. The multiplayer, is a little shaky however. Plenty of issues with lag can deter someone from finishing (or even starting) a playthrough. If all of the players have good connections, expect to have little to no issues and a great time with friends. Playing with friends also brings more enemies, calling for a greater challenge.

After beating Castle Crashers' story, you can begin Insane Mode which is the story, with beefed up enemies. This is where the game gets difficult. Insane Mode can be a real trouble, but with enough motivation is a great treat to complete.

Castle Crashers is a fun game, and while I don't play it all the time it is fun when me and my friends get on it.

29073,OMG....Better than tf2...AAAAAAWWWSSSOOOOOMMEE
29074,more like crashed my enthusiasm
29075,"So, here I am, writing another review.
Castle Crashers is a 4-player coop side-scrolling 2.5d brawler game, cooked up by The Behemoth, ex-newgrounders and creators of Battleblock Theater. 

You play as a knight (or one of the many unlockable characters, ranging from skeletons and fire demons to aliens and ninja pirates), sent out by the somewhat cowardly king to rescue his 4 daughters, as well as a magical crystal, which were captured by the Evil Wizard. On your journey you will have to fight your way through hordes of barbarians, polar bears, fishmen and an assortment of other enemies (many of which you can later play as), as well as a number of powerful bosses. You can do this alone, or with up to 3 friends, online or through LAN. Then, if you complete the campaign, you can enter Insane Mode - essentially a repeat of the campaign, but with new weapons (also, all the enemies' stats are multiplied by 10). 

Finally, there's several multiplayer modes, such as Arena (which is actually a number of different competitive gamemodes, most of which feature you beating up your friends), or All You can Quaff (in which you have to eat a number of different foods faster than your friends do).

In short, a really fun game to play with your friends.
I rate this 9/10 (one point deduction because the characters are somewhat unblanced)"
29076,great beat em up game and multiplayer as well
29077,"This FPS is pretty good, other then the toxin online community. I was playing team dethmatch on nuketown and some young kid said he was going to deox me, I don't know what that is. Should I be scared?"
29078,"Ever felt like saving some princesses while fighting through waves of enemies? Do you miss those old beat em up games while they just don't make those anymore? Castle Crashers is all of that and MORE. While you are fighting for true love, the whole kingdom is falling around you. You (and you're friends if you want) will fight through anything and see anything to save your love. As it may be a bit graphic and sometimes completely weird and disgusting, it gives you the classics of an RPG, side-scrollers, and beat em ups, while giving you the mature visual jokes of BattleToads."
29079,"Personally my favorite brawler or beat em up game. It can get repetitive if your shooting for 100% but the game will always be fun to play. It has its own unique style to make it stand out to other beat em ups and has a great leveling up system. It combines Rpg and beat em up gameplay better than any other game I've played and there are tons of familiars, weapons, and characters to unlock. The only real downside for this game will be the lack of people playing it but if your looking for somone to play with you can always friend me."
29080,"Fun to play with friends!!!

29085,i love it............. but then again i beat the game on blue knight and still dont have the guy you unlock with the blue knight
29086,Mostly a button mashing game. Would only recommend if you have friends to play with.
29087,"It's a great game for co-op with fun animation and tons of humour.
Recommend it!"
29088,its a good game i played it on xbox i love it

29092,One of the best games that I have ever played. I bought this game on a whim because my friends played it and it turned out that it is a very good game. it can be a bit repetitive alone but with friends it is amazing.

29093,Still best Hack/Slash I ever played
29094,"Great game, sucks on pc doe. Get a controller madafaka!"
29095,button mashing at its finest

29119,This is an AMAZING game. This is coming from a guy who dosen't typiclly like games like this
29120,"This game is amazing! The Beat-Em-Up Genre is pretty cool in general, but this game just blows it out of the water! It has a lot of unique and fun characters, the DLC is pretty cheap at only $1 for the Blacksmith and another dollar for the Pink Knight. It has a lot of re-playability since it has so many characters, you can try to get all of them to level 99 and you can try to beat Insane Mode with all of them. I have thousands of hours in this game and I have unlocked each character, each are level 99, and all have the Gold Skull, meaning I beat Insane Mode. This game is really good and I suggest that you get this amazing game! It is totally worth the $15, but if you can't spend that much, there's probably a sale on it during Black Friday and Christmas! This game is amazing and I think that if you can afford it, GET IT!!!"
29121,No that fun.
29122,"Love this game, had it on PS3 as well, still awesome. The only thing i dont like is that if you play alone it can get repetitive cuz theyre all the same levels. other than that its super amazing co-op and everything :)"
29123,"I really really really really really really really really really really really like this game....like.....I really really really really really really really really like it. 
"
29124,"It's awesome, you just can't describe it, you have to play it.
Also I really love the PS3 controller support since I don't have any X360 controllers, that's one thing the Behemoth gets right.
(Btw, I'm talking about PS3 controller support on Mac, I'm not sure if the game has got native support for PS3 controllers)"
29125,"To keep this review short this is a humorous game, and one that was well worthy back then. However now a days I honestly wouldn't reccomend buying this for online play since everyone doesn't play this game much if ever, but if you are looking for a new type of game to pass a few hours go ahead.

29138,"From the award-winning independent developer The Behemoth, creators of Alien Hominid HD, now you can experience medieval-style insanity in Castle Crashers."
29139,"This game is so stupidly fun it should be illegal. It's a pretty simple game, fun for 4 players, or fun for only 1. Its the sort of game you can play forever, because there are so many different play styles with all the characters different magic types, and all the different weapons you can get, and the story is just silly. The boss fights are all actually pretty enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this, it is SO worth the $15. I would also recommend the DLC Characters, Pink Knight and the Blacksmith. $0.99 each, really good play style, and 100% of the money goes to charity. How great is that?"
29140,"just buy it. dont ask why.. I SAID DONT ASK.... jeez, the internet nowadays... just get it, i love it."

29144,"I'm not an incredible fan of brawler style games, but this one was worth sinking a few hours into. The style is entertaining and cartoonish. The humour is crass. The bosses are interesting.

29148,"YES! Best game ever! Super funny, totally worth 15 bucks. GET DIS GAME NOW!!!"
29149,"It's fun, having a wide selection of weapons and playable characters. Although it becomes slightly repetitive after some time, you can overcome this problem by playing with friends."
29150,It is a relly good game it can be hard and boring when you dont beat the level after 5 times but it is relly good if you not stuck on a level and you level up and you can chose if you want speed and more damage on your bow or if you want magic you can get higher level so you unlock more ability on magic or you want to get high defence or attack or both.buy it is relly nice to play but one thing they recommend xbox control and key board you don't know the controls
29151,RIP controller
29152,"Great value, great sense of humor and artwork. Reminds me of medievil madness pinball machine, tongue in cheek beat em' up with a modest skill tree.

29163,Shonkey like a donkey
29164,"Just a really fun game! I don't think it could get boring to be honest. It's quite addicting, it has multiplayer as well which is pretty cool. It has the Little Big Planet type of feel to it when moving with your team mates. Only problem there is which is nobody else playing on Castle Crashers. Sadly, the multiplayer seems kind of dead. I wasn't able to find 1 person on the game. I'd prefer to get this if you either want to play alone or play with friends that have it. I recommend it!"
29165,"Very good game for guys who are looking for some hours of fun. I played this game with 2 friends and discovering secrets and progressing the game with them was funny as hell. Main thing you have to have in mind while buying this game it's : THIS GAME IS INDIE 

8/10 indie game :)"
29166,:D
29167,I want have some teammate :)
29168,"Castle Crasher is humorous game that gives a lot of fun for players.

29170,I got all the ladies and all was good
29171,This has got to be one of my favorite games i love castling other peoples crashles.
29172,"I haven't invested much time in this game to make a legitimate review, but since I've already beaten it in multiplayer I guess I can say several things.

Prepare friends to play with. This game is almost unplayable in single player due to its difficulty and you will lose 69% of the fun you'd get in multiplayer. The only thing you can do in single player is pretty much collect weapons and level up, not much replayability either and due to its repetititiveness you will get bored of it pretty quickly.

I recommend 4 players but 2-3 will do. This is literally made for multiplayer. As a multiplayer game, it's pretty good. Not excellent, but good."
29173,All of the yes.
29174,"Honestly my childhood in one game, lots of characters and takes a while to finish. Definitely recommend getting."
29175,Good shit. 60 FPS support. Well optimized. Buy it.
29176,good
29177,"AWESOME GAME! It has some funny (sometimes dirty) jokes in it. The first time i played it was on the PS3 togheter with some friends and it totally rocked! Now i'm back on the PC and it is still as awesome. It does miss a couple of DLC's that the PS3 had and it doesn't take too long to finish this game. But the best part of this game is that you can play with SOOOO many characters that it isn't normal anymore. My favorite character is the ""Blacksmith"". If you're gonna play this and you finished it and you just want more of this game then theres a challenge for you already: ""Finish this with EVERY character possible."" I definitely recommend this game and all i can say is ""Good luck!""

i r8 9.5/10"
29178,"epic game, epic nostalgia, epic fun, i epecically recommend"
29179,fuck my life
29180,"7.5/10

It's a good, okay game but controls are really bad and it just feels like a cheap port. If you really want to play it, either buy a steam controller or buy an Xbox and buy this game again."
29181,this game awesome and pink knight op.
29182,"Spam ""Strong Attack"" Simulator"
29183,"Absolutely great game to jump in co-op with friends, need more games like this in my life!"
29184,You fight with your friend for a kiss.
29185,"At first, I entirely was ready to give this game a bad review. It really has no support for keyboard users. A friend of mine loaned a controller to me so we could play dark souls together, and I thought ""Hey, I have this game"" turned out to be extremely fun and addicting, if you have a controller or not, it is a fun game. I did originally start out just using the PC computer settings like WASD and such, and eventually I got the controller. Entirely worth getting."
29186,"saw an intire forest shitting their guts off
10/10 wouldshit again"
29187,$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$444444
29188,"Solid game. The matchmaking funcitonality is gone now, but you can still make co-op games with your steam friends. I would recommend playing the game with friends, it makes the campaign much easier. I played the whole story solo, and at times it was quite difficult since the game doesn't scale at all for the amount of players playing. The end of the game is pretty good, and the music and art styles are solid. 

Also Stamper for the win!"
29189,A very funny game :3
29190,i once got this game on the xbox 360 i really enjoy it and now it's on pc yea that's great but the Real question comes in will there be Castle Crasher 2?
29191,"After conquering the world as an Alien Hominid, and before washing up upon the shores of Battleblock Theater, there stood a sidescrolling beat-'em-up to rival all others. Castle Crashers is like if you took the Atomic Knights (from early comic book days), mixed it with the old D&D arcade games, and finally let it cool on the animations of Egoraptor. Sound strange? Trust me, it is only grazing the surface of the treasures that await within.

If you haven't already given Behemoth your money, do it now. Not only is it a great single player experience, with four players, it's absolute insanity.

Hands down, one of the best games for parties or otherwise."
29192,"This is a game you cant skip. I recomend using a controler, and I play this more on X-box 360 then on my laptop, and The controls are better for Xbox. It is a fun ga,e and I recomend it very much."
29193,The servers for online multiplayer suck ass
29194,"It's fun, random, surprising, and you grind it as much as you want. After playing it a lot, it does get a tad boring,  but it's still a fun choice to play with friends to kill time and have a laugh whenever someone dies."
29195,BESR GAME EVER!! .....mark...iplier.....
29196,fun sedation
29197,The Behemoth puts out another charming and fun filled adventure in the form of a beat em up this time around. As a fan of both Newgrounds and Behemoth this is a must play for fans of Newgrounds and the Beat em up genre. I'm a sucker for this heheheh
29198,"Fun, short, extremely addictive, beat this 4 times on PS3, and once on computer. Really fun to beat down hordes of aliens, collect all the hidden pets, and unlocking all the characters."
29199,a nice game to play with your friend
29200,"I love this game! It's a fast paced, cartoony beat-em-up. There is absoloutely nothing wrong with that combination. WARNING If your gonna play the game on a keyboard, make WASD Your move keys, your mouse the attack buttons, and Q & E to block and shoot your bow. It makes the game work with a keyboard. 

PS 'Press Start"" means push enter."
29201,HELLUVA GAME
29202,"Good game, lots of fun for a game that presents a good level of difficulty but a great level of fun!"
29203,"A fun romp brilliantly executed.
Excellent Co-Op, rpg system that allows specialisation and a wide variety of weapons, pets and items to use.
Casual but not devoid of depth with quirky humor making fun of the traditional fantasy plot and just cutesy yet adult overall in tone.
If you look for a fun co-op, this is one to be recommended. The execution is brilliant, the boss fights fun and the replayability great."
29204,"great gaem, i play 100000000 hours. good."
29205,The Best Game Ever Fun to play with friends !!!
29206,"I got revived only to be murdered.
10/10 would be tortured again."
29207,"Nice game, but not as great as the steam reviews show it.

I played it co-op with my girlfriend and had lots of fun.
However the gameplay is extremely boring and repetitive. 

The artstyle is great and the game is fun though. Plus there is a lot of content and the game-worlds are nice.
I recomend it strongly for coop but not for single player.
Except for the lovers of brawlers."
29208,This will and always be a great game.
29209,great game super fun even better with friends
29210,"its alot of fun but you should get a Xbox wired controller and dont use apple mac because the xbox controller dosent work on it
"
29211,Possibly the best beat 'em up on the market!
29212,This game was a blast to play with friends! My most found moment was the final areas. Me and my friend came up with this strategy and when it worked we felt like we climbed a mountain. It felt so good and the music by waterflame was perfect for this game! AMAZING!
29213,"Beaten the whole game just to marry a clown .

10/10"
29214,Good
29215,"I love the stupid sence of humor and the colorful background. the grinding is even more fun than in other games because the enemies are always fun to beat up. this still is a tough game and if you dont have experience with games like this you will get your butt whooped but still go get it right now!
"
29216,"Awesome action platformer. The best one on PC platform. I played most of the game solo and still enjoyed it. But with friends it's whole new level of fun. If you like those classic arcade beat 'em up games from your childhood, you will love this one."
29217,Out here like the Genghis Khan slaying infidels and collecting hoes
29218,"This game requires : Good skill 
                                 Bit of friends

This game is really good cuz its really good coop game ( you can play it solo but its not fun )
It has crazy as shit story and allso things you can do
But you can win it in less than 10 hours

29219,this game is awesome

29224,Finished with two mates in about 6 hours - great fun.
29225,yes
29226,its fun
29227,Probably one of my favorite games. Highly reccomended to anyone that enjoys Beat 'Em Up's.
29228,"Castle Crashers... one of the best games ever made, I'd say. Definately in my top 10 list, but not quite inside the 1-3's. Anyways, this game is very easy to understand. You kill things. Get XP. Level up. Use magic. Fight Bosses. Die during bosses. Rinse & repeat. I may be a TF2 player (and like only play TF2) but when I'm bored, this game is always there, sitting in my library waiting to be played. And it's not alone.


The Behemoth is another thing about this game. They created my ALL-TIME FAVORITE GAME, Battleblock Theatre! The thing that makes me like their tiny variety of games (3, believe it or not) is because of the crude humor & really stupid storyline. And the art style!!! Don't forget the art style!!!


My overall rating?

29229,Best game in years
29230,its an ok game
29231,Awsome Funny

29236,this is a prity nice game
29237,Very fun game when played with friends
29238,"Castle Crashers is a fun indie game that really showcases a new side of multiplayer fun.

Humor works throughout the game

29250,An excellent and hilarious game that is fun played alone and even better played co-op with friends. Much better to play with an xbox controller if you have one but still a good experience when played with a keyboard and mouse.

29256,Fun to play with others.
29257,It's a very good game and a lot of fun. However it does lag whenever I play online. I constantly drop 30-40 fps whenever I play online with no reason
29258,"This is one of the funnest co-op games I have ever played. You can button-mash your way through many enemies with various swords and magical abilities. Having friends makes this even more fun. The story is minimal, but the gameplay more than makes up for it. The music is great and the hard mode makes this normally casual game a real challenge."
29259,ITS WELL GOOD INNIT
29260,I'm da pickle
29261,Best Game EVer
29262,"The game is good, but having only Xbox button prompts is confusing at times."
29263,"This one took a lot longer than I expected it to (not because of time spent in game however). Let’s get this rolling.

I – Story [8/10]

Castle Crashers is a 2D, Beat ‘Em Up RPG from The Behemoth. The player can (initially) choose to play as one of four knights. While attending a party at the King’s castle, a dark wizard arrives and steals a mystical gem along with four princesses. The King sends the player on a quest to retrieve the gem, the princesses, and to defeat the dark wizard and his henchmen. The story is simplistic, yes, but it it sets the tone for an amazing journey for the player (and for the player’s companions if the player chooses to bring friends).

II – UI [10/10]

The user interface in CC is great for the genre. Much like the beat’em up games of yore, your health (and mana) bar is located at the top of the screen and you can always see what level it’s at. There’s also a little orb next to it that shows you what item you currently have selected, which is nice. No minimap is necessary here as the levels are very linear and you can only go one way: forward.

III – Gameplay [10/10]

Gameplay in CC is just great and it’s a blast to play with friends. The control scheme is very basic; you can attack, block, jump, make out with princesses, kill your friends so that you can be the one to make out with said princesses, use magic and items, etc. There’s not much to it and that is perfectly fine. I don’t honestly know what else to say on the subject.

IV – Content [10/10]

Castle Crashers has a fairly large amount of content. There are four playable characters initially (this number can go up if you own other games from The Behemoth). From there, you can unlock a ton of extra characters (including two that come from DLC packs.) There is a smattering of weapons from which you can select, all while prancing about in the belly of an antlered toad. Magic is (generally) different for each character and you can pick from a whole herd of animal orbs to accompany you in your quest.

There are a good number of different areas in the game and each has their own enemies and boss battles. It’s a great time and you won’t be getting bored of this one any time soon.

V – Visual [10/10]

The artwork in CC is amazing; I love it. The game may be cartoonish, but it is in no way a child’s game. Enemies who fall to your blade will often lose limbs (or heads) and crumple to the ground in a torrent of blood. Think Mortal Kombat. Okay, not quite that extreme in the gore sector, but still. You get the point. 

VI – Audio [10/10]

For better fitting quest music you could not ask. CC has you covered when it comes to triumphant overtures to complement your heroic deeds. Honestly though, even if you don’t end up getting the game, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of the soundtrack.

VII – Overall [9.7/10]

Overall, Castle Crashers is one of the better games of it’s genre on the market. It may be a few years older, but that doesn’t mean it can’t still compete with the new kids on the block."
29264,What can I say about this game other then that IT'S AWESOME! I play a lot of game's and this is one that i alway's go back to. If your a hardcore MLG pro gamer or just a casual gamer this is for YOU!
29265,"Funny, lots of detail. Not sure about the 15 dollar price tag (I got it on sale) - it's not exactly my cup of tea, but it seems really well done."
29266,the game is absolute shit not worth the hassle of being spammed attacks and then dieing
29267,This Game is amazing!!!!!!
29268,Really addicting game. You'd think that having to play through the game more than once to unlock more characters would get boring. but it really isn't. It always manages to challenge you and keep you engaged.
29269,only problem is... THERE IS NO DLC FOR MORE STORY I WANT MOAAAAAAAR
29270,Very nice game ... 11/10
29271,"very fun
"
29272,"This is a fun 2d arcade hack and slash action game. I can only comment on single player. The single player game took me 8 hours to finish after that you unlock an 'insane' mode and some special weapons for this mode. Nice cartoony graphics and a good 'adrenaline pumping' soundtrack.
This plays perfectly with an Xbox 360 controller.
The game also supports 2560*1080 resolution."
29273,this game is non stop fun for anyone!
29274,"This game EVOLUTIONAN...NIZ...E.. ES.... gaming for a new rupublican, a new future!!! A NEW WORLD!!!!! GET THIS GAME AND BECOME IMENSLY CONFIGURED TO THE REALM OF THE MAD GOD, IF YOU DON'T THEN SUFFER THE ETERNAL PUNISHING THROUGHOUT YOUR FAMILY FOR THE NEXT CENTURIES AHEAD!! HERE AWAITS A NEW GAME.... A NEW FUTURE!!! O WAIT!!! I ALREADY SAID THAT!!! GOODBYE!"
29275,"This game always become one of my favorite adventure and beat'em up game. 
Worth to buy this game. Why? Because :
+ Online multiplayer : You can colaborate with your friends and reach the victory!
+ At the beginning, there were only 4 characters, if you already reach harder/higher levels, you'll get more UNLOCKABLE CHARACTERS!
+ Lots of weapons and animal orbs!
+ Arena and All You Can Quaff mode! Way to train your fighting skills and play with your friends for fun!
+ Level up system and lots of combos that you can deal with your enemies!

And you can get your first virtual kiss with your love! :p #singleonly

29276,Hilarious beat 'em up side scroller with hours of fun for four friends. Never had more fun decapitating my friend for a kiss.
29277,Great game. Lots of fun.
29278,Arcade-style beat'em up multiplayer game that never gets bored. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS.
29279,"One of the most iconic games in Behemoth's category and was a huge smash hit back in the day on xbox live arcade, Castle Crashers is full of a lot of humor and overall sillyness that'll make you giggle time and time again. 

The shallow combat system is easily forgivable due to the endless site gags, banging soundtrack, satisfying weapon/pet collection system and adorable sprite work. There is never a dull moment in this game, especially with a full team of your friends to tag along with you.

I've spent many hours of my life playing this game with my friends on the Xbox 360, and then even more by myself when it came out on the PS3, then some on the PC now.

One of the greatest side scrolling beat 'em ups to have ever come out to date, and still one of the best indie games out there."
29280,Gud gaem 9/11
29281,U cresh cestlez end u keel da bad peepol.
29282,not so good when you get started but when you get in to the game one of the Best (And get the cant stop laffing buldle)

29287,6/5
29288,"Go to school. Open Castle Crasher, everyone plugs in controller. You have so much fun."
29289,IT is one of the most epic and exiting games i have ever played on my opinion the best game you can play with friends. It is a beat em up mixed with an rpg and totally kicks ass
29290,Great fun with friends :D
29291,"One of, if not the best Co-op indie games money can buy. I played this game first on xbox 360 and had a blast, got the PC port to play with friends and it was amazing. 10/10

When it goes on sale, get a 4 pack, give the extra copies to your friends. You won't regret it."
29292,"my parents divorced the day i got this game

but its ironically k"
29293,Great game
29294,I really Love this game:)
29295,"this game is quite fun. i got it cheap in last steam sale and it's quite great game.
PRO
+ it's funny, simple gameplay
+ 2D graphic, great though
+ multiplayer, can be played on same PC or with other user via internet
+ a lot of hidden weapon and pets throughout the game that can only be obtained with > 1 playthrough
CONS
+ quite short story. 9-10 hours for first playthrough
+ will be quite boring if you play second time/third time.. so on because the story is exactly the same

CONCLUSION is this is still a great game especially for multiplayer play, and if you can get it cheap don't hesitate to buy this game."
29296,Castle Crashers has to be one of the most unique games I have ever played. Its hard to compare it to anything because there is nothing really close to being similar to this game. Its an RPG side-scrolling arcade styled game thats really easy to enjoy by yourself but even better with some friends online or split-screen! This game is highly recommended for people that are trying to dig into a killer co-op game!
29297,its cool
29298,"Became a Pink Knight. Killed a bunch of people with an oversized lollipop. Stunned people with rainbows.

29299,cute :*
29300,Awesome game i recomnded to anyone who love hackn'slash games
29301,"i have noone to play with, 10/10."
29302,nice
29303,"Good game with delicious music and graphics, found minimal bugs and no crashes. 10/10"
29304,"[h1]Brought to you by [i]The Behemoth[/i] development crew, [i]Castle Crashers[/i] is a four-player hack ‘n’ slash three-dimensional side-scrolling title that rivals and is reminiscent of [i]Dungeons and Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara[/i]…well, if it held a different tone. [I]Castle Crashers[/i] retains a resonance with the cast of the game, featuring the likes of Dan Paladin, Will Stamper, and several others, and mashes comedy into the classic ‘your princess is in another castle’ story arch. This title features four base knights-green, blue, red, and orange-with varying powers, and adds Hatty Hattington to the roster if you own [i]BattleBlock Theater[/i] for Steam; there are also twenty other unlockable characters as well as two purchasable knights, but I will speak further on the said two in a later section. [/h1]

Here are a few things that I find interesting about [i]Castle Crashers[/i]:

Leveling System - Players have to put in some work to level up, as experience is granted based more-so on enemies routed and hits connected than overall damage done. What I love about this take on level-ups is that it blends well with the player-versus-player elements, and allows the more tenacious ‘crashers’ to gain levels more frequently than those attempting to preserve health; the player-versus-player aspect will be explained in further detail next. As an individual knight gains a level, he has the opportunity to allot a gen number of points into four different traits: Strength, to determine the power of the knight’s attacks; Magic, which improves the knight’s magic attack maneuvers, spell effectiveness, and how much energy a spell utilizes on cast based on the total amount of energy; Defense, which dictates the knight’s health point total; and Speed, which determines how much damage the Bow item deals with each strike and, obviously enough, the individual knight’s movement. Combined with varying statistic-altering weapons, items, and pets, this leveling system permits players to create their own form of strategy.

[i]Forced[/i] Player-Versus-Player - [i]Castle Crashers[/i] is a cooperative experience, so what could it possibly mean to ‘force’ players to combat against each other? At the end of each stage resulting in the liberation of a princess, only one knight may earn the kiss of valiance from the fair maiden. To effectively decide who is chosen, the players duke it out with all of their acquired abilities and equipment. Unlike most things in this title, a princess’ kiss does not grant any boons, bonuses, or additional equipment; however, it is very satisfying viewing the ‘saltiness’ on friends’ faces when you have stolen the embrace from their colored princess.

Minigames - With various landscapes and degrees of difficulty between the stages, the campaign offers an abundance of cooperative play. But minigames are available to sweeten the deal. I must admit that I have not played too many of them, but the few that I have experienced-like beach volleyball-were so much fun to play with friends and online, win or lose.

Humor - Simply put, from its theme to its plot twists and cutscenes, [i]Castle Crashers[/i] is a title that will provoke, at the very least, a snicker. I feel as though I should refrain from revealing too much from this engaging title’s comedy approach as it is very well written. It can also be humorous when played with friends even at points when it is not necessarily meant to be; this is enhanced through splitscreen play.

TL:DR - [i]Castle Crashers[/i] is highly enjoyable, especially for fanatics of hack ‘n’ slash and cooperative titles, character leveling and building, and of [i]The Behemoth’s[/i] previous title, [i]BattleBlock Theater[/i]; speaking of, I also recommend-if you do not already own both games-the purchase of the bundle featuring [i]Castle Crashers[/i] and [i]BattleBlock Theater[/i]. I would also recommend the purchase of the Pink Knight and the Blacksmith downloadable content since proceeds are given to various charities. Whether solo or in cooperative play, with [i]BattleBlock Theater[/i] and the downloadable content or not, [i]Castle Crashers[/i] is a laughably good time. I had wanted to mention other notable features in this title such as its outstanding level design and themes, gameplay, and specific items but I feel as though I would be continuing on for days if I started. On a side note, I would like to mention that I will gladly play with anyone that owns this title or others. Simply add me on Steam and post the reason why you plan to add me on my profile. Thanks for reading.

29305,"An amazing game. Of all of Behemoth's awesome games, this one is by far my favourite. Combines fun yet challenging gameplay, indirect jokes, good storyline, this is a game anyone can enjoy. Absolutely worth every cent."
29306,"in which other game can you ride a deer with explosive diarrhea through a saw mill while eing chased by a weird troll thing? no other game offers this experience.

instant classic, 6 broccoli swords out of 5 ham sticks."
29307,10/10 would crash castles again
29308,This is a fun casual game that is best played with friends. To really dive in and have a good time you should play this with 3 of your friends. This is a fun game that i would highly recommend buying. well worth my $15.00. The one downside is that sometimes you cant see your character.
29309,"Castle Crashers is an awesome game, only made better by the fact that it's made for multiplayer. Get a few friends, and let the action roll out."
29310,This game is very fun to play you never run out of stuff to do!
29311,"killing hundreds apon hundreds of trolls in front of their mother is great fun, just like making out with the princesses.

also, jumping then spamming light attack, heavy attack (x2), repeat for some reason lets you fly when done correctly. Which makes way too much sense for me not to proclaim it to the world.

this game's story line makes no sense at all, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

[b] spoiler below this text, be warned and all that stuff. [/b]
[spoiler] [i] the ending is also pretty much just the best. The final boss fight makes absolutely no sense, and finding out that very last princess you save is a magical clown thing (which apparently only you didn't know, as all the people around you at the time of the discovery just don't care) made me laugh so hard I sneezed, which is the only time thats ever happened. [/i] [/spoiler]"
29312,"Really good game and very addictive, even tho sometimes the arrows from the thiefs are really annoying. Good multiplayer mode and a good argument. Also really cool weps."

29314,best game ever thats all i have to say
29315,"Played it through with some friends at a lan event. 
70% of the time I didn't know what the hell was happening on my screen but it was definitely fun, cheap too (sales)."
29316,"this game lives up to its name at the end
10/10 would crash castles again"
29317,OMG BEST GAME EVER i remember playing this as a kid on my xbox 360 and like 5years later i was looking around on steam and i was like OMG THEY HAVE CASTLE CRASHERS FOR PC and it is even better than i remember so i say this game is a 10%10 you should deftaley buy this game

29321,"Very fun beat 'em up game with plenty of unlockable characters and some fun humour. Variety of weapons, magic, items, and enemies makes it even more enjoyable to play through.

29322,"A really awesome game, full of fun, especially if joined with friends."
29323,Ever played battleblock theatre? Who cares? no matter what genre of game you like to play castle crashers will not fail to make up for the money you spent on it with a story line more thrilling than 50 shades of grey you will have a blast playing this.
29324,a fun game but i would say the game is good but it gets quite repettive so it rellies on more of the expirence with your friends
29325,"Was about to get the purple princess, I have almost max defense and good magic so I was probably the most unkillable member of the party, 2 friends are dead, was about to kill the other one when I got kicked by another friend who was hosting the game, proceed to call them all C***s, rage happens. Never played this game since. (Hope to change that soon.) Negative Infinity/0. Best Indie Game."

29337,"Just ""DAFT"" money well spent:)"
29338,"Castle Crashers is an entertaining Beat-Em-Up style game  filled with witty humor and a very comical atmosphere. 



I don't think I can review this game past "" I just power farted on an enemy and a bear rocket-pooped into space"".
Castle Crashers is a classic, and a must have for any gaming library. With multiplayer compatability and a plethora of unique playable characters, I'd say it's a cut above the rest. The developers obviously had fun and this translates well within the game."
29339,"Ok, so I only play a little ha who am I kidding I play a lot of this game and I love it theres only a little problem in my opinion and it's not that big of a deal enough for me to even mention it. This game is fun, funny, cool, epic, and amazing all in one. There needs to be more games like this rather then zombie survival games on steam games with I don't know originality maybe."
29340,"Really fun to play with friends. If you have someone to play with, definate good buy"

29349,"[u][b]-Quick Review-[/b][/u]
Castle Crashers is a side scrolling Beat 'em up developed by The Behemoth [i](A developer I'm falling deeper in love with)[/i] and released in 2012. 


[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]
[b]Story:[/b] Castle Crashers takes place in a cartoon Middle Ages universe. The knights are sitting around a table eating a feast, but suddenly an evil wizard steals a large gem, and runs off with four princesses! Being a knight, it is your noble duty to save the princesses, the kingdom, and retrieve the stolen gem.
Queue Adventure!
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=507999966

[b]Gameplay:[/b] The Castle Crashers recommends you use a controller, when you first launch the game. Anyone who knows me; knows I'm stubborn and refuse to purchase a controller for my computer. So... regarding the controller suggestion: Yes, it would be much easier on your progressing-carpal-tunnel. But, the game is completely doable with just a keyboard. [i](It's worth noting that the game key prompts on the menu and in game are actually for a controller; but again, you just get used to it)[/i]
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=507997046
The controls are pretty basic you have three types of attacks: light attack, heavy attack, and throw item. [i](you can unlock and use different combos between jumping, quick attacks, and heavy attacks)[/i] You also have a block button that slows you down, but if you time it correctly, it can literally save your character's life.
As you progress through the game your character will gain experience points, money, animal orbs, and new weapons that you can purchase or will randomly drop off enemies. Your unlockables are accessible at the Blacksmith, and there are plenty of things to collect to keep you busy.

[b]Achievements:[/b] There are 12 achievements in Castle Crashers, this is one of those games that is relatively easier to get 100%. However, four of these achievements require playing with at least one other player. One achievement requires being in a four player game.
There are only two achievements worth warning/note: Arena Master (Win 40 Arena Online Matches) and Glork (Win 20 All you can Quaff Online Matches). I won't lie, to earn these achievements, I ran between two computers. My brother was nice enough to be a punching bag, when he was away at work or school.
Alternative strategy: Hit the fourms and see if anyone wants to trade off, you could do something else while you get beat up... …..likeeee Battle block Theater! [i]link at bottom. :P[/i]

[b]Price:[/b] Castle Crashers is priced at $14.99, for the amount of time you'll spend playing this game on your own, and with friends, that's a fair price. However if you're the first of your friends to play this game [i](unlikely... but who knows, maybe it's possible?)[/i] you should grab the 4-pack so you can play with 3 other friends. [i](Trust me, the game is even more fun with a friend)[/i]

[b]Conclusion:[/b] Story: Pretty stereo typical story line, but it's delivered hilariously and without any voiced/text narrative [i](bonus points)[/i] and with plenty of humor. Gameplay: Suggested controller, but doable with a keyboard alone, I won't pay for carpal tunnel treatment. Shush! Achievements: Fairly obtainable 100% without too much of a time commitment, but you will need another friend or three. Price: Fair, better with a sale, or buying a bundle deal on sale.
All in all, this game appeals to anyone who might have enjoyed playing an arcade styled game, indie platformers, 2D, indie graphics, 4 player games, or just wants to support The Behemoth.

Edit/Update August 28, 2015:
Spell checking, Thanks Angfucious! (Me sp3lling R terre-bull)"
29350,There is one word I need to describe this game. awesome
29351,mother of god yes just yes this game is so so so so so so so so so so SO AMAZING! if i could recommend it 90 times i'd do it 100
29352,"I have loved this game ever since I got it, great to play on your own and even better with friends. I always find myself coming back to this game to play more and it never gets boring."
29353,"This game is the bomb, fun as solo, better with a friend, even better with three friends, and best with 4 flipping friends as you run around slaughtering a variety of enemies left and right in numerous ways, and when you get tired of working together than go to the arena and cut off your friends head or have an eating competition to see which one of you is the fattest. Over-all it a great game and I've played through it dozens of times. One HUGE thing that I personally like is it makes the levels fun to play through multiple times so when you realize that you forgot a secret in a level  you don't tell yourself CRUD NOT AGAIN. Also don't worry about the dlc's too much they will give you an extra character and swords but you get all the level with the purchase of the game, so yeah buy it."
29354,"This game is such a throw back to 7 years ago. This game has a good story, fun gameplay and much more!"
29355,"really fun and a amazing game to play with your friends
"
29356,Cool Game!
29357,another one of the best games i have ever played in my life
29358,"Originally bought this on xbox,but Completed it so i thought let's try it on PC.Castle crashers is honestly a one of a kind,phenomonal game.It provides hours upon days of fun."
29359,This is my favorite game i play it alot! :D thank you steam and castle crashers for this amazing game!

29366,XXYY: The Video Game
29367,"I received Castle Crashers as a gift from an old friend some years ago, and didn’t get around to finishing it until just yesterday. Its a 90s-style beat-em-up for up to four player coop both local and online, originally featured on Xbox Live Arcade before finding its true home here on PC. While they recommend that you use an Xbox controller, I can safely say that using a keyboard is much more responsive and in the long run will save you some frustration. Combat is fast and frenetic and you can quickly find yourself stunlocked into oblivion, so it is important to learn the game’s exceedingly simple but egregiously spamable combos so that you screw over your enemies harder then they could ever do to you. It’s also one of those games where ordinary packs of enemies are more dangerous then bosses, mostly due to their numbers and worse, a lack of mook chivalry- everything that can attack you at once, WILL attack you at once. I believe I initially left off of the campaign out of frustration over its apparent difficulty, though I now understand that what I thought was legitimate challenge was really just a lot of cheap bullshit, which I was able to overcome by cheesing the game right back. That said, I enjoyed Castle Crashers’ bizarre art style, colorful palette and responsive controls, as well as its rather large range of characters and weapons. I completed a playthrough as the green knight with a focus on strength and defense, which proved a reltively safe and reliable approach. There is a dizzying lineup of unlockable characters, some of which require at least two playthroughs to acquire. While readily enjoyable alone once one learns how to play, Castle Crashers is an experience best shared with others in coop multiplayer."
29368,"Fun game. Great for multiplayer,"
29369,Best co-op party game ever
29370,well i haven't played to much yet but id say i like this game the my only minor problem is that the online is vary laggy
29371,"this is a great game to kill a few hours on 
gets boring after a few sessions 
but its super cheap on sale and a whole lot better with a group of friends"
29372,10/10 would Ride a shitting deer again!
29373,"Always loved Castle Crashers on the 360, so now I'm spam grinding here on Steam! :D

WOO! CULTIST FTW! :D ^^"
29374,Cool game <3
29375,Multiplayer fun non stop!!!!
29376,got this game in '10. yolo swag
29377,"One of the most best games I played before also like the clown part at the end,there`s challenges,many pets to collect and can even choose characters like the alien I rate this 9001/10"
29378,"It's great to play with friends on the same computer. Flashy and fast :) but once you play it through you get tired of it :/ 


8/10"
29379,"It's a fun game for solo players as well as for couch buddies. Fight your way through a pretty long story mode. Or challenge your friends in several arenas. There is even a minigame where you can test your button mashing skills (keyboards beware!).

There are many characters to unlock, but for most of them you have to go through the entire story mode with a specific character, making this ''char hunting'' pretty boring. The ''Hardcore'' mode is also not very fun to play because the enemies just get more hp and attack. In the end it even becomes as good as impossible when you don't have awesome magic. 

But it is still a very cool game. The gameplay is fun and the ''cartoon'' art is very nice. I enjoyed every minute so far (except the hardcore mode). This game is a real ''classic'' which you must have in your inventory.

The humor is amazing and the gameplay feels very smooth and satisying. However if you want to play this on your own (Local). Then this game is far from easy and you will have to face a challenge but it makes it no less fun."
29386,amazing simply amazing.
29387,Adorably violent
29388,"- Play like a Kid
- Kill your friends Just to kiss the ugly princess
- Excellent co-op game
- Green knight

"
29389,"Really really fun single player and multiplayer too, awesome game :D"
29390,Great Game!
29391,Awesome!
29392,"Castle Crashers seeks to give level-based brawler action with heavy multiplayer emphasis and ""comedy"". I can't help but cringe as I use that last word. Firstly, the mechanics are pretty solid and overall smooth. There are some exceptions:
-Vertical movement has the typical brawler problem of being 2x slower than horizontal, making it a chore
-Horizontal jumping doesn't keep enough momentum to feel tight
-Hitboxes feel a bit odd before you're used to them
-No actually good combo strings so attacks feel very basic and repetitive throughout the game

Otherwise, the controls and physics seem to pan out well. The graphical style is...2001 Newgrounds flash game. It's really quite bad and its only saving grace is that there are a few vector layers on each sprite for lights and shadow which flash games hadn't evolved yet. They opted for a more cartoonish storybook feel seemingly to fit the...""c-o-m-e-d-y"" but it falls flat and feels like an excuse to be lazy.

Much of the humor in the game relies on poop, fart, college frat jokes and having women be creepily fought over for kisses...which they have seemingly no say in. The game includes many references to popular culture, which can rub many people the wrong way.

The game does enough to keep things fresh and alive by having many different knights with different powers, which you don't really get to use unless you put points into that special stat (whoops!). There are many findable secrets that include useful pets and weapons.

If you're looking for a couch co-op game with some secrets and difficulty, but don't care too much if it has flat humor and ugly visuals, give Crashers a try you fucking noob."
29393,"Simple story
Smash buttons
Kill enemies
Beat the boss
Make out with the princess
Its this simple concept that makes this game enjoyable, Im finding myself agravated everytime the princess is moved but at the the same time happy that there is more to this game.

Have I mentioned there are poop jokes, cause there are those too."
29394,"Love love love this game. It reminds me of the other ""old school"" 2D games I used to play, and since I like that style, this game was a must. And I would recommend this to anyone else who also enjoys this particular style of game. Not to mention the animation is fun and the knights themselves are simply adorable. HOWEVER, you might want a joystick/controller for this game, as it is a bit harder to play with a mouse, and the keyboard controls do not always match up with what keys the game tells you to use. So that is the only downside, if you do not own a controller. Also, the music has potential to become annoying after a while, but until then, it's not bad. Overall, enjoyable game."

29405,yes
29406,"Castle Crashers is one of the best games ever. Seriously, easily one of my top 10 games of all time. First of all the game play is amazing, basic, fun and easy to master. Secondly the games funny story telling is sold and let you get a good story experience with total mute chatacters! Finally its leveling up aspect and insane mode and 100s of hours of game play. 9.8 out of 10. Would stab barbarians in the face many, many times again.

I used to love newgrounds' games as a 10 year old in the early 2000's though."
29410,This game is just pure gold. Do you buy it? yes.
29411,Great Game!
29412,This game would probably be better if it was on the Xbox or any other system. This game played on the p.c is just confusing because of the game breaking mechanics and controls set up for the Xbox 360. Having to figure out which key is the right trigger and which key is the a button or the right bumper is not worth the frustration you will have because you cant find the start menu. Would not recommend other than on Xbox
29413,"This game is sort of like being trapped in a Sunday cartoon, but one that has been taken over by a peculiar and horribly violent personality. 

I mean that in the best possible way.

The pros:

Flipping hilarious
Interesting character progression
Multiplayer keeps it real once the game gets dry from you being totally maxed out (Like, over 9000 of everything)
Unique looking character models

the cons:
Absolutely ridiculous default key set up. The UI when you begin this game (unless you've got a controller) is pretty darn counterintuitive. I changed the settings for literally every single preset function, and it's still a little stiff. Get a controller.

Simple game. Simple review. Best bought on sale IMO. Enjoy [spoiler] Kissing the clown [spoiler]"
29414,"This is a great game to play with friends. It is fun and is absolutely hilarious. A few times it has frustrated me, but over all it is an adventure and a great game."

29417,Great Game to play with Friends
29418,This Game. OH God I loved every second of it. With some friends by my side I could not stop laughing. even alone its so much fun. I recomend this for if you havein one of those boaring days and you just want somethin stupid to fill that void. ^ῶ^

I have played this game on a console and it's waaaaaay better on the console, I do not recommend this game to anyone, ONLY if you are gonna play single player which is kinda boring if you ask me... I highly recommend this game if you are gonna buy it on the console. 

Edit: 
They released a new patch for some months ago, and now the game plays really smoothly when you play multiplayer and it's really fun, I can now highly recommend this game to anyone

[u] What's Castle Crashers? [/u]

Castle Crashers is a 2d platform indie Beat'm Up game. After playing so many hours of this game on the Xbox 360, I was very happy to see this game made it to steam so I could enjoy the whole experience all over again. I would recommend playing this game with a controller though.


[u] Pros [/u]

[list]
    [*]Amazing Soundtrack
    [*]Loads of replay value 
    [*] You never know where each level will take you, one minutes you'll be fighting each other to kiss a princess the next you'll be running away from a giant troll on a deer that has some bowel problems.
    [*] Enemies are unique and fun to fight.
    [*] 21 boss fights
    [*] RPG level up system
    [*] Animal Orbs & Weapons to collect.
    [*] Rammy is life, Rammy is love.
    [*] Insane mode if you're feeling brave
    [*] Many moments that make you laugh
    [*] Can be played and completed in single player if you prefer but I'd recommend bringing friends for a more enjoyable experience
    [*] The ending is one of the funniest I've ever seen and completely random.
    [*] The most fun coop game I've ever played.
    [*] Lot's of characters to unlock
    [*] Max level of 99
    [*] ""All you can quaff"" a button mashing mini game where you have to eat your food faster than the other players
    [*]  An arena game mode, where you compete in a variety of team and free for all game modes, including melee fights, archery fights, treasure hunting and more.
    [*] When you eat a sandwhich you become massive and really strong
    [*] Lots of different environments to fight in, including a forest, a lava world, the dessert, a snowy mountain, a swamp and many more.
    [*] The price! £10 is a steal! 
    [*] Did I mention you ride a deer that has bowel problems?! I mean, you should buy it just for that.

   [/list]

[u] Final Verdict[/u]

So is this game worth it?  I feel like this is a rather unique game, at least from every game I've personally played and  I've never played something like this, a game where one minute you're fighting ninja pirates and the next you're playing a friendly game of volley ball. Each level felt exciting and new, the bosses were fun, the enemies were unique to each area, the game has a way to make you laugh at the silliest of things. The replay value is incredible, the soundtrack is amazing, the memoires you'll make from the game will stick with you, you'll have so much fun with your friends and you can get all of it for just £10! This game is worth every bit of money you'll spend on it and then some. So grab your friends, kill some barbarians and fight each other for a princess!

[h1] 5/5	[/h1]"
29433,"[h1]Summary (TL;DR)[/h1]
This is by far one of the best purchases I've ever made on Steam.
I'm very pleased with this game, the gameplay is fun, and this game makes you want to play with others.

It's about 6-8 hours of gameplay per character, and there are plenty of characters to choose from.

If this game is on sale, be sure to grab it.
You will not be dissapointed.

10/10"
29434,"this game is the shitaki mushrooms, leard to juggle like clowns and laugh your way to VICTORY!"
29435,"The game is really fun when playing alone. But when you play with others on the same computer it gets better, and then once you play online multiplayer it gets to be the funnest and funniest game ever!!!"
29436,"An amazing beat em' up by The Behemoth! What else could you want? Same crew behind Alien Hominid (plz hd remake), Battle Block Theater and the upcoming Pit People. The game holds up amazing to this day and with the upcoming Remaster, the journey won't be lost forever. 

10/10 Would play Green Knight again."
29437,"is a very fun game to play with friends. can get boring alone, but still a simple yet fun arcade style game
"
29438,AWESOME GAME WITH MULTIPLAYER
29439,"Castle Crashers is so AWESOME that i got adicted to it for a year. It used to be my only game on steam up untill i found out about the summer sale. so if you are reading the reviews because you're unsure about getting it and you happen to stumble across this review i hope that i've inspired you. so what i'm trying to say YOU SHOULD GET IT when it's on sale. just incase you don't like it.
"
29440,"[h1]Best co-op game i ever play[/h1]
I just created a custom category in steam awards nomination for Castle Crasher >_<
I named it the [b]""I Got Your Back""[/b] award, steam award must have category for best coop games and this game should win the award because it's a very good game to spend your time together with your friend or brother/sister."
29441,Its a crazy adventure.
29442,"This game is amazing, and the multiplayer with friend is very fun"
29443,"One of the best indie games on steam.
-fun combat and great soundtrack. 
-Topping it all off with cheesy humor

"
29444,"Playing this with a friend is the best thing ever. If you don't have any friends, then rip"
29445,"Xbox Arcade Classic, Looks and runs better on PC."
29446,"Stuff to do in Castle Crashers:
Slice things
Hit things
Adopt a cute animal
Kill TONS of things
acquire different types of swordds and weapons
Hit things with a lollipop
Take on huge and awesome bosses with your friends
Challenge your friends to duels
Board a UFO
Kiss a Clown
11/10 Good game"
29447,Epic
29448,BUTTON MASHING WAS NEVER FUN UNTIL NOW
29449,"YEAHHH awesome game but bad without friends
"
29450,AWESOME. but kinda short :'(
29451,"I loved this game it was completely worth my money and just a good game no bugs or glitches or crashes for me
"
29452,Awful
29453,Lots of button mashing
29454,its goood
29455,Played the absolute crap out of it on Xbox 360 and it was honestly my favorite Xbox360 arcade game. Keyboard and Mouse controls suck for this game and I just havent gotten around to picking up a 360 wired controller.
29456,It's a fun game to play with your friends; but don't expect epic storytelling.
29457,"Great game, it's probably one of my favorites.
I've played the story at least 30 times, and still not sick of it.

I just personally think it would be amazing if there were more in it, for example, every character having their own story mode and their own weapons they could collect, along with pets.

Also, imagine how much funnier or entertaining this game could be if it had dialouge! I don't think I could handle the comedy! 

Overall, this game is great and very unique, but it would be pretty cool to have more characters and maps in it, for it just straight up feels too short to be worth 15 dollars."
29458,"Castle Crashers is a heap of fun you can have with your friends! 
You can play as different knights with their own unquie abilities, find some cute hidden pets and have them fight with you, hack enemies down with some cool weapons, fight for your friends for the affections of a princess, all with a humourous cartoony charm.

If you've got 3 friends who are willing to battle along with you, I recommend you give it a play!"
29459,"Actually such a mint game so much replayability needs more levels but who can complain about having the greed of coins between your friends
"
29460,Fantastic. Its mindless hack and slash f*ckery but its fun to fiddle around with stats (i.e. maxing out one stat and regretting not putting anything in defense) and unlock more characters.
29461,"This is the most fun coop game ive ever played me and my friends would stay up all night beating the game over and over again to unlock all the characters only to fully restart and do it again!
Then one day my friend said to me they are remastering castle crashers i shat my self.... buy this game you will get 100+ hours out of it."
29462,More in depth than skyrim
29463,I loved this game and still do because this game was an old game I would play with my best friends. ^-^
29464,"It's one of those goofy and fun games that you can have a blast with friends or even single mode lots of unlockable stuff and replay with many characters that will start with diferent stat's and magic types.

It gets hard sometimes but nothing that can be beat as well as it worth it for all the crazy stuff that's going on around the game.

Great co op that you must own."
29465,"Fun 
"
29466,"I used to play this game a long time ago on xbox 360 and ps3. it was so addicting and fun and i played it all the time. but then i accidentally deleted my profile and the game was on it. -____- and i didnt want to pay for it again. but then recently i got steam and i saw it and it stirred up old memories. ah. good times. and hilarious game. get it, you won't be disappointed."
29467,This game is for good lads that just want to have fun on a good night.. it is a game for the bois and it enhances your LadPowers.. Castle Crashers is 11/10 game.. i recommend it for all ages and all Lads.. :)
29468,Very fun party/adventure game to play with friends. Nice artwork and mechanics too. Also check out Behemoth's other games.
29469,"This has to be my favorite game, this game is so much fun!!! I LOVE IT"
29470,good
29471,"this game is unplayable without a controller, and since it has no upside on pc, i would reccomend getting it on PSN or XBOX. but the game itself is fantastic, one of the best beat-em-up's ever"
29472,uh..
29473,I spent so much time playing this game on console that I had to get it on Steam. A great buy that I highly recommend.
29474,Alright for local coop;]
29475,best game ever
29476,AMAZING GAME!
29477,Insanely fun. Great for playing with friends or playing alone.
29478,Ran through this from the couch with a buddy. We cleared in 8 hours playing very leisurly. Great game. Smash. Kill. Repeat.
29479,i like pie
29480,this game is really fun im so addicted now
29481,"Castle Crashers is a competitive co-op beat-em-up by the minds behind Alien Hominid. You and three friends travel throughout the kingdom ruining lives and crashing castles on your stubborn quest to save the princesses. There are tons of landscapes to traverse, weapons and characters to unlock, and princesses to kiss. You can even gain experience and level up your chosen knight. This has to be the best beat-em-up I've played in a long time, even coming close to beating Scott Pilgrim as my favorite. A great time alone, and even better with friends, Castle Crashers isn't getting outta here without a recommendation."
29482,Really fun and enjoyable game!
29483,it is an amazing game and i think everyone who liked the origanal street fighter will love it as well!
29484,One of the best games ive ever played so fun even playing solo
29485,"I bought this after Battleblock Theater and I was not disappointed with Behemoth work once again.
Took 3 friends with me and had a lot of fun!
Recommended!"
29486,This game is one of the best games i ever played. Although the game was short the story was very funny. This game is the definition of adventure and fun. If i were to recommend a random game i would recommend castle crashers
29487,"Great Game so fun, I enjoyed countless hours messing around with my stats and creating seriously overpowered magic characters or strength characters. I went straight out and bought the 2 DLC's and its just added more fun into the game. A great game that Anyone can pick up. I reccomend this Game to anyone from The Button mashing mad man to the methodical and mindful player. Great fun for everyone."
29488,Is gud buy now will give you cake 4 playing.
29489,"Best game ever, beating up enemies but mostly beating up ur friends, i would recommend it 10/10"
29490,"Meh, its a ok 2D game i do like it"
29491,Cant even start the game plz help!!!!!
29492,great fun with great friends :) apart from pierce hes a twat
29493,To Many Cooks
29494,"If Behemoth would add a DLC or even make the game moddible so people can make there own campaigns this would easily be the best beat'em up ive ever played, but as it is right now, its still really good, fun ,and cheerful. After you beat the game tho not much more to do kinda loses its touch and boring, unless u got friends to play with/to play through with u again, other then that its kinda done. If you've never played it before and are looking for a great beat'em up i would recommend this game completely. Final rating 9/10,   It will be 10/10 if Workshop comes to play :D"
29495,"I don't have much playtime in this game right here but I enjoyed every single second of it.
Can't recommend it more. Simply provides so much fun, playing with your friends and online with random people and just having a great time."
29496,"This is one of the best games I've ever played.

Pros:
+ Local game capability and online coop, up to 4 people.
+ A lot of unlockable stuff.
+ Diversity between knights.
+ Humor across the game.
+ Cheap to buy.
+ Bosses are puzzly, some of them are very easy to defeat if you find their weak spot.
+ A lot of unlockables. Some are really hard to find.

Cons:
- Becomes repetitive after some time, there are over 30 playable characters that you unlock and the only difference between them is the magic spells. Once you beat the game once you can beat it any time.
- Not the type of game you play online, but rather the one you play alone or with friends. Doesn't stop you from playing with strangers though.
- Has a lot of grinding involved, the experience system is really bad overall.
- Some playable content is pay-to-use DLC, but the items they provide are only worth using for the first 15 levels at most.

In short, it's definitely a very good game you should try with friends. You will have a good time but don't expect to spend 2000 hours on it."
29497,"You have friends ? No ? Well it`s quite fun. 
You do !? Get yourselves some copies of this godamn supreme coop game and go get some fun like the old days =P"
29498,itz gud
29499,"Ausome game, really fun and entertaining, its even funner on co op, cool and funny weapons and powers and the enemy's are just brilliantly hysterical XD, I recommend This game, Simple controls you only use keys no mouse. I give it a simple 5/12 Weird Playstation Controllers"
29500,"Probably the best game I've ever played. I'm not usually one to play beat em' ups but, this. Was. Amazing. I totally recommend this game for anyone who enjoys a good laugh and likes to slap people around with a pitchfork. 10/10 would play again"
29501,"So, i played this with a friend, we got to the final stage and


***SPOILERS***************************










God damnit he got all the princesses and i only got the last one, the f***ing clown princess. 10/10 would recommend"
29502,i surely do love this gamae as i bought all the DLC to it and i freaked on it for like 5 days :P
29503,20/10 IGN
29504,"This has become one of my favorite games of all time. Every character has (somewhat) the same combos, but have (mostly) different magic. With four different stats to level, you can choose whether to stick to the strength (for sword combos), magic (for the special uses of each character), defense (Raises HP and Def), and agility, for speed and archery.

No, seriously. This game is worth every penny it costs."
29505,"Crazy, adventurous fun! I love the cartoon art style of it and the characters are great. Plus you can play with your friends, what's better than being miniture Knights going around causing destrution? Its really a blast and fun for everyone."
29506,its funny when the deer poops
29507,"Once you spend 10 or so minutes to get your controlls figured out (or if you use a controller but I dont reccomend it) its really fun, get some friends on and your set."
29508,Doesn't work that good on Computer.....
29509,"Castle crashers is insanely good and ticks all the boxes on how to pass as a good game in my mind, it is addictive, funny, action packed... I could go on. Its great fun for you and the gang to jump in and absolutely wreck faces and do it in the words of the boss Jacksepticeye:-""LIKE A BOSS!!!"""
29510,Newground game.
29511,"So much fun, i love the cartoon style."
29512,"Stupidly fun. Tons of replay value. Excellent co-op. The catfish approves with a solid ""MROW!"""
29513,It's a pretty fun action packed game
29514,"I bought the 4-pack so I can play with my friends (which is the only way you'll really have fun) and I never, erver regretted my decision. The story was magnificant, never-ending (at least thats how it felt) and always changing so you'll never get bored. It also had minigames such as all you can quaff and the arena which will get your competitive side showing against your friends. There are a huge variety of characters as you progress but the starting collection is limited, which is one downside. I also got annoyed that the game isnt made for keyboard controls and the keyboard controls it already has are just plain terrible, so you'll have to cutomize it (and memorize it because it show Xbox controls n the screen). But, hey, if you have an Xbox controller and you like it, that's a huge bonus for you! So overall it's an amazing game that can entertain you for weeks or even months!"
29515,"Very good game to play with friends. I note that playing by yourself is fun but can get rather boring. I would recommend gathering a friend""s"". I enjoyed many hours completing this with friends. This game connects you and your friends and isn't  game you can really rage at but just relax and enjoy. Although the game is rather simple and short. It is very fun to chill out and play and there are quite a lot of laughs to get out of the game. I would highly recommend buying this game if your friends can afford it to. I bought it when it was 99p and now its £9.99p so it has changed a lot since the sale but I would still purchase at £9.99p as the game is rather impressive and fun to play."
29516,It sucks and I hate it.
29517,"- Español

Si bien se puede jugar solo, es muchisimo mas entretenido jugarlo con amigos en co-op online. La experiencia es inolvidable.

- English

You can play this  alone, but I'll recommend playing this with friends in online co-op. You won't forget that experience."
29518,I wanna crash her castle. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
29519,Best Game Hoped on a game with 3 other random players and beat the boss...
29520,its fun to play
29521,Fun game with a nice art style and easy gameplay. Best played with friends.

29526,One of the funniest and best games ever made! Collecting level 99 characters and beating insane mode is my hobby. Played this first back in 2009.

29531,"Never gets old

Great to play with friends

10/10

THIS WAS MADE BY NEWGROUNDS!?"
29532,I absolutely Love this game and I have never ever gotten tired from it on the Xbox360 or Pc.
29533,This is a fun beat 'em up game with a classic story line of the evil wizard vs the noble/brave knights who dare defy him. This game is interesting with funny jokes and animals.
29534,"This is a very fun ""beat-em up"" sidescroller. Lots of weapons, fun powers, and many levels. Gameplay is great, multiplayer is fun. 
My biggest gripe about this game is that it gets repetitive very fast and enemies are fustrating in the fact that they are damage sponges. The game isn't overly difficult, but hordes of enemies take an annoyingly long time to plow through."
29535,a true xbox classic remastered for the pc master race. BUY IT ITS WORTH IT
29536,"chased by black stray looking cat with wide eyes accompaned by diarrhea deer is scarier than l4d

comedy 8/10
horror 11/10"
29537,Nice and funny game whiet frinds and have good time :)
29538,"Great game, if you have friends you can make a team of four and if you bought Battle Block Theatre then you can play as Hatty Hatting with his gem sword and there is loads of fun DLC to play with aswell, Of course it's still fun without the DLC hope you enjoy the game 10/10"
29539,"[h1] Pure Fun! [/h1]

Castle Crashers is the best in its genre: a 4-player fun-fest adventure that leaves many memorable times together. The gameplay is light hearted, the controls are very fluid and character progression (attribute increases) are up to each players' discretion and directly correlate to each players' gameplay.

The only negative issue that I felt throughout the game was that there are occasions where the background environment/camera makes it very difficult to see clearly.

Overall, a must-have for any gaming group out there. It's well worth every cent."
29540,"Multiplayer is a little bit delayed, but it's still really good."
29541,Castle Crashers Remastered has been announced.. The excitement inside of me cannot be explained. Every little feature change will make me scream and think back those nostalgic moments unlocking all the characters with my friends! :') BUY THIS GAME NOW.
29542,"Really basic arcade button masher. Some complicated infinite combos, game gets pretty tedious when trying to level up all your characters."
29543,This game is a cool RPG game. it has humor that sometimes can be rude and it has suprises you can get stuff that tyou may have not known about.                                                         The olny bad thing is the game is a loop every time you beat the game you do unlock a new character but you do the game brings you back too the start       but i have too say steam version is better beacuse you can get new stuff eaiser then you would in xbox version    i personally think the game is awsome..............Im sorry if this comment was wrong
29544,"Played as the orange knight and was looking forward to saving my princess. DON'T DO IT. You may want to kiss her but your better off leaving her for someone else. Trust me. 

Well with that out of the way, this game is actually quite fun. You should buy it if you enjoy button mashing, stabbing friends, derp pets, and a funny story with some replayability. 

10/10 Potato approved."
29545,Certified Hood Classic
29546,Alien Hominoid but with swords
29547,Good times playing with friends
29548,"Very fun and addicting game. I know you're doing the same exact thing pretty much every level but if you get some fiends, voice chat, and the game it makes it fun no matter how many times you play."
29549,">Plays Arena with Blake and others
>Hides in the corner of the screen cuz coward
> ???
>Profit

10/10 Would win princess again."
29550,"GUD
"
29551,"This game is a blast to play, and even more fun with your buddies. Hack and slash your way through multiple levels of colorful and hilarious characters and enemies, then play the game again with a different character to experience different abilities and a different experience. Level up your stats, find awesome weapons and helpful animal friends, then claim the ALL THE PRINCESSES AS YOUR OWN.

29554,A magical world where sandwiches make you buffer.
29555,Good game with lots of weapons and characters lots of fun with friends
29556,Very cool.
29557,"I once played this game from 12am-4am straight, with my laptop connected to my TV, controller in hand.

If that doesn't say how much I love this game, then nothing does."
29558,"I first played Castle Crashers when I was about 13 on the 360, and it was my favorite indy game.

It still is.

Castle Crashers is a game that takes everything gret about 90's arcade beat em ups, and gives them a modern twist with levelling, items and a funny story. Controls are great, graphics are fun, music is awesome, characters are all unique. This game is at its core...fun. In every way. Get some friends together, grab some controllers, crack open a few beers, and have at it. This game is a blast. This is one of the few games I recommend buying in a 4 pack, it is that good.

Buy it right now/10."
29559,"so much fun.
i think this is the most awesome games i ever played/
its never get bording

"
29561,"Totally Overrated and NOT funny.
Better you play Battleblock Theater, if you want a great Coop Game. 
Its from the same publisher and soo much better!!
★★★☆☆ 3/5"
29562,"pros:
-Nice story.
-Very funny.
-One of the best game to play with your friends.
-the cartoonish graphics.
-Jokes everywhere.

Cons:
-the game is weird to play without a controler.
-the game is not that funny when you play it alone.

Conclusion:
Castle Crashers is a very funny game with lots of jokes. The controls may not be the best(the controls suck, really the game was made for console) but with some friends this game will occupy you a few hours."
29563,Really fun when playing with friends...
29564,Meah
29565,Great game!!!! Super fun and enjoyable!!!!
29566,"One of the best CO-OP games out there,actually single player is really good too.but CO-OP with friends really takes the cake!The game has good over the top humor,interesting magic,good bosses(and a last one with MILLENIUM final forms),dual for princess mini game that will surely break your friendship xD and a most suddle ending you have ever seen!(that suddleness with be multiplied by thousand if you play first time with your friends),the game may end pretty fast  if you are good enough but this experience surely worth the time and price!

29586,"played the game a lot on xbox 360, got it on steam to play with my better half. We enjoy crashing castles often. The game doesn't ask much of you but offers a deep experience if you care to master it. 

[[PROS]]

ton of unlockables
great art/visuals
occasionally funny
many weapons/levels
great co-op with no split screens
4 people can play on 1 pc
game has some challenge to it but you can always level up more for a difficult level
great leveling system
the characters actually feel unique
tons of great enemies/bosses
some incredible level designs


[[Cons]]


low immersion 

being forced to watch same jokes hurts replayability a little

stats could be clearer

gets a little hectic with full group

a story would be nice, but uncommon to this genre


Get this game if you want to play some local co-op or just relax and hack n slash from time to time, its a fun arcade style game"
29587,"Castle Crashers is an amazing game.
With its 2D style indie bet-em-up, and cute graphics, it has a high replayability value, and has loads of characters to play as.
Love it :)
Great to play with friends :)"
29588,"Hack, slash, and smash your way to save 3 princesses and a lovely clown!"
29589,It's way over-hyped. Meh game-play.

Castle crashers is a hack and slash 2d type game. With amazing hand drawn graphics and gameplay. With 31 playable characters and 81 weapons, you will have a lot of fun with this game!"
29591,"Played this on xbox360 years ago but at that time I needed to sell my xbox 360 to get PS4 and I was sad because I loved this game, now I discovered that exists on PC and Im happy :D

29600,"Such a fun game, brilliant to play with friends, or just to mess about with alone. as it says in the beginning, it's a lot easier to play it with a controler, as the buttons who do shit aren't that clear with the keyboard. 
Buy it, have fun, and kiss the princesses!"

"
29604,"I really like the game but if there is ever a sequil or if it's ever updated, than the PC game should be reworked slightly to fit the PC."
29605,one of the best beat'em up games ever (with sexy princesses)
29606,"This game is fucking boring, even 4 player couch

29625,"Good, very funny game.
Excellent if 4-P.

But there is not public game....."
29626,"Although This is a classic for me, it really seems to be lacking. Lacking of play time, lacking of weapons and perks, the skill tree is lacking. But if you catch it on sale then go ahead and buy it! 




P.S: The reason I don't have much playtime is because someone actually gifted me this game, I have numerous hours on the ps3 verson, I have gone through the co-op story with my brother 7 or so times."
29627,this is amazing wizard takes the kings princeses and gem and only yhe knights can get it back.... pretty cliche right? wrong! aliens can two and peasent and even hatty hattington if u have battle blox theater and you get a castle crasher head if u have castle crashers with battle blox! i bought a controller just so i can play this thx steam!

29629,Its an awesome gameto play with your friends. OR just by yourself. try this game out! Its fun!
29630,"Castle Crashers is an instant classic ""beat 'em up"" game that I will never forget. It has timeless and memorable enemies and bosses, plenty of replayability, an enormous amount of weaponary, combos, and magic attacks, and extremely rewarding in every aspect. It's an old gem that really deserves more attention then it already has. 

If you've played Battle Block Theatre then you should definitely play this (Castle Crashers is what made me get BBT anyhow).

I really loved this game to the end of story mode, and the multiplayer is also tons of fun.
9.5/10, GET IT NOW!"

29639,Funny game and good coop system.
29640,"Pros:
Great Game
Great Music
Very Addicting


Cons:"
29641,"Pretty boring game, as the only thing you have to do through the entire game is spam 3 buttons. It's somehow fun to play with friends, though."
29642,"Awsome game. Origonally played on xbox, PC version is better in my opinion,"
29643,ethan won't let me quit playing QQQQQQQQQQQ
29644,"A rally fun game. It has really cool gameplay that brings back nostalgia, and the graphics are great. But sadly, I have no friends t play it with, and after you play it once, you're probably not gonna play it again."

29646,arrows are useless in this game with no depth perception

29648,"good game
"
29649,Very fun and addicting.
29650,"this game is amazing, hands down one of the funny, yet most seroius game of all, it will give you and your friends a fun time and make you have alot of emotions and also the dlc's are well made and when you compleat the game it will make you want to play it all over but i will admit the game can be hard a times but then thats what makes it fun"
29651,I killed 30 enemies while my friends sit back and collect coins. 210/100
29652,good but there needs to be the king dlc and the necromatic DLC  but overall a great game
29653,Awesome funny Co-op Game.
29654,"Totaly recommand that game. Doesn't cost much and seriously the fun is in there. Just try to make sure you can play with friend as this what is gonna make it really fun!

Totaly recommand!"
29655,"how do you get the secret characters ?
"
29656,good game :)
29657,Great game now gift it to friends :D
29658,"Castle Crashers is a comedic side scroller that consists of rage inducing polar bears, Black nights with light sabers, Giant pissed off cats, a cyclops who gets resurrected and much more weird shit. Along the way you can visit a purple jackle who owns a blacksmith shop and selcet from a vast variety of swords like...broccoli sword...what the fuck. Play as any color midget power ranger( btw all the white people are probably dead :) ). Also tons of poop jokes... for $15.

8/10 broccoli swords"
29659,Cant play it on Win8 please add support
29660,This game is epic. Tons of replay vaule and a great multiplayer experience. :)
29661,"Very fun game solo or multiplayer. In some cases (for example, specific requirements for achievements) its easier to achieve some things in solo as the main menu says the full experience is for a 4 player adventure and honestly its more fun in multiplayer. Anyone can pick up, play and love this game :3 


WARNING: VERY EASY TO BE ADDICTED TO"
29662,"If you are looking for a fun, beat-em-up genre game with a touch of RPG elements this is the perfect game for you."
29663,"AWESOME GAME 
BUY IT
NOW BUY IT U NEED IT
WITHOUT IT U ARE A PERSON WITHOUT A LIFE"
29664,"best game 4 skrubs
"
29665,"Love this game! I finally beat it as the gray knight, and it was super fun! This game has cool characters, cute pets, challenging bosses, and more! What more could you want? I love playing it solo, but its even better with friends! I rate 100/10 and you should buy it!"
29666,"Its a good game overall, but you really do need friends to enjoy it."
29667,"I didn't think i could do it, but i found several ways to annoy my friends in this game."
29668,"Easy to pick up and a load of beat-em-up fun.
Best enjoyed with friends!"
29669,"This game is really fun. Single player is awesome, you will need multi-player for some achievements but if you have no friends who own the game its still fun. One achievement you will need 3 friends to play with you to unlock it."
29670,"This Game has an Awesome sound track and mixes it with insane gameplay. This side scroller combines a beautiful art style with humor and great gameplay mechanics. This game is beautiful to play alone and has alot of replay ability. It is great with friends and can be played with up to 4 players. There are alot of things to unlock in this game such as pets, weapons and characters. Really worth a buy and is really cheap in the steam sale."
29671,The princess is in another castle simulator
29672,"If you are thinking about getting this game like the great and magical shia labeouf once said "" JUST DO IT"". This game will make you feel super gay as in happy of course you will feel strong emotions such as OMG, LMFAO, YOLO, and a strong case of WAIDRNISBAW ( What Am I Doing Right Now I Should Be At Work) feeling! This game basically sums up my whole childhood well minus the neglict, and the beatings of course. Castle Crashers feels and plays like an hd super nes beat em up game with a action RPG/ Invader Zim feel about it. With hours of cute puke in your face bloody violence! spending precious hours of your life collecting animal orbs, charcters, and weapons this game will ruin your....cough cough. I mean will give you hours of stuff to do! who wants to really spend their precious hours of their life with their wife, kids, parents, grandparents, or friends when you could play something that is super totaly awesome blow out your mind and eyes game like this. Don't be the lame guy or gal to skip a gem like this up. you could very well die anywhere from anything at any time, and may never get another chance to play this game so what are you waiting for buy it!!!!!"
29673,"its very fun 
"
29674,Great game!
29675,No.
29676,"A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY GAMER!
I played the game through in 2 days and, a month later, I still play it! The local and online multiplayer are both easy to set up and fun to play. I highly recomend this game to anybody looking for a fast paced, beat 'em up game that never gets old. Also, the art is amazing, and the Devs' sense of humor is too!"
29677,"Castle Crashers is a 4 player co-op brawler. Travel the map to rescue the abducted princesses. Meet quirky characters and then kill them. Unlock an arsenal of crazy weapons like a lobster! Find and adopt animal orbs to boost your stats. Eat a sammich! There are hours of hilarious gameplay, multiple tiers of unlockable characters, and a variety of magic powers to unleash on your foes. 

Castle Crashers is a great game for everyone to play; but don't take my word for it (ba do boomp)!"
29678,Really interesting and well made game. 9/10
29679,Good Game Although Could Be Given Better Graphics But If You And Your Friends Afford It Then It Can Be A Great Experience
29680,Super fun game to play! Great to play with friends online or couch co-op. What else is there to say but hit the buy button and buy it!
29681,"This game is so much fun with friends!
"
29682,Great 4 player side scrolling beat-em up!! offers hours of stress relieving sword fighting fun!
29683,"its good, but it reset, no no like for now"
29684,"Very fun and silly. Gets somewhat repetitive eventually and the combat system gets boring at a point, but the game isnt meant to be taken all that seriosuly. I appreciate it for what it is and it is a fun game to play casually with friends."
29685,it's funny but since it's old not alot of people play online. So it gives you something to do when there's not wifi
29686,"This game is great for everyone! Even for people who have never played side-scrolling beat em ups (Like me) Will still love this game. It for starters has Great Soundtrack and even while fighting has great humor and jokes mixed in. The only problem is the replayability is Low, though for those who want a challenge Insane mode its great. This is one of the best Multiplayer games I have ever played and if you check the site it won many awards that it defidently diserved.    Oh yeah dont forget the Projectile Pooping Dear the flys across the Moon and the Pooping Owl and the Farting Barbarian,,, Thing."
29687,"Great game. Very in deph level up system consisting of 4 categories: Strength, Magic, Defense, and Agility. All of these are extremely necesarry in order to be able to fend off enemies quickly. But you really have to grind the first few levels in order to avoid getting beaten by the more harder foes. The story is pretty good too. It revolves around you and a couple of other knights attempting to save 4 or 5 princesses from an evil king, surprisingly good story, great pacing. The controls are great even when using a keyboard and mouse, but what takes some getting used to is the fact that all of the button prompts are for the Xbox 360 controller, and there's no way to set it for the keyboard and mouse. But besides that, you can play 4-player multiplayer, in the story mode or the All You Can Quaff minigame, which i personally haven't tried yet. All in all, Castle Crashers is a great game. I would highly recommend it to friends. I picked it up during the summer sale for a dollar. But even though the regular price is 15 bucks, it's worth it. Trust me."
29688,i recommend thus game becuase u clash badys left and right
29689,"Castle Crashers is a fun action-adventure beat em' up, where the limit is your health bar.
The gameplay is great, the multiplayer is awesome, and the story isn't half bad either. I mean, the only problem with the gameplay is the hitboxes of enemies, but that's not too annoying except for when you attempt to hit the opponent.]. 
So basically...

Pros
-Good gameplay
-Amusing graphics
-Great cutscenes
-Good online multiplayer

Cons
-Needs more content, such as more unlockables
-I hate the @#$% hitboxes

9.3/10"
29690,"Nice Beat 'em up game. Sad that the multiplayer is so dead meanwhile. Bought it on the steam summer sale. If you try to find and do everything the game can be very big. Even if you finish it and want to level further, there is an insane mode. For everybody who likes hack and slay and level up and grinding things ;D"
29691,"One of the most underknown and underplayed games of all time, this game is about you saving princesses from a evil guy with magic powers and all of his minions.

Despite the fact that it lacks of any depth and the fact that some levels are overly hard (such as the vollyball fight), but it has some extremly good art style and funny, simple and stylistic art that definitly dessserves to be praised. 

80/100"

29693,"Sandwiches make me strong -Heavy from TF2

29694,That`s one of the best co-op games EVER!
29695,"good game, good story, hard as balls"
29696,"Great fun, good game, lots of jokes, memes, and just too many trolls in one level(I'll let you find out which it is). Whenever you exhaust your library of games, this is an amazing way to put yourself out of boredom, with the endless collection of weapons, quest to find all the pets, and more challenging reruns of the whole story, plus a huge load of unlockable characters, and other gamemodes to keep yourself busy! An all-around great pack of fun."
29697,"An incredible hack n' slash with tons of possibilities. One of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a game, and with 36 levels, 84 weapons, 31 characters, 29 pets and 2 modes, how could you go wrong?"
29698,Awsome and classic arcade game play it now
29699,"For its graphical content, this game is an excellent beat-em-up with endless replay value and lots of secrets to discover. None of the characters are boring, and the level design is top-notch. I definitely recommend playing this game."
29700,"just great
"
29701,"Great game with a funny attitude towards everything. Definitely worth the buy. Good time-consumer, and keeps you busy. It also has some strategy put in towards it. 
Loved it. It's a keeper.

29708,"Great game, character's, and an epic adventure!"
29709,"I finally beat the game with a friend, got to kiss the last princess.

Turned out to be a clown princess and started a rave party.

I now have PTSD

11/10 would kiss a clown princess."
29710,no castle crashing involved
29711,"I love the consept of this game and the characters, I recommend you get the DLCs though, just makes the game more fun."

29713,"Do NOT buy this game if you do NOT have or do NOT planning to buy a Xbox 360 game controller and its PC reciever!
Playing with keyboard is almost IMPOSSIBLE! Keyboard layout is horrible! Even if you change keyboard layout!
When you change keyboard layout its still showing Xbox 360 game controller button mapping instead of your keyboard layout! I can't find right buttons!

29714,The castle crashed
29715,10 hours for a dollar and fifty cents? yeah i got my monies worth.
29716,"This game is awsome and in some momments kinda insane, but it's a blast to play. And I recommend it to ""beat them up"" genre lovers."
29717,"Reccomended to play with friends, singleplayer is not only a little boring, but also harder."
29718,this is an amazing game!
29719,100%
29720,9/11 My friends got mad at me for leveling up faster because I knew how to juggle. Gud gam gr8 buy. Worth the $$$.
29721,"not a bad game. just not exactly my cup of tea. that being said still worth it, fun with friends."
29722,So much slice. So much whack. So much fun
29723,Brilliant
29724,Very good game ! it's funny some hidden items have very funny locations and the ending is awesome!! <3 to last princess ;) and the best part is... the game does not have big system recuirements!!
29725,this game is bad. like droping you ice cream and the dog eats it and then therews non left bad.
29726,very good game for more than one player
29727,Only buy this game if you have 3 other friends to play with otherwise you will be solo-ing the entire game...
29728,is rly good
29729,"I want a refund. I was supposed to crash castles, I never got to drive a castle so i never got a chance to crash it."
29730,Fun to play with friends and solo
29731,Super!
29732,The game is very boring....The only skill required is to repidedly push keys on the keyboard. Story line sucks.
29733,"it took me 3 trys to beat the 2 boss, later i upgaded my magic like crazy and beat him within 4 seconds 10/10"
29734,i love it

29736,"Amazing game, hack and slash mixed with awesome juice multiplied by 9000%. Thats what Castle Crashers is. 11/10"
29737,"Its fun with friends, but the major con is the controls are presented as XBOX Controller so you will have a rough time trying to figure out which key is which on your keyboard."
29738,piece of shit. I would rather teabag a paper shredder
29739,"WOW!! These deers can poop 10/10, secret character Hatty ftw"
29740,"I love this game so much.

My friends and I got the game whilst it was on deal because we were bored.

Here's what happened:

1. I chose the Hatty Hattington playermodel (I already owned Battleblock Theater.)
2. His sword which he starts with boosts magical power. Threw it away instantly.
3. Got a sword which decreases magic power but boosts Strength and Defence.
4. Upgraded nothing but Strength and Defence.
5. Killed my friends in arena 'till the point of their sanity being lost.
6. Whenever there was a Princess to be fought for I would be the only man who came out alive.
7. My friends didn't even put up a fight for the Princesses.
8. Got to the end of the game with friends and killed them for final princess.
9. Final Princess was a clown.
10. Got scarred for life.

11/10
"
29741,"Great game in a whole
 good combat
 great adventure
 needs something better for higher levels than ""expert mode"" like more levels

i also found little glitch where the barberian boss gets trapped in the corner and can't fight back."
29742,deez nutz
29743,"castle crashers is epic cool, and very cheap and friendship breaking :D"
29744,"Good game, but it sucks that you nearly have to have a controller to play because all of the in game keys show up xbox styled. 65/100 gameplay -40 of those points if you dont have a controller."
29745,"I love this game, if you haven't played it, it's best to try and play it with others who also haven't tried it yet. Going through it your first time as a group is extremely fun. It's fairly simple and short, but highly replayable, and the little cinematics remain enjoyable, and you may notice something you didn't before while doing another playthrough. It is a pretty button mashy beat-em-up, so if you want gameplay with a lot of variety, this may not be the best choice, Otherwise, hitting x a bunch of times and juggling enemies in the air from one side of the screen to the other remains fun. My only issue is the experience system. You get experience for hitting enemies (except when they've died and you're not letting their corpses rest peacefully), regardless of damage. If you are stronger than the other players, you will level up slower. This sort of inhibits magic users from leveling decently, since you deal high damage in few hits.

If you look at the negative reviews, most of them are people complaining that the game is unplayable on keyboard. I first played the game on Xbox, loved it, eventually got it on PC and still loved it. Recently the A button on my controller got jammed after hours of a little game called Ys Origin...so now I use the keyboard. Guess what? I'm completely fine, the game is still entirely playable, fun, and not really any harder. The people complaining probably just suck...ignore them. The instructions do only show Xbox controls, making you have to test to figure out the controls, but you can map the keys you want to use anyway."
29746,"this game is the most badass thing you will EVER PLAY IN YOUR WHOLE GOT DAYUM LIFE:BILLIONS OF HOURS OF FUN,MULTIPLAYER ARENA,LOCAL CO-OP,ONLIIINE FUN AND MULTIPLAYER,OMG YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (explosions go off in backround, gunfire heard in the distanse, five jets fly into the camera)"
29747,0/10 game doesn't support multiplayer on shared keyboard
29748,"A very nice throw back to the side scrolling beat em up's of the late 80's and 90's.

Decent graphics, great humor and a fair amount of replayability value if you like collecting achievements and characters.

Doesn't take overly long to complete one playthrough and its way more fun with friends.

I definitely recommend this title."
29749,"Pretty Good
"
29750,the game and art style were both amazing it's definitely worth the money.
29751,adada
29752,This game is amazing! one of the few games me and my girlfriend can actually stand playing together
29753,This game is cool !
29754,"Watched an owl, bear and deer shit themselves.

10/10 Bought on PS3 and Steam"
29755,dem memories mayne..
29756,"2 words.

Very. Addicting.

The art elements (which are cartoony) was what attracted me in the first place. However, I didn't expect the gameplay and storyline to be so fun! It's fun to collect weapons and animals, though it's tedious to do so. Pink knight is my ultimate fave because of his/her magic powers! A defo must have in your library. It's a lot more fun to play with friends!"
29757,At this point I don't know anyone that doesn't already own this game on steam lol. But for good reason. This is so much fun to play with a friend! Great combat and fairly easy to learm right away. My only real complaint is that it does start to lag out in the later levels when more mobs are on screen. 4 out of 5 Matt faces.
29758,"I think castle crashers is great!  I personaly give it a A++.  the only problem is sometimes the game is very very very hard to play by yourself and the story is too short, but overall it is great!

"
29759,"This is one of my favorite games! I would recommend this to people with the love of melee, but it's not just melee! My favorite, Magic, and other tools! I won't spoil it too much, so I'll end this review."
29760,amazing game WITH friends
29761,yes yes suuuuuu kool
29762,"This hack and slash game by behemoth is by far, one of the best co-op game I've ever played! Having different weapons to collect and bashing enemies together with your peer is definitely a nice thing to have on a friday night. and don't you forget on those cute round pets helping around with your quests.

I'd say this game is really enjoyable although room for improvements can be found here and there.

if you're into co-op, please do try this game with your friends, even better if you can arrange a gaming night where 2 or more controllers are tucked into your PC and everyone's playing locally."
29763,Solid side-scrolling action with a neat style that provides lots of fun (especially with other people). With a good amount of levels and quite a bit of stuff to discover it also has a decent amount of replayability.
29764,great game :3
29765,This game is amazing and pretty addictiing though I think it needs more people online tbh i love this game and i think it needs more people playing it
29766,"Great title which is way more fun in coop. Graphics are detailed and in a nice cartoon-ish look. A loft of unlocks are waiting. Also, the devs included a new character after releasing their newer game. Amazing!"
29767,"Pros:
1. Great Beat 'em up Gameplay, 
2. Great sense of humor.
3. Variety in gameplay.
4. Amazing Multiplayer.
5. Great Boss Fights.
6. Lots of Unlockables. Characters, Pets and weapons.

Cons:
1. Hard to get money.
2. The levels change from far too easy to too hard in an instant

Conclusion:
Even with some flaws it is a must buy on steam even when you are not into Beat 'em up genre(like i was).
If you are still not sure if you should buy it, The price drops frequently."
29768,Awesome hillarious And Dont Even Mention The End With The Clown Dance Party
29769,It is a fun indie beat em' up and is great to play with friends but is way to easy for other people to hack and for those who do hack never get a backlash like a ban or something and it annoys me as I try hard to get to a high level when other people just gain a level every time they hit an enemy.
29770,I ADDOR THIS GAME!!!!!
29771,"If you're looking for fun Co-op game that you can play with your friends, while you smashing buttons and clearing dungeons with no stress at all, then you've come to the right place. I strongly recommend, it's one of those games where you come back to every once in a while but you end up playing for weeks straight. The controls for PC is alright, but for better experience I'd say playing with controller is better. It's one of the MUST HAVE game for sure."
29772,"I'm building pure magic just for fun and my friend pure melee.

Good times (H)"
29773,"Buen juego un poquito de popo, vomito y adrenalina, la verdad pasar el juego al 100% todo un reto ;)"
29774,Its a  great game to play with your friends and the music fits right ino the scene 7 stars if I could. ('uu')
29775,"Incredible Indie game, tons of fun, but when it says it has ""full controller support"", it means you pretty much NEED to have a controller, unless you want to spend 2 hours fiddling around in the control options to get every key to work halfway decently. Great game, horrid port."
29776,"Enters level
kills enemy
lvls up
beats lvl
ups stats
gets addicted
plays many lvls over
lvls up many times
ups stats many times
realises that final boss sucks
beats game
destroys computer
#win at life

29777,"Absolutely amazing game. An awesome adventure for you and friends to go on together, love playing this with my friend and his little brother. Insane mode is actually really challenging and theres so many characters you can unlock."
29778,"Wonderful Hack and Slash Side-scroller RPG Game with fun levels and good leveling system, the difference between characters is just right to make each one unique, only a few characters have 1 similar magic power (Not counting Clone characters) but the most unique thing is the game itself, show me one other game that is designed similarly to this. 10/10"
29779,very funny game!
29780,"this is a beat-em up game like in the arcades nothing much to say about game play

this game does get a bit tedious but at least it was fun you can play multiplayer online or LAN and upgrade characters ability's customize weapons and characters

the frustrating parts of this game i found extremely often in the arenas especially the volcano arena the A.I spams like in volcano arena they will spam bombs and keep on hitting you when your down then hit you when you get back up it can get annoying as you lose health with no way out

still good but 15$ ugh wait for a sale

7/10"
29781,amazing game! 10/10
29782,castle crashers is a really good game i love the enemies the jokes and the quilty the only thing i think is bad is that almost the only time i get money is at the end of the lvl how am i suuposed to get stof at the insane shop :(...  but in the end i would recemend itand it runs good :).
29783,"Meh, It's a 7/10 For Me Because of the fact that it still has console controls and things on it,"
29784,this game is for people who love to fuck shit up in a beat em the fuck up game
29785,"The world's finest ""Oh my god, my dark ages father is going to kill me for this!"" simulator."
29786,SO fun so many charecter there is always something to complete :D <3
29787,"A great entertainment, very nice to play in local co-op. Remember old arcade games, like Golden Axe, TMNT and others. Is not a great story, inovative gameplay, but is very funny!"
29788,"This game really reminds me of the time when i used to play console games!

I really missed this kind of game. i'm glad that these kind of games still existed!

I'm now pulled back to my childhood once more..
 Thank you for creating this game"
29789,Great with friends. Me and my buddy have put over 15 hours into this game and still never get bored with it. However I do recomend playing with a controller to get the most enjoyment out of this masterpice.
29790,mmmmmmmm
29791,U dont crash castles im dissapointed 0/10
29792,"the game looks very cool but is kinda hard to play on your pc with its weird configures-> looks cool, better get it for a console"
29793,LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH ITS AWESOME
29794,Amazing game! I had so much fun playing this game!
29795,"It is a nice, kid-friendly, feel-good game that made me smile several times. 10/10"
29796,"This game is phenomenal. If I were to chose a game to act as a microcosm for all Indie games, I would definitely choose Castle Crashers! A simple combat game where you hack and slash through NPC's to get to the objectives; this includes a simple yet complex tactics system including combos, magic, and defense, pretty much the retro Indie game combat pack. The game runs smoothly, it isn't graphic intensive and it relatively small! Finally, it also includes a rare feature that not MANY games have, a sense of humor! Hell, my icon is a Castle Crashers figure! Go buy it now."
29797,"It's so cool!!!!
It's like the best game ever with a twist ending!!!!"
29798,Castle Crashers is my favourite game that the Behemonth ever made.
29799,What a game hilarious and fun to play with friends it is a must buy best played with friends
