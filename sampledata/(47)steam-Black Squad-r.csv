16,Old is Gold
17,this fucking game doeasnt even start it lon launch when i hit play button
18,"The game in itself is awesome. The Guns feal really nice to use and there is a good balance. Higher Damage, 1-Tap to the Head Guns have higher Recoil and are harder to use. Laserbeamguns exist but have much lower damage. It can be annoying if a guy with an M4 (Laserbeam) just strafes around while holding Mouse 1 and kills you. But if u Aim better with your Ak-12 you win.
The Graphics are very Simple and definitely outdated which is a Con to some and a Pro to those with a Low-End Pc. 
The Reason i stopped playing Years ago was that after every Match i played my fps would drop by around 20-30 and i couldnt find a fix for it. Today after a long Break i decided to Download the Game again and Check it out. Went for a Warm Up. Game still feels nice fps didnt drop anymore.
The same Guns are still good some new Maps were added and some other Content aswell (Guns,Skins ect.).
 Decided to hop in a Custom Demolition Lobby. After a while a Player Joins and starts wrecking everyone. Some Call him Cheater but from my Fps experience that is pretty normal. I did not make my Judgement yet. Next Map starts he joins again and after a while its pretty clear he is Cheating. To kick him Only his Team can Start the Vote and everyone has to Press Yes so ofc he was not kicked (newer players maybe dont even notice the vote,others are happy for the free win, Idk). After the Match ended he instantly left the Lobby so the Host couldnt kick/ban him. Next Map starts he joins again. His Account was the Same Level as Mine and i have 400 hours on Steam.
And i remembered the Last Time i played there was a Player who was incredibly bad but also blatantly Cheating. He 100 % had WH and maybe a bad Aimbot aswell cant remember. He was so bad it wasnt really a Problem more of a Joke (small active Playerbase) and everyone knew him and that he Cheats. But he aswell was there for a long Time with a high level Account.

There is an In-Game Report System but who knows how these Work (number of Reports needed for an Investigation,no feedback ect.). In the past you had to provide a Screenshot and Video Footage of the Cheater and submit it via a support Ticket on the official Website. The Post with these Instructions on how to Report a Cheater still says the same and was last updated at the End of 2020.
Game seems to be kinda Dead aswell around 30 Customlobbys in Eu on a Saturday Evening. Tried to queue for a Ranked Match but couldnt find one. Seems like most active Players are from Asia .
There are better Options if u want a F2p-fps.
One thing i forgot is the 1-Tap in this Game is the most satisfying out of all the Games i ever played. The Sounds for Hits and Headshots are really nice."
19,good
20,nice
21,Game is dead. Don't even install. Also may be recording keystrokes. Not confirmed. Had fun in the past.
22,Bruh Squad
23,Great gameplay
24,"Played the game for 3 years and the game banned me for literally no reason.
The support would've been better if there was no support.
I recommend you to play other fps"
25,i like it
26,hmmmmmmmm
27,fps shooter
28,Nice FPS game
29,If I caught a disease everytime I was n a d e d I'd be dead af 10/10
30,It's fun to play once in a while
31,"I been playing this game, and i tell u there no sex here :|"
32,"when my dad saw the black squad, he rolled up his windows"
33,"probably the worst attempt at a knockoff fps game i've ever seen. the loader is weird, and everything is just thrown up on screen. awful graphics, and you'll never find a game. total waste of time."
34,"Very bad graphics, bad game mechanics. UI/UX is unbelieveable. Wouldnt bother to download it"
35,l
36,"It takes a special sort of game for me to not even be able to stomach it for an hour. The controls are clunky. It feels more like you are floating than moving on solid ground. The weapons all have 0 recoil and give zero satisfying sort of sound design. Everything sounds flat and cheesy. The music is annoying, Like, REALLY annoying. The menus are insanely confusing as well. It looks like they wanted to make a money factory sort of mobile game but got lost along the way and accidentally made a computer fps."
37,"ye
"
38,"I don't know why I downloaded. Mabey because it is free to play?

Yes That could be the point. Or because I am despried for a new good fps?
The problem with the game is, you get pre made weapon kits. All gear on them. So you have no choice how you weapon works. Than you move like in CS:GO but shoot like in CoD. So the worst part of both games.
If you have money you can buy new weapons ""versions"" but for what reason?
You could also buy some skins for your character why? - I don't know. It lokes like a game made for the chines marked and not for the western marked.
Try it but don't be sad with what sh*** you get."
39,Doo Doo
40,this game is so clunky sensitivity is either to fast or to slow and wont change until u change load outs its ridiculous i couldn't do it i will not be reinstalling this game its one of the worst shooters i've played in years play at ur own risk of getting aggravated at the clunky and awkward control's.
41,kos om al shotgun
42,"Absolutely without a doubt the worst FPS ive ever experienced in my life. Terrible UI control, movement feels sluggish and un-intuitive. I normally have more to say in my reviews but its all just bad."
43,good
44,its fun i would one hundred percent recomend its free i i feel like i shouldve bought it
45,"Player base is dead, but the game is fun."
46,"I remember being hyped for this game to come out, it was fun when I used to play it and it was even more fun with friends but what the f*ck has this game become I thought it is an fps shooter not softcore p*rn with guns and microtransactions"

50,"good

51,"Very good game. Somehow, not many US player playing. Better than Counter-Strike or Warface. Not pay to win, can buy permanent weapons easy, very fun."
52,i dont like it
53,so nice
54,good
55,"good game, hard to play sometimes with all the cheaters but that happens"
56,My account has been banned from blacksquad i have recovered my steam account after so much efforts after an year and now its banned when i played it after 1 year i have never ever cheated in my life in this game why is my account banned if i login it after an year i need help please i waited alot
57,"trash game waste of life, money and cum"
58,if you like call of duty black ops before the maps got small and COD become the overlord of p2w then you well like this game
59,Hacker fest. i watched a dude shoot a wall for 30 mins and rack up over 100 kills. 10/10 would not recommend
60,Game good. Not p2w. skins are fine but u get lots of shit for free.
61,recoil patterns are false and the game looks ps3 graphics
62,"the game is good and similar to most of fps, plus it has a lot of weapon and most of the weapon is good. 
"
63,good
64,"Not a bad game really. Haven't played it in a hot minute but it drew a lot of similarity to CS which I liked. Only thing is it didn't differ to much from it when I last played this, and needed some more uniqueness it probably now has gained in the past 2 and change years.

Reason I don't play this anymore is cause I'm generally not a big fan of FPS's, and never really have been."
65,"Ths game is a lootbox mess. You cant even get standard weapons without opening boxes. They want to implement that as normal to open boxes so you spend real life money on it. As balance of weapons goes, only usable guns are assault rifles as some of them can 1 shot you,but if you want to use shotgun or smg you will be very dissapointed. They clearly wanted to make this as assault rifle game,so they took away advantage of using smgs and shottys in CQC. Also you move with the same speed as smgs while holding an assault rifle. This game is a poor take on CSGO and a disgrace to FPS games. CSGO is made for gamers, Blacksquad is made to make you gamble with boxes and very bad gamplay after all. Save yourselff time and just download CSGO if you for some odd reason didnt to that already."
66,"If this game was a kebab, it would be a black kebab."
67,game sucks. shotguns are shit they have way to big of a spread
68,like it
69,"I'd like videos of game but... :(   BLACK SCREEEEEEN in common
I have played this game for 4 hour but all of this time was on black screen!!!
No way to fix, no support for fix and developer don't matter to this bug. from many years ago to now this problem is exist and there is no solution to fix it.
It's really bad supporting from developer.
I don't know whats the reason, but I try all solutions on the web, nothing worked. Now i must unistall this game :\
Good to any one that can play Black squad without black screen."
70,"j'ai bien assez joué pour affirmer que c'est l'un des PIIIIIIIIRE FPS auquel j'ai joué!
les armes sont a chier, quand tu met des heures a chercher une game avec de bon teammates, le jeu te change  d'équipe sans aucune raisons... 
ce jeu est immonde, la moitié des joueurs font n'importe quoi, aucune strat, aucun niveau (peut etre parce qu'il est gratuit?)
sans parler DES QUINZE MILLE MONNAIES VIRTUELS PAYANTES qu'ils ont mit dedans, 90% des recompenses (items) sont actives que pour 1j / 3j / 1 semaine.... donc faut racheter en boucle ces items bref les devs je vous ch*e dessus votre jeu est dégueulasse
BREF après tant d'heures de jeu et le peu de plaisir que j'en ai tiré, je desinstalle.

A FUIR !!"
71,"In the beginning this game was good due to good propaganda and graphics (2017) its was better than CSGO (In my opinion), but the game becomes down and down when the owners decided to move ESL and other tournaments away from the game, the game is absoluetly dead alot of cheaters of course yeah there`s a pro players i just mean the obivious cheater,even the steam market is closed.. My advice to the current owners to make a new step and remove the jackets from the game (it reducdes the damage of the rifle,sniper,etc.) this stupid..its not a BR game they need to balance the AR1 weapones (should be reduced), raise up the server tickrates again (it was 50, now its 25)
And unban the real pro players and make the tournaments back
Open the steam market again, buy a good anti cheats.. Or just focus on your game..."
72,g
73,"I wanted to like this game, but, queue times around 3 minutes minimum on weekend night.
- It had potential but don't bother unfortunately."
74,No kizzy this is the best game on steam no cap. My homies tooskuishy and ierre love it no cap they worked on making csgo and roblox phantom forces and they say this game is better
75,"ngl this game is super scuffy, i literally felt like i was playing a xbox 360 rip off cod black ops 2 game and it made me feel sad that this game is still up"
76,This game is absolute garbage. I rather play war thunder for 48 hours straight than 5 minutes of this game.
77,shit
78,Very bad!
79,"fun fast good graphics overall nice shooter
"
80,csgo mobile ripoff
81,"Its okay free to play shooter, played it for a bit before they switched publisher.
Its alot like the other f2p asian shooters with the difference is the grenade launcher.
otherwise it got the same as they normally do hot chick skins and lots of way to spend money.

Pros:
Gunplay is great
Not P2W
Good netcode
Some good content

Cons:
Cheaters (always in fps games anyway)
Not so happy about the new publisher
Grenade launchers (you get used to it)
Few new updates except for new skins and lootboxes

"
82,"Nice game ,  its fun"
83,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
84,It was fun back in 2019
85,9/10
86,It was fun back in the day.
87,perfect game
88,best game i ever played
89,My friend rage quitted everytime so i didnt get a chance to play ;(
90,Stupid nigger game.
91,game was great long time ago
92,this game is garbage
93,i dont lioke it
94,"Good game,Fun."
95,good
96,"fuck this game, banned me without even my hacking and this makes finding matches hard in csgo"
97,first of all you can see i spent quite some time in this game but i cant recommend it anymore honestly its so dead and instead of reviving what the developers should do they just make sure that theres more than enough microtransactions honestly you can have anything in this game aslong as you grab your fucking wallet. back in the day this game was in its early stages a lot of fun it was active it was cool it was yes awesome we didnt even have like 90% of the skins back then it was just a few to show off and flex on our friends now its kinda rare to not see a single person without some crazy expensive and rare knife its just a common thing and i cant even talk about gameplay changes because nothing changed the only thing that happens are hotfixes regarding the shop system..... what did you expect honestly
98,All good.
99,"VERY VERY BAD GAME,  VALOFE IS THE WORST COMPANY IN THE WORLD"
100,Peace of shit
101,good game for new players aaaaand its free
102,llll
103,"Shit game, was very good & had good advertisement when it came out & now it's just full of cheaters, IDK how you can manage to lose so many people after the start of the game, invested too much on hype, invested too little on anti-cheats."
104,Great game!
105,Its a great game! I really enjoy playing it!!!
106,"Seems to not work in Proton anymore.

Proton and Proton GE versions 7.x silently crash after clicking play in the launcher.

Proton 6.3-8 manages to launch the game, however Battleye kicks after about a minute in the main menu. Proton Battleye Runtime is installed."
107,ADD SEX!!
108,Black Squad?
109,Best fps game i ever seen
110,"Why did this game die , it was pretty good ."
111,"It is the best game up to now, but I hope the developers of Black Squad find way to block or reduce the hackers & cheaters and fix lag, noreg, high ping.
I hope you add old weapons and new weapons.
you can fill the room by bot players while the other players enter the room.
Good Luck."
112,...
113,gg
114,fun
115,no one in game :)))))))))))))
116," typical monke game, its decent but some how the dev is way too lazy to get id of the cheater"
117,Game itself is really fun  but saddly since events started to change instead to be the same every year quite lately a lot of ppl already left and from what i see cloing steam market for ingame cases and guns also pushed a lot of players away would be fun if there would be at least as many ppl as was last year playing it
118,When it works it is a good game

123,South.
124,this game is awful huge knock off of csgo i recommend just downloading csgo.
125,This is potentially the worst shooter I've ever played.
126,"Fun game with a moderate community! The game is fun when you can get into a game! The community is growing and active! Great game and easy to play, but hard to master! Lots of fun with friends!

130,"found someone using aimbot. tried reporting them and the game wouldnt let me. i ended up leaving in the middle of the match because i didnt want to be in the same lobby as a ""cheater"". ended up getting a temp suspension for leaving in the middle of a match. it was my first time leaving and already suspended? you honestly expect me to stay in a lobby with an aimbot user? ill pass. the fact this game is supporting ""cheaters"" like them and bans your for not wanting to play with ""cheaters"" is messed up. uninstalling the game. I do not recommend this game unless you have hacks/mods as this game apparently supports that stuff."

I would recommend to move on to black squad if you play classic combat arms. downside is trying to use money to get permanent weapons and skins and no nutshot announcer. 

I'd say the graphic is good. gameplay wise are medicore, microtransaction are craps"

175,Good game for low end PC/Laptop
176,"back in days when i play this game was pretty good, but now its not the same, everything has been changed. I enjoyed to play so much with snipers in this game, but know all of them are shit and the best part of the game WAS skins, but now even they are shit and when they remove it from marketplace, they just kill the game
"
177,"The game is good, but the game servers need to be strengthened"
178,rasisem >:(
179,can't beileve how dogshit this game was (compared to cs) jesus fucking christ
180,"its kind of similiar to a game called Wolfteam and its a great game overall,
current wolfteam is a p2w, i suggest you try but not for too much.

nice graphics, also low amount of space which is good for my patatoe pc,
great guns and physics."
181,its a good game
182,"Before I played Black Squad i had a small wee wee, no friends, no boyfriend and absolutely no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
183,"Theres basically nobody playing the game ever, and the game itself sucks anyway"
184,"You must have a VPN to play this game, and the movements of the people is very ironic"
185,Played this game for couple hours when i found out about it and honestly i really loved this game and enjoyed it the graphics are good the gameplay is decent and pretty much classic enjoyable game
186,good
187,"used to be good when it launched, now its just a garbage"
188,???
189,"Played it on 2017, came back for new experiences, its DEAD dont even try to go back to it. Try CS GO or Halo Infinite."

200,"It's can be good game just like back then

- Can Trade with other player using Steam Market
- You Can Get Permanent items by only using Gold
- Allow Player to choose server whenver they try create room
- You can get character Male or Female just with Single Click and Permanent
- More Cheater (yeah this one is worst than now actually)

one thing that need to adjust that i always ask back from 2019,
pls Buff Shotgun
and rework some maps, Demolation Map Site always have bad design, because have very minimum cover"
201,no
202,"good game, however literally in my first match the whole entire game shit itself and became unplayable, i couldn't move my mouse, walk, or even leave the match. it disabled my access to the windows key and i had to shut down my PC manually in order to get the fucking game to close because guess what... alt F4 doesn't close the game either when this happens. very very very annoying bug.

edit: haven't played the game since i posted this review... 14 hours on record... apparently i'm perma banned"
203,Boring.
204,the best game ever made
205,Lame

228,so so so dead game
229,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

233,i don't even remember ever playing this
234,i don't even remember ever playing this
235,"Map design is terrible and there is a lot of nadespam, otherwise a decent game."
236,kinda bullshit that market is down for a long time and theres still no black man 2 i mean black squad 2
237,good gsme I am nostalgia
238,
239,graphics are nice
240,2.5/5
241,"NO TOXIC, HIGH QUALITY, FUN"
242,play and enjoy it....u never dissapointed
243,"In my opinion is this game very good but there are some things that I don't like:
- The Matchmaking is pretty bad
- Some weapons are really expensive

The good thing is that you don't really have to spend money in order to be good at the game. In the end you just have to be good, of course you need a good weapon too, but you can get good weapons really early in the game"
244,game is dead becuase steam market is close by the devs
245,not bad but also not that good

247,i swereed this gam was posed to be god but it bad an i dont like cuz it didnt shooty as good as csgo
248,free and no player ?
249,"all was good , until the developer changed."
250,my progress is lost !?
251,OK
252,"For Real? the worst F2P shooter ever.

1. Matchmaking is an absolut nightmare, imagin being rank 4 and u get enemys with ranks 200. its exacly like this in this game just dumb.

2. people really dont know how to play any mode: Search and destroy every round the bomb carrier just runs around and search the enemy, instead of planting the bomb, when u have the bomb u are ALWAYS alone.

3. the weapon handling is just more then just crap, i´d rather play F2P csgo and get hacked away xD

THINK before u install this ""Game"""
253,Literally the worst multiplayer FPS I have ever played in my life lmaooo
254,"Idk what they want to achieve with their game Black Squad is a Bullshit Game now, They have banned iconic youtubers and famous Streamers claiming them cheating, Even though many people provide them proof of their innocence They went on banning streak for some weird reason thatswhy no one is playing this game their players has been decreased tremendously past few years even ns-Studio left their sponsor with this stupid game i would not recommend any one to play this game, I Don't support this game anymore."
255,"SHIT GAME, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME PLAYING. SHITTY SHITTY SHIT FUCK GAME."
256,i love this game
257,me and other 3 players are in this game. very good!
258,Very nice game and it's free to play WOW
259,WOW
260,"The downside of this game is kicking players for high ping, this is absolutely annoying.
Also, the ante-cheat system is continuously kicking players for no reason."
261,"nice
"
262,"csgo still better, screw this game for pay to win lmfao what a joke."
263,Got banned for skill after 14 hours...... Trash game and 0 response hindu support.
264,"pretty fun game, bad optimisation"
265,its good fps game
266,"It might be one of the worst FPS games out there.It's just a bad run and gun game,with really bad hitboxes,weapons look like they're made of paper,there is just nothing nice in this game.Some might like it,but there are way better options out there (Ironsight,Warface) so you should definitely check those out.This game tho....big NO NO."
267,"ffffafaf

268,Goated
269,"The game is dead like i cant find anyone not like the ol' days when the game is still popular, anyways great game actually can run in low end pc's heck even on my old intel celeron n4100, great fps game"

"
277,everything you buy using gold is temporary meaning that if you want to continue with a weapon after you lost it due to the dumb temporary weapon system you gotta get a bunch of gold so you can keep buying it
278,"I really really like this game. The weapons are good including the skins and everything and the gameplay is really engaging. However, the game is ruined when hackers come along. Ive seen some hackers recently and i have been losing alot of games because of this, ive reported them and i don't they are getting banned."
279,yes
280,"Low quality copy of CS,
fun to play."
281,cs go better
282,"In-game icons, images and menus induce epilepsy how flashy and crowded they are. The pay-to-win mechanism on weapons and merchandise is also strong on this one as well as the fact that you get many weapons and equipment on a per-day basis, but you have to pay to get them permanently. The game itself is good, the game is fun and the overall feel is okay."

286,Game is really boring
287,Game yang mantap
288,"I played this game back in 2020, at the moment she is already dead lol....Once I could get into it, but now I can only look at how the game is looking for a skating rink for me..It's not that I'm sad, because she was more like a temporary hobby for me, nothing more"
289,"but why is it black squad why no white squad
this game is very a racist and should be deleted or renamed to people squad
BLM-Blowjob Ligma"
290,OK GAME
291,good game
292,FUCKING THIS GAME
293,ITS MUY BIEN
294,"Yeah, you can not be a pro with any weapon because the actual devs changes the weapon's recoil and damage  everytime. Also, of course there are cheaters too but also devs does not care too much."
295,fire asf
296,sus
297,"Too laggy to be playable. I kill someone and I see them die, then suddenly I am dead and I never landed a shot. I still have almost 500hrs in this game because I really enjoyed it and made some really good friends because it has a great community, but there are still many problems that should have been fixed long time ago. I see a great potential for this game. but unfortunately it seems like the developers are more focused on making money through skins and mystery boxes."
298,GL
299,good game
300,.
301,"Old school FPS, so far having a great time."
302,.
303,"Freezing all the time, bad game"
304,MAKE BACK ALIVBE
305,pretty good
306,good game
307,bob
308,good shit
309,10/10
310,giatay asdcbvc
311,I recommend this game to everyone. It`s very entertaining and easy to play.
312,boringgg
313,not bad
314,why not try it lol
315,it good
316,No
317,good fps game
318,i want BS steam market back! please
319,"I haved been banned cause cheat detected, but I'm not using some program Illegal, then I just log in again for a long time, and I got banned immedietly"
320,Counter-Strike but it's Call of Duty and it's loaded with micro-transactions
321,decent
322,"Awesome

~Quandale Pringle"
323,POV: you're too poor to even own CS:GO
324,Enjoy game crash every second match or randomly frezzing for your and your friends.
325,Kir To Namose In Game
326,niceee
327,easdas
328,"pros: runs very nice and looks good 
cons: some items are limited pretty annoying"
329,Good Game :)
330,gud
331,Its alr
332,10/10 would recommend spent half an hour getting murdered
333,"Keeps you busy, hours of fun - Serve your own up to 5 players or join on one already in action.  Large hosted servers are available which can host a more players.  Large selection of weapons."
334,"really fun
"
335,"Black Squad, to say the least, is a harrowing feat of engineering. I can not remember one moment of my time playing this game, but that does not mean that I dislike(d) it. This game deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for all the wrong reasons."
336,it good
337,"fun game, wished they had  SnD tho"
338,The game is good but there are no boobs sadly
339,just dont this is the most pay to win game ever made
340,"Re-visited this ""game"" and found out that it became the biggest cash grab of all time with trillions of microtransactions and RNG boxes, barely has content where you can buy straight from the shop, the game has like 4 currencies where you can't do much besides the one you have to put money on. No wonder why the game's dead, this is the definition of what other games shouldn't have too much of, and the overwhelming amount of  weapon RNG boxes, the crappy season pass and it's free rewards ""which are only based on grenades, small amounts of in-game currency and EXP boosts"" pretty much sums it up why the game has less than 1000 players and decreasing. Back in the BETA days this game was glorious but unfortunately it took a humungus L cause of the greediness of the developers, sadge to see a game with such potential and visuals get destroyed like this..."
341,"good game some things id like to be add-ed the move ment and leaning would be good but really good game o hop every one else thinks the same
"
342,Good
343,its fun for a free shooter with a low storage cost
344,"the game is aight and all but, gotta do rework for the case opening
you spend shit ton of coins on it, and still get none G, all am saying cuz is game aight, but a little letdown fool i say.

"
345,Fast paced and you get enough freebies to keep it interesting.
346,"I'd love to tell you something about the game, if i could fucking play it, but the 3 times i tried, i was changing settings and it crashed, i played againsts bots and it crashed during the middle of the second encounter i had with a bot and then on the third attempt, i queued for TDM 8 vs 8 and after like 3 minutes of nothing, the game crashed again, it's a goddamn sign. What even is this game anyways, it has like 10 maps but it's been out for years and it has 8 modes that all suck, no Domination, Hardpoint, Kill Confirmed, just TDM, Gunfight i think, Search and Destroy and some modes they made up, one of which sounds like a shitty Capture the Flag and the other was similar to Gun Game, i can't even remember the rest because they all sounded so boring or confusing, and the game seems Pay 2 Win as well, but that begs the question... who in their right mind is paying to win in a game where you can't even join a match to win with what you just paid for in the first place? Don't even bother downloading, it doesn't work, it's P2W and it's lacking content with apparently a ghost town of a Playerbase and i'm pretty sure i saw a tumbleweed. Ironsight isn't a great game by any means, but definitely a better alternative than... whatever this garbage is supposed to be."

356,"Nice game, but too many cheaters cheaters."
357,NO SERVERS!!!! YOU MIGHT GET ONE OR TWO GAMES GOING ON DIFFERENT DAYS BUT NOT TWO GAMES IN ONE DAY. THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME. ITS HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE UI WORKS IN THE LOBBY AND THERE'S NO WAY TO FILTER OUT UNWANTED INFO. THE GAME NEEDS MORE PLAYERS. AND THEY HAVE THE NERVE TO HAVE MICRO TRANSACTIONS LOLOLOLOLOLOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
358,Epic.

360,nope
361,old but gold
362,very good game do not recomend
363,"Its not that fun, its a knock off of csgo. Dont waste your time like i did."
364,"This game is a prime example of everything that is wrong with the current gaming culture / industry. Mediocre CS-a-like gameplay + crappy tech + F2P + a full load of microtransactions.

Pure garbage."
365,fun
366,"This game used to be great. I lost my steam account in 2019 and took a large break from PC gaming, and came back to a game that was a complete money grab an has spiralled into a cesspit of broken mechanics, scuffed game-modes and developers who lack the ability to care about the very thing they are working on."
367,"After [i] carefully analyzing [/i] this game for [b] 13 minutes [/b], I have concluded that it is utter dog sh!t."
368,absolute crap. that's why i am giving it a positive review

379,they still cant fixed the maintenance forever issue
380,This game is not worth reinstalling anymore. I remember playing this as an alternative of CSGO now its both CSGO and Call of Shitty (COD). This game is not fun anymore. Don't Reinstall this game if you have but if your new just  install CSGO or Call of Shitty (COD). Don't play this game. I remember where you can buy weapons with Gold for permanent and not exchanging it for medals. This game is free to play and I'm not going to play this game again.

398,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

439,"[h1]In its current state, I don't recommend this game.[/h1]
This game used to be great. I lost my steam account in 2019 and took a large break from PC gaming, and came back to a game that was a [b]complete money grab[/b] and has spiralled into a cesspit of broken mechanics, scuffed game-modes and developers who [b]lack the ability to care[/b] about the very thing they are working on. 

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Positives[/h1]
The game still has its same feel generally gameplay wise. The kills you get are still satisfying, the sounds are wonderful and I believe the teams are usually quite well balanced. I also believe the servers are fairly decent, when playing from users from the same region at least. 
The guns themselves are generally good, the ability to [b]suppress weapons[/b] makes it fun and allows for you to take a couple of different strategies when fighting, allowing for more stability at the cost of slight damage reduction.
Competitive mode is also great, giving you the ability to unlock cool weapons as you continue moving through the ranks and obtaining winner tokens, and is very good at choosing similar skill levels to your own.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
[b]The game is nothing more than a bad attempt at a cash-grab.[/b] The developers seem to only care about money, with packages for heavy amounts of bullets [i](the in-game currency)[/i] that give insane amounts of items and skins and leaves the users with no money to catch scraps, which is heavily unfair, along with making the drop rates of permanent skins almost nothing in the paid boxes, makes it practically impossible to keep a steady loadout in-game. When they initially had a whole section of the Steam Market, I believe it was more balanced, as users were able to trade skins and not lose money - an example being receiving duplicate guns and having the ability to trade them with another user for a gun you'd like. I have 4 weapons permanent that are the exact same skin and weapon, that give me a whopping 200 BS coins - also known as [b]'pittance'[/b]. With the current amount of skins on the game, it would make them more money than with the micro-transactions alone. The fact that you need to spend ridiculous amounts to do something as simple as changing your name are beyond me.
The netcode needs changing. A full game of EU players being placed in US/OCE servers is ridiculous, and if someone is above 100 ping it is practically unplayable.
[b]The staff do not care about cheaters.[/b] I placed a report with video evidence regarding a cheater with aimbot and [b]extended reach when knifing[/b]. [b]EXTENDED REACH.[/b] This isn't Minecraft. I was banned for two days for 'Unfair Activity' and had no opportunity to get a valid response from either creating a ticket or talking to the staff on Discord and Steam.
The new map, 'Open Storage', is a god awful attempt at map-making when put in a 5v5 pool, with the sheer scale. Games always run out of time, never actually down to score. Terrible.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
This game needs a lot of work. I want this game to improve so badly and I really believe the devs and the staff are capable of doing so. 
But we're yet to see the false ban message to be fixed 10 months after its inception in-game when a user's internet dies.
Will I keep playing? Yes.
Will I put anything into this game? [b]No.[/b]

[b]Do better, VALOFE.[/b] You bought this game from its original developers, continue their work rather than making a pathetic attempt at making a few bucks on an IP.
[b]This game was great before your logo was smeared all over the loading screen.[/b]

[hr][/hr]

When other players join a match, they are put on your team so the game is against bots the whole time. The bots with sniper rifles camp and are hard to kill without a sniper rifle."

472,"As a player since release on steam. The game died because of the devs. Recommended before but not anymore

Reason why the game died:
-blacksquad steam market removed
-so many skins
-you dont know how valuable the skin is because the market has removed.
-you cant buy skin anymore in the steam market
-its now easy to win prizes that was harder before
-not optimized in performance, even on a 
 decent pc
-its hard to navigate on the menu compared before
-they added so many currency ingame
-you cant talk/chat to your enemies anymore
-voice chat is only available on 
 competitive match
-the devs only care about money
-high server latency ingame
-you cant invite friends who are on 
 inventory or menu anymore
-you cant play it anymore on older 
 computers at playable state
-so many rewards that was harder to get before, but now they are rewarding you some trash to keep playing
-you can now buy some trash christmas light gun

480,"Y I K E S 

This game REALLY sucks. (TL:DR at bottom)

Menu design is EXTREMELY store focused, very clearly a pay2win game. Even if you ignore that, The game has pretty terrible performance for such low fidelity graphics, Stuttered on my RTX build. Shooting feels clunky and bad. The Recoil sucks, and It does not help that the hitreg and hitboxes seem to also have a lot of problems. Also does not help that you have Slender 8 Pages walking speed. A lot of the Non-Special weapons have missing textures or aspects of the model that glitch out. The 3 maps I played were all very poorly designed and don't end up making logical sense. Game is also fairly dead in America, Typically ~4-8 people on at peak times.

 I actually instantly came across a hacker when I finally got into my first game. A kind gentleman in chat actually let me know that some of the Devs cheat in their own game, and that there's been a massive hacking problem since release that has been totally ignored.

For a budget like the one they apparently had, I'm surprised at how many FPS essentials were totally missed. I feel like a game with this formula (minus the pay2win stuff) could work really well, But this one just does not.

TL:DR;
-Main menu design sucks
-Pay2win
-Bad performance
-Terrible shooting with slow walking
-Broken weapon models
-Poorly designed maps
-Game dead
-Devs cheat in it, ignored hacking problem"

487,"Hot freemium garbage. Couldn't even find the start match button through the first 8 minutes of the game being launched because it just bombards you with ""BUY THIS LOOT CRATE SKIN GUN COIN!"" immediately upon launch. Then I got into the game and I was met with all of the nonsense ""feel good"" mechanisms. From loud headshot notifs and player callouts. It's really, really, really bad overall. Don't waste your time.

Unfortunate lack of good multiplayer FPS available that aren't a bunch of Battle Royale trash. Desperation led me here, but it wasn't strong enough to keep me lmao"
488,"Not recommend for you playing fps game, cuz this ""anti hack"" system so dumb too many hacker and just this developer always ""Care"" about money they're too broke hired cyber security, better play another fps game"
489,underrated game
490,good stuff here
491,"used to be my favourite game
Took a break from it in 2019. 
I came back to a cash grab and ruined game. 
Here is a list:
- They removed the steam marketplace (so you have to buy skins through their game)
- Every single update is just adding more skins (because they only care about taking your money)
- The game is plagued by hackers.
- Its horribly optimised.
Basically if you want to have a shit time, play this game"
492,"I would say this game used to be really good...But after break I took from this game, which was insanely long...I went into the LIDL store lol... I mean movement, aiming and even graphic is terrible and kinda unoptimized. Because having not even 70 fps on RTX 3070 (even it is laptop gpu), is kinda stupid. I also found out about shutting down a Steam marketplace which caused even more player lose. I loved this game, when it used to be good, but now it is LIDL unoptimized simulator of unfinished fps game. If I would compare it to many other fps games...I would say it is one of the worst, maybe the worst fps game on Steam that used to be good...Farewell but this is just not right. There is too many problem in this game as mentioned before, with some even still not fixed ones like lack of menu design and features. Which are for example being able to browse during waiting match time or better inventory access and item collecting or even too complicated menu design. Shame is, that this game pontencial was insane and it all went to ash."
493,"Its.. idk its kinda copy from csgo, graphics are good but you cant compare its gameplay to cs."
494,Trash game
495,satisfying game which has a good gameplay and chest opening in between games.
496,One of the best shooting games... Lots of maps and modes. Easy to learn and does not need much patience straight in and start playing without wasting time.

520,"this game is amazing
"
521,its low pop but fun to mess around on. surprised its not a bigger game but so what if its fun u should play it regardless of player base.
522,"This game feels like a more modern take on CSGO with its gunplay, artstyle/graphics, and overall the way it handles itself.  Unfortunately, the ""free to play"" aspect in this one shines HEAVY because alot of important stuff like weapons and classes are hidden behind a pay wall or an extreme amount of grinding time for something so simple.  Had potential, execution was a little off."
523,"Fun game, simple free to play shooter. Love to get online every few months to fire a few shots."
524,"I've been laying black squad ever since 2018, since early access. It's a great game with smooth gameplay, but it indeed has flaws, notable ones. Map design is a drawback, sabotage and paper company are some of the few good maps, but the others make it impossible to push a certain bomb site. Old temple is one of them, B site is almost impossible to take over unless good co-ordination with those rushing through mid. Valofe is also the one maintaining this game now, and Valofe's notorious for killing games, but black squad somehow keeps surviving. Graphics are good even on potato mode, and this game is as light as an fps game could be. One of this game's major benefit is that it isn't pay to win, far from that."

528,"nice

529,"Used to play this with a couple of friends during the pandemic in 2021 and It was fun. I re-installed it today to see what has been done and... the game sucks from the core mechanics standpoint. If u use a sniper rifle and u try to jump and shoot the bullet goes anywhere but where u were aiming. Time to kill is sometimes quick and sometimes long. Would I reccomand this game in 2022? Maybe with friends to have a laugh and some fun time, but If u want to play this game in solo...HELL NO! They've even disabled global chat so u can't say to the camping bastards that they should uninstall the game."
530,I don't want to be stan
531,Kinda like a CSGO but better in my opinion great game!!
532,pubg mobile for pc
533,it suck can not play

535,almost crashed my computer when i closed the game
536,"It is one of the best and most exciting shooter games, but some players spoil enjoying for other players by cheating the game, but thanks to battle aye, they are soon banned. This game gives you many skins, a few of which are permanent"
537,Very good game. It has something different about it compare to other shooters. its very addictive.
538,old but gold
539,"I prefer this over CS:GO, fun to play with friends."

542,Fun game but cheats are common
543,"Score: 6.5/10 

There are better free to play FPS games out there currently but the skins are really good, cosmetics are great, guns are balanced. Map design is pretty good but the game is dead. The pro scene is no longer active in this game either."

553,"Can no longer play. Game keeps crashing after 3 minutes. Reinstalled many times, checked integrity every time.
Even reinstalled windows didn't fix it. 
Submitting tickets no longer easy as before after the new management took over.
Support basically non-existent. Spent waaay too much time trying to fix the game, instead of playing it.
It used to be quick and easy fun, as reflected in 888 hrs play time. 
Unfortunately all good things must come to an end."
554,"This is one of those games where one match is all you need to know if you like it, and in my opinion, this game fucking sucks. If you're expecting CoD, Battlefield, or even Homefront, this ain't it. Clunky controls comparable to ancient F2P FPS like Wolf Team or Combat Arms, impressive graphics for a DX9 game but still dated as hell for a 2019 release on Steam, and a bad feel to the gunplay. Your starting weapon, for example, has almost entirely horizontal recoil and sways under fire like stoned Rambo. Pistols are useless, CSGO knife mechanics, and grenade launchers that make spit wads look lethal. 

If you're looking for a good F2P shooter, go play Halo Infinite. Despite its issues, it's a much better game than this"

681,"very great game but it has a pay to win system

682,pp go brrr
683,Great Game. Very well done
684,"Maintenance and updates for a while now, Hopefully this maintenance unblocks the game from regions where it should be working fine. otherwise this will remain a thumbs down because i spent money on a game that's now blocking my region... what a dirty scam it'll be if these devs are shameless enough to block a region where active players buy skins from the in-game shop with actual money."
685,"was a time fill knock-off of CS. same thing many games have copied, hidden behind a massive paywall of useless crap. honestly was only good as a time filler as i said. HOWEVER, i think it's BS i was banned. i have never hacked on this game, i mean, there wouldn't even be a reason to. it's free. but whatever. download this crappy game if you want a free VAC ban on record!"
686,who the fuck even plays this anymore
687,"First, conclusion： I don't recommend any new players to play this game now，it used to be good， but since Valofe took over it ，its poorly managed.
1.Paying money only get you skins, they are not different from the original guns. But now you cant buy permanent guns in the shop（with in game currency Gold), but basicly if you want to get guns，you probably still need to pay real money. 
2.We used to be able to buy guns（without skins，original ones）through a kind of in game currency called Medal in Exchange shop，Since last update， they cancled most of the guns that you can buy through medals，so basicly，you still need to pay to get guns. So , in conclusion, you can get nothing free from it now.
3.Anticheat system is nonsense, you can see someone get kicked by battleye system and next round you see him in another room, that literally happens in every match，every game and every server. Every match somebody gets kicked.
4.Server problem, i can see many people post in the forum says that they get sent to a server with more than 200 ping and get kicked by the system because of high ping, Basicly they cant start a normal match.Sadly you cant change your server, its fixed unless you use VPN, but that leads to another problem, you get banned by using VPN, too. lol, BS.
5.Closing Steam market, BlackSquad used to have its own steam market, players can trade their skins, but Valofe thinks that hurts their wallet so they closed it, BlackSquad used to have more than 10000 playes, now? 1000, 1/10, money , money, money.
6.Boxes, you can only get skins through opening boxes in game by paying real money, there are also problems here, 1st, chances of getting permanent skins are incredible low,  2nd, if you get a permanent skin, you probably don't like it ， because it is ramdom, so even if you got a permanent gun skin, you may dont use it, because that gun sucks or you dont like that gun, like i said, you randomly get a permanent skin.
7.when i say that Blacksquad used to be good, it was before Valofe took over it, it was great. Has all the potential to be a great game. Neowiz is good and generous to all players，we got good skins and new game modes and maps during that time, it was really fun and good, now ? its trash.
8. Banning players for no reason. I used to see posts about that in the forum but i never took it seriously, but just yesterday，many decent players that I know got banned， without specific reason, lol, when i say many, i say at least 8 players that i know, in one day, this is nonsense. since there are so many cheaters out there.
9. Also if you joined a clan, and there are 1 or 2 players cheating in that clan, then all the clan members get banned, what is that ， feudal society？ lmao.
10 Since Valofe took over， they only announce new prostitute—looking skins ， no new modes（Capture the Flag mode： why the fk i crash every single time ， lol）， only one ridiculous new map， bugs everywhere， ridiculous bugs like ， the daily mission  requires you finish 6 competitive matches, and you played 7 competitive matches, the mission still not finished and still says 0/6, lol, cant you even do that right? Like the capture the flag mode, every time the game crashes, lol, and bugs are everywhere.
11. Maintenance， Blacksquad used to have maintenance every 2 weeks，6 hours maintenance and you find they have nothing new， and every time they extended the maintenance at least 2 more hours， every time they extended it. literally every single time EXTENDED，cant you do the math and calculate the time?
12. The developers never took advice from the players seriously ， actually they never take it at all， you just post in the forum and then get banned in the forum， lol . feudal society？ lmao.
13. Dont waste your time, since Valofe take players as shit, why bother to waste your time?"
688,"its good but forcing players into unsuitable servers isnt ok, especially when you then get kicked for high ping and lose exp etc"
689,"Lots of hack/cheat, mostly Korean (game creator country) reported for months and still there. Anti-cheat system also trash, you see someone get banned for cheating but 10s later he re-join the room. Ping is fake, 120ms but i feel like 300-500ms, have you ever seen the animation of hand throwing grenade is finish but 1s later the nade start flying?"

708,"The game is good! I liked it, but when two men with big trunks approached me from behind, I was a little scared. I saw two young men running with a bomb and these two with guns wanted to kill them, so I decided to let them kill good people. I stabbed two men with trunks and let people with a bomb clear the hangar of debris. They thanked me and drew a picture with a heart. I was very happy, but they called me names on the radio. I still didn't understand why I was insulted (But I liked playing)"
709,"Jogo bom pra passar o tempo se seu pc não roda jogo pesado, fps zoadão mas divertido"

740,"Truly on the drip feed, doing the most minimal of new additions to not look as abbandoned as a it truly is.

Sad story, considering at its height it was one of the best, if not outright *the* best F2P FPS."
741,y
742,great game
743,"It's legit your typical asian, F2P shooter that is conveniently similar to CSGO. There isn't much to say about it.
Timed, hard to (permanently) attain weapons, alright looking skins with 0 appeal to buy, and very, very unbalanced player base with sweats and kids in between. Ocasional hacker, but not too often from what I've played, quite surprising considering the very dodgy anti-cheat it uses. Oddly enough, the P2W in the game is not excessive like in other games of the same genre. 

Overall, an OK experience. If you have a shitty computer this should run. If you don't, you probably have better games to play."

Reasons:
-The Game is now owned by a [b] Very GREEDY Corp.[/b] 
-Disabling the Market Place
-Devs stopped Listening to the Playerbase anymore
-Ban Ban Ban, For everyone, 
`Fake Reports? BAN
`Too skilled? BAN
`Unsatisfied w/ the Game ? BAN

-Competitive Mode has now become d** s***
-Shitty Events
-Dog s*** Game Modes


I don't hate the game, I simply hate on what it now have become."
769,"a nice alternative to traditional FPS, REALLY LOUD on first launch
"
770,"The game had potential to be a CSGO replacement, but they ruined it. I don't even have it installed anymore. There's a reason the player count continues to dwindle, and it will continue to do so until there's nothing left but a few cheaters aimbotting each other on the asian servers."
771,the game is about u listening to the 80 years old man dying in rage and saying ur shit without saying ur shit

780,Simple and good maps
781,when i tried to load into a match the game froze and also the game randomly crashed when I tried to find a match of arms race so play this game if you have a stroke
782,Fun asf. I like that its simple shooting game with no abilities that complicate it and i see it doesnt have a toxic community.
783,Dont remember playing this. Good Game
784,yews
785,"After this new company took of the game from its original devs,
Black Squad became worse than ever, and as an old player I really miss those days where the game wasn't P2W like now.
Literally every permanent weapons became hard to get, I dont really have a problem with that since i already have almost every gun in the game for a permanent period (on my main account) , but the new users ? oh I forgot VALOFE doesn't give a SH!T about the players, their goals is ""money"", nothing more, nothing less, that's why it looks like ,in every new update, instead of fixing bugs and improving the game to a better status they only add skins, more and more skins, and at least no one is expecting more from these D**khead Devs.
VALOFE YOU REALLY FKED UP THE GAME, shame on you!"
786,Ew no
787,"For free just play any other fps game, the maps are badly designed with one of the sides having more advantage, its super hard to get decent weapons, overall its a bad game with a very little playerbase, i literaly played with the same people for 6 matches straight theres no players in it. Do not recomend at all."

868,Empty now. No one plays it. :(
869,"Overall pretty bad game....

Upon joining a match, I really liked the weapon models, and the positioning of the hands on the guns, a detail that I really liked. However, my first problem came into play the second I scoped in. The scope in speed was instantaneous, removing the sense of realism made by the graphics and weapon models. 

This game is also very similar to CS:GO, with little change to anything. Note the developing studio name of CS:GO being Valve, and the dev studio of this game being ""Valofe"". 

From the outside, the game is appealing, but in reality its built like a 2016 mobile game with slightly better graphics. I played for only 10 minutes and it was not fun. If things get improved, I and I'm sure many other people will come back to it."
870,"Its been a long time since I played BS. It was pretty good, an alternative filling a hole in free fps games, at least back then. I especially liked the daily Credits rewards, the best thing was weapons are permanent. No shatty durations that make pressure to play and play and play. I didnt seem to find any pay2win aspects. I guess its cool to have some skins or two but in the end its all cosmetic. Keep in mind this was a long time ago. It was truly fun back then and not even buggy. Never got a bug once. Very awesome memories slaying the Box thing with my Juggernaut Chainsaw. 
Looking on update changelogs and news section shows me that they ve come a long way. The game is much much better then it already was for sure now. If now pls feel free to comment. Have a nice day or night wherever you maybe, Thx for reading ^^"

889,"10/10 - Honest Review From a Long Term Player (~ 800 Hours Played)

Summary:
- Hardworking development team that listens to the community.
- Good graphics and attention to detail.
- Servers are powered by Amazon Web Service, so it is very reliable. If there is an issue, it usually gets resolved quickly.
- Discord / Chat / Community offers a friendly community.
- Cheaters are always dealt with. Those cheating do not receive event rewards.
- There is always a community event each week where players can interact with the staff.
- Support Center is always helpful helping me to resolve an issue. Support tickets are usually answered really fast!

A huge thank you to the game! I really enjoy it."
890,need free gun :v
891,F U N
892,Game freezes when loading
893,"Terrible UI, didn't tell me the controls, took me 5 minutes to figure out how to close the game, (without force closing through steam). A copy of CS:GO, with better a addition, such as ADS on every gun (only 1 I noticed), but this games goods are not as noticeable as its bads, as I said ""Terrible UI, didn't tell me the controls, took me 5 minutes to figure out how to close the game, (without force closing through steam)"" at the beginning of this review, no bhopping, weird key mapping (F is for suppressor?!) and basically no other keys do important things, such as the buy menu, or a weapon change menu. The audio isn't pleasing, in a far superior game called rust, the guns have impact, and are loud af. In this game, the guns sound like the developers recorded the sound made by Top Cap Guns, (which are the toy revolvers, that pop). To exit the game itself, you have to leave the game you are in by pressing escape, once on the main menu, there is no ""Exit"" or ""Quit"" button, you have to press escape again, and then you can quit. This is not explained afaik.

895,"Since after competitive Season 9 or 10, the developers have  fucked up few guns like type 95 and ak12. And now when u try to do 1 taps or spray the enemy down your crosshair just jumps around. Plus also the flak jacket update the most usless on ever in my opinion. But if u want to play Black Squad then play it. Im not the judge."

I like the way our character runs with knife, that view of  movement is too good. Even though some things need to be balanced in this game but still It's a pretty good game. I would highly recommend this game."

952,nonsense
953,One of the best FPS games on steam
954,wow u destroy this game man
955,good game
956,n1 game
957,nice game
958,GOOD GAME BUT THERE ARE TOO MANY NOOBS / LOUSERS PLAYING IN SOMETIMES...
959,toooooooooooooooooo much maintenance as hole fack
960,first online game of my life
961,It was nice.
962,bad game. The servers have so much lag that you get show from behind walls and people shoot you before you even have time to react. Feels like a poor mans call of duty mixed with CSGO and PUBG somehow.
963,"[b] Not For good FPS players [/b]

Up to this point, I had often seen topics about ""ban for no reason"". I read these pathetic attempts to excuse myself quietly chuckling in my mind thinking ""Ha! Another hacker trying to justify himself, but he won't succeed"".

The other day playing, the system threw ""skilled eagle players"" against me. In the middle of the game I got a ton of ""you are recorded, wait a ban, hacker"" messages from a player who thinks he is the best player ever. I laughed silently in my head.

What was my surprise that I actually got a ban after maintenance. Any attempts I made at tech support were pointless with tons of proof. (Other installed games with the same ClientSide AC, etc), Nevermind. I was really disappointed in the developer of this game. It immediately changed the way I feel about all the blocked players. They really could have been blocked for nothing.

[b]Just don't waste your time here. Especially if you are a good player.[/b]
[b]You can indeed be blocked by the developer without giving a reason[/b]"
964,"good game
"
965,"Very fun game, its kind of like csgo but with better movement."
966,wow ez pp
967,"There is no ""Pay for Win"". Thankfully"
968,it was all fun and games until they took out the steam market
969,"The game itself is pretty good. It is similar to CS:GO so if you have already played that you may enjoy this.

Recently the developers have been trying to milk the community of any money and have made everything based on loot-boxes in the shop. Getting a permanent weapon would be a struggle for a new user. New content in the way of guns and maps are sparse.

There are many fun gamemodes to play however most of them occur as a random daily events and don't get many players playing so matchmaking for them can be a pain.

Hackers are not too common overall, however if you encounter one chances are it won't ever be banned.

In all likelihood, after the developers milk any remaining money from the community they will shut it down. Therefore I cannot recommend playing this game unless you have already invested a lot of time and money into it."
970,It's just fun and feels very different from other fps shooters.
971,if you like csgo play this its really fun and FREEEEEEEE
972,Yes is a nice game but can be better.>!<
973,GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
974,.

976,"I somehow got a skin of an anime girl, now i stand out in competitive games and am topfragging"

978,"good game!
"
979,its good
980,"NS Studio made a flawed, but overall fair and enjoyable game.
Valofe ruined it. They are doing everything they can to milk the remaining community dry, while not only ignoring technical issues with the game, but also introducing new ones.
Stay away from this game if you value your time and sanity."

982,"Good game and in overall i enjoyed it alot.
first of all the matchmaking takes to much time.
secondly, the community is very toxic.
thirdly, the competative matchmaking makes no sense, why im as a wolf need to fight vs a dragon or a lion? .
in general i would not recommend the game because of those 3 reasons.
also there arent enough players in this game."

better on it's own"
998,Worst matchmaking on the planet

1000,"I love the name of this game, BLACK squad. me and my friends never play this game bcs it kinda dead now but to be honest it was fun about 3 years ago"
1001,Basically csgo with mods...pretty cool
1002,Not very good
1003,yah
1004,Great
1005,super fun
1006,"  don't recommend playing this game. Devs don't care about cheaters.
Don't even try to play competitive,there are like 30+ wallhackers and minimum 10 aimbots.
If you're trying to report a player,devs need like 2 months,to check the player and ban him. But it's only if he's aimbot.
Wallhackers never get banned in black squad.
Noregs- there are always no-registered shots,and they won't fix this. If your ping is 100+ You will get like 10 + noregs every game.
Updates - always the same updates,skins,skins,sometimes new guns,new map.. New maps and weapons always bad.
NA servers are dead. There is only Left EU AND ASIA. if you're NA player,you gonna play in EU server with 120+ ping.
About competitive - there are always the same rewards,same calling cards. If you're top100 you will get different knife,but same calling cards with same text,everything same..
I reported like 5 cheaters,but no one got banned,because they answer me "" We will investigate the player further"" After 3 months,player still not banned and using clearly wallhack.
It was the trading system , everyone traded the skins,it was amazing! But they removed the trading system.
Good luck everyone! have a great day!"
1007,"good game, lets make this game hype again"
1008,i like this game because have high grafik and no hacker players inside game
1009,the game is good the problems why i will not recommend is because there is no market ! you cant chose the type of gun you want to open on box so you get randomly shit weapons if you want to win good weapon you need to spand 300$ if you are free to play guy/girl go warzone or cs go warzone becouse you can buy skins as you wish cs go open market !
1010,
1011,"More and more cheaters, too bad a fun game. [u]Idiots[/u] are happy that they hit other players on support, I do not recommend pity nerves."
1012,yeahhh
1013,"Decide to Re-install the game today just to have some fun and nostalgia.
ended up playing with bots because matchmakin taking to 5 minutes and no doy.
i really miss this game like it was used to be.

Goodbye blacksquad, uninstalled"
1014,"it really seems fun but, i cant play a game without being kicked for high ping, no matter what match I pick."
1015,Yes
1016,"Its good
"
1017,I Just Reimagine Old Games Tho xD
1018,"hahhah
"
1019,"> Just downloaded the game
> Expecting a gameplay, never intended to cheat or something

And the first thing i see, first time playing this game is ""access restricted for unfair activity"" - the game accused me of cheating. There is no gameplay, only a screen of falsely banned me the first time i play. Not a good move."
1020,"High ping auto-kick's you from the server, even if it was just a spike
Hard to find match because there are only a few players
"
1021,The only issue I have is with hackers.
1022,"طاط
"
1023,"Used to be great game when it was active. I played game called combat arms long time ago but it did get sold to Valofe... and this have been sold to Valofe too... cant say it have gone same route as Combat arms, too bad they blocked me there.. bastards...
Anyway this is still overall good simple shooter, I do return to this time by time while sipping a beer, all of the other free to play FPS I tried lacked something, this has that something. Overall - not great, not terrible."
1024,niceeeeeeeeeeeeeee
1025,but no :D
1026,GG
1027,I cant play it keeps crashing on the launch screen.
1028,Okay
1029,Just play valorant or csgo
1030,it fun
1031,at least one bot per game with some toxic players as well otherwise enjoyable
1032,"Fun asf
"
1033,Unstable game client. Game still crashing. Ingame updates is bullshit.
1034,Good stuff. Kinda dead.
1035,really good game for the most part hope it can make a come back but hackers need dealing with first but i have not ran into a hacker yet but i know there a lot more on this game then any other game so hope some day it make a come back but just have  to see but it only been 4 since game been out still has some time but idk see what happens.

1039,"First year after this game released, it used to be good but now. I rather to play minecraft with gun mod."
1040,-
1041,"this game sucks, cant change the server"
1042,As far as F2P games go this is gold. In A lot of ways CS:GO can learn from the map designs in this game. Only gripe I have is the menu layout sucks.
1043,Nobody will read this. So i'm gay
1044,"Trust me after 451 hours I regret playing this game the most it just gets worse and worse Buggy, Unrealistic, Cheesy, No good updates, Unbalanced teams, no reply to emails and finally my friend has bought a better PC so we can move away from this dying game. I hope this saves you guys from wasting your time by pressing the skip button."

1047,I saw the name and thought it was about gang wars very disappointed
1048,Nice
1049,Bring back memories.
1050,its a good well balanced game good anti cheat a lot like csgo except mechanics are a bit different high ping like 200 doesnt really make a big difference still playable and you can always find games any time of day

1093,"have had minor issues with lockups and game continuing to run when i attempt to log out at times, i still find its worth the effort to deal with that, graphics and game play otherwise are smooth and  look good suggest game to all players , just don't forget all games have issues give it time ,and don't give up to quick a lot players are better at it than you  but a lot are worse  , good time passer and decent players in game community .
found another issue ; for some reason i cant spend BS COIN on this game problem has persisted or several months 
 when i have enough to buy certain items using  BS type in game currency , a notice pops up saying i don't have enough to purchase it. even though i do .
 its a glitch that should be checked out,
I looked in discussions and support ,but found no answer that corrected the issue ."
1094,this game gave me depression.
1095,"My game stuck , couldnt close it even with task manager . im mad . This game ruined me . Thanks for the gun thou"
1096,dead game
1097,"This game is so, so, so random in so many ways.... I.E. getting a hit on anything else then 1st bullet is RNG. It feels like the bullets just go to random places in front of you(I think). And it does not matter if you press and hold or ""press,press,press"". Knife usage just as well you can get killed with 1 hit when you have full HP or they will knife you 3-4 times before you die. It does not matter if you use mouse1 or mouse2. Tactic - none. Get in and shi* ekhm shoot. If you are used to games like counter-strike or battle royale like APEX - dont play this - it will annoy you."
1098,Not that good in my opinion
1099,"not bad, but too many cheaters. unplayable"
1100,it's a miracle they can make a game this terrible
1101,idk what to say
1102,its crap
1103,"nice audio nice gameplay

"
1104,no
1105,It's so obvious that there are sooo many hackers and cheats in this game. Using aimbot wall hacks esp...etc.... It'd be nice if they devs did something about it.
1106,Bad game
1107,it doesn't run...
1108,i love cock
1109,very bad game
1110,"cheaters, hackers, and more cheaters.  the game used to be fun.  but now, there are multiple hackers in every game room.  they have wall hacks where they can see you coming through walls, they have aim hacks where they randomly shoot one shot and kill you with a head shot.

the battle eye system doesn't work.  i think it looks for cheats during the room start up.  that is why hackers leave the room when the session is done and rejoin when the session gets going.  make the rooms like the PVE area, once the session has started, don't allow anyone to join."
1111,gud fps game
1112,"It's a really great free to play.
The graphics are nice and the gameplay it's not bad.
It's a bit pay-to-win but it's ok.
It's not bad and it's worth your time if you are bored.
It's nice with friends."

1114,Shit game. Full of cheaters
1115,"after 30 minutes you can already start to see the problems with the game, it's p2w and feels like a csgo/cod mashup that just really doesn't work well. scope/ironsight feels weird imo and the game overall is just...mediocre, personally I'd say just don't even bother, there are free games out there that do this genre 10x better"
1116,sa
1117,This game is quite similar to Counter-Strike... good alternative version of CS
1118,Its cool call of duty cousin game i would definently reccomend if you  dont have that much storage and also its fast
1119,"Saw the game looked good, thought I could play with friends.

Well that was a waste of time and data.

Download the game, excited to play and I get met with "" detected unfair activities in your area "" error.
Confused and bewildered I log a support ticket to VFUN, to my surprise a quick response and the i read the response....

""Please avoid using applications that might affect the game."" So in short i am being called a hacker... 

Now to provide clarity to this. 
I am only running steam, I have discord running in the background so I can keep up with my chats and finally I have Spotify cause I generally have my own taste in music.

I then send this information back and have to open a new ticket as the old one was deemed resolved by calling me a hacker...

24h later the new ticket gets closed with a response of: ""(We will answer as soon as possible.)"" - this ticket is closed there is no way to respond.....I am left to open a new ticket in the hopes that I may get assistance for a game I was interested in.

Or I can leave this negative review letting others know that try the game at your own risk and expect to be called a hacker but the wonderful support staff of the in my personal opinion garbage company.

So in short, do not expect any sort of assistance from the support team or staff and hope you never have any issues with the game if you are even lucky enough to login."
1120,They ban legitimate players yet ignore hackers; no wonder people keep quitting.
1121,DEAD GAME :)
1122,Can y'all please add controller support
1123,"Played this game for over 3 years, met pretty awesome people, made friends and memories. And today i can not log into my account, because i am banned :D . Plenty of other super fair players also got banned

For what, you say? No freaking idea xD . Apparently if you are an okay player and you get enough reports from unevolved cryhards, you catch a ban. Mods are simply brick heads and have 0 idea about figuring out who is cheating and who is playing fair

So yeah, if you are good at fps and wanna have a quick fun stomping crybabies till you get banned for no reason, go ahead, the arena is yours, cuz the game is actually an okay game. Otherwise do not even bother with these abominations :D"
1124,"Well, in my opinion, it is very good that you make updates to put new skins and characters, what I did not think was good is to implement new bulletproof vests ..., by the way instead of put so many new things, worry about improving the recoil and how the characters run, it is something terrible and very mediocre on your part that today you do not even fix it, since if they fixed it, we would all play more comfortable, I have been playing this game for years and see how it is dying due to the fact that you do not pay attention or work to improve the comfort of the players It is a very painful thing, they should not worry so much about adding new skins, etc. Worry more about fixing and polishing the aforementioned, you must fix many things. At the moment I do not recommend this fps, since the recoil, how the character runs and his movement is horribly painful, in conclusion If you are going to work, work for the good of the players and the community and listen to her please. Thanks."
1125,Fuckin legit
1126,good game but ruined by hackers
1127,nice game but  clean the cheater
1128,csgo runs smoother but this feels more rewarding

1156,WELL ITS KINDA TWITCH Y BUT GOOD
1157,"good game

"
1158,Broken Dead Game Full of Cheaters and toxic people including their dev team
1159,good  fps
1160,better than csgo
1161,Its all about paying real money for op guns and girls with big boobs.
1162,"The game is still somewhat fun for now but devs seem to be trying to milk all they can by limiting what you can get with free currency and adding a ton of flashy skins and boxes instead of new content

Basically if you want satisfying shooting mechanics to play with for at most 2 hours a day this is worth trying but otherwise you can probably find something better (though since it is a free game so you cant really lose much by giving it a shot anyway)"
1163,"awesom game, however, even though my ping may be high , i play ok please dont kick"
1164,cool game/if you the graphics you can turn it up to your chosee 2 of the most beautiful graphics is high and ultra ither way good game
1165,bad
1166,yea
1167,no man
1168,good
1169,its cool
1170,Black Squid
1171,Take too long to search a match. I liked this game but due to long waiting it's becoming irritating now.
1172,is preaty normal but need more play dis game for be good player
1173,"Somehow people who hacks the game, can be kicked out of the room and rejoin the game like nothing has happen ..."
1174,"As a cs1.6 fan, I really like this game against csgo. I wish it had more players.

PROs: awesome graphics, big variety of weapons, NOT pay to win, constant patches for balance of weapons, smooth gameplay, weapons feel and sound very good, lots of gameplay mods (quick match, team deathmatch, capture the flag, competitive, 5v5, 2v2, 8v8, vsAI tower defence)
CONs: loot boxes mechanic, too few players, matchmaking is not new/casual-friendly

I would have strongly preferred to buy the game and live, than be free-to-play and die from micro-transactions.
I still like the game and recommend it to any patient to learn players."
1175,garbage
1176,I hope this game back to the first rules
1177,"Достойный представитель практически умирающего жанра онлайн FPS, Без pay to win, без всяких роялей. Единственное, что в этой игре требует доработки это механика стрельбы из снайперского оружия, из-за ее кривизны, этот класс практически не используется в реальных битвах, а жаль."

What kind of dipshits do they have on their team that makes that a thing?  Last game I played, not only were hackers running rampant (seeing/shooting through walls), but eventually you just lose your gun for no reason and you're given a stupid axe.  This game, and its devs, have become a joke."

1214,"Between pay to win AND obvious cheaters, you will probably QUIT the game and uninstall it like me.
I just left my last match ... like everyone in my squad.
There is NO point being a moving target for paying ppl AND cheaters.
And i'm not going to pay or cheat to join them.
To me it is a dead game.

1270,probably my favorite shooting game to be honest the leveling is a bit grindy but ive played this so much different missions you can do all kinds of guns and skins too
1271,Yes
1272,"50/50
"
1273,This game was fun for awhile but once you start learning the maps and guns of the game you start noticing things like how the head hit box is wacky (at times you shoot them in the chest and get a head shot) and there seems to be a server lag of sorts where people shoot at you but you go behind a wall and then die to them (tested with friends) no permanent grenade buy option always having to buy grenades from the store with cash or what not. its overall fun for awhile but has a lot of problems that just dont seem like the devs care to fix or dont know how to fix
1274,"It's been quite a while since I played this game, and back in the day when it had actual players, it was good, very good(I'm talking back in 2017-2018) Now it's just a shell of what it once was, the developers didn't care for much about the game and hackers started to plague the game....That's all, I quite liked the game, I invested a lot of time in it but my hopes for it to become something just died.

1286,Yea Yea yea its a nice game fun game recommended from me.
1287,"This is the worst PVP FPS I played in my life. And I played a lot (Fear Online, Warface, Warmode, Metro Conflict, First Assault...). 

Nothing, and I mean NOTHING is worth here! Progress system is crap, award system is crap, guns are terrible, map and level design are even worse. PVE? Basic horde mode as it gets! 

Gameplay? Well, if you like camping and you have no skills at all, this is the game for you. If you want brutal dogfight, look elsewhere! Oh, and hit-boxes are crap. I mean, 70% of your shots wont even register. Yeah, getting headshot in this game register maybe 1 out 50 times. Disaster.

On top of that, consider that this is dead game anyway. Low player base. And what is left is... I never saw more toxic people in one place, For some reason, it is ok for 0.8 kdr player to talk shit to you like he is godsend killing machine. 

Publisher/developer of this game is another joke. You have insane number of cheater running around and what do they do? They ban legit players!!! Let that sink in. Not cheaters, legit players.

So, hell no! You should not even think about playing this piece of crap. Play anything else."

Update: Coming back to 2021 and wanted to see if something changes.... Demnn Shet as ever.. Its still have its advantage and disadvantage. aiming the enemy on head takes 2 to kill em. REALLY? While They only take 1 bullet to kill me. Also the quick match takes Longer Than before. This game never changes. Tactical But those pay 2 win running around care free because they can't die easily Than those free 2 play players.... Shet game, Its never the same how it was before. Also the game is not really rewarding, Because like i said quickmatch is almost empty took me 30 minutes on joining one of the matches.

1363,"I thought this game was good, at first sight, but it was a massive letdown. The gunplay isn't smooth, unlike some other games, and the graphics aren't good at all, and i even have a nvidia geforce rtx 2080 graphics cars. So people with an average graphics card, you won't have a good time. Lastly it feels like a moblie game, as it's not smooth. If your looking for a free game, i would reccomend this game."
1364,"Straight out, I have to say NO to this game.

The screenshots are very deceptive as the game as a whole is very primitive. Even on ultra settings, what you really see is a bit dull, and meets the standards of a game released in 2004.

For some reason there is a frame rate choice (up to 200), and a refresh rate choice (60hz only). There is a refresh rate is selected even with VSync off... which seems a bit odd in the world of PC gaming.

It was hard to tell if the momentary stutters I experienced were based on that odd, forced refresh rate setting, or the game struggling to adapt to the aimbot cheaters, of which there are many.

The gunplay itself is very basic. Scoping is very fast, but also feels like it requires zero skill to play... and yet people stil feel the need to cheat.

The sound for footsteps is also infuriatingly bad, cheap, and distracting.

But worst of all is the psuedo Pay2Win weapon/item/etc. system. You have a basic set of permanent weapons (3 primaries, 1 handgun, 1 knife), while everything else is for rent. And EVERYTHING IS RENT ONLY. You can never choose a weapon you like and say, I will pay more to have this forever. No. You will have to keep renting your preferred loadout items.

To be fair, it looks like you can earn plenty of in-game currency just by playing to be able to keep renting your preferred items, but it feels so pointless. It also explains the rampant hacking, because that is the easiest way to find yourself flush with in-game currency with minimal investment of time.

There is also a battle pass, like so many games these days... and yet, the rewards even for the paid pass look so utterly unremarkable it leaves you questioning ""why am I supposed to make the effort?.""

As for the primitive movement and gunplay, this could have had some retro style charm, if it were not for the horrible sound, the somewhat uninspired levels (that I tried anyway), and of course, that horrible RENT system.

This game also takes up 8gb of space... I really do not understand why. That disk space is definitely NOT going to any hi-res textures, or the budget selection of sound effects... and it will remain an unsolved mystery... DELETE!"

1412,"One thing that I certainly like in Black Squad is that it has all weapons zeroed. I mean, you point your crosshair on the enemy, click once, and hit him like you were planned. And if you're wondering now, why it's even a thing to mention for an FPS game, well... then you've certainly NOT played Counter-Strike Global Offensive where all the guns shoot like they were made somewhere in Afghanistan or Pakistan private sector.

And the reason why I mention CS:GO in this review is quite simple, since Black Squad is the obvious free-to-play version of CS:GO, before Valve made it F2P as well. Also, at this moment you can't trade skins from Black Squad and other similar to CS:GO games via the Steam market. Because of economics. You know all those things like 'healthy competition' vs monopoly'. At one point Valve decided they do not want to have that competition and whoosh! - all items are gone. Maybe it was in some other way, I didn't exactly tracked it, being a single-play gamer through and through.

But, as of today, there are quite a few reasons to play Black Squad. It is the game that copied CS:GO way too precisely at some point... and then stopped evolving, while CS:GO didn't. Now, it's not only that Valve title is being F2P and solo-dominating the market of skins and other similar items, which some players can proudly wear and others will farm by playing CS:GO day and night long, to sell it to the first bunch for $$$. It's not all about money. It's about the variety of gameplay as well.

At this moment, Black Squad is a more-than-a-half-dead F2P competitive FPS where most of the players prefer not to go competitive but rather starting some shooting ranges versus bots. Yeah, the numbers of players online in this game are not really showing anything, because the most bunch will just play by themselves, versus dumb bots, which can be cleaved with scores like 50:1, rather than going competitive modes. Because of cheaters, because of the overall lack of players, because of lack of anything new going on, except some new skins in the in-game store... 

As I've said from the start, I kinda like gunplay in Black Squad, it is certainly better than in Counter-Strike. On the other hand, it is still far from perfect. You can't tune guns - change attachments or something. Also, there are some interesting maps, which you can try if you got bored with those that Valve provides in CS. But, other than that... it is hollow now.

So, as of mark, I can fairly give Black Squad at least 6.5/10. Maybe some time ago, even 1 point higher. But now, in 2021, there is no point to play the direct clone of CS:GO from the year 2017, when the CS:GO went ahead, and there are also so many other, more modern and/or more refined games on the market, even in the competitive FPS sector of it. May you rest in peace, Black Squad."

1431,Garbage free to play game that has compleatly brain dead players in it anti-cheat is a joke. my honest review of this game is Play warface : https://store.steampowered.com/app/291480/Warface/         if you ever feel like getting body blocked by a bunch of chinese kids on a 400$ Walmart pc then this is the game for you. Want to spend a stupic amount of money on guns that ar all the same this is the game for you. but dont worry they give you big titty anime characters to play so you can spin-bot in style.

I started with a nice 100% winstreak and after 5 games I was getting matched against ""Global Elites"" or cheaters. Teammates are absultely brain dead, can't use chat or voice or even play together. It's a complete flick shooter. Movement speed is 2x csgo (reminds me of Quake)... Sure, you get pretty nice guns, skins and quite fine maps, but the gameplay itself is terrible."

1499,"I stopped playing this for a bit in the hopes that it would get better....I was unfortunately wrong. The player base is low so it takes forever to connect to a game unless it's a custom one.
Another thing is that they have gotten so much worse and more scummy with trying to get money from people. Okay so for example, last time I played you could get the character Cherryl(or however you spell it) permanently from the shop along with a few other characters. So not that bad right? Well now that character and others are ONLY obtainable from lootcrates where you have a CHANCE to get them. Also most likely not permanently but only a few days to a week(heck they sell extensions now which also extend how long you can keep the character RANDOMLY to milk even more money from the players).
It's the same with weapons too for the most part, sure you could get some permanently...if you fork over that cash or grind for hours. 
The game is so terribly scummy now and cause the lack of people not that fun to play.
I would not recommend you get this game at all, but if you do don't waste your money on it."

I wont recommend this game to new players. There are a lot better games out there with better mechanics and promising future so dont waste your time and memory on black squad (not worth it) because of following reasons.
-> No reasonable in game rewards
-> No Esport future nor a past
-> No competitive players 
-> In game competitive is a joke
-> LOOOONG QUE TIMES (no player base)
-> No skin trading or market (Waste of money)
-> No Bans or wall of shame for cheaters
-> Anti-cheat system is broken (You will be kicked out of a game for a legit perfect headshot)
-> Broken mechanics (Your 50% will not register)
-> Hacks are easily available on forums
-> Doesnt matter if you have a good ping, You always have to play against laggers (Annoying)
-> No fair gameplay. (Beginners vs pros, legit vs hacker)
-> Milking money strategy (Pay a lot for skins or just fuck off)"

another downside is that there aren't really many people playing this game, which is unfortunate. So you may come across bots and stuff."

1621,good game lots of fun for the price it has it is a lot like counter strike but has a little bit of call of duty mixed in. The only thing to note is that when you get a something from the loot boxes you have only a certain amount of days to use that thing.
1622,"Black Squad has a great concept with the game, but the bots and veteran players have a HUGE, maybe too much advantage over the newbies;

Bots;
- Aimbot-like aim
- Weapons that are greatly advanced than ours (excluding veterans)
- Snipers camping each entrance to the middle of the map, always a headshot/bodyshot that takes 50 to 80 of your total HP with the normal body armor.

Weapons:
- Huge recoil
- Why 2 scopes on a Automatic Rifle???
- Deals a lot of damage to the standard body armor

Settings (can be set after the tutorial, but deserves this);
- Low Sensibility
...that's all to be honest.

But on the other hand, the graphics are great, concept too as i said earlier, and so are the skins. A true CSGO-Like, tactical and military game, but a bit unbalanced to the newbie side."

1626,"Trash game, by a trash publisher for trash gamers.
If you have any FPS skills whatsoever, avoid this game.
The level of retardation in the current playerbase will give you an aneurysm, and devs will ban you if you play too well (receive too many reports from people who can't tell their head from their arse). 

Valofe will not tell you why they ban you.
Valofe will not provide you any proof to support the ban.
Valofe will not provide an option to appeal the ban or to request an investigation.

Valofe does not want you to play the game - ""come, buy the ludicrously overpriced lootboxes and then please be on your merry fucking way. Thank you!""

And mods will shut down for any and all criticisms of the game or the company they represent - you will get banned from the steam forums, you will be banned from the official discord server, based on misconstrued interpretations of their RoC.

This game is not for you. This game is not for anyone.

1634,"Black Squad is a freemium ripoff of Counter Strike.  It's a basic military ""tacticool"" FPS arena shooter, requiring twitch reflexes and spending a lot of money on loot boxes. 

The games graphics are reasonable and the game displays nicely in 4K.  The netcode isn't perfect but it's smooth enough for some ""casual"" FPS twitch shooting in the small Counter Strike inspired arena maps.  There's a lot of anecdotal evidence about cheaters, ban happy admins, and a less than savoury community. 

I'd give this a ""maybe"" if Steam had that option, because it's free, it works well enough.   The issues with the administration of the game are one problem, and the other is that while this works well, games don't exist in a vacuum.  Battlefield and CS:GO massively outshine this, and while they cost more (or at least CS:GO used to), they're worth spending the money on for a better overall experience."
1635,"Do not download this game if you have any FPS experience. If you do not have brain damage and/or have two left hands you will get framed as a cheater by the playerbase. People will go out of their way to make sure you will get banned. These neckbeard scum of a playerbase even made a facebook full of ''suspected cheaters'' which is basically a list of very good players and a few cheaters.

The worst thing is that valofe bans you based on just their reports, false reports. It doesn't matter if they have zero proof, if enough retards report you cause you are better than them, your account will end up banned.

Do you ever happen to end up retarded after an accident, then i do recommend this game to you as you will versus people of your skill level.

Valofe deserves to go bankrupt.  Its a shame that a game with this much potential has gone to waste because of poor developers. Do not waste your time on this game."

1656,"After many years i keep getting the same issue even after many computers and dif ones. My game randomly freezes and stops responding randomly, lag when someone types in chat lag when the bomb is planted. Im talking about legit 15-20 second game freezes. 

I have come to a realization that this problem is not in my computers, i have a 1080ti and a good cpu. This has happened so many times in competitive makes me want to punch the monitor and for this reason im done. This was the last time I play it , im unninstalling it for good."
1657,"so gooods
"
1658,"Very well developed and designed game overall. There are small cons like i.e the kinda ""confusing"" GUI of the menus but apart from that I don't see many flaws in the game!"
1659,"There's a reason that Black Squad is one of the only active F2PMMOFPS games around these days. 

Ironsights, Combat arms, Survarvium, and so on, all of these f2p games have had their moment in the sun, some longer than others, but all of them suffer from terrible anti-cheat.

Battleye here finally shows some spine and I have NEVER seen so many hackers get instantly struck down with the wrath of god so quickly as in this game.

And it makes me wonder, people complain about Battleye being an invasion of privacy, and my only response to that is ""What do you have to hide?""

There's people who slip through or you'll occasionally have to leave a room due to an aimbot the system hasn't picked up on, but it's not 100% walls all the time every game like in Ironsights. You don't have people just randomly peeking you from the back every single time you spawn, and when it does happen you can physically SEE them being banned.

It does right by it's players by giving them a place to actually PLAY THE GAME in a fair way and that's something no other MMOFPS has even attempted to do.

Even in games like R6 Siege and Cold War, you feel like you have to constantly hawk over your enemies to make sure they're playing fair, and then HOPING something gets done when it's reported and that the system pays attention, which it often doesn't. 

THIS SINGLE ASPECT ALONE makes me enjoy playing this game more than Call of Duty.

Gameplay wise, if CS:GO had gunplay like this I'd be playing every day, despite the toxicity."
1660,Not a bad free to play shooting game with friends
1661,"was scammed plain and simple. was given a free crate in that crate i got another crate that needed a gold key to open, i buy the key and says i don't have enough keys to open the crate, i go into the store and buy 3 more keys and says i still don't have enough keys, 3 hours late the keys i paid for with my money is removed from my account. fine keep they damn money. and also support is non existent, i would charge back but it would impact my steam account and its not worth it."
1662,"This game had the potential to be fun, for about 15 minutes, at some point in 2017. The devs sold the soul of the game for tendies, and have now reduced the game to bloatware with a crosshair."
1663,"With pay-to-win equipment unlocks, infuriating regional restrictions and bland gameplay, Black Squad does an excellent job of reminding us why free-to-play games are rarely worth our time."
1664,this game is so good you can try it once
1665,i love
1666,I love the game but I hate one thing . You can't access all Guns at first
1667,very good game with good graphics
1668,Played it like 388 hours and get banned for nothing. Their support didnt even give me the reason why i was banned. The message is saying unfair gameplay. No supports and they just ban people randomly i dont know why... I contacted support they say they cant show evidence of my ban...!!! why?!! why u ban without any proof? why dont u have any reliable anticheats who make differance between innocent clean players out of cheater ??!!

1686,"buggy gameplay, the game is stuck at 30 fps, crappy copy of CSGO better play that instead. Waste of time."
1687,So. This is game. Game about guns. Guns and uh. Other people. And they fight. And their is some green people and then red people. And they fight. And they fight at the uh. The places. Where things are. And then they fight. And yeah so they really just fight at places that has things.
1688,"This game is fun like Crossfire , i like FPS with Skins most of items are usefull i love Scar Heavy and M4a1 that reflex laser is cool

This game is very good optimized you can run at 300 fps easily and most important you can play compettive ,

Level up and rewarding for your time

If you have friends go for it .. create a clan and go .. or premade group

You know what is better than rest of fps games ,, smoke is really nice in this game .. i use my smoke and is Blue

Enjoy and remember GIT GUD
Better aim =more kills"

1690,"Used to be a fun game.... they removed different skins for different ranks in competitive mode, so now everyone pretty much works for the same crap and they also do not give them out permanently anymore. Having different tiers of ranks get different skins permanently was atleast a small thing to work toward...  Every update they release some new skins, half the time it looks like they are made by a 12 year old, which is probably a compliment at this point.  Highly doubt they advertise this game, you will barely find a lot of NA rooms. The game is maybe 6/10, the company most definitely doesnt care about its community. The game itself is good but has more potential if they werent so busy milking its player base and removing everything the community cares about. Overall, its a good time waster if thats what your looking for, but prepare to be lagged by high pingers who do not like to stick to their own servers."

I'm not saying this out of nowhere in fact i'm saying this based on my own experience as a player who spent 3100+ hours in this game and uploaded bunch of frag movies in my youtube channel and still got banned manually banned for cheating (even tho i never ever cheated or tried to and if u watch my videos and see how i play you would definitely say that i'm not) also didnt get banned from anticheat as u can see my profiile has no VAC bans wich means i was manually banned with no proof provided from the devs :)))

1770,"They're just blanket banning good people now without any evidence because the higher ranks were full of rampant cheating... Also downgrading servers, and item trading was disabled ages ago too. 

If the game wasn't dead before, now it definitely will be. I'd suggest staying away from it, but if you decide to play anyways, absolutely avoid microtransactions considering you could get banned just for performing well and getting reported by bad players."
1771,this game is bad. really bad.
1772,"This game used to be the best F2P FPS on steam, but as soon as FAILOFE took over it went to shit real fucking fast. Disabling market, ruining the balance, downgrading servers, fucking with the netcode.
And most importantly, blanket banning whole clans, and good players that are hackusated and wrongly reported by bad/average players that can't tell the difference between a good player and someone who cheats.
Don't you even dare to have a good match and a positive KD, you will get banned! And i am not even exaggerating here. Players who have been playing for years, who are not cheating, who are in good standing with the competitive community - disregard all that, some scrubs reported you, you will get banned. Without proof, without nothing.
This game is dying. If you are desperate for a game to play and still want to try BS, regardless of what i wrote, don't even think about spending any money on it. You will lose it all when you get banned."

1856,"Free to play. First person shooter. Squad vs squad. Typical death match game play with nothing special to talk about. Sound generic? Because it is, in every possible way. Someone basically just looked at what was popular and skinned their own version of it.

Notable differences? Well, there's less players than most, the maps are pretty routine  and dull and the anti-cheat might as well not exist so you can pretty much expect to encounter cheaters when you do bother to play.

While technically the game is functional and you can achievement grind it easily enough if you are just wasting time, there's simply no actual reason to recommend this over any other routine free to play first person shooter that just goes through the motions of existing.

Bottom line: If you made a list of Counter Strike clones, this would be on it.

1862,.
1863,"I used to play this with my boys back when the game just started. We even rent PCs from computer shops just to be able to play together. Now that I have my own PC, I tried to get back to it to reminisce the old times but it's just not the same anymore.
Lesser players, experience worsen. We used to just queue in to a random TDM and in just a matter of seconds, we got a game already. Now, been in queue for more than 5 minutes and still nothing.

I also found out that the game doesn't offer permanent guns anymore. Everything has a limit of 30 days. I don't know why they did that. I just found out about it recently when I was trying to buy new guns.

They mix up servers in Custom Game rooms so ping is skyrocketing sometimes.

I used to look at it as the best FPS ever, but not anymore. I'm sorry."

1875,"*Disclaimer, I have many hours on this game on a another account*

For those of you who remember Combat Arms, an FPS created by Nexon.
Combat arms was wildly successful on its freeplay platform

As time went on the Korean company plagued the game with micro transactions & NEVER fixed the cheater problem. 
Combat Arms eventually failed & was bought by a different publisher- Valofe.

This is a Combat Arms re-skin and is failing for the same issues. MTX & hackers. Do they even pay for battle eye?

It's crazy. if these Korean publishers weren't so cheap, they'd actually have a dedicated player base"

1886,"Well, I was enjoying the time I got to spend with my amigo. I continued to get into the game and play it and these mfs banned me from the game I never cheated in. Tried to go to support website and it wouldn't let me log into it. I could've spent my extremely valued money on this game and got scammed. I am not lying about any of this. L o l. This made my day"
1887,"a very good game. wish they had a option to change the AI,s difficulty"
1888,It's a fun game to play
1889,"VALOFE !! One of the worst companies on this planet !!! it took one of the best if not the best shooter competitive game on steam and turned it to the worst !! manual bans if you are good then ip ban if you are really good then ip ban + HWID ban if you are playing since beta and you master a specific weapon and you get nice aim and headshots so you are not allowed to play anymore because you are too good for the new players !! then you ask the game ok match me with pro players the game answers ok we don't have them because they left the game or they are offline then you ask ok is that my mistake ? then they tell you to stfu because you are not spending money. ok VALOFE why should I spend even 1 cent if i am afraid to get permanently manual banned any second!!! it was a legendary game but sadly Valofe rust ruined it !!!!. steam market closed updates including only skins nothing else, full of bugs, even old bugs since 2019 like throwing nades and smokes but you can't because the nade or smoke will stick to your hand for some reason. c4 defusing bug that even if you are faking the defuse the BIG ''defusing bomb'' phrase will stick in the middle of your screen and you wont be able to see anything. changing recoil pattern over and over every update and changing gun's damage every season, plus the recoil and damage of the same gun can be different from mode to another. actually there is so many things to say but the worst of the worst the mind blowing support center OMG they are a joke !! they 100% lazy mods !! they don't care they don't answer they have a bot to answer the tickets I have over 4000 hour on this game i don't even play any other games only black squad but for anyone who see this i won't say black squad i will say VALOFE doesn't deserve your time don't even try it. and for any company or any business man who want to invest i say this is your chance black squad has the feel that no other game has the movement the guns the play style it's just perfect for a shooter 5v5 competitive game it just needs some good management and it's ready to be on the top !! and for VALOFE there is 0.000000000000000001 chance that you are reading this review but if you are reading i am very happy to tell you F**K YOU   O.O"

1902,
1903,"If you need a new game with good gameplay and grafic, this game is not for you. Well the game is good, but it will probably soon die away, because of the dev's. why? They deleted the market place, idk why. They Deleted Global chat, probably because of Toxicity, but if i am toxic, i will spam that guy in his whispers and whats more toxic do i ask?

side note: i will still play it, cuz i aint got another new game."
1904,"Go ahead and call me a coward and say I'm not strong
Because I'm not like you
Go ahead and call me crazy cause I live in a maze
Tell me how about you?
I think I live in my head, sometimes I think that I'm dead
I hide behind my youth
No, I been losing my mind and I'm a little behind
Step inside my shoes
Cause I've never been happy with myself
And I don't need no one feeling bad for me
Trying to offer me pity and throw jabs at me
Wanna give me advice and then laugh at me
Behind closed doors
Just close the door, let me be by myself
Just me and myself
I'm tired of living, I cry, I hear it's easy to die
I wanna see for myself
And I know that sounds crazy to everyone else
But I'm depressed as fuck
Stressed as fuck
Ain't no medicine that could cure what's the test as drugs
I mean, I need extra love
And that ain't even enough
'Said that ain't even enough
And where the fuck is God? (God, god)
Damn, maybe I ain't believing enough
But today we gonna see if he's real
And if he is, I guess I'm probably going to hell
Look, I ain't wanna die like this
I ain't picture my life like this
They don't know what it's like like this
Pretending I'm happy so I can smile like this
And laugh like you
Sometimes I wonder if I ever act like you
Could I finally fit in and maybe relax like woo
Or would you feel lost without me?
Cause honestly, I think the world is better off without me
And my mind's spinning, this is the line finish
Truth is, I don't care how they feel about my feelings
I made up my mind, I'm going out like Robin Williams
I guess I'm not the Ordinary People of John Legend
And I've been suicidal since the day I was nine, shit
Okay, the day I was nine
I've been tired of being bullied, couldn't stay out the fire
Grandma told me I should take it one day at a time
And damn it, look at me now, fuck
Fuck, pens runnin' out
Shit, fu—, ugh
Look, just know it's a new day
But if you reading this
Then it's probably too late, blaow!

Just make sure you tell my family
It's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry
So much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry
So much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family
It's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry
So much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry
So much weighing on me

I hope you got what you wanted
I hope you finally happy
It's too late for you
Been going out of my mind
You don't know how many times that I done prayed for you
I hope you hear me, goddamn it
Cause I got so much shit that I wanna say to you
I used to shine, now I'm all in the dark
I remember I used to tell you to follow your heart
But goddamn it, look at you now, it's all of your fault
How could you?
Maybe it's my fault
I shoulda paid more attention to what you been doing
Maybe I should have been more of an influence
I can't believe that you're dead, I fu-
I read your letter and all I could do is have mixed feelings about it
But I'll forever be attached to you, damn
Part of me feels bad for you
A part of me feels like you weak and I'm mad at you
And I don't mean to be insensitive
But I don't understand how we couldn't prevent this shit
You took the easy way out
Goddamn it, you dead
I mean, look what you did
I'm so fucking upset, how could you be so selfish?
Nigga, how could you be so selfish?
Now you're gone, you done left me so helpless
I wonder what God thinks
I hope you in God's place behaving yourself
Yo, what the fuck you gotta say for yourself? (say for yourself)
Look, I really feel lost without you
I hate the fact you think the world is better off without you
And my mind's spinning, this is the line finish
Truth is, I don't care how you feel about my feelings
And I'd be lying to you if I told you I'm fine, listen
I know that you can hear me, all I need is like five minutes
I just wanna reach inside the casket and pull you out
I'm sorry this isn't something that we both could figure out
I wish I could hear you now
Is your soul missing?
I wonder if you could do it again, would you do it different?
Tell me what death is like
Was it meant for you, brodie?
Did the heaven support it?
Are you fucking happy now?
Did you get what you wanted?
Isn't this what you wanted?
I feel the temperature falling
And you've been suicidal back day you were nine?
Yeah, even back then, you was nine
We was living on the edge, couldn't stay out the fire
Grandma told us we should take it one day at a time
And damn it, look at you now
Shit, but it's a new day
And if you can't hear me, it's probably too late
Fuck

Just make sure you tell my family
It's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry
So much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry
So much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family
It's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry
So much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry
So much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family
It's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry
So much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry

Over all Good game.
I would have been happy to buy this game if it had single-player/story mode content."
1912,"The game is fun to play with friends, but it still has a lot of loopholes and thing to fix including the Anti-cheat error that appears from nowhere and force you to quit the game, or the Hackers that ruin your game and give you a bad game experience, however the game is fun to play and i recommend it as long as Valofe fix all problems."

1929,"This game was a lot of fun, but unfortunately they seem to have fucked it... different types of body armour? reduce damage to certain weapons but no visual que to help someone identify what body armour they have on so it's trial and error for atleast 3 rounds... and thats just the beginning of issues."

1938,"Black Squad, is gameplay wise one of the best free to play shooter on steam in my opinion, problem is that due to the small population of the game, it gets very tedious.
Here are the two biggest problems:

Cheater:
After you got in depth with the game itself and its community youll find many people cheating or getting boosted by cheats.  New accounts, name changes, people with 10 diffrent accounts, buying and selling accounts. The biggest known names skillwise related, been banned bcs of cheating. Its actually a - s h i t h o l e - I wouldnt want anybody to invite to. There are very few clans or communitys that didnt got any players banned over the last years and didnt profited of them over this time. I would be astonished if there were just a single esport tournament held (back then when they still happened) that were'nt rigged bcs of people participating that got banned some days/weeks/months later. The first Major Cup held, was won by our clan for europe, bcs the opponent team in the finals got 2 cheating players disquallified. Let that sink in. The tournament that I myself did, would not have been possible to win if our second matchup out of five hadn't been disquallified for corrupted moss-files(anitcheat). Its actually insane. Almost any of our members can tell you a similar story they experienced while aquiring their calling cards(a reward for winning cups, displaying your win). Since its free to play, the anti-cheat - s h i t - , the support overwhelmed, the community kids - its just too easy trying to cheat for their rank, prizes, clan prestige or stats (K/D) and getting away with it. For fuck sake, i bet most people start cheating in the first place because of how many cheater they encounter once they start playing serious. You will run into the same suspicious people over and over again, ruining your fun.

Ping:
This topic is another problem related to the small population of the game. If there were more people playing in your region it would be less likely to happen that you get matched up with high pinged opponents. The gameplay is prone to be negativley affected by it due to its fast movement, the first two shots are almost 100% accurate with any rifle for example. That leads to fast unexpected plays that compliment more on aiming than setup. With a higher ping you'll be able to see a waiting player when pushing around a corner earlier since his postion is settled in response to the server, while yours takes longer to update. When they fist released the new rank Dragon(3000elo) the first person to reach it, has been commonly known for having a 175 ping in our region and casually lagging through matches owning people. It was even so bad that you could see in his own produced footage (on youtube), that opponents often died - s e c o n d s - after he killed them. Nowdays its not possible anymore in ranked to create lobbys with more than 2 players but back in the day that was aswell an often used method to push your elo and getting easier matches, by queing with players of diffrent continents and playing with high ping. But you will run into that kinda stuff in any custom game, quick match(public) or cup held ofc.

(Game got sold to a diffrent studio, they seem to care more and even changed some major stuff game is playing a bit diffrent now (some good, some bad stuff) and I even heared people got banned, but ofc doesnt change the core fundamental problems I just stated.. that much)

1958,its pretty cool
1959,"It is technically good, nice graphics, nice gamemodes and similar to strategy games like Rainbow 6 and CSGO; but [b]it encorporates the characteristics of the other common F2P shooters, loot boxes and all of that[/b]. It is a good game none the less, but if I wanted to play strategical, competitive shooters I would rather play Counter Strike."
1960,smg power
1961,"game is messy, menu is hard to navigate, no one plays it. It's fun with bots until you get sniped when you go around corner with 3 enemies there and no time to react. just go get counter strike global offensive, there may be some hackers but the prime status upgrade is $15 and it is actually competitive."

1974,very god game
1975,ok2
1976,still a very good game but what is going to kill it is the new dev team not taking feed back from what is left of the player base and its going to just go down hill from here unless thay take feed back and do something right for once if not then rip yet one more very good game gone do to a dev team makeing very bad calls
1977,Daca vrei sa ramai fara tastatura și monitor e jocul perfect  xD

1980,Counter Strike but with juicy anime girls
1981,its dead lol
1982,"Its not a deviation but what it lacks in originality it makes up for in presentation and the changing of normal weapon stats. I think if you like fps shooters, this is one of the best free ones."
1983,"Pretty cool, i started out yesterday and i have a mint karambit and some other kinda cool skins. I didnt have to pay for them, idk if i lucked out with playing during somekind of event, but constant free skins seems too good to be true."
1984,amazing
1985,download game play 10 second = ban what a good game enjoy guys
1986,"Back in the '00s I would trawl the ""untamed"" Internet for free games.  Abandonware, freeware, shareware, F2P games before they were the modern definition of F2P (while still being loaded to the brim with microtransactions).  Black Squad is basically the modern equivalent of one of those.  

If you know what I mean, then you know exactly what kind of FPS Black Squad is.  These games have a certain *feel* to them that's almost like OG Counter Strike but with a few quirks and twists that make it feel just enough like a fresh take on the usual gameplay loop.  You'll eventually run into the South American guy who's been playing for two decades.  Weird voice acting and translation.  There's a dozen different currencies depending on the time of day and what events are running.  Weapons have time limits that count down in real time if you're playing or not.  Maps are designed for TDM/Gun Game and S&D/Demo.  

It's cheap. Free. It feels like it, plays like it, sounds like it.  You should know what you're getting into.  That being said it's a great way to kill some time and quick to pick up.  I'd recommend it for that alone."
1987,"Completely unbalanced, can't even change the aim setting to hold instead of click."
1988,It's like nobody plays this anymore I can't even join a match
1989,I CANT CLOSE THE GAME ITS BEEN ON FOR 56 HOURS WTF
1990,i have a problem .. why does the game kick me out every 2 minutes :{
1991,Not worth it. Just go play cs go or crossfire. Also insanely toxic community
1992,Man this game is awful. Every match is like the worst corner peeking head glitching circa 2008 COD dtm. But every single match is that. The guns are bland. They tried to split the middle between CS GO and COD. Which is like trying to find the middle between hot and cold. It's lukewarm. Nobody likes lukewarm. It's nothing in a bland box. Enjoy.
1993,must have game
1994,good
1995,good game !
1996,"Hitboxes are messed up and so is the recoil and gunplay, you are far better off installing combat arms rather than play this game lmao"

2029,"I can tell it is a good game if you are just a casual player and look for fun (or maybe not even that, because from what I have heard, there are a lot of cheaters lately), but if you are the type of person who seeks for a good skilled and competitive game, this is not the one you are looking for."
2030,"Not recommend this game, this game is not fun any more."
2031,Fun Game
2032,fun game
2033,good one
2034,"i played almost 1k hours in this game , the game is total trash now , their updates are only for skins for the past 3 years and updates are new skins only , game have bad graphics / animation / gameplay , dont get me starting about theri noobs comp matches , i would play this game couble years ago but now it is dead game"
2035,i love
2036,gud gameeee
2037,Play valorant instead only thing this game has going for it are the skins
2038,"Broken ass game, thats all i have to say"
2039,mmm
2040,i like it
2041,I love it for have it many types of the shooter games. Have it many types of the guns.
2042,"its epic, i like it at least"
2043,I shited
2044,tec reload
2045,"The devs stopped caring ages ago, so it's nothing but cheaters and whales. Don't waste your time with this garbage."
2046,"csgo+cod best thing wish i could have played this sooner will 100% play this alot
"
2047,"The game could be ok if: They re-balanced all of the weapons, got a new anti-cheat, fixed the various bugs and glitches, replaced all of the maps, added skill based matchmaking to stop new players getting destroyed by sweats, streamlined the menus, improved the server stability and it would also help if they had a set art style and got rid of all the anime skins."
2048,They butchered this game
2049,csgo x cod

2058,"Wirklich ein gutes game um mit freunden ein paar runden zu spielen, als main game eher nicht empfehlenswet da es sehr oft sich wiederholt vom Gameplay her. es gibt eine Gute Waffenauswahl, viele verschiedene Modi zum zocken und die Grafik ist top!

Empfehlenswert."
2059,It's fun game
2060,Free games are worthless. except for CSGO in which you might have a competitive match.  Anti  Cheat software is a complete hoax. It told me that my RGB Software  was cheating software that only controls my LED lighting. Seriously.  Let this game die. Cheating is like a child that is trying to learn how to ride a bicycle with training wheels but the child never takes them off and learns how to ride the bike without a crutch.
2061,great free shooter game. runs great havent had any problems with it at  all
2062,"The new update is bad.
With the new update, many players will leave the game including me.
And the game was already dead, but now, no one will play it anymore."
2063,"Yea, no. This game just ain't good anymore. This game had alot of potential, the devs did not listen to their community. Now global chat is disabled and marketplace is disabled. That is it for me, i have zero faith that they will ever make this thing work. They prolly will just try to grab as much as they can from the burning game."
2064,love
2065,this game suck !
2066,"Does not work on linux, it was a good game wen i had windows."
2067,"Way back in 2018, the game used to be popular and fun. Playing matches with friends was a great way to spend my time. There were weapons to work towards unlocking in the medal shop, and I even spent a bit of money on some of the first release packages; things like the AK12, AK47, SR15, and M4 Custom release packages as well as the first DLC they ever released for a lot of starting guns.Taking a look now, the game is dead (at least in NA). All the cool players who used to play have left the game. Only gamemodes you can Quick Play are TDM, 8v8, 16v16, and occasionally a 5v5. Most of the times I get these matches, they're filled with SA players with super high ping. Apparently servers were merged? Anyway, give up on trying to find a competitive match, at no point was I able to find a match, no matter how long I waited.Now they're shoveling out currency that was hard to come by in the past, for winning 1 match in different modes (some of which you'll be lucky to find a match for regardless). Not worth putting any time or money into in my opinion, and this is coming from a former decent spender.Shame. Maybe if they manage to get more players, and deal with what I'm hearing from current active users is a huge anti-cheat problem, then maybe I'll come back someday."
2068,not the best but good

2085,Very fun
2086,"i really enjoyed this game... overall the game is very nice i would prefer them to add a sprint option like on any other fps game. ive either miss that button or there is none other than that i enjoyed it. The guns are nice the recoil can use a bit of an upgrade,if you have been jamming warzone of BF then the recoil will frustrate you. Other than that a solid FPS"

2103,"I Just had a craving for a first person shooter and decided I would look at the free to play section, this game tickled my fancy, do you hear me.

I Load the game up and I am greeted with a main menu that looks like fucking Facebook from 2012, it even has a built in messenger even though its on steam. 

This is all before I have even loaded into a match, which I then proceeded to do, every single gun plays exactly the same, every single scope has a different model but zooms you in the same amount (1.5x) 

And then out of nowhere there are fucking samurai swords in a first person shooter. Just download csgo.

I didnt pay for this game as it was free to play, but for some reason I want my fucking money back."
2104,"kinda
"
2105,Lowkey fun its like if csgo and call of duty had a baby
2106,Best Head Shot sound in Steam
2107,Simple and beautiful. Beginner friendly.
2108,"I just made it a ""no"" answer cuz this game deserves to get shat on, but it's still good enough to recommend at a steep price of free. pretty good shooting, with small maps and quick game-modes for good in-and-out style play, and rewarding daily, weekly and bonus missions that will give you a ton of the loot you'll be missing out on, if you play enough. I wouldn't know about competitive tho. 

This game locks a bunch of stuff behind paywalls tho, and while many items are acquirable nonetheless, a greater many are not. This becomes an issue when you consider the greatest flaw of this game:

It's semi-regularly difficult to tell enemy characters from friendlies due to both factions dipping into the colors and shapes of one another, the most egregious example being a peace girl having a big white shirt on and lighter colored hair while their faction is dark green and the other faction is bright white, 

Also the game keeps telling me to play AI defense but you can't really clear them without a teammate, and you're also not allowed to ""invade groups of two"" or some bull.

However, unlike a lot of games that fall into the same ""free game syndrome"" trappings, this one does not keep your rewards from you. loot boxes aren't rigged to make the few ""permanent"" rewards absurdly rare, i.e. CS:GO knives. I've opened a whole lot of free boxes (medal rotation, old, weapon, etc.), which each have an absurd amount of rewards to pull from, so I can't talk on their chances, but of paid ones, about 15, and I've been given 2 permanent weapon skins, but random chance is random, so take that as you will, and this system shouldn't be here to begin with, so doing it well is not cause for applause.

Also this game's population here (US) is pretty small, but more than enough to populate a few servers. The korean devs lump us together with the entire American continent, too, but I guess we do that to them so we totally had it coming."
2109,"yes of course
"
2110,es bueno porque me entretiene hahaha
2111,OK
2112,mantul
2113,This game sucks
2114,hayal kırıklığı
2115,"I have (controller companion) but i does not work on this game. Yet it works on everything thing else.
love the graphics so far, only done tutorial, shame I'm not any good with a keyboard and mouse."
2116,this is good game
2117,"Used to be fun, have some golden memories in the game, its terrible now, wouldn't recommend to anyone."

2119,this game raw af i play it everyday bro no cap I need some friends to run with
2120,really good game just good even if your playing on a toaster
2121,really fun and immersive
2122,ну так игра на пару часиков
2123,"Used to be my fav FPS game on steam, But its soo bad now. 
Like i have like 80 hours in this game but still i wont recommend."
2124,a
2125,"Might be good if you have a low-end PC.

Other than that, the first 4 games I played all had hackers. Would not suggest, sadly."
2126,"it's simple and I feel like it combines a ton of fun games and  does it well, the one thing i'm not a fan of is the way a getting guns. Other than thats it's a pretty solid game."
2127,"If you are looking for a new game that perhaps will refresh you and you like RPG games in general, then this game is for you. At this moment is hard to rate the game, however, the game feels as if you would combine both CSGO and Team Fortress 2 in one game. This what you will experience. The game is fairly new, therefore expect new updates/patches incoming soon 💯"
2128,"It's good, would really recommend this"
2129,nice game
2130,Good Game.
2131,good
2132,GGGGGGGG
2133,"Dont waste your time, from the little hours i have the game is like, *no*"
2134,This game is great! Sadly playerbase is dropping..
2135,"Well.. This is a tough one...
I would recommend you the game if you will play only you vs. bots, but if your going against players, don't even attempt to.. In whichever server you join you will find a hacker and it's pretty much impossible to have a fair server without hackers, if you somehow manage to find a hacker-free server, then you will be bombarded with spawn campers.

Reasons why I like the game:

1. Good Graphics, nicely optimized.
2. Good game-play and mechanics
3. Simple controls, easy to get a hang off.

Reasons why I don't like the game:

1. Should you get this game?
A: No no you shouldn't.
2. Is it a hacker and spawn camper infested game? 
A: Yes it is. 
3. Do the devs to anything about this?
A: No, not at all.."
2136,It's a very nice game!

2155,Keyifli
2156,It's fun but sometimes the game sucks as hard and you want die that's the only thing in the game
2157,just another crappy cod clone like iron sight or warface
2158,nice game but is pay2win. even grenades should be bought. u basically have only 1 or 2 guns
2159,high ping even you have good internet connection hahaha
2160,not reccomended when you've weak Wifi coz auto disconect and thats so shit
2161,Good Game good graphics but its takes time to find match.
2162,"This game looks and plays like a mobile port.

The controls make no sense. You'll have to rebind them.

The UI blows my mind how cluttered and unintuitive it is.

To have guns and equipment in the game, you have to pay a subscription to use them.

It's a twitch shooter, not a skill based or tactics based shooter. I don't like CS:GO or CoD for these reasons and both CS:GO and CoD do it better."
2163,very positive for free game!!
2164,i really like this game although it has some issues 4/5.

2173,"Amazing <3 
"
2174,"С данной игрой знаком, еще с ее беты.
Проект бы стал определенно успешным.
Но к сожалению есть ряд главных причин почему эта игра умерла:
1 -большая разница в пинге дает приимущество игроку живущему рядом с сервером
2 - частая анимация не регистрации урона по противнику(не фиксится с релиза продукта)
3 -постоянные вылеты, особенно много проблем появляются после каждого обновления
4 -очень плохая оптимизация
5 -огромное кол-во ненужной косметики мешающей или наоборот дающей преимущество врагу
6 -бесполезные, частые тех работы
7 -отсутвует видимый ребаланс оружия в мете 

Также сущетсвует ряд плюсов корейской игры:
1 -большое разнообразие режимов игры и карты под каждую из них
2 -куча разнообразного оружие и чаще эффективного 
3 -интересные вариации актуальных скинов
4 -динамичные бои(особенно ракнкинг)
5 -локальное и дружное( не всегда) комьюнити
6 -бесплатная, что является низким и незатратнным порогом игры

К сожалению с происшествием 3 лет с официальной даты релиза игры, существенные минусы все время мешают насладиться полноценным геймплеем. Не сказал бы, что печален потерей, но чисто, как завсегдатый геймер, хотел бы процветания уже никакому, но достаточно любимому проекту,

Попробовать всегда стоит, хотя бы повеселиться с другом
Удачи ;)

p.s. очень много нервов успела потрепать

2178,Spent way too much time on this game. It got bad.
2179,"Already my favorite shooting game. While using the same format as games like cs:go, this game feels more free and comfortable to move around in, but not as jumpy as overwatch. The style of the guns gives of a nice feel when shooting."

2200,Good!
2201,good combat
2202,"It's absolute shit. I've been playing this game for a while, so I have a right to say so. There are no footsteps in the game because holding Shift cancels out all footstep movement, the guns are either over powered or pea shooters, physics are messed up, only can shoot through some walls, the only gave attention to the tutorial cinematic which is still pretty shit, and it's a blatant CSGO knock off. If you want to get a better game, buy CSGO or R6 Siege, but this game is crap. There is a reason why it's free."
2203,this game is more good then fortnite
2204,its a fun game to play but i got a balisong long time ago now i cnt even sell it on market whats wrong

2217,"It's invested with modders, matchmaking are just so damn broken and takes too long. Just get CSGO and play in community server, it's a lot better."
2218,"Easily in my top ten favourite games. 

The guns sound great and are super easy to use. The music is pretty cool, the character movement is pretty fluid as well. The only things I would change are the option to permanently equip weapons to a slot instead of having them for a 7 day period and the UI could be improved a little more. 

Still, a great little shooter"
2219,"I think 98% left the game because Black Squad removed the Steam Market. 
The game has potential, unfortunately not that many play it anymore.
"
2220,"This is garbage, dont waste your time"
2221, trash game banning pro players and keeping the real hackers
2222, if u have a poo poo pc this is a ok fps game
2223,"Great game, for a WELL DESIGNED FREE TO PLAY FPS game."
2224,"Yes.
"
2225,Too many hackers and lagging is big issue.
2226,"This game is cold garbage and everything about it is terrible. It is free for a reason because no one would play this game at all, the only reason I would play this game because it was free until the new administers ruining this game even more then it was. Unless you have a really good PC and WiFi connection I would  not recommend playing because you would be kicked and sometimes crash for just trying to play one single game. When I was trying to play one game in my U.S. server I would get kicked for just playing for a few mins or even seconds.  I would not recommend playing this game at all and look for a different game."

2235,"i got a 60$ skin from a free lootbox from this game and bought myself siege, pretty based

honestly pretty good, but I don't see why would you play this over other games"
2236,very cool
2237,free cod
2238,"(updated 08/2021 and 11/2021)

Avoid this game!!! Not playable at all anymore :

-hit reg is bad, every single game you get no regs, even bot tdm
-laggers with 150-300 ping (asian players abuse VPN and play EU server to get ez kills)
-not working anticheat so theres cheaters (all bans manual if someone has time to report)
-support wont help at all or gonna fix problems
-theres not rookie channel
-no game balance so probably you get most braindead ppl in team and lose agains full clan

and for bonus Valofe start banning innocent players/clans without reason (support wont even bother to answer why get banned), and Valofe has make this game spray and pray."
2239,Best fps shooter game in free.
2240,7/10. I miss the old Black Squad.

But the only thing about it is that when you against will players you have to be good at the game or you will die rage.Another good thing about this game is that you can easily kill someone with a AR or you can one shot to the head with a sniper. And this game is free on steam, and it will not scam you if you buy something on it."

2284,Sadly this game is going down (player count kept declining).

2287,fucking bad game!

2289,And now suddenly after years of playing there is a ping restriction. I feel like I have wasted my time and money on this game. Cannot play at all. I wonder how many other players spent on this game and got kicked out for not being close enough to the server. Ping limit??? Id say limited servers.
2290,so fun!
2291,nice game
2292,It ends up being terrible.
2293,"Okay I know I don't have a lot of hours in so far but I really do think this is a good game so far. For a free FPS I am having a lot of fun with it.
I will try to come back and update this when I have played more but so far I am impressed. I could nit pick a few things but it is a free game and I suggest you give it a shot.

Quick update, 
It seems that in game stuff that you buy only last 24 hours, but you do make more in game currency as you play so not a big deal. 
A little annoying is all."
2294,This is a very fun game and I highly recommend it if you are on a budget.

As I've seen written in a some other reviews, on the technical side the game is pretty good and better than most other fps in its class. If you can get past the trolls and hackers you might just enjoy the game."

First of all, this game used be amazing, after so many changes it got terrible. 
I have over 1600 hours, on that game and my player name is IRonsides*Frenzy, and they banned without any proper explanation, even tho the market is closed. If you are looking for a new game, this game is not that game. 
Please not download the game even not spend 5 mins, it is totally waste of time. 

Thanks."

2322,"For Free2play, the game is really good. Donate in the game does not interfere with playing, this is not in every game you can see. The game strongly resembles CS:GO, so cs fans will love it. In general, I advise you to play, you will not regret it!"
2323,no
2324,Its what it is. An online fps. :)
2325,"Ded?

Very nice mechanics (weapons, patterns, movement = very aim based), but it slowly dies out. Sad but the devs ruined it."
2326,just play counter strike
2327,Quite nice if you don't want to go in competitive. but soo many toxic players
2328,"Was better, but now skins are worthless..."
2329,the UI is pretty confusing but i mean if you can get it to work then its fun
2330,Decent 6/10
2331,"Used to be a really good game, got sold to another company, they absolutely ruined the game and turned it into another P2W free game, dont listen to the steam reviews saying mostly positive because those are from when people used to play the game and the game was actually fun."
2332,OK
2333,Black Squad shagging your momma
2334,"I would only recommend this game if there are no other alternatives for you. If you have no money to buy a  shooter like Call of Duty or Battlefield, go play a free game like Valorant or something. This game isn't better than a mobile shooter game. It is only nice if you and your friends have potato computers and want to play a mutliplayer shooter together (that's why I have so many hours in this game). It was nice when I was 10 years old and had nothing better to play on my cheap pc, but not anymore. Overall not a very good game, but it can be ok if you play with some friends."
2335,"Actually idk how developers think about future of this game xD

In addition too i doesn`t contain mechanical movement like cs.."
2336,i play this only for the hitmarker sounds
2337,good
2338,Feels a bit like Tactical Ops
2339,"From a technical standpoint, it's above all other FPS games except for CS:GO. The hit registration is ON POINT. Accuracy is on point. Map design is symmetrical, kept it simple, and there are niches and sight lines that make you think ""Wow, I can't believe they thought of that."" 

What makes me like this game even MORE than CS:GO is the graphics, the optimization and the art. The little things like weapon balance and the emblems and sound effects when you get a kill/headshot. These are important little things that add to a game's personality and character. CS:GO completely separates itself from these little things that the franchise USED to have for some reason and now it's just as bland as modern day Razer products.

One EXTREMELY important thing in regards to online games and ESPECIALLY online competitive first-person shooter games is NET.WORK.ING. The current year, modern day, every single top FPS game has completely garbage netcode and networking. Absolute trash tier. This game? Nah. This game rises above it. You have 80 ping? You won't even notice. Your hit reg magically still works properly. 

Cons? Small game. Small community. Small company. The game has bugs, it will crash on you, it will give you some weird performance issues sometimes. The MTX is also egregious. Obviously it's not pay to win but, if you want skins..prepare to pay.

Basically? Play this god damn game, especially if you are North America so I have some more NA people to play with. Literally only EU/ASIA/AUS people play this game right now."

2345,Fun
2346,"yea
"
2347,"Matchmaking? I don't even want to talk about this... It's really really bad honestly.
Community? Just a bunch of deaf toxic dogs. They flame you for their own mistakes most of the time...
Prices? This dog[strike]shit[/strike]  game literally doesn't support Steam Market trading anymore and they charge like 100$ for 1 goddamn box where you can get time-limited skin or even worse, a spray LMAO

They seriously need to make some changes to the game... New player experience is horrible. I don't know what's up with the Competitive matchmaking as you need to play for 50 hours to get access to it."
2348,"Honestly the core gameplay is fine. It's very solid and skill based as it takes the better elements of Counter Strike and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and wraps it up in a pretty tight and mostly responsive package mechanically.(The way the game queues you up for matches makes Ping extremely inconsistent, so you should probably look out for that.)

The problems arise when it gets to the actual competition part of the game. With a community so small, there aren't really many players you'll bump into. In-fact you might run into the same people numerous times should you choose to play your favorite game mode over and over.  Which also means that if someone in your match was cheating, you'll likely be forced to play with them again whether you like it or not.

These things drag down an otherwise fine game. Even with Microtransactions, it never truly felt broken or unfair."

Revisited the game at 2021 to find that the devs removed all the permanant shop items and change it all into boxes.
They also removed bs coins reward from daily mission.
Game constantly crashing (maybe just for me idk).
Shitty game support.
Bad hitboxes.
Shitty anti-cheat system.
Basically the devs just milk the shit out of their game and don't really care about improving their game at all.

Pros:
I liked most of the guns

too similar to CS:GO

Every skin I bought or got isn't tradable or marktable

Now come improve on your trombone technique."" Needless to say that was my last year going to band camp."

2383,Csgo is free
2384,it is a fun game to play and you would really like it if your bored.
2385,"I have to say... an real good fps which is f2p and offers more than enough content. At first I was sceptic because I had bad experience with these kind of f2p games in the past, but Black Squad was really hell of fun for me. I can recommend it to everyone who liked playing games like counter strike and cod. And I don't say that it's perfect, but it's definetly a good game for playing casual."

Boxes are all significantly more expensive than CS:GO or TF2 and aren't clear what they can contain. 
Your character will shout ""TAC RELOAD"" >50% of the time when changing mags, even when reloading from empty (?!)
Most weapons hold 29+1, 39+1 etc
Are you just unable to fire the last round in your gun?

Grenades make a massive difference in a fight, but you have to *rent* them.

2495,"The game at the heart is a cod/csgo hybrid. That being said it misses it's step completely to set it's self apart from competition. You walk at a snail pace as there is no running. The map design is basic as it comes, typical 3 lane design. Skins are very bland, unoriginal, and require to be purchased with $. Character design is the most basic I have seen with 8 preset characters, no custom clothing loadouts. You have to purchase grenades every day, very few weapons in the game. The games population is always on the decline with 5 minute lobbys to find a match the majority of the time. Hackers are running rampant. The game is clearly a cash grab with no intentions of innovation. With all that being said the gun gameplay is decent, and can be self rewarding. 

Another kind of a big issue is the lack of players. The player base is slowly dying and only og's usually play this, new people arent coming and with this review less. 5/10"

I think that they shouldn't have done that. I have sold skins in this game worth at least 20 euro. And I got them pretty much for enjoying game and playing daily. At the end I still spent those money on this game, but sadly the drop sistem was or is broken, like you have pretty much 1 in 50 chanse to at least not lose money. Also there is a chanse that you could'v only get medals which is worthles. I really hope developers to bring skin marketing and maybie add some more variety of guns that you could get without spending money. Still I would recommend this game, it's great."

CSGO má problém že tam jsou cheateři ale v BLACK SQUAD sem nepotkal ani jednoho cheatera jo někteří jsou tak dobří že se zdají jako cheateři ale jsou dobří :-) 



                                              (můj názor :-) )"
2519,i love this game!
2520,good
2521,"After change to Valofe, thing are going badly !."
2522,"It's like if you took CS and CoD and made it into one game. It's fun for a bit, but there's nothing super original/interesting about this game. Still, it's free, give it a try =)"
2523,vote kanye
2524,"Try it for yourself, but it's not like other FPS where you may die 5 times, expect to die 20+ times when first playing :')"
2525,"great game, and nice way to take out frustration especially if you wanna do some shooting. I play this game with my boyfriend and friends id recommend this"
2526,"I wanna start of with saying i do recommend this game for anyone looking for a fun free to play game. although there are some problems with the game which may result in players not having a good time. Anyways why i am writing this message is to say that i do not appreciate the latency of getting your season end rewards even when the season has clearly already ended, and this has occured several times before in other seasons, while other games have no trouble with rewarding the player instantly with season end rewards. Im not glad to see that since many players have waited quite a while for the season to end and have worked hard to achive their rank no matter what it is, and getting nothing for a good while. i am currently speaking about [season 8]. 
P.S
Thank you for anyone that agrees with this issue that i have presented and thank you if YOU valofe read this and take this into consideration."
2527,"I don't know, cool game, but go play CS:GO."

2530,Overwatch is better
2531,No
2532,Cannot find matches easily. Have to wait on the lobby screen for more than 2 to 3 mins.
2533,"decent free to play game if you're lucky enough to get past the hacks,toxic chats,and bad rng for the lootboxes."
2534,"worst fucking shooter game ever played in my life don't recommend it at all, the mechanics are dog shit and i don;t even know who woke up and though that making the leader in arms race should be visible to everyone in the whole fucking map holy!, like this game is above shit, a newgrownds game is better than this"
2535,servers are dead i guess
2536,"Love this game!! Being improved all the time with new games and constantly updating seasonal skins. It takes a reasonable processor and graphics card but if you game a lot, you'll be all over that already.

2541,if u can't afford Call of duty here is your pick but with a lot of fuck tone of bugs and lots of glitches with shit tone of downsides  DON'T GET THIS ASS GAME
2542,I enjoyed playing this game
2543,Crashes every 10 minutes..
2544,"not even sure why this game has 70% positive reviews i can't think of anything this game has done right besides not be 100% pay to win like Warface where you need to pay real money to regenerate health and armor......

Guess i'll make a list 

[list]
    [*] 80% of Guns are AR's and over half of them are literally M4's all weapon types besides AR's are useless except Sniper Rifles on extremely long range maps ( Theirs like 3 ) and revolvers which are good if you run out of primary ammo. Machine guns and Smg's are 100% worthless
    [*] There are only 2 Server Regions which you can't choose so you will either have 40 ping or 140 ping depending which one you get 
    [*] Silencers! you want every gun in a game to make literally no sound just press F!
    [*] Hackers, love getting killed by wall hackers? why not try a game without anticheat!
    [*] Probably the worst hitboxs and backtracing i've seen wouldn't be so horrible if you didn't get an annoying ""Hit marker"" sound 14 times and die to see they still have full health...
    [*] Walking, I don't know who decided this was a good idea but walking like cs removes all footstep noises, HOWEVER, it only removes like 10-15% of your movement speed so while bother ""Running""  when everyone can be silent ALL game
    [*] Mouse sensitivity is different for EVERY Loadout and has to be changed INDIVIDUALLY with better yet a SLIDER NO NUMBER INPUT which wouldn't be so horrible if it didn't jump 5 numbers up just by clicking on it and then RANDOMLY CHANGES AFTER
    [*] Melee weapons just don't work
    [*] Arm's Race is the Worst gun game knock off that uses only 10 guns over 20-25 ""levels"" which don't even take a consistent amount of kills to level up and worst of all knifing players doesn't even reduce their level especially when melee is so bad and you require 2 KILLS TO WIN!
    [*] The game is absolutely ugly looking all the textures are so dated which is even more baffling why the game runs like such ass! game looks like minecraft but runs like cyberpunk
    [*] The most offensive problem is the fact that everytime you run around the corner the game takes around 1/10 of a second to render things in?? like why in a reaction shooter is there gonna be a delay
[/list]"
2545,Nicer vebugter Abklatsch von CS GO.
2546,I am a victim of brain rot.
2547,this is a best game
2548,A cheap Rip-off version of CS:GO honestly and boring as hell. CS:GO is free and a lot more fun with more players as a challenge compared to this dying game.

2567,THIS GAME IS VERY SAAD
2568,"Things that lead to Black Squad's decline:
• Closed steam market
• Removed perm shop items (now in boxes)
• Removed perm comp/playtime rewards
• Limited comp to solo play
• No new maps/weapons in the last few updates
• Removed bs coin rewards from daily missions
• All time low active player count
• Still seeing hackers from time to time
• Cross server play is horrible with the big ping differences (but is needed with such a small playerbase)
• Removed gold random box
• Legit players being banned
• Unreasonable game support (copy paste responses or ignored)
• Bad chat system (plagued the game since the beginning)
• Long time players have nothing good to spend their medals and gold on (there were a few boxes but the chance of a good item was way too low)
• Personal point: removed ability to do accurate no-scopes/jumpshots ;C

Having played the game for a long time it's sad to see it go down like this. The community is very vocal about the things they feel are wrong with the game, yet all these points are brushed aside. Even with the player base continuing to shrink, no positive changes are being made. Lost players are also unlikely to come back after having moved on."

this game was promising when it first launched with a lot of player base 20 second match found
nowadays...even in quick match takes me 10 minutes to join a game
the custom lobby all locked with password (jerk)
and the graphic looks like its from 2011

2599,"I was looking forward to a somewhat balanced free to play fps, this game is styled in the way CS is, and by that i mean no sprint or run function other than with your knife out. matchmaking isn't fair at all, which would be good if you could use base classes. however at lvl 1 i have a primary and a side arm, no grenades and no utility.

that wasn't really the problem, the problem i had was blatantly getting the jump on someone unloading 7 rounds into the back of their head, as well as a teammate shooting them. they kill both of us and another straight after and was only at half hp... did i mention i unloaded 7-8 rounds into the person prior to them even beginning to shoot.

it appears that this game once was pretty good but since the acquisition from the other company they make everything un-obtainable unless you spend mega money, there's about 8 currencies, 2 of which are farm-able, which you can buy crates which give you ""basic"" weapons on 3 day trail limits.

certain guns are clearly over powered, like one shot from across the map where as others youd need 2 clips to even do damage."
2600,good game
2601,Bruh this is a free csgo to make it simple
2602,"Hey :D
First to address the obvious: This game is VERY similar to CSGO.
Gameplay is great, no pay to win, the community is mostly nice and there are no completely unbalanced weapons or maps.
The usual gambling mechanic of lootcrates, with impossible odds to get anything visually appealing, untradeable and mostly unmarketable items and Devs giving away free skins to streamers they like are the only real problems i see with this game.
7/10 because its free."

2624,"very nice game

ruined very beautiful game this game when it comes out was very good game then devolopers ruined the game and foucs on crates and skins to take everything in ur pocket instead of enhance and update noodels Anti cheat system they got."

2632,"The gun-play is very stiff and there is no sprint option other than aim-walking. The game would have been implemented better if the aim option was removed for a zoom option and sprint function utilized.
Overall this is a fun shooter: the consequences are not viably demeaning for dying - it's just good fun.
I have been in a few lobbies with hackers but they are far and few between."

wow"
2641,"Black Squad is a game in which you will experience a lot of emotions. You will be happy that you completed an objective, you will wonder how the other person you were in a gun battle lived, and you will stand in amazement as somebody managed to shoot you through a wall. 

How does all of this happen? Well there area  lot of various hackers on BS that you will run into on most of your servers. It got to the point where there was a reoccurring message in my inbox offering me ""undetectable hacks.""  Yesterday a player got booted from a server via the Battleye anti-cheat system and today he was on another server that I was on.

When you go against honest players, you will find that they may no every spot and every design flaw in every map of BS. You will find that a lot of players also paid for the guns they have and their guns are better than yours. 

Finally you will find that there are regularly enemy players who do nothing all game but camp your spawn points. This is particularly bad in destruction when you have players who will just call in bombers again and again as they kill the spawning team."

i think the problem in this game that it is kinda pay to win , u don't need to pay for powerful weapons but at the first maybe u won't have really good weapons so it take a while to get good weapons that if they didn't expir . But it is a free game so u won't lose anything if u try it and . i hope u will have fun with it"
2650,goof fps game for now
2651,"Honestly, not fun! don't waste your valuable internet downloading this game, its pay to win!  u pay, u get better guns. You will most likely not win a fight against someone who has paid"
2652,Not Bad.
2653,What the fuck is this game it must be so bad I don't even remember playing it.
2654,..
2655,"This game was dead long before Valofe owned BS. I cannot even recommend this game for a newbie, or returnee. No more permanent weapon; if you know Point Blank(Piercing Blow, which was at steam long time ago, before it was shut down), BS used this system. Medal-based weapon now reduced as hell: If I remember correctly, there was about 20+ weapon which can be bought via medal, now its no more. However, if you bought the permanent weapon before valofe own BS, rejoice, you can keep it until this game dead.

This game should be designed to be great, LONG before BS entered steam greenlight. Balanced gameplay, weapon can be bought permanently with both in-game point or real money.

IDK when BS will commence to their end, but i dont believe what valofe said about improvement.

Valofe, good luck taking care this dead game.
NSStudio,  you're not listening player's suggestion. You reap what you sow."
2656,I witnessed lots and lots of hackers being booted and I assume there are heaps more who dont get detected in this game .......................it'd be nice to find a game without scriptwriters
2657,i in love with this game
2658,Fun game. (Pay 2 win a little?)
2659,It Ight
2660,valofe took a game that desperately needed help and just completely ruined it. don't bother
2661,"good game,Lil bit P2W but ok."
2662,Was a good game as a replacement for those that didn't want to pay for games like CSGO before it became free had a decent player-base and good future. UNTIL VALOFE came in and screwed it. I played for the first time in awhile recently only to find my permanent skins gone and the currency meaningless. I really enjoyed the actual game play but you may as well play CSGO now. :(
2663,"This game sucks, p2w."
2664,very good high quality game for the price (free)
2665,Hard game somehow
2666,I REALLY ENJOY THE FAST PACE GAMEPLAY THIS GAME INVOLVES ALONG WITH THE SHORTER OR LONGER MATCHES AND SMALL MAPS MAKES THIS GAME A WONDERFUL FIRST PERSON SHOOTER TO HAVE FUN AND PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS
2667,1
2668,Guns aren't realistic making it fun until you want a new gun costing you a shit ton of effort or a few dollars.
2669,this game is so bad hAHAHAHAHAHAHA
2670,"i liked it
"
2671,"Pay to win. I have nothing else to say. Not like a standard pay to win. But EXTREME pay to win. You have to pay for guns daily amount, if you won't they will dissapear, so others usually have advantage - those who buy permanent guns for money"
2672,gud
2673,gud.
2674,"real basic shooter. kind of playable if thats what youre after, but with minimum enormous ping from AUS it's not really viable."
2675,Good. Said by Begozz.
2676,nice game
2677,"Valofe very bad game developer, they destroyed this game, no more voice in competitive mod and a lot of guns are gone."
2678,"Please go somewhere else, this game is now on a countdown to its death.

This was a decent light game to complement playing Battlefield or CoD for me, and I own a huge list of FPS games that I rotate around. Hop on for some quick matches, hop off anytime when you gotta go somewhere. For a long time, it was fun. 

However, recently it's really gone down the drain as you can't buy guns permanently with in-game currency, and a massive list of weapons got nuked from the store. Seriously not sure what these guys are thinking. They also seemed to have closed trading in the marketplace. All of this is an attempt to further enable loot box gambling and milking a loyal player base.

I DO NOT, and WILL NOT recommend this game to any new players, there are better games out there for insanely cheap prices, and you should not support publishers actively murdering their own game."
2679,this game is good
2680,Good game but need better updates
2681,love it
2682,Very gud game.
2683,"i loved to play it with my friends, was playing competetive a whole lot, but they patched it so u cant queue with your friends anymore(just groups of 1 allowed). in my eyes worst thing u can do. game is dead due to this single patch.
Absolute NO Pay2Win (u can get any guns with gold/Medals). Since Valofe bought this game, this game went straight up downhill. Aslong they dont change something about competetive this game will be a big No No

UPDATE: After the massive backslash they got from the community they finally made it possible to play Solo/Duo in Ranked again! this is why i change my opinion from thumbs down to thumbs up!"

2691,Good game but this game have soo much hackers
2692,"Best First Person Shooter  In my opinion
You can waste like hours on tdm and not playing plant single time
So you are kinda bad? No everyone have own style of play
Plant is more like teamplay so idk. 
Game is faster than CS:GO in my opinion better.
Less hacker waves you need better aim still.
Anyway, game is fun you should try it
Hope you enjoyed 
Cya :)"
2693,its a mobile fps game on pc
2694,Valofe ruined it completely. was still fine for a while but uninstalled immediately when they disabled squad matchmaking.
2695,GG ^.^
2696,"oh, another copy of csgo ,fail as allways.
dont install it , waste of time."
2697,good game
2698,"NOTE: I have played this game for substantially more time than my steam account would indicate as I had other steam accounts.

VALOFE became the publisher for the game and subsequently released an update which removed permanent guns from the regular store and substantially reduced the number of guns available in the medal store (only currencies you can in-earn game). I know there were other aspects of the game affected negatively but this decision to attempt to force people to purchase bullet currency (only purchasable with real money) to buy permanent guns and lootcrates (that don't even have permanent guns in them). This update will lead to this game's demise worse than Covid-19, incompetence."
2699,"Can't say that the game is good ,but at least it isn't very bad :)"
2700,Developers should just develop Black Squad 2
2701,e
2702,white screen. am i allow? great game last year.
2703,Valofe came and kicked the existing players to the balls and made unnecessary and awful changes to the game. I've played almost 600 hours of this game and I don't think I'll be playing a lot more (unless they make changes to make the game good again).
2704,"Well anti cheat on this game doesnt work full of hackers!!
"
2705,old game but run very slow than newer game with more feature and better graphic
2706,its csgo but better
2707,"Game was fun for the first few hours, until you got good and starting to realized the abnormalities, for example, 
-Sneak behind a sniper rifle holding enemy and they instantly do a 90 degree turn and switch into a pistol and gun you down in 1 shot in less then 1 second.
-Hiding in a corner impossible to be spotted but enemy knowing you are there before they even see you.
-Spray a full clip into someone and they magically survived and are twice as durable then normal players, like they have extra health or something, miracles!

By all the above mentioned examples i'm sure aliens are among us and playing this game."
2708,"I used to play this game 2018 when this was only NS studios then it was a fun game ,but in 2019-2020 the game started to die it took almost 5 mins just to find a TDM . I have heard it has a new developers hope the servers too come alive."
2709,haha poopy
2710,"It's an alright first person shooter, The only downside if you are interested in investing in skins and items, There is not an option to sell or trade any items sadly. I wish I knew this before I brought a bundle of items, It is a great game otherwise though, I would recommend it.

2720,"I heard of this game by simply coming across it in a youtube video. I then started watching other people play this game and realised that ""woah, this game seems fun as hell!"". At first, it was really fun, but at some point after the first anniversary, everything about the game and companies working on it seemed to get exponentially worse every update/hotfix.

Some of the most notable things that are bad with this game and everything related to it are the terrible customer service/support team, VALOFE making all skins and items unmarketable, meaning that your only way to acquire skins or cosmetics was by buying their cases or their in-game currencies (which doesn't seem too bad, but their only ""good"" skins are incredibly expensive when you acquire them with things such as BS coin or bullets). The lack of skilled-based matchmaking has also killed this game, since it's incredibly hard to get used to it's unique gunplay since training with the bots is stupidly hard. The bots' AI is nearly impossible to get used to- It requires amazing reflexes to overcome them from my personal experience since they seem incredibly stupid until their AI notices you. If they notice you, you're dead; they literally have aimbot, which IS the main reason why most think bots are useless, due to almost every single gun can 1-shot to the head. Briefly, to get good at the game, you have to already be good at other shooter games, which I do not see why you'd use as a way to train for Black Squad, since chances are that the ""training game"" you're playing is much better than Black Squad.

I'd give the devs my recommendations to make the game better, but knowing that they never listen to community would render that useless, so I won't bother and waste my time.

Please don't install this game, it's only a waste of your time."
2721,fun
2722,NOOOOOO ONE IN THE GAME
2723,gun do go bang but enemy go bang bang
2724,Bad but It seems i can't stay away from her

2726,CSGO is better
2727,"you need to try is so fun !
"
2728,"welp lets start with the matchmaking: you are level one right? ok then lets put you with someone level 42069 unlocked all guns and know every peeking point on the map 

gameplay: dogshit

pay to win?: yes it is pay to win game 

graphics: no matter how high you put them they still look like ass< shit my lil brother would do better

servers: unstable as every high schooler relationship a second im 11 ping another second im frozen and unable to even look around

optimization: lmao you thought!!

overall dogshit game ,if you are broke just save money and but cod

2729,Retired from Black Squad see you again
2730,"i never played this, looks kinda cool tho

yoooo where da steam points at

steam points is for me?
  😥
👉👈"
2731,"After, 1k hours in one account only, I can tell you to stay away, as Severus Snape stays away from shampoo.

There is no incentive to play this game. The ""comp mode"" is dead, as the previous permanent weapons rewards were completely removed - to maintain game balance, according to Valofe, somehow.(?) Also, before Valofe took over, you were able to play with a squad and also solo. Now... not even a squad is allowed :) This is the only mode where you can use Vivox (Voice-in). So, be ready to use the mute option when 4 randoms start shouting at you for no reason whatsoever.

The Custom Server allows you to create a room for your region.... while allowing everybody for everywhere else to enter, which eventually means that you can create a ""EU Room"", for example, and have it flooded by players with 200+ Ping that speak as much english as a korean toddler, and the ocasional european ping. This is only countered by locking your room with a 4 digit password. So, unless you have a full group of 8(!) friends, at least, to lock yourself with in a room, your gaming experience will be largely affected by someone else's ping. 

Finally, Quick Match does it well, as it matches you with people. What criteria is used for that marvelous matchmaking, you ask? None. Your rank(Level), KAD, Region are irrelevant. So, good luck! Sitting through a full 5v5 vs what can be a range of possibilities - a full 5 players' squad with 200+ ping from the same clan, or 5 randoms with 5 different pings and one or two is still figuring out how to shoot or plant... is painful. If you actually sit through it, a possible 15 round match... You deserve a medal.

ALSO, as a last minute note: This is the only FPS game that I've played that actually prevents you from chatting with your teammates, when you die. As soon as you die, you cannot give any directions or info or anything. The only people that can read what you say are... the other dead players. Genius."

The previous developer was much better than this valofe.
They blocked my account for no reason. And when I asked for support and asked why my account was blocked, I sent a text but they did not pay attention to it. Anyway, Black Squad developers do not care what you say, they just know how to ban our accounts. (Many old players are banned like me :) 
game is really good at all.
its good game with stupid and moron developers who want make money fast with closed steam market.
at last when i banned i say it to steam support but they could not do anything and said me you should contact support to valofe (but they do not care about players :)

2753,Well Good F2p shooter game its fun to play

2755,"Game used to be a really solid game. VALOFE fucked it up severely.
Now instead of being able to buy a basic gun permanently, you are only able to effectively ""rent"" it for 1-30 days for the exact (or higher) price that you used to be able to buy it permanently for.
The only way to get any gun permanently anymore is through loot crates, which you cannot even open with the free currency.

Basically this game is completely shut off to anyone who has not been playing prior to these updates.

Do not support these piece of shit developers."

2775,"Good FPS game as any means. Minor bugs alone my 150+ hours game play. You can consider it as a casual relaxing game, or if you want to be serious, both work.
Only bad thing,,,,is that the weapons are not 'free' anymore I mean the most famous weapons which everyone want to try, such as AK47 and M4A1. You can easily get them when I started to play a few years ago. Now I picked the game back I noticed you have to spend quite some time on purchasing those guns or, of course, pay some money as a shortcut.
Overall, nice game which still has lots players and the Unreal engine provides an 'OK' graphic scenes as an online game."

2807,AN EXCELLENT BASIC SHOOTER GAME FOR BEGINNERS THAT WANT TO PRACTICE WITH KEYBOARD AND MOUSE ( THAT WILL BE ME )
2808,"My patience is wearing thin. Valofe is going to ruin this game. NS Studio wasnt listening on community and they where bad developers since about 2 years, but Valofe is going to be crazy. 
Steam Market closed (was closed short before takeover, they didnt open it again), ingame Market horrible, they raised the prices beyond good and evil for items nobody care about and chances to get them beneith criticism.
they removed sprays and cards etc for whatever reason. events are copied from years above but rewards are devalued as hell.
im really patience and im sure everyone should get a second bite at the cherry, but every update, things  getting worse.^

the key scene: a clan or friends cannot play together anymore!! you arent able to play with 5 together in competitive anymore, you stuck in quick match demolition waiting and never get a game (guys are moaning in global ingame chat too), cannot abort, you have to close the game via task manager to get out of this loop... clan matches are hard to get, there are mb 2 in queue if you are lucky. someone is spamming ddos attack in chat and (EU) servers arent playable. in team deathmatch there are strange things ongoing, players lagging more and more.

i rare write negative reviews, VALOFE help to reversal my/our opinion and dont buy games to let them die!

Black Squad was the funniest game and the best alternative fps after other ones like we all played together till the end.

Conclusion: never was and still is neither p2p nor p2w, but actually l2p (luck 2 play^^) and p2m4fb (pay too much for fancy bullshit)?!!!!!!

after over 1900 hours of gameplay: R.I.P BS, VALOFE DELIVER!!!!
i would really appreciate it if you convince us of the contrary!

update 22.07.2021: 
update include battlepass, attendancepass .. ... .. instead of bugfixes...

2815,"This is a fantastic game for if you want to have a bit of fun. It isn`t very strategic, its mainly just shoot whoever may be around the next corner. I wouldn`t recomend it to anyone without a graphics card if you intend to play in public lobbies, you`ll just get frustrated, as the public lobbies can be quite hard without a lot of practice. But overall, a great game."
2816,this game is f****** s***. it is rife with cheaters and there is nothing being done about it. i like the mechanics of the game but cheaters ruin it.
2817,"fure

2818,"CS:GO Ripoff :] 

Plus : A lot of cheaters"
2819,"New punlisher VALOFE Bought the game... nuff said really but I shall continue anyway...

Imagine having lost all monetary value on skins that used to be marketable because VALOFE does not want players trading skins.
Imagine Paying for in game currency (Bullet) to then open loot crates for only a chance to get a decent looking skin.... and even if you get it you'll only have it for a limited time because permanent skins are so rare now.
Imagine spending hours of your time playing grinding BS coins to try to get some decent skins, only for VALOFE to come along and make you pay for a chance to get BS coins.

This feels Like a repeat of AVA where another company buys the game and just straight up ruins it and shows the middle finger to loyal players"
2820,it is a pretty fun game
2821,"This is a difficult game for me to give a negative review to, especially since I've gotten so many hours of enjoyment out of it. It's a fun, free game with decent gameplay, enjoyable maps, and good graphics. However, there are several glaring problems with the store system that are now at the point where I can no longer recommend this game.

The single biggest problem I had during all my hours with the game is how grenades worked (not in-game, but rather pre-game). In other games, they will usually give you a base lethal and tactical grenade, then you either progress in-game to unlock new ones or buy them with in-game currency. In this game, you [i]rent[/i] your grenades. As in you repeatedly have to pay in-game currency so you can temporarily have access to a core part of FPS gameplay. This means that, before you can even play the game, you have to go to the store and buy the same two items on every session. The maximum rent period is 30 days, but chances are you will play this game more intermittently, so you'll probably only rent it between 1 and 3 days at a time. On the surface, this doesn't sound like a huge problem, but it really sucks when you forget to buy grenades [i]again[/i] and end up in a match without a vital part of your toolkit. The only way to permanently unlock a grenade is to get one in a loot box. So unless you spend an obscene amount of real-world money and get extremely lucky, grenades are a constant in-game currency drain.

And they just applied this system to guns as well.

So now, not only can grenades expire, guns can to. This means you can get into a match only to realize the guns in all three of your loadouts expired, all of your grenades are gone, and you are stuck with a knife (and potentially secondary weapon, I didn't test it) as your only weapon in a first-person shooter. I'm willing to give a little when talking about a free game, but there's a line in the sand and Black Squad has crossed that. You should not have to repeatedly rent the same items on every login just to be able to play the game. You should have access to guns/grenades once you buy them. No first person shooter should throw you into a fight without any actual weapons at all. This is the bare minimum of an FPS game, yet Black Squad fails to deliver on these core aspects of gameplay.

I genuinely enjoy the gameplay when I have all my tools. I genuinely enjoy the maps. But this new implementation of weapons in the store is absolutely inexcusable. The grenade system was ridiculous, but this is too far. I hope they change it, I really do. But I cannot in good conscience recommend Black Squad with the game in the state that it is."
2822,WE
2823,The fastest uninstall I will probably ever do. Server lag is insane and it just seemed thrown together.
2824,"Do not tried to get items from the boxes in this game because the chances of getting anything good is really really LOW! I spent 100 dollars on event boxes because that is the only way you can get a character for unlimited time, but the truth is I didn't get anything more than 3 days of use."
2825, BAD
2826,"Good game, not many salty people or hackers"
2827,Good game.
2828,is so good go play

2830,best free game ever
2831,"its a good gam no pay to win
but its take too long for matchmaking quick match"
2832,sorta dead
2833,"I do not recommend this game for multiple reasons. 
1 - You start with one Primary weapon. (that you can't chose) and one Pistol (again you can't chose)
2 - Changing your settings is quite complicated.. Especially mouse sensitivity. (You need to setup your sens for each class.) WTF IS THAT!
3 - When you are in queue. You can't access anything while you wait you need to stare in the abyss and wait. 
4 - The maps are designed to favor campers. (I think this lowers the skill level this game will achieve)
5 - You need to unlock guns with in-game money. (I would rather pay for skins with in-game money)
Example. for 1million of the games currency you get a bad ass skin.  This will make it achievable for loyal players and easy to get if you take out your wallet. Its not pay to win and you get your micro transaction.
6 - The interface has way to much going on. You have updates and messages everywhere you look.
7 - Why do you need 5 currencies? Its just too much 3 to me would be a win-win.
** Currency # 1 In-game money. Currency # 2 Real money (skins) Currency # 3 Event or season.
8 - After 2 hrs I wanted to join a Comp match. Little did I know I need to play even more because its rank locked. Why not having an elo ranking system that will let new players get a taste of comp? 
9 - I think there should be a auto-knife button (like call of duty) Or If you run it switches to your knife.

I could keep going but now, I would like to get to things I like.
 
1 - The sounds are cool. 
2 - I like the different smoke. 
3 - Gun mechanics are nice. 
4 - Graphics are nice the game runs smooth."
2834,This is a great game and is totally free. It's very similar to Call of Duty. One of my go to games when I need fast action.

2849,"I feel really bad about doing this, but the game is terrible. Nothing about it is special in any way, and the gameplay and graphics play like a 2008 mobile game. Controls are clunky, gunplay is extremely disappointing, and kills don't feel satisfying at all. It's like someone took COD; made a crappy ripoff of the narrative, and reduced the graphics to run on grandma's computer. It really pains me to leave negative reviews, but this game is actual garbage. I uninstalled right after the tutorial; mostly because multiplayer didn't connect either. Wasn't worth the disk space, or my time."
2850,Yes
2851,UUMM ng
2852,.
2853,"To be fair, im rather conflicted with this game, this game is nor good or bad.
This game is certainly a csgo clone however it does bring its own charm to the table like the inclusion of grenade launchers with certain weapons and the fact that you don't need to buy your weapons every round.

However, these are all the positives i can think of when it comes to this game. Unfortunately, just like with most free to play shooters, it highly encourages pay to win which im highly against so unfortunately I'll have to give it a ""not recommended"" even though i believe this game isn't bad, its just the fact that the game has nothing going for, sadly."
2854,"After 500 hours of game play I decided  to uninstall. The biggest problem is team balance. You either play in team full of noobs and you loose because it is impossible to shoot 4 players at once from every direction. Or you play with good players and win very easy (KD 50/10). And neither of this is fun. Good game is very rare.
Plus competitive tiers doesn't reflect skills of players. You easily meet no skill Lion player and on the other side no rank can play like little god. Of course also luck plays the role here. So competitive is not much about personal skills, much more it is about players in your team. An BS fails to split players fairly. 
Another issue is with no regs. You shoot enemy directly in head, wall behind is full of blood, but his life remains at 100%. This happens quite often.
Another thing is that waiting times for match is long - about 60 - 80 sec in average. 
If you want to avoid rage, dont play.

2. I recently started playing this and have brought a lot of players here, but as of new season none of them want to play. Please fix this honestly you took the game over only to make it die faster?

3. We don't mind the solo competitive and its a nice addition but the people with 200+-300 pings cant enjoy this game and unfortunately most of your player base will leave, fix this

One thing that is missing is the competitive atmopshere; maps need to have names for certain spots in the map, also in my opinion when you run your accuracy should be really bad. I see people running & gunning and managing to kill me like nothing. But overall the game is great."
2913,why my black squad item cant sale on steam market ?
2914,killed the game in latest update anyone looking to get the game dont its not worth the time untill they fix it
2915,"I forgot how it looked

2918,"The prices for bullets are shocking the old Devs had 500 bullets for 1 pound as a sale but the new Devs have a sale 500 bullets for 4 pounds(it's original price in 5 pounds)  I'll recommend if they fix up and stop being greedy

I'm shortening my Overall review if you want to read it ill leave it below if your not bothered this is shortened. Overall valofe produced 2 new gamemodes and sick skins but they ruined comp my making it duos and ranked rewards are temporary when you reach a high rank but they give comp points which you can buy permanent skins with. It makes no sense. they made a currency which was free payed and they made all skins payed only the crap ones are lef (the currency which they made payed is bs coins and they were used to but sick skins which were free andeant you could have good skins without spending a penny)  it will waste your time and money if you want to play with good.skins then this game is not For you. 

Valofe if you're reading this I'll be down to change my review on this game but until you return competitive to its previous form then the review will stay as it is. It's sad that I played this game for a very long time and I wanted to get comp rewards from it since season 5 it's season 9 and I got a rank where it gives you a skin that is temporary and not only that I almost lost a friendship in comp


the game is quite nice since there are custom modes but the new developers ruined the game. Firstly, you Can only play competitive with 1 friend and they took most of the free nice skins off the market which is really frustrating as I was saving up bs coins and now that they removed the weapon I feel like I have no goal in this game and the skins that are there ar just skins for guns rarely people use.

However the new developers actually listen to the reviews but they also are so greedy. The sales are a waste of money. The previous developers of black squad had deals twice as good.

Don't get me wrong here it's still a really fun game but if you want to play with amazing skins you would have to pay a lot of money to get them."
2919,rly poop
2920,stupid fkin game always got dc after and before game or sometimes while loading to match. sucks unlike it used to be

2923,"I think its one of the best free to play fps games. Good graphics and gameplay. You understand the game fast.
There are different modes to play like deathmatch or bombscenario like in other games like csgo for example. You can of course play with your friends. Overall its great fun and a great game. If you have already some experience with fps games and teams you can also climb ranks the competitive mode quite fast because the playerbase isnt as big and skilled like in other fps games."
2924,Keep crash at loading screen after found match. Fking Stupid sh*t!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

3028,decent absoloutely gotta try out
3029,It was a decent game but the devs made it worse over time. It had the potential to be a small but good esport title but every esport organisation left because of the developer team. They dont know what a good fps game requires and after the game is increasingly dying they just want to milk money out of the few remaining players. Sad story but they literally did things wrong normal people couldnt even imagine.

3148,"This game is utter trash. I played it back in 2017-2018 and it was never this bad I think. First of all, I launched the game and the game only gave me a glock, no primary, I had some money from my previous playthrough but it wasn't enough, I had around 50k and the least expensive primary was 96k. Second of all, everyone in the game spam explosives, kill people at spawn with explosives, camp, guns insta kill when my glock does nothing and I end up at the bottom of the leaderboard every match. Fuck this game. Don't play it unless you want to throw your wallet at it. The maps look like a kid just got started making maps, and not only that the map designs fucking SUCK. Guns are too fucking expensive especially since THE GAME DIDN'T GIVE ME A PRIMARY AND I'M STUCK WITH A SHITTY GLOCK."

3151,Game ini sangat bagus
3152,This game has so many hackers and you can't even ban them which is what sucks.
3153,"This game is as if you asked a team of decently competent yet unexceptional developers to recreate CS:GO based only on a verbal description. 

It's a fun, albeit a bit janky experience. If you are looking for a decent and mostly familiar free FPS, this is a good one. It won't blow your mind or anything, but it's enjoyable, easy to pick up yet with a lot of things to learn and the selection of weapons is nice. Also you can get most guns without coughing up cash, unless you really care about cool skins obviously. 

Give it a shot, it's a good past time. Ranked is cancer as usual though."

3188,"Back when I tried this game a while ago I thought that the optimization needed a overhaul (Framerate locked at 60fps and no culling) With a few tweaks this could be fun to play. other than that I can't recomend it, Will I come back to it? Maybe."
3189,"The game played great in 2017-2018, but with so many worthless patches, the game is a laggy POS if you have good ping. When players enter or leave the room (while in game), the screen will freeze for a millisecond, and bullets will not register. The big problem for me is with each update they remove a 32 player game mode like Destruction, Airborne, or 10 vs 10 capture. These game modes use a kind of kill streak class system where you earn points by going for an objective, and can use different class abilities with objective points you've earned. They leave all the cookie-cutter game modes that every shooter has like, Demolition 2 vs 2, Demolition 5 vs 5, TDM 8 vs 8, but never keep the fun class based game modes. You end up having to deal with the fact that each update they are gonna remove a game mode that you've come to enjoy, and replace it with something else. Just recently, they removed 32 player Destruction and replaced it with a really weak 8 vs 8 TDM called Arms Race. Your gun randomly changes to another gun with almost every kill you get. I played a match, and did well until the weapon changed to a sniper rifle, and that's about when I uninstalled the game. It USED to be a fun game with plenty of North American players, but with each update loses more of it's playerbase while the lag issues still persist since anyone with a dial-up connection can play the game with 900ms ping. They don't enforce any kind of ping limit, and it just becomes a mess. Shame too, because the game has a ton of potential, and used to run smooth, but consistently gets worse with each update. If it were 2017 or 2018 at the time of this review, I would recommend it, but now...."

This game have good 3D sound but thats it.
Mouse input is weird af. (Playing on EGG xm1 RGB)
Scope input scales WEIRD with your actual sensitivity.
Gameplay is clumpy and not fineshed.
Weapon recoil is trash on alsmost all weapons.
Game interface looks heavily like a free2play interface. Annoying pop ups and confusing af.
You can run this game only in 60Hz? 2021 XD

3293,"the retarded recoil patterns that almost all the ARs have, makes every player spray and pray. zero skill involved. 
¿why should you ADS if you can shoot from the hip like a caffeinated spastic monkey?.

You can't control or fight the recoil during full auto, the ARs will follow a retarded pattern similar to an impact sprinkler. So, if you want to aim and tap and control your recoil, you will receive a hail mary of bullets from an enemy that was barely aiming in your general direction.

Also headshots are instakill regardless of distance and damage of the weapon. you might survive a headshot but is quite rare, and most of the times you will spend more time respawning than actually getting in the fight, combine this with our friend the spastic monkey shooting like crazy, and you will get a really pleasant gaming session.

3299,very fun game to play with all ur friends. its free so anyone can get it thats the best part1
3300,..
3301,really cool game :) hope we will get some  new maps...
3302,"EVERRYHTING GET TO KILL EACH OTHER LOL
"
3303,"I love this game for it breathes a new air for Competitive FPS... 
However, the lack of developer/administrator support is quite discouraging. 
The mere fact that I spent 1,333hrs on this game (excluding playing on other accounts) and had played this for 3 years+ makes me qualified to rant on this game. 

1. Cheating Problems 
- They added a report button that has no function... They do not review any of the reported cases and cheaters are still around even after many Seasons have passed. Some even are still around and never been banned.
- THE RANKING SYSTEM HAS NO VALUE. You see a Dragon (Highest Rank) you immediately question if its a cheater or not. Cobra (2nd Highest Rank) is completely devoid since you are going to face someone cheating 9 times out of 10. 
- The button only works when in game. So if you are in lobby, or in loading screen before a compe match you cannot report a cheater and you're forced to dodge the game. (Doesnt matter bc it doesnt work) 
- Only available alternative to report is to have contact with any dev/admin and have them manual ban? Idk how that works but that's what other veteran players have been telling us. 

2. Servers and Game Crashes 
- The servers in this game are terrible. every gaming session or grinding session will have you or anyone from your team experience a game crash or Ping Spike. 
- Game Crashes are the most common and apparently the devs have no plan of fixing it since it has been around forever. Idk if it's the game files or the server itself but anyone even with the best PC configuration will still suffer the rampant Game Crashing issue.
- EU Players can play in Asia and gain peeker's advantage due to delayed inputs. Asians can also go to EU servers vice versa. 


3. Game Development 
- The game has been around for 7 years when it first released in South Korea... But we've never really seen any improvements in the game. 
It still uses DirectX9 and the entire game has not been improved ever since. If the game transitions to a new direction probably would revive it. (It's dying or dead by the time you read this) 
- No new maps... only skins skins skins skins skins skins skins... The map designs are horrendous... and some are just CSGO rip-offs. 
- Older weapons are nullified or lost its value when newer weapons are made such as the AK74m that has good recoil control, fast firing rate, and good damage with 3 shots kill - completely eradicating the AK12 and AK47 meta. 
- Everything feels so repetitive with no new game modes. Competitive is Dead due to cheating and lack of players. 
- The number of Active Players has not improved over the past years. Competitive match making will get you 1000+ seconds to be queued. The competitive matches are unbalanced (1250 ave. pts from one team vs over 2000mmr enemy) due to lack of players in the game. 

Conclusion: 
Not until the devs do something about the issues that are killing this game or if they do not introduce changes to it... I will never recommend this game. 
I love this game and I still play it to pass time... but maybe sooner or later I will completely leave."

3314,"This game reminds me a lot of A.V.A or Combat Arms if you already played one of those titles. I don't think we can qualified this game as a P2W, there are microtransactions, but in 10h i had no problem being top3 in few games and get the weapon i wanted in the shop, i don't know how many players there are (average or peak), but you'll easily find games, great game to kill time !"

3348,wrongly ban

3350,"The game's New Black Friday activity box is almost a fraud. I spent 70 dollars to open dozens of boxes, but I didn't get the props I wanted. In addition to the props I wanted, the rest were all useless activity game coins. I felt that I had been cheated. I played a lot of Online free games. I could buy all the props I wanted It's the only game that I've paid for, and I feel cheated that $70 can buy a great new release game, but you can't buy anything in this game, and I won't play this disappointing game again"

3357,"1) Assault rifles need renamed to Assault Snipers because they have 40 round magazines and 1 tap you. Imagine your entire team of 8 dying in 1 millisecond because 2 dudes both shot 10 bullets and then spawn camp you without even reloading THEN the other 6 dudes join in.

2) Hackers

3) Rarest skins god have ever even imagined that get released as micro transactions in the form of a crate system. You  can spend $100 and still not even get the skin. Literally there was an event that lasted 3 months and the knife doesnt even exist because nobody got it. Imagine wasting time making a skin that never gets put into the game LUL

4) They make icy and fire footsteps and cool ass shit like that and don't even allow players to buy em, you just randomly get it and it lasts 3 days and its gone forever. Wanna make money? Literally charge people for that instead of charging $2 for a crate that gives you nothing.

5) Hackers

6) Only 3 actually good guns in the game so nobody uses anything else. They're good because they have no recoil and they're assault snipers that 1 tap you. You can have the best aim ever and it doesn't matter because you'll come around the corner and die literally instantly over and over and over just trying to leave spawn.

7) Nobody p[lays any game mode whatsover besides 8v8 deathmatch so if you try to join any other lobby, youll come back from a vacation in Mexico a week later and you'll still be searching for a match.

8) I tap Assault Snipers"

3419,CS clone...
3420,awesome game
3421,Game seems like it is dying. Only a few old players (few new) are playing. When you switch lobbies you still end up in the same lobbies (no matter if it say different numbers) with the same players most times. Used to have 11k players its down to 2k players a month. If the server you are on has a high ping forget about your k/d you will lose to them at all times. Full of hackers at least 2 get ban every 5 lobbies i am in most play 2 or 3 games before they get ban. Only 3 slots for guns so choose your best ones and thats it without switching each time.
3422,Get into the game menu before a match and just moving the mouse cursor around causes the game to stutter. Fix your game.

Before you think it was my end,
No, I did not launch the wrong bit version
No, it's not just me. Had a friend try to, because we were gonna play with eachother. His also blue screened

Was really excited, sadly the game is broken. If this is a common issue please, let me know how to fix it. I'll hold off on uninstalling, if not, yeah this game was a waste of bandwith."

3468,"As you can see I have played this game A LOT. It's my most played game on Steam in fact. It's a nice game, however, the devs haven't been updating the game. No new maps, just reskins of guns and they are occasionally given to us from time to time. BS coins skins are like 80K and they are so expensive.

However, I am biased, as I have countless hours playing this game with my friends and this game does bring nostalgia to me. I urge the admins to start adding new content to the game as YOU ARE LOSING PLAYERS!!!

Thank you for your time : )"
3469,"I loved this game when I first started playing it in 2017. I had a very budget build so, my options were limited. 3 years later, after hours of validating, moving folders, messing with the config, and every other odd suggestion by the community: the game just doesn't work. It won't even boot to the game launcher. Give it a try. It may launch for you. Maybe some config changes will work for you, or maybe your system is old enough to run it. In which case; enjoy this great F2P shooter. Anyone on a modern system, I'd say find something else."

3490,"It's dead Jim.  There are barely any players or at least not enough to even grab a quick match.  If your only question is ""can I jump on and try this game out?"", the answer is no.   It's too bad, I remember liking it quite a bit when it came out."

3506,"Very Fun Shooter and has a very strong anti-cheat system. I started playing this game because it was a replacement for after the death of Combat Arms. It's also similar to CSGO but this game has way less hacking and much skill and it's truly F2P but can spend money to get same guns but with specialty skins and such, but you also can get a lot of nice weapons, skins, etc... from just ranking up."
3507,"Great Game!

Pros:
Mechanics are well polished, quickly responsive game.
Fatal shots, head shots & kills are immensely satisfying.
Sound effects are great.
Perfect blend of Counter Strike & classic Call of Duty.
Small size, nicely optimised.
Good visuals (for a DX9 game).
Guns are well balanced & almost every gun can be purchased with in-game currencies.
No grinding for guns, but for skins - grind.
No crashing issues for me (and my friends).

Cons:
Player base is decreasing but still enough to find a game easily.
Sometimes cheaters can frustrate you too much.
Player to player voice communication only available in Classic Mode (Plant a bomb/diffuse the bomb).
No distinctive game mode (all regular CS & CoD modes except for battle royale)."
3508,"awesome

3509,i cant play it not load
3510,"Very good free to play action shooter, its like: Warface, Call of duty, Tom clancy Rainbow six siege, insurgency in one game! There might be some plusses and minuses like: Ultra graphics look like 360p quality on Youtube, and the game is weird as you cant slide, lean, and have to use knife to sprint, but overall the game is good!"

3574,"it's much better than counter strike tbh
"
3575,"Best fps game for pc version I've played so far, cause it is the most easiest game to get guns with out paying a penny.
there 3 ways to get guns for those that doesn't want to pay money which no other fps game has(from my own experience). 
game is super easy at the start but gets harder as you progress. atm I'm Captain rank its really hard to get to top ranks in each game.

cons: there are various hacks available for this game in 100's of site. they've done everything they can but only the biggest hack program gets kicked during game. those who use 3rd party program and tools doesn't get kicked out. I've done a lot of reporting on the aimbotters, auto aimers, wall hackers but there is no confirmation anywhere to see if they looked at my report and banned the culprit unlike counterstrike go. 
There is also issue with those who has high ping. for some odd reason they can shoot and kill you even if their bullet 5 feet away from you. several time I peek or jump in and out behind wall or building, their bullet still goes thru the wall as if it doesn't exist since they are slower internet.
my preferred guns are g36(40 ammo), m11 sniper, p90(for short distance) and that combat rifle just before sniper rifle section and the .50 caliber sniper rifle.

as for suggestions it would be nice to have 50 ping -100 ping servers and 10-50 ping servers cause the game is unfair when you got slow internet people with like 150-200 ping. you really need to do something bout this report button cause we need to know if the haxor or auto aimer got banned or not cause it be waste of our time to report otherwise. 
you need to work on catching hackers,auto aimers, and other bot users daily. these guys ruin the game and keep saying ez at the end of game."
3576,"Wow...just wow.

back in 2015, this is my get go FPS (non steam ver.) . But now that i play it again, i gotta say this game is reaaaaallly a huge disappointment.

GAMEPLAY (HA. Like there is one) : It's a fast pace shoot bad guy you GG stuff. though it's exiting and competitive, this game and the community is just...eh. Weapon variety are great with amazing details. SOP items are okay and the events are nice. but alas good things comes the worst thing.  

I really hate how the recoil and the weapon sway is so bad. like, what's the point to put grip on the gun even it doesn't dampen the recoil at all?? I've been trying to control the gun and it is impossible while shooting an enemy who side-step like a person never go pee on a toilet for days, and it's been around my head since back then. Why the gun ALWAYS have only 1 bullet out and you have to reload every round start or respawn just to hear literally everone ""TAC RELO- TAC RELOA- TA- TAC RELOAD"" at the begining of the match. Let me remind you who read this, this game will change your way of gun fight. in like..a bad step-mom way. She's mean to you but you have to deal with it bc it's ur mom.

Matchmaking that i can guarantee you will scream ""WATEHECKK LVL100 ON THE TEEM QUSETION MARK"". I don't know, maybe because the players are so less, even the matchmaking will require upper player to join.  

TL;DR : game's dumb. don't invest money in here. literally you're an idiot if you do.

3611,"  Ive play a little bit of this game. i can tell you its solid in all facets.  gun selection is extensive.  Cosmetically it has all the fluff you could ask for.  Player base isnt the most engaging but  NOT TOXIC.   I would say  its not pay to win,but more  pay to look good.  Easy game play.  Newbies will have a rough time in the beginning, remember there are A LOT of veteran  heavy hitters. But  its worth the time. 

 would like to see MORE maps! pistol maps, sniper maps and capture the flag maps.

Great game its brings back memories of RVS!!

3623,"I originally tinkered with this game because the graphics and physics seemed a lot more realistic than other free FPS multi player games. Next thing I know 300 hours had gone by in the blink of an eye. 

Anyway, here are some (hopefully) helpful tips for noobs: 

(1) ignore everyone who criticizes the noobs after they lost a game. All teams have noobs and the criticism is not really directed at you, as much as it is directed towards good players who drop the ball. And the same people seem to complain after every game so just give them a wide berth. Forutnately there is no in chat audio chat so the worst thing you will experience is a nasty chat message (which you can easily mute); 

(2) with enough practice you *can* get 30 or 40 kills per game without spending a single cent on the game. However... After about 400 hours and noticing some trends in the guns & skins or the best players in my games, I decided to buy a gun (use the steam market rather than the BS store because the best guns are only available via lottery boxes, at least with the steam store you are guaranteed to get the gun you want for a fixed price) and a female skin. The difference is pretty noticeable. Yeah, the skins all have the same hit boxes (allegedly) but there is a noticeable difference in your overall performance. Just don't make that assessment based on one game or even one day. Your individual performance in an FPS depends A LOT on how you feel that day, who your opponents are, etc etc. Get at least a statistically significant sample before drawing any conclusions and I think you will find that a minimal amount of money can yield a pretty impressive increase in performance. If you are happy with 20 KA per match then it is probably not even worth the effort, just try different free guns and free skins; 

(3) speaking of your competitors, there is a MASSIVE difference depending on the time of day you join a game. The difference between early morning East Coast US time and late evening East Coast US time is insane. Mornings generally have lots of players who, on their own, can score 40+ KA per game and you will have people on your team and on the opposition who are total BS rock stars. You will still encounter some skilled people late at night but they are far less common; and, lastly, 

(4) speaking for myself and a lot of other people who have 500+ hours of experience, your performance will and does get better with more hours. It is just the nature of the beast. When I started, I was lucky to get 5 kills a game and I always used sniper rifles to avoid getting killed every 2 seconds. In other words, just because you are always near the bottom of the score sheet doesn't mean you won't get better, it is probably because you have less hours and/or spent less money than your competitors. Don't beat yourself up just because everyone seems to get something that you do not. 

Ok, that is all my tips. 

Hopefully more people join the game in future although, I have to say, that some of the best games are when it is 3 v 3 (instead of an 8 v 8 deathmatch) and you need to use more skill, accuracy, strategy and quick thinking if you want a huge score. The only time it sux is when there are not enough people for a match.  Which is why you need to step away from CS:GO, CoD, et al and try out this hidden gem."

This game should bring back solo q to stop cheater play 5 man and also make vote kick to kick cheater. This game actualy a good game if there are no cheater. I saw many player not using nade and smoke they just get 2000++ ELO, thats not gonna happen in CSGO ya. If they really wanna good in this game, they wanna learn some good nades (but they dont cause they have wallhax).

And it is a nice game. It has good graphics, sound, shot effect, etc. Sad thing that they lost its competitiveness due to the predominance of other popular game. I really recommend this.

This is a dead game anyway and alot of bots and noobs in this game. This game banning system is FULL OF SHIT! After appealing for the ban the admin is full of shit because they will say you broke the rule and disrupt the gameplay when i just casually play and get kills or carry those noobs to victory. Conclusion this game doesn't allow pro to play, only bots and trash are welcome."

The game modes are really confusing at first and the menu will take you a few hours to get used to as well. I will say that once you get used to some of the mechanics, it becomes a pretty fun game to play. Still would much rather play CSGO though..."

Is no pay-to-win (what seems to be pretty rare these days) and you got a large selection of guns and unique maps.

3750,"Valofe bought the game out, removed the community market, added more lag and desync, and a new ping restriction. The removal of the community market is a shit move designed to get people to spend more on lootboxes rather than buying directly the skin they want from the Steam Market. That is just greed! Also, with as small as the playerbase is getting, the ping limit really just hurts the game more. US players often are forced to play in the EU server since there is not a lot of us, but now we can't even join those servers anymore.  The game is totally unplayable now because of all of this.

The mods are also extremely corrupt and will ban you for criticizing the game. Consumer rights do not exist with Valofe. AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS!

I would recommend America's Army Proving Grounds. It's free to play and not pay to win, unlike most other games are nowadays. In fact, it doesn't even have a single microtransaction!"

3756,this very good gm
3757,"Played this game since 2015. It was great fps game for me. It has good specific ranking system, balance weapon, cool skin.
Since 2020 everything going so badly like the not registered while shooting, wrong server matchmaking that get worst ping. Cheaters not getting banned after report. Sad :("
3758,"Good game but not enough fairness between matches...too many ""pros"" mixed against ""noobs"" makes for a lot of dissatisfaction when you just want to have fun playing against like skilled players"
3759,good
3760,"Quickscope is love, quickscope is life. Sniper rifles have 100% accuracy on RMB, broken mechanic but makes the game fun. Probably the funniest FPS I've played."
3761,you can sell skins :D
3762,A very good alternative to other classic shooters like CS:GO

3767,"This is one of my favorite games. This will always be one of my most played games. Everyone should play this game. The mechanics are great, weapons are balanced, big community, and its free."
3768,"Best game ?

Nah.. just a random fps f2p game with shitty gun control and hacking asian kids with mini skirts characters..

But the gun control though is soo wacky and recoil is really wierd."
3769,玩了之后我才知道，原来我是个连人机都打不过的fw

3776,epico game momentp
3777,i had a lot of fun playing it but since csgo is free it's basicly a dead game. still very gud game
3778,Everything! :)
3779,"its free and for me its better then cs:go, it has ok grapfics and it is now demanding."
3780,"If you loved A.V.A, old CS and similar titles this might grab your interest."

"
3796,this game is good when you play with friends :)
3797,"It's a P2W but not totally. You can buy any gun with the money you earn while playing but paying just makes it faster. Also it's skill based. No internet lag spikes, no fps drops I am satisfied with the game. Did not encounter any cheaters. Reccomend it totally."
3798,this game is very fun the only thing is you need good ping unless you will get a lot of no regs and that mean you shot them but it does nothing but this game over all is very fun
3799,Good game

3841,"unoptimized, I have a more than decent pc and sometimes the games freeze for literally no reason
laggy servers, I have a upload speed of 500 mb/s and a download speed of 300 mb/s and I still get over 70 ping in a match
broken hitboxes, these aren't as defined as other f2p shooters
shitty maps, the tdm maps are fine but competitive maps (demolition) are pretty bad

overall the game isn't that bad but there's no reason to play this one if you can play any other f2p shooter right now

"
3842,"Sadly plagued by hackers :(

"
3843,Some idiot on youtube said that this was a tactical shooter. This isn't like a massive battlefield like the battlefield franchise. But it IS fun. It's the kind of traditional fun that you'd find in COD. Kinda brainless. But fun.

3858,"Good game although unfortunately dying. Gameplay is pretty good, just like any classic fps. SFX and music are one of its greatest weaknesess.

Too bad devs made a bunch of mistakes and didnt really knew how to keep going with the game, gonna miss this once it closes down."
3859,good game
3860,"A nice break from games like Rainbow 6: Siege, or Counter Strike."
3861,im trying to play but everytime i enter a match after 10s or more it disconects me and says that my internet conection is bad even tho i have less than 50 ping
3862,Game is fine for TDM dont waste your time with Competitive. Made it to cobra which is one rank below the top and constantly every game i play there is a hacker and or a lagswitcher. If your skilled at fps's you will quickly see the LARGE amount of hackers using PRIVATE cheats in PRIVATE communities that Battleye wont pick up at all. Its honestly disgusting and BS has made no public announcement or anything regarding the amount of cheaters that have flooded Competitive mode. Not worth the stress of getting good at a game and learning the maps and play styles just be trumped by hackers that will call you EZ even though the entire competitive community is aware of these hackers. They have been reported numerous times and still hack away as if nothing has been done about it. I have a list of the same 15-20 ppl hacking in the top tier competitive leagues that continue to destroy this game. Black Squad does nothing about it. ASWELL as a actual GM teaming up with these hackers purposefully killing their own game. Literally AWFUL
3863,"This game is just outright terrible.
The TDM maps are even worse than MW 2019 6v6 maps - Every map is designed for snipers and only snipers.

I didn't even know how P2W it was until I saw the thousand of loot boxes that don't even always give you a permanent item. This game literally exists just to milk the whales."

3913,"The only Competitive FPS that doesn't make me feel like a total loser when it comes to competitive FPS. 
CSGO and Battlefield can go to H with their stupid mechanics, recoil, hitboxes and bullet trajectories that make ZERO sense whatsoever, but Black Squad get's my thumbs up. This is where BS in my opinion gets it right.

There is no P2W here, what you would pay extra for in real money is just skin bragging rights on some weapons, which is totally fine. Developers, please keep it like that. 
Every now and then you encounter toxic parts of the community but in the realm of competitive FPS what I have learned so far in all my experience of gaming is that it's just inevitable. Just ignore, report if you want, but just ignore the sore losers and the calls for noob, the R word and so on, take it to the chin and just try to have fun. They don't deserve your attention. 

83 hours on record by time of me writing this and there will be more to come.

3924,"It's a simple tdm game.  The movement is super slow compared but I enjoy playing this more than CS:GO.

I mostly only play this when I'm listening to an audio book or podcast and want something to play with the sound off that doesn't require my full attention. If I were playing a game and using my full attention I would play titanfall 2 or something else."
3925,"No sh*t, they weren't kidding when they said this game is pay to win and is filled with hackers"
3926,its fun to play the game.But have some latency issues.
3927,"game is really simplisitc, really intense, really fun, and has alot going for it, its really enjoyable but if this type of game isnt for you then you can try something else. i do reccomend this game though i do love it, but just be sure to see if this is for you or not cause this game sure has minimal amounts of pay to win in it but its only minimal this game does not need paid weapons to be good, it is good entirely imho, its fun so go check it out."

3966,"Don't download, even if its free, FULL of hackers and cheaters, no anti cheat system to speak for, says it has battle eye but it clearly isn't working. Aim bot and walls like no one business. its just the red headed steep child of CS:GO and TF2, expect that step child was raised by call of duty and bullied by battlefield and siege on the playground. Seriously, its a 100% honest-to-god CS:GO rip that's entirely set up and designed to be pay to win and reward you for spending money on the game, but even if you do, you'll onlyturn around to be punished by the toxic playerbase and rampant cheating, don't waste your time, don't waste your money on anything for/in the game."

"
3997,"Black Squad is an interesting first-person-shooter-reality.🔫

It is about the Viper Circle, a lot of mysterious cases are being reported all over the planet.. 
It seems that the Viper Circle is behind all these criminalities.🪖

According to some CIA's report, the Viper Circle is known as an international corporation operating legitimate businesses.🦹🏼

The truth, Viper Circle is a ruthless organization, attracting all criminal forces& activities around this planet. This all just for profits.😱

The UN have banded together to form the Global Anti-Terrorist Taskforce formally know as the Peacemaker.☮️
Peacemaker's mission logically is to stop the Viper Circle, get the leading force, which is involved of saving the whole planet from threats like this terrorism treat.🕊️

In Black Squad you can normally decide between the known FPS mode TDM (Team Deathmatch),
demolition 8vs8 (TDM is 8vs8* also), demolition 5vs5, assasination 8vs8& Destruction 16vs16 sometimes there are events& event modes also opening on winter, new eve, Halloween, new year, my birthday, eastern& so on.😜

Guns are the R5 GL, SR-47 GL, EF88 GL, TYPE95, HNK416A5, SCAR-L GL, MDR GL, AK12 GL, AK47 GL,ARX-160, CZ 805 A2, S15 GL, TAR-21, K2C GL, M4 CUSTOM GL& much more get new to this reality, also skins for all gun, grenade, knife/blades, operators& so on.✌️

It is a funny reality to steer with someone, it takes a long time to get to the ranked, cause you need to get of the private rank& reach level 30 for ranked in that reality.💪🏼

I used to steer that with the wife I love, and I appreciate that time.😊

Just compare your achievements& you will get an feeling for being ready or  that you are not ready for competitive.😓

Do it like me, take the Katana& run like an ninja trough the battles!😹"

The first problem is that they expect you to buy 100s of gatchas to get upgrades and skins, with only a small chance of getting access to a permanent weapon upgrade. 

The second problem is the special ability system. The abilities are not balanced, and spam of certain skills will ruin the game--basically, expect to get killed by random air strikes, or lose the game because of gun turrets that absorb multiple rpg hits and multiple assault rifle clips. 

Additionally, you can't choose your class until you get your first kill, and you only have a few seconds to choose it after that, so if you are too busy fighting or forget, you will just have a class chosen for you at random. Since the classes are not balanced at all, this will just ruin some matches.

Even though the core shooting mechanics are fun, it just gets boring to randomly die to air strikes or lose objectives to turrets. There is no chance you will want to play this long enough to grind for upgraded weapons. Even though the base weapons have a very low time to kill, weapons you will get through pay currency and gatcha are clearly better, meaning its pay to win unless you massively out skill or out think the other guy."
4010,amazing
4011,"good fight nice guns nice feeling on the gun fire

"
4023,NO9CVE
4024,Its just really p2w and everyone you run into has some broken gun and aiming is worse than hipfire for some reason
4025,"This is actually a decent game, if you're looking for some military stuff.
But i'd defintly recommend buying games like Squad."
4026,e
4027,"eh idk, its fine and all but its not for everyone"
4028,is good
4029,nice ppl with wh!
4030,Game is fine for TDM dont waste your time with Competitive. Made it to cobra which is one rank below the top and constantly every game i play there is a hacker and or a lagswitcher. Spent over $250 on this game because it seemed super entertaining. If your skilled at fps's you will quickly see the LARGE amount of hackers using PRIVATE cheats in PRIVATE communities that Battleye wont pick up at all. Its honestly disgusting and BS has made no public announcement or anything regarding the amount of cheaters that have flooded Competitive mode. Not worth the stress of getting good at a game and learning the maps and play styles just be trumped by hackers that will call you EZ even though the entire competitive community is aware of these hackers. They have been reported numerous times and still hack away as if nothing has been done about it. I have a list of the same 15-20 ppl hacking in the top tier competitive leagues that continue to destroy this game. Black Squad does nothing about it. ASWELL as a actual GM teaming up with these hackers purposefully killing their own game. Literally AWFUL
4031,i like it
4032,I dont like this game because is very P2W but if you have money then idk it is maybe good.But if you just dont have money to throw then dont play this game
4033,good
4034,No.
4035,Its not bad for a free to play game
4036,"worst game ever .. full of cheaters .. competitive is so boring .. they only ban legit good players .. very small player base .. basically dead game
plz dont ever think abt wasting ur time on it"
4037,>3
4038,fun fps game

4041,just play it if you want to have fun
4042,l
4043,yeah i like the game and its fo free is good the thing yeah good luck
4044,"Game is a fun chill game I'll give a list of some pro's and con's from my time on this game.

Pro's
- Not pay to win, they adopted the selling cosmetic only concept from the very beginning which has been amazing.
- No weapon repair costs.  Most free to play shooters, like crossfire, warface, etc make so you have to pay and repair your weapons.  This game has stayed away from that concept which is amazing.
- Easy to earn premium currencies by doing daily, weekly, and monthly missions.
- All guns are pretty good in this game, haven't really found any I would consider weak.  (Obviously there are guns that are better than others but there are no guns you have to completely avoid in this game)
- Most premium skins for all guns can be sold or bought on the steam market place.

Con's
- If you are an NA player it's tough to find any NA servers to play on, especially in Competitive, a majority of the time you will be playing on an EU server.
- I know I said it's easy to earn currencies in this game, however, reselling weapons in this game has a terrible return.  A gun that cost 80,000 BS Coin (premium currency) can only be sold for 200 BS Coin and they cannot be sold on the steam marketplace.  Any guns that you can sell on the steam market place I would recommend doing that over selling them in-game due to you being able to make actual money of them.
- Matchmaking is also pretty bad in this game, especially in the competitive scene,  however this could be due to the small player base."
4045,ITS COOL A FPS. you can have skin on guns and you have a lot of maps
4046,Very good game. Better than Counter strike. Very good graphics and a lot of types of battles. Very nice.
4047,HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
4048,Nice game
4049,"good game , but u cant sell ur items"
4050,"Really Great Game, should add servers in india too"
4051,A LOT OF TOXIC PEOPLE I LIKE IT
4052,"best game that keeping for balancing weap, so game wont be pay 2 win, but lacks ppl playing, so take so long on queue matchmaking, and if it does its not balance queue matchmaking"
4053,good
4054,"I Demand Some FIX cuz Cheat is always fine the way

but normal game si 100/10 will play again"
4055,Like CS:GO... if CS:GO would've been fun.
4056,Very nice game.!
4057,very good games
4058,Really good first person shooter and not pay2win just play2win
4059,This was a good game.But its dead now.community has died.But you can fiind players to play.
4060,"If you like fast and unforgiving games then you should call my ex or alt you can give black squad a change, where it rewards the good player to a god like statue where you go from headshot to headshot. If you are on the otherside of that stick not so fun. TDM is a shitfest and so 5v5 demo is where the game is meant to be played."
4061,"Complete and utter trash! 
Do NOT purchase, play or recommend this game to anyone else...or...have anyone recommend it to you or anyone on your friends list; Otherwise. You WILL regret it!"
4062,"it could be a fun game if they could get rid of the cheaters and make it easier to report them. as of now you have to have video and send it to them.

Yang anda perlukan hanya mengetahui anda berada dipeta apa dengan efisiensi senapan yang sesuai karena tidak mungkin anda bertempur jarak jauh dengan SMGs atau bertempur jarak dekat dengan sniper rifle.

4174,Dev's did lot of hardwork but creators and whoever is handling the project of this game have no idea how to make a game fun. They ruined the game by introducing no recoil guns and people simple run and shoot which just spoils the fun.
4175,"This game must be removed out of Steam immediately! First is awful experience, second is poor content. And the last one is network experience is really really bad, although low ping but there is a big lag usually during play this game.

4219,The game does not demand a lot of machine power and Its highly optimized game play with great sound and definitely  looks amazing.
4220,I faced a bug which from what I read has been in the game for over a year now. For games like this having developers pushing update is a very important thing (especially when the players are dealing with issues). Without that it's not worth putting much time to it when you are constantly facing the same issues over and over again

Devs ignoring the community and the worst you playing with toxic laggers in same room. And they not dying with 8 bullets ! 

When you play melee mode its reallly worse. They can hit 1 km away with lag power and when you hit causes unregs. Beside that so many hackers in every mode. Wallhacks, macros, range hacks all available.

4255,Why not
4256,Fun game but it is overshadowed by the fact that if you are in North America you wont be able to find any NA server rooms to play on. Even competitive matches will put you in SA or EU servers where you lag and can barely play. So much potential but it is drowned out by the fact that the playerbase is so low.

 better free games like splitgate. dont get this garbage it only appeals to retarded csgo players with no skill."
4265,Good Game
4266,"yes
"
4267,shitty game
4268,"Heres my thoughts on the game
Pros:
- great graphics.
- a mix of csgo and call of duty.
- nice competitive playstyle.
- decent controls.
Cons:
- In my opinion I'd like this game to have full or partial controller support so it's much easier for someone like me who's paralyzed and prefers controller play.
- The movement isn't the best, the only way to run is to pull put your knife.
- even with your sensitivity on high the camera pan is still slow on snipers, knives, smgs, and other weapons. 
- there's a lot of cheaters I've ran across but not been able to report them.

Overall this is a good game for someone who enjoys a fast paced playstyle like csgo or call of duty.
"
4269,Its a good game and when you get good at it you will learn to never rely on your teammates cause 60% of your matches will be lost cause your teammates are retarded and cant snipe people who stand still.
4270,"Hello! I have developed bighas for this game but it doesnt just seem right. I have played over 560 hours of this game just to get scammed for all my nuts and bolts. I highley condone to hack in this game because its fun and i like hacking loly. also sub to my youtube el shamy shunk from walberg. Also i am brothers with mark walburg. But lets get to the point this game just isnt what i want and therefor im giving it a good review. Hopefully the devs see this and try to fix the ability to use boost pants and spped shoes witch is wahtc everone wanted in farming sim. Farming sim 19 is a good game becuase u can phyiscally and finacianlly do what you want in that game. you can get a dog and lots of other animals like the tractor. You can buy lotto tractors and get them stucvk in el wankis walls. But in over all i give Farming Simulator 2019 a 10/10.

4284,"After the last time i played  and gave the game a negative review on the UI the game play is fun 
the UI still sucks but once you're in a game  you have fun map range i have seen is limited but i only been on TDM  the spawn killing can be awfully annoying and there's lots of camping but no healing so it can be resolveable"
4285,go ahead

4287,"After 10 Hours of play time Review. 

This game seems to be well put together. A ""bit"" of a cash grab (but what isn't?). Overall a good time. Well worth the price of admission."
4288,its aight. Keeps me from thinking about how lonely i am. Lonely? Just play blacksquad.
4289,"If you've played any version of Counter-Strike then you'll love this game, but this game in my opinion is better, Better skins, Better guns, More people!!"
4290,Meh
4291,"Game is nice, the problem is it has low playerbase. average of 3k concurrent player, it will take around 200-1000 seconds to look for a match in competitive. Also there's a lot of pro player in certain server like SEA that have played even before steam release, they're wrecking the hell out of the noobs. it requires skill, although there's skin it's just for cosmetic use you won't gain any advantage from it, no pay to win right? Also, you can get free skin and sell it in the steam market because that's possible. Problem is matchmaking its not that balanced, you will sometime find unbalanced opponent. overall it's a nice game that aim for realistic military fps and im sure it's realistic enough. Game is fast-paced and movement is a bit faster than csgo. that's all for now, i just hope this game get more popular and we can have big playerbase so there's equal opponent for me who is frickin noob."
4292,"I just reviewed ""Racist"" Squad. 











* i'm sorry about what i've heard in US and i hope you and rest of us be okay. Cheers!"
4293,"I experienced a lot of bugs in this game, mostly connection issues. So its a negative review"

4338,good game with god graphics
4339,No support for the game at all its kinda sad really they true to rule over their game because they poorly survey the game. If you end up playing this game understand one thing about it. 1 Hackers are allowed to roam freely in this game infact the dms prefer it that way so their so called partners look better then anyone in the game. If you speak out against them you will be banned I have spent a lot of money in this game and what I got was the F U button for speaking out on one of their so called partners. You will not ever get a hacker banned in this game unless you get it on video them snapping to people but if it can be covered up the GMs will do it no doubt about it at all.

I know this is a free to play game, but I know of other F2P games being much more fluid in their design. If they designed the game this way on purpose, then... as long as you're happy."

4376,"In my honest opinion, its a good game but the guns lack some stuff such as bullet penetration, like it cant shoot through a box... and the body to headshot ratio, headshots are pretty much one shot one kill, but body shots, you have to spray pretty much a whole mag into someone to kill...

also fgs, snipers need fixing, if youre moving even 1 tap of w,a,s or d, your sniper shot will just go wherever it wants"

4428,"Dear NS Studio. I have extensive experience in videogaming. However, every second that I know this game still exists brings me unfathomable rage. For the life of me I cannot find a similar game, yet am inclined to believe that this is a ripoff of another game. I fail to understand how this game can be a ripoff of itself. According to Biblical scriptures, a game which copies itself (poorly) is a sign of the end of days. Perhaps humanity still has hope, however, as this may in fact be a mobile game ported to PC. This would account for the terrible visuals yet steady 20 fps. In conclusion, as most people have considered this to be a good game, I am afraid of confrontation over the interwebs and shall therefore award this game a 10 out of 10."

i give a negative review because of the developer didnt show that they care so much about this game, its like this game is not their primary, so they wouldnt bother. Maybe because the game didnt make that much money, but instead of that, its still a business, and you got to commit in business, and i didnt see that the developer commit themselves to making this game better, sorry if some of my english words is wrong, english is not my first language. So, better try other game instead of trying this game, guys."

I picked up the AK12 with my starter pack (1 shot heads) and have it permanently. Nice. Doesn't seem like there are any OP items in the shop for cash. 

Feels like a fun, fast paced FPS that I haven't been able to play since css/ca years ago.

I can't comment on cheaters yet but I haven't ran into any obvious ones yet."
4506,"long story short this game has a lot of actual hackers that make the game very difficult to play. but here's a story I told my friends that may contain useful info for others as well:

""so i just found out that blacksquad, a fps pvp ftp game that i have 90+ hours on, is not as good as I thought. I thought the game was fun but, I totally got my a** beat every match by a large margin. I actually put its high ""sweat"" community to work for me. knowing that I am out of my league playing this game I decided that if I played it a lot anyways it would help make me better at pc fps. (which was true) but I read some reviews to see if anyone else thought the community was full of tryhards just so I could see if others had the same problem or if I was just BAD. but turns out that there's a bad anti cheat, and people are always using aimbots and wallhacks ALL THE TIME. I would feel cheated, except playing against these people has improved my mouse and keyboard skills a lot so I guess that's one reason to play the game. training hardcore mode."""

4512,"The shooting style and gameplay are poor and not very accurate. In addition, the intended primary weapons are very weak, and virtually anyone who spends more money and procures weapons can score higher. In general, the design of the game is at a low and unacceptable level, and the skill and reflex of the gamer does not have an acceptable effect on the score of the game."

4556,the best game i have played in a while
4557,"TL;DR at the bottom!

Ah yes, yet another Free-To-Play online FPS game... I'll be honest, I wasn't really expecting a lot from this game, that being said, I was pleasantly surprised.

Let's address the elephant in the room, that being the cash shop and premium items. Yes, there is premium stuff, no, there is nothing you can buy to give you a stat advantage. The only thing money will buy is a currency called Bullets, which are just skin crates. that's it, so far. It's wayy too early to tell if this will evolve into something more sinister, time will tell on that front.

Since that is out of the way, on to the rest of my unduely long review!

Graphically this game looks pretty nice, animations are good, the maps follow their own colour palettes, some are brown and grey, some more colourful. Overall map design is all very simple and easy to get a hold of, the maps are easy to learn and navigate.

Textures look good, haven't seen anything blurry or that stands out as weird, the graphical design is all very coherent if not a bit dull. The guns look very nice and tacticool.

Sounds are good, there are a couple music tracks and they're decent enough, mostly rock\metal style music, some songs sound a little bit quiter than others but it's nothing major. Gun sounds are everywhere from unique and good sounding to mediocre and bland. The starter pistol sounds like an airsoft gun. However you can generally tell the weapon type being fired pretty easily. Footsteps are loud as hell, making walking a very important tactic to employ since it'll make you completely silent.

Gameplay is very reminiscent of Call of Duty meets Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. If you played any of these titles, you'll feel very comfortable in this game. The guns have almost no recoil making assault rifles feel very samey, they mostly are the same aside from varying stats, such as one rifle might do more damage with a slower rate of fire and smaller magazine size, while the other has a much large mag size, and fires faster but has lower damage.

The available primary weapons are Assault Rifles, SMGs, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, LMGs and Designated Marksman Rifles (DMRs). They're all very straight forward, however shotguns in this game are brutal, they can take someone out with a single shot from quite far away, they have barely noticable recoil, and they fire quickly. Basically, matches, especially in Demolitions, will come down to who has the most KSG shotguns on their team, and who sees who first.

Game modes are fairly straight forward.

You have good ol' Team Deathmatch which is addictive.

Demolition 8v8 & 5v5 which is identical to DE defuse game modes in CS:GO, minus the buying.

Assassination, where one team defends a VIP (controlled by a brain dead AI, mind you.) that can die in like 4 shots, as he waddles to a helicopter. The other team has to kill the enemy team and the VIP, or kill the VIP and extract from their own helicopter. This mode is very... meh. It's out of place and not fun.

And last, but not least, Battle Match, where you have to work with your team to destroy the enemy base, which are giant supply crates or something. This mode is where classes come into play, and it's pretty hectic and clearly the main gamemode. It's okay, it's certainly one of the better modes. The maps for it are quite large as well, which is nice.

The combat is very, very fast. The time-to-kill in this game is intensely low, and fire-fights rarely last more than a couple seconds. Pretty much every weapon kills in 2 - 1 headshot, in some cases like the shotguns and close range, headshots aren't even needed to take someone out in a split second.

Grenades in this game, unlike CS:GO, are lethal. While easy to avoid, catching one will seriously injure or just outright kill you from full health.

There is ""sprinting"" in this game, but it's just pulling your knife out ala CS. However the interesting thing here is you have the option to hold a button to take your knife out, and then swap back to the last weapon you had upon button release. It acts like a sort of sprint button, very different feature I've never seen before. Knives themselves are just 1-hit kills if you manage to land a stab, 2 - 3 hits if you just swing it.

In-Game Store is where you purchase weapons and stuff like that, and I was pleasantly surprised with it. There is really nothing to buy with actual money, and they give you a LOT of cash to start with. You get 215k just for starting and doing the tutorial, guns range from 96k - 192k, and they are permenant, no repairs or anything like that, once you own a gun, you keep it forever and can use it forever. Cash is very easy to earn, you get 15K just for logging in each day, 20K or so for dailies, and around 800 for each match completed.

You also have weeklies. They award Medals which let you purchase more novelty items, like player cards, side-arms, skins and stuff like that. A Desert Eagle costs 1,500 medals, after only about 15 matches I had a little over 1,000, so it's not hard to obtain.

Overall, the store is quite nice, the menus are a bit hard to navigate, though. It remains to be seen if this game will turn P2W, only time will tell.

Community ohhhh boy, the community... It's already really bad. Very toxic, a vast majority of the people you play with are actual children, racial slurs, hostility at the slightist provocation, you name it, this community has it. I highly suggest not interacting with the people in this game, for your own sanity, and the safety of your braincells.

TL;DR It's very nice if not a little graphically bland, it's a very small game (only 4.3 gigs) and doesn't require a sign up, the combat is pretty intense and fun, it runs fairly smooth, no pay-to-win as of yet, no timed guns or BS like that, the guns are easy to earn, the gamemodes are alright, but the community is incredibly immature."

4560,"After looking at the store page videos and images, as well as reading the reviews, I have to say this game disappointed. This game is like if you gave an amateur coder a $10k budget to recreate CS:GO. The little ""story"" in the tutorial is cliche as all hell, although I guess you can look over it because it IS a good and informative tutorial. Finishing the tutorial is also very rewarding. Then there's the audio; some of the guns (as other reviews have pointed out) sound like airsoft guns. A bug I noticed was that every time you spawn in or respawn, all your weapons have 1 bullet already taken off, so for example the default AR has 29 bullets in the mag when you spawn even though the mag size is 30. It goes for all guns in my experience, including sidearms, so it looks like lazy programming on the dev's part. I didn't really see anything talking about this so if its somehow an issue specifically for me then I don't know. Then there's the bad graphics. It's certainly not the worst, you can overlook it if you enjoy the game, but this is particularly bad because this game was released in 2019. Like holy shit. 

I gave this a thumbsup, though, because this game is free to play and it's not pay to win. My description at the start with the amateur coder is a bit exaggerated and while I was making a point, it was also there for laughs. There is no harm in trying the game out for yourself and I do recommend you do to see if you like it. If you want something easier and/or less competitive and more varied than CSGO this is a decent alternative. I personally just would rather play COD or CSGO though."

This game is a copy of at least 3 games, csgo, any cod mw (but not the new one), and warface which are all much better games and csgo and warface are free to play so I would recommend those instead of this pile of shit. Oh wait don't even get me started on the skins, They are shit and there is no point which just goes to show all they care about is making a cheap buck because they don't even look good. At least csgo knives looked good.  

Ps: the game runs like a potato

4571,"its very fun for the most part, except for one thing: diversity.
don't get me wrong, Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag are lots of fun, and the maps are pretty well done. but the fact that there is no special mode (like how the intro is) really disappoints me. NS Studios really needs to stop worrying about cosmetics and actually work on new game mechanics like operator skills and special abilities (and maybe beef up the graphics too :P). overall, if you're looking for a not so competitive experience, this is for you. 7/10"

Pros:
1. Good Weapon Animation
2. Good Graphics (High - Ultra)
3. Cool Design For Weapons, Meele's
4. Clans
5. Fun With Friends (Group)
6. Good Maps Design
7. Good Game Modes
8. Free To Play Not Pay To Win

Cons:
1. Match Making it's bad for somepoint like high level/ranked players vs very low levels/ranked (Not All Time The Matchmaking sometiems be good and make fair teams but the most time its unbalanced).
2. Hitbox and Reg's sometimes when you headshot someone you hear that you headshot him but no damage, i'm not sure if this related to Server's Networking or About Players Network.
3. Servers Stablities, it's fine but sometimes my ping goes from 64 to 500+ ping while my network work pretty fine.
4. Server Anti-Cheat not working most of times... (Aimbot, Wall Hacking, X-Ray) all of this hacks, hackers use it and anti-cheat not do anything maybe they use hidden hacks or im not sure about that but its still as Cons that anti-cheat dont work well.


well hope you find this good, but give this game try it's worth it, it's pretty fun.
i will keep playing this game until i get bored, because i love it than other FPS Games.
Hope Devlopers fix everything about servers and Anti-Cheat."

4594,Nice to play and weapons are not cheats
4595,"TL; DR: One of the BEST F2P MMOFPS out there. Period.

For the details, I'll try to keep it simple:

+ System requirements are decent
+ Gameplay itself was fun but not too grindy or frustrating
+ Weapons and other items are quite affordable
+ Don't really need to pour money to git gud (but if you enjoy this game, please do)
+ UI was snappy and polished, the graphics in general are good too
+ Plenty of graphical, audio, gameplay, and controls options to tinker with
+ Game mode are plenty but not too much for my taste
+ Many guns already equipped with silencers and laser pointer for a low price of FREE
+ In a scoreboard there's no death stat, meaning if you suck, it doesn't feel really bad and you could actually have fun in them quick, non-competitive matches
+ If you decide to spray money in a lootboxes, at least there's a sure chance to win the grand prize after opening 100 of them (they keep track of how much of the particular lootboxes you've opened, kinda nice)
+ Heard Shroud played this game too

- No vote kick feature. Yes I understand why, but sometimes we can be lil bit helpless in a match with them hackers.
- No ""test""/""try the weapon"" feature before buying like in other FPS games (e.g. CrossFire) so I have to loot my teammate's guns to decide which guns I want to buy later.
- Can't customize my own weapon with attachments and such. Either you buy that GL weapon or don't have them sweet grenade launcher at all.
- It might be an issue on my end, but sometimes when starting a match, I'm experiencing mild to medium stuttering. But sometime later, it'll be gone."

4621,"I RECOMMEND the game for the following reasons:
1- Free to play, not pay to win
2- Easy and non problematic mechanics
3- Great to kill time nowadays
4- No hackers in games.

I do NOT recommend for the following reasons:
1- Poor graphics, death animations and textures, like c'mon it's 2020...
2- Boring classical maps and map structures
3- No proper rank or league system
4- Gets boring after a while because nothing is dynamic
5- No proper communucation allowed between teammates.

If you are familiar with FPS shooter games you won't miss much not playing, however, if you are a starter in FPS games you might give it a shot, you won't regret playing it.

Secondly, the devs aren't even trying. The game has massive hacker-problems since a couple of years. The devs dont even try to get them banned.

4652,"4k concurrent players & the game can't handle alt tabbing

edit: ok I just had to add this onto my review if anyone so happens to go this past - you can run and gun with the 1shot headshot pistols in this game, complete 100% accuracy at close range. I have played so many bombsite based fps games, I've never seen that ever it's hilarious. You can also jump with one of the 1 hit snipers and the shot will be a laser beam right to the middle of the screen, while in the air. I was astonished when I did a random 5v5 demolition and found players actually doing this. I have 2 good pistols in the game at this point by 60 hours, tried it out, holy moly it works. I would have remembered being able to run and gun with the deagle in 2017 when I first installed this game, did they really add this in later?

How can this game ever be considered competitive when you can do cheese like this? It's literally inferior to csgo in terms of pure mechanics and WILL make you worse at FPS games in general if this is your only one. Getting headshots with the rifles is also very easy, the hitboxes are huge compared to csgo/cs source/1.6/sa/ava/crossfire/tf2 sniping. At least you have to actually stop when you want the shot to the head to be accurate compared to the pistols. They definitely made this game as easy as possible so new players (in terms of being new to fps games with kb+m) think they're gods every now and then. If that's all you're looking for hey you found your game.

People play a game like blacksquad because they don't want to play cs or can't afford it because they're young which is understandable, but now csgo is free so play that instead. I was hoping this game would be a replacement for AVA/Sudden Attack/Crossfire/etc, but it's just too easy. Sudden Attack and AVA were actually competitive, and you can already google around for the Crossfire competitive scene. Only reason you'd put more than 2 hours into this game is if you log into it every now and then to just turn your brain off so I suppose its good for that. 

Such a shame, I loved SA and AVA back in the days. The days I could just join a casual pub and play some good demolition with mechanics similar to cs games. Yeah I'll still play this game when I want to turn off my brain, but actually tryhard in it and participate in its competitive scene? Good joke. 


RIP Sudden Attack & Alliance of Valiant Arms, I wish I appreciated you more when I was younger."

The devs took some wrong way in the development of it, by caring more about skins than the real content they should implement and optimize. I'm not even going to mention the poor anti-cheat system they have, because that is basic to any multiplayer game. The real problem is that they keep going and going, adding skins, maps, weapons... but they never add some new mechanics, which IMO is really necessary.

the ping jumps all over the place and the slightest change in it causes you to teleport all over the map, the gunplay's annoying as fuck, it's like Crossfire with less recoil and an iron sight / hollow scope, a lot of shots are lost in latency and ping so you always feel like you're taking more damage and dealing less, the game has 5 fuck'n currencies, 2 are acquired in game, 3 from chests and the last one's a premium, the game gives you enough for one gun in the beginning and a couple of rentals, and of course the ass'n tiddies premium skins that pull you by the dick into opening your wallet, the skins have jiggle physics that you can't even see ""what's the point of having shaking tits if you can't even see 'em? 😂"", it's the standard fare, [strike]i can't pass a judgement on whether or not this game's pay to win because i can't play the damn thing over how much it lags.[/strike]

edit. ok, now to this game's credit it gives you a lot of free shit you can hardly consider it pay-to-win, but honestly this fuck'n lag's soooo horrible it stopped being funny when i got killed because the game kept teleported me outside my cover right in the open, i had entire gun fights ruined because i'm all over the place, now i understand why the gunplay's so garbage and find my self dying the moment an enemy's within line of sight, it's because everything's delayed and the latency cancels most of my shots, i thought it cancels only 1 or 2, it actually fuck'n cancels entire bursts, like for fuck's sake cant you people place you're servers anywhere outside Zimbabwe?"

4747,"Black Squad (previously known as Viper Circle) is a free-to-play, military-themed first-person shooter video game developed by NS Studio through a team assembled around Park Bo-Hyun, a former producer for Alliance of Valiant Arms, at South-Korea-based NS Studio. The game was released to public in 2013 but went through a complete overhaul afterwards, most notably the setting from near-future to military theme with some elements of modern warfare

[u][b] Gameplay [/b][/u]
Black Squad pits two teams, Viper Circle and Peacemaker, against each other in various game modes and maps that can host up to 20 players and “large scale” 32-player matches and allows players to call for airstrike and artillery support, based on a special skill system. In every mode you are allowed to bring three loadouts that you can swap between rounds. There is no armor, helmet or special ammo in the game yet.

Each loadout consists of one primary gun, one pistol, a melee weapon and two grenades. Primary guns vary from Sniper and Assault Rifles to Light Machine Guns and Shotguns. For melee you can use a knife, an axe and even a katana if you feel like it. Last but not least, you can choose between a flash, a smoke or a normal grenade. Once you’ve selected your loadouts and joined a game, you won’t be able to edit them until the match ends. In some desperate situations, there is also the option of picking the weapon of your dead ally or enemy from the ground.

Like every FPS your character can run, move silently, duck and jump. You can zoom with every weapon and there are walls in some maps that can be penetrated. You start the game with 100 Health points and when they reach zero you die. There is no revive or fight for your life. When you are dead it’s over until you respawn again. Range plays a huge part in the damage calculation though, making Black Squad a pretty realistic game in terms of shooting.

On top of the Headshot mechanic, there is the Between the Eyes feature that allows you to instanty kill every enemy, no matter what weapon you use, if you manage to hit them with a very precise shot in the center of their head. For every weapon there is a full list of it’s stats like Damage, Recoil, Rate of Fire etc that you can read when you are editing your loadouts. You can also equip some fancy skins that you can buy with real money from the shop or farm for hours to acquire them with in-game currency.

[u][b] Online Features [/b][/u]
Black Squad features three main game modes. Team Deathmatch is the most relaxing mode of the three, where the first team (10vs10) that gets to 150 kills wins. If the timer (15 minutes) runs out before 150 kills are completed, the team with the highest kill count will be awarded the victory. You respawn instantly after you die, there are no rounds and maps are small in order to give you non-stop action.

Demolition Derby can either be 5vs5 or 8vs8. This is a more serious mode where the first team to reach 8 round-wins, will emerge victorious. The main concept is the planting or the diffusing of a bomb. For the first 8 rounds, one team will have the role of the Terrorists. Terrorists have to plant the bomb in one of the two bomb sites and protect it until it explodes. Counter Terrorists have the job to defend the sites and diffuse the bomb if the planting is successful. In the end of Round 8, the team of Terrorists will switch to C.T. and vise versa.

In Demolition Derby each round lasts 2.5 minutes and if the timer runs out, Counter Terrorists will be rewarded the win. If you die, you will have to wait until the round is complete in order to respawn. During this time you can spectate your allies and help them via the in-game chat. This specific mode has it’s own collection of maps, that are well-tailored and more strategic that the maps used in Team Deathmatch.

Ranked Mode is similar to 5vs5 Demolition Derby with the exception that if someone leaves the game, he/she will not be replaced, although there is the option to reconnect later. When a new season begins, every player has to play 10 provisional matches in order to acquire his rank. Currently, there are six ranks (Racoon, Buffalo, Wolf, Eagle, Lion, Cobra) with three sub-ranks each.

[u][b] Graphics/Sound [/b][/u]
Maps are simple but carefully designed and every weapon has it’s own unique appearance. The movement and shooting animation is pretty smooth and you won’t encounter any graphic glitches or tears during your games. The bad news are that you will find Black Squad’s soundtrack repetitive and boring. On the contrary, combat sound effects are decent and I can guarantee you that you are going to enjoy the sound of killing some with a headshot from a close distance.

[u][b] Unique Features [/b][/u]
Black Squad does not have any unique elements to offer, but in general it’s a pretty balanced and relaxing free FPS that you can download to have fun and shoot some people.

[u][b] Pros [/b][/u]
Simple maps that are easy to navigate
Balanced weapons
Very small amount of bugs
Small ques

[u][b] Cons [/b][/u]
 No unique elements to make the difference from other shooter games
 Cheaters
 Some secondary modes are totally useless

4778,"The game's pay to win (No shit, it's free) so pvp is pretty much one-sided to whoever has the bigger wallet. So, ""let's try PVE with bots, that ought-to-be fun"". That's where you're wrong kiddo. The AI is coded in a way where they just follow a set path. They also don't flinch, this makes getting the first shot off useless because you don't get the advantage from the enemy being surprised. These bots are low-level trash, go spend your time playing Counter Strike 1.6, at least that game has decent AI."

4816,"I made a good review for the game before. But i have changed my mind. This game is a big scam. I bought some bullets (the superior currency in this game), and I bought some packs for my favorite item that I really want, but I get nothing except some stupid and trash currency.
The matches you play are good. But the awful cases are just a big money grab. Play this game if you want to, but don't ever buy the disgusting bullets. Just grind the game for items instead."

4859,"I have never written a steam review before but i felt it was needed for this trash game. I downloaded it because i was really in the mood to play an fps game so i thought why not try this out. And man was i dissapointed. the gun play itself was alright, it was pretty fun. But what really let this game down was the clear abundence of hackers using aimbot. It became very clear very quickly that this game was severely lacking anti-cheat software. I was frequently getting killed by one shot headshots by snipers the second i set foot outside of spawn/cover. And sometimes it wasn't even with a sniper, it was with a damn pistol. So either these people are pro level fps players, or they're hacking, i'll let you decide which is the more likely of the two options."
4860,I like this game!
4861,its not bad. it lacks a little variety and can get boring when you play by urself. overall tho it is a nice time killer but its free and you get what you pay for. nothing extravagant but a decent free game
4862,This is a amazing FTP game that is fun for everyone it is very similar to CS.Go but in my opinion better there are more guns amazing grafics and alot more hope on and have a good time
4863,REMOVE THE CHEATER
4864,nice
4865,"no
"
4866,"There is not a lot of free military shooters like it was for example 5 years ago, a lot of them shut down or got unplayable after patches and currently market is crowded with battle royals, hero shooters etc. This one is still going strong but lack of options is not enough for me to give a positive review. I will list couple of issues i found with this game:

- gun play is based on head shots, head shot multiplier is a lot larger than the others so in the most cases it is a matter of luck who will win a duel
- map design is horrific, gameplay is chaotic but not in a good way
- netcode is not good, you have a filling that enemies start shooting before u get around the corner
- ADS has no point in this game, firing from the hip is faster and has same accuracy"
4867,nice ever seen
4868,Excellent

4881,Out of all the **** games I've played for free on steam this turd stands alone.
4882,"This is a good game 
just like cs:go 
i suggest to add battleroyal to this game and it will be perfect!!"
4883,very interesting
4884,"this game is good but still needs improvements, such as server repairs and sometimes disconnect in the game for no apparent reason even though my ping is only 24 and my pc is good enough"
4885,bad
4886,Need help! Once I click play it brings me to the launcher where I then click launch then it quits the launcher and the game I need help with this problem.
4887,"under 50 ping, game does teleporting lag, can't recommend to friend like this lagging game. It's not my computer problem for 100% sure. way over spec on my computer."
4888,its free

4892,shiny guns
4893,Good game
4894,.
4895,"is this game dead?
Looks really cool but I never can have a match online, no players or I am doing something wrong?"
4896,Trash game almost cancerous skins
4897,its almost like CSGO but for my thinking it is better cause of the anti-cheat system works there is no code leak and its that people are not realy that toxic so from my a tumbs up
4898,...
4899,good game just bans people for no reason.
4900,"Got Tired of CS:GO and all the cheaters so I decided to give this a try. It's way better than CS:Go. skins are fairly cheap, gameplay is very engaging and theres always somebody online to play with"
4901,fun but basic
4902,e
4903,Great Game
4904,"The game was good when It had players and good servers, not anymore."

4906,"Skechers, you like me my gucci shooooeeeessss"
4907,kinda cheeks
4908,"Eh, its fun."
4909,its a really fun game to play.
4910,"훌륭한 게임, 무료로 즐길 수있는 재미, Great Free to play game! fun~~"
4911,"- Playerbase is filled with mostly toxic people.
- Servers are laggy (although not all the time.)
- Gun selection is weird, sometimes the guns shoot perfectly then a week later they're terrible.
- More hacks are being brought out, and a constant stream of hackers fill the servers.
- No location based servers, so you're mixed with 150+ ping players from Turkey that spoil it for everyone.
- Voice chat was added and although great, is mainly filled with angry people screaming in broken English.

Pros - My friends play this, I only play this because of them."
4912,"The game has good potential, would be a really good game if they fixed the lagging issues. Every competative game i played i got disconnected, every time, at that point i just uninstalled. I would have kept playing but no point when you're disconnected from server all the time. And the game is pretty much dead because of it, look at other reviews almost everyone is complaining about ping you will wait a long time for match due to lack of players."
4913,"It's like a wannabe CS:GO in beta testing. except its not in beta. Everyone is teleporting around and people are getting kills when theyre not even in sight. the weapons and whatnot are all fine. its just everyone has a ping of 180+ and doesnt seem to have any sort of auto balancing, (even though it says it does) its exactly what i would expect of a beta to have, and would say its promising for when it would release, except its already released."
4914,i like it
4915,very good free shooter game
4916,"Horrible, horrible connection drops issues. Got 4 server disconnects in the first 10 minutes of playing the game. Latency was mostly ok, when it worked. 
More than gameplay, it is visible from the main menu, that the priority of either the devs or their publisher, is the ingame store. Once I see more than a single currency in any kind of game, it is obvious what they're really offering."
4917,"Its a very fun FPS shooter game, extremely good graphics, and good physics."
4918,"Welcome to SkinSquad. 

The main theme of this game is... drum roll... SKINS!

High latency in game ? Let's make some  skins instead! That's what our players want! Okay I know that the playerbase is practically non-existent at this point. Why try to fix something that is broken when you can spend you're time making weapon's skins ? Who cares if the game ain't running properly. The last few match that I had were so laggy and frustrating because of the latency. And what can you do as a player to fix this latency ? Absolutely nothing! Can't decide to change servers/region because it's not an option like any other normal games. 

I had my gun reload on his own numerous times when I didn't even press the key or throwing my grenades and it doesn't do anything. Meh ? Also had a problem with the grenade/smoke count, would show 0 in the in-game display even though I had them. Didn't get a single match without someone getting kicked out because they were using cheats. Bullet won't always register properly for some mysterious reasons.

I liked the game at first as you can see with the 188 hours I've put into the game but it's just a big letdown. A wasted opportunity by the greed of the dev team.

Don't spend your time and money on this because the game is being run into the ground as it actually is."
4919,"i love it 
"
4920,.
4921,Nice game
4922,I love game
4923,"One heck of a good game! 
Lots of options and mastery as well. Balanced teams and you just push! push! and let the bullets fly! 

Fun and addictive, like another commenter stated."
4924,its very good quality game
4925,"Meh. Last time I played, I can't queue up in Ranked Games with the homies anymore, if you can't have fun with the bois in a competitive shooter, it's already a trash game."
4926,not very recommend very laggy even though i open youtube and then open 4k video and very smooth like your mom ass. so i unninstalled. goodbye
4927,The game feels like a mix between call of duty and counterstrike. No pay to win: skill matters not your outfit. Had a blast!
4928,Fantastic game! I honestly can't believe it's free.
4929,So so cool
4930,lol
4931,"A NICE GAME TO BE PLAYED AS COMPARE TO CS HAS MANY A LOT OF VARIETY OF SKINS AND VARIATIONS, A MUST TRY GAME OUT OF A RATING OF 10 I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE IT 8 2 LESS FOR THE TIME REQUIRED IN AUTO MATCHING.  BECAUSE OF WHICH I COULD NOT BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE GAME AT IT FULLEST AND EXPLORE MORE MODES."

4952,"Good game. Fun, niche community. Sadly, Ironsight is just an overall better game. Has actual gun customization and class customization; better graphics, guns, etc. If more people played Ironsight, it would be the superior game all the way around. I enjoy both, though."
4953,"started to have a lot of fun , and was a very nice game to play .. but after a while .. i was kicked out of the game , in the middle of the game , huge ping , and is just .. not worth it anymore."

4978,"I have to say it's quite addicting hence my playtime (>250 hours playtime) and really fun to play if you're not a complete noob with mouse and keyboard. This game has a lot of similarities with CS: GO and some with COD, its as if they had a baby and made it for everyone to enjoy... Ok, maybe that was a little weird. Anywho this game features modes like Demolition ( 2v2, 5v5 ), Capture The Flag, the normal TDM, Destruction ( which is probably the most interesting game mode ), the weapon only modes ( knife only, sniper only etc... ) and random limited event game modes. It includes competitive matches and of course practice against AI to hone your aim and reaction times. The graphics are quite stunning if put to their maximum level and sounds are great ( especially headshots ). Free to play, not pay to win ( it ruins the complete game ...). The only negatives ( cons ) are servers ( high ping spikes ) and management. Highly recommend this game for people that are getting into FPS games."

- Never Have Been RCE'D In The Game

Cons:
- Up To 4 Minute Waits To Get In A Game
- Not A Active Community

5034,"Hello, this review is based on my own opinion and that may be different from yours.

With that out of the way, lets get to the review.

Black squad is what you would expect from a free to play fps game.
Weapons and a lot of PEW PEW , multiple game modes (TDM, Capture,Demolition etc)
and the obligatory in Game store where you can buy weapons with real money or one of the FOUR in game currencies. You can grind the game to get some of it.
Playing the game it became quite obvious that the game is indeed fully pay to win. 
Weapons can be permanently bought, daily, weekly or monthly rented. The best weapons ofc. cost you real money. 

The visuals are quite pleasant, considering this is a free to play title. 
Maps you play on are simple and have choke point that get camped or fought on. Nothing to fancy.
Enemies aren`t bullet sponges.
The weapons have recoil patters that have to be mastered.

Major turn off for me was the difference in player pings. I just can`t have it that i get thrown together with people that play on 300 ping and teleport behind walls just to kill you or shots not registering at all. Major issue in a fast paced game. 

Overall NOT! recommended, but it`s free, so go ahead and make up your own mind. :-)"

5036,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life.I was about 10 years old when my mother said him,''If you ever want to see him graduate, you have to stop immediately.' Tears welled up in his eyes when he realised what exactly was at stake He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me . My mother said to me 'Don't ever smoke.Please don't put your family through what your grandfather put us through.'' I agreed At 28,I have never touched a cigarette I must say I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway"

5165,"Maybe you say that I am judging the book by its cover because I  only have 20  mins on the game, but I tried to play on my brother's account (first time I decided to try the game), but the game closed on its own, or minimized for no reason, the connection drops in my account (even with the internet in the best possible state).
And also I saw so many people saying that the game is bad and this and that.
I just  have 20 mins on the game because it was the only 20 mins I had patience to try to fix the problems."
5166,good
5167,"This game plays a lot like CS in terms of mechanics, but has some game modes that more closely resemble COD. Unfortunately players in the US are only going to find lobbies for the VIP game mode on a regular basis, but it is a really fun game mode IMO. Black Squad is by no means my favorite FPS, but it's well-balanced, has some good game modes, decent maps, and it's free."

The TDM are stupid and are a CoD ripoff but worse.

Movement also feels weird."
5187,Very good Game its very unexpected experience I recommend this game 110%
5188,"Very fun and very quick, you need to be agile and have good sense"
5189,The most shitest game in history. All the hits in this game is absurd AF doesn't really have any sense do not waste your time and data on this game
5190,"had more than 1.5k hours dead 2 years ago
boicott this game and company
ruined by devs"
5191,It's a really good game. Just quite disappointing that it keeps crashing. Can not open it sometimes and sometimes just freezes and closes itself. Otherwise it is a really nice game.
5192,Seems to have alot of cheaters despite battle eye. very frustrating but its free. dont give company any money if you play. dont reward companies that dont ban cheaters.
5193,Great game
5194,"pretty sick, but the shooting can be a bit wonky spraying wise overall cool game"

5200,Bad sensitivity
5201,Garbage full of hackers and cheats
5202,"Hi my name is Reese and this is my Black Squad Review!

The game is overall really fun outside of the occasional hacker. The developers need to rework the way loot boxes work. We spent a decent amount of bullets on a loot box and all we ended up getting was BS Coins and Spring Points. The game is a mixture of counter-strike go and Call of Duty. If you like either of those games, you will find something special in this game for yourself.

4/5 Overall"
5203,Awesome alternative for CSGO.
5204,Wow. Just wow. This game has some of the most immersive and creative gameplay I have ever experienced from the hundreds of the games that I have played. There are so many reasons to play this game and I don't have enough time to type it all out so I request you to download and play Black Squad for yourselves.
5205,no
5206,"Cheater infested game, company uses all resources and manpower to create skins and useless community events. If you can deal with all this, sure go ahead, gunplay is fun, few maps are really good, rest shit. (uninstall rust and sabotage pls)"

5227,"The game doesnt even launch. When i press play, it asks for admin permission, and it doesnt open. Im not sure if its just me, but its stupid."
5228,Good Graphics. Crisp Gunplay. Good overall mechanics. Would recommend you try this if you like fps
5229,Pretty fun free to play fps game! Had lots of fun playing it. The only bad thing is that it is pay to win.
5230,best fps game for low config after CsGo ofc
5231,"i lke that game, kinda 
lit for a free game"
5232,"After having enough hours in the game, I think it is time to re review it because things changes. no game stays the same like day 1.

the game is now poorly optimized so if you don't have a high end CPU, it is not going to be playable. frame rates could be as high as 300 and still suffer from stutters and unstable inputs so you need a high end CPU and very fast DDR4 memory to get rid of this issue not to miss your headshots.

the second issue with this game is developers.... they never listen to people and give them anything they want.

the third issue is the game netcode that weirdly gives an advantage to higher ping players when they peak and shoot the camping player.

the damage received is confirmed by the player who is getting hit himself not related at all to the shooter player so if he was having connection issues the lower ping player will encounter no reg issue, wrong damage counts and even having strange stats (like you kill 2 and game says you killed 3!). a possible reason why game started to kick players for high ping. developers did that damaged player confirmation to avoid cheating so shooters can never cheat damage dealt. servers almost do nothing, but only connects people to each others, everything is done on the client side so it is like a P2P game while servers barely do anything.

for the gameplay: the game is amazing. there of course some issues like having different vests which protects against some weapons not others adding luck variables to game towards less competitive play, but that's not enough to ruin the game in anyway.

Last match I played today was completely weird with wrong damage counting.

should I recommend this game after all this? yes I do :) it is still one of best FPS games I played."
5233,good game for play
5234,Its great if you have a whole lobby to play with or if you really love farming bots... its basically an aim simulator so if you are practicing for cs:go or the new Riot game coming out its a good practice tool i guess. But pretty lacking overall for content.

5247,balls in my face
5248,COULD BE BETTER
5249,"I will not recommend this game, why?
Ok let's get started.
Bad servers, lack of the developers to do anything about hackers, game crashes for no reason.
You think that they would've done something about this game to at least not crash during competetive matches ,naaah the game WILL carsh, you will lose your competetive points you tried to go up so hard and on top of that you will recieve a penalty beacuse the game has poor server manegment and the developers don't give a single damn.
Don't waste your time with this game.
UPDATE: they fked up
So they removed marked, beefed up smg's and keep adding shet payed skins.
Not worth it go play minecraft or roblox instead they ruined this game.
Like I honestly cannot give you a reason to play the game, it became so much pay to win that it hurts me...
like the only way to get guns is to open boxes...that is too ass if you ask me.
they did not fix the main problems with the game witch is the whole no register thing...
I cannot give you ANY reason to play this game it is dying and its gonna be super dead in a year or so max.
I honestly think they are trying to remove any player base they have left, it is that bad yes.
Or in short, Do Not Play this game, go play TF2 or CS:GO, not worth your time and my time as well I just hoped that they will fix it, but no, they managed to fk it even more I didn't even knew that was possible...
Sorry to dissapoint you but this game is really destroyed nothing you can do about it.
I hope you have a nice day and don't waste your time with this game."
5250,Meh

it takes quite a long time to find a match
also Battle Eye anti cheat system kinda sucks
I really Think That shotguns and auto snipers could use some nerfing
shotguns have high range while still maintaining the damage and auto sniper is just OP without recoils.

Game crashes Very often :( unsatisfied"
5343,"Pros:
- Good graphics (can be lowered to a smooth run on old pcs)
- Playability
- Some game modes (TDM, Capture, 5v5, 2v2, etc)
- Several weapon skins (it doesn't change weapon stats)

Cons:
- Anti hack (after the last update this has changed a little)
- Bad team balance for competitive games (sometimes they get you a difference over 300 pts - what is quite a lot)
- The game interface could be better
- You can't filter servers (you just can sort them)

Overall, after getting used to the commands and weapons you will get a lot of fun."

5350,"Game that at first does not look bad, unfortunately it is not well optimized and the servers leave a lot to be desired very high ping and few people to play."
5351,Game
5352,"After logging in over 400 hours in Black Squad, I thought it was time I offered a fair assessment. First of all, my background: I'm a 51-year-old North American who has little gaming experience. I am not a gamer by any stretch of the imagination, but a year and a half ago I decided I wanted to play a FPS. I looked around at the best option for my skill level and stumbled upon Black Squad.

For most of that time, I've absolutely sucked at the game because I didn't learn the proper mouse sensitivity settings until just recently. That certainly does make a big difference. I've also found a rifle I really like and am comfortable with. With all that, I still kinda suck at the game, but I suck less and am having a lot of fun with it as I improve.

I don't play Competitive at all. I'd just be wasting a decent team's time. Perhaps after I get a little better, I'll find a Clan to join that sucks as bad as I do and is willing to take on another one of their own. But for right now, I start off with a couple games of Bot TDM to warm up and then move on to actual Team Death Match for the rest of my matches. Sometimes, I'll partake in a Destruction match if it's available.

But overall, I'm really now having fun with it. If you are like me and are not a regular gamer but want a decent FPS that isn't overly complicated to learn or get accustomed to, Black Squad is a game well worth your time to investigate.

What's good about it?

- It's free! Need I say more? Okay, well I will. You can win in-game currency to purchase weapons plus there are daily bonuses you can get just by logging in and playing. Everything you need to play your best game can be accumulated just by playing. Black Squad is definitely not pay-to-win.
- Controls aren't overly complicated to learn and get used to if you are a regular computer user. It takes time to build up muscle memory in your hands to play a game decently. I have slight osteoarthritis in my joints, but despite that, it's not an uncomfortable game to play for stretches at a time. And controls are always customizeable.
- If you've ever played CS:GO or CoD, you'll be in very comfortable territory with just enough surprises to capture your interest in the meantime. Many players prefer Black Squad over those two games.
- There are many options for your gameplay style. Bot matches are great for getting familiar with the controls and finding your footing. Then there are matches where you play with others who are selected at random and matches made up of teams that have been playing for quite a while together from casual to competitive play.
- There are lots of weapons to choose from in several main categories from assault rifles to machine guns to sniper rifles to shotguns. But that can be an Achilles heel for some as the choices can be overwhelming for a novice gameplayer. Luckily, there are quite a few YouTube videos out there with lots of good information for beginners. A channel under the name LMNTRIX is one of the better ones.
- It has a small but dedicated player base, and you don't have to wait long for a game to start.

What's not so good about it?

- The currency system and shops are a bit convoluted. You can earn gold, medals, and Black Squad coins to purchase various weapons, skins, characters, and whatnot. And for each season of play Black Squad offers special points that you can earn via gameplay to purchase novelty items like smoke bombs with cute special effects. And then there are two shops to purchase things from. One for spending gold for various weapons and such and one to spend medals and Black Squad coins in for more exclusive weapons and skins. Personally, I think they would do well to put all that under one roof and perhaps narrow it down to two forms of currency for simplicity's sake. I want to spend time playing, not going back and forth between shops to determine which gun I want to purchase and if I have enough of the particular kind of currency.
- I don't play Competitive, but there are lots of complaints of cheating on the Competitive side, and the developers are putting out statements saying how they're working with the Battle Eye engineers to keep improving the security. They have recently installed a new in-game reporting system, so hopefully the cheaters will diminish as time goes on.
- The developers don't seem to update with new maps very often. Personally, I'm okay with that at the moment as I suck too much to get totally comfortable with any one map. But I know there are gamers who want lots of variety. Those types may get bored of the game within six months.
- The tutorial at the beginning you're obligated to go through is a little stiff and limiting on options which can turn some gamers off even before they actually start playing. But remember, it's a free game to play, so you get what you pay for.

But if you do want to actually pay for something to help support the developers in their quest to make the game better, you can pay for cosmetic items like character skins and weapons skins.

Simply put, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good basic FPS who is not a regular gamer but looking for a challenging experience of escapist entertainment to pass the time.

3.75 out of 5 stars. Enjoy."
5353,BEST FPS GAME . . .
5354,"Best alternative for COD and Counter Strike. Fast paced with simplisitic gameplay. Only issue I have is the lagging but other than that, great game to play if you are on a budget or trying to save up money to buy a new game or two. :)"
5355,Very fun game
5356,korean cs
5357,"play for free, don't buy their bullets or crates, it's bs and a scam the way it's designed, I put in 3500 bullets and got nothing.

Also lot's of the games feel like you're fighting AI bots rather than players.

Graphics and actual gameplay is really good tho. Lot's of diverse playstyles work."

5375,"This is all round a very good game. Similar to Call Of Duty, except free. Some of the maps are increadible and well thought out, though there are a few boring ones. there are new gamemodes every day, which are usually just small variations on the 8v8 death match. If you already have a new COD game, it probably isn't worth your time, but considering that it's free, there is no reason why you shouldn't."

5427,"It is a very fun game but its not like most games that the day you start playing you die every time you encounter an enemy but as you get better the matchmaking is horrible and also never open random boxes because I have opened 81 basilong matt black cases and did not get it. those random boxes are like a claw game they are rigged and the bullets are way overpriced for what they get you (nothing) so this game is a waste of money and don't even get me started with the bs coins. Everything in the bs coin shop is soooooo over priced because it takes me about 1 month to get 10,000 coins but 10,000 is the least amount who will pay 10,000 coins for a metallic golden or red type95 when you can have the same thing for 120,000 gold, and who is going to wait an average of 10 MONTHS to get a rainbow knife that looks like garbage. I am still going to play it because sometimes I will play good but they should really improve the matchmaking and the purchasing ways. ps I was having trouble picking if I should recommend it but I say if you feel like you like it then play it I still love the game but I am just pointing out things that should be fixed :)"
5428,"Fun easy to pick up fps game
"
5429,"the game run pretty good 
love the search and destroy and 5v5 mods nd all it's like if csgo nd cod had baby"

5431,"its fun, little bit pay to win, but with skill can you beat them"
5432,pretty good fps pang pang
5433,"very fun and very rewarding gameplay, doesn't get boring like other fps online shooters after a while. the guns feel great, the sounds feel great , difinetly deserves more player base"
5434,"Was a good game until early/mid 2019. Then there were no gameplay changes and the existing bugs/weaknesses weren´t fixed, instead they just released Skins. Most of the ""new"" maps were quite copy&pasted from CS:GO, with bombsites being simuilar to it. 

I really enjoyed playing it before that given Time. Maybe I noticed those weaknesses because i´ve got 500+ hours of Playtime.
I´d recomend to wait until they maybe fix the game and it´s anticheat (maybe even revive ESL)."
5435,good but lots of hackers aswell
5436,"The game is really fun to play. I tought it was pay to win, but it's not. Everything you can get for playing just a couple of games. Only major Con is that, game tends to crash a bit more than usual.
Also can be played on potato PC.
Over all 9/10"
5437,It's a solid game for being free

I've wasted soo many hours here and I regret it now I thought this game would get better but no sadly dev doesn't listen to the player they just want money.

thanks for reading"
5466,Fast-paced and simple shooter!
5467,Nice free shooting game.
5468,good game
5469,Its like a Free COD imo.
5470,everything you expect from a free time kill game.
5471,"It's a great competitive fps game, brings me back to the amount of fun you had when you first started playing cs. a pay 2 win scenario but when the guns cost 0,5 or less its kinda worth it especially when it's free. 

Con- alot of blatant cheaters and the anoying sens setting."

5483,good
5484,"Well, Where do I start...

I would like to start off by saying that this is one of the most underrated free FPS games on the market. It has many different game modes to choose from, and trust me (500 hours and counting in game), if you have a good group of friends to play with, this game will never get boring.

There is also a very wide gun selection to choose from (I recommend the AEK), and each gun is fairly balanced when it comes to stats.

For a free game, there are endless maps to choose to play in for the demolition or team death match game modes. There maps vary from small to large, and are very enjoyable to play in as they are very well detailed.

 Please give this game a try, trust me, you won't regret it. It is a free game after all  :)"
5485,great game but too bad hackers are everywhere on network!
5486,good game
5487,"if you like simple, quick fps deathmatch style games, this isn't a bad game at all, especially being free. of course it can get repetitive, but i'ts graphics are solid, weapon choice is nice, game is quick enough to not suck up your life."
5488,"Doesn't appear to work with Steam's 'Remote Play' feature which is essential to how I play games at home. This may be related to how [i]Black Squad[/i] has an insane anti-cheat program that actively mines your data, from computer files to your hardware's serial numbers, and sets the game to run at a higher privilege level than Steam will allow (Steam does not allow actions that require elevated UAC to take place through 'Remote Play'). Too bad, looks cool."

5514,gud game but make it better
5515,"This game is just a great game overall and is more for skilled players, most of your minor slip up mid fight will lead to punishment so this game is great if you wanna practice, and the game is very fun and has a lot of weapons to chose from and skins for your character and you, but if your a casual free to play this game is probably not for you since there is a lot of skilled players in this game that will punish you if you lack skill , no but seriously the game is very skill based"

5576,"played it an hour tutorial and 3 matches and in the third i had an cheater he just runs around and gives instant headshot

and guess what.......... the developers didn´t include a report option in the game gg you have to go to their website and submit a ticket 

and wellp there are a lot of cheater

otherwise it looks like its a good game if you ignore the cheaters but they cheat so blatantly + no report button so it gets a negative recommendation"
5577,great game great graphics definatley reccomend
5578,A bit of F2P fun
5579," A decent game, kinda like counter strike but with less bulky mechanics and many additional content. you wont know till you play it yourself."
5580,"Too much cheater.
Seriously nothing is done against those cheaters.
You need to record them (everybody is running a screen record during playing ??) and then upload the record with only 4Mo for the record ... Is it a joke ??

Anti cheater software do nothing, after hours of playing I saw only ONE player kicked by protect soft. It's a shame that dev' done nothings ...

Type of cheat :
- Kill evrybody every 5 sec through the walls
- Auto head AIM (Only head shot for a whole game)
- Invincibility (more than 4 player fire at him at the same time and he keep low life but don't dead)
- ...

Up to you yo play this game full of cheater ... It can only go worse with them

5586,"Alright first off if I could give this game an middle between yes and no i would choose that, but for the benefit of the doubt i'm going with yes. This game is like a bunch of other shooters, run around, shoot, get guns; easy. Anyway this game can seem to be a ripoff of games like cod but it has its own value; it is free. Because this game is free it makes it an alright game, its what you would expect from a free game, but on the better side. Good physics, alright graphics, and decent running for all computers. Fun to play by yourself and with friends, and the skins make everything a plus. Although there is a bad side, in some ways this game can be pay to win unless u grind out boxes or medals. With those you can get better guns and it takes a while to earn them, but its alright; its not horrible. Anyway in total this game is good just don't expect a crazy good cod game out of it."
5587,great game
5588,"i love this game cuz i troll
"
5589,"my idea is BS best fps game ever But But Full of cheaters Fulllllll
Black squad must do anything Like Cheater Vote Screen or hardware ban or somthing else cuz  BattlEye is not working good."
5590,Good game
5591,.
5592,"OK, decided to write 'review'. Played this game from 'Closed Alpha' (yeah such thing existed) when Neowiz was publishing it for half a year or so, then quit and joined after almost 2 years to check what has changed.
Reason I quit before:
- Lack of progression content wise, same stuff nothing new, everything is too dumb in general;
- Guns were there, but then started 'PAID' blockade for that etc;
- Playerbase: people were too stupid to pick proper servers so you had to deal with 300-500 pingers on Europe server and you couldn't play properly at all;
- There was no 'comp. scene' that would be stable, went to the cheapest way of sponsoring random people who wanted to 'host a cup' and basicly screwing ESL over (ofc they got 1 session, but later on scrapped it, guess too greedy about something idk);
- Constant low level players accusing of cheating, constant, you could do a triple headshot in a row and get called a hacker.. Long story short 1% ok players, 99% crying about hackers all the time, even during CBT one of the ""streamers"" (https://www.twitch.tv/infinityreign) this guy or Chris W/E called on Steam) was accusing everyone of cheating.. Well with that note you can understand that in general playerbase level was almost on the ground;
- Forums being just 'OMG Hackers' 'OMG this, OMG that' threads and not a single creative one;
- At that time 'Medics' or w/e they are called, supporting idiocity that was going on instead of making some steps to get rid of that constant crying they let and encouraged it;

OK two years passed, I didn't care about this game at all... Checked news page from time to time, just to see that it had no progression..

Today decided to check it, what I've noticed shocked me:
- Playerbase... idk if I can use this word, basicly BOT TDM bots running around in other mods, I doubt there is any sort of comp stuff and even there is probly noone bothers getting there or out of 1% of OK players 0,01% left.. I was shocked with the amount and level of what was going on in games.. if I knew I wouldn't have stopped playing and enjoyed this game a bit more before quitting, now it's terrible.. not a single average player... laggers over laggers, people haven't learned what letters and ping meter means neir their server.. not to talk about their level, I mean it's better to play against Bots in BOT TDM at least they are more skilled than majority of these things...
- Server and whole interface went garbage you cannot find QM TDM or any other mode because every 'thing' plays that 10x10 destruction, because they farm exp and idk in general what's the point of it, when you don't kill enemies, but claymores, turrets kill them.. Netcode is pile of garbage too, laggers teleport around like nothing, damage gets delayed you die instant with one of the teleports, thanks to laggers this game is even worse than it was;
- Checked buddy list like couple people played it, so it's obvious that noone gives a dam about dead horse this game became, there is nothign new content wise everything is the same.. oh they added map or two that's pure sht and provides no fun;
- Everything what has left is just ""SPEND MONEY"" on this or on that;
- Still seeing complains about cheaters, but not a single one noticed... people are just insanely bad and stupid to understand that there are no hackers and that they are the issue;

TL;DR game is dead, should be closed, because playerbase is below the floor of the level cap and devs probly no longer care about this game. Will never again install this crap."

5638,"like it but cheaters are  annoying

"
5639,"After 2017 This game became plagued with cheaters. It is now at the stage where Competitive is entirely unplayable as the mass wave of cheaters is at an all time high and the Developers are not interested in fixing it. They claim to take action when honestly the only thing they do is add more skins to the game. They killed the game market we had by removing 90% of skins people had, now they can't even be sold anymore. Which stops people who quit due to hackers ruining their experience, selling their skins to move onto another game with their sold item funding. They ban anyone from the forums who mentions their action towards hackers and if you ask why they deleted a post they just ban you from the forums. I asked why a Moderator deleted a post and was permanently banned by a Developer for simply asking such a question. I wasn't rude, vulgar or anything either. The game is run by NEOWIZ, a company i can confirm is very unreliable and they don't even pay Battle Eye (The anti cheat). It's absolutely useless in this game and every Team who was won a Tournament on here from Summer 2017 on-wards was hacking. Dispute, the so called top clan in the game's tournament history for the EU/NA side is a clan full of aimbotting players who have private cheats. Same goes for Archer, the Top Asian Clan in Tournaments.

Clan Matches are unplayable, Competitive Mode, Custom Modes, Quick Matchmaking, you name it..it's unplayable.
As a user who spent 2300 hours on this game across three accounts i ask that newcomers who see this review, please do not waste your time trying to enjoy this game..you won't like it. You may like the mechanics..but once you put a good few hours in you're going to end up like the rest of us..sick of the hacking. Save your time and Money for a game elsewhere. This is honestly pathetic at this point..

Anyone who knows basic c++ can hack on this game..that's why there are so many of them and believe me..the DEVS will fill your head with lies about bans, they aren't doing shít.

Take care.

Ironsight  -is a solid shooter and probably the best early access game.
The gameplay is good in the game, it is interesting to play this game, as we know, any feature of good gameplay, there is also a customization of the hero, which makes a big plus in the game's treasury. The project deserves to live. !!!"
5662,Verry good

5667,cheaters everywhere on nova days 02.03.2020. Earler will be better times for this project
5668,"The game had a lot of potential, but a weak anti-cheat and a very bad administration ended up killing it.

5674,"This game is not worth the time downloading as it would not load correctly and would not startup as it should. If this game was run by Valve and managed as such it would startup properly and have this bug fixed. I would write a better review about this game if it actually started up correctly instead of giving me the ""PLAY"" option and then completely shutting down. I think I've said all that needs to be said about this game. Wasn't worth the wait time for the download.

P.S. If you get mad at this review, just keep the comments to yourself it's just one bad review."

5693,"Lets just say don't even bother playing... First of all SOUNDS they are horrible most of the time you hear sound in the other direction than where they are. Next is HACKERS its way to easy to hack in this game from what I've seen like 5% or more games have hackers in them and don't think 5% isn't a lot trust me if you want to invest time in this game you will soon notice just how many hackers there are and there isn't even a fucking report system so how will they get banned if even the anti cheat doesn't ban them ??? All the developers are doing is just adding skins in the game and that's it. The least that the developers could do is add the paid version of the game just like CS GO. Overall the game graphics are pretty good and controls are nice too but there is still a lot of major problems and that's why I'm leaving the game. PS this is probably the first comment I've given to a game and that just shows how mad i am at this game :D

5731,"This game has been taken over by hackers and people whose pings suck because they join a match in servers not anywhere near their location.

All the known hackers seem to converge in the seemingly single US based server room there is, and it's not fun anymore. Being shot by someone on the opposite side of the map from around a corner isn't funny. The report button is just for show, nothing ever comes from filing a report.

Devs are too busy sitting around listening to K-pop (Just pop to them) to give half a shit about their players so they basically let it happen, just like every other FPS developer.

Until these issues start to be taken seriously, I will not be playing this game again. 
I'm tired of being told everything is under control when it's clearly mass chaos and nobody seems to care."

5738,"So this game is okay. It's kind of like a middle ground between CoD and Counter Strike. Even the graphics are in between, but closer to CS. It's fun for the run and gun aspect. Can't say there's much teamwork in the community. You can't voice chat, which is a HUGE downfall. Small player presence. 
The recently did away with seeing the deaths on the scorecard, so you can't evaluate your or other players' performance. That's a major NEGATIVE for me, because I use it so gauge my strategy to see if I need to change up my style. 
Get it, play around for a bit, but I don't see me putting in any more hours on this game."

1. We (Vietnamese) have to play with PINOY and INDONESIA (King of TROLLERs on FPS GAMES) => always TRASH TALK ; TOXIC and TROLL EVERY GAME THEY PLAYED.
2. HACKERs everywhere and still not BANNED -> REPORT on this game is USELESS (Smurf.S1mple , *XuanHu* still play and they are HIGH RANK, DRAGON at 4 Seasons)
3. UPDATE PATCH just for ""MONEY"" not for ""BALANCE or HOTFIX anything"" => they change
MEDAL GUNs to ""RANDOM BOX"" (♥♥♥♥♥ idiot DEV for change this game like PAY TO WIN) -> they wanna earn money as much as they can and then you can know about ENDING (they will SHUTDOWN this DEAD GAME).
4. They BANNED much PLAYER but 70% is LEGIT PLAYERS ; they NEVER HACK ; TRUE SKILL and When you (or they) do much HIGHLIGHT , CLUTCH , OUTPLAYED -> BANNED.
5. On this game, have a CHEATING PROGRAM called is ""TriggerBot"" (you can google to know what's it but i can explain some ""much simple"" about this program => You dont have to ""LEFT CLICK"" to SHOOT ; what you have to do just AIM TO ENEMY HEAD or BODY and this program will ""help you SHOOT that TARGET"" and you will get HIGHLIGHT for that (Drag Shot ; 100% HIT ENEMY) => some ""PRO PLAYERS"" use this like ""Ria-"" from ""KOREA"" ; ""Smurf.S1mple"" from VIETNAM and much much more players => This is Difficult to KNOW that they're CHEATING or they're PRO (SKILL).
=> ENDING and YES, i'm GOOD PLAYER and LEGIT PLAYER , can confirm that to you guys ; THIS GAME IS DEAD and we should let this go to ""LEGACY"" ; it was best but BEFORE (before they update ""AK74M"" and META ""GAY GUN CONFIRM"" and NOW , they just care about how to take MORE MONEY from this DEAD GAME and SHUTDOWN it when ""ENOUGH""."

5845,"Wall of text incoming.

This game is a standard f2p chinesium fps with nothing special about it.
It has different gamemodes reminiscent of cod and the gameplay of counterstrike but thats about it.

You have to buy grenades for a limited time like all games in this genre. Lootboxes galore, so much so that the developer ads more cosmetics and ways to nickel and dime players than they do actual content.

The hitreg is broken, headshots dont register from time to time which is a big deal in a game where you can get onetapped by half the available weapons.

There is no way to report hackers(and there are tons of em). You have to record a video of the hacker, upload it to the games support and MAYBE you ll see something get done about it.

The guns are horribly balanced, the first 2 shotguns struggle to oneshot enemies that are next to you but the very next shotgun you unlock can instagib an enemy from across the room, the maps incentivize camping in corners and are catered to snipers and assault rifles so much that they render the other weapon classes obsolete, the only time you will go on a tear with a shotgun or an smg is when your enemies are playing with their feet. 

So many maps have wide open areas and long corridors with little cover in them where you will get pegged by snipers and quite a few of the maps incentivize spawncamping with how open the spawns are.

This game will be dead in a matter of 2 years as it already experienced a large drop in player numbers so the devs had to merge the servers together.

I suggest playing csgo and similar shooters if you are desperately looking for a free fps. The frustration of this game isnt worth it and i wouldnt recomment it."
5846,l
5847,"They screwed over the player base by removing trading a few years ago, I lost a fair bit of money. The moment they removed trading the playerbase seemed to disappear, and I couldn't find a match for competitive, thus making my skins useless. Waste of 40$ thanks blacksquad. I won't reccomend because it's a straight cash grab, and will never reach the heights of csgo. Project A will probably outshine this, just avoid this game and go there."
5848,"I like Black Squad of its animations and unique maps, also good weapon and good development.

there are close-to-no bugs and the community has less toxic people that any other shooter-game.
I would highly recommend this game as its free to play and i personally had real fun playing Black Squad."

5863,"Actually terrible. It's got nice mechanics but with the amount of absolute BS that happens, it's actually terrible. That and the amount of currencies and timed shit. Some people will die within 2-4 hits, others within 6-10 within the same distance, same weapon and as far as I can tell, there's no rhyme or reason for it. Glad this is a free to play game so i don't have to waste money of this shit."

5881,very yes. much brave
5882,I guess the game is OK for a free to play. The class system is good. The problem is that the rest of the game is made in such a simplistic way that the classes don't really add much to the game. Also: not being able to run is just insane.

There are a wild amount of people using bots for a free to play first person shooter game. The game play is nice, the game modes are cool, the maps might be mirrored, but they span from large to small. The people using cheats, hax, and bots are the ones that make the game hard to play."

5915,"Wow this game is bad. Every map is perfect for the lazy camper, not to mention they are poorly designed. Multiple maps have one way routes that put you directly into the enemy span but not the other way around. Also, after hearing tactical reload every time I reload, I cant uninstall this game fast enough. I get it, its a free game, but I'll pass."
5916,"good game , but they need alot of work on  to fix bugs and stop cheaters"

5945,"Blatant cheater ruining the game, boosting people during event, always the same layout,
Black squad starts a new comp season, rising number of cheater boosting people (even with a crazy amount of hours).
Some cheater getting banned without proper communication around it,
Cheater create other accounts, boosting again,
End of season = Boosted people not banned or even affected by any sort or restriction, cheaters disappear, they all receive rewards (especially Top 100). Casual player or even hardcore players getting the minimal amount of points necessary to get the rewards left with minimal value or prestige.
Black squad starts a 1 month even, trying to promote clan wars, cheater number rise again, clan being boosted, some cheaters get banned, a ridicule amount of clan getting ""banned"", no proper communication, the event will end soon, a majority of cheaters will remain unpunished as well for boosted clans.

After many events, and 4 seasons there is still not an appropriate way to report people / avoid cheaters / classify people according to their behavior with a hidden trust factor or something like that. We still have to upload videos, right down every single time code so they don't even bother checking it themselves and we still need to pray for a reaction and don't even ask for a proper respond, if they don't know you can lie down and ** yourself.

By the way still a fun game if you avoid competitive lobby, event lobby, clan wars lobby

Edit we also have random crash while playing :D

5947,"Great Game, this reminds me of the old game I used to play. 10/10."

5952,Nice :()
5953,"This game used to be playable but as it got more popular the less fucks the developers gave, the only time you would probably have fun now if you get a bunch of your friends on and play. This game has a lot of cheaters now, at least one every two game there's at least one cheater. How the fk can you have anti-cheat system (if you don't then that makes a lot of fking sense) and still have a ton of cheaters on this. The game is dead now so I would assume that the developers would give 0 fks now, I came back to this game after a few months to play a lot of shitty matches where there is no team balancing at ALL, cheaters left and right. Had they just put a little time in this game it would be pretty decent but as I said before, its clear that the developers don't care. If you support this game by buying stuff off of steam you are stupid cause why would support someone who doesn't value it as much as you (you're basically in a toxic relationship at this point) and please I know this game has overall positive reviews you have to take into consideration the past of when it was actually fun, but just look at the reviews of recent, a lot more people don't recommend this game for good reasons too, if you see any good reviews they are either oblivious, lying, and/or they have not played this game as long as people who have experienced the bad aspects of this game that do over power the good aspects, there are reviews that are similar to mine and/or they have different things to talk about, but just read them and you will understand how truly bad this game is and there are so many other free fps game that are far more fun than this game and less annoying to deal with. Just do yourself a favour and do not play this game unless you genuinely want to kill yourself mentally, in a slow but painful manner. For the people who cheat on this FREE low-end fps game, get yourself a life because no one likes you, your not cool for cheating and I hope that you will die a very slow and painful death cause no-one loves you and even if it seems like it, it is actually called fake love. For the developers I wish you valued this game as much as you did before because then this game would have been a great free game for everyone to enjoy but sadly you don't and it sucks because I made a lot of great friends here and I wish people can experience the same good times as I did, but until that time comes (which is probably never), DO NOT GET THIS GAME NO MATTER WHAT!!!!! (Sorry for this THICC-ASS review, trust me I would say more stuff like the weapons because the are heavily flawed but eh)"
5954,CRASHES A LOT BUT WHEN THE GAME IS PLAYING GOOD ITS SMOOTH SNIPING IS NICE

5956,"Fix this game,its performance and functionality sucks very very very much. dont download it its very fucking frustrating and dumb. one guy with shitty pc can have 180 fps while another guy with godly pc can have 30 on low settings. its glitchy and it likes to crash"

5960,this game is very bad. too many hack in this game.
5961,i would warm up here for csgo
5962,Nice game
5963,"After recording hundreds of games, I can say that there are usually 2 or 3 hackers in every game.  Some are outrageous, others are very subtle. Some get kicked by Battle Eye, and they reappear about 15 minutes later.  Most don't get discovered at all.  Its really difficult to report hacking.  There is currently, as of 2020-02, a new one, where they try to make it look like lag, but its not.  This game has been pretty dead in North America since 2017, but it comes back in spurts.  All the typical hacks like speed, bots, aimbot, locators, teleport, various wallhacks, spamming, etc.  But sometimes, you get in a few games with normal, sane people, and its fun.  

UPDATE 2020-08-26: 
This game has gotten better since they implemented the reporting system.  Even with the hackers, it is a lot of fun.  Even if the reporting system doesn't do anything else, it at least relieves frustration somewhat."
5964,-
5965,I really like just the gameplay in general
5966,"DO NOT PLAY!!!!
1. no sprint
2. no swap for fire modes

To top things off, this whole community is absolute toxic (thanks to dev not doing shit against cheats) - so if you want to play this game, make sure to mute voicechat, ingamechat and your own sanity."
6040,"The game play was good a year ago, but there are a significant number of players that have aim bots, player locators and the like that make it discouraging.  I have been shot/killed by players not remotely pointing in my direction, by players on the other side of a solid wall and by players who I can't seem to shoot back.  The software to prevent cheating does not work well enough. I played for quite some time and the abnormalities seemed to increase every time I logged in.  Finally, I uninstalled and moved on to something more fair."

Also servers merger was never a good idea for FPS games. Lots of ping differences will be a pain to look at. Developers haven't listened for the yelling :("

6094,Not Bad
6095,XD
6096,"its good
"
6097,"This game is insane. The hit detection is satisfying and the sounds you hear when you get a headshot is so satisfying. This game right now is just satisfying, but due to being a free to play game that probably has a small studio compared to other free to play games there are going to be problems. 

The target audience for this game is something for most people that play shooters, but it is a lot like counter strike. One shot headshots and precision based shooting with a walking mechanic make it hard to not think about counter strike.

1. The first problem is the casual experience matches are found quickly, but due to horrible maps and high ping it doesn't feel that great. 
2. HORRIBLE MAPS. When being such a huge fan of halo for such a long time this is something that is still a little new to me. Spawns are very killzone like where you spawn in your base and the enemy spawns in the other. So there is spawn protection to stop camping spawns from happening. Spawn camping still exists though because people will just sit outside of your base when you walk around a corner and when your spawn protection runs out. Due to this games feel the same for most of the time. They try and mimic CODS three lane map design, but due to 8 play lobbys and maps being so small what would you suspect. The overall gameplay is super fun and exciting, but due to the maps being bad that excitement is getting taken away from that. 
3. POTENTIAL. This game has some serious potential with some changes to the maps this game could do some serious stuff. Also adding in something to the game where people can make their own maps would be super GOOD in helping out this game. Developers giving away cool skins to people that make the best map in a month would show how much they want their community to stay. When I think of counter strike I think competitive and community made maps to get better. Something that is huge for counter strike is how people can make aim maps, aim botz, and other things to play with your friends and improve at one certain thing. 
4. Low Minimum Requirements. This is something that is super helpful since people that have worse computers that can't run fortnite or other games can play with their friends that might have better computers.

Overall this game is good, but it could be something really big with good marketing and good maps and recognition from the community. There is something special about this game and I can see this being one of the bigger competitive and casual games out there."

Where you can have a 50% speed boost from armor, and other pieces of gear...."
6154,nice game
6155,Good Game
6156,"jogo era muito bom mais ta pesado ta dando uns lag loco
"
6157,"super

6158,"Great free game, but needs more players and is just worse cs:go and siege
"
6159,very good
6160,"This game is fantastic, goes beyond expectation, but, everyone will tell you the pros, letme tell you all the cons this game has, 
1. FPS drop is huge, mostly happens during enemy encounters.
2. Ping issues, some players are facing constant ping issues and hit registration issues.
3. G*Y guns, hell yeah, there are guns with 0 recoil. This is irritating when players just spam blindly and this removes the skill factor required to use a gun.
4. Decreasing player base, from last year when the game was in BETA, players are decreasing very fast. Back then there were 4K+ players(around feb2019) and now it has only 2k active players(jan2020). 
5. I don't know why but the only thing developers do is to add skins and more skins. No one cares about the content anymore.
6. This is all i got to say about this game, it is one of my favourite FPS game. I like this game over CSGO, but due to poor development the game is dying. I hope it won't die any soon so you can still download and try by yourself after reading this review. 
Well if you want some Black Squad content you can visit my channel on youtube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc1qPYfs5NzwpZ15U-hBMUA?view_as=subscriber. 

THANKS FOR READING, have a nice game."
6161,"The game used to be good , the movement and shooting physics used to be better , now its just a trash game that makes no sense and everything u do feels weird and stupid"

6169,the headshots have fantastic sound and feel
6170,one of my go to games
6171,its ok
6172,the gun selection this game offers is pretty cool. it is a pretty awesome game.
6173,"Awesome game, I have a lot of fun playing with this game. I would totally recommend this game to other people, its free!!!"
6174,Playable Game Devs need To Care About it Just a Lil Bit More
6175,yes
6176,good game
6177,"A wonderful Game. Surprisingly well made for a free game. this, in my opinion, i would recommend more than COD, since you dont have all the ""bro my xbox just turned off im not kidding"" dudes. yes there is voicechat but you have the ability to turn that off."
6178,Very fun because every single player is so bad.
6179,"Good game, enjoyable, with decent graphics.  It provides a decent alternative to CS-GO which sets the benchmark for these kind of games.  Graphics are well presented, but not so demanding that it won't run happily on older set ups too. 

Nice game mechanics and playability.  Maps are well presented.  Pre-game user interface not as clean and tidy as it might be, but easy enough to navigate.  Game offers the usual 'skins' for guns etc if that's your thing, but is in no way 'pay to win' which keeps a casual games like me happy. 

I like the way grenades, smoke, flash etc are all available during 'deathmatch' games unlike GSGO, and I also like the way there appears to be far less hackers, and far less in-game abuse than CSGO.  Game formats are otherwise pretty much standard 'killteam', 'bomb' for this kind of game.

Servers don't seem altogether stable all of the time.  I had the game go down on me once in a 2-hour session, and a couple of other times where map wouldn't load 1st go.  Aside from that minor gripe - which I am sure will be addressed in the course of time - this game is very playable, enjoyable, and highly recommended."
6180,-------iosidkwjuiiujreui9dwkdfmej
6181,Good game
6182,its more like CS:GO with ADS.Its a good game.
6183,Budget CSGo
6184,good game
6185,Pretty solid for a free FPS.
6186,A little like counter strike but quite enjoyable. Only 4 hours in and a great way to laze away a few hours.
6187,2nd best shooter
6188,How about no.
6189,fun
6190,yars
6191,i killed a man in this game
6192,this hoe fun cuz.
6193,i like the guns but the grenade launcher is alittle bit of a hasel and somtimes the guns from the loot boxes are so low like i can buy 50 boxes and still not get anything but overall i like the game
6194,its a great game
6195,"Great game, takes some time getting used to the mechanics if you come from Cs"
6196,exel;lence
6197,"Good game overall, it’s a shame it gets run down with hackers...apart from that, good fun with nice looking skins"

6207,One of the best FPS game that I have ever played.
6208,Great game. Like the controls and modes and the way its played. It does aggravate me a little when games have items that only last a specific amount of time tho.
6209,Good
6210,Perfectly in fps game . Proud of you thanks good luck and hav fun
6211,Good game
6212,":)
"
6213,"Full of Hackers. Waste of time.
AVA it was better (but full of hackers too)"
6214,"ITS NOT BAD I ONLY PLAY it when im bored so
"
6215,i got free money playing this game. and pretty much money
6216,Dead game.
6217,"Better than cs go, 48+ maps. Game is free to play. A good anti cheat. Name and shame kick from servers if found cheating. Enjoy game so much even bought the weapon dlc packs. Game does not have local servers for ZA players but matchmaking is ping balanced. Two thumbs up."
6218,Some games you get called a hacker for killing someone twice and other games you walk out of base and explode from six grenades at the same time.
6219,"Its fun, except it sucks and its dying."
6220,dheye
6221,Dunno what to say but yeah atleast a great game
6222,fun to play once every year
6223,ok
6224,skrr
6225,Its harder than csgo and u need some time to get the aim but overall its very good game!
6226,hackers everywhere dont bother
6227,love bleskad
6228,great first view player with quick respawn
6229,retarded match making system
6230,"Nah mate, not many players and they're all toxic. The turks sweat this game, they can't afford call of duty so here they are."
6231,На пару раз.
6232,When valove breakdown the system and everything it goes from good to worst. Hate to say this. u did a great job by destroying the game. u change the buyying system and etc its worst idea u got. u want to make this game to pay to fun right?? if u got no money dont play it?? u cant do that... its fake now like the box it said permanent and u get rubbish. now its not recommended to play this game. u failed valove. lets move to call of duty warzone or valorant its better then this dead game.
6233,"Cheaters are everywhere !! matchmaking is Sh!t ...There's no kick out system, i always find myself with an afk teammate or someone who keeps trolling in competetive matches and you can do nothing about it. Same events every year , and all we get from the updates is more and more Skins ! oh and there's no trading anymore :D 
PS: i won't even talk about the maps xD"
6234,This Game has lost its flair a long time ago. First they removed the solo duo Competetiv mode which was great for uhh ehh solo players. And the balancing of the matchmaking is incredible shit. u can be the best player and having a k/d of 1.5 or more and then u still lose in a row a few games and lose as much points as the others great isnt it. This game just have a very small community base left and they have lost me too. Because they are not even thinking about changing something as long as they can get some money from skins and boxes. Good Job for ruining the funny and good part. Because not everyone want to play in a full premade team. GJ honestly.
6235,great free shooter game
6236,its ok
6237,Real FPS
6238,Decent for a free game! Would prefer CSGO though.
6239,Only problem is hackers but other then that 10/10
6240,I wasted 1000 hours of my life in total hours. Great
6241,"Nice game ^_^
"
6242,unless you like hacker
6243,"I hate this game, the devs basically gave up on this shit game. Played in the beta and loved it and then when it released it was garbo. Overall 3/10 lol. Don't even bother"
6244,"Hanya orang goblok yg maen game penuh cheaters. macros, wallhack, DLL . mampus aja lu semua. this game is trash full of cheaters !!"
6245,best game
6246,"Just like cs;go
"
6247,Solid F2P shooter with no jacked pay2win model. Feels good.
6248,The rooms took 5+ mins to fill
6249,"I'll be honest with you chief, this is a pretty shit game.
Don't play this for your own sake."
6250,Full of hackers and devs refuse to make it easy against them.
6251,GOOD FPS NAISU
6252,nice game
6253,"There is so much wrong with this game that there is no possible way to list it in the format that Steam allows. 
Stay away from this hot piece of garbage, there are better free to play games out there."
6254,very nice FPS game to play.
6255,"The game is fun, but very p2w. It has a crazy amount of grinding to get any sort of weapon. Stay away and just go install csgo. It's free now."
6256,Somewhat Good
6257,"The game is 'okay' but has some problems with matchmaking (i.e. no one plays the game so you can't find matches at all; r̶e̶m̶i̶n̶d̶s̶ ̶m̶e̶ ̶a̶ ̶l̶o̶t̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶G̶r̶i̶d̶ ̶2̶ ̶o̶n̶l̶i̶n̶e̶ ̶m̶a̶t̶c̶h̶e̶s̶) and the player vs A.I. is broken since the AI don't do anything except stand there and look at you (Now I know and understand why people were gung ho on killing androids in Detroit: Become Human).
If it weren't for that, the game would be better but as of today, its a 6.5/10 for me."
6258,LEtsGO!!!!
6259,m4a1 and ak74 killed this game.Dead game
6260,very nice game
6261,good game
6262,this so nc game i've love it so much cause its like a kos kill on sight
6263,I like the game. it is fun and its free
6264,This game is nothing like Halo
6265,good game
6266,"Really not a bad game tbh. It's free,it's a decent mash of CSGO and COD. By that I mean the graphics are dated and hip firing is  better  then ads. Wait times in the lobby are not long and atm there is 3k people playing,that is more than people watching COD on Twitch. I haven't played to much,but it's fun,though some people just one shot you with the same gun you are using. I am confused about that. But I have seen peole removed for hacking, I find that pretty decent. Over all so far I'd say go for it if you like fps games. Also RIP to my kd,I don't know the maps and got shit on. 

9.5/10"
6267,Nice
6268,Tbh it's a discount Call of Duty where the announcer sounds like a 20 year old nerd with tissues shoved up his nose because of a cold. It's ok-ish.
6269,"You can shift walk to a location where you are hidden to be instantly prefired by some low level dude at any time, feels like the anti-cheat does nothing."
6270,cool
6271,This game is trash...

6280,hi
6281,no
6282,"i really like playing this game.. this game not a Pay 2 Win game.
But.. i hate 1 thing... the matchmaking in this game is SUCK!!
when u play competitive .. sometimes you who are on the SEA or other server are placed on another server which makes your ping high.
I hate that ... Competitive should be included in QuickMatch (auto match), it makes you enter your server, with your best ping, but in reality.. u play compe with 200 ping+ , sometime can up to 400ping+
& the balancing for rank is SUCK too
somehow ur rank is WOLF.. u can fight one who rank Lion.. or maybe cobra.. 
(I have felt everything I wrote above)
Need to FIX !!!!
(sorry for bad english)"
6283,"
I feel there is still a cheat, please tighten the security of the game from all players who use illegal programs or the like. so the game can be comfortable and last long. Permanent banned from steam"

6305,This game is actual dogshit constantly putting you in EU servers when your NA getting 140+ms against players with 20ms this includes comp setting as well all in all this game is fucking trash tier
6306,very bad
6307,"The movement is very fluid, it's clean, smooth and very responsive. It runs on unreal engine 3. the graphics are fairly decent for an unreal 3 engine game, not the best that can be done with unreal engine 3 but good enough and from the free to play perspective they are pretty good."

6330,Very nice and fast action game. unlike cs actually you will have fun shooting people more and its more nice on the graphics i say. So much more variety on weapons as well. Not a single awp but many versions of sniper. as well as any gun you can possibly imagine.
6331,Yos
6332,so easy killing enemy in this game
6333,"é um otimo jogo , joguei na minha main por mais de 1k de horas ... vale mt a pena"

6351,"i know some people might complain about cheats in this game but honestly, compared to other games like Ironsight for example, black squad almost has not cheaters in every matches. every time i found a cheater, the game itself just kicked them without having players reporting them.

just make sure you are not playing the gemscool version of black squad, kekw"
6352,"this is a cool game
"
6353,nice
6354,Not a pay 2 win game. Great game mechanics and its  just like playing csgo but with shitty graphics.
6355,lotsa fun
6356,Great go to game when bored (and its free) I end up playing this over lots of games i've purchased.
6357,Oyun gayet güzel.
6358,пщщщщщ
6359,"If you are bored of csgo or any other game, this is the perfect game for you! With its one shot sniper its a perfect way to play a different style of game."
6360,Cool
6361,"why you have full servers
"
6362,Best FTP FPS on steam... definitely:D Amazed how good it is
6363,This is a very fun shooting and action game. Have less hacker after trying this game. Really recommend to people who would like to play some shooting game. I am actually a ex-csgo player but feeling disappointed with all sort of hacker when playing CS-GO after the game have become free.

6424,thanks to all for banned iranians yea go hell and ban us ty for your team
6425,"How to play this game:

Walk forward for ~4 seconds
See an enemy
Die faster than is humanly possible
Respawn
Repeat infinitely

Not to mention:
Most guns are on ""timers"" 3/5/7/day rentals. You can buy permanent guns, but they often cost a special currency which takes variable amounts of time to farm
LOOT CRATES, AND TRASH ONES AT THAT
regularly having 150+ ping players who lag the entire fucking game and make it so you're teleporting back behind corners you just passed and disorienting you. ALL. THE. TIME. doesn't matter if you have 30 ping.
TTK of less than 2 seconds
CS:GO esque aiming where if you're moving, the bullets DO NOT end up in the crosshair, especially in sniper rifles where you think your crosshair is directly on them and POOF bullet deviates to the edge of the scope with no explanation.

Fuck this game an any like it."
6426,its free it fun what else can i say
6427,Black squad yeahhhhh!
6428,p2w af wtf
6429,its very nice..
6430,"One of the worst EGO shooters there is.
The servers are full of hackers, players with a 100+ ping or toxic kids.

The report system was revised. Unfortunately nobody seems to be working on it, since obvious Aimbot users can still run around freely even if they have been reported in three different games.

The latest silly thing is that they removed the kill counters in the random game, yeah a shooter without a kill counter is awesome.

Competitive games are the next thing that is really badly solved. 1st team 3 wolves and 2 eagles against 2 lions and 3 unranked... mmhhh Mathematically the game is balanced, but reality is different. The 2 lions kill all 5 opponents with a 360 jump with the great gun. Great.

At the moment the servers break down again and again. Either you can't start the game at all or you will be kicked out in the middle of the game. Also not seldomly you get a server where everyone has a ping of 200+."

6460,"The new developers for this game have turned this thing into a piece of shit that only cares about making as much money as they can and not actually making new things for this game. Such as the new battle pass that they released. It only contains one single permanent skin. And they also took away the steam market because they didn't like the fact that they wern't able to make as much money off of it. This used to be a really fun game where I spent most of my days grinding just to get better. But now the game is so boring because there is nothing to grind too. I'm not willing to pay any money more money for these shitty skins that they try to pass off as something that would cost $100 in real life money. There is nothing to grind too and absolutely nothing that you can spend in game currency on that would actually be worth spending countless hours trying to get out of a box. One last terrible thing that the game developers did. They added these gold boxes that you are constantly getting but yet you never seem to get any keys out of the boxes no matter how much you try. There is nothing you can get that would open those boxes that wouldn't require you to pay money for some dumb keys. And even if you do have some money laying around in you're steam wallet, at that point opening those boxes have no use because they have the smallest chance of ever giving you anything good. This game used to be good but has turned into another money scheme where making the game as better for the player as possible is a ghost of an idea."
6461,"When you hang out with your poor friends and you become part of the ""Black Squad"""
6462,good Game !!

6472,"nice !
"
6473,"Im a OG player on here, ofc, playing for over 1 year. And in my opinion, back when CSGO used to be 15 bucks, this game would have been great. No cheaters, any pc to play and etc. But since CSGO became free, Black Sqiads popularity started going down, but still it is played by people and the devs are still working on making it better."
6474,Is good 4 a free game

6485,This Is Very Good Game With Free .But Hackers In game
6486,GOOD GAME
6487,Basically a knock off CSGO with a hint of COD
6488,"One of the best F2P FPS games out there in the store. It's basically a combination of call of duty and counter strike in one game, most people say its pay to win but in my opinion these people are just lazy to grind levels to get the medals and spend them in medal shop and getting the best guns like (AK-47 GL or AK12). In my opinion the game is worth giving a try and can be a challenge for people who like getting achievements since it requires alot of time and dedication to get them"
6489,"Wish there was a better UI, Game itself is pretty cool, and its free to play!"
6490,Mostly good game but for some reason I can't get fps above 100 even though I got 2070 and ryzen 7 3700X

6496,"This is my favourite game! I can't stop playing it, it never gets boring. But it's bad that much hackers are in the game! Almost every competitive game I meet hacker, they even play together. It's so bad! I hope the cheat detector or what's it's called get fixed because these parasites are everywhere!"

6506,GOOD
6507,so gay it make me play
6508,"Its a Free to play game...Its full of hackers. Duh! As for my opinion on the game...its a nice game but the kick and recoil is just too overkill for me and unrealistic and people say that if you can control the recoil you have real skill. I call that Bullschit. Im a real life gun owner and weapons dont fire like that or shoot like that in any way....and thats not skill. Its a game. I wanna shoot things normally. The recoil is terrible on this game. But if you like Asian made games like this that make you grind for months for nothing or Have rediculous recoil and unrealistic weapon mechanics...this game is for you. Its full of hackers and hacking is a big issue on this game. You cant play competitive at level 20 either...its a real grind to get there. Its a phuking shooter!....cmon. Anyway, dont get this game. It sucks and its repetitive besides all of the above stated."
6509,this game is so fun
6510,game is good but devs i dont know so 1diot
6511,THIS GAME IS SO BAD HOW CAN I RUN PUBG AND WARFRAME BUT THIS GAME CLOSES EVERY TIME I PRESS THE PLAY BUTTON
6512,best game ever
6513,"This game should be called ""White Squad"". Me and my streaming group JimHolyGaming on Twitch has been called alot of N words and the top players on this game bringing disrespect and racial slurs to our stream. Black Squad is nothing but hackers and cheaters and they are doing nothing to improve the game. I only still play it to mess with the top players because calling me the N world will not force me to stop playing this game. Do better!"
6514,good game
6515,"One of the worst FPS games I have ever seen.

With the movement style, they try to copy Counter Strike and for the shooting style they went for the most stupid and easy mechanics in the FPS scene. You don't really need to care about recoil, neither should you aim down sights. 

You see someone? Spray them down and hope they die. (No joke, this is one of those games)

It takes absolutely no skill, there are campers in EVERY CORNER and in 90% of your games, there will be spawncamping (either your side or the other). If you are looking for a fun FPS game, this is NOT it, very poorly made and it truly feels like a free game. (there are many other free FPS games that are so much better)

Conclusion: stupidly easy shooting, campers in EVERY lobby and a very bad general atmosphere.

Save your time, you won't enjoy this one."

6583,"~ADD REPORTING SYSTEM IN THE GAME, WHILE IN-GAME AND AFTER THE GAME!~

First, if you are having a problem with servers, just use VPN lmao.

Second, cheaters everywhere, the only mode that is good vs cheaters are knife mode.

Third, make 3 utility not only grenade + smoke/flash. Make it Nade + Smoke + Flash.

Fourth, Familiar with CS:GO overwatch? Where highly skilled players download the short clip of reported players? That will be useful to take down the number of cheaters. I've been playing different kinds of FPS games since 2003, I know a cheater when I see one.

Lastly, I saw someone said that there were trading systems? That would be awesome if you put it back again. 


This is like Point Blank, but 1,000 times better."
6584,"So far it's bellow average experience, because of server allocation like the enemy team(40 ping) has the peak advantage, while my team average 200 ping, oh and the skill base matchmaking is non-existent pair up with veteran player and a very oblivious player(like holy f*ck how bad are you), and some time hit reg is very inconsistent even though i have good ping, yeah i'm very furious with this (how salty are you if you get first shot and the enemy kill you regardless?), they really need to up their game on the servers (that's all it would make a very nice experience overall), i don't care if they implement SBMM (Skill Based Match Making), 

and yeah, i would give this 5/10 if it weren't for the servers

i recommend this game just because it's free"

6591,Good game if you need a quick FPS fix.
6592,fun
6593,Waiting times are insane. Luckily it didnt change so i can still take a huge shit until im waiting for cheaters
6594,"Pro:
-nice and fun gameplay
-good free to play economy, every gun is obtainable through a decent amount of gameplay (except for two guns , that are re-skins of existing guns , the ak12/47 and m4 custom). For new players : there are enough guides out there saying which guns are good / bad. 

Con :
-A lot of hackers , especially in higher levels (even on pro-level) , who just don't get banned , literally.
-They don't add new maps and the ones they do add , are garbage. The only good maps are the old ones.
-The medal shop used to have some nice skins, but they got moved over behind a pay wall ... a VERY big pay wall
-The loot crates have riducilous drop rates , I have opened around 50€ worth of crates over my time in this game (on other accounts) without getting anything worthwhile. So for anyone without a bunch of money to waste: Don't open crates

My conclusion :
The gameplay is fun , but you constantly play against cheaters at the higher end of competitive (lion 3+) and it quite frankly gets annoying if you play against obvious cheaters and ""funny"" players , who dont seem to get banned ever. If you get a clan to play with the game gets a lot better - there are regularly people advertising their clan in the chat. But if you you're new , you're probably better off playing some other game before you get invested too much into this game."
6595,Good Free FPS Game ...
6596,not great but eh its free
6597,PLAY HALF CHETER AUTO AIM  NOT HOU REPORT CHETER/.SIT GAME
6598,Optimized perfectly for a free fps game.

6600,got different skin but if you dont have skill you got easy kill
6601,One of the best free games to play! I had so much fun on this!
6602,the skin is cool and all but they need add mvp system or killcam to  make it more interesting. Also the drop rate is hell xD
6603,very bad
6604,"very good game and nice gameplay
but there is  a problom for some iranian playing this game they need a vpn to play this game"
6605,"This is a pretty good game. There are a few things that could be improved, though. Such as: a kill-cam feature would be nice, the melee system needs to be fixed, ping issues are very prominent, etc. But overall, this is a fantastic game and you should totally get it. It's a pretty competent blend of CS:GO and COD with its gunplay, map design and movement mechanics. I'd love to see more map diversity as well and better and shorter queue times. So yeah.... 8/10 from me."
6606,Really good game just needs a graphics update
6607,just a no from me dawg
6608,nice game and cool graphics

6615,CSGO ripoff but cool a bit
6616,"Cookie cutter FTP FPS that does nothing interesting and locks 90% of content behind lootboxes.
Hitboxes / bullet detection is atrocious too."
6617,"Not actually have Black Squad in-game character.
Not actually black at all.
The in game Shadow is much more Black than White.
IDK tf the game named it self Black .
Have Balanced NATO VS WARSAW PACT ARMS race . Because you always See AR and AK than others users. 
Shotgun users arent that much .
shotgun , Heavy Pistol, Anti-Materials DMR&SR ""with large cal and gauge 12 ""
No Drum megazine at all.
No WW2 & WW1 weapon.

6626,its big ok
6627,"Okay where shall I start hmmmm......
Ah yes the game itself is pretty neat at times but even If my server is set to Europe ping goes over 300 as far as I remember. 
Gameplay is fun but pay to win. 
Originalty of the game is realy 50/50 for an example yes it has many wepons and characters but 50% of the time it feels like a chinese CS:GO.
Even though iit has many cons there are pros and If you are tierd of CS you could try it you can enjoy it without spending a cent in game overall 6.5/10 - Alright but it needs some work
"
6628,fun game to just shoot around
6629,I really liked that it is skill-based and not pay-to-win like most free to play fps games. Feel and quality of the game is really solid and you're able to try many different weapons as you earn medals and game currency.
6630,best game ever
6631,cool game

6662,"The game is good fun but has limited game types. It also feels like there are a good amount of cheaters. Getting headshot the moment you round a corner or being prefired on all the time. A quick google search for hacks for this game shows many types of wall hacks. Just be warned, good games with fair players sometimes feels few and far between."

6682,"I am sorry but this just seems like a regular FPS, although it's F2P that doesn't leave them the excuse to be just as bad as any other free game, I understand making it freeware doesn't give them profit but I guess games aren't made for fun these days.

So I've tried to at least have a match against npcs since there were no players found (even after waiting and even though though they're clearly there on steamdb) but guess what, no npcs joined you're there alone for that too, now explain to me what the f is the point of that if you can't at least practise with the bots themselves, you might as well just remove that (no point of roaming around the map which you can't seem to even simply select)...
Really thanks for proving my point yet again from another free-to-play game to another trash product by a company who didn't give much effort in them game in all honesty making me lose hope for the gaming industry as a whole."

6686,"This game is a disgrace to the market. Its ""positive"" critics don't have a significant meaning, as the game continues to disappoint its players.

- Pay 2 win mechanics (such as the weapons you'll see in the shop, some of the customizations for characters, etc)
- Adding on to previous complaint, it makes the normal weapons and other products in the shop come out to players as an item with less value.
- Hit registration and damage balance between players are godawful. (One player with full health ends up getting one-shotted by an enemy's SMG or anything at all, no matter whoever's stats are)
- Movement and feel of the progression of matches are disgusting to endure.
- Feel of weapons and view of gunplay (including knife animations) are too poor and weak to appeal to players.
- The overall game feels like trash, and people shouldn't be wasting their time on it, over better FPS games. (I'm legit uninstalling this trash afterwards.)
- The developers make players feel like they're lazy at their jobs on trying to at least make the game change or become more fun for JUST A LITTLE BIT, AT LEAST. (In other words = Dumb community that gets random credit, which is confusing, in my opinion)

- (I can make another whole list of problems with Queer Squad, but it'd end up making this review insanely longer than it has to be for you all)

PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, AND GET THIS SIGHT OF THE GAME OFF YOUR LIBRARY. YOU'LL HAVE LESS VALUABLE TO BE TAKEN UP AND ONE LESS ISSUE TO WORRY ABOUT. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

6687,AMAZING GAME...i love it i would recommend everyone play this game..even if u have a potatoe pc/laptop Play IT XD
6688,nc game hmmmm.
6689,"this is a good shooter its a FPS thats on the real life side of shooting if you get shot one to two time,s your dead so you need to be fast but there.s lots of guns to play with for shooter.s of all kinds .....plus they are kind with the prem guns so you dont need to pay to get cool camo guns."
6690,this game is fun but the recoil its so messy ... does not make sense lol
6691,its fun and fast paced cool weapons and not hard to get used to
6692,"Good graphic? You get it
Nice gameplay? sure
p2w? absolutely no
free items? hell yes
hackers? you only saw them in other p2w FPS game
TDM kill spawn? only masochists wants this
ironsight aiming? why not
ridiculous guided missile outta nowhere? we don't do that here

this game is seriously skill based
once your team is just too bad or enemy team is too good, there is no way to comeback the game unless bunch of pros joined the game
steps, reload, changing scope zoom, defusing bomb, attaching suppressor, everything have sound except slow walk
map is kinda ridiculous but other FPS game did that too so no prob
skin is also just show off, no additional stat added (except BSC wep, which you also get it for free)
you get weapons for free (15 days) and from shop for cheap (50k-200k gold)
did I mention free 15k gold everyday? yes

so far, in my 800+ hrs gameplay, only 1 legit hacker I've met with one shot aimbot
other than that, either they are pros (listening to sounds, predicting movement, mapping, etc) or just pure luck

""so what are the cons?""
server matching in quick match is completely random, sometimes at EU server, sometimes at SEA, sometimes at NA, and so on
lacks map in unique mode Assassination (ONLY 3 MAPS WTF DUDE)
room master in custom mode can easily go afk by going to inventory viewer without worried being kicked out from room
no spectator mode"

6732,Good game but not perfect. Players shouldn't get penalty for leaving match full of hackers in comp. It's a pain in the ass to to wait 10 min and play  5 games after. Maybe voting system ingame ? but then again people might abuse it. It a fun game but not perfect. I still recommended though <3 a lot of fun :D

6747,"First person shooter with different play style options, varied weapon choices depending on in game currency type used, including the purchasing of daily, weekly or monthly grenade and smoke options. Several maps chosen at random when enough players have gathered in the room. usually a good mix of skill in the matches but have been on both sides of complete domination and even going against several opponents solo as players either exited the match or did not move like a glitch or bot account. 
overall good experience and would recommend"

6818,This WAS a great game. Just way to many cheaters now.
6819,"First of all, the game has great graphics, and if you are a person who doesn't have much money to spare, the game is free, you can obtain everything in the game without paying money, (if you try hard enough) and the game can adjust to about any kind of computer without lag if you perfect the settings. If you're squeamish or faint-hearted, the game doesn't feature much blood. Community is nice, map design is optimal, and everything is balanced to the right proportions. The tutorial gives lots of information in a neat way so it's easy to remember. You can change the controls to just about anything, and the game is bite-sized but still is lots of fun in multiplayer.

tldr: The game is a free-to-play, no-need-to pay-money-version of CS:GO."

6895,It is really really good. my team members are really enjoying this game.
6896,"A fun and thrilling FPS multiplayer game, offers a great variety of modes and weapons to play with. It certainly has the potential to grow. However, at times there is long waiting time for less popular game modes, likely due to the small player base compared to the popular ones like CS:GO. Another gripe is the huge amount of credits required to get any decent cosmetic skins in-game, while you will earn only measly amount per game. There is even an exclusively paid currency known as bullet. The credit rewards get marginally better however during seasonal events such as during Christmas."

6910,"First of all, the server locations are random, you never know if you will play in US or EU servers.
Communication between you and your teammates never happens (even in competitive).
Community is more toxic than CSGO community (I haven't had a single game without someone saying ""EZ noobs"".
If you don't know Russian don't even try to type in global chat (In all of my games there were atleast 6-8 Russians in each game)
Oh yeah also i forgot about cheaters,they are like ants millions of them.

This is all from my personal experience with the game it might have been diffrent with you."

2. this game must have an ingame report system.

3. the creators of the game only care about their money and their skins and they dont care for the people
who scream for help.

4. the game has so many bugs including the unreg of the headshot, the headshot never registers

6925,"Sometimes game is launching in 5 minutes.
I think developers dont know anything about borderless window mode for games.Because my desktop resolution is 1920 1080.It has to be only 1 choice in game for borderless window options,that would be my desktops resolution.But however it has all resolutions options including 1920 1080.It doesnt work right and it slow down the game.
When you make 0 sound in settings game is become unplayeble or fps drops.
Weapons damage and handling systems are shi tty.2 weapon have same stat at damage like 36.But one of them making 70 damage to head other one making 68.About handling system.In stats comparing 2 weapons.One of them have better stability and accuracy.This better weapon recoils and spreads more then the bad stat weapon.
About damage one more example.Ak47 have 48 damage, Aek973 have 49 damage.While silencer is on these two weapons if you headshot enemy both weapons gonna make 99 damage.

Also, about 6 months ago a lot of maps seem to have disappeared from rotation. Whenever I now play it's the same 8 or so maps. Devs are denying the removal but my gameplay experience says something different."

AND WHEN THEY EZ EZ I REALLY WANT TO PUNCH THEM IN THE FACE. and so many hackers like i meet hackers almost everyday in custom matches so u can think about competitive.because of these hackers which are so many, devs are banning every dude who is playing little nice, like my only friend  i play with bachy.hangvu who played this game for like 5 years! WHAT 5  YEARS YES THATS A LOT MAN, got ban of hacking. i was so hurt man, and the day  he got banned i met like 5 hackers in sniper mode only _+_. devs are banning hackers who THEY think are hacking not the actual hackers.
THIS GAME THO HAVE ONE NICE THING THAT ITS FREE NOTHING ELSE, 


I GOT ONE ADVICE FOR YOU AFTER PLAYING THIS GAME A LITTLE ONLY PLAY THIS GAME IF U HAVE PLAYED EVERY SINGLE GAME ON THIS PLANET AND THIS IS THE ONLY GAME LEFT TO PLAY. I PLAY SOMETIMES I KNOW SHOULD NOT BUT I AM STILL WATING MAYBE THEY WILL UNBAN MY FRIEND."

There are different modes to play like deathmatch or bombscenario like in other games like csgo for example. You can of course play with your friends. Overall its great fun and a great game. If you have already some experience with fps games and teams you can also climb ranks the competitive mode quite fast because the playerbase isnt as big and skilled like in other fps games."

6966,ok

dying game, people leaving cause every match they get a hacker.
played this game for so much time and it was fun, but latly there is not a single match without a hacker.
you cant report it because no one care.
sent videos with hackers aiming at walls and doing 5 headshots in a row to 5 members in a round but not a single ban.
STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

edit: 2021 still full of hackers, still hard to find a match, still people who wanna lower their rank to find easier games throw the match and lose.
the advice is still relevant - STAY AWAY"

Also the custom game settings actually dog shit, me and my friends can only play ""sniper/shotgun only mode"" in only a few maps. The map location names is also dog shit lazy writing name, there's no ""window"" or ""double door"", only 1,2,3 etc.

like imagine you die and want to give info to your teammate, but you can only say ""cb there's 1 at location 4"".  like cb pls -_-"

7031,"90 days season rewards instead of permanent.  What a joke.  Which dev thought that was a good idea?

Steam market is gone.  ??? Skin prices increased.  No more grinding to get BS coins from free events.  Game has obviously turned into a cash grab before itll get shut down from lack of interest.

The actual ""bugs"" with the game are not very bad at all.  Everyone whines to fix ""no reg"" when all it is is a ping difference between you and the enemy player.  You only get ""no regs"" when above 100 ping.  Since so many people play this game on not quickmatch mode it ques them in servers with 300 ping and they whine and bitch when they're just dumb.  

Game mechanics are really nice actually, and maps are tolerable, if you're patient.

Comp play is fun but there are indeed boosters that pay for rank which is dumb.  
There are a few hackers, but from what ive seen they get banned rather quickly.

There is a very VERY high skill cap and if someone is destroying you its usually just because they are better.

Recently updated my review and now want to downvote this game twice if i could just because of 90 day skins from comp season instead of perm."

Its supposed to be for breaching a room so it should blind anyone that's looking at it I think. I also have trouble getting into clans but thats probably because I am bad at the game. Otherwise I love the game love the variety of weapons, its not pay to win and very competitive."
7070,great game
7071,cool
7072,I like how funny this game but some maps need to be edited!
7073,"Mostly false players and hackers are involved in this game, This game is not recommended because of this, The creators of this game probably dont care about cheaters and hackers messing up there work.
The game itself is nicely set up and has fantastic graphics, only cheaters and hackers ruin the atmosphere in the game.
I am thinking about removing the game myself if my brother would not play the game.
A shame because it really had potential"
7074,ok
7075,"gud

7076,good
7077,great free game. think its good to get you into PC shooting games
7078,You can't complain after getting free skin.
7079,"its awesome
"
7080,"This game is trash.  White hot molten trash.  All the ingredients for a good shooter are there.  Lots of guns, cool skins, varied maps, lots of modes, plenty of nubs to slaughter (who will often leave you mindblown at how someone could possibly be THAT bad at a game).  But three key things ruin it completely.

Server allocation.
Hitreg.
Cheaters.

Server allocation is random and constantly mixes EU and US players.  You might think ""oh well the population is low so even though it's not ideal, it's necessary so people can get matches.  Surely it's not random.  No modern fps game designer would botch it that bad right?

NO.  WRONG.  IT.  IS.  RANDOM!!!    As in there is no algorithm that even tries to allocate players to an optimal server based on region/ping.  I have played multiple COMPETITIVE 5v5 matches where 10 US players were placed on an EU server MULTIPLE TIMES with not a single person below 110 ping.  Check my public screenshots for proof.

Partially due to ping discrepancies, and partially due to just bad netcode; hitreg is terrible as well.  You will find yourself pouring half a mag directly into someone's chest at 15 feet (maybe with a headshot crunch or two in there somewhere) before dying, then see someone else kill them, and not even get an assist.  Hard hitting guns can 1 shot if you get a headshot (allegedly).  This would be nice if spraying a dozen bullets into someone's face didn't frequently register as shoulder/body shots, if it even registers at all.  To make it worse, audio effects are all client-side, so you'll often hear the crunch sound of a headshot (or frequently multiple headshots even though you're using a gun that supposedly 1 shots in the head), or the crunch sound of a kill, and stop firing only to find that they didn't die, they're still shooting you, and now you're going to die.  Basically hitreg is a joke and aiming barely matters.  So on to my next point: to overcome the terrible matchmaking and hitreg, a lot of people CHEAT.  But wait there's battleye right?  lol.  no.

There is NO ANTICHEAT.  They run an unconfigured version of battleye that rarely kicks people (not bans, just kicks and they can immediately rejoin the match) for random things (i've seen someone get kicked from a match for accidentally pressing the Windows menu key).  Meanwhile blatant wallhacks, aimbots, triggerbots, etc. are everywhere.  and i mean EVERYWHERE.  Blatant wallhackers and aimbotters are a daily encounter if you play this game.  Now, there are a LOT of idiots who play this game and accuse literally anyone with any gamesense and aiming ability (or just bad ping making their peekers advantage outrageous) of hacking, and those people mostly just need to learn to play.  But when you play competitive, especially in the higher tiers, there are in fact a TON of people cheating, who never get banned, and some matches boil down to whether the tool who's cheating on your team can cheat harder than the tool who's cheating on the other team.  Everyone else who's legit just tries to find corners they can best abuse their ping on for the most peeker's advantage, and then sprays and prays at shoulder height hoping the hitreg gods give them a kill this time.

Of course not EVERY match has a cheater, and SOMETIMES hitreg works (though literally every match has at least one displaced 100+ ping player in it.  That matchmaking/server allocation really is an abortion), and sometimes it can approach the point of actually being fun.  But mostly it's just a progression grind where earning meaningless things keeps you playing a game that stopped being fun 5 minutes after you got on.

Please look at all of the positive reviews below this one and take a wild guess whether that bot  account with a handful of hours played who said ""great game"" to bump this mess up to ""mostly positive"" was legit.

Edit:
The dev/mod team DO NOT CARE about your game experience.  They do not care that you are consistently thrown into servers where you have 150+ ping that the garbage netcode can't handle.  They do not care that 90% of your lion+ comp matches have a wallhack/aimbot in them who is magically cobra this season after being eagle last season, or a cobra who never played a season and has a 5kd while also being barely high enough rank to even play competitive, or about the prefire headshot through smoke (but i'm sure that's totally legit) deaths you legit lion/cobra ranked players have all experieneced in compeititive this last month and a half. While their astroturfer (look it up) army of players with a handful of hours played continue to say ""great game"" and keep the review score at ""mostly positive"" to attract new sheep who might drop a dollar on a skin before quitting.  

As someone who has been around for a while, WAKE THE F*CK UP guys.  The new ""mod"" team they hired has started locking/banning/warning any posts that even mention how bad the competitive cheater problem is right now, claiming ""illicit/illegal content"" as the justification for the warning/ban -- for something as simple as just saying ""yeah, comp has been unplayable since the xmas update dropped."" Something that basic can get you warned/banned. Mods are claiming comp is totally clean right now while simultaneously purging the discussion boards of any mention of the ongoing cheating in competitive

The really sad thing is this game is solid from a mechanics and design standpoint.  But the devs/mods have made it clear that they don't care about the integrity of the game, and only want to scam naive new players out of money at this point. 

Do not expect the game to get cleaned up or better ever.  And for god's sake don't give these fraud's any money.

As of Jan 1 2020, 14 of my last 18 competitive matches at lion/cobra level have had someone blatantly cheating.  The decision by devs/mods to start handing out bs warnings and bans to anyone talking about it on the forums now has proved to me that i'm wasting my time hoping for a banwave or any sort of acknowledgment or fix.  Move along, and don't waste your time on this game."

7088,noice
7089,"Good game, good support."
7090,"I like it because it provides lots of fun without requiring much focus on learning and practicing the game.

It has both CoD and CSGO look and feel in a different package.
Plus all the new fangled stuff like coins, micro transactions, skins etc which I don't care much.

What I don't like, is that there is nothing more to do once you learn the basic mechanics. You hit the skill level cap pretty fast and then it becomes repetitive.
Still, I like the game overall. In spare time joining for some brainless TDM to chill.
"
7091,"had potential but game is mostly dead, one update per 4 months with new skins thats all. Couldve been the second coming of combat arms and maybe a smaller pro league but instead its just a trash matchmaking with only a few veterans who dont have anything better to play. game has potential but community dead"
7092,Decent game. Small in size. Not bad if you want to have a little fun.
7093,Not bad. BUT.....not bad
7094,It's Amazing in every way
7095,"Good graphics and nice gameplay but the support team is real bad...
I have been banned permanently for being a hacker which i not am.
I just played like a pro and they told me they have proof of evidence that show me that i am a hacker...
Never seen such stupid support in my entire life.
I didn't even had a chance to explain and to proof that i am not a hacker...
So no i don't recommend this game because the chance to be banned forever is like 100%
Even when your trolling and say in gamechat for fun: yes i am a hacker 
That's what i did and that's why i got banned but i dont' care anymore..
I play much better games right now and which the support team is very helpful and friendly
And yes what do you expect from a free game? I suggest go buy a shooter game.
Seriously that is my advice if you don't want to meet a bad support team like me..."

[+] Regular release of seasonal events are the things to look forward to the most with this game, especially the winter events.
[-] Random crashes mid-game and unannounced ""maintenance"" are the only drawbacks in my opinion but usually logging back into the game is fairly quick."
7098,Play CSGO instead.
7099,this game is bad
7100,"This game is really good, a darker grittier open-world game with a central character you actually care about and a city full of hidden gems and all sorts of fun to be had. Gameplay is excellent with simple controls that are easy to learn and shoot-outs with gangs are a lot of fun as you can hack into the cctv cameras and force objects to explode and kill your enemies from a far. Vehicle are handled well and are easy to drive, and I found it especially enjoyable to take down vehicles using the traffic lights, although this didn't happen a lot for me. The slow motion cut scene when you pulled it off is excellent.

The missions are varied and offer a lot of challenges. There were a couple of missions that took me a long time to complete and it wasn't because of a poorly made game, it was just that the right tactics needed to be employed to achieve success. I wasn't frustrated or anything I just wanted to finish the mission to see what was around the corner.

This game can be had for dirt cheap because it is a year old, and offers great value for money with plenty of missions and side quests to keep you hooked."
7101,this game is awesome for me..they need only to allow people something simple to add friends and something similar..
7102,"typical tactical first person shooter, more bombs less sniping in this one"
7103,DAWDAWD
7104,"One the best game ever played 
"
7105,"First of all, and this is probably one of the most important points for f2f game nowadays:
THIS IS NOT IN ANY WAY OR SHAPE A PAY TO WIN GAME!

now that we got that out of the way lets processed to talkin about the game itself - its fun.
It is extremely fun, i love mostly everything about it - the ingame sound and audio feedback is amazing and visceral (except the music in the main menu, that shits annoying af) the gun play is just... its.... incredible. 
The variety of guns is huge and each gun actually feels different unlike other FPS games they all have their little ""quirks and personalities"" you need to get used to and the balance is fairly decent even though some of the choices are abit.. uncoventional for this genere.

only bad things i can speak of are the graphics, they are fairly dated but aint that horrible to look at.
And the cheaters, ohhh the cheaters, there is no vote option or report fuction so if ur stuck with one you gotta leave the game, to be fair in my 6 hours of gameplay i have only encountered 2 obvious cheater (aimbots) but im fairly certain they were afew wallhackers here and there.
which bring me to my last complaint - the player base, its small. not small enough to take hours upon hours to find a game but small enough to start seeing the same people playing constantly.

overall a good game, 9/11 would recommend, download try and pew pew."

Many guns in the game are useless compared to others, but the guns that are useful are all balanced. The only drawback of this game I've seen is the anti-cheat and lack of large updates, the core gameplay makes up for the lack of updates since it's fun and still is fun 100+ hours later. Definitely a good game to play."

7194,"I must say that this game was really good back in 2017, i played this game pretty much a year and hadn't got bored because updates were awesome. I have a lot of fun and crazy moments. This game is prefect for killing time.

But sadly the dev is just ignore the game and cheater is still in competitive and casual mode. Report system is really bad and i can not believe that these monors still cheating while dev is just add skins and skins. I don't mind about skin but each update is pretty much skins and skins which no one cares about it. It has been 2 years that the dev still add skins and skins

Let's talk about cheater. These monors, brain deads are always ruining the casual and competitive mode. If you think I am wrong, then fk u and keep blaming. This game has a lot of potential of getting rid of these stupid cheater but dev is still drunk and in love with ""SKINS"", this game is just like CSGO with awful cs and vac-net. 

About update, after 2018 these updates were always ""SKINS"" and awful comestic. It just make this game looks worse and felt like it is basically anime FPS game ( Rena is a perfect example of this ). And yes ""SKINS"" are everywhere in Dead Squad, it is only way to keep this game alive right? The answer is a big ""NO"" . Adding new weapons is only thing that I actually like it, you can buy it in in-games with medal.

The microtransaction was garbage and the price was too expensive, loot boxes are dumb and some of the skins are untradeable and unmarketable. Steam market is just a bunch of retard putting trash skin and sell it with ridicious prices. Who ever do that must be autistic kid with no brain.

Its been 2 years that they dont care anymore about the game, they cant even realize how much potential casual/competitive BS have.. they keep giving us next skins since day one and lets not speak about the fact that BE Is not working.

My 1000hrs right now is just a waste and you better go play another fps game. This 
game is offically #DEADSQUAD -> FOR DEV IF U READ MY REVIEW FK U AND PUT UR SKIN INTO UR MOM PUSSY  !!!"

What can I say, because the wave of cheaters in season two, I gave up season 3, I entered season 4 literally for the last week, and then decided that I would try to play in season 5.

Reading the beautiful DEV & medics posts about how they fight with cheaters, I began to wonder - maybe they actually started to fight cheaters? Nothing could be more wrong.

Today, again, player with new account (his teammates are lion I and cobra III who literally play as trash) make jump-shots with revolver from half of the map - 1 shot - 1 critical headshot.

I already provided video for support, but this is my last time I do this.
Its boring guys, report system which people asking since very long time - still didnt show up, you decrease cheaters? Yeah - only in mareting materials ...

Cóż mogę powiedzieć, po fali cheaterów w sezonie drugim, odpuściłem sobie sezon 3, wszedłem na sezon 4 dosłownie na ostatni tydzień, a następnie stwierdziłem, że spróbuję pograć w sezonie 5. 

Czytując piękne posty DEV & medics o tym jak walczą z cheaterami, zacząłem się zastanawiać -- może faktycznie wzięli się do walki z oszustami? Nic bardziej mylnego. 

Dziś znów - gracz z nowym kontem (boostując dwa gówna cobra III i lion I )  strzela headshoty z połowy mapy w skoku

Video wysłałem do supportu, ale to ostatni raz - bo i tak nic z tym nie zrobią.

7388,"It has shooting. And boxes that dont require keys. Also, 90% of people are bots. Like me. If CSGO has hurt you, come on down to Black Squad. Here is a few tips to get you started: hold shift to walk. Its very useful; You still have decent accuracy even while jumping; Make sure you grab some friends and/or acquaintances to join with you.

7463,"In case you are on the fence or just want a perspective of someone who's been playing a bit, here's a review I just left on Steam for Black Squad -- let me know if you think I missed anything!

As someone who is generally skeptical of free-to-play titles, particularly with FPS games, I am shocked at what I've stumbled upon here with Black Squad.

I've been playing FPS games on PC and console for sixteen years and let me tell you, the netcode and hit registration in this game is no joke. It makes CSGO, Battlefield, and CoD netcodes seem like they were hacked together by middle school children; considering the budget difference it’s actually quite embarrassing for the bigger publishers. This is coming from someone who is a long-time Battlefield and Counter-Strike player (and occasionally CoD fan, particularly pre-2010 titles).

Netcode is undoubtedly the most important underlying factor for a shooter, but there's a lot more this game does correctly:

All weapons unlockable without any premium / monetary investment

Premium weapons are literally stock weapons with skins. Zero statistical advantage.

So now that we know the game has a solid foundation, let’s get into details:

Starting weapons shred people, so you are golden from the moment you begin your first game

No automatic health regen

Multiple classes, each with their own killstreaks (4 per class)

Killstreaks (which are obtainable with objective points as well) are reasonable, similar to what you saw in CoD 4

If you have good muscle memory and decision making, you will not lose a firefight unless it is entirely your fault

Black Squad's game modes are a great deal a fun, and they put together a well-rounded list of options. There's classic TDM, VIP, and Demolition (5v5 and 8v8), however I'm currently gravitating toward Battle Match (16 v 16) which features multiple objectives that need to be destroyed by both sides.

Maps are comparable to current AAA titles -- there's long stretches for snipers, close quarters for runners, and generally an assault rifle or carbine will serve as your adaptable option. You have three class kits to customize, so you can easily adapt to the circumstances of your game.

There are three live currencies:

Gold (Purchases 14-day items. Earned through many general tasks/games/achievements/etc.)

Medals (Purchases permanent weapons. Earned through more difficult challenges.)

BS Coin (Purchases cosmetic variants of weapons)

Overall I'm surprised to see myself get slightly addicted to this game. Did I mention the netcode was (nearly) perfect? ;)

Considering it's free, this game is worth your time and effort to try. Really hope the developers stick to this formula and just add more maps. Everything else is great."

With developer support being nonexistant and wait times of 15 minutes for a 2 minuet game, I believe that this game has the potential as a nominee for game of the year!! I just love the expiriance of a whole team of russians yelling into their mics for the whole game, only to have the game stop working for days at a time! I have 17351937 hours played, and am still enjoying the 4 minuets of innovative gameplay that this work of art has to offer! Would recomend"

Black squad is one of these generic call of duty inspired first person shooters.

pros:
-game is free
-has different primary firearms
-free version of call of duty

cons:
-has some pay-ish to win options, HE grenades, smokes, flashbangs, all cost a lot of money, and only last for a day, players who buy HE grenades and smokes everyday will have a straight advantage, because people who don't want to invest points into nades will have no nades
-the game offers some cosmetic skin options, they have around 4 female skins, all at the same price, and 2 other normal skins that can be bought with ''bullets'', however, it seems that bullets can be only bought with real money, a skin costs around 1750 bullets, 80 bullets cost around 1$, you have to pay around 15 dollars, just for one cosmetic skin, grantend, the more bullets you buy, the more value you get out of them, the game does have 3 other skins, which can be bought with medals, but those are very grindy
-lack of secondary weapon options
-lack of melee options

if you like semi-tactical fast paced shooters and have a decentish compueter i would recommend trying it
the diffrent shop systems and events is kinda hard to get used to but it works
a little P2W, but not much, mostly skins for weapons you can unlock with 1-2 hours of gameplay, and skipping that is so little compared to other titles"

Thank you for your attention.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A good combination of CS:GO and A.V.A in an easier, player friendly kind of way.

Definitely a good Free2Play game without Pay2Win factor. Ofc you can buy weapon skins for real money and some of the ingame weapons need some playtime to unlock, but all in all you can have the same exact base weapon inventory by playing without paying money.

Very nice FPS in terms of Free2Play Shooters!"

7890,A fun little Shooter that combines quick movements and sharp teamplay. Very fun with friends.
7891,"Game is good, fast paced to keep your reaction running unlike other games, a bit pay-to-win (yes, some weapons can only be bought with bullets, medals as well). However, their loot cases are no other, its perfectly good because it drops the item you want recently if you keep opening the same case. But -> recoil is a bit weird, needs new game modes because its getting old, needs new songs (its getting old)."

Its just some bootleg between Cs Go and CoD ( mostly Cs Go ) except its Free..nothing new at all

8070,"Call of Duty mixed with Counter Strike.

A huuuuge variety of weapons to chosse from, with each one having atleast one alt skin. All weapons( Primary, secondary and melee) can be bought with ingame currency. No P2W.
It also has seasonal events that reward you with temporary and permanent weapon skins.
The Gunplay feels very COD-like with enemy encounters usually ending pretty quickly.
My biggest complaint is the lack of map variety. at first it's okay, but later on you just wish there were more maps. But since the game is being actively updated, that probably won't be a problem for too long."

8258,"I mean, its a shooter so you either like it, or don't."
8259,"Its a shit game. There is 0 possiblility for recoil controll, its literally random patterens every single time and nothinmmg that seems to be even close to the same. All guins are random as fuck and snipeing is inaccurate as fuck unless ur not moveing and standing 100% still like a bot, meanwhile not all snipers 1hit. Even some of the bolt action snipers (the heavy ones) can do like 97, 98, 99 dmg instead of 1hit."
8260,"this is a fun game and there's always a server with players in it....the maps are a bit small, but that makes them easy to get familiar with..it lags a bit, but it doesn't take any of the fun away...if you don't pay money, like some players do, you won't have all the powerful weapons that some have...i really like the different modes of play...destruction and team death matches are my favorites...awesome game for a freebie"

8298,Decent FPS especially for free to play.  It's a mix of Cod style fighting with CS:GO like mechanics.  most of the  TDM maps are pretty terrible though so expect to be in sight of 5+ angles at most times.

8312,This game was one of the best games i have ever played until the no reg shots started since the last 2 updates i cant even play tdm anymore and its just getting worse
8313,was fun really need to add and in game report function though and some new assasination maps cause it get boring after a while also the currency is hard to get unless u do a quickmatch or a competitive match which in some regions takes ages to get
8314,"Fun game-play, sound effects, game mechanics 

But , getting weapons is either grind or pay-to-get  and the Ui is cancer.
its a side game for me , after being bored from csgo.
its like if csgo and cod had a baby with shit UI"
8315,Very FUN game good graphic. ;) Playyy!!!
8316,Has good game modes and only real complaint i had was that it needs a better reporting system

8324,cool but no matchmaking
8325,"Fun game, but I honestly have never seen worse ping. You're lucky to get below 100, and even then, you'll rubber band all over the place. Don't bother strafing back and forth, you'll just end up teleporting 5 feet away from where you think you are."
8326,"Way better than CS-GO! One of the best FPS games out there, just an amazing games with a amazing skins, although I do wish the crate keys could be bought"
8327,"I absolutely love this game. If I'm having a bad day, I can go to black squad. Having a good day, black squad. It's a good game for whatever  mood I'm in.

Edit: Weapons can no longer be sold on market for money. That's how I used to buy bullets. The boxes are worthless unless you have bullets to buy the premium boxes. If you play for a long time or are decent at the game, you get called hacker or cheater and reported by people who even though they have more hours, don't do as well."
8328,"Matchmaking is very bad,, no balanced in game.. on hit for body,, come on this really game.. -_-!!"

8350,FPS DOWN ALL THE TIME~!
8351,"Game is Fun and also Free.

The game consists of micro transactions however that being said it doesn't feel pay to win and many weapons are available and you can get them relatively easily. Also the sound effects are pretty neat, the game has a good player base and killing someone in this game definitely feels satisfying. I would definitely recommend this game to all FPS lovers out there."

8377,"Although TTK is extraordinarily low, so much so that even the best of players in a server have 6+ deaths, the kills and guns feel amazingly satisfying.  The generous credit system allows you to buy weapons of any tier, and all weapons have their uses.  Overall, learning the maps and guns makes the game infinitely more satisfying, and with it being free to play, I really see very few problems; although, some fights can feel cheap, especially when you shoot first, yet the enemy gets the kill."
8378,awesome game
8379,to be honest its a csgo style game but i personally find it better
8380,Better than any other FPS game atm.

It's not as bad a cash grab as CS:GO"
8395,"The game itself is really awesome, but matchmaking is the crappiest I've ever seen. You are too often matched with people where the opponents are ALL far higher than your own teammates. 

For Example:

My Team: Eagle 3, Eagle 3, Wolf 1, Eagle 2 and Eagle 1
Enemy Team: Lion 1, Lion 2, Cobra 3, Eagle 1 and Eagle 1

(MMR points difference = 200-300)


Ranks:

Wolf 3
Wolf 2
Wolf 1

after Wolf...

Eagle 3
Eagle 2
Eagle 1

after Eagle...

Lion 3

After all, yes I recommend this game, go guys and play it:)"

8483,"free2play, not p2w"
8484,Hmm Mabar
8485,"Positive: Great shooter, all perfect, right click for accuracy is a great thing that put this game one step ahead of CS.
Negative: No stopping effect for bullets when you shot the enemy, everyone is moving super fast and there is no physics that wold stop from pressing A(left) and D(right) when shooting.
Conclusion: I wold like it more than CS if they wold fix that but I think all A and D players will get sad."

8515,"Good game, if you got a 5 friends to play with go for it"
8516,Oko
8517,"A fun, simple diversion from CSGO. Have you ever wondered how CS would play if there was no moving inaccuracy? Well, here's Black Squad. TDM mode is pretty much just clicking on heads and if you're feeling for an actual competition, there's the all too familiar defusal mode, which is extremely similar to CS' own defusal mode, but it seriously lacks the polish that it has. 

For me, I don't need a lot of content to have fun in a shooter. At it's core, Black Squad nothing but a shooter where you're rewarded for precision, being bold and none of that pansy killstreaks... okay, I lied, there's a mode where that's enabled. I think it's called Capture? That mode is honestly kind of relaxing in such an aim intense game. 

Anyways, if you want a wacky CS-clone that pretty much yeets out the whole entire inaccuracy mechanic, check this out. Be warned though, the maps in this game sucks butt.
-

If you want to get started... 

Unfortunately, the game has like four different currencies and shit gets confusing FAST. 

Gold: Free currency
Bullets: You can only get this from paying for this SPECIFICALLY
BS Coin: You get this from random level-up rewards & crates that you pay *real* money for.
Medals: Currency that you can get from leveling up, crates and login rewards.

Get the free DLC packs, it gives you a bunch of guns to try out.  

(Big fat optional section if you want more guns) If you want, scrounge up .99 cents from selling your garbage CSGO skins on the market and purchase the 1.2k bullet pack which is a one time deal per acc. Buy the medal supply crate from the store with your bullets. THIS IS OPTIONAL. YOU DO NOT NEED TO SPEND A SINGLE PENNY FOR BLACK SQUAD! YOU GET A TON OF MEDALS FOR LEVELING UP & DAILY REWARDS.

Guns I recommend are: 

Assault Rifles -

AK12, AK47 (Literally the same gun, the AK47 just has really bad irons, but you're a 1.6 OG-boomer hipfire god with it)
M4, M4A1 (Almost the same gun, but thanks to power creep the M4A1 has better spread & recoil with one more unit of dmg, it only has irons tho)
R5, ACR, MDR (Laser guns. The nice thing about the R5 is that it's obtainable with free currency)
Type95 (Chonky bastard with chonky damage. Very similar to the AK guns in terms of damage. Free currency!)

Snipers -

Blaser, DSR-1, M40A5, MSR"
8518,a pretty annoying problem is that you can't report it to a player because he has cheet or vote to kick for afk..or other reasons
8519,"this is good game low kids low russin its only this game
"
8520,"Fun game if you're not facing hackers lol. But the hackers in this game is not that much compared to other competitive games
Controls are easy enough but the hit registration is kinda wack. I hit someone with scar-h 5 times on his chest and he still survived and killed me, even I and him have the same ping (20ms, not great but still playable)
Oh and the battle mode like, destroy? That's my favorite, and capture mode give me a battlefield vibes, but you'll be lucky if u can find them in the custom match because all players are mostly playing with bots lmao"

8526,"typical korean fps, starts off with a good premise. then becomes pay for skins and pay to win.

shame cause some of the modes are pretty interesting, but they choose to pander to the post teen weeb crowd.

Just flawless, I also enjoy this game cuz there is fun, u can nade people in many ways, you can even try to ninja defuse, idk I just love this game, I just dont like turk/iran community, but well at least u can fuck them and u wont get ban for this, so anyway its still better than league of legends when u can get ban for single typing noob to some idiot ;D"

8557,"I see this game as a really simple first person shooter. All you have to do is run and gun, no real objectives, just you and a gun that shoots where you want it to shoot and don't have to grind for years to get a different one. Competetive mode is included ( nothing special about it, just go plant the bomb or kill the opposite team). Graphics might not be the best, game might not run as well as it should (considering how it looks) but all in all a really pleasant experience. Just get in some match and enjoy fast, simple and enjoyable gameplay that is good even for casual players."
8558,"if you like a fast game, quick loading screens an realistic gun battles then I'd recemmend this game for you..

8590,"yea... This game ""seems"" like it would be fun, but i spent 2 hours getting INSTANTLY headshot, through walls, through objects, with NO line of sight, from players on OTHER SIDE OF MAP.. 

Not sure what ""anti-cheat"" software they are using, but it's either not implimented correctly, or it's not being updated, because the amount of cheats, aim bots, location highlighters available are rediculous. 

Literally the MOST cheated game"

Then there is the false positives from Battle Eye that wont get you banned but can disrupt your game play.
So as much as I like this game I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as the Devs do not clean out the cheaters."

8691,"A genuine game but..

The servers are full of hackers, players with a 100+ ping or toxic kids.
The developers don't do a damn thing to change anything to ban them. The report system is so cumbersome that you can also do a tax return.
The latest silly thing is that they removed the kill counters in the random game, yeah a shooter without a kill counter is awesome."
8692,As a player on this game I feel so frustrated that despite cheat preventive software being present (Battle eye) there still lurks a huge amount of cheating players that have discovered hacking files called trainers that enable the player to become a God in their own right. The trainers obviously have been created by the team members of the game to generate a fee for players to enable them to by pass the preventive software and basically annoy non-hacking players like myself. Therefore Battle eye being a joke in its form to stop weak  and incapable pundits paying to win and completely making players angry. So unless you are a individual that has to pay to win to enjoy beating people with skill so to speak I would recommend not installing this game that speaks volumes about investing to be entertained as a skilless egotistical person with a major disability

8737,"Incompetent community managers (Neobricks) fail to communicate proper community feedback to the developers of the game and therefore they are fine with increasing monetization over responding to the community suffering from bugs that have existed since the day of release. Updates mostly include event skins and cosmetics over worthwhile game features such as more customisation to weapons (a feature that has been requested since the controversial AK ZHUKOV GL launch in early Q3 of 2018). A major bug that has been completely ignored by the developers despite many in the community bringing up the issue in countless social media comments, Discord etc. is NO REGS (failure of ""client event"" registration to the server). In simpler terms, you will shoot an enemy in the head with a one-shot headshot weapon such as the AK-47 for example and the enemy's blood will splatter from their head, and onto the walls closest to that enemy and the bullet won't register on the server, you get killed instead and notice that the enemy hasn't taken a single point of damage in the exchange that you witness many, many times in this game. DO NOT TRY THIS GAME or the developers see an increase in player numbers and therefore think all is fine with this game. NO REGS is the biggest frustration of this game and it is KNOWN by the community managers and they indirectly call their community a bunch of liars for reporting the bug that in their eyes does not exist. Higher ping players will suffer the most from this issue. Do not install. (at the time of writing this review, I have stopped playing for 3 months and will continue to do so for the rest of my life) I refuse to subject myself to constant no regs (at least 5 - 10 no regs per 5v5 Demolition - Bomb Defusal match). Go play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive instead."

8771,"Obvious budget CS-GO clone with low end graphics (works ok for lower end PC's i guess). Gun mechanics seem ok, sound is pretty meaty but the game just lacks something.
The main menu and UI is a complete mess and navigating around is not easy. Gameplay is same ol' TDM Military Vs Terrorist format. A mix of in-game currency items and real world cash stuff but nothing amazingly ground breaking or really interesting for that matter. Maps are not balanced/tested well and there's spawn camping exploits in some. 

BIG down side is anti-cheat seems quite weak, you can go a few matches without a hacker but pretty much most are using ESP... you can fake jumping out of a corner and bait them to pre-fire 'til the days end... try it. Also, the occasional aim-botter. (No kill cam or obvious reporting system - so no punishment for using them?... Don't know!)

There's many other options out there for F2P shooters, I recommend one of them before Black Squad."
8772,no pay to win
8773,"AutoBalance Team is Suckss , Patience needed"
8774,It's fun. I suck at it :) But still fun to play.
8775,"Game is Fun , Once you find the weapon that suit you that is. Plus I've Played CS:GO recently as well so maybe that would explain my change of view of these type of FPS games . but yeah I like it the only thing that sucks is certain characters are EVENT characters so a good majority of things are like 3 days limit type stuff but yeah other then that it's gucci."
8776,Good gameeeeeeee
8777,it's ok.
8778,First and foremost - it's an odd game. Just bizzare. Who wanted it and why. I can't figure out how to change the aiming from toggle to hold. It also only displays at 1080p on my ultrawide monitor which is frustrating as it stretches out the image. It is a strange mix between CoD and CS:GO.
8779,nice
8780,Nice game
8781,Game như l
8782,Used to play it long ago but now its become P2W just f off already :D
8783,"If you dis/like counter Strike and want an easier more fun game where all guns have ~0 recoil when hipfired then this is the game for you!

It's a first person shooter with Demolition, TDM, a random game mode, and toxicity (because every FPS is a toxic sespool until proven otherwise). With a lot of weapons in two variations: w/ Grenade Launcher and W/o Grenade launcher. The game isn't pay to win as only character cosmetics are locked behind a pay wall. the game is roughly balanced (although MMR is whack because of the player count) with only 3 weapon loadouts you can preset. The starting gun is mostly the gun you'll end up using but there are tons more guns to choose from. a big gripe is the weapon handling as and when i move while aiming down sights and firing a sniper rifle (MSR for an example), the aim is way off. I have used the MSR sniper rifle in real life. I asked if i could use the range to try moving and shooting, and as i did, the bullet shot not far from where i was aiming. In Black squad your sniper fires as if you didn't even try to aim. Jump shoting I can understand accuracy varying, not moving and shooting shouldn't require you to stand still for a second while getting fucked from the front.
The game isn't terrible, but it's not pedestal worthy either. It's a good game to play with friends and is what i would consider a rare gem in the FTP category that is worth about 20 minutes worth your time to try."
8784,"Positives:

1) It's pleasing to shoot in this game. The audio and visual response gives you the feeling that you're doing some damage, which is perfect because most of the games don't do it right. Aiming doesn't punish your movement speed, and I love it.

2) It allows you to play with bots, another awesome point about it. It could have bots playing in your team in grand matches, but doesn't have, unfortunately.

3) It runs on a low-end PC. It has done well in mine.

Negatives:

1) The visuals are horrible. Most of the time you can't distinguish the enemies from the environment. Since I'm a Team Fortress 2 player, it gets a lot confusing to look at in this game, since there's a lot of unnecessary information on the screen.

2) Not just the main menu, but the entire UI is ♥♥♥♥. Lot's of unnecessary and small information on the screen that if you don't have a patience of a monk (Or maybe a good vision), you will quickly quit this game. Lots of tabs in the game won't guide you into a match, resulting in a waste of time searching for it. And not just that: The Quick Match option is dead because no one plays on Quick Match. The only way to find matches is to search for rooms in the room list, but as I said, the UI is a giant ""♥♥♥♥ You"" in your face and it does really well on it, because it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ to find the list and also hard to remember where this thing is.
There are four giant buttons in the main menu screen and a bunch of really small buttons under them that are not important and won't lead you into any match, even if you're an experienced player. The many more buttons and icons are dedicated exclusively to microtransactions (Not that microtransactions in a F2P game is a bad thing, but for ♥♥♥♥'s sake, make the main menu look like an actual main menu, not the shopping menu)"
8785,Nice game
8786,Yuh
8787,"Really good game, not sure why it is getting hate in the reviews. I barely ever see hackers, the gunplay is good, and you can get cool and rare skin without spending a penny. runs 80+ fps on my garbage PC too when i turn the graphics down a bit. Lots of different guns and its a ton of fun collecting new guns and skins. 

the best sniper is the Blazer r93, thank me later."

8806,Very fun
8807,nah
8808,nice game
8809,Was a good game to play instead of csgo but not csgo is free so while the game is good I prefer csgo
8810,good fps game highly recommended alternative to boring cs-go.

8813,"Was one of the best game,but now dead. Still miss those days.you can try it.."
8814,Terrible game!
8815,Honestly one of the most fun games I have played in ages. I haven't played a game like this for years. There are cheaters and all that but what kind of multiplayer game doesn't have that tbh.
8816,"I have Ryzen 5 2600 and AMD Vega 56 with 16Gb of DDR4 ram. I only managed to get 15 fps on the LOWEST SETTINGS.

But hackers should be banned and all items should be tradeable and marketable in steam.
Offline play should be come where people can play bot and practice when they are offilne.
and then it will be much better than any other game... <3"

8840,"I absolutely love this game. I feel a nice graphical update can really turn this game into a higher level FPS. Its a shame I don't see a lot of people playing this game but while I was playing it I fell in love. CSGO was a game I played religiously but Black Squad to me felt more tuned towards skill over randomness. 

With that said the only problem I have is the game feels a bit cartoony and less realistic graphics wise. Which is why I said updated graphics and an overhaul of UI can make this game appear more appealing to other gamers who are coming into the game."
8841,Game is absolutely dookie. Most games you play the people youre playing with have 500ping. hit boxes? Dont need them on this game because they jumping around the map with lag anyways
8842,Feels like more of a mobile game than anything but it's alright
8843,It's like McDonalds. Trash but tasty from time to time.
8844,shit

8852,"HONEST REVIEW:- MOST UNDERRATED GAME OF ALL TIME!
THIS IS THE BEST FAST PACE FPS SHOOTER YOU CAN FIND OUT THERE!"
8853,cheaters everuqhwereree
8854,"If you like grinding for guns and want fast paced action this is for you.

it seems that you can buy guns with real money and some guns are locked behind paywalls
but they aren't exactly better than the guns you can get by grinding so technically it isn't p2w,

but it also isn't exactly a perfect game either where people buy female characters and spam left right so you can't hit them with their smaller hitbox.

but if you don't mind getting into the meta and using what other players are using then this game is for you.

It isn't for me and i wish i could give it a ""not bad but not perfect"" but unless steam adds an option like that it's gonna be a negative from me."
8855,i really like this game it feels like old cod i love it
8856,Shitty
8857,this game is almost like nexon zombies
8858,"honestly my opinions on this game are mixed, it feels like a shitty csgo rip off that's trying to employ cod style shooting and it's just kinda eh

also ngl it does feel a bit weird and all over the place, it's also confusing af

overall it was pretty fun but it's not really good tbh"

8865,"This is just a strange game. Damage  and movements mechanics doesn't match. Let me explain, this game has maps and character maneuverability like CS, but your hitpoints disappear faster than in COD. And one fun thing. This is the only game I can recall which has a bullet-in-a-barrel reloading system. This is just rediculous system for a game with this low level of realism in any other part."
8866,"EDIT: after reinstalling went to a black screen then wouldn't load at all? i have no idea why this game isn't working i have games much more graphics intensive yet this wont load past a black screen! lol..

OLD:
Well i can't even get it to load so i am not sure i can even accurately give a review on this game so if it magically starts working when after i finish reinstalling it i will give a review on yay or nay"
8867,"To be honest it is a good game. But beside adding new guns or time to time maps, they haven't really made any update to the gameplay since I have been playing this game, and believe me it's a long time. They should add:
1. Gun parts to be purchased and equipped to the gun.
2. Peeking left and right like in PUBG.
3. Running with guns not only with knife.
4. Add a survival mode.
5. Add quick random match (it will put you in a random game mode) - this has 2 good sides: 1. Reduces waiting time. 2. Makes more modes playable.

8882,"[h1]There's so much about this game that is not right, which is a shame because it has lots of potential.[/h1]

---These are the things that I have to say---

[b]Positives:[/b]

   1) It's pleasing to shoot in this game. The audio and visual response gives you the feeling that you're doing some damage, which is perfect because most of the games don't do it right. Aiming doesn't punish your movement speed, and I love it.

   2) It allows you to play with bots, another awesome point about it. It could have bots playing in your team in grand matches, but doesn't have, unfortunately.

   3) It runs on a low-end PC. It has done well in mine.

[b]Negatives:[/b]

   1) The visuals are horrible. Most of the time you can't distinguish the enemies from the environment. Since I'm a Team Fortress 2 player, it gets a lot confusing to look at in this game, since there's a lot of unnecessary information on the screen.

   2) Not just the main menu, but the entire UI is shit. Lot's of unnecessary and small information on the screen that if you don't have a patience of a monk (Or maybe a good vision), you will quickly quit this game. Lots of tabs in the game won't guide you into a match, resulting in a waste of time searching for it. And not just that: The Quick Match option is dead because no one plays on Quick Match. The only way to find matches is to search for rooms in the room list, but as I said, the UI is a giant ""Fuck You"" in your face and it does really well on it, because it's a pain in the ass to find the list and also hard to remember where this thing is.
There are four giant buttons in the main menu screen and a bunch of really small buttons under them that are not important and won't lead you into any match, even if you're an experienced player. The many more buttons and icons are dedicated exclusively to microtransactions (Not that microtransactions in a F2P game is a bad thing, but for fuck's sake, make the main menu look like an actual main menu, not the shopping menu)

   3) The input mapping and movement in this game are lame. It tries to be F.E.A.R in its concept, which is good, but will also try to difficult your gameplay at all cost. The ""running"" button in this game is the mouse wheel, and when your character runs it switches to a knife(?). It would be a lot simple if you just remove this button because there's already a knife button. Jumping and crouching is a disaster: it's slow and inaccurate. Lot's of important buttons in places by default that would make any ergonomics specialist cry in disgust, because they're too far away from the hands that it just confuses you in the time you need them (Of course, you can change it in the input configs, but it's still a bad thing). The equipments placement is also something that I hate: You need to stay still to place a Sentry Gun, because ""ReAlIsM BiTcH""; the Grenade Launcher of the Rifle is bullshit, because it should explode on contact like in every single other game, but it doesn't occur, and its splash damage is laughable, because it explodes ONE FEET near an enemy and doesn't do any damage.
If you really want to make a challenging game, then work on the bots A.I. and mechanics, but don't fuck with the inputs and gameplay, dammit, because it's unfair.

   4) The map designs are awful and disgusting. Lots of places that look relevant but are just dead ends and won't lead you anywhere.

   5) There's no soundtrack in this game, or... at least, not during the matches... The main menu, which should be a peaceful part of the game, where you need to think about what you're going to do next and check at your things in the inventory, achieves to be more chaotic than the actual matches. It just plays two tracks, with 1min/30secs(?) each, and both tracks are just a shitstorm of stressful and mindless heavy metal that plays non-stop (And you're reading it from someone that listens to metalcore all day and likes it, music in the same level of Fit For A King and Undead Corporation).
   
   6) I'm having a headache from all of this, then... more sins on you.

   7) The tutorial is disgusting because it doesn't teach you anything. It was literally made to serve you as a prologue, and is more concerned about showing ""ThE AwEsOmE CiNeMaTiCs aNd mOsT AdVaNcEd gRaPhIcS Of tHe gEnErAtIoN!!!111!!!1!!"" than actually explaining the basics.

   8) For some reason, my entire account was reseted(?), including my progress, the configurations, and many other things.

   9) The reloading of the weapons is totally buggy. The game will neve give you a full magazine for reloading the weapon, and the numbers never show the exact amount of bullets in the magazines, and most of the time YOU LOSE bullets while reloading.

   10) For some reason too, the game also lacks of graphic options in the settings."

8886,"Community is very toxic, and basically is a worse version of COD. COD mobile is better."
8887,2/10
8888,"Chinese CS:GO knock off . all gun sprays are pretty much all RNG , couple that with the tactic always being run and gun and you have yourself a game based on luck rather than pure aim . 

when you first begin you're treated to one of the worst tutorials ever made , you can't change your settings during the tutorial which makes it just a useless dump of information that you will probably just change later . 

the maps are just horrible as around 4 of the six in the game encourage camping and sniping . which is just amplified by the fact that you always spawn from the same spot , meaning the sniper you just ran to is still there waiting for you to just come back again . 

not to mention all the small little things that don't really break the game but just hold it back, like: character skins that help hide enemies , not allowing the player to choose if they want to hold or toggle walking , frame rate drops even on high end pc's , not allowing map votes ,and the flashes going on for too long . 

all in all the game is a Chinese mess with an identity crisis that could grow to be better, but for now just play CS as it's also free ."
8889,Game is great but the TDM maps suck.  Stick to Demolition.  There's a lot of cheaters but the anti-cheat will kick them pretty quickly.
8890,Play with friends for best memes

8892,"this game has a lot of potential to be the go-to free to play shooter for pc, like A LOT and i had fun, i usually ignore people who complain of cheaters and write it off as them sucking but good god there is no mistaking it in this game. every single match there is going to be at least two guys just annihilating you. this game actually has a nice TTK and recoil which makes hacking that much more obvious and frustrating

TLDR: go play americas army: proving grounds, its the same game and also free or deatmatch mode on csgo or go buy mw2. its identical to this without cheaters and the feeling of the chineese government spying through your computer"

For all i know, game developers are supposed to fix their issues, and not tell the player something that *may* help. May isn't will."
8899,I can't believe how much input lag I have in this game. Haven't had this problem with any other fps. Not optimized properly? Who knows.
8900,"I tried for a solid 30 minuted to get someone in the global chat to talk with me, apparenty everyone seems to be brainded in a way.
Also really silly how people try to ACTUALLY get good in this shipwreck of a game, its just silly and got me laughing for long.
This game is PACKED with hackers and cheaters, in one lobby you'll get 2-4 cheaters it was dead a year ago so what do I expect now? 
Dont waste yur time. This game WAS an opption until CS:GO went f2p. 

Just get CS:GO (BECAUSE ITS FREE) you'll have MUCH more fun with that.

I experience almost two crashes per hour while im trying to play, tried reinstalling, repairing, it persists, and by the looks of it, it happens to a lot of people

It is really bad since you can't rejoin a game you were playing before the crash, so when it crashes you lose all of your progress, and it is frustrating.

Another huge problem is that the game lacks any kind of ingame player report system, and it is something the game really needs, as ive seem today a guy enter the game just to stand still hitting a box with his knife so he didnt get kicked, and didnt had to play, it sucked"

8947,I can not even play without this game either crashing itself or locking up my entire pc. Unplayable.
8948,For a free to play game it's good. I used to play this one a lot but realized that the recoil patterns in this game are random and mostly luck based. So this is more of a fun game to play that doesn't teach you much about the actual fps world out there. The skins are great and maps are great too. The community has seen a downfall due to some ping related issues and fps drops. Overall it is worth a shot if you're looking for casual gameplay.
8949,"Same basic principals as CSGO with a bit more Si-fi added, wich has HUGE potential, game still has a bit of tweeking to go before getting noticed."

Every map is a mirror for the teams, and every map can be spawn camped pretty hard. They desperately need to make more unique maps.... Heck, just more maps. It's getting boring."
8968,"I think it is a very nice FPS game out there that is not P2W (and because of that I spent some money on it just to support the game to be here for a long time). I like how it doesn't really lag much on my computer, very few cheaters (as far as I've encountered - I used to play Point Blank and you see other players flying everywhere, auto aim that was very obvious, wallhacking that could be seen clearly if you're on the same team as the hacker.) I didn't really see that happening on BS YET during my time spent in this game. Most people who get high kill rate are just truly good players who are calm and know how to wait, not rush to die. The only downside of this game is it's not available on Mac :( Anw, great job BS team!"

Even some skins give u boost and gold xp (...), still cheaters but yeah this game was good in his first 6 months, then it was dead and it will stay as a dead game

I pray for player who buy like 1000 $ of skins and they can't sell it to get a lil' bit refund like 500$ because they leaved the game 
 
I know there is some great and good (in skill and social interaction) players, but it's the fking hell here, people are too toxic when they used vc because matchmaking makes u drop with cobra and u are eagle

9003,"GAME CRASHES,bugs,fps drops,new skins rather than fixing the game but fk all that i still have 3000h of gameplay broke 6 mouses and 2 laptops  on this game buts still playing it and dunno why  it's best fps i'v ever played add me if u need a walkthrough. amine27559"
9004,its is nice but would be better with controller too if there is dis like this then alot
9005,boring
9006,"If you are ready to play this game, prepare to face off player with an extremely high ping. And a bunch of spanish idiots who keeps saying:""Jajajaja"" like a god damn retards.
Being extremely honest, I did gave this game a pretty high hope and expectation since this had potentials. However, I am very disappointed by the sever problems and the player attitudes. Throughout the game play, I had to bear with above 200 ping the entire time, which eventually causing player with lower ping to kill me first although I clearly killed them. Now you might ask. well why don't you just play a room with good ping? Well, I would love to......if I can....There are absolute zero rooms nor servers that is in the NA server, therefore I can't even choose. It's actually sad to see that such a good game is being worse and worse."
9007,"This game is not recommended. Please do not try this. It will kill you. As you playing the game, your intelligence is reducing, and after few games, you literally need to see a doctor. This game will lead you to be retarded. Seriously do not try it for your health and security."
9008,"Lleeeetttt meeee sell my itemmmmmmmmm
"
9009,good games. is fun
9010,"If you take Call of Duty and make a rip-off of that, you get Warface. When you rip-off Warface, you get S.K.I.L.L.S. Special Forces 2. And if you rip-off S.K.I.L.L.S. Special Forces 2, you get Paintball War. And when you rip-off Paintball War you get this... The worst first person shooter in history"
9011,iz good and cool skins
9012,"its one of the greatest games i ve ever played so far , but those cheaters goshh .... there some hacks that i found out on youtube the anti cheat system cannot detect em so it means that protection of this game is low so yeah you ll be always agree even if you play deathmatch , but imagine if you have to mess with one or more in ranked game :/ ""UPS"""
9013,"WORST GAME EVER
CAN'T EVEN START THE GAME"
9014,Decent
9015,"Pretty good game but it doesn't even run properly anymore, fix your game maybe? I had a lot of fun when I could play it without issue, but now it doesn't even start properly without crashing on my end."
9016,Just like minecraft!
9017,nice
9018,"This game is dead. cant find a game to jump into, all servers have that were on display were from over sees, no NA servers that I could find with a stable ping. This is my first review and I gotta say that this was a bit of a let down cause I wanted to play this game but just look at my time with it and none of that was from actual gameplay."
9019,Great Game..... BUT!!!! Prepare for camping endless Sniper's
9020,thes game very good
9021,"Reminds me of the old school free to play shooters. 

-Small Maps
-No tactics
-Throw Grenade at the start of each life
-Zero Purpose"
9022,Stinkie winkie
9023,"I have a high end pc, and this game always open ups to 17fps.... Bad optimization"
9024,Due to a VERY high workload I cannot write a review. Please stay patient as your review will arrive in a FEW days. ;)
9025,error 0x0000
9026,A very nice game!
9027,"you like chaos? dont worry this game has it
do you like an fps thats pretty chill and calm? this game is it
want the ultimate free to play fps? well look no further black squad has you covered
want an fps thats for potato pcs? yeah this game is one of em
Overall Blacksquad is a rare gem and it deserves more attention its just one of those games you have to own tbh every weapon in the game is obtainable and the game has come a long way since i played it i recommend it"
9028,"Game is dying. Not much people playing Quick Match, server location is so far off, you won't have problem getting a 300+ ping.
I used to play this game, now not anymore."
9029,"Fails to distinguish itself visually or through gameplay from similarly cheap F2P cashgrabs. It's probably the best of them, but that doesn't make it worth playing."
9030,"The game had a very good start , there is just not enough content, and the servers , they are dying , there are not enough people , they are not aware that people have CSGO to play , their market here , is people who don't own csgo, kinda...
I own it , I just wanted to give the game a try , it is just the overall experience of the game , that makes it so bad , the weapons , there is an annoying bug or idk how to call it , (maybe only I experience it) , that the weapon is switching , to melee or pistol , and I can't play normally.

That is not the main problem however , the main problem is much worse.
Making a game compete with a game that has far better and greater player base ,and is not free ,only proves how this idea fails , this game has nothing unique over previous games I  have played , I played a lot of free to play fps games, Combat Arms , A.V.A , soldier front , this game has nothing that backs it up , it is a generic unreal engine fps game.

EDIT: they removed demolition mode that is , a mode where you break the enemy's boxes , I loved it , instead they made it casual mode and added arms race , they only made the game worse. Quite sad that they just killed the game. 



There is not enough content in the game , Combat Arms , a game that is terrible , had more content , nexon ruined it , and sadly this is what NS Studio are doing as well.

Making a competitive mode , when I need to wait around at least 30 seconds , for a team deathmatch (sometimes even more) , for an 8 vs 8 ,(sometimes it says it found 60 players and still searching...) , funny,  and it shows the state of this game.

it is truly sad that this game , has died as well , everything has greed after all , but if you have not enough player base , you shooting yourself twice, one for making a mode that is barley played , and secondly , having a game with not enough content to make the player base grow."
9031,the fun ga
9032,Good Game in all the ways But Ping and compettitive balance is weird
9033,great game
9034,Too bad
9035,"Ok, imma leave an HONEST REVIEW.

This game is very similar to CSGO in many ways, but it has better graphics and more gun options. If you prefer grinding out guns this is your game. If you prefer just playing get CSGO. Skins are cheaper in BS."
9036,ITS VERY GOOD GAME
9037,"a pay too win if you want it to be, but its just another csgo rip off"
9038,"for me the game is dead why ? full of wallhack
no option to report ,
test it for your self and you will realise that soon :("
9039,TAC RELOAD!
9040,NOT BAD DUDE FOR A CHILD HOOD GAME
9041,top
9042,SIMPLE.
9043,"the things that made me quit:

-lots of cheater
-no report button! you need to record your gameplay just to make a demo out of it and then sent it to their support. lazy bums.
-reported player sometimes go unpunished
-horrible lag compensation and matchmaking queues you against 180ms player! why? because they want to ""give every player a nice experience""! BS

tl;dr if you want to play a cs/cod mix with a nice gameplay and a lazy incompetend dev team that slowly kills its own game and is only there to milk cash, then yes, install this game."
9044,well its good fps shooter but have some big issues with hackers !
9045,"Not bad, but not good

10/5"
9046,"Pretty fun game, fast paced and cool skins.

One negative would be the matchmaking, it does take a long time to find a match hope it gets fixed soon"
9047,"played many mornings before school. quick fun action at your disposal. Fast paced and very arcade like,just like call of duty.

love the game and is a 100% recommend in my book, not to mention its also free;)"
9048,"This game is good but too many glitches

9050,great game
9051,good  game
9052,asd
9053,"
admistradir why you do not take the mods that you are not using because my pc is not very good

and i am from Brazil
"
9054,No :(
9055,It is a good game
9056,Good characters. Yah!
9057,"I don't why people give bad reviews even until now 9/12/2019
It's honestly a really good game
I have all the weapons in the game with spending a single cent.
I got all the ingame currency from doing daily quest and playing some matches.
I play competitive and tons of tdm and i don't meet a single hacker.
I am an eagle. So i kinda know how to play the game
It's a ton of fun to play with friends and mess around.
I would even sometimes tryhard.
The graphics are really good
The gameplay is really nice
It fells smooth
More gunplay
Smaller maps= Fast Paced.
The only thing you need money is for buying high quality skins with ""Custom"" Animations on it.
Knifes,pistols,and rifles Even Characters are purchasable with spending 0 cent to the game."
9058,This is a fun game to play i suggest u should give it a try
9059,Stupid controls.
9060,"It's like Counter Strike with better gunplay and graphics.
I really recommend it.

More than you can expect for FREE

Score - 9/10"
9061,.
9062,Its actually pretty good tbh.
9063,Best Game ever played.
9064,12121
9065,Shit game....
9066,"The worst player movement, aim and weapon feel i`ve seen in years."
9067,nice game
9068,nice
9069,"Good game, but the community is trash. If you are good at this game you will be viewed as a hacker by noobs. And there are a ton of noobs. It's not even hard to be good in this game as it has a low skill cap unlike a game like counter strike. Otherwise fun game.
"
9070,"So much cheating going on in this game.
People shooting through structures and people using aim bots is rampant.
Because the game highlights the person that kills you you can clearly see where they killed you from
Several times in one match I'm killed by someone that could not have possibly seen me much less one shot killed me
there were structures in the way.
People are running up and one shot killing when there's no possible way a real person can acquire head shot in that short period of time
Like most competitive games this one is full of people cheating and nothing is being done about it...

any competitive game that has cheating is a failure."
9071,wd
9072,"Good game, good BAN system."
9073,"Good game, would recommend for those who like a CS:GO/Call of duty type of game.
It's free and all but you can buy things or earn them by winning games and getting kills."
9074,Played the game for a few jours and made already money with inventory items.
9075,i prefer play CODOL instead this game.yea this one is like COD but armor and health point is just stupid and some weapon with no recoil u can buy on shop for free
9076,"this game is coming to the end
"
9077,How come I seem to be playing the same three maps. How do you play the other maps?
9078,"knock off csgo, is trrash, and shouldnt exist"
9079,nice game
9080,"Hackers,Unrealistic"
9081,"Its alright i keep getting ""disconnected"" mid game"
9082,"Overall a good game, simple run & gun shooter you can play for hours,
although there are a few things i would like to see improved... 

like the game menu / UI which is really clunky to navigate, as well as creating / joining groups, 
but i would also like to see a map filter put in the game as there are some really good & really bad maps.

Finally liek all modern games i would prefer to the old skool business model of 'purchasing a game & expansions' 
rather than the p2w cash shop in all modern 'free' games.

"
9083,))
9084,"Totally an amazing game,players need to give it a chance..😃😃"
9085,always die almost never on winning team waste of time one shot kills high cheater rate
9086,i need carakter
9087,"I keep getting Disconnected from server code 0x00000000 error so i can't play this game... Game itself is great, but i can't play it cuz error won't let me and Devs don't give a shitt about that error and ppl who got that error... They're keep saying that it's common steam issue, but nothing from steam support helps me. I'm really disappointed about Devs who won't fix A COMMON ISSUE. Like i said the game is great but i can't play it and it hurts me :/ For now i'll leave negative opinion."
9088,slowly dying still fun to play with friends here and there
9089,good game nice grafic best game eva
9090,where do i report luiboo player cheating!!!!
9091,Very fair geniue F2P Games without Pay2Win machanisim
9092,NIGGA chEESE
9093,"GOOOOOD
"
9094,"this game was the best  back in 2017 and 2018, but now it sucks to the fulliest ,game crashes alot, fps drops asf , bugs everywhere , errors , ping problems ..etc , it could have been a great fps game more like csgo or better , but the devs keep killing the game slowly + they don""t even give a shit about it . i spend 2k hours from my life for this game i rly enjoyed it so much but now i don't think so ."
9095,"2 months player here, 1st month was good mid 2nd month I'm starting to have a problem. While I'm playing it crashed but no blue screen it just suddenly close the app and i spent more than $150 already on this game."
9096,shit game
9097,Awsome awsome game i play it all the time.
9098,"Always force close, i dont know why, pls fix it. ty"
9099,k boring i guess
9100,"To put simply the game is shit, a cheap Korean knock off fps. Jumping is not very optimized as well as grenade tosses. Maps are so damn small it might as well be a dodgeball arena, not very versatile.Can't customize gun attachments but the biggest issue is i can barely play a game before the fucking thing crashes and it crashes on a consistent basis. 
This game is has tons of issues, my first game the map ends up being soo damn small once the enemy spawned and their invulnerable wore off they'd just get spawn camped with no spawn reversals or anything and to kick it off most of the maps are that small. Not a very high skill game either with very few game modes so essentially it gets boring.
I cannot for the life of me recommend this game but ill continue to suffer since this is the only fps game my buddy can play. Sorry to those who enjoy the game but imo its just a slack version of an actual fps game.
N64 007 Golden Eye had better maps than this for multiplayer."
9101,"PEACE OF CHEATER SHIT
AND NO SUPPORT FROM DEVS!"
9102,nice  XD
9103,"best game i have played ever  but the owner's of this game brain is dead
so game is dead too"
9104,"It's a good game. Before game always crashed, now game has too high latency I'm play on SEA ."
9105,"I know I played this game just for 7 hours, but the crashes really pisses you off, like wth.
overall the game is really good.

cheers~~"
9106,"Absolute trash game. Just way to easy with no real skill but youll crash easily while on a streak. Your typical cash grab game from some shitty asian company. It has a built in lobby simulator too get to wait 5-10 minutes for ""one of the most played FPS games on steam "". So great i get to wait forever to play then play 5 minutes only for it to crash randomly several times. Guns are all the same. One shot snipers for your no scope COD kiddies.Crappy gun models and voiced characters that are just atrocious. I mean I'd probably have more of a challenge in minecraft than this spaghetti ware. Like if there was some semblance of skill to this game its lost admist all the copy paste crap from other asian quick made games. I think more effort is put into my review then on this game. They advertise a big show which is why it draws in a crowd because sheeple will just flock to anything advertised as decent not knowing any better."
9107,Look at me
9108,"why game keeps crashing ???
please FIX it.. thanks , have a good day"
9109,"Good Free2Play Game, you get a lot of items for free and you can earn items very easily. It's a fun game to play with friends.

Sometimes there are hackers, but it's not a crazy issue in my experience; you can just leave the match or something like that.

Competitive queue times take too long, not enough people play the game :(

The skins in this game are amazing, way cooler (and cheaper) than skins from other games, like CSGO skins

Great Partner system in this game, the Community Managers are very friendly.

I recommend everybody to at least try this game!"
9110,I literally cant even start the game up. Ive been trying out fixes and none of them have been working
9111,"Muy pay to win, lastima el juego tiene graficos decentes y es muy divertido , hasta que sale un negro con un arma de 5000 pesos y te mata de un tiro, en ese momento se acaba la divercion"
9112,"- No ingame report system.
- Running into cheaters every 2 or 3 games
- Massive ping difference between players ( the more you lag the more you win )
- Developers are only interested in Money

05/09/2019

- Consistent crashing"
9113,"Its a good alternative to CS:GO if you worry about the file size. It has different class to chose from. Pretty much has the same game mode as other similar classic FPS. Give it a try. I am no longer playing it because I am been playing this type of game for a very long time. Counter Strike 1.6 was my jam back in the day, it was a good time T_T"
9114,Great game
9115,"Oh man Oh man 
This game is filled to the brim with white supremecists
telling people they should die if they are not white, saying its good 6 million jews + countless people
died in world war 2 and the only horrible thing about world war 2, is that the wrong side won.
i've gotten threatened countless times, people telling me i should be dead, and they will kill me if they meet me in real life exc...
i've got atleast 30 videos or even more, of people shaming me for being a jew and people threatenig me, if you want proof i can send you some.
the game is good, the community beyond saving.
I will probably continue playing but who knows for how long, as i am sick of this racist community who just loves to say anne frank must've enjoyed getting raped and burned and that its what she deservse for being a jew :D"
9116,Nice alternative to CS:GO
9117,"maybe a matchmaking system so you play with people in a similar skill group, and less micro transactions to boost your win rate. other than that, it's decent at a push."
9118,"This is CSGO only with better gunplay, better optimization, soldiers with COD Abilities/Skills, free static and dynamic gun skins, and a great diverse multiplayer. (16 vs 16, 8 vs 8) It also have a growing community, updated ""Anti-cheat system"" (BattlEye) on par with competitive Fortnite, R6 Siege and PUBG. And Yes FREE DLC."
9119,TAC RELOAD
9120,"nice game but all player is cheater 
"
9121,"Hmmmm i first i will say about + soo:
""+""
- it working
-its free to play
- not Pay2win
and now the finalle so 
""-"" 
- most important cheats all welcome ofc if you will pay for them 
- community market now suck better than Titans after Vacaction 
- BattleEye
- Broken weapon spray
- tickrate is 15 sometimes looks like 1 
- all update give only new skins
- you can't report cheater in game menu 


for me i can rate this game
playable 2/10
anticheat  -1000/10
Producent care about community 0/10 
Graphics 5/10 
weapon spray 2/10 
tickrate - 0/10 
Skins 10/10 
Free to play 10/10 
"
9122,"Bought a new computer because I thought it was causing all the crashes but it turns out its just the game. Also keep getting 0xc0000007b error. I have literally tried everything but nothing work. Fiquerd it out by my better half,, I do love this game"
9123,ye
9124,"bru
"
9125,"This game copied roblox, it has like A LOT like roblox like Just LOOK AT THWE GRPAHICS ITS ALSO KINDA LIKE HEAVYLY MODDED MIJNEcrafT"
9126,Not a bad game i like it
9127,It’s a meh for me
9128,"Fucking bad game, only work when you have a bad connection :D I mean only heads or you die so much of luck, and of course do it when you're running because if you don't you'll get a random headshot from nowhere or a sniper bullet :D
Best of luck to you new players ^^ I'm not coming back ever again, the devs have killed this game a long time ago :) can't even listen to us so the game is in my trashcan for a while now..."
9129,"Cons:
- Lack of anti-cheat management. 
- Laggers and cheaters WILL always win no matter how hard you try.
- Cheating report does nothing at all. Don't bother it, seriously.
- Mouse input isn't always optimal even with high frame rate.
- High level of toxicity among communities. There are however few of communities aren't.
- Very expensive paid in-game currency value, however can be rather cheap if promoted with seasonal event.
- Lots of hidden weapons can only be purchased from Steam Community Market. Thankfully just a re-skin of existing original weapon but in different model.
- Gacha is pure garbage. Both for paid and grind ones seems have same rate from my experience.

Pros:
+ At some point can be P2W, but you may able to obtain gather all vanilla weapons with grinding and daily login. Be sure check the DLC section for 1st Anniversary and Fortune Box DLCs for freebies.
+ All weapons are permanent both default and purchased with various in-game currency.
+ Skins on weapons are pure cosmetic and can be used right away without to own its original version.

Final note: Uninstalled the game. Either too frustrated against laggers or cheaters, or just like others said - I'm just really suck at everything due to my mediocre skills in general."
9130,"start lagging at the second I get in the game, cant even play the starting cg and moving mouse."
9131,"All games are cheaters in game

9137,This game is bad.
9138,its a good game but not many people play it but otherwise its a good game i vote no cause takes a long time to play
9139,bad game
9140,i like this game
9141,Was Good Now Not
9142,"this game would be great, but it has the worst servers and is fun up until you want to improve and play better, but cant because you literally die to people off your screen as the ping is to much for Australian players"
9143,good game
9144,Not worth playing
9145,meh
9146,"this game is very poorly optimized when your not in a gun fight u get over a hundred fps (depends on your rig) and when your in a gun fight the game shits its self and drops u to 50 fps (in my case) and it will stay like that through out the whole gun fight, on top of that the server issues are a big problem so much lag even when im playing on the best sever that they give me, mind u all these problems dont happen in bot tdm, but overall this game needs more work before it becomes enjoyable just play csgo if u want really good fps and consistency"
9147,i would say the game it self can be challanging but really fund to play. All tho i would recoment good players to this game who has a good experiance whit anykind shooter thing in the head :P
9148,"i think the game is good, if you can get it to open.
why cant i get the game to open more.
after trying to work this out for 40min it now open and ther is nothing wrong with my comuputer that i know of.
the game is good but if ther is something wrong with the game, i want it fixed"
9149,"Black Squad is a mix of COD & CS. The controls is your average FPS, but one thing that bothers me is that you can't change the key bindings for sprinting. The matchmaking could use some work; if you're a new player. your level does not matter. The game will put you with people that have better experience. 

One MAJOR thing that kept on happening, is the constant crashing. The game decides to crash whenever it wants to. If you're in a firefight it will crash, even looking at the main menu, the game will crash. Other people are saying that there's hackers/cheaters in the game. I did not experience any of those players in the lobbies that I was placed in.

Ultimately, the crashes is what made me quit this game. If you're still interested to check this game out, I would say go for it. But, go with low expectations. 

"

9155,shit
9156,"this game needs a hell of a lot more american servers, I can't stand going into matchmaking with 200 ping because I'm playing with europeans, other than that you have to make sure the game isn't in full screen or else when you mess with the settings it will hardlock your pc, also disable steam overlay because that's a big contributing factor, but other than that the game is pretty responsive and fun to play"

9166,"I have no problems with other games, but in this game I've been disconnected like every almost second match. Thought it will be nice substitude of CS, but no, it is rubbish!"
9167,"I like this game but, pls update it with new weapons or new special suits"
9168,"fast paced game, a lot of weapons and options to buy them. events and luck help you get more custom items and pure skill is very needed here. 
I got tons of money but I got used to the beginner weapon and i don't really need more to be at the top of the list."
9169,this game is wonderful
9170,Reminds me of csgo and black ops. Gotta say tho it's kinda fun
9171,"if you want a time carryer this is it¨

but not for long"
9172,its a great game but  you need a high specifications in order to play professionally or you will suffer while you play
9173,Love myself a game that dosent start. even after 1hour+ of waiting.
9174,"edit 12/2019 : Game is close to end, devs and support has given up, no anykind improvements, only merge players and removed whole game balance, and cheaters has flooding in without any bans, sad story, game was very good.

Game was pretty good but...

Problems are laggers, hit reg, and cheaters : 
- That makes no sense they let ppl with 180ping play even competitive mode (custom rooms ping can be anything 300-988).
- Hit reg is pretty random especially vs high pingers (you can get killed before you even see enemy coming, and behind corners).
- Cheaters, BattlEye won't detect anything and it get updated 1 or 2 times in a year, and when reporting cheater it takes really long time when they get banned (even 2 months), and in that time theres 50 new cheaters in game who can cheat without any probs, playing in last 30 days is totally useless waste of time cause lot of cheaters, and ofc thats not enough, theres griefers and AFKs too."
9175,"Black Squad is a competent and  mostly no-frills iteration of the Counter-Strike style tactical shooter. It's simple and fun, if not particularly unique or technically impressive.

Pros:
-competent maps with interesting sightlines and fun places to play at whatever range you like
-varied and cool weapons which can all aim down sights and add silencers or turn on laser on the fly
- no pay to win. pay options are cosmetic only. liberal drops of currency and trial weapons.
-good selection of game modes. TDM, plant the bomb skirmish, and a war mode with scorestreak-style ability progression.
-cool sound effects, especially the headshot splat.

Cons:
-Graphics are dated and ugly. Maps are bland and generic looking, though well designed.
-Movement control is somewhat primitive. No sprint, crouching only, no prone, no lean. Knife running is faster than walking and therefore replaces sprint, which feels anachronistic and silly. Even CSGO did away with this mechanic IIRC.
-Some grinding for better weapons is necessary for new players. It's nothing too tedious but might turn off a new player who wants to try all the weapons right away.
-no Free for All deathmatch

Conclusion:
Black Squad is effectively Counter-Strike with better gun physics and no buy system. It's competent, engaging, simple and fun to drop into and enjoy a match, and has a pretty easy learning curve for those familiar with the genre. Its technical shortcomings are balanced nicely by the fact that it has very low hardware requirements and will run playably on just about anything. It may not look like much but Black Squad delivers on gunplay and has been a staple for me as a warm-up or cool-down from more complicated games."
9176,gn
9177,So far it's just a waiting simulator.
9178,Overall a good game! Played for a couple years on and off with a IRL friend and ended up sitting and enjoying this game for hours on end! I recommend 100%
9179,Its good for time pass. u know what i mean!!
9180,"Dead game for US players. 

Gotta either suffer with crappy ping playing with EU or play with bots by yourself."
9181,"good to play at internet cafe with your guys on an crap PC 
Loved IT !"
9182,hands down its great but it is a little hard for people who are new at first person shooter but you will get better but i will say this don't trust the steps lol
9183,"Tried this game again after about a year. Guess what? Still a piece of shit. Anti-cheat is a complete joke in this game. Every match had at least 1 hacker. Aim hacking, wall hacking, esp, you name it, it's common. The worst was when i had 3 hackers on 1 map across both teams. I said I had enough and that my camera is now recording. 5 people disconnect almost immediately. Don't waste your time on this piece of shit game until the developers get off their lazy asses and do their damn jobs. They're all complete losers, at least make your life worth something. Too bad they're too pathetic to make any progress. Just leave this world and in doing so, make it a better place..."
9184,NootNoot. Its a really fun game its some what like CS:GO which I like over all its a fun game you should play it!

9196,"my personal review: its not a pay to win you can have basic gear and as long you will do good, after 66 hours of this game i can say i have not met a single hacker or modder, one bad thing is the ping and sometimes connection issues.
its really fast paced kinda like an asian shooter. it is a tiny bit like warface but in my opinion its way better. another bad thing there is a ffffffuck ton of sweats, so i recommend when starting to do custom bot tdm.
"
9197,"This is a marvel of a game. They somehow manage to say all the right things and fail so horribly. There are 3 things needed in a game and this fails at all 3. It needs to be well explained or intuitive. It needs to have good gameplay. And it needs a nice UI.
This game is bad in 1 and HORRIBLE in 2.

UI: This has to be the worst Ui I have ever used. First off it doesn't change on resolution or aspect ratio, it is just 4:3 and that's it. There are so many things to click on that are completely useless like info or help that can be pushed aside in the settings or something. The boxes that show character and gamemode are not aligned for some unknown reason there is just 1"" of gap that could be fixed in 5 seconds. This happens a LOT. The settings are hard to look at and are cluttered tight in a small box instead of using the 16:9 screen I have. The Logo at the top right is just a logo and doesn't bring you to the home screen like any other game. And get this the home icon isn't for the home, it brings you to their website. Currencies are small in font, but take up a long horizontal distance. There are pictures that give no info. I got rewards in the game for challenges. Now in siege you click the challenge tab and click the challenge its self to collect the reward. OHH that is too hard here. Nope go to challenge menu, click challenge, click claim, click accept, and click I accept I accept. NOT EVEN KIDDING. There is stuff like this all over the game.

Intuitiveness: This game is not too hard to learn, but it kills itself right out the gate. To me a good way to learn a game is to allow a player to do anything in the game, but hint to them how and teach them about what they are doing. NOT HERE. 

-You jump right into a tutorial, that you can't change weapon, sprint, throw nades, basically jump and shoot only. Then it teaches you very slowly and without explaining anything with bad habits. What does that mean? 1/4 the way through it says to pick a class I do, and that is it nothing happens and it doesn't teach me the class. What is the point of picking it then?

-Before then it tells me to switch weapon. In this game you can scroll, press 123, or F1F2F3. Take a guess on what they force you to use through the tutorial. Yup F1,F2F3. Pros will tell you to use 123, I agree, but it is standard to use scroll, so pick one of them. 

-Then there is a whole kill people with nube tube part and it tells you too, but it just mark 1 spot and not the enemies so I shot there for a while and nothing happened. I had to kill everything with it. There is no progress bar or anything so you have to guess. I spent a while using an AR because I was sick of the nube tube and it got me no where. 

Gameplay: This is how I describe how this was made. A 10 year old kid who likes cs:go, but was a big Dice fan described the game to make to Call of Duty devs, but only devs who love anime. 

-The aiming is a mix of cs:go sprays and R6 crosshair movement. So the bullets always go where the crosshair is, but there is a pattern. There is not nearly as much crosshair customization as cs:go and every gun changes it anyways even on static so size changes are useless. 

-Movement is like cs:go where knife is faster, but for some reason bomb slows you down in hand. This is good except the bomb thing. 

- You know in cs:go how you get to buy, HAHA throw that great mechanic away, not here you have classes. Like cod you create 3 classes and use those each round. This is already bad, but it gets MUCH worse. You know in cod how you unlock weapons, same here. Except in cod you get 1 in every class right off the bat, so you can be a sniper, shotgun guy, smg, ar, lgm exotic, etc... In this game you start with a pistol and an SMG/AR thing you earn money by ranking up to afford new guns. So new players even in bomb defuse cs:go game mode are immediately all put to a disadvantage.

-You know how I said anime fans. This is because this game has a very clear military aesthetic through the entire game for guns and map assets. Until it makes them money. Because you can buy a school girl who is in a battle field with no armor, all the women are wearing belly button T shirts, some guys have business suits. Yet default dude is an American soldier at modern times. I have no problem with the woman thing, it is just the fact that for money they clearly will destroy aesthetic for guy boners.

-Defusing in this game is horrible. cs:go and this have the same time for how long the bomb is active till it explodes. Except defusing and planting are 7 seconds. Almost twice as long. It just doesn't work well with the game. Especially with the next point.

-sound: I am not against a headshot sound, or hit sounds. Although for them alone I had to put the game to 30 volume out of 100. Headshots are sooooooooooo loud. Look at cs:go it is a quick higher pitched dink sound for a short while. This game makes it into a Doom shotgun blast no matter the distance.

-Blood: There is too much blood. (I know I keep comparing to cs:go, but it is most like it) In cs:go I will admit knowing if you hit the shot or not can be hard and is something you just learn after a long time of playing. This game addresses this by loud noises and LOTS of blood. Like too much, in fact too many times I thought I killed a guy because of the amount of blood or I literally could not see him because the blood was like a smoke grenade.

-map design: These maps are horrific. So large and confusing. The mini map isn't detailed to walls enough and the maps them selves are too big with too many nothing hallways. I played on a map where there was a whole bunch of halls below A. But it is bellow A so they are not on mini map. Also why is there a below A? Just put it on the same level. It is hard for Valve a master at map design to get its 1 vertical map ""Vertigo"" right and these guys are not fixing or addressing the issues that Valve has and is. 

-servers. I was playing every game with such a mix of players. I found matches 4X faster than CS:GO or COD, but a few of my games everyone spoke Russian and had insane ping. Other games everyone was English, but everyone had high ping. Just don't find me a game above 150ping and other languages. Make times to find a match longer, but the matches better matched. 

Honestly I can keep going on small things. But this game is just a mess. It wants to be competitive, but wants to do so many Casual things. It wants to be military aesthetic, but fun. It wants to be modern, but it has the UI of a 2010 game with the options off a modern game. The Dev team to me just doesn't know what there game is and what it to be everything creating this horrible beast. I do not recommend it, but it is free. I think the UI is enough to not give this game a try."

9199,"This game has shitty matchmaking system, you get into a game with only high ranks on a team that looses 6 - 1 and when you go out you get a loose^^ nice game, fix that.

EDIT: Dropped in 2 games from 90% to 84% winrate just because i get into games that looses 6-0^^ thx for nothing."
9200,"Its basically elements of COD and CS:GO in one package. And like the Asian version of anything... its not optimized. Also, I haven't seen cheaters yet but I have seen the toxic side of the community and oh boy, lemme tell you... they're loud af. along with server issues and all that good stuff; 4/10

Edit: Quality of game changed drastically after I wrote this review. Servers: 1/10 Gameplay: 5/10

There's better games out there. I used to love this game but now its a poop fest ever since they thought this game didn't need to be updated every other day. Its a free game. What did I F'n expect?

Edit2: After uninstalling and reinstalling, the game just... fixed itself. Yes, I did verify the integrity of the files before complaining here, I looked on the forums for a solution etc... but my point remains: Quality of life updates are needed(at least for me) and optimization for lower end PCs could bring in a wider player base(I had to buy a new PC just to play this game a year ago)."

9212,"Fun game. Maybe a little weird with the microtransactions, as you have to buy guns. Other than that, it could've been a really really good free shooter if the spawns were randomized, or at the very least spawn where there are no players nearby."

9243,I don't even know where to begin... It's just another camp/run and gun (Yes I just put both in the same sentence)  Plays like garbage... A micro store for a crap game... Pure garbage game with lib gamers... Speaks volumes for the people that support this....
9244,it a good game with good misson if you played blackops its allmost the same
9245,i like the sound of headshots and i dont like the base campers and the VIP is a stupid bot
9246,"Do i recommend this game as of today? NO! 

but why is that? 
1. found there are those that have cheats in the game today that has not been detected, shooting through smoke to get constant head shots through the entire match shooting you way before you get a chance to react around the corner.

2. guns just feel to close to other games you would have played such as, cod, counter strike, halo, etc with little in the way of feeling any change.

3. far too few ways of being able to change an outcome of a gunfight, maps are way too small and have little in way of insperation aka the 3 lane system. 

the good about this game

1. guns are very accessable and easy to obtain with little playtime to become perm, meaning you don't need to spend hours of your life away to get 1 gun just to have it taken away later after a few hours, or a day.

2. the graphics and game itself is quite nice visually.

3. even with the cheaters running amuck within the game, and the no life players, the game can still be enjoyed if you like to wait 10 to sometimes 25 mins que times in between matches as of this date, because even someone that is not very good at fps games can even do well from time to time."
9247,The graphics and the game itself surprises you from the first time you try it. I totally reccomend it.
9248,"game seems fun and cool tho don't like how there is no way to change the control's on the keyboard which annoy's me 
as of that mouse control kinda is not bad 
another thing is the Servers should have free for all battles 

do i reccomend this game ? not really if you enjoy the forced controls and odd system play CSGO or some other FPS"

9261,"eh, its alright"
9262,"I played this game from the start, when first time is published i played...I liked it first for, it's not like CSGO, no strategy, no planing, just shoot and try to kill someone. Time was passed, I got almost all achievements and I forgive developers for everyday chrasehes, so many bugs even now, year and more after game went out, but 2 days ago, I was very supprised when I loged up and see that someone report me for being good with sniper and I'm banned for 2 weeks. I submit raport for developers, and never got replay. That's also not only reason for me to uninstall this buggy game, I don't care if developers don't do they jobs and check gameplay of reported players so they can see who cheat and who not, that is mainely second reason. First is that this game, after almost 2 years crash every 2-3 games I play, developers also try to sell bullets (curency) for boxes, and you can buy box and use keys only with this bullets, that they cost minmum 5$. Those boxes was for free in the start, so now, developers trying to get money on this bugged game...
Uninstalling, and never install again, so many clones of this crap, and time to get back on good old CSGO..."
9263,"keeps crashing cant open game

9264,I love this game but cheaters community is growing in 2019. BattleEye is semi-useless.
9265,"Short review:
Its F2P not Pay to Win game.
Has player base. (Fast matchmaking)
A lot of gun fights.
Dont care about cheaters, you will meet few or none.

Description:
I dont know why many players give bad reviews to this game. (Especially those ones who played less than a half hour).
Im a former CoD2 and BF2, BF3 player and wanted to try out F2P FPS games. I tried many of them and this game is the best among them.
It is not about getting the best gear so you only will dominate the game. Its more a skill based game than some pay to win. A rookie in this game can simply carry the game with the basic gear that is a Rifle without any grenade. Anyway you have enough ingame currency for buying better weapons and you can get more ingame currencies only by starting the game once in a day. 

Its a CS:GO like game. Run faster with knife, going up the ladder straight not by climbing...

Some says there are a lot of cheaters. Honestly after 4 hours of playing I didnt meet any cheater.

Mainly I play 8vs8 TDM on different maps. These maps are small and you experience a lot of gun fights.
Thats why I like it and keep playing it.
The developers did a great job."
9266,game is not opening

9268,"This game seriously needs a report system. People are so blatantly cheating/hacking in the game that it's actually frustrating to play. Sure now and again you'll see some being removed because of hacking but like it works maybe 9% of the time which is pointless because the other 50% of Tom, Dick's and Harry's are still running around shooting people thru walls or using aimbots. Yes we know it's free to play doesn't mean you slack off and not give a crap about the rest of the players."
9269,"MORE AND MORE HACK,AND more and more ""nood""!

9273,Great game. Needs to be advertised more.
9274,3333
9275,"Pretty good game for what it is. Looking for a free shooter to play then go ahead. But there are a few cons.
1. Hackers: Some people are obviously hacking. Its like they know where I am. Almost makes Demolition and Competitive unplayable

2. Market: They dont allow you to sell certain skins in the market, which sucks. Sometimes if I get a rare skin, they dont let me sell it. EVEN if I got it from MARKET.  So its basically fucked, and people like to scam.

3. Bugs: Sometimes it kicks me out of games for no reason, or sometimes kicks me completely out of the application itself.

aside from that, something a little bit iffy is that the voice acting is cringy. Guys its a Free to Play game. If they cuck you its no surprise. Also don't bother with the DLC's.



I also seen some comments that the game is dead. In their server maybe. I have no problem finding games(Asia server)."
9276,It's just simply kinda worse made CS:GO. With less toxic community. Still fun tho.

hackers were still playing and the latency for sea players are high af and you can't even play it right now when it hit 120ms"
9283,I have played Black Squad for more than 50 hours and i found that the game is lacking a lot of things but the main thing is that the amount of hackers in the game is increasing day by day and also lack of replay in the matches . When you die you don't have any idea how the enemy player just killed you and so its a negative point in this game . Although the game is fun to play with your friends ^_^
9284,"I CANT PLAY THE GAME?

9285,sick
9286,This is awful in basically every possible way!
9287,"you REALLY need to fix the lag spike issue people are getting ingame, you honestly do not know how fucking frustrating it is to suddenly FREEZE during a 1v4 clutch when your team and their team is 7 to 7- also for those who said my PC is shit, well- for your information, I'm using a GTX980 and AMD FX 8320 8 core with 3.5Ghz and 8 GB RAM, so if anything- my spec should be above average on what most people used.
there's something wrong when on most days, your ping range from 28-50 something, but suddenly spike all the way to 100-150 on random moment.
my guess that it has something to do with the quick match system... it feel like god damn Russian roulette. 
the game is great and all, I would certain recommend it for those who have higher spec PC than me- but for the average joe, I say hold off on it for a while.
I'm giving a YES for recommend just for old time sake... it didn't happen back then."

Have fun playing this game!"
9292,"No ingame report system? That sucks big time, especially when you have a hacker problem.
Its ridiculous how many people are walling and not even trying to hide it. Like blatantly obvious but you can't do anything about it except leave and look for another room.

Head shot people just for them to spin round and 1 shot you. happens to many times to be over looked just gets irritating very quickly. also hate how they do the rent guns thing, In a fps game its ridiculous its only there for the reason of greed and for that i would never spend money on your game. ohh yeah youl get like 100 BS points when you level up but the guns you buy with the BS points are 70,000 BS points (wonder why they called them BullSh points hmmm) ."

9298,"Black Squad is my favorite FPS game on steam, and just clicked with me from my transition from console. I like the ability to aim down sights unlike some FPS games on PC. But overall the handling of the guns and gameplay feels really smooth. It isn't pay to win unlike other free to play games so it does feel really fair. There's a bunch of game modes you can play and I never have an issue finding a match. This game however does lack weapon customization but does have weapon variants and skins. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good/generic FPS game. If you like CSGO chances are you might just like Black Squad."

too small this  rate of gacha need too much pay to get weapon"
9309,"I've played better FPS games, this is basically:

8v8 matches on small maps where spawn killing is nearly possible.
Long wait times of over 2 minutes waiting to find a match with no server browser that I could find
Some guns come with free lasers and silencers which can be equipped and taken off at any time during game play, but other components such as the stock, barrel, and scopes can not be altered.
Game does not have a way to sprint with weapon in hand other than the knife.  

There are two blood modes, but blood can't be turned off entirely.
Earning currency to buy guns requires hundreds of hours, if not thousands of hours playing the game.
Gun fire sounds are sub par and could be improved.

Overall review: 3/10  Game needs work."
9310,meh
9311,it keeps saying disconnected from server every time i enter the game.
9312,this game is so good
9313,Kheilen nah.
9314,REVIEW
9315,"One of the shittest free-to-play games I've ever played if I'm being honest.
Couldn't even play an hour of this garbage.

Hit registration is awful, map layouts are a disgrace to mankind.
I can't even use military tactics with this shit, guns are cool though- but it's a garbage game."
9316,At first i thought it was porn hub but when it was at 40% I realized it was unplayable!
9317,Totally unplayable. Doesn't even launch.
9318,"The shooting feels good, but that's about where the positives end. All of the games I've played so far have been plagued with hackers. The maps I've played were all boring, small, and generic with only 2 or maybe 3 lanes. I only tried TDM so far, but each match quickly became a game of which team could get to the other team's spawn faster and try to camp there as long as possible. The issues that showed themselves in TDM quickly made me not even want to try any other modes available."
9319,LUND GAME HE BHENCHOD
9320,"I can't say the game is good but I can't say it's bad, i'm inbetween."
9321,":)

can u plz bring back founders package plzzzzzzzzz"
9322,Black Squad Is Trash
9323,yess
9324,Idk if it's just me but this game feels horrible. Most mobile games are a lot better. Somewhat playable ish kinda but not really. 2/10.
9325,"The game has clunky and all be it, hard to understand fighting mechanics. The thing I dislike the most about the game is that there seems to be little or no regulations on cheating. It seems as though this is a free to play version of call of duty. Also, there is no class system in gameplay as far as I can tell since starting to play."
9326,"POG
"
9327,Quick and simple... Very fun game to play
9328,good fps game
9329,"Crappy registration system, unbalanced (300-500+++ mmr point of difference), hackers, lagswitchers, wrong servers (either you ping either the enemies pinging) and in top of that the moderators are rarely useful and the developers just jerking off... if you play this game for fun real quick, it worth a try but don't expect it to be competitive, so sad this game had so much potential but it's so frustrating

UPDATE:

Now it's even worse after valofe bought the game basically they prefere creating uh.. I mean recycling their old skins rather than updating something useful.. this game has even more cheaters than before and more players are quitting. No this is not fun anymore no matter what mode you play, DO NOT play this game all you will feel is emptiness and frustration.. don't waste your time!"
9330,"It's fun, it's free."
9331,"This game is so boring, maps are terrible."
9332,succccccccccccccccccccc
9333,No sound. Sound works in every other game
9334,n o i c e n' h o t
9335,"Came back to this game see if it was still any good, no it didn't really improve, weapons are still low recoil, game is p2w, lots of bugs, weird stuff going on. game did not improve"
9336,its a very good game for the pc
9337,dsfsdf
9338,nice addictive game
9339,"Guns cost money, which is to be expected, but grenades run out after a amount of time and must be rebought to be used in-game. Recoil on guns is completely random and jumpy, making spraying almost completely useless outside of close range while making guns feel terrible to use."
9340,"Maybe there is some ""skill"" needed but otherwise there is no such thing as strategy in this game. For those looking for milsim games like Arma 3 or Squad, this is not for you. But if you love games like Point Blank or Counter Strike: Online, this might be for you."
9341,I've only ever been able to get one game going since I downloaded this game originally It's so dead it's ridiculous I no longer sit in empty lobbies for more than 10 minutes for any game regardless how good it is
9342,meh i have  a big dick:)
9343,"is really shhhhhhhlt
"
9344,"dead game
no recoil in weapons
too many low recoil guns.
south east servers filled with spraying bots. exmple archer fly koeast clans with no skills
just run and spray.
players jump and kills on low recoil guns
game totally dead on low recoils guns and servers"
9345,"The game was super cool and mooth in beta, now that its released it lags a lot making the game for a hardcore gamer pointless - you miss a lot of shots due to lag and its frustrating asf, quick matchmaking doesnt work, the bots are so flawed."
9346,bad poopoo
9347,nc game
9348,"8/10 ☆☆☆
Great game!"
9349,I've done some things to get this to run but it never did. I reinstalled it several times and it never worked.

9351,TO MUCH CHEATER NOT WORTH PLAYING
9352,Garbage cancerous community
9353,Crashes nonstop.  Game is okay if you can get it to finish a match.  Trash...move on.
9354,not good

9357,"Not running properly, game get interrupted with error ""Disconnected from server code 0x00000000"". After chatting with others, half of the users are having the same problem. It is the only steam game having such a big issue. Sad because game was good"
9358,SUPER DUPER AWESOME NOT RUSSIAN GAME GREAT.
9359,matchmaking fix..
9360,"f2p csgo copy, not worth the download"
9361,:D
9362,"I wondered why i only had 19 mins in this game.. After the tutorial, again, i now understand why."
9363,good game
9364,its a best fps game ever
9365,"Cant even play the goddamn game because RGBFusion2.0 is apparently a security violation even though that's Aorus's proprietary MB LED control software. Steam wont give me a refund. which is what I want due to playtime. In case anyone from Steam's devs ever see this as well, 2 hour limit for refunds? Do you know how much gameplay you can get in 2 hours, especially if the trouble begins after you start streaming the game (this happened to me before, still not refundable)? Not much. This is not a very user-friendly clause in the refund policy, and it certainly leads to trust issues, especially since this is a digital game, so you lose nothing by allowing us to return it (no shipping, codes, etc.) I'm real close to being done with Steam, and I'm done with this game and contacting devs directly if this isn't resolved within the week."
9366,Very good game has a lot of potential
9367,"What the fuck is this. 

Im confused, but i do enjoy."
9368,not for me but hay play it you mite like it

9374,It's fun
9375,it sucks
9376,would  just love to play but it doesnt repond ever soo dont play
9377,Alt aber ein gutes spiel
9378,"just no, bad csGo clone."
9379,TOESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
9380,"hackers all over. makes the game toxic. if you hate hackers. dont download it

worst security/support/tech ever

i dont know if the game has report button. but i saw a forum saying you need to send a ticket to report a hacker. no wonder this game is a hive of cheaters/hackers, wallhacks aimbots etc. name it and you got it, i see them since i started playing this game

8/16/2019 - i played the game tdm 8v8 4 of our team are either bot or afk while in our base slashing knife so server will not kick them and 1-2 people typing while in base telling enemies where we going. me and my son are the only fighting the enemy."
9381,used to play the game a lot now there is hackers and you can barley find a match
9382,"This game is garbage heres why

If you like cheaters everywhere then - download the game
If you like shooting a person and not one bullet hitting - download the game
If you like only skin updates and all the issues being ingnored - download the game
If you like being banned for being GOOD - download the game
If you like random recoil - download the game
If you like shiiit games - download the game

Just download CSGO or COD which are 100x better then this terriable game."
9383,they need to fix at least the facts we proct all the time on europe server as north american player -_-'
9384,discount CSGO 3.1/10
9385,"Good game, need more time and will be in top played games"
9386,"Wow

wish I could even PLAY THE GAME to give it an actual review. Game runs at like 20fps on all settings on my PC. No other game gives me this issue, just this game. Drivers are updated, settings are on very low, nothing. Just crappy framerate that makes it impossible to play this game."
9387,"Unplayable in 4K...
Could play only in window mode, as fullscreen window was set to Full HD only. Fullscreen had very strange lines all over the image.
Would recommend if that would be fixed, PLUS the HUD and menu should scale up when high resolution is selected. Because now I can only read things when using a magnifing glass"
9388,"hm, i've quit after the first minute of the tutorial. The basic behavior and graphics doesn't give me a nice feeling. Audio and sounds are basic and old... And that voice guiding you through the tutorial, its really not convincing. it almost ask's ""please, want you plant the c4.""..
Add some heavy voice, nearly screaming, giving some stress to show that its really important like your live is depending on it.. that would give a different experience.

But the music is nice.

Not rating it yet because its in a early stage i suppose."
9389,i have hugde problem with this game every time i download it try to play the game it wont let me. i really hope you guys that build this game fixed the issue
9390,its kinda shit.
9391,good good but laggy and starting sensitivity can be bad for neew players and so new pplayers will think that you cant change the sensitivity soo there stuck with bad sensittivity so but aside from that its awsesome and i recommend it
9392,"A modern military FPS that reminds you of CS;GO only it's free and isn't trying to knife your wallet every 5 seconds. Fast, fun gameplay and doesn't look half bad either. The event going on right now is super fun. Lots of weapon variety and good selection of maps to choose from in custom games. Daily rewards just for logging in. Could use better anti-cheat protection and *I think* it runs on DX9 but other than that I see no real issues here. Out of the 60 - 100 or so matches I've played I have only encountered a hacker in 1 match so I wouldn't worry about them too much.

All and all very enjoyable game, I highly recommend it. Reel me in NS Studio, ya got me hooked. Keep up the great work team."
9393,"Game is full of cheaters, aiming is awful. Not even worth the time to install when it's f2p."
9394,Bad Game. Is Not Terrible But I Wouldn't Play It Again At Least Not For Fun.
9395,this game is hard as shit
9396,is alright
9397,"Want to know a really good recipe for a bad game?

-Black Squad"
9398,"Fun way to spend time - maybe wouldn't play long term and as ""professionally"" as CS or something like that."
9399,"the game will not load what is the problem
"
9400,Good Stuff
9401,my girlfriend left me due to playing this game too much.
9402,"good game its like cod so fun i hit my snipes like a god
"
9403,"Wishes it was CS, but worse in every way."
9404,"I am not able to play the game. It doesn't start, the menu pops up and when I press ""play"" it just crashes and I'm not able to deleted the game in order to download the game again."
9405,TAC RELOAD! TAC RELOAD! TAC RELOAD! TAC RELOAD!
9406,bad game !!!
9407,not bad and not good game because if u play cod you can play it very well because its a little different aim in game but its good because after 2 or 3 day its gift u a knife u can sell it fo 3 or 4 dollar (good for some country) anyway don't buy it
9408,"This game is good, 

Its like Field of fire"
9409,its a shitty game with pay to win
9410,servers are empty.
9411,i reccomend
9412,"this game is very bad to play their is alot of bugs, i'm i high tier player i will tell u some bugs 
when u try to change anything in ur settings in the game the FPS will drop to 20 u need to restart the game so imagine u r playing rank and u change ur setting for some reason like me and u got 20 FPS after save the new setting and absolutely u will restart the game, when u restart the game u will stuck in loading screen for ever and u will get penalty only for playing this bad game, and i will tell u don't try to report any issue to the support they will do nothing, and don't try to report any cheater in the game cuz this will take a long time and they need a video to ban the cheater, so i don't recommended anymore 
Do not waste your time downloading this game_ (IGN:lOrD93DeViL)"
9413,"You know, I'd like to spend more time before reviewing this but the constant disconnects make it impossible."
9414,"Was fun for a little bit, but the competitive scene is dead in NA. killed the fun for us."
9415,This game use to be good but now its filled to the brim with cheaters.
9416,cool game
9417,"reported for being racist, nekker squad"
9418,"Blacksquad is fucking terrible, Pay to win, fucking anime girls everywhere, all the mechanics are broken, no effort whatsoever into this game.
0/10
worst game ever."
9419,"epic graphics, my life has changed after playing this... i have turned into a black squad boy"
9420,"Review : The updates are well done, however, feels like they are focusing on 1 type of group. (the very competitive players).  Game repeatedly re-release same skin over and skin again. Very limited expasion of Newers weapons (beside having same one redone with a new gun mod)"
9421,2meta4me
9422,"I sometimes play Black Squad when I'm sick and tired of Combat Arms, it has weapon skins and all that jazz but at least no one carries epic and legendary guns mopping the floor with their p2w garbage.

In short, this game is alright. Better than Combat Arms for sure. Not sure why people say this game is pay to win when every gun is the same except for the weapon skins. Just buy a default skin with gold or metals for perm and go to town.

Unless you have a weird hard on for skins I guess."
9423,"The game  was fun for about a week, but between the cheaters and the game trying to manipulate your win lose percentage it got old fast. Most games are extremely lop sided."
9424,Competitive is kind of a csgo knockoff but the game is quite fun
9425,its a Fucking Game
9426,"Used to be a god at this game but then kinda stopped playing. Upon a redownload of the game all I see is pay to win and hackers, devs clearly gave up. Probably will never return to this game. And good luck finding a match or let alone getting pass the launcher"
9427,Combat Arms in a Nutshell
9428,"Ein sehr gutes Spiel. macht sehr viel Spaß, und ich kann es wirklich nur empfehlen :)"
9429,it was amazing Game but the team are Lazy xD
9430,To be honest this was my fav first person multiplayer shooter
9431,My wife cheated on me.
9432,best game ever
9433,"PAY TO WIN, F U C K THIS GAME."
9434,2 Kelime:Oyun güzel.
9435,overall really good optimization is good for any computer but what i would really like is a oceania server because im getting kicked from games because of my ping
9436,blacc is bacc
9437,It Was A Better Game When It Was Giving Free Marketable Items...
9438,"Good Game, but it doesnt feel good for me.
the gunplay feels kinda weak and the UI is terrible in my opinion.
The devs should simplify the UI for  better and more accesible experience. it just feels like a mess
also i would love to be able to customize my weapons and that would affect the recoil and such
Still, i will reccomend this game because it probably is just not my cup of tea
"
9439,TACTICAL RELOAD
9440,"VERY Cool
"
9441,"I would definitely not recommend if you are a person who looks for ""REAL DAMAGE GAME"" because you would want to divide your keyboard into 2."
9442,good game :D
9443,Cheap game :)
9444,its boring
9445,this is the shittiest free-to-play game with pay-to-win mechanics. fuck the dev
9446,5/10 Players here Hacker nice protection guard. cant play anymore just 0 this game is daed now.
9447,"Boring, plain-looking and somehow still unoptimized. This game is poorly put together, and it shows. Even the main menu lags behind at 720p. If you have a beefy rig, don't even consider this game, rumor is it handles low-end PCs better than high-end PCs. I guess the developers themselves have low-end PCs..."
9448,Needs a better reporting system . The game is overall very good and fun.
9449,"Game is similar to CS GO  with way you move there is lots of weapons . I wish there is more maps .Also that developers put 2v2 Competitive ,put a bit more options about maps  ( so you could play 1 or random map) and vote(when you have some one who you dont want in your team) when you play competitive . Game is fun and good .But continue to develop use CS GO and Warface as your platform ."
9450,Not bad
9451,Skin shop wrapped around a garbage game.
9452,"I like this better than CSGO. However, it's a bit tedious. It takes so many hours to raise your level before you can play competitive / rank games. But despite that, everything else is two thumbs up for me. I especially like it because there are less cheaters in the game."
9453,TAC RELOAD
9454,"I have racked up a ton of hours in this game. This was my first game on steam and it was quite fun. The game had a ton of potential, but instead of getting better with age it went downhill over time. Many of the friends I have today came from this game and I will always remember that. A year or so ago I might have recommended this game, but I can't bring myself to do such now a days knowing the state of the game. It is like the developers stopped caring about the game. There are many known glitches and bug issues that continuously go unfixed. One of the biggest issue I personally have found is that you teleport during the game. I play many first person shooters and never experience that. I know the fault is within the game and not my computer (though the discord mods may try to say otherwise to the community). The NA scene is essentially dead with only EU playing at this point. Quick Matches are absolutely terrible after the developers changed the way they work and servers. You'll never find a clan match and good luck getting into comp. The game started dying ages ago and it is kinda sad after all the time I put into the game. The organized tournaments were good, but only for a while. I can't recommend the game in its current state (I would have back when I first played it and grinded it, but it is not currently a good game). I myself do not play it anymore unless a few friends get together for old times sake."
9455,"Absolutely terrible F2P shooter.

Eg. you start tutorial and are unable to invert mouse or re-bind any of the keys. English translations are bad.

Just don't."
9456,Very fun game some times.
9457,"Fairly fun, but plenty of things in this game make no sense, like the range and damage of certain guns, and how people always seem to end up at 1HP no matter how much damage the final shot does.
Snipers are overpowered and the progression is far too slow.
Also, why THE FU*CK is the spawnkill protection the way it is? You can shoot while being completely invulnerable. It's broken."
9458,"Not an Enjoyable experience at all. Lag is bad no regional servers so everyones 150+ ping (with a few people here and there with decent ping), Que times are to long for no reason (with how many people are supposedly playing) and the gun play is very lack luster. No Bullet drop, any AK variant or of same caliber has nonsense recoil or the AR platforms have next to no recoil, Headshots or you're basically doing no damage. The Snipers are almost all 1 shot kills regardless of where you hit. Micro Transactions like crazy (regardless of if you have to pay or not there are 5 DIFFERENT CURRENCIES FOR 1 FPS GAME 3 of which are Paid Currency). There is no Gun Customization, you get whats on the gun and thats it (positive though, all weapons are Perm when you buy them no renting bs)

this game is the type of game that if you have LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE TO DO, go for it and waste a few hours. IT IS NOT A QUALITY FPS

in all if there was more attention to servers, and SOME sort of actual gun play at all it would be worth it."
9459,Nacchan Squad!
9460,ok..fun
9461,is ok
9462,This game is so many pro's
9463,"horrible gameplay, horrible control, endless microtransactions"
9464,very good quality game for f2p
9465,hella of fun play it all day if i could
9466,I need a job
9467,Nice game.
9468,many cheater this game and more bug shot in game. 2/10 score
9469,"huij
,"
9470,Cant play on any servers cause of (high) ping
9471,"a lot of hackers, honestly, the nuber of hackers are insanely high in this game. it looks like dev just dont bann them, or they dont let Battleye do the job.
there's some free hack I guess, because in this game, I found more hackers then in non-prime csgo.
or maybe devs just abandoned the game.. and this is the reason why so many hackers playing with this game"
9472,"Way back in 2018, the game used to be popular and fun. Playing matches with friends was a great way to spend my time. There were weapons to work towards unlocking in the medal shop, and I even spent a bit of money on some of the first release packages; things like the AK12, AK47, SR15, and M4 Custom release packages as well as the first DLC they ever released for a lot of starting guns.

Taking a look now, the game is dead (at least in NA). All the cool players who used to play have left the game. Only gamemodes you can Quick Play are TDM, 8v8, 16v16, and occasionally a 5v5. Most of the times I get these matches, they're filled with SA players with super high ping. Apparently servers were merged? Anyway, give up on trying to find a competitive match, at no point was I able to find a match, no matter how long I waited.

Now they're shoveling out currency that was hard to come by in the past, for winning 1 match in different modes (some of which you'll be lucky to find a match for regardless). Not worth putting any time or money into in my opinion, and this is coming from a former decent spender.

Shame. Maybe if they manage to get more players, and deal with what I'm hearing from current active users is a huge anti-cheat problem, then maybe I'll come back someday."
9473,"Cheater Everywhere AND THIS GAME NO HAVE VAC BAN
CAUSE THIS GAME SUCKS!!!"
9474,"Faster paced gameplay, several different game modes including a competitive scene, and a nice a respectful community. Game uses BattlEye anti-cheat; I haven't encountered any cheaters to my knowledge. Just dropped in on a seasonal summer event and was already able to win a permanent weapon within 12 hours of playing (and roughly 10-20 crates), so I believe the loot boxes have a good rate for permanent weapons. There isn't an excess of gameplay mechanics making it simple and clean. Maps tend to be smaller which I personally enjoy. I'll definitely keep playing this game!"
9475,Pay to win
9476,"face paced , 
but much toxic player btw

but overall fun to be played
"
9477,"I always get updates that increasingly lower the FPS, this game is already unplayable of what I had 120 fps now I have 60 and from one moment to another it drops to 15, it is one last I had put money in the I feel cheated."
9478,hmm
9479,Was fun
9480,"Most shittiest game I've ever played.

The tutorial of this game is worst than Valve's Dota 2 and CS:GO combined. Its a freaking Battlefield and Call of Duty Ripoff and a CF ripoff and its really, really bad.

It was filled with hacks bypassing BattleEye (BattleEye is literally Mcafee), Its a dumb pay to win game, and the controls are default to be the most uncontrolable one like THE SENSITIVITY IS TOO SLOW AND YOU HAVE TO GO TO SETTINGS AND INCREASE IT.

The shop of this game is literally pay to win, if you don't buy anything fast before the 50% discount is gone you aren't be able to counter the enemy team. The shop is also confusing and WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A CRATE THAT HAS A 30 DAYS TRIAL SKIN?! THAT'S A WASTE OF INGAME CURRENCY.

Waste your time on CS:GO than this trash.
This trash also autoconnects me to other region because it doesn't have an Asian Server.
Also your theme song sucks ass."
9481,game has a few ups and downs no1 hackers no2 matchmaking no3 game took atleast 20 mins to start.Dont waste ur time go play csgo or sumth
9482,not fun
9483,pre good
9484,gg
9485,ITS SO DOPE GAME !!!!!!
9486,just dont step on the glass
9487,just dont play its a waste of time and money if you spend money
9488,GG
9489,Nice
9490,game is dead
9491,rather epic
9492,Nice one
9493," Devs don't care about their Players, all they care for is Money.

"
9494,"just play and no pay, some cheaters there but it cant affect you too much and it can run in my potato pc so 8/10"
9495,"bad setting options...
bad control options...
bad igame mechanics...
it's just a bad game."
9496,Its too bad its got so many glitches
9497,Nice fps game
9498,"Despite I like this game at some point. 'many' things make this game worst

- Market and Trading Policy is obviously joke, If you got Rifle/Knife from Lootbox you can't give it to someone / sell it on market. Im not big fan of lootbox but this make me soo badly.
- Banned System is bad, Cheater doesnt got ban. Support always answer 'We will investigate' but no one got banned. How can people with 0.9 KD kill 30 ppl on every round 
competiton without getting banned >:(

I recommended this game only if you play it more often, not as active player until dev fix this game"
9499,"I used to enjoy this game but now its filled with wallhackers or aimbotters. 
Wow! people need to cheat just to feel better about them selves. Thats just sad.
On top of that these amateur developers never heard of an report option either from where they're coming from."
9500,Noice game
9501,Thanks For This Game
9502,nice xD
9503,hey steam please fixed your server sea
9504,Cheaters... so many cheaters and the devs don't do anything about it.
9505,good game it is just a replica of counter strike global offensive - aka - csgo  just a rip off version
9506,dont get it it freezez laptops witha black screen and wont let you restart the laptop 0/10
9507,"亲爱的制作团队，我是一个游戏老玩家，非常的爱这个游戏。我想提出一个建议，检视武器的功能，可以在游戏开始前5秒进行开放使用吗，因为在游戏进行中的时候很少用检视武器，因为会影响游戏和枪战时的操作。如果游戏开始前5秒不能进行检视武器，那这个功能将毫无意义。游戏开始前5秒开放检视武器功能，谢谢！BlackSquad，钟爱一生！！！
Dear production team, I am a veteran gamer and love this game very much. I would like to make a suggestion that the function of inspecting weapons can be used openly five seconds before the start of the game, because inspecting weapons are seldom used during the game, because it will affect the operation of the game and gun battle. If the weapon cannot be inspected five seconds before the game starts, the function will be meaningless. Five seconds before the game starts, open to view weapon functions. Thank you! BlackSquad, love life!!!"
9508,Dope Game
9509,nice game XD
9510,"Played one game and got stomped by the other team, hard. Getting killed through walls, headshot across the map the instant I'm seen, etc. Lots of suspected cheating activity. Forums are on fire about not banning folks, known cheats rampant and nothing seems to be done about it. So I figure there were at least 3 hacks in that game. Poor first impression, uninstall. Could be a great game and I did enjoy it until I put two and two together and realized there were hacks and not just me being crazy."
9511,"played this game a few times but it feels to easy, always at top of leaderboard without any effort. good game but gets boring quickly since there is no real competition for me."
9512,"they should reduce hacker
"
9513,"I used to play this game a lot. I had spent around 1000 hours, including my other accounts, to this game. I participeted in clan battles and competitive games and had lots of fun too, but these days are in the past now. Game is good for real. However, Developers are trying their best to kill this game and thus it is almost dead. Devs have never  cared about their players. All they have done is their badass looking skins. ( Well i gotta admit that their skins are good looking. )

about competitive; There are lots of hackers and developers do nothing abot this issue. You'll see hackers a lot, especially on high ranks & elo. I had around 60% - 65% win rate on each competitive seasons but i didnt go further than Lion as i knew i would see cheaters up in cobra elo.

Online player; None. Basically none. They had 9k or 10k before and now the game has around 3k or 2k active players. This remaining number of players is also on decrease. You think developers do anything? Let me tell you, NO!

Updates; Nothing but skins. Well, yea, they sometimes add re-designed same weapons or little bit buffed versions and maps time to time. ( Btw, these maps are not low-end pc friendly.) They also mixed all servers couple months ago. ( Maybe more or less i dont remember exactly.) If you wanna play custom match, it's fine you wont have much issue about this. However, when it comes to the competitive side it is completely random. You will have lots of no reg issue due to high pings. ( Well yea there is also no reg problem. They have done nothing about this problem so far and not planning to fix it.) 

Matchmaking; Worst. Either your team or opponent team is sucks and lose as soon as possible. It is likely to happen like this 7 of 10 games. The mm i talked about was competitive mm. We also have quick match mm, or we dont. It basically depends on your in game level. If you have decent 5-man-team, you will likely to win your most of games. If you have smurf in your team, you will win all games for sure because matchmaking will give you low level players as you have low level in your team.


This game could have been fixed and could go back to it's good old times. However, it's developlers F#cked up everything and keep screwing things. I lost my all hopes about this game months ago but i kept playing as i had friends to play with but i had to stop playing as my exam were too close. I passed and done with exam but i dont have any interest to play this game anymore and i definietly not recommend to anyone. The game has almost no blood in it's veins."
9514,its ok
9515,Best potential game but potential dies when there are from 5 people 3 hackers so.....
9516,goodf
9517,"really good game, good graphics, and audio is ""above par"", its pretty good but could be better. overall really fun game"
9518,It's Good
9519,i played this game while eating cheerio yogurt. Game is ok. Yogurt yummy.
9520,guns are weird but game ok?
9521,nice game insine
9522,"It's a great game but there's way too much element with in, making the game it self overwhelming, on both weapon and other special stuff.

it's not a bad game, it's just too much for my brain"
9523,good game
9524,"First the Upside and Downsides to this game:

Pros:

1. Multiple Choice Weapons

2. Can have solo matches against the A.I. to fine tune your skill in private

3.Plenty of maps so far

4. Clan and Clan War system for PvP fans

5. Great graphics as long as you have the hardware to handle the demand


Cons:

1. Needs more game mode variety, currently only has;
Team Deathmatch
Survival (Team Last Man Standing basically)
Search and Destroy
Destruction (SnD Variant, destroy the other teams crates)
Assassination (Classic VIP mode, protect or assassinate the target)
Clan Match

2. A.I. is needs to be dumbed down, gameplay too closely resembles playing Human hackers (Bots feel like they have Aimbot and Chams)

3. Hefty Cash/Gold grind in order to buy the in-game weapons with basic game currency

4. Cash Shop (Not really a con, but will probably anger the more poorer fanbase that can't buy stuff right off the back with real cash) I personally dont mind it because I love spending real cash on games that I feel are well taken care of and supported by the Devs.


All in all? I'd give it a 4/5 only because of the A.I. issue, but other than that, I totally recommend this game. 

Game Tip: When playing the A.I. by yourself in order to learn the maps, I recommend doing a 1v1 match with a friend instead so you can at least explore without getting spawn camped."
9525,bruh
9526,"awful game, the controls are absolute shit, why would i sprint by pressing my mouse wheel, shitty maps too"
9527,nice game
9528,"Whats the deal with making it that women have to wear fucking basically bikini's in fucking combat, gets on my nerves when i see females wearing this IN COMBAT, short shorts, high heels massive titties, downright ruined, while the men, where kevlar armor, helmets, REAL uniforms, semi realistic, is what i would like, they do it because of the money, and thats all they care about. At least  make them look like PMC'S and not ripped from some hentai."
9529,nice game
9530,"Pretty much the worst FPS game you can ever find. If you want to cheat or just play with one of the worst communities in the universe, play this game. So many cheaters, you can't report easily, you have to go a site or some stupid thing...

Devs are working on more skins rather than fixing the game. Any other FPS would be fine, unless you like to cheat.

EDIT: I also need to mention that I was a fan of this game, really, I played it with friends about 1-2 years ago and it was fun, but now all the glitches and cheaters doesn't make it fun at all even with friends."
9531,"P2W
Hackers
"
9532,YUCKH
9533,"its freezing for me a lot and i dont know why but other than that its a great game
"
9534,fucking aids dont even bother to download
9535,"You spend more time looking for a match than you do playing a game sometimes. They have several game modes you just don't know which one will take the least to hop on. I like the gameplay but it's not worth the long waits. Also, I normally get 60-80 ping on most games but on this game I never get below 160 ping and other people usually have an abnormally high ping as well. So who knows where the servers are located. I'll delete the game for now but I may try it again in the future."
9536,"Black Squad is a good free FPS game. Its like CS:GO But a little less fancy since it not as big
."
9537,"I have no F.R.I.E.N.D.S. XD

-> Will update soon 💯"
9538,csgo on crack
9539,"Good alternative for CSGO..
Also you need to grind a lot form in-game money."
9540,Weapons so good and really can play free and have fun
9541,Very Good Game!¨!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9542,"trash game, so many cheaters and devs do nothing to ban, they are busy releasing gay RGB skin which do not know who the fuck is enemies and who is the allies? hope this game die soon"
9543,Welcome
9544,can i get a refund?
9545,"very fun game, its easy to learn but hard to master. fast paced game play similar to something like battlefield. it is worth the download."
9546,"It's a pretty decent game. I like the way it works for the most part. The physics could use a little work, and the graphics could be better, but it's a good game."
9547,good game!!!!
9548,yes
9549,It's good
9550,Wont load. So..............................
9551,very nice for bad pc
9552,Do i have to be black to play?
9553,"Its Good Game. If Wanna Get In Games Like COD But Don't Have The Cash I Would Recommend It

What I Like Is That For Free Game It Has Detail. Story. Good Mechanics

What I Dislike Is The Game Is To Easy And You Can Level Up Quick. Get Loot To Quickly If You Could Lower Down The Experince Rate That Would Be Fantastic Because There's Level 100. 78 Going Around And It Hard To Get Kill

But After That Is Amazing"
9554,"It's like CS:GO and rainbow six siege having a baby, but the child is a veetard..."
9555,TRASH
9556,Trash game
9557,<3
9558,good for all system . best fps for me :D
9559,"I've been playing this game for quite some time, and have come to love it. Sure this game has some issues, but what game doesn't?

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list][*]Fast paced shooter ~ This game is very fast paced. You're constantly on the move killing enemy players. Keeps the fun factor in check for me personally.
[*]One Tap Guns ~ I mean this is pretty self explanatory. This game offers a wide variety of guns that can one tap players in the head. 
[*]Competitive Play ~ Black Squad offers a competitive match making system that allows you to rank up through the ladder. Perfect for people that are into being competitive.
[*]Variety of Game Modes ~ This game offers many different game modes like TDM, Demolition, Capture The Flag, and others that can be played through custom matches.[/list]

This game has a lot of pros which makes it so much fun. There isn't really a dull moment if you try to experience everything the game has to offer. That being said, every game has its pros and cons.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list][*]Server Instability ~ A while back the developers decides to merge the servers together, not allowing players to pick a specific region. This severely hurt the game as a whole, putting people from different regions into a high ping environment. You can't go a game or two without having over 100 latency which affects hit reg and other things. 
[*]Hackers ~ While I haven't personally experience hackers, they're very prevalent in competitive play. Some people see hackers almost every 1 in 3 competitive games at high tier play.
[*]Loot Boxes ~ Not the biggest fan of loot boxes, but most of the rare skins come from loot boxes. Luckily there is a steam market place for this game where you can buy them fairly cheap.[/list]

The two main issues that plague this game are the server instability and hacking infestation in competitive play. One of these problems can be solved with a moderation of competitive matches. Even if it comes down to players being able to watch replays and judge the hackers for themselves.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Overall this game is a lot of fun. If you're looking for a similar shooter to that of Counter-Strike, this game really brings that out. It has great action combat, headshots feel so satisfying, and winning makes you feel good. This game is for you. If a few hackers and server instability is a turn off for you, then this game isn't for you."
9560,if this game was able to use a controller than the key board i would recommend this game.
9561,meh. game is not good but not bad just meh.
9562,Terrible Game! Do not buy. Do not play!
9563,ok its good yaaaah skrrrt brrrpp gucci hey not this that song is copyrighted

9567,"it was ok
"
9568,im gay
9569,i dont get why people are saying this is a good game. its pretty sorry spray and pray. i could literally run out holding the trigger and get HS everytime. feels like 2 shot kill with every gun but very arcade like. im guessing most positive reviews are from overseas where theyre riddled with this trash type game
9570,"Good FPS game, I enjoyed it"
9571,THIS GAME HAS SO MANY WALL HACKERS AND AIMBOTERS ITS JUST PATHETIC SAD CAUSE ITS  NOT BAD SHOOTER JUST NO WAY OF GETTING RID OF THEM ONCE THEY JOIN YOUR GAME.
9572,"Kept having trouble getting into Red Crucible, so I searched about for another free to play multiplayer-shooter... And found Black Squad.  It is soooooo much better than Red Crucible, I don't even know why anyone would play the one instead of the other.  It's fun as heck, better graphics, no where near as gliche, and almost hacker free; and the developers/mods are very responsive and friendly even (completely opposite of RC)."
9573,"Black Squad is a generic free to play PVP FPS lobby game. It worked on Win10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok, was understandable. Has a tutorial mission. Has anti-cheat system on it, but still plaqued with hackers. Does have some different items for each classes."
9574,"Found this game randomly
And stay for the fun... But, there is no improvement what soever... This game has a lot of potential but the dev throw it away... Still play it sometimes hoping for more upgrade in the future..."
9575,"Needless to say, I keep her in check
She was all bad-bad, nevertheless (yeah)
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (wreck)
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (wreck)

Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check
She was all bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck

Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip


Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse

She wanna ride me like a cruise
And I'm not tryna lose

Then you're left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're a sunflower"
9576,"Game used to be good back in S1 & S2. Cheaters killed the game for a time in S3 & S4. S5 I didn't play. S6 seemed to be good. S7 Valofe took over from NS Studio and this is when the game in my opinion became really bad. Apart from my no life, I've used to play the game every day in every free minute, on different Accounts, what probably gave me a total of 3000+ hours, a lot of joy and a lot of friendships. Now there's nothing left.

Beside the regular problems in this game (no regs, unstable servers, bugs, cheaters, matchmaking), Valofe created more problems.

-Closing the Competitive Queue as only SoloQ and tending for Clan Wars as 5, what seemed to be a great idea but on the other hand, there's not enough players anymore. You would find the same Clans all the time. It should've been atleast Solo/Duo. Because most of us, rather play with friends. Most of the pro players left the game a while ago. So Comp is just a gamble about teammates now a days anyway.

-There's no Tournaments anymore.

-They closed the Steam market, what by any means will benefit for Valofe, but not for the players. Good skins now a days, you can just buy with money. You can see, Valofe is literally trying to get as much money as possible out of the game BUT is not going to listen to the community or trying to save the game.

The game still has around 2k as playerbase, simply because it's full of players, enjoying playing Quick matches for fun or with friends and thats it. Or yeah, the other no lifers like I used to be, still playing this game in hope it would become better.

If this is still not enough to stop you from playing this game, then be prepared to get called out as Cheater, just by doing few prefires or lucky Shots and eventually get banned for it. Community is another gamble. You can find a lot of nice people and make great friendships with them, but you will also find players being super toxic and spreading rumors around, faster than a village could.

I wasn't an angle in this game, I've done few mistakes, forsure. And don't get me wrong, the game itself is good. Unfortunately it's in the wrong hands. I really hope Valofe will wake up and make the game great again, for all the people who loved it."
9577,"You guys killed the marketplace for this game, now the game is suffering a slowly death. Good job!"
9578,let me be clear the only thing i hate from this game is stuttering.... oh and also false report that might get u banned... and cheaters... and-
9579,The most reta**ed game ever! Won't play this s**t anymore. The worst 100 hours in my life.
9580,Better than CS:GO
9581,one of the best free to play games out there.
9582,racist game name smh
9583,this game is one of my fav game <3 gooooddddddddddddddddddddddd
9584,"I do like to inform this within the new updates about Auto-kick ingame system.
Auto-kick ping cap had set to /low /moderate which whom was got kicked of getting high ping. Since you get auto-kicked, sadly your Records will counted as 'Defeat' (same as Auto-kicked, Disconnected, Voted-kick which are counted as well as defeat).

Besides, not every players have such a good ping.
Think about it, when you wanna enjoy the match, but every room has checked auto-kick setting which is hard to have fun in each game match.

Dont get me wrong, i'm veteran player & i have even played this game since officially released on main website in the year of 2018.

In 2022, I would not recommend people to play this game anymore only due to poor ping. it's gonna bring so much frustation and depression with auto-kicked when you have experienced unexpectedly ping spikes.

If you want to play with more freedom due to poor ping. Go get battlefield on sale, play the game on dice servers. Sure, you'll get matched your ping by your own action in the actual gameplay."
9585,I don't like the controls. You can't even run and is full of campers.
9586,"Gameplay is average; a very generic fps free to play. Running no less than 60 fps and there is still a ton of stuttering especially when trying to shoot your enemy; that's a game killer for me. 
So a big Nope from me."
9587,yeah its a good game and yeah i have allmost 0 hours on it
9588,"cant find any matches
"
9589,"If you have an AMD/RX-580 graphics card dont install, you will actually get bsod everytime you start it up kind of weird."
9590,Good game to scratch your Cod itch till October.
9591,"Decent first person shooter game. Once you get used to it's shooting mechanics, it becomes really enjoyable to play. Team Deathmatch mode is extremely boring, Demolition (aka plant and defuse the bomb), on the other hand, feels very like Counter-Strike. I can recommend this game to anyone who is looking for simple and fast multiplayer game."
9592,Perfect Game
9593,SO FUCKIN AWESOME FREE TO PLAY FPS....
9594,"I honestly cannot remember anything about this game, but from what I can, it's sort of half-retarded."
9595,cool game
9596,"Black Squad is the type of game to be very annoying and fun at the same time, for instants the game has a problem right now where the is a lot of no reg (Hitting someone but not registering) but also the game is just fun in general well to me at least, there are some who despise this game for some reason. But all in all i think this game is a great game and you should just try it out and just relax when you play it. 

I give this game a rating (8.6/10)"
9597,when you're vac ban on csgo
9598,no!
9599,<3
9600,"Pay to win and gambling: Most items (like guns), if not all, you get in the crates from actually playing, are time limited. Only by paying real money (tm) you can keep them. 
So this game is more like a trial or a drug dealer's 'first hit' (the first hit is always free).

I just checked and the same is true for the 'welcome package' giveaway: the items (guns etc.) are limited to a 30 days trial. See screenshot: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1800140573 It includes, for example, the DESERTEAGLE 50AE which can kill an enemy with a single headshot (it does 31 more damage than the regular pistol, which cannot).

Or this 7 day hand grenade you get for completing the tutorial: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1800150352 - please note that you do not have any grenades by default. That's right, you have to grind to get a 7 day hand grenade.

The game is like an advertisement at all times: it displays a ticker below the main menu which shows when people make p2w purchases, and who. I saw people buy Random Gold Lootboxes, which contain random p2w items (=gambling). Random Boxes can be bought with ""Bullets"" which is the premium currency in Black Squad and can only be obtained by buying them with real money. They give BS Coins which can be used to purchase weapons directly.

The game itself is extremely generic. The default weapons are uninspired (probably to make you excited to pay for DLC weapons), and maps are super unoriginal ('Chemical Factory', 'Castle') and small (like 50 by 50 meters). 

It also has some much-abused bugs: the game stupidly shows the name of the player your mouse is over at all times, even when they are behind non-solid cover. This means that you can shoot at players you can't even see because their name shows up when they are, for example, behind a flag you cannot see through. 

So, other players can shoot you through cover too, even if they had no way to know you were there if not for this 'bug'. 

There are other bugs too, like bringing up the sniper scope after walking around, sometimes requires two to three right mouse clicks.

*Pay to win is any system where a player can purchase something that is not superficial or cosmetic."

9641,"This game is a hackers paradise, specially in ranked mode. The staff does not care and dont plan on banning anyone. They promoted one of the most well known hackers to admin. The registry is garbage, the player base is EU Asia not many American players. There is no American server. You will be no regging everyone and net code is beyond redemption. If you play this game you are choosing to add stress in your life. Burn the game, report the devs. Nothing will get done in this game. Hackers are EVERYWHERE. Ive played since day 1 till now. There is no hope for this game."
9642,"Clunky, almost like someone made a moblie FPS game for a phone and ported it to PC. It looks and plays like a bad remake of CSGO. Controls are weird and unconventional, and in summary it really just leaves a bad taste in my mouth."

9664,Dead Game. It's been dead since 2013. don't be a id10t  and fall for the fake reviews!
9665,"3000+ hours in Black Squad,and i don't recommend playing this game. Devs don't care about cheaters.
Don't even try to play competitive,there are like 30+ wallhackers and minimum 10 aimbots.
If you're trying to report a player,devs need like 2 months,to check the player and ban him. But it's only if he's aimbot.
Wallhackers never get banned in black squad.
Noregs-  there are always no-registered shots,and they won't fix this. If your ping is 100+ You will get like 10 + noregs every game.
Updates - always the same updates,skins,skins,sometimes new guns,new map.. New maps and weapons always bad. 
NA servers are dead. There is only Left EU AND ASIA. if you're NA player,you gonna play in EU server with 120+ ping.
About competitive - there are always the same rewards,same calling cards. If you're top100 you will get different knife,but same calling cards with same text,everything same..
I reported like 5 cheaters,but no one got banned,because they answer me "" We will investigate the player further""  After 3 months,player still not banned and using clearly wallhack.
It was the trading system , everyone traded the skins,it was amazing! But they removed the trading system.
Good luck everyone! have a great day!"
9666,"have been waiting for a long time to be released on steam, THIS SHIET WILL ELIMINATE THOSE FILTHY CHEATERS OFC! :D

11/10 would play again here

but it has a lot of hackers when i played

it is free"
9676,"A good Fast Paced Game ,lots of skins available,headshots feel great
Experienced a lot of latency issues even though my isp provided package is over150Mbps ,probably server related

9707,Hi
9708,This is one of the saddest FPS games I've played. The settings are trash when you first start out. The mouse cuts out constantly if you put the sensitivity high. Tutorial is the most forced thing I've ever seen and they swear a lot to try to act edgy and cool to get the attention of kids. I played this for around 10 minutes and immediately disliked it. The download is too long for a game like this and doesn't deserve to be downloaded.
9709,good game
9710,amazing
9711,good game
9712,so bad

9747,summer sale eek
9748,"thx for wasting my time, I can't even play because your anti-cheat =prevent me from playing and close the game while i'm not even start the game and not even cheat."
9749,"The game has a 4-6 K players active per day so it's not that bad except some graphics textures ( like for cars, it looks like i am playing GTA SA)"
9750,Best Fps game. BUT have so many bugs glitches And bad Teammaking. Gamplay Maps and everything is best. JUST need imrpovements.
9751,hi  i am a new player in the game and love game i have played it ever day for a week and i just want to help you with some maps can you make the maps more arme like and make the skin like little bit arme
9752,"Problem with the game

1. bad match making system, often you will get matched with higher ranking individuals.
2. sometimes you might get 2v1 in 2v2 demolition.
3. hackers and cheaters.
4. you might have to wait hour for competitive match to begin and end up getting qued with higher ranks.

Play CSGO, better game."

9768,less players now :(
9769,Its a good game.
9770,if its free its for me
9771,"I'm a bit new to the game but it looks extremely fun! Especially the class based gamemode. The guns and kills feel amazing. My only issue is that you have to rent smoke bombs and grenades and you can't just have them permanently. Other than that, the game is pretty fun. If we had permanent grenades and smoke bombs then the game would definitely do much better."
9772,not bad not bad LOL

9783,Cheating is pretty rampant through the game.  The first two matches I was being headshot the instant I came around corners.
9784,Nice game with long events with skins giveaway but waiting time is kinda long for games.Overall is a great free game.
9785,Most satisfying fps shooter i have ever played.
9786,hey did you guys get rid of the AI survival or whatever? if so why? anyways GREATTTTTTT GAMMEEEE!!!!!!
9787,The game is very bad due to lack of attention developers and no players you can find him.
9788,bruh
9789,[spoiler] It's ok. [/spoiler]
9790,"1) HACKERS ALL AROUND
2) DEVS HAVN'T FIXED THE BASIC MECHANICS OF THE GAME
3) NO VOICE-CHAT
4) NO CUSTOM SCOPES
5) NO INNOVATION OF MECHANICS OR GAME DESIGN

WHAT YOU GET IS SLICK SKINS EVERY UPDATE AND A LIE THAT ANTI-CHEAT IS FIXED.. BUT THAT'S HYPOCRACY & I SEE DEVELOPERS HAVN'T FIXED THE 0x0000 ERROR SINCE 3 YEARS AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING NOW IS MAKING AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY COULD FROM THE GAME [THOUGH IT'S ALREADY DEAD]




Thank You"

9826,"Jogo bom, mas infelizmente mal administrado. Falido. Acabou"
9827,Very good game But sad not a lot of people are playing :)
9828,Very good game
9829,"It's a simple to the point Counter Strike type f2p FPS made with comp in mind. There's literally no P2W in the game. All guns are bought with in game currency that you earn by playing, leveling (You'll get a lot at the start), and logging on, and there's two main types that are earned slightly differently. Coins can be earned by the match, medals are earned purely through levels and logins. Medals can buy the fancy guns, but the coin ones are more than good enough. Like I mentioned, early on you'll amass a lot of both of these currencies, so feel free to buy things. Also, events love to give free cheap skins out, so you could always save them in hopes that you can get the gun you want through these. The C2 Bren was given to me this way :D

The controls feel good and responsive, and the hits feel impactful. The only real issue I have are the grenade launchers that so many guns have and that feel very cheap and spammy. Also the lack of NA TDM people, but that's not the fault of the game, just there not being as many NA people as there were at launch. Doesn't mean you shouldn't give this a try though."
9830,"It's an amzing game , but it's getting bad with time :("
9831,not so bad not so good
9832,"Honestly this is just better than CS:GO in my opinion. It's like if you took out the fanboys of CS:GO and just had the smooth gameplay and with the game loot system of guns, you would have Black Squad."
9833,"Good  game but will be better when all bugs are fix i.e FPS drops, No registers on bullets etc."
9834,it wont let me play right now

9883,"Top of my list favorite f2p FPS right now. Fun arcade shooter feel, everything is unlockable in game with some time and grinding, no p2w guns. Matchmaking is decent, if it had a bigger playerbase would definitely play much more, and possibly comp."

9898,"macht sehr viel Spaß da es an sich sehr an CS:GO richtet, was nicht verkehrt ist. Skins sind vorhanden bringen aber keinen Vorteil was schon so sein sollte in einem competitive Shooter. Hacker sind aber laut Community dennoch ein Problem.

8/10 hoff ich konnte helfen"
9899,"it's fun game, in the past
but now, cheaters everywhere
"
9900,"Fun with decent graphics. Bit slow on updates that are not skins. NA server kinda dead, but you can play on other servers. They changed up the market system, so be wary of that. I still recommend giving it a try."
9901,"Honestly, the game is kinda a downgrade from the old Crossfire, but in the end the game is fun and requires a lot of skill to master compared to Crossfire where the hit-box is like shooting a fucking elephant, on here the hit-box for the head is just right to the point where getting a head shot is luck or actual skill instead of just spraying, the graphics are pretty nice the variety of guns and ""Perks"" are nice, the game is kind of pay to win but, eh I personally don't care for that kind of stuff at least you get what you're paying for, the amount of maps is kind of a let down and the amount of players and toxicity that occurs every game is atrocious, the game still has charm tho, it's thrilling when you start to actually do something and kill people and get ""Rank Up"" in the game, it has a unique system where you level up every time you do the objective or kill somebody it also has points for every time you do those things as well, each weapon has it's own unique characteristics and there are plenty of events and things that keep this game some what alive, new playable characters and skins are added every now and then, as of the making of this review there are currently over a dozen new weapon skins for a ton of weapons, there are classes that you can choose from and the perks vary from the different classes, so one is better than the other but that could change based on the map you're on, the frame rates and lag are next to non existent if you have a decent computer that is, or have good ping, etc. I recommend this game if you're looking for a thrilling, fun, FPS that comes out with content every now and then, there is free DLC items as well.

In the end YES I recommend this game but don't go playing this game if you're looking for a bright, and decent community, my first game I was called a noob (LMAO) and like I said if you're looking for a decent free FPS, look no further this game might be for you. 7/10"

And that's basicly that. Guns are not cheap if you want them forever, but once in a while theres a big discount, not even mentioning that if you actually like the game itself, you will have steady stream of temporary guns and make money rather fast.
And I am impatient about that in fps games, so that's something.
Overall, 7/10. Just a decent, fun to play game."

Honestly its pretty good, graphics are better than cs:go, though i will say  you wont get any permanent skins or shit without paying. Also, lately its been dead, i waited a while to get into a match. the death sound is ear rape. Also it has that stupid temporary skin thingy, you open a crate and get a weapon skin for free for like a day then its gone, which i think is hella stupid. If you don't mind waiting a few minutes for a match and using guns without skins for a while then this is the game for you.

10026,"[h1] Black Squad [/h1]

A generic first-person shooter PvP game, Developed and released by NS Studio. Been playing this from the beginning on and off. 
A Dying game that used to be somewhat enjoyable. well, it still kinda is enjoyable. 
There isn't a lot to say good about this game. other than the fact it's free to play and give quite a few game mode's to choose from. The base gameplay is pretty decent nothing to write home about, same as what almost every other FPS shooters have to offer maybe a bit less. 

For an FPS shooter, gunplay must a top priority but it seems after all this time Black Squad still hasn't figured out all the kinks. 
I wouldn't be wrong if I said the shooting and recoil mechanics are horrible. The game seems to be pretty much inspired by Call of duty and Counter-Strike Global Offensive which is totally okay, I wish Black Squad took some good qualities out of these two. 

I have tried Black Squad on different tires of computer's from basic office Dell pre-builds to high-end gaming PC's, The game runs okay but was those experiences satisfying? No... 
The game literally feels the same as playing on a Dell Pre-build potato even on high-end systems with good GPUs. The game literally froze and crashed while writing this line. 
The sluggish nature of the UI adds to the bad experience. The game launcher is pointless and only adds to the latency of you clicking play and getting in-game with your friends. 
Weirdly CPU intensive. I should have to wait for the amount of time I have to wait each time I hit play. I running this game on my SSD for crying out loud. 

As I said there's not much to say positive about Black Squad but let me mention a few. 

[h1] Positive's [/h1]

[list]
    [*] Decent Free to play experience. 
    [*] Good assortment of cosmetics. 
    [*] Somewhat good gameplay experience. 
    [*] The main game modes are decent. but not enough to hold a large player base. 
    [*] Quite a few maps. 
    [*] Very Small yet loyal player base. 
    [*] Headshot feels extremely satisfying. ( which alone held me to the game for a while ). 
[/list]

[h1] Negative's [/h1]

[list]
    [*] Runs very poorly, even on high-end systems. 
    [*] Unpolished. 
    [*] Not much working being put into for improving the player experience/The game. 
    [*] Long wait times to get into matches.
    [*] Hackers are a major issue, like any other game. but unlike other games, Black Squad is handling this poorly. 
    [*] Headshot feels extremely satisfying. ( which alone held me to the game for a while ). 
    [*] High ping always. 
    [*] Only Cosmetics Items are being added to the game. which only helps if you have a health player base. 
    [*] Lag and Shuttering Issues are common. 
    [*] Most maps are made by toddlers. no creativity, no elements in the maps to make the game enjoyable or exciting. It all just     
         comes down to the one with a better aim and reaction time. 
    [*] Removed item trading.
    [*] DLC's are overpriced and not worth it even for a 50% price cut. 
    [*] The Sound and Audio menu is so bad I play with no audio for my own sanity. Audio in this game needs a lot of work.
    [*] Add a god damn slider for annoying menu mouse hover sounds effect. 
    [*] Poor Hit registry.
    [*] Most gun recoils are a mess. 
    [*] Tries hard to hold on to the player base with free limited time use skins and items. 
    [*] Store page full of one word/sentence false positive reviews. 
    [*] A lot of bugs, while writing this review I found a bug that disabled me from using my Grande launcher.
    [*] My windows which hasn't crashed in 11 months finally crashed after I click play on this game for the 3rd time. 
    [*] While playing for the 3rd time my mouse keeps stops working in-game. 
    [*] Weirdly CPU intensive. My CPU is well over the recommendation but still, my CPU is having a bad time with this game.  
[/list]


[h1] Summary [/h1]

I can go on and on. 
This is an enjoyable game no gonna lie but needs a lot of work and creative content. 
so far so bad. 
I don't think this game has a future or can make a major comeback. 
Can't really recommend someone this game, at this time. 
I would've kept playing this game after my review but the game crashed my windows, which hasn't crashed or given me any issue in 11 Months. Ok, am done time to say bye. 
Best wishes, happy Gaming...

10149,Thank you Valofe for fu*king  up another game :)
10150,Me likey
10151,crap
10152,If you are looking for a good Free to play shooter with good mechanics and rather fun gameplay if you don't rage quit  ^w^   then that's the game for you .
10153,Fun mix between cod and cs.
10154,fake version of cs with cheap knifes
10155,"very similar to another game but it's better

"
10156,Awesome Game!!!
10157,"Black squad is a pretty decent game, however I dislike the pay to win aspect the game has. The developers make it hard to get new and good guns, knives, and even grenades. For almost 20 hours of the game I played I didn't have grenades because you have to either buy a case and hope to get a temporary 3 day grenade or end up trying to get one of the daily login rewards. All in All, the game is decent but very hard for beginners."
10158,veri najs

This game is interesting if you have more free time this 
game is for you XOXO

10160,pretty boring

10162,A fun game but needs inprovments.
10163,"Nice game to play, but it is kinda hard to start as a completely new player."
10164,nice game
10165,This game was really good once. But the developers are llike azy cats. New skin update in every month and not good optimization. Without all this game is good
10166,"My favourite game in the steam, but now, this game is sucks!!!!"
10167,Do not touch this game with a 10 foot pole.
10168,cool game
10169,better than csgo

10177,"it's good game but it need to improve the gameplay and fix some bugs 
"
10178,It is not that bad
10179,"Game vibe is good, great sound effects and good weapon mechanics. The UI is a catastrophe to say the least. I just couldn't find myself with all that colorful mass on the screen. This needs to be addressed."
10180,ez game
10181,Great Game!!
10182,TRASH GAME
10183,Summer Sale Quest hehe
10184,Very highspeed
10185,"Well after A.V.A be like dead every where on earth :( the 1 good thing is this game , the next best FPS i can play. The lag is quite hard and some time it still got cheater but this game is nice hope it is not die any time soon 7/10"
10186,Amazing I've never seen a hacker and since everyone is decently trash at the game it's not hard for new players to learn at all!
10187,no drip on god best free first person shooter
10188,Is this still relevant?
10189,Nice game...
10190,Great shooter game
10191,i love these game
10192,"For free, yes get it if you are broke. Otherwise actually put your money into something worth it. This game is far from needing work, it needs a new overrhaul and to not cater to everything we hate in a COD game. I would rather play COD than this even if 12 year olds were crying and people were toxic. One match was enough because it took 3 minutes to match, AFTER the fact I spent 20 min on the ""wrong"" playlist. Everyone is doing the event. Besides the map being small and lack of reasonable skill to get around them, NO bullet pen along with random features. the tutorial is 3 min long and pointless, a screen will pop up every 10 seconds and freeze your movement for 5 seconds. I truly went in with an open mind and couldn't push myself to play more. This game is not about skill when it's always a lucky HS that is one bullet"
10193,nice
10194,Nice cs alternative
10195,pretty shit tbh...
10196,free RSS

10202,asu
10203,verybad
10204,"amazing free game, love to play it!"
10205,"cool game, cant run it though cause my battleye isnt working :c"
10206,it's a fun game 6/10
10207,it was the best game for me but badly they send it to hell the developers i mean they kept adding new updates which only adds new skins to purchase them with real money I hate this actually the servers are dead its infrequent to find a game
10208,Good free to play shooter with no P2W aspects. Recommending that to anyone looking for an alternative cs:go game.
10209,good
10210,Alright for a free to play.
10211,Nice game....gg
10212,rubish
10213,"This game is dying, totally not worth any of your time if you start playing just now."
10214,"[h1]Pro's[/h1]
   - Fast paced;
   - Headshot sounds (pure eargasm);
   - weapons can attach grenade launchers;
   - Game is fun;
   - Many Game modes: TDM, Demolition, Pve (<-only during events),...;
   - Ingame currency;
   - Lot's of content: weapons, skins,...

[h1]Con's[/h1]
    - Macro users (BattleEye is INCOMPETENT, it even fails in detecting AutoHotKey running in the background);
    - Lack of decent report system (Devs tell everyone to ""send a letter"", but nothing get's ever changed/problems are still there after x years;
    - Mayor issues are NOT handled, Devs only fix CRITICAL bugs that prevent the game from being played; 
    - Hackers (mostly from high ranks/clans but sometimes also from new players);
    - Unstable FPS (even if you have a high end specs);
    - Unstable Servers;
    - Ping ristriction ( above 200ping players should get kicked out of game but somehow it doesn't really happen/work);
    - Players with high ping (they have the advantage in every game, you will end up losing a match because of it + makes the game LAGG as hell);
    - Afk farmers (mostly visible during events);
    - 64bit problem still not resolved (some players still have to start up the game in 32bit to be able to play);
    - Game would randomly crash;
    - Weapons: (the majority are very similar to each other and can get quite boring to use);
    - Weapon ballance: (either you have ""Spray and pray"" types of guns or you have guns that do some recoil and damage);
    - Partner Program (you don't get alot for what you do, it's really not worth it according to many former partners);
    - Communication between devs and players (REALLY BAD, people have been and are still voicing their concerns and positive criticism about this game but devs show no care what so ever);
    - Ingame currency (after you get the weapons you want it's pretty useless afterwards. 
    - Skins (something the devs are spending the majority of their time with instead of improving the game or fixing the major issues this game still has. If they update the game they usually cram it in everyone's face that there are new skins. Most of the skins are pretty bland, somewhat re-used from older designs and even ripped off from other games like example the neon skins= Killing Floor. 
Also you CAN'T SELL nor TRADE SKINS anymore! If you have a very rare skins that's £/$/€25 or more worth, well then you are basicly f*cked.
Basicly DO NOT BUY SKINS WITH HIGH VALUE!!);
    - Maps (they might look good but they are really badly designed, easy camping spots, easily to throw a grenade which then would land all the other side of the map, bad angles/holding spots, sometimes way too big,...);
    - Devs are more focused on making money;
    - LOW player base (that's because of the devs pushing older/highrank players away due to these problems)
    - Game is slowly dying (from 15K to +-5K players and slowly dropping even more);
    - Constant no hit reg (this will happen a lot in the game, devs will denie that actually happens even with videos of proof that exist online);

[h1]Final verdict[/h1]
This game has a great concept and potential, you'll have fun at the beginning playing this game. 
But after a several hours of gameplay you'll start to notice these problems that i've mentioned too. 
Saddly the devs are more focussed on milking this game dry untill its really dead."

10258,"Pretty solid game for an early access. Game just came out for release, so there should be lots more to come."
10259,"This is one of the rare F2P which is NOT pay to win! The skins are just cosmetics :)
Fast and good squad based MP fun. It's a COD and CS:GO hybrid.

EDIT: This game has been dying since the Valofe takeover in November 2020. The new developper is making bad decisions with their updates, e.g. making competitive play solo. This decision alone made our active clan stunned and not playing the game anymore. 

They only seem interested in selling weapon or character skins for $$ and are simply not focused on the gameplay or to fix the cheater problem. Clan play or with a group of friends, has been discouraged. No more Steam market, no more incentive for players to play daily or weekly. There is no connection with their playerbase at all. I start to think that the new owners of this game don't understand English but only know how to milk a cow."
10260,i love this game
10261,enjoyable and fun fps however i believe all skins should be marketable and tradable
10262,"this game will burn your computer.it has such high quality graphics my eyes started bleeding 11/10,my favorite game"
10263,Counter Strike Clone. Pretty Fun and not driven by PTW mechanics.
10264,"It's bad, trust me
this game really feels like a steam release of a browser game
the scale of the models makes it harder to see
 the skins make the game annoying to look at
( I don't want to team up with anime girls and bald old guys in lab suits)
don't play."
10265,Awesome Game <3

10279,nice
10280,"Not too bad for a free-to-play. It's like a combination of Call of Duty multiplayer with some CS:GO elements. My only complaint is the main menu screen, which is a little hectic and cluttered. It runs on the Unreal Engine, which works well on low-setting for older hardware or integrated graphics."
10281,"It's not the worst game I can imagine spending your time on, but you can buy the call of duty Black Ops 3 multiplayer pack for $14.99 and spend far less money in the long run with a more solid and complete experience."

10321,"To start with the downsides,
- 3/4 of the player base owns an Anime skin
- the Gunplay equals a mobile fps
- Respawn points equal you being shot to death immediately
- Matchmaking equals playing with the chinese
- Weapons equal what's the point of handguns, assault rifles and/or anything else than the sniper rifles
- also there's really awkward forced acog sights on every weapon so you get x2 zoomed in to an enemy 1m away from you

Now to the upsides"
10322,NICE SHOTING GAME

10330,Best free game in steam market :)
10331,Fast peek B4 u get peeked 😬
10332,"After quite some hours of gameplay and reading reviews, I've come to the realisation that the majority of the bad reviews are just from players who can't stand losing to better players. Especially during the beginning of a new competitive season. As most players have to grind their way back up to Lion or Cobra, whilst playing against buffalos/wolfs.

I think this game still has great potential. It's fun, pretty well balanced and the competitive matches can be great!"
10333,"good game

10380,CS GO is better :D
10381,"Black squad is decent from a gameplay perspective, but it is undoubtedly one of the more generic titles to hit the stores, and honestly theres nothing special or memorable in my time with it. In the past, Black Squad's sole advantage over it's incessant comparisons to the very similiar CSGO was that it was free, and CS was not.

Well, not anymore, said Gabe Newell."
10382,"decent fps game, addictive"
10383,Fun Free game
10384,very nice and fun game to play
10385,"A good game, it has some things it needs to make it more addictive. But for the time i've played it i have enjoyed it a lot. I like this game because even for low spec systems you can run the game at 30fps. With low systems I mean Intel i3 5gen and integrated graphics. I recommend this game to people who like a challange. It takes a lot of time before you get actually really good in this game.
I rate it a 7/10"

10397,"An honest review..
With more than 440+ of hours to spend in this game, I have something to say.

1: Noreg has been in the game right from the start and still not resolved after 2 years
2: Many cheaters in the game if you go through discord of black squad and you talk about it they do nothing about them delete your messages and mute you
3: There are players with more than 30 kd even with screenshot prove they do nothing about it.
4: Developers are only busy making skins that you can no longer sell on the steam market but nothing is done about the cheating problem.

I really enjoyed playing this game but it can't go on like this I hope it will change soon"
10398,NIce game :D

10492,"I don't know what to say, quite speechless the UI is utterly pitiful the maps design is alright nothing special. overall this game is bad I very much dislike it and honestly wish steam would Higher its standards on listed games I honestly think Epic games launcher wouldent support this garbage mistake of a game"
10493,Really fun to play ! People compare it to csgo but it s way faster !
10494,"Good game, sad that the game servers are dead now... [Press F to pay respect]"
10495,ok
10496,goood game sdudee
10497,is gud
10498,Total piece of shit that makes Warface look good.
10499,It's like Squad but
10500,Its ok!
10501,"Good Game with good gun mechanic. maybe CSGO has harder aim mechanic but Black Squad has a lot of fun in some way too.
There's 2 types of Assault Rifle you can try depend on your playstyle. there's Light Assault Rifle like M4, ACR, or MDR that has low recoil so you can spray and kill enemies. or Heavy Assault Rifle which has high damage that can kill enemies in few shots. 
all sniper rifle can 1 hit even if you buy it with In-game currency. and yes. All the gun's balanced. the only thing you need is polishing your aim. 
One more thing : Black Squad > Point Blank"
10502,Why did you guys reset everyones inventory? I spent like 30 dollars of my spare money on this game for items even from the community market and they're just gone and I get nothing? And you reset everyones fucking leveling progress and tutorial completion? Fucking really?

10516,Not too bad
10517,Fun game but alll this shit happening where you cant trade or sell a skin that is still aquirable in game threw cases or dlc is bullshit like wasted alot of money cause i thought you could atleast trade or sell em turns our i was wrong would love it if they can make everything tradeable and marketable !
10518,Why when i press play to enter in game he doesn t open?
10519,"I've been playing for a year now with over 200+ hours invested in the game, and I've enjoyed all of it, It is a very fun game and I recommend it to anyone as one of, if not, the best fps games. Every weapon in the game is well balanced and anyone can easily win  using any of the weapons in the game. Each game mode is unique and fun, especially playing against your friends in a melee only match. 10/10 would recommend."
10520,"Don't waste your time, it's garbage..."
10521,"poop game.

Good gameplay but with almost 5k players on im still waiting 3-5 mins in quickplay matchmaking just to be put into a TDM...with everybody at over 100 ping including myself and penalized if i leave. With the game being as old as it is, no reason the matchmaking should take this long for unplayable games. Juts go play ironsight, the official launcher not steam."
10522,Like it
10523,A wonderful free game. Nice graphics .
10524,"long-time matchmaking, just a few player still play it."
10525,so good
10526,"THE PING BAN UPDATE SUCKS , MAKE IT LIKE CS CONTROL MAX PING TO ACCEPT MATCH not auto ban from it and PS the ping to servers in the menu is reallly different(higher) from ping to servers in the game so it's even worse can't play anymore it sucks bye bye bleh devs u broke what was already good.
EDIT: they did fix it and allowed higher pings but already left the game so , still dont waste ur time on this game ppl it is fun BUT SO NOT 2k20 game"
10527,"Big update, worth dlc with new weap and skin, gacha still suck as usual....
Need better anti-cheat...."
10528,"No respawn time, seems like a mindless shoot and die. I played 16v16 btw, I didn't have the chance to play other game modes."
10529,"Hackers, gets old in 5 mins.  Micro transactions, who would spend money on this lol???????????  anyway try if u want, waste of time.  TRASH"
10530,dont waste your time
10531,"I mean it's okay but no the best, but if you want to play something when you're bored it's good I would say a 7.5 out of 10"

 what does that mean? can someone give you a response to this message? Thanks. I would be very grateful for it!"
10539,"jesus christ, this game still dont fixed the bug where it cant log into steam AFTER MULTIPLE YEARS WTF
the way that you can only run with a knife is just trash. and the weapons itself feel like paintball guns, and something is very odd about the camera movement, it feels very unprecise and slow
acceleration definitly is present which is a absolute nogo in a competitive fps game!
i would give this game another try today, but if it wont let me play (ffs)
than just eat this review"
10540,"Your new update is bad. Firstly not started in normal mode, only safe mod. Now louncher just not started."
10541,The UI is terrible and the game doesn't feel like a normal fps. I don't know why it has such a high rating when this game just didn't come close to other fps games.
10542,BEST
10543,Spent 40$ and still no luck at the gacha.. RIP money
10544,it would be great if i could log into the game!
10545,This games pretty alright its a very simple shooter but its pretty fun for a free game.
10546,"Briefly about the game:
- constant lags and bugs,
- cheaters that no one is fighting,
- terrible imbalance in the formation of teams,
- miserable crooked cards.

P.S. Separately, I congratulate the idi0ts from VALOFE - with your stupidity and greed, you kill the game faster than cheaters, non-working servers and crooked patches. :("
10547,the guns are not balanced lmao

10572,a realy good game but the devs dont give a shit
10573,Nice Time killing Game
10574,it was a great game with multiple classes instead of just shoot at their head and it had a 5v5 or 8v8 bomb mode that was for me the compettiitve for when i wanted to do that but the fun of it was using the classes and having a strategy with the boxes that were to be destroyed
10575,Total shit
10576,"no toxic equals no fun xD
Careful meeting me in the game you may get salty lol"

10584,funnnn but it takes too long time to start a match.
10585,BELUM COBA BETUL
10586,...
10587,"A good game but without cheaters
i hate cheater bcuz they are so noob without hack or something like that"
10588,"out of the many fps shooters i played i like this one the most with hit boxes close to 100 % accuracy, very optimised game can run at 120 fps low setting with 8 gb ram and a gtx 1050. My only problem is that the best ping i get is 120 ms because i live in australia if you can relocate on of the sea servers closer to Australia it would be amazing. other then that great amount of variety of guns but should and some new guns into the game. last of all is when you buy in game currency and get something out of a box you should be able to sell it on the community market.

to rate this game i will give it 4.5 out 5  overall in all aspects.

Gold box is a scam i open it 34 times never got anything other than nades and sprays maybe you got luckier"
10589,too many cheaters
10590,"amph i cant play black squad because of the battle eye
computer always connection lost zz"

10593,"Game had broken recoil, hackers, and broken damage. Developers go deepthroat a monkey."
10594,awsom
10595,"The game is ok but.... the hackers, pls fix"
10596,"It was fun but I'd suspect to say that the days of first person shooters is practically over, most people have gone over to the AAA shooters where the toxic youth and grumpy old timer community normally congregates. Black Squad wasn't even an innovative nor inventive shooter and that's ultimately the ones I liked, this one was yet another 'clone' shooter with apparently another useless anti-cheat device. I think most people want to see a 'good shooter' again and none of this copy-paste circus act mess with publishers who care more about cashcows than a good game.

Sadly, free shooters only do copy-paste over innovative and creative. It was the case with Ghost in the Shell before I think two or so years later it was forced to shut down due to a lack of funding and really bad reviews. I'm thinking a third of the community wish that same fate for this game, the other third see a game who's community died faster than a senseless fad.

Me, I came to it because it was free and seemed to be about the only shooter out there that supposedly was grabbing a following, however like all those in the past it comes and goes leaving you on the nomadic journey to find another one.

Point blank...This game is dead, next to nobody plays it anymore. End of story."
10597,gg
10598,"Yo uh... have better servers yet? And what about NA west?

10599,"It is a pretty nice shooter. I find it fun, personally, but I still prefer Counter-Strike."

10606,Gave this game a fair shot and its not fun to play. The gun play isnt good and the guns just kick to the right and left. It was painful to play this game.
10607,"Great fps game for being free.

We had talks of ESL LANs, creation & overhaul of tournament observing tools, and fostering gaming environment for the next level of competitive play that would have put this game side-by-side to the big league games like CS:GO and Valorant.

[b]The game that I see now is a mere ghost of what it used to be.[/b] Really, it is a shame."

10619,eh its okay sometimes can get annoying with all the camping though
10620,"This game is fucking dead, but don't worry they keep adding shitty skins that you will never get unless you waste 500€. There are also hackers, but hey look at this new skin. Devs don't care.

I played this thing about 800h. I mean, I know what I'm talking about. It's addictive, just that."

10625,"buggy game , developers killed it now it's freezing without any reason even tho my pc runs it at ultra without any problems . looks like developers are busy making skins that u can't even sell em on steam .... this game is just LOL , i can't recommend this instead of CS:GO just because this garbage is full of cheaters even more than CS:GO , fix this gay game!"
10626,"LOVING IT

10627,"Optimize your game, it’s just unbearable when you have a stable 200 fps and then drops to 20 during a fight, you couldn’t think about your players at least sometime."
10628,"Honestly, you should try this"
10629,"If u dont have cheats for it then dont play it since everyone (almost everyone cheats) if u play it fair , well you will be butt fucked by 13 year old cheaters lol community sucks and it's almost non existent .."

10631,It's been over a year since i've played this game and literally nothing has changed:D Wouldn't recommend to anyone. This game sucks harder than the most powerful vacuum on the face of the earth.

10637,"dear makers of black squad, let me first start by saying what a fucking garbage ass dog shit game this is.  First, you get a spawn protection for a solid 10 seconds, LET ME ALSO SAY, you dont have to worry about it going away if you move, oh no, no worries my friend, you can run and shoot all you like while being a god mode :D.  great mechanic added to the game, honestly top tier gameplay right there.  THEN let me get to the good part, YOU HAVE TO BUY GRENADES PER DAY TO FUCKING USE WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, not at all a pay to win game bois, no no, this game makes heroes and generals look like a fair game to play no money needed to be spent, last but not least the fucking award system, why the fuck wouldnt you just make it go straight to my account instead i have to fucking go to the god damn inbox just to collect my 50 medal award.  Who ever made these maps, let me give a big shoutout to that autistic motherfucker, with zero fucking brain cells, like the unborn kids in my ballsack can create better maps then this, garbage game, not worth even if its free."
10638,FKNG GAME. A LOT OF CHEATERS!!!!! FKNG DEVELOPERS!!!!
10639,"This game is definitely not worth buying , I have had well over 20 instances where it won't load the map or game  and it gives me an error code about anti cheating. Hell I am the farthest person to be acused of cheating , I finish in last place in almost every game I play"
10640,Great game ^^

10643,great game until it stopped working
10644,"it is a great game i like it the graphics r awesome and the gameplay is endless
"
10645,"I love this game, for a free 2 play game its is amazing and it has a goodish community.

I reccomend this game as long as you don't mind being sniped in the chest at point blank from time to time but when you try to do it yourself the bullet just goes to haven."

10650,game kok sepi
10651,Game used to be good until it just puts me in EU servers now with 200 ping instead of NA servers. Game went from Pretty Good to TRASHHH GARBAGEEEEE :D
10652,Fun game and pretty solid. Just wish it didnt take a while to find a match.
10653,"Complete and utter trash, if you're looking for a good f2p shooter go play Ironsight or CSGO this game isn't worth your time.
also sound effects are awful."
10654,I tried to get into this game it is just plain boring and I love First person shooters.
10655,help me he's here
10656,"What I like about this is the requirements, I ran this on a very sh**** pc, it ran very smoothly and with high settings."
10657,"This game is a perfect example of potential that is wasted. It was great when it first came out, that was until the devs became money hungry and ruined it. Now all you get is 20+ skins, no new content, tons of bugs which are still not fixed, the list goes on.
Not recommended."
10658,"Black Squad is an Unreal Engine 3 powered tactical shooter developed and published by Neowiz Games. It aims to compete with other lobby based Korean tactical shooters like CrossFire and Alliance of Valiant Arms. Like other tactical shooters players earn money by playing games and use it to purchase new weapons to use on the battlefield. Play each round as either the Vipers (Terrorists) or the Peacekeapers (UN Backed Counter-Terrorists) across multiple maps and game modes.

Black Squad Key Features:

Varied Game Modes – Enjoy 10+ unique game modes from traditional team deathmatch / demolition to more exotic VIP defense.
Stat Tracking – Track your individual performance (KDR/Dmg/Headshots/etc) with each individual weapon.
Quickplay Matchmaking – Skip the pesky server lobby and find a match quickly.
Familiar Gameplay / Interface - Inspired by traditional Korean based lobby shooters like AvA and Combat Arms."

10663,clsoe to csgo but kinda dead.
10664,manual ban waiting room....
10665,Actually before this game was too good but after updates they destroyed the game . Now there are so many hacker .Less players .Badly optimised game . I had done almost 2k + hour with by different I'd . But now this game is so bad . Servers are also not good . They turned off community market . Now almost every items u can't sell on market 😡
10666,full of hacker and cheater??!!
10667,"Jeez, where do i start... The graphics, blood, particles, are outdated, i thought it was an old game like borderlands so ill excuse the textures, when i go to write the review... 2017!!??? how!?? Not to mention the bugs, Fallout 76 and pubg on xbox combined had less glitches than this. When I got onto a quick match with a waiting que of 10 minutes, the screen went white, I heard the sounds but i couldnt see crap, After minutes of trying to fix it I had to restart my computer because it wouldnt let me, win button out of it. NS STUDIO, you had good intentions, but horrible delivery, If you can respond to get the issues fixed, thats great! But the game itself is lacking ALOT."
10668,good game !
10669,Awesome Game and very good game for playing with friends
10670,good game
10671,Very good free to play game !
10672,"i cant play, i tried to change region and i found nothing
the practice is just mindless bots that dont attack or move that just stand there and die...
you cant invite people"
10673,FPS Fun
10674,"118 hr of fun for me as a casual player. with the latest update one cannot leave a competetive match anymore, not even by ""surrendering"" or restarting. 
WHY"
10675,"Simply filled by cheaters, there is no effort by the productor to remove them by the game. And btw the game is without a serious anticheat system, Battleeye simply doesn't work well.
Pieno di cheaters e nel gioco non c'è un sistema anticheat decente."
10676,nc game
10677,good
10678,"This game is my joy to relax on my free time. I like the graphic in it, and many other things like how the weapons are not too hard to get. It's not really pay to win, so it's quite fair and everyone can really enjoy it. However I'm getting a MacBook Pro because of career reason and I think it's not supported on mac os. Can BlackSquad team make that happen that I can play it on my macbook pro?

Keep it up! I really like this game.

10679,chill game. bad devs.
10680,just download
10681,Killed the game by making items not tradable and marketable
10682,"if you play on SEA, you'll learn a lot of philiphines curse word from comp like bobo, bogak, and tang ina

also playing the game is NOT rewarding at all anymore. i suggest to play this game if you only wanna play with braindead mode and dont play it competitively"

10684,"I was playing the tutorial on this game. Then out of no where I get Banned. I was not using hacks, and they said I was spoofing. Even tho I did not even hack and get banned."
10685,New CS
10686,Best free 2 play game on steam so far <3
10687,Honestly a waste of 5 gigs. Played the game when it first came out and was fun. Played it again recently and had the satisfaction of uninstalling it again.
10688,"i really suggest a change of recoil pattern in every signle gun, it became pretty random since the firsts updates of this game, short distance fight are like a lotto in this game due the uncontrollable bullet spray,  after firsts 3-4 bullets gone, guns pattern become totally unpredictable and no way to control it, just have a look on practice mode and spray with guns like ak12 or type, after the firsts 3-4 bullets the clip goes really nowhere completely out of crosshair or whatever u planned to shoot in, i dont even talk about gun like kriss or mdr and every high fire ratio gun because they are simply a shame and they have no sense to exist in this game.
So, as a matter of this fact, game force u to spray 3-4 bullets at time you can spray the next load of bullet after waiting the recoil kicked back in original position.
Mine still a positive review because afterall i am playing this game and i enjoy it, but it can improve so much with no effort, developers took the decision to use this kind of recoil pattern to not allow cheaters to program macro that could automatically control recoil, but in this way game is just not competitive for high standard like CS GO could be for example, cheaters will exist forever no way you can stop it, they also changed bullet reload for snipers reducing the rateo of fire on some guns, but sniper remain OP cause it gets 1 shoot 1 kill most of the time u hit someone, no way somebody can save his ass after sniper bullett unless it hit arms or legs.

I am really disappointed on developers choice but still admit game gives a lot of fun and satisfactions, for this reason cant vote this game with a thumbs down"
10689,THIS GAME SO Good BUT AK SO BAD IS  S H I T ! dont buy ak ! never cant control

10701,3rd match in run into a hacker. Doesn't even have a report button. gg never touching it again
10702,Baler optimization -_- Retarded game
10703,Matchmaking too long. Wasting my time. Unplayable.
10704,o
10705,"As an elder fan & player of the Counter-Strike franchise, 
Im sad to say that: But its now time to move on.
And I Got to say, this game have what it takes to become a fair competitor of CSGO. 

Pros:
-A concept of FPS focused toward competitive play's.
-A gameplay that feels as good as any Counter-Strike games.
-A extremely large selection of well balanced weapons.
-All weapons have iron sights.
-Good selection of game modes (Bomb Defusal/5v5/TDM/Competitive).
-Offers faily challenges for XP & Rewards
-Dosen't feature BattleRoyale
-Its Free to play.

Mid:
-Has Loot Boxes (Gladly, its only skins and you can get all their normal versions for in-game currency).

Cons:
-International Matchmaking Server (Prepare to fight the World Pros)


Overall Note: 8.5/10
Exept the worldwide matchmaking issue, this game pretty much covers all the needed aspects to be a good game, no pay to win influence here, only your skilled gunplay & gameplay matters."
10706,"Hackers and Shit choices by the devs to not limit ping and bundle all countries together.
this game remains a ""oh i've got 10 minutes to waste lets play black squad""  but its not holding in game like it used to, i wont be sinking money into this and its because the servers seam to be getting worst, EU only a few months ago there was lots of choice but it seams by lumping all the games into one list which seams to hide the fact there is less games running at the same time and any that are seam to have a high population of high ping players that manage to kill you from nowhere.

UPDATE 03/2020
Game is getting toxic and pings are getting shitter, you shoot someone your ""a cheater"" you get shot your going to get trash talked. my own personal ping has gone form 20 as standard to 50-60 all the time same PC same connection. This game is uninstalled for the last time, would rather play Anthem"
10707,it's fun.
10708,"This game is fun, However i had a huge problem with the game-mode shotgun, (in which you only use shotguns) It appeared that anyone who didn't have a shotgun In their inventory, Was left with a knife, And everyone who DID had a shotgun, I was left trying to run around Picking up weapons and immediately getting one shot by someone around the corner. I don't know if i was doing something wrong, but every time i spawned i only had a knife, i even saw people spawning with shotguns."
10709,"it is a good game but pretty unfair for new players

10710,BRUH SOUND EFFECT
10711,it's a good game ..

These are that probs :

1. Weak GameGuard Battleye 
2. Need more new event or content   ( For example : new mode battle royale , peek option, healing item or whatsoever )
3. Add report / kick / kill cam in game... ( they said we will abuse it ? then what happen to some cheater which we cant record / kill cam ? ( We just wait until match end or leave the game ? how you make us easy to report a cheater ? )

Beside that already good game.. only need little push to make great again..."

10760,yes
10761,"installed tried to change servers, because brazil servers=lag rubber banding all over, and  they dont speak spanish so great.
can't change server = uninstall"
10762,"OK so, lets start off with the good points,
1. the guns are very fun to use and fire
2. the animations for guns and other stuff are all great
3. this game runs like a champ on just about anything
4. there are lots of variety in playstyle and weaponry to choose from

now let's go into why i don't like this game
1. balance. there are so many guns in the game that are just terrible. what i mean by that is the ttk for different guns. on certain guns, the ttk is really high (most smgs now) and on some they are riduculously low (most ARs in the game)
2. players. the playerbase is extremely toxic not to mention the lack of players overall. it can take several minutes to find the most played gamemode of the game.
3. running issues. Now i know i said that it runs like a champ, but it does have severe problems like crashing. in the span of 30 minutes i crashed like 4 times
5. the game is pay to win. a person could get all the gear they wanted if they just have money. not to mention that grenades are bought or gotten from loot boxes.
6. maps. now some maps are fairly balanced, but not all of them. certain maps are very one-sided.
this just barely scratches the surface of this game, if you want add on in the comments"
10763,"Really poor map design. Weapon models and whatnot seem nice, but still feel so.. I don't know, childish. The voiceovers are cringey at best and the whole anime characters thing.. Grow up lmao. Oh and whoever the hell created UX for settings should be fired on stop. Mouse sensitivity presets? Come on, you're just grasping for completely useless functionality.."
10764,.Amazing game. A Linux build would be awesome :D
10765,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE this game. It's one million times better than PUBG, RUST or any survival game out there. For one it's simple and fair. Two it doesn't waste your time (A ten minute match full of thrill and excitement) I have 260 hours of play time so far. And three it's not depressing when you lose like the other survival games. Besides all the cheaters who play other games lose miserably in this game because they cannot cheat. To all my Black Squads comrades ""Eliminate all enemy forces!"" Haha"
10766,good
10767,"This game is awesome, defintely recommend."
10768,Worst Game In the History of FPS Game. Copy of CSGO and No Fairness in Matchmaking and also no Fairness in Partnership.

10788,"I would like to say this game is a mediocre of modern FPS since there's a system called P2W and for us low tier player who plays for free always getting owned by those rich player (a real issue here, pls fix the gun damage on every gun)

but yeah, it's pretty fun to play with friends.clan wars seems legit too. but I would like to get an in-game voice chat and it would be helpful for others too"
10789,"this Game Very Nice
"
10790,"please... update  
matching with same ability users system and  add some notifying user system ..please..  
 
"
10791,"This game is ok but I won't recommend it. 

1. The gun balance is not there.

OK. This is a fast paced shooter (kinda like cod) but with all the snipers except 1. 1 hit body shot the recoil is so weird you can't even call it recoil. Basically on the CZ rifle it goes up right then the recoil doesn't work then it literally flicks left and right not smoothly so that's for the recoil    

2. The maps are fuckin bad

The maps are so fucking unfun a couple of them are fun. In my opinion the long range maps are the worst. There is this map that has a desert look. and there is literally no cover so rifles and smgs cant do shit, hamlet is my favourite map tbh because it balances between snipers and rifles. 

3. The game is not fun.

I'm good at the game, I can top frag, but the game is just NOT FUN. it's like spawn, shoot enemy, die. I really think this game needs better gameplay

4. The game modes are very limited.

The game has comp, demolition, and TDM that's it. I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't.


                                                                          Thanks for reading my review"
10792,A very good real military theme FPS. It similar to CSGO but with tons of game modes. 10/10 would play again lol.
10793,much fun
10794,"good game but im not playing it anymore.
its great to spend your time with when u dont have any other shooter games :D"
10795,matchmaking system sucks no balance at all
10796,This is really a good game.Nobody Deserves a free game to be such like this.But the onlt problem is Shot no reg and also some issues with Ping and server.Hope they will fix it soon.

10800,Its a pretty fun game :)
10801,This game is trash. every time you click something the game sends you to your desktop.
10802,"In 2017 when i found this game first time, it looked very potential game which could be a popular  F2P FPS game in PC, but no. Now it's year 2019 and game has still Early Access title since release and the game is almost same random hitbox lottery, suttering, unbalanced teams. Yes, there's a Team Auto Balance in game, but it's not even working! Playing quick matches will give you a unbalanced teams or match is ending soon. Also, there are still high ping (150-250) players in same lobby even they combined all servers into one. Game still gets updates and they aren't even so useful if you're wishing they finally fix some annoying bugs instead of it they just release new skins, loot boxes and so on to make MONEY! I bet this game is dead before Early Access is over, there isn't even so much active players anymore like a year ago There was 7 to 9 thousand.  Now there is about 3 thousand and isn't very much in this game with many game modes.  This is a  bad example how to make F2P games. 

Time and money not so well spent..."
10803,I have never played this game.
10804,This game is really trash. Lots of hack and annoying teenagers. Getting worse with every uptade..
10805,i started playing the game it crashed 5 times and put me in a white screen 3 times the only way i could close it was to combine alt f4 esc and windows then i had to restart my pc 2 times and all that garbage in 23 minutes

10825,"Used to like it, but its pretty shit now. It seems more pay to win now than ever, which it claims not to be. Most servers are dead, can only find custom match, and almost all of them are bots. Ones that are demolition and just filled with high level trash talkers. Most of the updates are usless, no bug fixes, no new weapons, only new skins and different variations of a ingame weapon. What the fuck, i hate this game now. It devolved into a free to play, pay to win, shit game"

10827,"** Honest Review from an OG Player, 1100 Hours, 1.8 KDR, Been playing since Beta, am also a BS Founder. **

This WAS a great game...WAS! 

It WAS probably the best F2P FPS out! 

Decent graphics, mechanics and for the most part a well rounded game...so much so, that the community mostly looked over the hacker infestation, lack of any type of moderation, trash competitive scene, absolute joke of a reporting system, and a useless in room kick function...

But whats the kicker? What makes a 1100 hours played, Founding member of the game, say F*** it... this game has been destroyed and will die out within a year and a half?

Here it is....

Combining all servers into one? ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? Mixing up every region on the globe into one big ball of crap...

So, a  player has no option at all to keeping out a 300, 400, 500, 800, and yes...sometimes even a 1k+ pinger from their rooms...who was the moron who thought that idea up, and whats more...who's the moron that had that idea brought to them, backed it up and approved it to be implemented...


RIP Black Squad..."

10831,do you want to fight max lvl players each game while you dont know anything? do you want to fight people that dont take damage? do you want to see people dash around corners at the speed of light to where no one can shoot them while when you do it you get shot by EVERYONE?  well guess what this game is. it the tutorial is almost non existent. people seem to take a whole 30 rounds and not die. you have no clue what your doing when you get into a game. -90/10 this game is almost the worst game i have in my library

10843,First its copy of CS:GO secondly no fairness in game. 2018 Updates was good. In 2019 now Its trash . Please Don't Play this game.
10844,"Epic gameplays, however matchmaking kinda sucks golden balls. Over all I'd rate it 4/5."
10845,good game with a lot of bug
10846,Much like counterstrike but still fun to play especially free!
10847,Idk just good game of my mind
10848,I love this game
10849,Not up to the mark
10850,"After the update, when playing games, ping was very high and I met a lot of people using game-cheating software, it was really annoying and frustrating when I entered the game to entertain but regained my memories. like now. I had to leave the Crossfire before to play Blacksquad because of its fairness and charisma, I used to love this game, but after the latest update, I felt the game is now like a piece of trash. A lot of friends asked me to quit this game. 

I hope the publisher has a way to fix bugs and handle the current situation at the earliest."
10851,its an ok game i guess looks a lot like a cs:go copy and i did use this before i bought cs:go  but i don't know if the game really should be up cuz of that but if you want to train this would be a good way
10852,best free to play game with trash developers ;-)
10853,Nice Game.
10854,"1. Needs too much time to enter a game.
2. The developers does nothing to ban hackers.
3. You must play too many hours to increase your rank to play competitive mode (solo/duo).
4. If you want high damage weapons or any kind of skin you need to pay. At least the developers could have both ways to get a skin. For example 100.000 game cash or 0,99€ instead of 29,99€."
10855,"It is the beat hard FPS game ever 
love u Black Squad <3"
10856,this game is really great but now there are so many cheaters airmbot or wallhacks how devs will stop them players are getting less because of this cheaters
10857,hacking garbage
10858,"The game is good in free, graphic are good, FPS are good, But So many hacker in game"
10859,"I should of gave up on this game long time ago yet I tried my best to enjoy it but sadly I just can't take it anymore the game is garbage now,  Developers wont do anything or listen to what players say, They increase the types of rewards you can get but its not even worth sinking hours into anymore, They even increase the range of hours you have to play just to get a certain amount of currency which is so small yet you wasted hours on hours on for 1% of it, Yet they price items that are 100%X times the amount you need in order to purchase said item, They do all this just to say (Ohh Hey Now you can buy Perma skins!!!) yet your going to spend Hours on Hours on HOURS!! to get it. They do all of this yet they refuse to fix any major problems or add content that's worth playing.  Some maps are unbalanced still after all this time, Afk bots are still in the game just sitting farming event rewards making the match even more unbalance, There are tons of clans/players who uses scripts(hacks) yet they never get punished for what they do. They claim on twitter they take it very seriously, Yet they are still there I'm not the only one complaining about this there are tons on tons of other players who know who they are yet nothing happens, There are even video proof's ,Live Streams of them getting caught by players,  YET THE CLAN's are STILL THERE, Its a group of people who just Googled Blacksquad hacks downloaded the stupid thing and played every day carefree and to this day they are still in the game. Get away from this god forsaken game and find a better developer that actually cares to listen and do something about it."
10860,So awesome fps game
10861,"often crash
matchmaking like my sh** coming out of my butthole
sh**ty custom match, why do you combine all server into 1 ?
"
10862,"If your playing in NA just give up on this game already, NA server is more or less dead and getting into a quickmatch just to do events makes you wait in the lobby for 5-13+mins average just to get into a room with the new system. Rewards/{Perma Skins} for playing hours and hours and HOURS! gets you 98% of the time nothing that's just my luck though. The game went beyond downhill from when it started sadly and after all the junk they tried to lure you in with, They did nothing to fix the problems with bots in matches which just AFK just to farm event rewards to people promoting scripts (hacks) I just gave up on Developers which wont even do anything nor listen to the simplest request of the players, Just wanted to write this review since I played my last and final match with a person who constantly Headshotted people with 100% accuracy, Even when jumping like crazy to sneaking behind only to be found instantly (soundless) and getting a big-O-bullet to my head.  Who knows maybe he/she is that god dam good ? I consider myself a noob so how would I know ? Right ? Anyways RIP 5/13/19, Going to play CSgo and let my nephew with 1k+hours destroy me."

10879,"played!
liked!
software update!

10897,"(Comments allowed) Surprisingly good game
and very satisfying unpredictable recoil which does results in a higher trigger disclipline (you can not learn a specific spray pattern as you do in CS GO).
i love it that way. haters gonna hate.

There are 3 currency´s in the game (WHY WTF?)

Money - earned through gameplay/login rewards
Medals - achivment rewards (as far as i know)
BS Coins - Daily missions / Login reward (Thx@trick)
-
Ammo - (Real life money)


Tier1 weapons can be bought with money 
Tier2 weapons can be earned with medals (you can NOT buy these with RL money you earn medals through leveling progress of you account)

i will edit this review as soon as i gathered further information about it
keep in mind that this is my current point of view."
10898,its good game
10899,"DEAD GAME,LOTS OF CHEATER,NO GOOD CONTENT, JUST MAKE THE GAME LIKE IT USED TO BE 7 YEARS BACK (UPDATE) STILL TRASH :V"
10900,"Most the skins you can buy in game cannot be resold so there is no resale value to an account if you stop playing. Headshots occasionaly dont register,the game often glitches and hackers are rare but do exist.the competitive modes ranking system for solo/duos is completely broken, i personally dropped 200 points from when i was placed and the matches became harder.then i was upranked to a game with an average score 400 points greater than mine and i was one of the best players.

On the positive note it has alot of mode ranging from competitve 5v5 to tdm and 2v2.the game even offers daily modes with various weapon limitations.alot of different weapons to chose from anf a healthy amount of skins which can be earned without putting money into the game and alot of nice skins are rather cheap.

In conclusion its an unfinished game that could do with alot of work, i dont recommend for players looking to get into a competitve game however i recommend for people wanting to play casually."
10901,"nice game, my favourite things about it is all the free knifes you can get from it and the deals. I bought a £0.99 package (one time offer) instead of £9.99 (i done this ages ago and from what i can see, you can still get it)."
10902,"Unfortunately, we can't play this game in Indonesia"
10903,"Good game, it have less or no hacker, NOT LIKE BROKEN CS:GO SO MANY HACKER DAMN. Don't let this game have a hacker or cheater"
10904,This game is great for beginners who have never played multiplayer online before. However there is a problem with the way the software was engineered.
10905,Good game
10906,"I have been on this game since the very start just about. I do not have a lot of hours in game because they had a rough start. They have improved a lot since the release of Black Squad, but also have a long way to go. I think if they seize the moment and take over CSGO's spot they could do very well. The game is solid now overall as far as optimization goes, but needs work with the in-game aspect some as far as hit register and team balancing. They main reason team balance is non-existent is because the player base is too small right now. I hope people give this game a try and spread the word. This game in my honest opinion could beat out CSGO if they devs listen to the community and constantly stay on top of cheating and making sure their game is smooth. Overall a good and fun game with a unique twist. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone!"
10907,Not worth your time and Data.
10908,"Quick opinion -

Great alternative to CS:GO and Siege. The engine and gun mechanics are definitely some of the best I've seen in a F2P FPS game.
My one beef with this game is that the majority of players are people that haven't touched an FPS before and/or people that couldn't afford CSGO before that game went free, meaning high rank people are god-awful.
This is obviously not directly related to the game itself but I do feel it's relevant when it comes to recommending this game or not.
You'll have players with hundreds of hours clocked accuse you of cheating for just hitting basic shots that a silver 3 could pull off in CS:GO.

EXPECT ALL LOW-LEVEL PLAYERS TO EITHER BE ESL SMURFS OR SOMEONE THAT HAS NEVER TOUCHED A COMPUTER BEFORE.

I only have ~60 hours clocked but coming out of CSGO with around 2,000 hours I'm already better than 98% of the non Pro League playerbase it seems. This is not an attempt at bragging, just pointing out how bad the average BS player is.

Would definitely recommend this game if you can get 4 mates to play as well, (You're in for a really bad and frustrating time if you solo-queue)."
10909,Just felt like every other free to play shooter - nothing special here IMO
10910,One of the best F2P game I've ever played :D
10911,"Laggy, buggy, piece of garbage. Feels like a ported mobile game."
10912,"Although this game is rather fun i do have some issues with it
My first problem is that every time i want to play this game it takes ages to find a match... i think the longest iv'e waited is like 20 min before i just gave up... Another problem about this game i have is that you cannot change the resolution from 1360 x 768... Even though it has the option in the options menu like you can... you cant... its the only option... Enough about the bad though what about the good... all iv'e got to say about the good is that its a solid game, feels kinda like CSGO but not as good looking cause of the bad resolution but other then visuals gameplay wise its great... Overall i recommend"
10913,"I really enjoyed it, its free so give it a try"
10914,"I love this game with almost ever fiber in my body and it will always be one of my favorite Free to Play games.  But there is one small problem that i have, and that is matchmaking.  I will try to join a game and it always takes about 2-5 minutes to find a game.  I'm not sure if it really is matchmaking or not a lot of people play this game anymore. 4.6/5 stars."
10915,bye bye
10916,"as a f2p game i would say 

9/10 graphics
7.5/10 gameplay
no toxicness.
there should be mics so people at 5v5 mode can speak together not type.
All guns are good 
U might as well enjoy this game as it is a low spec game so u might aswell dont have problems playing it."

10920,good game.. but the recent update is awesome. ui is perfect but lack of finding matches. lots of hackers in the game.
10921,i feel like this game is sort of a less p2w version of warface and i  really do enjoy the game and i would indeed recommend this to others
10922,kinda cool
10923,Amazing Game Might Actually Be Better Than CS:GO
10924,"fk this game so fking bad ,in this fking game there are a lot of problme like crach and high ping and the compatitive is so bad . i am telling u the fking what happend to me fk this. game sh*t"
10925,"best fps free game ever its so much good and makes a really good contect every update
"
10926,Game gud
10927,"This game was good, really good! But the last update just killed it. This is what happen when you try to fix something that is working properly.

If you are wondering what the update broke, here is a quick list:

-The ping is too high and unplayable in the competitive mode. (150 to 300 ping for me).

-If the matchmaking system doesn't find a game with a ""good"" ping for you, it will just throw you in a game where you get 200 ping or higher.

-Even on EU server where I usually get 50 to 64 ping I get 80 to 110 ping now.

I don't recommend this game at all (what a shame it was a good FPS),almost all the players left the game and it's almost a dead game now.

R.I.P BlackSquad, in my opinion you were one of the best FPS out there."

I can recommend it often had Fun with it."
10963,This game have a huge potential but need more attention. There is stiil have more LAG on bullet and damage to to other charachter. and please add a A.I. aka BOT expert for quick match is make me piss off about the matchmaking.
10964,this new update is suck. this matchmaking is soooo bad.after this update you killed the game
10965,we have a lot of memory in this game but Unfortunately by the last update and changes this game is broken now and with 2000 players i think we have to say GoodBye. RIP BS :(
10966,This game was good bt now its shit and dead ... devs are too lazy to update or increase the game soul quality.. they r busy of shitty skin design so left IT :)
10967,"Black Squad is 1/3 Combat Arms, 1/3 CS:GO, and 1/3 Insurgency.
The movement is similar to icy movement of CA.
The game modes and game play is inspired by those of CS:GO.
And the gun play feels like a in-between the fast pace of CS:GO and weight of Insurgency.

While all of this does not a bad game make.
The fact that you have to wait 5 minutes to find a match in quick play really hampers my enjoyment of the game.
Either play a custom match or bring a book."
10968, let's keep this game up :)
10969,braindead developer banning players for no reason!
10970,"This game was real fun. I enjoyed the generosity with items and weapons that they give you for free. The only problem I have with the game now is that the player base is absolutely dead, which is quite a shame. I waited over ten minutes to be paired with anyone left. With so many other free shooters, I guess they had a hard time standing out and maintaining their player base."
10971,"It's a good game, just don't change the controls or you won't be able to use them. P2W isn't necessary, but heavily emphasized.

10977,very fun and enjoyable gameplay. But since the new update i can't get in any quick matches or comp matches and i liked how before the server were different not all grouped in one category furthermore roll the fucking shit back.

10983,When the last patch help more the low pingers and now the prefire on game its on FIRE !!!!! Because many of us we dont have yet optin fibre for internet! AND YES THE 60 WITH 20-30 PING ITS A BIG DIFFERENCE ON A MULTIPLAYER GAME!
10984,Nice Game definitely a good thing that I could come across it
10985,"The game is now a pay for Valofe's living expenses thing.

They first removed the ability to sell/trade certain skins through market because people was buying them for cheap through the market (not our fault if certain in game things were either overpriced or had the droprate of the hyperbolic return of Jesus)
Then, they promised that once crates containing Jesus were no longer available through the ingame-(overpriced)-market, then and ONLY THEN we'll be allowed to sell/trade items (maybe) contained in said crates, buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut it didn't happen 
After the sadly overpriced Valentine's box of past year all event boxes started to be bundled with temporary items that lowered the droprate percentage of permanent weapons, basically forcing people to buy the weapon they wanted through the Steam market because keys were still overpriced as a virgin nun.
Again it's not player's fault, but hey, money talks! And tossing 0.30€ in the market instead of giving THEM 30€ to maybe obtain what we wanted did hurt their feelings.
We NOW have to play for nearly 130 hours to obtain some boxes containing temporary crap
Till a couple of days ago WE HAD to play for nearly 130 hours to obtain a permanent name card, a reskin of some crappy weapon, tickets, BS coins some random stuff I never cared about
Months ago only 10 hours were needed to obtain a permanent card and nothing more
Months ago during events there it was the 7 days thing, giving BS coins, card and temporary stuff on the fly as we just needed to press a button and call it a day.
But since devs hate giving free stuff because players were hoarding medals and BS coins to purchase overpriced stuff through the market everything became null, we now have to waste our medals and BS coins to maybe drop a temporary weapon by purchasing an overpriced box OR purchase that overpriced weapon which is now on a possible rotation with them, it should be ok if we could at least obtain 2000 BS and 4000 medals at day, but we don't, so if we can't because they don't want us to, we have to pay real money for some crappy reskin that in the past didn't cost more than 0.50€

As it stands right now the game it's like the Korean version, we only fetch temporary stuff cause permanent crap HAS TO BE RARE, and don't even get me started with competitive mode cause the weapon you fetch by playing it, is once again a temporary one.

Let's also ignore whatever they did with the servers cause you are either lagging and getting killed after a no-reg, or killing something after wasting an entire magazine on it.

02/01/2021 Update

Ok, they banned me from their forums because I asked (with many other users) what was the BS Coins and Medal refresh thing, because we are worried that they may remove hoarded currency for the sake of their pockets, also I linked stuff from their website on which it says the droprate of impossibile permanent items because people was asking why they were tossing away hundres of € without scoring a single permanent item, they also didn't like my comment regarding Valofe toning down the game back to Korea version standards (which is now dead in the water) as right now everything including weapons that could once be bought with golds are now temporary because WE HAVE to play their stupid game 24/7.

http://www.blacksquad.com/category/drop_rates/

Stay away from anything published or fixed by Valofe and their greedy standards because it's not worth the time. Let'em die and forget about their products.

After patch 43, I and most of the other players who have a big ping cannot play. Thanks to the developers for ""-There are no players or playable areas wher ping conditions do not match"". An example of how to spoil the game for one update. R..I.P Black Squad July 28, 2017 - April 24. :cozycastondeath: :lunar2019deadpanpig: :cozycastondeath:. I loved this game. It's bad that I can't play it anymore. I marked this review as positive because I liked this watch in the game. I hope that the developers will return everything, and I will again be able to play Black Squad. And for now, only those people who have a small ping can play.

10998,Within 4 seconds of loading the game up it messed up my screen resolution and has a disgutingly basic and hard to navigate UI
10999,Vinny you binyot Why you no play schüt games?
11000,"Used to be a LOT better. Initially I favored this over CSGO once I saw the game, but yeah it went downhill at the end of 2018, fast. I'm not even over reacting on that part. Every patch and decision the devs make on this game is just making their graves a lot deeper. One important thing that got to me was the blocking of steam market buying and selling that would force you to buy their weapon ""dlcs"" and cashgrab loot boxes that has a less than .1% drop rate shared to all jackpot items. It's pratically worse than CSGO boxes to be completely fair. You can win a damn knife in csgo boxes than you can win any 2nd rate prize here."
11001,"1st Impression: Easy to master, aim is very smooth, some things are a bit weird for example the way to change the sensivity of the mouse (you have to bind +sens and -sens in the options to a button and then use it ingame (saves though) (acually its a good decision, it takes less time to find your sensivity). It is fast-paced like i love it, when you say its pay to win you are stupid, because the only thing you can buy are skins which you can use for a certain amount of time (i dont know if there are also non-""rent""- skins, but im sure there are. After some research there are definately XD). You can buy all weapons with ez at least at my level. Also, there are are some cs things in this game such as knife=sprint, the gunplay is like apex or like i think cod would play. I call it csod. I would definetely suggest it because its just fun. Of course i also didnt explain all there is, for example how many weapons there are (maaany). If you have any questions feel free to commend them down below... Wow, I could be a youtuber"

11007,Uhm how do I use my rifle granade launcher ?
11008,"The matchmaking system in this game is broken, literally have buffalos in eagle spots it makes no sense."
11009,"So on the one hand this is free to play and one of the least pay-to-win experiences you'll have. The guns are pretty much all available through completing challenges and daily stuff, skins for them are harder to get and you'll likely have to drop some actual cash but the skins don't offer a stat boost. The gameplay is frantic and fun, there's a lot of good gamemodes (if you go to custom games) the guns are cool and overall without spending any money it's a damn good deal.

Problems though: very little tactical gameplay (this sits firmly in the COD camp), hilariously bad hit reg at times (I've glided straight through the centre of a 16v16 without a scratch and been accused of hacks several times) though no always, some of the abilities (scorestreaks) aren't well balanced for the gamemodes and a lot of the weapon information is really inaccurate, which might annoy people looking for more mil-sim type stuff.

Overall it's fun, free but pretty flawed. Worth a shot though."

RANDOM BOX SYSTEM IS BULLCRAP I HAVE OPENED 1000 BOXES AND GOT NONE PERM SKINS WHILE MY FRIEND OPENED 10X LESS AND GOT 2 SKINS IN A ROW AND I HAVE SPENT MONEY ON THIS SHIT.
11065,"This game is average. Don't get me wrong though, it's a fun game in some of its aspects, but the game is lacking in gameplay as well as player base. As an NA player, I'm consistently troubled with the lacking player base, having to seek refuge into EU or Asia Servers. This is an issue, not only due to NS studio, but the toxicity of the player base. These both join to lead newer players away from the game, and it is rather unfortunate.  

This game boasts multiple things, the first it being a simple game but being enjoyable nonetheless. There's also a plethora of guns, each of them seemingly unique, but in reality all the same. Most rifles have a consistent recoil pattern, only really changing with rate of fire and bullet spread. All AK's, for example, have identical spray patterns and inaccuracies. The differences are rate of fire, and damage. 

Additionally, as a player starting out, there's a consequent difficulty in obtaining newer weapons. The developers do recognize this to a certain extent by providing timed weapon packages, but unless one has superfluous income, access to the steam community market, or extended hours to play, it's rather difficult to claim additional weapons. In addition to this, there are also some guns in the game that have no way to get them other than straight up gambling for them, or paying for them on the steam market. (SSV25). 

Skins are another issue, up until recently the game had been reliant on the steam market for trading and selling of skins available in the game. This unfortunately has been removed and limited to a series of weapons. Previously tradable and sellable weapons now are unable to be sold on the steam market. This is a small issue to the developers, though in reality, a huge one for dissatisfaction as a player. 

The game is also reliant on astronomical costs for cosmetic items, some requiring hours upon hours of gameplay or some requiring increasingly large amounts of money to gain weapons.

I cannot in good will recommend this game to any NA based player. The player base is lacking, gameplay gets stale due to the fact of astronomical prices and RNG of obtaining weapons, and simply the Dev's don't seem to care other than to earn money. Cheater accusations and legitimate cheaters are everywhere. Text chat tends to be toxic as well. I think at some point this game had potential, but as it stands now its just past its prime."

11087,"Summary:
Gameplay: B (78)
Balancing: B (75)
Playerbase: E, not yet F (but keep declining) (17)
Improvement over lifetime: D (new contents, but critical issue from 2 years old still not handled) (28)
Dev's/Mod attitude: D (Pulling stunts to bring player base back) (36)

Average: 46.8 (C)

46.8 < 50, not recommended

Gameplay: The game concept was well designed, and well made, in fact it's had perfect example how to make a good F2P system. Still have it's own flaws, but mostly minors and could be said one of the best picking game atm

Balance: The game keep getting balance changes, from buff and nerfs, retweaking, and now almost all guns, if not all, are balanced.

-Why a thumbs down?

Used to be promising (and still!), but until now... most critical stuff in the game aren't fixed (2 years old stuff!), nor get attention from dev. Instead of fixing their game, they make new content, new skins (milking players) and disabled trading (for best $ from skins)

-Hmm, what are they?

Let's talk about simple but critical stuff: 
1. No build in vote/kick system once in round
Yep! That's right! This game doesn't have any kind of vote system if the match already start, you can only kick a player from a lobby as a host, but that's it. You can't even vote maps u gonna play in non competitive modes.

2. No build in report system
Well, the dev have a killcam replay, yet forgot to put build in report system, kinda ironic eh? You cannot watch demo of your old match either. To report someone, you had to record his performance and submit it to their website for MANUAL CHECKING. Yep! MANUAL CHECKING and MANUAL BAN! Sure there's occasion of the battle eye caught cheaters, but now reporting afk farmer (will covered in number 3.) or a private cheater need much hassle, more if the cheater are kind of ""legit"" cheater which pretend they are not cheating...
After all of that hassle... If they got banned, what they had to do is just make new F2P account.... Great huh?

3. AFK farming
The game, like usual F2P system, has daily login bonus, daily objective, weekly objective, etc etc. Sure it's a good concept, sad that some people decided to farm those without a will to play. So they just set up some afk input simulator, basicly just pressing 3 (for knife) and then just mouse 1 (knifing ""nothing""). Yet the game didn't auto kick these afks (well if a player didn't input anything the game kicks, but with these kind of simple program, the game didn't kick). Maybe you gonna say, ""Ah it's just casual, what's the point"", but sorry, it goes even deeper! In several times, the dev let people get skins and unique weapons (that if u don't wanna competitive you can only buy a skinned variant on the market for hefty price for a replacement) and sometime had different stat with no in game equivalent of the gun. Can you imagine if the competitive also filled with afk farmers? Imagine u play with one more active teammate while 3 of another teammate gone afk, u cannot kick, u cannot report in game unless u record and sent it to their website, and accept the loss of the match even u just started (as stated in number 1. and 2.)

4. No ping limit
Yep, anyone who even had 250 ping are allowed to play, even if he is feeding, afk, u call it, and u don't have option to go competitive randomly without filtering those people, unless u do full team... which nullify all random chances...

Now, deep stuffs:
5. Bad stunts, a ""Timed DLC"" for ""Promotion reward""
https://steamcommunity.com/app/550650/discussions/0/1850323802574319946/
Do i had to explain more? The items inside are not permanent, yet there's no notification about it isn't permanent or only time limited, till the event ended. To get the stuff, u had to play 2 hours at least, and share the game to others, u are promised to get this dlc, when u get it, it's only 20 day and several in game currency (that are farmable)

6. Premium boxes low chance and free box chances reducement
-Ah it's like CSGO, everyone know it's lottery
Well, what if i tell you, if opening a 3$ box doesn't warrant you to get any skin, even u only buy slight chance getting the skin in the box? Yep u buy open a box to get a chance at the gun u want. Well market boxes one are, 100% but random, yeah, but now, it's the only thing that warrant you a skin (even shitty ones). Free boxes chances are reduced, u may as well getting a timed edition or just a timed useless cosmetics for character. Previously all of the free boxes guaranteed you to get a permanent items, ranging from shitty knife/skins (common), crap skins/knife (uncommon), medium looking skins / knife (rare), a good looking skin/knife (very rare), until a sick looking skin/knife/item (legendary?). But now even the odds are lower. Free box doesn't have chance getting legendary anymore, and along with the rest, now u get only 1/5 chance getting permanent, which doesn't warrant you getting a medium at least. Duplicate? Well unfortunately u cant sell/trade it :P

7. P2W
- What? I thought people say it's not P2W
Yep, in the past, i will say it's not, but now, there's at least 5 guns that aren't obtainable unless u pay or do 50 competitive for example in a month (WHEN there's event for that, i say again, >WHEN<) even unskinned one. 3 of them had unique stat that are arguably the best in their class and no in game replacement. Take example of G17 DF, a stronger version of G17, it has better accuracy than most pistol that have 50 damage or more + to head (which warrant 2 hs kill) and afaik only three pistol can do this, HNK45, M45 and G17 DF, while G17 DF are more superior than HNK45, another pistol is K9, u cannot get it without playing competitive or buying in market. AK Zhukov and SS25V, had same stat as their AK47/AK12 or M4 counterpart, but with unique scope, and u cannot get the scope in that same gun, unless either u play competitive 50x again in the right time or buy them in the market.

8. Playerbase that keep sinking
https://steamcharts.com/app/550650#1y
Do i have to explain? From 6-7k average (all time!) to 3k (march)
It takes more than 2 min to find casual match and approx of 15 min to get one ranked

Don't get me wrong, i wan't this game stay alive, but instead of fixing simple stuffs (1-4), they make more and more skins

Update: Wtf with those fake positive reviews? They didn't even review it right, didn't ever had a single paid game attached to their account and arrived at the most helpful review"

11106,Its a very good first person shooter game. I like it more than f2p fps games or p2p games. So yes i recomend this game!! :)
11107,For a free to play game 8/10
11108,All player just play against bot. nothing impressive at all
11109,at most almost 10h in-game time. I tried my best to enjoy this game but fk it total BS game from the recoil and damage output that I can't even understand how it actually works. fk it lol
11110,Plays like combination of low quallity smartphone shooter + Quake quallity sounds and graphical effects in a game that has maps that make you expect more. Community gets ignored and scammed.
11111,Unable to play
11112,"I didn’t expect much from this game, but I surprisingly enjoyed it a lot, especially the battle match mode. Black Squad is definitely worth playing."
11113,Good Game
11114,"Good free shooter. Has trading and skins, has lots of players and I realy enjoyed the time playing
"
11115,very gooood
11116,GoOd
11117,"most games: reload
other games: reloading!
black squad: 𝗧𝗮𝗖𝘁𝗜𝗰𝗔𝗹 𝗥𝗲𝗟𝗼𝗔𝗱"
11118,this game is very good :)
11119,nice
11120,great game. i just wish it supported controllers
11121,"I lost a lot of money because they closed the steam market. There is no way I'm gonna play a game of which the devs don't care about people that spend money on it. Too bad because I would've surely come back to this game many more times. But knowing that the devs care so little, I'd rather stick to roblox or something."
11122,"Its a good game... almost. There is something that makes this game not really good; the same map almost every time. recently Atomic Punch has been the map chosen almost all the time, which is boring. It would be a great game if it werent for this, as for now you have to play the same map all the time, which is boring since nothing new can happen at the same map after a few hours. Its the same boring procedure all the time."
11123,"Game:★★★★☆(I think this game is not bad)
Graphic:★★★☆☆(not bad)
Multiplayer:★★☆☆☆(high ping)"
11124,Ez Money :)
11125,"This game is boring, you get out of your spawn,boom, you get one tap.And again, again...Games should be fun, but piece of sh*t is not fun. BTW nice Pay2Win system."
11126,It´s a very good game!!
11127,"Garbage game(Neo Bricks and NS studio), basically dead after the 2019 Clan War event. Don't bother installing, even for nostalgia."
11128,beeing a free game is kinda cool
11129,great game
11130,fuck this game
11131,officially dead 3 dec. 2020 RIP
11132,nice
11133,Esse Jogo e Uma Belesma
11134,e p i c
11135,Like this game XD
11136,Could have been worse.
11137,"Seriously, I did not recommend this, I swear.
The recommend's just a joke."
11138,Takes 5 mins to load up and game crashes when you change any setting in options including senstivity
11139,It feels like a clunky Chinese CSGO. If you are into that then more power to you. But CSGO is now f2p and the better option.
11140,"I think this is a good game to relax with.It only needs to have some way of lowering the ping as I find when I see someone else,I have already been shot.That is not good.
"
11141,whaite screen thats it . there is no game .
11142,good game lmao
11143,"good game :)
"
11144,"I left CSGO to play this game and after playing it for months, i went back playing csgo. Sadly, there were no great developments and their anti cheat also sucks. To all new players who wants to play FPS, just go play csgo its free now so that we can have someone we can smurf on :D"
11145,"This is a good game, but i dont know why know this game is dying. Maybe the devs dont listen the player(?)"
11146,"The games has problems when starting up, usually I need to retry a couple of times or put into safe mode to make it work.
I also do not like the current deathmatch map pool"
11147,"WELL it's a Call of Duty Black Ops clone. which is mostly a good thing, especially BO #1.  I would recommend it only if you can find friends to join you. currently 301 people playing the game. now there are some good features in place that keep the lag down like ping restricted servers, quick match, clan and custom modes as well as jiggly boob physics for your character. SADLY, I haven't gotten into a server to PLAY a match other than PRACTICE and the TUTORIAL. I'm not waiting 5+ minutes to get into a match. I'll try back later in the afternoon, evening time."
11148,"Nice game for fps 
"
11149,"One of the best FPS Free2Play games for sure. It's like a mix between Call of duty and Counter-strike

Pros:
- No Pay2Win
-Ranked games for Solo/Duo and Full Squad
- 3 Sets of equipment that u can choose on every Roundstart
- Easy to learn but Hard to Master
- Free DLC's for new Players to test out most Guns before having to buy them.
- No Pay2Win
- Nice Seasonal events with Custom Maps/Gamemodes
- Cosmetic Weapon doesn't not have advantage over non-cosmetic weapon.

Сons:
- Too little maps
- To many Grenade Launchers
- Sometime FPS will drop to unplayable level. (Need to restart the game to fix it)
- Those who are still alive in game, they cannot see chat from dead
- Awful quick matches queue times ( There are times that i waited for 2-3 minutes)
- Feeders from winning team like to say "" EZ""
- People keep on spaming radio message

All in all a Good Free2Play shooter
The stuff u have to Pay for will not make u Win easy, but will bring u some Shiny Skins or a nice EXP/Gold Boost
I would rate it a solid 7.8/10"
11150,Good game
11151,guud
11152,very nice game.........
11153,"i like this game, but last update is too bad. 150 hp, i shoot 2 times from axmc and player wasnt dead. please, fix it"
11154,hey fucking blacksquad community can u fix this fucking bulshitt my server is SEA why i go to the EUROPE?
11155,I LIKE BLACK SQUAD BECAUSE ITS MY LIFE IS NOW AND NEVER I GONNA LIVE FOREVER
11156,"Waste my a lot time to this shit, I go back play my Rainbow Six: Siege much better.

Reasons:
i) A lot scammers
ii) Server bad than before, example high ping by no reason, problem is I play in my region server!
iii) No interesting content inside, just a simple FPS
iv) Gunplay feel too solid, nothing interested
v) New guns, maps and characters coming up too slow

Although I really like that no P2W this features, but...Ahhh, talk instantly to the point, [u][b]bored[/b][/u]."
11157,"407 hours playtime and when I get back playing this game for almost a year. Extreme lags of servers( internet's fine), buggy game, no improvements and imbalanced maps( same as before)."
11158,Fix Matchmaking because Lions are being matched with cobras and dragons(sometimes). How are we supposed to win?
11159,Great game!
11160,"Who says that the time machine doesn’t exist? These people definitely didn’t see this game. Although it really reminds me of the good all times, I must admit that nothing is overpowered, sound is pretty good, the gameplay is even better, easy to learn, free. Worth downloading"
11161,Please fix servers. I always get Disconnect from server (code: 0x00000000) every hour.
11162,gngh
11163,"Hallo, This is Adrian from Indonesia. I have a complaint for this game.
If want to start the game, there must be at least 4 people who are ready. It's very difficult, because sometimes the server is quiet. It was very difficult when I made a new room, and waited for 4 people to enter and be ready.
I really begged, so that at least 1 person is ready, the host can start the game. Please....
honestly I really like this game. Thank you so much.

Best Regards,
Adrian Hartanto Gunawan"

11173,"EDITED-READ THE UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM

Man, this game is so close to being great, but there are a couple huge flaws. 

Number one: the game is dead. I can only ever find custom matches, even at what would usually be peak hours for most games. This can result in ridiculously long queue times, sometimes resulting in no match found at all.

Problem number two (The Big One): I can no longer play the game. I can access the launcher, and press play, but the BattleEye consistently gives me a permissions error, even though I am POSITIVE I am the administrator, and that both Steam and Black Squad are running with admin privileges. Black Squad Support is completely useless, they just told me to install the game to another drive, which was not exactly an option for me. If any has the fix to this problem, please let me know.

I'd like to clarify, this game is really fun when it works and you can find a match.

---UPDATE--- (3/25/19)
I finally figured out what was stopping BattleEye from accessing my files. It turns out Windows Security Tamper Protection being enabled was the cause of the issue. After disabling it, the game was fine. I now recommend this game, but it would be nice if other people played it."
11174,Hours of fun for free you cant beat it
11175,Cs go free
11176,"GOOOD GAME
"
11177,Good game
11178,Gameplay feels way better than CS:GO.
11179,"The devs have no communication with their player base and feels like they have already given up on the game with long standing bugs, no improvements to game stability and a dying player count that makes trying to find a match harder and harder.
This game is just getting worse with more time.
Don't waste your time or your money on a game that wont change its way"
11180,Good!
11181,this game is fun but the clan matchmaking is sht it paris level 0 against level 5 adn i would like it fixed plz

11191,"ALL of my playtime went towards getting the game to load without crashing in the process...... hopelessly trying to get controller to work (even steam controller configuring doesnt seem to work with this game) after dealing with that i eventually give up trying and just play normal..... the game says nope basically cuz cant find any1 to matchmake with aka theres no1 apparently in the game to play with which leaves u with nothing cept the tutorial, thank god its a free game cuz i would have requested a refund for it if it even cost a penny."
11192,"Black Squad is the first and more then likely the last game i will review.
The main reason I'm taking the time to review this game is the bad representation it gets from 'salty' and 'unskilled' players.
I don't in anyway think i'm the best at this game or even close and that's not hard for me to say as this game has everything skilled fps gamers want and because of that has amassed a large and loyal player base of unbelievablly skilled players.
With that in mind you can ignore half of the reviews saying this game is infested with cheaters, but this in no way means there aren't any...but you could spend the rest of your life looking for a fps that doesn't.
Now that i've got that out of my system here is my review of BS.
The Gameplay: Fast paced if that's how you want to play with the possibilty to slow play in most cases, so csgo players will be at home in black squad with minimul hours invested.
The Gunplay: Personal opinion is that this game has the most enjoyable gun mechanics and play out of any game i've ever played...this is a game where your skill shines through and noob spays aren't a thing like in cs where idiots can 1 tap you without aiming anywhere near your head.
The Community: This is different for each person but i can give you my experience of it so far, You can always find a great group to play with but you will have to look for a bit as there are some toxic mofo's out there to, also there is no problem with diversity as this game is played by people from all over the world so there's a group for everyone! also if you are a skilled player you will no doubt receive plenty of salty hate messages accusing you of cheating in almost every game you play but that's all part of the fun.
Others: Great servers and low match making times, high ping restrictions in most channels, Great stat recording so you can see how you're improving and which guns you're tapping the most heads with, gun mechanics are extremly fun and can be mastered within hours of starting..no need to memorise spray patterns for every gun like cs [which takes many hours to master]
The Cons: Yes sometimes the match making isn't in your favor but that's how it should be..you're not meant to win every game and for those who say it's broken are literally just bad and salty, i personally have around 60% win rate and i've never reset my account or anything like that, just practice and warm up before you play if you want to win more and don't blame game mechanics or matchmaking when you don't.
Also a tip for new players coming from csgo to try this out, multiply your csgo sens by 4 and it should be the same if not very close. [ This is all from memory as i haven't been gaming properly for a while but i hope it helps you make up your mind on whether or not to try BS out ]"
11193,"very interesting combat game.
"
11194,"For me it's mostly the physical things about it. The initial release; the texture of it against my hands or body; the weight of it when on my body—things like that. I prefer Bristol scale [the stool chart that classifies the form of human feces into seven categories] type three and four, though I don't mind softer stool at all. I'm not really a fan of the softest—too acidic."
11195,"Love it!

Nice pace compared to other shooters. Great mechanics too."
11196,"games feels really nice to play, smooth and fun!"
11197,Good Game
11198,"It's a free to play FPS game, it's kind of like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive but not annoying. Really fun if you like MultiFPS"
11199,I like this game because is fun
11200,"FPS always drop,  freeze every second,  crash, high ping everywhere,  really bad game"
11201,"Its fun and all but the matchmaking and servers make the game not very fun for new players. I will admit if you do get into the game then its really fun and competitive but if you just started playing it for the first few hours maybe even minutes then its unpleasant. Some people will argue that ""oh just get gud kiddo"" but most cases people wouldn't say that because its true that matchmaking isn't fair"
11202,Good game rarely hak🔥👍
11203,I Love pubg
11204,"Fun generic fps game, but for NA servers, it's quite the dead. Quick match times take forever (10min waiting then I gave up). The only way to play is custom matches, but even then, it's not always the mode that you want.

@developers: if you notice your game dying like this, do your existing/new players a favour and reduce the daily challenge requirements. I would've stayed a bit longer if I could get any of them done."
11205,"This is by far my favorite FPS, although there are a few things that could be fixed, it's an all in all great game. I recommend it!!"
11206,VERY GOOD
11207,such a great game!!

11233,Good game
11234,"Glad to release in my region xD
Well sayonara gamescool"
11235,Yeah
11236,Fk yeah !
11237,I think that black squad is an amazing free to play game. I think that they should add real competitive match making to Black Squad and also add Team Communications. This would just take the game to the next level.
11238,"One of the few games that doesn't try to force you into some gimmicky objective-oriented mode. This is an old school shooter with unapologetic inclusion of team deathmatch and deathmatch, you know, modes people actually enjoy playing. In an age of games that try to force you to hug some stupid slowly moving objective or engage in some childish royale mode, this game sticks out and sends you on a nostalgia trip, back to when games like CoD weren't riddled with 13 year old hackers. 

Pros
- Smooth gameplay
- not demanding on hardware
- permanent ownership of weapons (no renting BS)
- hack prevention is better than so called AAA titles like CoD or Battlefield (pathetic that a F2P game outdid these losers)

Cons
- Graphics somewhat dated
- small maps (a turn off for some but I like the nonstop action)
"
11239,"A crappier version of CS:GO, complete with s h i t ton of monetisation, toxicity and hackers"
11240,Trash Update game ever
11241,WTF HAPPEND IT KEEPS ME GETTING KICKED OUT OF THE GAME .. ITS SAYAING THAT IM HACKING .. WTF PLEASS FIX THIS PROBLEM
11242,"Well if you are searching for a free fps game with many events , i recommend you this game. As for the game developer, i suggest you should try to fix the in game matchmaking such as quick match and clan match because they have the biggest event reward and people start to complain about the time of searching for room in the matchmaking. So please make this game more and more efficient in matchmaking."
11243,it takes forever to find a match i did not find a single match in 30 min
11244,pretty good i guess
11245,A lot of skins which is unnecessary and necessary things such as bug fix is not done regularly.A lot of hackers and many are not been kicked by battle eye.
11246,Go play csgo dont try it :(
11247,best shooter game

11250,"anti-cheat just does not working at all and you cant report hackers. many players have 100+ ping, but most importantly, hacks are free for this game, and the devs just dont give any attention to bann hackers"

11256,It's good game online
11257,"Pretty much like Warface with a way fairer shopsystem. Paying real money is totally optional since weapons can be bought permanently and that even quite fast. 

Pretty nice game, killing someone feels so rewarding and impactful. I dare say it feels a tad like Counter Strike during CSS times. 
Give it a whirl, it won't bite, unless you are a bloody amateur like me. Non the less a nice free2play shooter with an refreshingly fair system."
11258,best game fun and strong dvelping

11270,niceee
11271,"good game, very fun headshot mechanics

git gud kid
"
11272,"Honestly one of the better free fps games that I have played. All those people who claims there are cheaters are right, there are a few here and there, but other than that, this game is great for a potato PC, and beginners to gaming. Simple yet fun. Its basically a Korean CS:GO rip-off, and now that CS:GO is free, you might as well play that game if you want something similar yet different to this. Overall, 9/10 will play again.

On a side note, this game does require some form of payment if you want to get real good skins."
11273,Update sucks now the whole game is filled with smg peasants. Very unbalanced.
11274,Bad controls. No players. Overall bad game.

11276,good game irritating that you can't sprint though but apart from that its a good game
11277,"not saying there isnt room for improvement, but from the first couple of minutes, i just dont like it very goofy animation style, voice acting is iffy and grenade physics i just dont understand."
11278,its the big good
11279,yeah its kinda cool :)
11280,"Awesome game, highly recommend."
11281,"Maps too small, killing rate too low, takes forever to find a match, bad mechanics overall"
11282,what a nice game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11283,"Sadly can't recommend.

I actually enjoyed the 70 minutes I was able to play. After starting the game on the second day, after the first game I wasn't able to click on anything or even close the game using Alt+F4. Even after opening the game in save mode nothing was working. I tried putting it in Window-Fullscreen but then the game went to the middle of my 2 screens and I wasn't able to click on it to move it.
It may be, but I'm pretty sure it's not y PC since it's only 1 year old and has a i7.7700k and an Asus ROX Strix 1080.
Also the game doesn't really seem close to being finished."
11284,goood!
11285,Good game
11286,"Some of the maps are really good. Some of the maps are pretty bad. The community is non-existent so you will not really be chatting with people while playing. The guns have a bit of damage and rate of fire issues in regards to being OP or under powered. That being said: the game is free and is pretty fun if you get in a groove.

Things the Devs could easily do to make it really good:
Make matchmaking automatic after the last match ends.
Make the attachments removable/add on different attachments.
Make the magazines shoot the right number of rounds, for example the HK417 has a 20round mag but shoots 30 rounds.
Add more skins maybe even just basic ones like red, blue, yellow, etc.
Allow adding friends via steam rather than via the in-game system.
Clean up the front page some and make the game requirements /differences more apparent.

This game has potential."
11287,Nice community if comparing with CS
11288,"Pros: 
Good optimization

Great anti-cheat

Soundtrack

Constant flow of new content

Less bugs than I expected


Cons:
Surprisingly bad graphics for 2018"
11289,"     It's a lot like Ghost Recon was.  All the same problems too.  People using Aim-Bot
ruin it for the rest of us who just want to have fun.  You can tell when they're cheating
because they don't even have to aim.  They can pick off something the size of a dime

11290,"2+ years ago this game was great and I loved this game, I am a melee player with 60k+ melee kills (mostly on nimravus), melee was fun to play but hard, it requires good aim, good strategy, good moves, fast reactions.... And it's sad to see that this game is dying. When I first started to play this game there was so many melee rooms now you are lucky to find 3 rooms. The biggest mistake the developers made is when they merged all servers together. That's the day when 100's of melee players i know stopped playing. Another reason is there's so many no regs and bugs and glitches that they don't fix. This game was fun but now it's dead and the developers don't care about our opinions. RIP BLACK SQUAD"
11291,This game is dead. Waited 30 mins still couldn't find anyone in quickmatch.

11294,"pro's: skill less community, so its ez to frag or outplay

contra's: Blackscreens, freezes, kicked by battle eye, high ping has advantage, destroyed by updates, toxic community, insults en masse, haxers and bs ignore it.
Hv fun!

OK, BS worked hard on banning cheaters, thats why nearby 50% of the daily playing community got banned (not even joking), specially in the highranks. Blackscreens, freezes got patched, but no more allchat available, caue of toxicity of community. Its still fun to play, if u r not trying to hard or u hv some... tolerance for askable acting of ur teammates"

11325,"Разработчики не знают про существование подбора по рангам, уровням им всё равно на это, могут кинуть в игру как и с новичками так, и с заядлыми геймерами, которые нон-стопом играют в эту игру. Так же разработчики не хотят привлекать игроков стараться над контентом, режимами и скинами, добавляют лишь обновление для того чтобы сделать вид занятых.

11332,no
11333,Cheaters everywhere ! A lot of people play with hacks and the few times when the system recognize them it just disconect them with the posibility to reconect ! And we do not have the posibility to REPORT those people (it literally does not exist eny way to report them at the end of the game). Another thing  is the competitive games when 8 to 10 games someone quit the game in the first round and make us lose the game ! And last but not least the match making in competitive is fu**ed up.. no balance at all. In one team buffalo and in the other team Lion or Cobra !

11335,"Unplayable not compatible with windows 10

but now its full of pingers that teleport fps drops(even though i have a pretty decent graphics card), forced to use the 32-bit version cause the 64 doesn't run and there is no fix for that

*edit : now yesssss"
11338,"Very fun and polished fps game, the competitive mode is quite good (very similliar to cs go's 5v5 demolition mode) and the free to play aspect of the game doesn't affect the gamplay in any way (as in i assure you it's not pay to win at all).
I do advise however to play the game with friends, since it makes the experience a lot better."

11370,"SOUND

The whole sound stuff is terrible (I'm a sound designer/engineer). From steps to shells dropping and gunfire, everything sounds like it was made by some random kid living on a bunker with no headphones (maybe not the underbarrel GLs, only because the sound of the explosive leaving the shell is funny (funny, not accurate). IT'S FPS meaning Surround is a basic need not met (from what I heard it's basic Stereo Mix), audio mixing is so terrible that steps can be heard at the same intensity with a player walking right over a corner you're in, or on the other side of the map. The bare minimum would be adding different mixing options (like CS:GO) so players can decide whats feels best for each one. Overall audio sounds over compressed.

ABILITY OVER TACTICS

The gameplay heavly relies on ability. That's OK for fps BUT an equally important part of fps is tactics and guile. The approach Black Squad has on the maps I found amazing, tactics and specific places are much easier to communicate if you have official designations (in this case, numbers) on the map. BUT it's useless unless you spend straight 100+ hours on this game to develop the skill. Competitive players always have an edge, not because they're better (I've seen some poor or nonexistent [aka manhunt] team tactics), but because they play so much their muscles are already used to the movements, mouse sensitivity, and whether a pixel shot on a specific location hits the wall or the player (which is natural and essential in competitive fps), so it doesn't matter if you put 5 CS:GO sheriffs with map knowledge to play against a level 0 clan team, skill prevails over tactics and that's ridiculous. Another reason why this happens is that the ends of lurking paths are almost always camping spots, so players exploit this design to perform manhunts instead of pulling things like meta lurking or getting from A to B, or B to A unseen, they're just pixel shot shortcuts along the map. Long story cut short, the game seems to prioritize getting kills over getting the mission done. And that brings up a question of what is the purpose of this game? Free CS:GO alternative? Competitive focused fps? General purpose fps with a competitive scene? These are all big shoes to fill and the game will need serious improvements on map/tactics/shooting mechanics to try matching the current market. All of this brings up the next topic, that I see this skill problem being a part of, and constitutes an inherent design flaw of the game.

GAMBLING

Aesthetics are a part of almost every fps out there. I get it. But skins in this game seem to be the moving force. You play a lot to continue buying/winning crates that have a ridiculous chance to give you a rare skin that will be over U$50 for a month, then developers will release a new patch to introduce new skins via crates and prizes that will put your wow priced skin at U$2. This forces devaluation of skins in the market, undermining the money put by players on aesthetics, and forcing a new skin-trend that makes players buy more crates and keys and direct purchases on the market. It's a heck of a deal for Steam and NS Studio, but it's disrespectful with the players money and time invested on the game, and it creates a drug addiction like behavior: you play a lot and pay for developers to indirectly scam you into playing a lot more and paying a lot more. Basically it means that if you don't have the skill, you don't win the matches that will give you skins, so you have to keep playing to get better and win those skins. Then, boom, you won the match and miraculously the crate gave you that rare skin you always wanted. If you sell it now, you don't get to show other players how dedicated you are, if you sell it later,  there's no value on it, so you have too keep your skills up (which means playing continuously to get the next seasons reward).
Next argument on this topic is that everything is chance based, even with real currency, so you can buy 3 crates and earn U$50, but you can also buy 7 crates and get U$0.5. From the consumer point of view, it's very offensive to pay for those bullets if the game won't compensate directly for a direct investment. At the least, if you're spending real money in-game, compensation should be certain, otherwise there should be no real-currency based system to keep the game strictly chance-based (then you trade your skins on the market). This logic of buy-my-currency-to-try-to-get-a-chance has the smell, look and feel of a studio with foul market practices trying to rip off it's costumers. Only imagine if your hospital rolled random number generators to decide if they're operating your knee, treating it with pain relievers or ripping off your 
 entire leg. This is a game, not a gambling machine, and Steam is a Store/Market, not a casino. Again, this logic embedded on every game mechanic forces the player to keep playing (the random box comes to mind) so he or she gets a chance to win something. Players should keep playing because they find a game is good and/or because they're good at it and want to keep being good/improving, not because the game uses every opportunity and mechanic to force the player onto addiction.

BULLET PENETRATION

It's nice to have a game that understands some objects can be penetrated by bullets. but these things come from the weapons caliber more than they come from the material ahead, putting a sticker on cardboard boxes just makes the game feel stupid and discourages players to try out other weapons and therefore other tactics. Let's see the camping spot behind wooden boxes at B bomb on Castle map for example: If a player decides to camp there, you can hide behind boxes and wait for someone to get on the door behind and try to plant, so you kill them, or, they enter by the door on the front and you kill them. Either way, you actually only have to worry about one door, because if the opponent instead of planting searches the camping spots, it's a 50/50 chance depending solely on reaction time. Supposing penetration was accounted for, the opponent instead of using the standard Sr-47, ak-47, ACR, ak-12, M4 Custom or the newer M4A1, could use some high caliber never-used-in-competitive-or-even-casual weapon such as a Mk46 or Pecheneg to sweep the bomb for campers. Not only this would bring whole new combat tactics to the game but would provide different gameplay experiences as well. Also, it would change the economy, because these never-used weapons would have more value in their skins.

PERFORMANCE

When I started playing, a lot of maps weren't there, competitive wasn't yet the thing and the game didn't have voice communication. Today I have a new PC (9th Gen Core i7 + RTX card + 16GB DDR4) and I get the same FPS I had with my old Alienware notebook (2nd Gen Core i7 + GTX 560 SLI + 16GB DDR3). When are performance improvements/optimizations coming?

UI

God forgives NS Studio when are you guys overhauling the game UI? When I open the game it looks like I'm trying to play some MMORPG through a Fortnite based UI from 2005. Combined with the overall graphics, it makes the game look amateurish, and that's the impression I get every time I play."

11410,Fun Easy to play but has many TrashTalkers during the game
11411,"Enjoyable game, highly recommended if you like CS-style games, but quicker and with ADS on weapons.

An important thing to mention however is that because of the relatively smaller playerbase player skill in matchmaking is broad. This means if you of lower skill levels that you'll randomly be matched with people that have made this game their job. Vice versa; if you are of higher skill be prepared to be called a hacker every (other) match.

Another thing that's important to note is that the Europe server is the most popular. Because of this people from outside of Europe will be matchmaking on the servers. This means that after 11PM CET the game can become a near unplayable experience because Americans who refuse to use their own servers will be running around with their 180 ping. - The developers need to find a way to incentivize playing on their own servers, since them not playing on their own servers makes the problem of nobody using their matchmaking thus more people going to the Europe server worse.

What I think is the best option for NS-Studio is if they go with a more general matchmaking system find in games such as CS:GO where the matchmaking always tries to put you into local servers first and only when matchmaking is unable to find local people it will push to increasing the range of locations of players.

Regardless a really fun game that I hope has a long life ahead of it."
11412,"got so many profit for selling a item in this game , really recommended hope the developer make the weapon skin marketable again"
11413,Good..
11414,"this game has nice graphics. The game is a time killer. 11/10
"
11415,"After countless hours put into this game, I have came to conclusion that this game is only going to get worse because the developers will not listen to the playerbase.

Before you read any further, the bottom section is all the negatives if you want to just skip to that part.

Here is the breakdown:

Gameplay:
The gunplay is extremely satisfying. The impact sounds when you get a headshot and multi-kills never gets old. Every guns is perfectly balanced and only reflect on the players aim skill. I did notice the the AK rifle was superior in almost every regard, but it was not gamebreaking at all. Basically, every gun is viable and is only determined by the player's skill and play style.
For example, I preferred heavy machine guns because they had 100 rounds, shot fast and did high damage. Meanwhile, some players might prefer an SMG because of movement speed and high rate of fire. The point is, there wasn't a balance issue at all and was very well executed. 

Controlls:
Controlls were smooth and fast paced. If you enjoyed Counter Strike, this game will suite you to an extent. It is slightly faster paced and a bit more chaotic. You can aim down the sight of your gun as well as use the crosshair in the center of the screen. It functioned very closely to COD in a good and clever way.

Content:
The game has a lot to offer in terms of content but its also missing valuable assets to make it better. It has your standard Team Deathmatch, Demolition, etc. One thing it certainly lacked was maybe a Free-for-All mode. There were countless times where I was playing with an odd number of friends and forced one of them out just so we can have balanced teams. I feel like these things should be considered. Minor complaint, but thought I would throw it out there.

Now its time to get into the bad stuff and to why I quit this game all-together...

First off, the matchmaking is absolutely terrible and an unblanaced mess of crap. The game ""supposed"" to place you in matches of people with similar scores instead of similar ranks. So if you're a private and are really good at the game, you will get matched up with someone who may be a lieutenant and kick your ass. I cant even count how many times I joined games and lost 8-0 because of how awful the matchmaking is. Its been like this since I started playing and the devs still wont do anything to fix it. Instead of balancing the the awful maps and terrible sound design, they would rather fill their pockets with cheap cosmetics and loot boxes. The maps are too large and completely unfair. Players cal literally thow grenades across the maps and land kills everytime. And lets not forget that every gun in the game had a grenade launcher. Which means everyone can spam it and get cheap kills. The sounds aren't loud enough either. My teammate can be right next to me shooting and i wouldn't hear his gun go off. How the hell am I supposed to hear any enemies nearby???

The point Im trying to make here is that you shouldnt waste your time with this garbage. I already wasted my time with this review. The devs wont listen to the fans and would rather stuff their pockets with money from lootboxes. Thats really it. This game is literally a scam if you put any money into it. I warned you."
11416,ez
11417,"Queue Simulator, It's so cool to wait like 12 hours for a game , seems pretty fun tho. U gotta try it mate :) !"

11425,"It's good. I don't play it as often as I used to,I play CS:GO now,but it's been a nice adventure.
The reason why,is the game doesn't work for me anymore,but this is only on my laptop,later when i get a better PC i might actually be able to play this again. It's a good game. I don't say it's bad. You should play it if you get the chance. I played it in early access though,I honestly don't know how it is now. (This review is edited thats why) It's like CS:GO,but there's a few differences that you don't really see until you play the game long enough. I played it with my brother,he liked it,and started playing it on his own.

Overall,this is a good game,and I like it. If you get the chance,you should play it. This is a quite OK subsitute for CS:GO. So,I do recommend this game to people.

This is an honest review."
11426,I like  this game because no P2W

The game itself is fun to play, Decent Combat mechanics, a friendly learning curves for anyone familiar with First Person Shooter games, the devs.... well what can i say is the devs are Listening to the players.

i'd recommend this game to anyone who looking to sunk many hours into this game. but if you doesn't have the time i can't recommend this game."
11437,nice game
11438,"This game is just for the losers that have been playing the game so long that all they do is beat up on the new players......

11443,Baal er game
11444,"The maps for this game are beyond terrible. Worst I have ever seen and will ever see. 
I have noticed they have added some more maps for TDM since the last time I have played.... I have seen people with downs do better. If they want this game to improve they shouldn't have maps that have 3 paths to choose from I.E left right mid. 

Honestly I only play this because of friends and its free. Never in a million years would I pay money for this trash. Go play CS GO instead better to put your time there then here."

11459,<3
11460,cannot open game for singapore
11461,"New update sucks ,new update made me quite bs :( the most of good streamers(scara epikki) are not interested to game now .fix this asap or u guys will loose ur playerbase"
11462,Before it was a good game. We played it lot. But after update this is a no skill game. Just smgs. Smgs ara really op and many of us not playing now. More than 20 member active clan is going dead now.

11464,"he guns are easy to get, and there are none locked behind a paywall. Most of them are trash though, so you'd end up having to pick from a really small selection of them to be able to actually kill anyone, but as they can all be bough fairly easily, it's not gonna be a problem."
11465,"Muy buena alternativa al csgo, despues de años de jugarlo no pense que fuera encontrar otro shooter al cual alternar de vez en cuando, una de las cosas que me hizo cambiarme fue el anticheat continuamente estan baneando hackers y es raro toparselos juegas mas tranquilo eso si algo toxica la comunidad aveces, pero en fin vale la pena y lo mejor no cuesta nada . :)"
11466,"take this as it is but i dont think there are as many cheaters as everybody says there are but they do exist.My point is
that people when they are mad are rly good at blameing someone else for there mistake or maybe a bad day you cant be godlike every game sometimes you have bad days and for those people its very easy to say ""there hacking"" or walls or maybe aimbot Hell ive done it before ive wrongfully accused someone of hacking then the next day i get in a game again 
with them and find out i just had a bad day BUT KEEP IN MIND IM NOT SAYING THEY DONT EXIST IVE ENCOUNTERED A FEW BUT EVERY GAME(my game i mean other games not every sing round in black squad)HAS THEM SEIGE COD CSGO CSGO ESPEECIALY just please after your done playing think did they rly cheat or did they just play better than me or maybe just maybe they had better cursor placement witch would explain the wall hacks or a lucky prefire or just game sense or instict just calm down before you go accusing people and rationalize before you send that video to the black squad report site please"
11467,This is a good shooter.
11468,"simply mixture  of Call of Duty + Counter-Strike: GO = Black Squad (even the mixture of maps)

Black Squad, in general,  CS:GO lite or the free alternative.
unfortunately  CS:GO now free  so players divert to csgo.
but still this game deserved  to try at lest one time

"
11469,"Fun F2P game 
Easy as hell Grind System but with the ability to buy anything you want with real money
It looks Pay to win at first but again the grind is not a barrier at all so you can have a great and equal experience withouth paying a cent
"
11470,This could be a really good game. Unfortunately it is totally ruined by the amount of cheats and hacks being used. If people cannot win without cheating then what is the point? The hacks need to be stopped otherwise this will become another cheaters paradise (actually it already is!)
11471,This is a quite good f2p fps game
11472,nice game
11473,"FULL OF CHEATERS, YOU CAN'T REPORT ANY PLAYER FOR ANY VIOLATION."
11474,just got false banned PogU
11475,just very bad
11476,No players on NA server... game sucks... :D
11477,"Real good game, should try it out everyone."
11478,Game is Nice
11479,s'good
11480,"The game is very good, BUT the competitive needs to be fixed. As of now there are people that should be in buffalo or wolf that are in eagle, lion and cobra. The games are so unfair because you get stuck with bad teammates. You should also be able to queue with more than 2 people. Not just solo/ duo or a full squad, also need to fix how Elo works, if you keep it so that you need a certain Elo to play with friends then make it so you can also gain Elo based on how you play not strictly wins. Competitive right now is so unfair and is so stressful, K/D should be a factor so that the players are placed in the appropriate  ranks and competitive will be more fair that way. I rate the game an 8/10 and probably the best free to play out there but the competitive needs a big change/fix as soon as possible because as of right now going to highest rank is almost impossible solo."
11481,"The Devs broke their brain when they made this game, game does not run on virtual machine, Batlle eye -0 regestry error  BEClient.dll missing from batch folder."
11482,"PLEASE FIX THIS SMG SO MANY SMG USERS SO ANNOYING
PLEASE DEAR BLACK SQUAD 
"
11483,very nice
11484,"We need a solid ""Demo"" or Match-replay system to report and stop cheating. And I am getting an in-game LAG, I don't know if it is because of my old hardware specs. or ping, but it is certainly there and it is impossible to play with it. An In-game chat system would also be appreciated. Apart from these issues, game is solid. Oh yeah...one more thing, the animation for bringing the sniper out, is very long, which is not ideal for this type of game (my thoughts). If Devs. could cut the animation time for more faster game-play."
11485,NO ALT F4 ;(
11486,nice
11487,nice
11488,White Screen Simulator!
11489,You know its p2w when there is 4 currency and you need to buy granades
11490,Good game
11491,Game does not work if Docker is installed. Please fix anti-cheat so that the game can work if other tools I use that provide the freetime I have to play games can be installed while I play.
11492,Great game with a decent community. Wonder why this game not popular enough.
11493,"Definitely recommended. I'd like to call it CS on steroids. Quite nice mechanics actually, I never faced masses of cheaters in-game, it's ideal for a few quick matches. Guns could be more balanced though as well as how the game balances teams. The new game modes can be fun, it mostly depends on your team - your sole efficiency not that meaningful when you face multiple targets. Currently it's not pay-to-win, most of the paid items just pure cosmetic, they do not affect the actual gameplay. Hit boxes are pretty decent too. Definitely one of the most playable games."
11494,"the game give the noops good guns and the pro player they give thim shity guns and they give the noops post in the guns and the game is a big shit and yhey want mane only and its so bad games

11501,You  do 1 thing to improve the game and ruin the game with tha unwanted weapon balances!!  Nerf smgs if you want to keep the existing player base or they ARE going to quit because of your dumb decisions.
11502,I'm still called a noob and I completely agree with this and because I have only been playing for about 3 days and this has been my favorite game ever!
11503,It's okay I guess

11507,It 's very good game 10/10

no cheaters , lots of good guns and free chests 
no need to grind for ingame currency
the game itself is simillar to csgo but has its own features 
graphics   -  8/10
gameplay -  9/10"
11509,Very good game xd
11510,"Decent game, wish it was easier to hop into the comp / matchmaking side of the game, the cosmetics are nice and well made however the developers need to focus less on that and more on ironing out the game's rough edges."
11511,....
11512,nice game
11513,"it it good
"
11514,Tried to find a game took over 10 minutes so i quit and removed it from my library.
11515,it's ok
11516,It´s freezing all 20 seconds.
11517,it's kinda entertaining but has a lot of hackers that ruin the experience.
11518,shit game
11519,Black Squad is pretty dead. Map layout too bad.Cheater everywhere.
11520,its fun but when you progress its kind of boring add new game mode
11521,fun game
11522,"The game could be fun, but the actually kill someone you have to unload a full mag on him."
11523,"0/10

Stupid game , bad shooting mechanics , wild fps drop and my machine is quite good and  I have decent fps on most games  . Especially when you turn around the corner . Retarded recoil patterns . Guns behave irresponsively most of the time. Very slow movement speed . Completely random game zero rationality . What happens in a shootout is determined by luck , not by skills or your decisions ."

11548,Great game Great DLC love the game.
11549,"This game has is totally dead. It's not that i just tried and I was too amateur to handle it. I've spent more than 2500 hours in it at around 2 years. That's why there are no clans and middle players any more. It's bigger problem is hacking. And the devs do nothing about it. Yes, you can send a ticket, blah-blah-blah, and maybe they will ban the cheater after a couple of weeks. No point as he can make another account to continue boosting his friends. Nobody is banned for boosting. In the meantime, all these disappointed players seeing that the game is unplayable, they will abandon it. It's just a hacking competition. There is no point of trying to play the good old game any more. It's dead. Thanks. Bye"
11550,Cs go
11551,aika nice
11552,"Awesome game, good players, lil toxic but NO WHERE near CSGO or CoD. Good graphics, smooth fps and sexy guns, what can I complain about?"
11553,Even Tho Its Free But Its Like Naaaaaaaaaaaasi Lemmmmak
11554,PLEASE ADD JUMPSHOTS FOR SNIPER
11555,"This game is good and really fun, There are some bug like a constant white screen when logging in which i have to Alt + Tab to fix but the game is so fun. The game requires no pay to win. I think the game is pretty dead but if the developers worked and fix the game a bit it should be fun."
11556,"Fun, but it's pretty dead."
11557,"Pretty good game for an F2P. But as with 99% of f2p, p2w games. It has its drawbacks. Like hackers, People in areas of the world that shouldn't even be allowed internet connecting into your lobby with their 300 pings.  I did spend 20 USD on the game for in game purchases. The system seem to work well. Not sure i like the card set up. But it seem to work. All in all i game the game a thumbs up. Because what it cost vs how much fun you can have.. You just cant beat it. I have a friend who plays all the time and never spent a dime.  Most f2p games get boring with in several hrs if you dont spend money. 
Great job guys! Too bad the guys at H&G didnt follow your model."

11565,"This is one of the better Free-to-Play FPS games. Surprisingly not a lot of hackers and the cheater bot system does a good job of locating and kicking hackers. As far as weapons and skins it seems to be a really fair game as all the weapons have the same specs and the only thing you pay for if you choose to pay is the skins. This gives an equal opportunity to paying and non-paying members to play a fair game. You don't get a super powerful weapon just for paying money and that makes it fair. Plus the skins can be acquired by opening ""random boxes"" using the gold you earn in game and you earn a lot of it so you won't run out quickly. I currently have over 2 million gold and don't know what to use it for lol. Overall this game is very good, graphics are great, maps are nice. There are a few minor issues here and there but overall I would give this a 9/10. Definitely worth your time. :)"
11566,"fuckin dope, run around doin a shoot is fun"
11567,"This game is shit a csgo knock off csgo is free now just play that lmao
"
11568,"If you are into first person shooters, and you are kinda bored with CSGO but CoD is too much, this is the golden middle. Guns phisics are great overall, there are a few bugs and gliches I wont lie, but the game is so much fun. Various modes, a lot LOT of guns to choose from. Also I have to say, competative mode is becoming better with every pach, now it realy looks like A FPS. 9/10. I am hooked. Its free, try it."
11569,love this game...... :) :)

11579,the game is like a zula europe but better
11580,i like it
11581,"So far, no players.
I gave it a shot at around 1am CET.
I tried the top four of the ""quickplay"" gamemodes, and waited over a minute per mode. I got no matches for oponents.
I then tried practice vs bots. The bots just stand there. No movement. No return fire. Basically the AI is non-existant.
Luckily it's a free to play game, so I ""only"" wasted my time. I wish I could have gotten that time back though, since I got no entertainment what-so-ever from this title.
"
11582,we want killcam to make sure the enemy dont use wall hack or aimbot . i thing meny players are cheating in game and they dont kick from anticheat. so we want killcam to see how they killed us. we love bs for years so dont make it sad at the end :(.this is our right !!!

11589,Cool game to play
11590,"I love playing games about tactics. Fallout:Tactics? I played it. Heck, I lived it. X-Com: UFO Defense? More like X-Com Best Tactical Game. When I saw Black Squad, I was excited. It looked like the perfect fix for my tactical urges, and free no less! I downloaded it and waited in eager anticipation with my tactical sunglasses enhancing my vision and my tactical mouse pad ready to go. Imagine my surprise when I load up the game, and it's a CS:GO knockoff! Not only that, but it has the audacity to be LESS tactical than CS:GO! The unmitigated GALL! Disgusted, I threw off my sunglasses so I could write this seething review without my tactical predisposition. 0 out of 5 stars and an utter disappointment."
11591,"As a conessoiur of the tactical genere I can say that this is one of the WORST. I didnt play the tutorial and when i joined a game I didnt have a gun? Where is my gun game? I got shot at a lot and had to try and stab people and take their guns. unfortuently I would almost instantlky be killed when I picked up an enemy's gun and have to restart from the begginging. 4/10 stars, not nearly tactical enough"
11592,"GGGG
"
11593,"It was fun for a long time, but nowadays I can't say the same.
There are ""some"" problems in particular:
- The community is growing, but players usually immature and toxic.
- Most players instead of helping for a beginner, they will just being angry because you are ""noob.""
- There are some methods for being AFK, and this ""party"" is growing too, not giving any shit that the team will lose or not.
- Using boxes or playing for it is nearly hopeless, because it have a very little chance to get any not basic weapon skin. 
- And all of time favorite stuff for me is: using like the half magazine, and the enemy is still alive, and while most of players shoot you in a matter of moment, despite using tap weapon or not. I am not a pro player, and don't have like 1k hours in game, but as an average player I am not that bad and still don't believe that huge difference on shots. And it's not only because of reflex or luck. I would know what's the real problem; I tried to practice alot and it's not going to change in any direction. I am tired of that, that's for sure.
- Some shoot doesn't registrated well, and it's also not rare when you being shooted but actually you are behind a wall (as evade the continuous shots), and may only a 1-2 shoot is which should be scored on you, but no, you will just dead...
- The developers should take a look on some weapons, because most of them weak compare to tap or meta ones.
- The weapons is very similar to each other (in stats) and nearly only the meta which can be make difference.
- Newly it's not rare if you find yourself against a hacker, and developers don't give enough attention to solve this problem. It's not that chaotic now, but in the future it will be in that way.
- Most updates not about to improve the game itself, but skins, skins... and skins.
- You need to play alot to get keys or boxes, which can be really annoying, and if you get even them, you need to open many to get any usable stuff in most of the time. 
I know, that most of the problems which I mentioned is about the community and not the game/developers itself, but it's still there and there are two options: live or live without it.
I need to mention also the ""pro"" side:
- Free, and easy to get any weapon without skin.
- Many map and weapon pool and map type options.
- Good graphics
- Many events 
Aaand that's all which coming to my mind...
I hope that the community will change in a good way, but I doubt so... 
Anyway, definitely worth to giving a try. Gl to you all."
11594,"not that bad

11595,rly good
11596,like mr.poop

11599,Nice game to play with friends.
11600,"just to flex on you virgins, we have a girl in our discord server. btw this game is terribel. cod but made by a fetus"
11601,No . I hate the supports
11602,Cant hold right mouse button to aim only toggle.
11603,"It's a fun game, once you get in, but the wait times are unbearable. They can be longer than the matches."
11604,"Honestly, i couldn't even get to play the game since i got stuck on the tutorial. How? I died and wasn't able to go back to the area where i was getting shot at, as it was closed off. You know it's bad game design, if when you die during the tutorial. You have to reset the ENTIRE tutorial just to get back to the spot you died at. Review will change depending on whether or not i actually get to play the game. It's a mobile game..... Ported to PC..... What?"
11605,"Good game, good game. Although, its annoying sometimes cus you get triggered, but other than that is good."
11606,fucking love this game. regular updates. new modes getting added and free items. its one of the best free shooters ive ever played
11607,"This was a very good FPS, but i started to think the devs acidentaly made a good game bcuz they have the worst support ever, now they don't fix the game, is only skins, skins and skins every update. Game is full of hackers, bugs and netcode problems. I miss the good times of Black Squad, but looks like it will be just memories, sad but i dont recommend anyone right now to play this game ez"
11608,It should skin-squad
11609," An okay fps, nothing special, it could be fun if you want an free fps, look like PointBlank."
11610,"so fking awesome 
"
11611,515
11612,Awesome game. Best game. Its one of my main games now.
11613,"My account was falsely banned. When I contacted Black Squad support for any kind of proof for me to deserve a ban, all they said was basically , ""nope, someone reported you so you are banned"". without giving any evidence of me comitting an offense. 

I can post screenshots of my sad blacksquad experience if interest arise

Black squad is whack, banning players who actually gives their dead game a chance just because some 8 year old in Yugoslavia told them to."
11614,"The map I played on allowed you to basically spawn kill and by far the most rigid gameplay I've played in a long time, as free to play goes, its ""okay"" not greatly fun, nor greatly boring. Basically a bit meh..."
11615,good game very interesting game combination of COD & CSGO
11616,we want killcam to make sure the enemy dont use wall hack or aimbot . i think meny players are cheating in game and they dont kick from anticheat. so we want killcam to see how they killed us. we love bs for years so dont make it sad at the end :(.this is our right !!!
11617,"nice gamw but more bugs in it 
pla reslove it"
11618,I think therew is na problem in update i am kicked out again and  without any reason. Please solve this problem!
11619,"well i just play team deathmatch and it's so much fun !
really enjoy it"
11620,its good but 60% ar cheating or using macros
11621,Game sucks and dying don't play this garbage.
11622,i got banded after update path Very Good!!!
11623,"I recommend this so much Cauz It has few cheaters only
Like
chert667"
11624,gg
11625,"The description of this game should be updated to read ""The most UNPLAYED game on Steam."" Thankfully it's free, because I have not been able to find a single active server for over a month now."
11626,12313
11627,:)
11628,WHY I HAVE ALL TIME 800 PING ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
11629,Better than CSGO ;D
11630,"Ok, so Black Squad or Sh it Squad as me and my friends call it, for its never ending bugs and server issues and non existant NA scene we just cant seem to leave it. We uninstall almost every week but end up reinstalling a couple of days later. There is just something about it you cant find in any other shooter. As much as I would love to just stick with CS or R6 I just cant stay away.

Just a friendly note to the devs, FIX YOUR FU CKING SERVERS. Why am I teleporting with 50 ping like I have 500+ also having to play on euro servers from the northwest US just amplifies this problem by just a near unplayable state. Having to hit someone 5 times in the head before they die then you just end up getting tapped once in the head like you didnt even shoot. 

Update 1:THE NEOBRICKS MANAGERS GOT REMOVED XD

Update 2: NS Studio promoted one of the newer community moderators to a community manager and abused their power less than a week later.

Update 3: The other Community manager is banning innocent players and refuses to talk with BSCC organizers.

Update 4: The community manager is attacking people and BSCC's for no reason 

Update 5: That CM got fired ;)

Update 6: They deleted my support ticket calling them out on their issues 

Update 7: Tried playing the game had endless rubber banding, I'm no longer allowed to work for any BSCC because of something that happened with the old CM's and me over a year ago that was settled peacefully. Told my boss that I gave away confidential information and never spoke another word of it. Thanks ""professional Developers""

decent game :p"
11631,Looks and plays like CS:GO and Call of Duty online lovechild
11632,Good
11633,"Nice game, as my personal opinion it gets boring after a couple of matches. One big problem of the game is that there’s no as many people as before. Overall good game to try."
11634,my first shoter game but i think its best shoter game. :D
11635,BattleEye is the fucking problem.. no support telling us how to fix this moron BattleEye issue
11636,"The game before CSGO became free,full with players. Now, only the bots are left."
11637,played my 1st game...full of waller..uninstall
11638,Not so bad
11639,thats good game
11640,xd
11641,"the game's pretty good you die very easily but it still drives you back its not p2w aswell

ps: i got 10 dollars skin for free just cuz i leveled up maybe im just lucky"
11642,very good fps game
11643,Best Game For Make Free Money !!!

11646,"Black Squad is a solid Free2Play Shooter, with some good features and no Pay2Win involved. 

Pro:

- Good Clan / Clanwar system.
- 3 Sets of equipment that u can choose on every Roundstart.
- Many Settinngs to mess around with.
- U can run it on a Toaster plugged into a Potato.
- No overpowered stuff.
- The Gunplay feels Good
- Nice Seasonal events with Custom Maps/Gamemodes
- Active Community / Community Managers.
- Ironsights/Aimpoints on every Gun
- Easy to learn but Hard to Master
- Costom Game Rooms
- Dead Players spectate on First Person
- Guns are not expensive to Buy
- Free DLC's for new Players to test out most Guns befor they have to buy them.
- A Box for Ingame currency where u can get Knifeskins from.
- Soundplay works perfectly in this game.
- U can mount a silencer on nearly every Weapon ingame, exept some pistols and all 
Snipers.

Contro:
- To many Grenade Launchers.
- Some maps are really confusing for beginners.
- TDM maps are just mirrored Maps. (at least it makes it balanced)
- To many Grenade Launchers.
- Clan Emblems only as a reward.
- SO FREAKING MANY GRENADE LAUNCHERS!!!!
- Confusing UI if u launch the first time.
- No Gun Custimisation. (espacially for Scopes/Iron sights)
- To big Viewmodels of the Gun ( but thats my personal opinion)"
11647,i hate it
11648,More than COD! :D
11649,"게임을 잘 만들어봤자 뭐하냐고
개판 운영에 핵유저 난무하는데 신경도 쓰지않고

2014년 한국정식 출시부터 시작해 별계급 달정도록 지겹게 했는데
2017년 스팀으로 넘어오면서는 Early Access 으로 써놓고 개선한건 1도 없음
벌써 2019년인데 언제 정신차릴거임?"
11650,"please remove Claymores from this game, thats all i die from, to annoying"
11651,"I think this game is fantastic alot of ways. First, the gamplay is fun as heck, the guns are amazing, and the game is well made. Now I do have one complaint, it takes a log time to get into a round. I sugest that there should be a server list were you can hop right into server instead of waiting for the game to find you one. Overall, the game is fantastic and I recomend 9/10"
11652,Best free multiplayer game i ever played 10/10
11653,pretty good 10/10 good graphics needs more people tho
11654,very nice game. loved it!
11655,It is very complicated and a pay to win
11656,"one of the most cheat infested game ever!!!!!! 80% of players are using cheat like aim cheat, wall cheat (they can see you even hidding behind the wall) armor cheat and all sort of cheat!!! what a waste of a good game. filled with cheating lowlife scums!!! what to expect it a free to play and the support is if not below it's equal to zero! no matter how you report cheaters they still do nothin! this game is a free to cheat game! what a waste! it's a good game if not for the cheaters and the zero support. as if there is no support at all no use reporting!"
11657,"this is a must play free to play shooter I really enjoy this game I like a lot of the content they have in this game that being said I hope they add more content and keep the community strong!
only bad thing about this game is not a lot of Americans play so we are forced to jump to the Europe servers.
8/10"
11658,The best CS f2p game out there
11659,gggg
11660,Good game as from what I have played before. I will change my review if things get worse.
11661,csgo but free... then csgo became free...
11662,"This game was fun for a short amount of time, but then I really experienced it by playing demolition. The maps are so terribly designed for the gameplay it just isn't any fun. 4/10."
11663,"This game is going downhill rapidly. Developers are only recreating skins over and over, no fixes for bugs, no original content worth a damn, and we won't even talk about the abundance of blatant cheaters and the lack of ridding the game of them."
11664,good game mby ?
11665,"just dont play it please 
more cheaters in 1 game than legis"
11666,pretty good game reminds me a lot of a lot of older fps games i grew up playing.
11667,Best real time fps game that I've ever played!
11668,This game is so good and the best free game u have ever played.So underrated need more attention.
11669,"Game has massive potential but is badly done, Recoil, Sound and Maps are wacky."
11670,Not bad
11671,u gotta fix bugs before adding more skins :p
11672,good
11673,"In the time i've played this (not recently) I loved every second of it. 
- Solid gameplay
- Visible headshots actually register (unlike cs)
- Went 90+ in a game with 60+ headshot kills. got called a hacker. (happens almost every game)  Yeah I use this hack called my hand. 
- Community is sub par
- Maps are sub par 
- if you're good at fps you can feed your ego on this game 
- made 100$ off this game from crates (dont buy them please dont) I just got lucky.

Conclusion 
- If you really have nothing else to play and i mean NOTHING else to play. Give this a shot! This game filled the gap of ""gaming limbo"" i've been stuck in for awhile. 
-Rating:  6/10

 
"
11674,"COD but better..

Takes forever to get in a match, but supperrrr fun!"
11675,"i use to like this game but now is trash cant belive i spend most of my steam money on this game fix the game and stop adding useless stuff,oh yea and also can yall gimme my money back please"
11676,this is such a garbage game
11677,People F@cKing Camp Way To much. Like you dont need skill to win games You just need to sit in a coner and get easy kills.
11678,this game is awful.
11679,This is very nice game
11680,game's broken.

11684,hello
11685,"better than cs go. give it a chance. soon you will see it. maybe not at first match... but you will see it soon.
im on 90/10 Win/Lose MATCHES in 2vs2. 
Zero confirmed hackers
only 2 player we are not sure about it.


@dev pls add 2vs2 ranked !!! pls"

11687,this used to be a good game but now nearly half of the players are using auto aims. all one shot. so i am asking myself why do i need or want to play this game...
11688,Joss game
11689,One of the Best free Fps game
11690,Best free game
11691,"the game is self is fun, if you can get it to actually work. I am about to uninstall and try again. 
1.) it wont let me change my sprint key from anything besides the scroll button on my mouse 
2.) when ever i try to change a key bind, it goes back and my computer starts bugging and i have to restart it (its not my computer because it runs way harder games everyday like squad) 
3.) it takes forever to launch and will just leave a plain white screen

DONT GET THIS GAME IF YOU ACTUALLY PLAN ON MAKING IT A GAME YOU PLAY OFTEN 
let me add that in order to have a good load out, you need to purchase better weapons than the base ones they give you, you cant level up and get more which is BS. This game is free to play but not free to win."
11692,"This game is good enough to replace Crossfire and Warface (I miss playing as a Medic though). None of that Pay-to-Win crap here, but my problem with this game is the amount of Skins, Effects, Trails that feels out of place like i'm playing a GMOD server with all that weird crap like that dude with futuristic armor, mad scientists, hearts as trails and glowing hearts around their body? Not to mention that the game has been randomly freezing and crashing in the middle of the match."
11693,bad CS copy
11694,The Developer are good they are listening to the BS community.
11695,it was ok
11696,HVH
11697,"Awesome game, Everyone should download it. Im actually really happy that the devs made this."
11698,its best game that you can play instead of CSGO so go ahead its easy to play and me and alot of my friends love it. its very intresting game
11699,"I installed this game for free on Steam. It is an online first-person-shooter game with very rough gameplay and character movements. This is not the best free multiplayer FPS on the market as it claims to be. It is a cheap, slow and choppy version of Counterstrike. 

There is nothing very unique about this game and I do not recommend playing it.


"
11700,"it's ok game but there is one very annoying bug (for me, that's for sure). sometimes i can't zoom in/out or shoot, first i thought my mouse broke but it works perfectly in other games. please fix it asap. sometimes you have an opportunity to get a triple kill but you will just bug out and die."
11701,good game
11702,this game if fucking lit
11703,"Honest opinions? I feel like in a universe where games like CS:GO and COD are not eating up the market, and all fps games are popular, Black Squad would rule. This game feels like an excellent fps which is lacking enough popularity, and don't let my hours fool you, i've played quite a bit of it in my 4 other accounts. Black squad is an excellent game. The gameplay is absolutely perfect, the graphics are very high-quality and smooth. The community is quite average, as i have ran into the typical few who tend to get salty over a game. The matchmaking system doesn't seem too off, i almost always find players around my skill level and the maps are well-thought-out and strategic. 

Conclusion : Should you download it? Definitely. Give it a try, and maybe you'll fall in love with it.

Overall its a solid 4/5 game. I love it and am definitely looking forwards to future updates.

-PPD"
11704,Its an impressive game from graphics and sounds prespective and has decent gun and shooting mechanics (though it feels like easy and generic) . But i only enjoy it 10% of my time in game and thats when no hackers/aimboters involve (90% chance to matchmake with at least one hacker). So I ain't going to spend any money because of this.
11705,"Okay let me get this straight.

The game reminds me of Blackshot, Black Squad is perhaps Blackshot 2.0 substitute the old ver. of Blackshot.

The company & team of Black Squad is indeed smart in fact they have skins/items which can be sold to steam market for people to purchase which is totally a game that increase the population of the players for the game & the economy.

Also, the game itself is a nostalgic game.

Very fun, I also addicted to the defense AI game. I play for hours and hours of the gameplay.

Worth it, or not. It's hundred percent the best game that for people who invest for.

Edited edit: I still playing this game till this day.

Edited edited* edit: This game starts to become shits.
As some players I played with are fuckin' hackers, and I always in the losing games.

I might as well giving 50% of thumbs up and down for this game as the quick matches are becoming not quick. For examples, 16v16 destruction takes at least an hour to play and other 8v8 are sometimes need 30 minutes to get into the matches which are total ridiculous."
11706,chinese with guns
11707,After playing for like almost a year the game is fun especially with friends
11708,we can`t talk in game and it`s very bad for this buti game please edite this
11709,"Operator. After checking the game, the server will pop up. Operate properly. It's really annoying.
After checking today, it was Ping 80. I go to 300, and I keep on trying to compete.



Operator. I raped Lapelkill 20 kilos before I check it out. Why are you going down?
It's getting thinner and thinner."
11710,"Damn game, cheaters, fckers, everywhere! Trash game。 Do not allow cheat script or you are trash always.!!!!!!!!!!!"
11711,Good Skins and nc Graphics
11712,Trash
11713,"just not good at all spawn campers to the point i cant walk 5 feet out before i get sniped i uninstalled before even finishing my game
"
11714,gju
11715,Camp in a corner with an SMG = EZ WIN
11716,Game is not good.I think its for the kids
11717,Very Good Game
11718,"I do recommend this game, but the cheating needs to be dealt with. I will actually be deleting the game temporarily. I will check back occasionally to see if this issue will be worked out. It's a great FREE shooter really. Really smooth play. You could be a great top 3 player all day long, but on certain matches, the cheaters will unfairly eat you up, destroying every FPS's main goal... a good K/D. This game has potential to mess your K/D up in just one match with a hacker. You will notice several matches with cheaters, just trying to finish the daily's."
11719,Fucking good game
11720,best game
11721,"This game is Awesome, If you like Call of Duty games, and other First Person Shooter (FPS) games then you may like this game. The weapons are unlocked like in Blacklight: Retribution with currency called Gold, Medal, BSCoin, and Bullet. It has a PvE gamemode that most games like it do not have, but it also has PvP gamemode that includes your team deathmach. Overall I really like the game. You should give it a try."
11722,I like putting milk before cereal. Tell me I'm wrong
11723,this game is pure cancer
11724,"good game i love it wish u all good
"
11725,"+60fps (i have a potato laptop)
+no p2w weapons just skins
+fun
+easy to learn easy to master

-literally garbage map designs

9/10"
11726,"Its fairly fun gun play is nice and theres not even a glimpse of pay 2 win only thing you can buy with real money is skins 
but Im not recommending it cause fuck any game that has sentry guns in it"
11727,Amazing!!!
11728,"Quite a nice f2p shooter. Not P2W like most other f2p FPSs.
Some classical gamemodes are just fine, but the ones where you have to use classes and skills are totaly unbalanced, and need some serious work done. Quite sadly, that was an issue from the very start, but it seems like developers just don't give a shit. 
The guns are easy to get, and there are none locked behind a paywall. Most of them are trash though, so you'd end up having to pick from a really small selection of them to be able to actually kill anyone, but as they can all be bough fairly easily, it's not gonna be a problem.
6/10"
11729,"Very nice game cool graphics and gameplay compared to other games still lacking competitiveness. Apart from that, its a paradise.
"
11730,Yes
11731,"The game is cool, not pay-to-win. But it have a few bugs and server issues, and the box sucks"
11732,"awesome game
"
11733,it was a good thing i found it!
11734,"Game is Fun and also Free.

The game consists of micro transactions however that being said it doesn't feel pay to win and many weapons are available and you can get them relatively easily. Also the sound effects are pretty neat, the game has a good player base and killing someone in this game definitely feels satisfying. I would definitely recommend this game to all FPS lovers out there."
11735,"its pretty good i just hit 134 hours on it and for the first time in the game i got a very rare skin the AEK973GL BLUE REAPER
for the first 4 boxes! they increased the chances of getting rare skins and i can say that im getting better at the game i get more headshots than i did when i first played its a good game and that we shouldnt hate it cause its not pay to win but be grateful that we can play the game for free and progress without spending a dime unless u spend for skins like me so i hope and pray that they make this game better and be grateful."
11736,"noone plays it
"
11737,gg. XD
11738,pretty good movements and easy to play too one of my favorite fps.
11739,"GREATEST GAME EVER! FULL OF TOXIC FILIPINOS AND CHINESE HACKERS ~ LOVE IT! ALL KOREANS ARE CONSIDERED ""HACKERS"" BECAUSE WE'RE JUST TOO GOOD MAN. BLACK SQUAD? MORE LIKE SLAP SOME FILIPINO ASS SIMULATOR LOL!"
11740,"this games makes my peepee real hard, some of the skins are too good to be true"
11741,Very good shooter.
11742,"best FPS ever...
At some cases better than CS-GO...

"
11743,fun game but only if you can get into a lobby. sometimes you start into a game right away but most of the time your waiting for players for 5 to 10 min if not forever trying to start a match. if they would fix the server issue it would be great fps.
11744,pretty dope!
11745,nice
11746,This game is better than COD titles.
11747,"After playing 4 Rounds Iam totally disappointed, the different Classes are completly unbalanced!
Having a sentry gun turret deployed will grant you any unfair advantage possible!
If you like CoD and abusing unbalanced stuff, you definatly should try it, its free!
But for me its totally infuriating!"
11748,"Had to change it to negative. This game was better in the past, new devs made the game worse lmao."
11749,Bang bang
11750,"umm no, all the newbies got lucky box gun and me nothing. see ya."
11751,"Its actually a really good game, but the developers are just disgusting and this game is dying, they didnt fixed a single bug in the game since 2 years, so i would prefer to find another game to play."
11752,<3
11753,"mix of cod/csgo. seems like a lot of fun and hasa a bright future when it will have some big updates coming
"
11754,"So, this game is pretty good. only downfall... The sound. No matter what enviroment you are in the foot steps are alway loud and there is no echo. Kind of annoying for someone that is trying to be emerged in the game. Oh, and the PVE is terrible as well."
11755,"i get about 200 fps and every time a aim i get crazy stutterying anyone know how to fix this the game is unplayable
"
11756,HMmmmmm!
11757,"You have these small ass maps, and you add attack choppers, century guns, and claymwars, to much for 1 small ass map, and noob tubing is getting annoying, grenade launchers btw."
11758,"Liked it, needs changes to guns and how you get money, i shouldnt have to spend a whole day grinding to get one gun...."
11759,"Why im still playing:
- Not PAY TO WIN
- Full of Events
- Fun Community

"
11760,"Best free to play game and very fun. I, Myself was quite surprised when i first played it couple summers ago. im honestly excited to see how weel it runs on my new desktop. I'd definetly recommend playing this game
love it........"
11761,good game but just a lil problem some guns i earn from box dont be added to my steam inventory!
11762,NA region is dead
11763,🤞
11764,"Good game, Very welcoming with many DLC's for free, Realistic Graphics, Good Physics and not so toxic comunity"
11765,❤️🥰😍😫💦
11766,"I really, realy, like this game, but...

- NO TEAM KICK/BAN feature to punish ""stopped players"".
- Rewards is really bad designed... people log in, stay stopped in the match and guess what? WIN THE REWARD... seriously?
- Some earned guns dont be added to my steam inventory!

EDIT:
Play for a long time, Win 8000 BS COIN, Purchase Weapon == NO TRADABLE, NO MARKETABLE.

Are u guys kidding me?

I'm going to CSGO..."
11767,Possibly the best F2P shooter on Steam.
11768,fine game just not for me you dont heal back up after fightin you stay low hp and the maps are all pretty small atleast the 3 or 4 i got to play on
11769,"Like: Good grafics, Fast framerate on midrange hardware. Good gameplay.
Dislike: Often accused of wallhack, aimbot, noob. Getting penalty for disconnect in competitive gameplay even when teammember(s) getting upset and want you to leave."
11770,Black Squad is mindless fun. If your looking for a FPS that's FTP and easy to learn I suggest this game to add to your game library. I have played about 15 hours and already own about a dozen perm guns and even with my oldman reflexs and eyes I have about a 1.4 KRD. Also with the current events there seems to be plenty of ways to get even more cool stuff. Give it a try you have nothing to loose and you just might like it.
11771,"Black Squad is a great game , my favorite graphic compared to the other similar games , you can get money from skins , and it's an easier FPS game . I played this game for years. Many people do bad comments to this game saying that it's full of cheaters , but you must believe that in this game most time it's when someone see a player better then him he call him cheater while he's not. We can find cheaters yes , like all the FPS game , but i think black squad have less cheaters then the other similar games. And when you report correctly a cheater with proves and evidence they will ban him.
And about the people who says that's the game is doing only skins , it's not right because they do new things too. They do many skins to make money so they can evolve the game. They need money to do it so they make new skins.And it's a small group. So it might take time so everything get good or evolved .We got voice chat recently, everyone was crying saying that we asked for VC long time ago and they didn't. But when they did it , not even all the players came to use that voice chat , everything what they know to do is crying because they want everything very fast.

SO DON'T LISTEN TO THE BAD COMMENTS , YOU SHOULD COME TRY THIS GAME BY YOURSELF TO JUDGE , and i think you won't regret"
11772,good game i got call an hacker because they where bad i feel sorry for them to be that salty
11773,"       This is an extremely good first person shooter considering that it is free to play. There is a huge variety in weapons to choose from so it can fit almost any players style. From full on machine guns and snipers to karambits and smoke grenades it holds hours of fun! The gameplay is fairly good even if you don't have the best connection as long as it's stable. I personally have not noticed that many cheaters (MAYBE one or two, or they were just really good, which is possible). There are about 10 maps I'd say, and about 15-20 different game modes. Then there are slo several different game finder options. In quick match it either takes you to a random match or you can do practice where you spawn bots and find all the different spots for throwing grenades from, etc. Custom match is actually easier to find a match in because it can take a while for the servers to find a match for you in quick match. In custom you see a list of rooms that people have made with different modes and maps in almost every one. You can enter one of these or you can create your own. I ususally play custom because I can play sooner, but if you play quick match you get rewards. So it's kind of a matter of preferrence. There are also clan matches and tournaments. I'm sorry I cannot give info on those because I have yet to actually play a match in them.

       The only time you have to pay is to get bullets to buy guns with skins. Most of them you can buy without the skin by using currency earned in-game. I think there may be one possibly two guns that can only be purchased with bullets but I'm not certain. You can also buy a few different characters, but that does not affect anything other than looks.

      Basically, this is a completely free to play and no pay to win first person shooter that is actually good! I would recommend this game to anyone that likes shooters. I hope this review has given you a bit of an idea about what the game is like, and I also hope it will help you decide whether to get it or not!"

11778,"fun and really good, but has a lot of bugs and lag is everywhere. please fix the fps drops and no hit register issues and this will be a great game."
11779,awsome free 2 play game
11780,If csgo and call of duty made a baby you got this
11781,good game
11782,"If the devs of this game decide to implement aussie servers, then I'll pretty much be playing it every day"
11783,"It may be technicaly not the worst thing you could posibly play but you realy:
a)had to have zero pride in yourself to touch this 
b)be realy desparate for a crappy F2P shooter. (and this one is more F2P than shooter btw).

It's an idiotic mix of VERY VERY VERY VERY low TTK of your call of doody (even lower), a pretty slow ""tacticool"" movement system - 
slow walking that makes noise, running with your knife and even slower walking that makes no noise - of CS or something (but even slower and clunky), awful weapon balance and design choices - ala one-shot-at-any-body-part sniper rifles, no-spread-no-recoil-no-skill SMGs, everything-kills-you-at-1-2-shots-but-this-thing-takes-at-least-2-and-more shotguns, which are going hand by hand with absolutely unsatisfying to use weapons - no feedback besides awful tacky ""bullet hits a piece of meat"" hit sound, not punchy sounds, no recoil, SLOW RELOADS, SLOW SWITCHING, SLOW ADSing with sniper scopes but extremely fast no animation ADSing with everything else...and on top of that - awful menus (korean F2P game type of awful. Isn't it one?), awful maps that consists of chockpoints and routes that are leading to chockpoint, awful netcode (""every death feels like BS"" type of awful. And it's prob one of the reason why shotguns are so bad) aaand it's an awful greedy F2P.

IDGAF that it's ""jUsT cOsMeTiCs"" because:
a)Gambling. Lootboxes. Crates. Keys.
b)Timed crap. (i.e. you can rent weapons and skins, you have to rent grenades and etc)
c)This game wants you to buy stuff on every corner at every moment. All menues are designed to make you open a lootbox, to check the shop and etc. It's pretty awfull when you know about it.
d)Those ""jUsT cOsMeTiCs"" are pretty awfull and give you a disatvange - those top tier character skins are glowing. (like unusuals in TF2 but full body) and it's a pretty big glow - you can see it around corners and stairs - really helps to get an advantage.
e)It's not """"jUsT cOsMeTiCs"" - you have to buy weapons and rent greanades. And when I checked the premium shop had many more guns than plebeian shop - to the point that normal shop had only 1 sidearm on offer and premium at least a dozen or something.

So, overall - if you really really really want some F2P shooter with low TTK then maybe you can try this (and be dissapointed). Just don't waste your money on this...this.
Instead I would recommend looking somewhere else - like Dirty Bomb if still alive, Ironsight was a bit better than this last time I checked, CSGO is now free. Or just pick up some cheap grey key for BLOPS2."
11784,"Normally I have a lot of fun playing this team FPS - however lately it won't load, and all I get is the music like the game loaded, and a completely WHITE SCREEN. All of the other games in my library work just fine. It's just Black Squad. Can anyone help me fix it?"
11785,"Pros: 


1.) It is a lot better than Combat Arms. A LOT. I hate Combat Arms in comparison to this game.

2.) Sniping is fun, not a lot of quickscopers

3.) I really like the reward system for constant play, gives fair and balanced rewards and new guns

4.) Guns at the moment of writing this are cheap enough to obtain easily

5.) Destruction 10v10 game mode and the Daily Special game mode are really fun and change up the FPS gameplay

6.) In-Game weapons earned or bought with in game currency are still competitive with the weapons you may buy in a micro-transaction

7.) Varied Currency system, some weapons are bought with up to 3 different types of in game currency, helps keep you collecting different types of currency as you level up so you can still purchase SOME special weapons just by playing the game

8.) Holy crap they actually mount red dot sights on pistols I love that SO much more game devs need to get with the times of modern pistol mods.

9.) You get a suppressor and laser on most guns directly from spawn and you can take them on or off in game in real time, that is very nice compared to other games where you have to have it equipped or unequipped before the game even starts.

10.) Good amount of map diversity

11.) Really nice graphics for a free to play FPS.


Cons:


1.) When quickscopers are there it is annoying

2.) Needs some more keys to unlock random boxes in my opinion, almost balanced.

3.) It would be nice to have some new guns added to the game other than reskins

4.) You cannot customize the attachments on your firearms, no different sights, no improved suppressors, no muzzle devices, etc.

5.) No killstreak rewards unless you are playing 10v10 Destruction, and it isnt rewarded based on kills, but how much damage is done to the objective. That is not an issue, but it would be nice if there were some sort of kill streak rewards for doing well in the game.

6.) Grenade launchers have a somewhat small kill radius, they act like you're shooting a 20mm grenade or something but these are 40mm's guys, they should have a slightly larger kill radius.

7.) Some of the stuff given in random boxes are fun but sort of useless in game, like a graffiti tag spray can, where you can tag the walls or floors like this is Tony Hawk's American Wasteland or something. It would be cool if the players could design their own tags inside of an in-game editor, sort of like how Call of Duty Black Ops let you make your own emblems. They could add some logos and symbols or special colors that you could buy with in game currency to help add diversity to what you can purchase in game.

8.) They sort of give too many good guns to everyone timed for nothing, I fought a whole team using the M4 Red Dragon Custom and it was really annoying because they didnt use any weapon variety. Was really overpowered. I mean it'll run out in a month, but I think a month is too long. Make it a week or something.


Overall: 


I would give it a 7.5/10, for being a really nice & balanced free to play first person shooter. I would rather play Battlefield 3 but, do I really want to buy Battlefield again and have to start over from my Xbox Live account? Not really."
11786,"Thought this was a cool game, but boy was i wrong. This game is only intended for people that can't afford to buy COD games. Cause this game tries to copy COD and somewhat CS, but in an awful way. It's graphics are crap, controls crap, movement and gunplay totally crap. It's really crap, although free crap. But not the right crap for me."
11787,fun game!
11788,"The game is ok. But its just that, its that kind of game that you download, play for a few days then get boared because the gameplay is always the same and delete it. Graphics ar good but gameplay ist just boring as...
Guys just dont waste your time"
11789,"Jumped back in after awhile.  The maps are still trash.  I had the choice of 2 whole shotguns.  Either the game has gotten worse or...no, the game was always subpar.  Now the game is just trash.  Go play Ironsight or something."
11790,GOOD GRAPHICS
11791,"Hello,

I'm playing this game since a time now, but with time, more and more cheaters started appearing.

After MANY request from the players to make an in game report button, they did not care about it, what did they do ? well they keep adding new microtransaction skins that no one asked about.

As it is harder to submit a cheating ticket than to create a new account, well you guess what happens next, you'll find yourself with games ruined most of the time because of wallhackers that will launch all the 5 players grenades into your face even if you were hiding with not a single sound being emitted.

Well, I'm tired of hackers, just google ""black squad player base"" to see how much this game was good and became the cheaters land with time.

Thank you."
11792,Fun game even though it has quite some microtransactions.
11793,"I found the game to be pretty good,but I feel there should be a server in South Africa as we tend to get pretty bad ping from the existing  servers.The game glitches quite badly and it is not easy to shoot some-one who sees u seconds b4 u see them."

11806,"I downloaded this game as an alternative to Crossfire because Crossfie in my region is full of hackers and its Pay2Win
Imagine Gambling for a gun with cool skins and effects plus it reloads 2.5x faster and recoil is non existant

Black Squad became my shining light in finding a decent Free to Play FPS Game and this game didnt disappoint
I manage to buy my favorite sniper rifle the 50 cal in not too much of a grind plus I have the Skorpion Machine Pistol as a secondary. and lastly your gun either has a grenade launcher or deal 2 shot damage

Overall a worth it Free to Play shooter though I would wish more game modes like Zombie Mode or something"

11818,its good for 0 bucks i reccomend it
11819,"I loved this game at start, but the skill gap between good players and new players is too far. You have to learn it the hard way. The AI in this game is okay."
11820,"I used to enjoy the game but after coming back to it after a while I'm constantly bombarded with issues. The game used to run great but now it just lags all the time, Sometimes when I try to enter the game i'm just greeted with a black screen that doesn't go away, whenever i try to adjust my settings I'm ALWAYS greeted with a black screen and the time it takes to load is too long. Why the fuck am I getting these issues now when it was absolutely perfect before."
11821,This game is so much fun. But the reporting system of this game is bad. If you strike any hacker in this game you can not report that player directly. This is. A big problem in this game. And the problem of d-sync will ruin your gameplay.
11822,"this game is fun and does not work on a pay to win format, yes many of the cool skins and other items need to be bought because grinding for them is almist impossiblr, but other than that this game is in my good books!"
11823,"Great classic FPS shooter, lots of fun to play with friend as well."
11824,Its ok
11825,When the game first came out it was a great game.  Now it has been taken over with hackers.  The player base is on the decline and it takes about 5 min.  to get on a map.

11832,Best Game Ever
11833,"I've been playing this game for over a year. 

Here's my honest opinion.

The first months of this game are a nerve wrecking mess, you either play good or get laid out. 

After which you start to get the feel for the game and understand its mechanics, then you can truly start competitive.

Once you start competitive the order goes:
1) OMG My team mates suck.
2) OMG I suck. 
3) NVM I'm a legend. 
4) NVM They're legends. 
5- kghjilion matches) F-dsçpa cheaters. 

Welcome to Black Squad, the most Bull**** game in existance.. 

PS: Oh, I also forgot to mention, NO REGS ALL AROUND. 
You see one guy, you shoot his head 3 times.... 2 are no regs the last one hits. 

And no, it's not because of my ping, it's because of bad design. 

Oh well, overall, still an addicitve game.

PPS: 2 years has past, This game is a joke. Love it."

- meta weps on Comp like AK/SR
- Pinglimit for Comp less than 80ms"
11846,"Absolute sh*t, every update is all about skins, skins, and skins. No updates on fixing the actual game. It also lags for no reason at all. It's still on early access and they don't bother with fixing the game much at all and Black Squad just focuses on making new skins.

Edit: One year later and it has gotten worse. A summer update caused frames to drop to the point where the game is just unplayable for me.

Edit 2: August 8, 2021. Game is still garbage lmao.

Edit 3: August 28, 2022. ^^^"
11847,"This was a very good FPS, but i started to think the devs acidentaly made a good game bcuz they have the worst support ever, now they don't fix the game, is only skins, skins and skins every update.

11881,"Black squad is by far the best first person shooter on steam the controls are fine there is harley ever lag and weapons are balanced. But the complexity of maps is horrible I swear its just wall wall wall random bench heree wall wall. There is alsow the issue of the types of currancy Black Squad has 4 types of cureency gold, metal, ammo and something else gold you get by completing matches and challenges metals you get form ranking up and challenges but ammo and the 4th type of currency are no were to be found I have spent a good 20 minutes trying to figure out how to get these currnecys and the only way i have found is to buy them with real life money. This both sucks and is also a good thing, this is a good thing because you only use these currencys to buy cosmetic items such as skings camos exc, the bad thing about this is that except fo temporary skns or camos that you get every onse and awhile you are stuck with basic guns and basic characters. Overall based on the positives and negatives i give Black Squad a 6.5/10"
11882,"It's garbage. simple. has shooting mechanic of CS:GO with additional useless scope on many weapons that's pratically useless most of the time.

It's not pay2win at all, you may buy some weapons but the weapons that may be earned are absolutely equal in strength. Their additions of killstreaks for 4 different classes add to making the game really fun. You can usually join a game in about 30 seconds to a minute, but you might want to switch to another server region during night hours since player numbers dwindle in late hours. You may also buy some guns and weapons on the game's Market, just like CSGO, as well as random crates."
11886,"bad and boring game, play others such as siege or csgo. If you don't have cash to spend then sure this is fine but otherwise there are just much better games out there."

11889,"A really good game. It's so good, I'd pay for it"
11890,"[b] Black Squad	[/b] is another one of those Free-to-Play shooters available on steam, and we all know there are a lot of those, so why talk about this one ? Well, this one is actually pretty good and does not suffer from any major flaws like many others do.

For starters, it's currently one of the most popular and you will always find a game in the mode you want at pretty much any hour. That's a big part of an online game and this one has been running for a couple years and is in a state that assures several more months, maybe even years. It is still not too late to start playing.
In terms of lag and hit detection, it really is serviceable and apart from a few instances, you won't need to switch server or game to have a lag-free experience.
Few hackers, most are pretty obvious but never stay long and by taking a look at the recent updates, they're doing something to fix this. All in all, definitely not a major concern as it remains, as I said, infrequent.

Another big part of F2P games is the currency and the economy. Once again, Black Squad does well as it is pretty generous. You can obviously have everything right away if you decide to buy it with real money but that will be pretty expensive. However if you decide to take the free-to-play route, with the daily rewards, the daily / weekly / monthly missions and post-game rewards, this all adds up quickly enough and if you also take into account that every other month there are events where the rewards are much bigger and everything is 30 to 50% off in the shop, you end with a model that is affordable for everyone, whether you use your time or your money.
The only thing basically locked behind a paywall are the skins, and well...they're skins so if you really want them, play during the events and you'll get some and free weapons at the same time. Nice !

Speaking of guns, Black Squad packs quite a punch. Shotguns, smgs, assault rifles, sniper rifles, in-betweens, melee weapons... There is a lot to play and experiment with and there is something for everyone. More get added over time, balance patches regularly...It works !

Now I still have a few gripes with the game, the main one being the spaws in deathmatch mode, which is the most popular like in all F2P shooters. Unlike Call of Duty where they're ""dynamic"" or ""not set"", here there is a spawn
point for each team and that's it. As you can probably imagine, that leads to a lot of problems like spawn killing as soon as the teams are not balanced, which is boring for one side and sucks for the other. Some less popular modes don't always have multiple games to join which means that when they're full, well you're out of luck. After playing for some time, the main currency that you get everywhere becomes useless and you're left with 3 millions in the bank without any use.

Those are for the most part minor, and you can adapt your experience and get what you want from the game. It's a shooter, pretty generous, and it works. If you don't like the latest Counter Strike or Call of Duty, but want to shoot guns, turn to this one and you will probably have a good time.

That's a [b] 7	[/b] from me, and as a F2P shooter, I recommend it."
11891,"cool game
"
11892,"Mistook it for another game, then I found out I was playing - 

Microtransaction and Premium Currency: The Game."
11893,how i can switch bullet to bs coins>?
11894,I would rather play Combat Arms
11895,This game is awesome great graphics and simple hud simple system UI and and all map are simple this game is better then csgo
11896,"This game, even though it is free to play, is rather rubbish.
Just as most other FPS games are, this is a 'pay-to-win' game.
To get a new gun, either play for 200,000 hours to get enough in-game money, or pay £10 for a gun. (This may be an exaggeration)
It is an early access game, but I doubt that they will change this.

My rating: 1.5 / 10"
11897,gud gei ez pizzi
11898,i like this game
11899,amazing game honestly the graphics are not the best but their alright but the gameplay is the amazing part the gun play oh yeah
11900,Wow

"
11902,it decent
11903,"Black Squad is a game looking for many features, and becomes too much like other games that it takes away the 'fun' value of the game. Overall I'll list the pros and cons of the game as follows...

Pros...
Game is fast paced, adn if you stay on top of it, you can get some pretty cool skins. This game is also a LOT like cs:go, which isn't nessarly a bad thing, as it gives you more maps a possibly an easier crowd to playu with. It's free, what can you expect lol

Cons...
Where this game seems unique when it comes to ""timed"" skins and gun unlocks, it is also annoying. Constantly buys these unlocks is not always as fun as just jumping into the game. Also, simply being a cs:go clone, it doesn't have the same following or upkeep as its competitor. 

Overall, I'd reccomend this game to play as a sort of cooldown, as the players aren't that hard to combat, and many of the aspects can be fun, but only breifly"
11904,omegalul
11905,yea
11906,love
11907,goodddddđ
11908,"Nice game worst support FULL OF HACKERS and the supports help them by leaving them and give them protection I reported so many of them and they let them play and they will always say =we need a video proof with some 3rd party software=no matter how many times I explaine a video from my point of view will show nothing we need a embaded game replay system that show how those hackers headshot us blindly and show the aim is automatic always on our head

I will give this review a NO"
11909,"This games is bad looking, unbalanced and devoid of any fun or good spawns. TTK is all over the place which results in a game more unbalanced than the buggy hit boxes of Siege."
11910,haters gonna hate liars gonna lie but this games black bhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/550650/Black_Squad/#ut yet so high
11911,u r no good only sassy luigy you dumb mom
11912,Yes. Yes. Yes.
11913,"I am in love with this game. I may have a low playtime, but it is extremely fun. Many say that there are many hackers, but I don’t encounter them often, maybe my low rank ;-) it is not p2w you get pretty good starter weapons and you can get an ak after a bit of playtime. Then the real fun begins. I definitely recommend this game to anyone that just wants to play a FPS without any crazy hard mechanics. Its definitely sootable for a person new to the genre, like I was myself. Only little bummer is that recoil is random but you can most likely deal with it!"
11914,"Amazing game, especially considering it's free to play. Better than most other FPS games that you have to pay for."
11915,Dieses Spiel hat Potenzial und macht mega viel spaß!
11916,"The game is well made, hackers  and glitches are rare. Graphics are ok. Gameplay is ok. There are a lot of customization options for both your character and your gun. No pay to win. Recommend CS:GO now that it's free."

11924,"Mostly good Game,however,there's a big Balancing Issue.
You see,I'm not that good a Player,but I've played this Game for a bit,thus giving me a Relativly high rank.
Sadly,the game sees this as a Permit to pair me with Players way above me in Skill,because the game values Rank above actual K/D(mines horrendous),wich is just not right.
The Crates I buy also always seem to contain just the Oposite of what I want/need,but that's a minor Isseu,Grenades and Skins aren't THAT important.Otherwise,this is a very decent Game,download it."

The game is awesome but needs some bug fixing 'game crashes, sometimes cant shoot the weapon for 3 secs).
Lots of noobs in this game think there are lots of cheaters, but I only fought against 1...

11942,to com aids
11943,"Well the gameplay was ok, though no as responsive as I would hope. The graphics are decent and the characters look ok. The biggest problem I have is with how long it takes to join a game. Even if you are already playing, the round doesn't just end and start a new one. It boots you to sit and watch a counter click by, saying that it's looking for a game. Minutes will tick by. Sometimes you might get lucky and you'll randomly join a game, but mostly it will just count."
11944,"First comment....If you've got a high ping, forget it. Game sucks.

It's nice to have a casual, us vs them style game. If that's what you're after, it's a great hit out."

Seriously,  This game Tries to be middle ground between the two while giving up everything that made both games enjoyable to play...     There is hundreds of better FPS games out there... (some of which run on unity)....  With CS:Go now free to play, along side dozens of CoD clones out there,   its just not worth the time..

Game play was so bad i dont even feel the need to even look at the cash shop of any other aspect of the game... its that bad"

11964,11/10 better FPS game than Playpark Special Force 2. No Kappa.
11965,"I LOVE IT!!!
"
11966,awesome game
11967,It's like a knock-off csgo. It wouldn't be so bad but there is no player base to it and you have to spend money in order to get more weapons to use. I wouldn't recommend it.

Clone/10

Basically a bad looking rip-off of cs:go, which in my opinion isn't even a good game either.

Played 15 minutes in this game and had enough."
11993,"It's a great game, since it's free, but I must say, it's well optimised"
11994,Like CS:GO.
11995,AWSM! Recommended for FPS gamer.
11996,"Pay to win, you can get better weapons from loot boxes  (which unsurprisingly cost real money)"
11997,Unplayable because of fps drops. Such a bad optimization.
11998,"It's a good game with solid mechanics, decent balancing and not really much ptw. It's very much a pay to pimp game. The gun's don't feel very impactful, mainly do to the sounds, recoil, and how enemies react, but that is my biggest gripe with the gun play. It's not an awkward feelings.

Unfortunately, i had to stop playing the game. Since this game is Korean, the majority of the players aren't on NA, and the queue times are very long, if you even get a game. The servers are also hosted from Korea to my knowledge, so playing it in NA is janky at times at best, and game breaking at worst. It will receive updates for a while since it's a big shooter in Korea, but there just isn't enough NA players to play the game with efficiency, if at all."
11999,it's broken
12000,Muy muy bueno enserio :D
12001,very nice
12002,"I don't have a chance to play many PC games, since my internet and pc might as well be a freaking potato. This game, however, allows me to have fun running and gunning as a cute girl with a big gun. Thank you! 10/10 will glady play again."
12003,sucks
12004,too many problems and too many cheaters
12005,another COD another to be hacked another that has been hacked and with that unistalled
12006,An excellent game. I've been playing this game since it launched in S.Korea.
12007,better than counter strike (if you are against my review then you can say it)
12008,pls just give me lvl 100 already so i can complete the achievement list for this game

12020,Overall great game. But they should work on South East Asia server. Should enhance their optimisation.
12021,Hey dude i was checking out your game but i dont really know what this is but what the heck nothing is working!!!

Not for sure how to spectate people in a random game, and no reporting features or support for staff to investigate players. 

Can be a fun game when you are not being instant killed, I would never put any money into this game, the support is trash.

12065,"This review is written from someone who enjoys competitive fps games
positives:
-free
-easy to learn  due to imported features from many games( sliding etc)
-classes with meaningfull abilities
-runs fine on most systems


negatives:
-awful matchmaking
-Cant choose teams in a lobby(call it auto balance)
-dubious and unrewarding ranked system
-No real point besides unlocking weapons to keep playing
-some weapons that are paid with currency feel overtuned in damage and recoil
-Maps are actually made by someone who clearly doesnt know how to build balanced levels,.
-hole game turns into a grenade/ bombardement fiesta
-high influx of cheaters
-destruction gamemode can be exploited with m249 and similars
-some modes are not really played (expect to be waiting for a long time)
-hit reg is not effective
-loot crates in a free to play game coz why not ,cosmetics arent enought
- has a decent mission reward system but because there are 3 types of currency but weapons bought with normal currency feel worse then the ones paid with money ( in terms of mainly damage)
- i am tired of games that make nades overtuned like the explosive one and make the utility ones useless as ****
- updates are literallly skins

all in all it is not the worse game i have ever played but it carrries the same bs all ftp fps are carrying lately , high amount of microtransactions, no real progeression and high amount of cheaters"
12066,Highly recommended!
12067,Black squad is like a Crossfire and it really continues its toward to a better gameplay.
12068,pewpew 2 fast 4u
12069,"This game lacks any kind of identity that separates it from your average f2p COD knockoff, and the gunplay feels functional, but forgettable.  Run around and shoot generic guns at generic soldiermen.

As a huge military shooter fan, this game REALLY disappointed me."
12070,"Game started up with a white screen, froze. Second and third attempts I selected the window compatibility option, got through the intro but froze with a black screen after."
12071,Just needs people playing NA servers
12072,good if you dont have rainbow six siege
12073,"Lost it's place as ""best free FPS-game"" when CS:GO went f2p, but it's still a very good for a game."
12074,I play both black squad and cs go.. but i love BS the most . ..addictive game !!
12075,"This is an amazing free to play fps game and completely not a pay to win one. It's got beautiful graphics thanks to Unreal Engine 3 and run surprisingly not that heavy for medium tier rig by sacrificing the 'high quality' option and choose the medium one. As far as I play it, there are not that many cheaters crawling this game. In fact, you might even be able to spot the BattlEye bans several players out of the match in just one week. It's not perfect, but you don't have to worry about having to meet a cheater as much as perhaps in other fps games.

The realistic aspect is deeply considered in the process of making this game. From the fact that 1 round will be stored in the chamber, giving you the chance of having extra 1 bullet by simply reloading it, to the fact that you can scope (right click) on pretty much almost every gun exists in this game, be there just an iron sight or equipped with a sight and scope for designated marksman rifle. Grenade launcher attached to many assault rifles adds up the tactical experience since you don't really have to be so dependant on your aim and can just try to predict the opponents' next moves and bam.

The skins do not, in any way, affect the performance of any gun presented in the game. However, they do make some of them look much better and beautiful, sometimes even have their own reloading animation. Still won't affect your gameplay in terms of extra advantages.


Update 1:
The game is dying since the past one or two months. The average online players are getting lower and lower. It finally hits 1Kish players. At this point, they decided to merge all the server so the players will have less trouble in finding on-going match despite the fact that they (the players) may forget about ping and suffer a lot from it. Competitive in several regions is completely dead. There's just not enough players to queue even one game. I've sent them several suggestions including the fact that they really need to campaign more on ads. I've never seen them posting any ads on any commonly used platforms. It's sad. Honestly speaking, the game has much potential yet has died even before the EARLY ACCESS tag is put away.

Update 2:
The developer finally decides to remove your ability to sell in game items like your weapon skins. I'm glad I was able to sell mostly everything before I stopped playing the game. I only noticed it when I came back to the game. Now there are even less NA players (less than 50 active players on custom room mode as of right now). This game has only recently declared that it's finally got through the early access, however it's already dying; even before they take out the early access tag. My prediction is that this game is going to be completely dead within several months in NA region."
12076,"Best F2P FPS around.

12080,suck ass
12081,yeah! awesome
12082,"I have played enough of this to say that if you take your fps seriously, this is not the game for you. noobs spamming claymores and grenades everywhere. It is how new players get kills instead of actually learning to aim. When you lag in this game it just prevents you from shooting. nonthing more fustrating than  running up on someone from behind with the crosshairs on their head and not being able to shoot. They turn around and kill you because they have 10 seconds to shoot at someone who cant shoot back. The hit detection is so poorly written it will lag your computer when getting shot or shooting the enemy(throws you aim off). They have "" fatal shots"" that make the same noise and animation of a headshot. so you hear it and think that you killed the guy. BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. still alive because of that stupid mechanic. Now, they started getting annoying with the cosmetics. They have a halo suit blue and red, and glowing hearts. Two things wrong with this, first, it completely removes the theme. Second it makes it hard to distinguish between your team and the other when everyoen is running around in halo suits glowing with pink hearts. They are trying to cash out on particle effects. So you might like this game if you are a casual player, but otherwise don't bother."
12083,Больше ничего нельзя продавать......... ну и зачем после этого игра вообще нужна??
12084,"I like this game. It is like a mix of CoD and Battlefield, at least in my opinion. Everything you need is in game and all weapons are pretty balanced. there is no Pay2Win. Though my major concern is the FPS drop. I have been playijng this for a little bit not and never had an issue, 120 fps at least for the longest time. But, just recently, i am getting 10fps. I do not know the issue or why it switched but i cant seem to fix it. Either way, besides the fps drop and making the game unplayable, this is  a good game."
12085,"A really great arcade shooter. It's super easy for new players to jump into, the graphics are nice, the gameplay is nice, it's satisfying to play and is packed with constant action. I expected I would have to buy some upgrade to enjoy the game properly but nope, it seems you get the full game for free. People can buy skins, which is weird as the default loadout looks best imo... 

Why is it that I spend so much money on games yet enjoy the free ones the most?? 10/10"

12104,"Hi
Why does the game Black Squad give error messages to Iranian players? Error message 0 * 000000
Please consider a lot of players this game Black Squad plz...."
12105,"free to play fast paced arcade game, brings back childhood memories, love it"
12106,Full of hackers ... and guess what .. u have no report button .. so .. ! perfect russian game :)
12107,An awesome free to play FPS for low spec pc also
12108,"Game is kinda like AVA mixed with SF2, But with better melee."
12109,"Very boring game. It's not a P2W though. Just a generic F2P shooter.

Pros
1. Not Pay2Win.
2. Sound design is excellent.

Cons
1. Dull graphics.
2. Terrible UI.
3. Repetitve game play.

I recommend trying Ironsights it's truly a f2p COD. Oh and anyone saying BS is better than CSGO, CSGO is free now."
12110,"shit game
"
12111,Go to the Asia Server and get your ass handed to you by hackers. Crap Game.
12112,still cant go in the game
12113,i like it and delete it pls tonight
12114,"Crashes with explosions.
Crashes with weapon firing effects.
Crashes with enemy spawning in PvE.

Amazing update guys."
12115,WoOoW
12116,pretty cool dog
12117,"When you advances in this game its to much better to play and goodness think to this game,You also can choice the goods team and also badness,but its cool you can play with friends in a clan:)"
12118,this game is a good shooting one but include lots of bugs that make you hate black squad and delete it after you play it
12119,IT S LIKE CSGO AND COD HAVE A FREE BABY 8/10 BUT FOTR ITS PRICE IS 10/10
12120,"First of all, it is possible to play for free. It is more accessible than CSGO and is also good for playing with a light heart. However, the chronic optimization problem hinders interesting play. I set my options low and play games. But. due to lack of optimization, VRAM consumption is very high. I use Haswell i5 & 1060 6gb, but the lag is very serious because of the high VRAM consumption. When the game was being served in Korea, there was no such optimization problem. My aiming isn't very good, but the problem of optimization often results in a head-to-head defeat. Even considering that, it doesn't change that this game is very exciting."

12122,I love this game!!!!!
12123,"good game, it's free, try it

This is for devs; need more metal ingame"
12124,"SUPER AWESOME I LOVE THIS GAME <3 Just some quite bugs that needs to be fixed, but that's all! <3"
12125,"Spend $50 in this game and got nothing, sorry black squad im done.."
12126,"Frequent game-breaking bugs and glitches in an otherwise solid multiplayer game.
Sudden white-screens and persistent mini-freezes one being shot, none of which happened in previous versions of the game.
Winter-themed maps are eye-cancer with bleeding white everywhere."
12127,"Not really good, a bit underwhelming."
12128,"its like CS:GO but the guns shoot in a straight line there some time can be bullets spongeing now and then 

its a very well made game for a F2P and graphics dont looks bad 

there could be more items that dont need (bullets) to get like player characters can only be bought with real money  

there only seems to be no camo guns and refills for the equipment with out real money 

overall the game play is clean and the maps are very well made. i think people only play this because they couldnt get CS:GO but now that it now F2P i think more will move over the that game. but never the less would recommend to some who likes FPS or is new to PC and you dont need a high spec the run thia"
12129,Great start of a game! fun & fast paced. 0 p2w try it out you'll get hooked
12130,"free and fun, if u ignore hackers."
12131,"This game so fun, but please add ""Report cheater"" button."
12132,Not bad
12133,"It's a good game, I used to play it nonstop, but the anticheat system could be improved, and the devs need to listen to the playerbase and fix the game"
12134,"Add Server=Asia because there is too many people froom india and pakistan those play BS and they get 200 ping me also get 300 ping so i have to use VPN 
Add new gun M416
Add new pistol
Add pone 
Add voice chat in all rooms like custom and quick 
Add shooting Ground where we test up coming guns 
and new detail like when we take out our knife we can see animation but not other or when we kill someone we see good animation but other see simple animation plss improve it"
12135,Katastrofa
12136,"good game and great texture for free game!!!
"
12137,not bad
12138,Awesome
12139,"Don’t take this game too serious, have fun, shoot at bastards, and you’ll surely like it."
12140,this game has potential but there is a lack of players and the queue is way too long
12141,not bad
12142,trash. do not download. waste of time.
12143,It's not fortnight or pubg mobile but it's worse *********
12144,Is like anime cs but like freeish
12145,It is the best free-to-play fps there is I dont have that good at all of a computer and it still plays like a beaut.
12146,"I played this game when I saw it in free to play section (of course amma poor guy with no pennies in the pocket). So I started playing this game. Most of the game experience was same as CS : GO. To be honest this game does looks like CS at some points. Also they gotta fix this clan system properly cause its been a year and no clan is accepting my request even I met their requirment. Anyways, I rate this game 8/10.
Things I liked :
-All weapon states are similar no weapons are overpowered
-Events
-Daily attendance rewards
-Nothing to buy with real money cause you will get everything better with in-game money
-Ranking system
-Gameplay
-Normal GUIs like other Asian multiplayer games (not much stylish)
-Gives free BS coins XD
-They even give you free skins

The things I disliked :
-Community
-Servers latencies (not much good ping)
-Battleye anti-cheat system (blocks the main .exe file everytime)
-Duplicate weapons cant be sold more than 1K coins
-Little bit Pay 2 win but ignorable

Suggestions :
-Make your server better please
-Pay attention to hacker (there are less, but will be more)
-Make the skins tradable and marketable (all of them)
-Increase gold reward for weapon selling (in-game)

Dont forget free skins and DLCs XD"
12147,i like this game but it s illogic
12148,yaaa
12149,"good old style fps, if you like fast pace action shooters... you'll like this game.
the bad points... cant test guns before buying, game keeps crashing 00000000X0 error, quick match is not quick so everyone plays custom."
12150,One of the best free to play games.
12151,Just Like CSGO~~!
12152,Overall it's all good but I want a report system.
12153,"There are way too many broken things in this game (Eg: Sentry guns) Other than that, it has potential. But please nerf the Sentry Guns"
12154,"Out of all Free To Play FPS games, Black Squad has delivered this avid experience to me personally and probably many of those in the community. With the ""Tac Reload"" being a simple term used in the community since every now and then you'll have to reload your weapon at the starting sequences of a match. Browsing through the choices before me, particularily the free to play section, Black Squad by far is the best free to play FPS game that I would pick in a heartbeat.

Black Squad has an array of weapons which is quite interesting, along with the skins that the developers never fail to deliever in every patch notes every now and then. From using assault rifles to sniper rifles, it challenges each and every player to try out weapons every now and then. It puts you in this immersive environment where you calculate the risks every now and then, whether it may be a peek, a rush or even a flank. Personally, I love the fact that I can experience and put myself out there with various weapons ranging in different Rate of Fire or Recoil. It's truly a time-consuming but enjoyable experience.

Over the months I have been playing Black Squad, I have seen how the community of Black Squad is. Its been this friendly community in which everyone likes helping one another. Of course its not an FPS game without some toxicity added into the mix, but members of the community of Black Squad are making the effort to promote non-toxicity. The competitive scene of Black Squad may be small, but there are lots of potential and every player is encouraged to join up in weekly tournaments and such and for me personally, it's this grueling, time-consuming, adrenaline-packed experience. For those of you who are looking for an FPS game, where you can communicate with your clanmates or teammates, Black Squad delivers. But you can be that lone wolf that likes carrying the team if that is what you want to be.

Although this maybe the case, personally along with most of those in the community, I feel as if Black Squad will need additional work as in delivering fixes on the mechanics of Black Squad instead of adding new skins and maps in patch notes every now and then. 

But overall, I would really recommend you to try Black Squad out! If you guys would like to add anything into this, just comment as I have enabled it for this review. And in ending words, Tac Reload.

"
12155,Thought it would be P2W it really isnt!
12156,"This game is actually amazingly fun!!! reminds me of the old days with Combat Arms. the gunplay is smooth and alot of interesting guns to choose from without having to pay a dime. 
10 out of 10
way better than CS:gay 

ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED with the BADASS SEAL OF APPROVAL"
12157,ez
12158,get csgo instead
12159,"Why should you download and play this game? 
Here's why:

1) It's F2P.
2) It's NOT P2W.
3) It has a ton of players.
4) Weapons are balanced.
5) It is NOT a grind fest. 
6) Hit boxes are great (better than a lot of AAA games).
7) It plays a lot like COD but it also has more tactical elements like recoil, nade management etc.
8) Maps are decent.
9) There are both casual and competitive matches to choose from. 
10) Few bugs for a F2P game.
11) Decent community.
12) It has a large variety of weapons to choose from."
12160,nice
12161,like it
12162,Tate this game sucks ass
12163,the new king of f2p games
12164,"Extra free to play FPS game, need some improvements but its ok :)"
12165,"ANOTHER PAY TO WIN 
"
12166,almost better than yur mum
12167,thoe the grapicts are like from 2014 it is one of the best games if you are into all out war games.
12168,"☑ Gameplay
☑ Graphic
☑ Multiplayer
Rate : 9/10"
12169,This game won`t even let me start. There is nothing wrong with my pc i`ve checked. It seems cool and i like the idea to have such an awsome game. i am gonna be fair and not give you the lowest since other people can play it nut it is a no for me. 3/10
12170,cherly boobs
12171,Good Game. All the maps are good. No problem playing with it.
12172,"By considering the fact that Black Squad is a Free to play FPS, it's indeed a very good game. The devs do actually care for the opinions of players. 

However, I'll like the game even more if they exclude the demolition maps from TDM. Cause it's really not that fun to play TDM on demolition maps, as those maps are larger."
12173,kinda gud
12174,"I wish this game wish more popular. It's overlooked so easily since it looks like another generic shooter. It's so well optimized and NO P2W while being 100% FREE. Plenty of game modes and plenty of maps. Nice and helpfull Discord community, and the developers acutally talk to us!!! If you like CSGO, CoD, and other similar games then give Black Squad a chance."
12175,very fun
12176,no
12177,does not start 0/10
12178,nice
12179,Fair
12180,"This game is just great! If you are tired of hearing Csgo, call of duty, or fortnite, and you want to try out something new, this game should definitely be considered. Black squad is kind of like a blend of Csgo and call of duty, but in a unique way. Black squad is not a pay to win game, the only micro transactions are for skins and cosmetic items. I give this game a 7/10, it’s an amazing game and finally something different, it’s just the anti-cheat still needs some improving and so does the ranking system."
12181,"This game decined all his rules and market falldown ,they closed all item from market ,so don't wasted ur time on there

there is nothing to spending time go and join a game with stability in rules ..."
12182,"game is amazing
just make sure you can pump 60FPS + with 59 0.1% and you will get an amazing experience killing noobs
go to free FPS game"
12183,this game so gud i love it
12184,Rly good free to play game but maps are not the best
12185,"Better and pace is much faster than CS, my own Humble opinion."
12186,"A wannabe counter strike game.Though it is fun,they could have borrowed the mechanics from cs.Keep up the good work."

Amazing Game."
12188,"Game is utter trash nowadays. Was fun in the beginning but I guess the devs didn't care and threw it away. 
Errors such as randomly dcing and getting an error code 0x0000 still exist (since fucking beta) and are probably not getting fixed in the near future. 

Pathetic matchmaking as well. What do you need ranks for when no brainers are in every tier. There's little chance to get decent teammates with some sort of brain/gamesense. 
solo queue? not enjoyable

d0g5h1t g4m3, -rep"
12189,If only there arent many hacker. It could be a great game
12190,rtyn
12191,good game :D
12192,"The game won't even let me play, gives the ""disconnected from server 0x0000"" error and then closes the game in main menu.

Review remains negative untill the issue is resolved."
12193,the game crashed il pve
12194,I would be glad if this game supported (Os Windows 10 32 bit) Can someone make it happen?
12195,_
12196,"I Absolutely LOVE this game.
I LOVE playing Capture.
I  HATE only have TWO maps for my FAVORITE game mode.
Literally just make 1 or 2 more and i'll be good. That's it.
whole game is great but one of the best modes. 2 maps. WHY?"
12197,return to monke
12198,"used to be fun and nice, now its bullshit, devs did everything to make the game bad and what are doing is rly working.
i have no idea why i would play this anymore its just useless. Can't they listent to the community ? No ? doing the most bad choises possible ? YES they do it perfectly ! i loved the game was a true fan, now i just wait it to die. LOL"
12199,Best Game Ever period
12200,One of few good free to play multiplayer games on steam.
12201,"dont spend a penny on this game , just play free dnt buy any stuff, chests will give you same thing over and over again, in fact i have noticed people who spend no money get bettter drops then those who do"
12202,"Games like this does not really exist anymore, However this is keeping  that nostalgia FPS Shooter that everybody used to know and love. Its not pay to win. Its free to play, Its simple. Aim for the head Win the fight. Its simple mechanics and action packed with fun. I've really been enjoying this game. Reminds me of some old FPS Shooters that used to be around. Keeping this style alive with this one!."
12203,REALLY BAD.
12204,"Good game, has a CS feel to it. The lobbies I have encountered have been a bit toxic though."
12205,"Welp... that was a HUGE let down.  I just spent 47$ worth of bullets (including the special offer) and I literally got nothing more than a new name card out of it.   That's it.  A NAME CARD!!  And an ugly one at that (becasue they are all pretty ugly lol).  I love this game.  I am a daily player and I figured I would spend some money to help support for the devs.  In total, I opened about 70 crates... maybe more?  

70. Freaking. Crates. 

And the only actual weapon I got from 70 crates, was literally the a duplicate of the EXACT weapon I use regularly: the Green camo M4.  

Literally the ONLY weapon I use on a daily basis, is the ONLY weapon that dropped from any of the crates.  Every single crate was either 25 BS (Bullshit) coins or 100 medals or whatever the amount is.  But the exact amount isn't important.  What is important is that it's not enough to buy anything other than the same, boring stock weapons that come in the FREE DLC. Let that sink in...

47$ = FREE DLC weapons.  Smh...

Like I said, I love Black Squad as a game!  It is the only FPS I currently play regularly.  The devs are doing an amazing job on it GAMEPLAY-wise.  But as far as currency / crates / drop rates ... TERRIBLE.  I will remain a dedicated player and still login daily to play.  But as far as spending any more money...HELL NO!.  I'm sitting here feeling like I just got scammed or robbed at gunpoint or something lol  No joke... Spending 47$ worth of bullets to end up with a freaking name card is just plain ridiculous.  It left a very bad taste in my mouth and I will not buy any more bullets in the future.  

And btw, I'm not some wierdo that just types negative reviews over nothing.  This is actually the first review I've written for ANYTHING in YEARS!  I considered not even writing it, because I actually enjoy the game.  But I just had to... I don't want anyone else to waste their money on a damn name card.  So, until they fix their absolutely horrible drop rates... I'm not spending a single penny.  And even then, I doubt I'll want to risk getting burned again.  

Thank God I decided to try it out first and I didn't buy 100$ worth of bullets, like I originally planned to.  Smh..."
12206,"personally I dont enjoy this game, I dont like the mechanics of it, But I do know a lot of people that do enjoy this game."
12207,"Noice game, one of the best shooters i ever played."
12208,GG
12209,good game
12210,The scene is too pro.
12211,Pretty Bad...
12212,Great solid F2p shooter. You can only play at certain times based on player population but I always have a blast when im on.
12213,"Love this game, true free to play, yes you can buy things in the game but they are just skins you get no advantage from buying a weapon"
12214,"I, the left shoe likes this game, while my brother, right shoe thinks highly negative of it."
12215,Meh cheaters everywhere
12216,"Well it is a pretty decent F2P shooter , its not like most F2P shooter pay2win here you dont need to pay money to get good weapons ^^ its only to throw away your money for a game without a good anticheat #BattleEye-Trials-version"
12217,Ripoff from most fps games 4/10
12218,"annoying home screen.
when i open the game I just get a white screen."
12219,no way to exit competitive game
12220,is better from counter strike !!
12221,10/10 no battle royale
12222,its ok
12223,"uhhhhhhmmmmmm it so scuffed to me idk why  
"
12224,Good game!
12225,"very bad game, terrible, piece of trash, DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
12226,"Pretty good game!
Has some bugs and errors atm but I'm pretty sure the devs manage to fix em"
12227,Pop game
12228,"7.8 out of  10
 good but you don't get to feel that FPS feeling like other games"
12229,Fuck you devs idc
12230,"Garbage game that does not fix their optimization. Fps jumps all over the place for all players, servers no reg constantly and shots go through people. They say nothing is wrong but its very wrong. The amount of times these issues happen make the game RNG and unplayable most of the time. UNINSTALLED this garbage. Wannabe COD, csgo. Absolutely not worth your time or effort. There is a reason this game doesn't grow in popularity. An absolute fail attempt that only pushes out content without fixing anything. Fuck off, uninstalled."
12231,"Steam says it has 7,000 concurrent users but in 2 hours I never found a Demolition match. Only game mode with players is Team Deathmatch and the maps are so poorly designed you can literally get to the enemy spawn and camp there as they keep spawning. Menus are abysmal and ugly. Terrible game."
12232,"The game is infested by cheaters - aimbot and wallhack is a must. It has no protection at all (very crippled BattleEye parody).Player base is small - mostly the same people with different accounts. Clans freely distribute cheats internally to dominate the game and be on the board by any means. Usually they will troll you for being bad, noob and so on. This is common BS spread by cheaters in every game.They are trying to keep shady.
The game loot boxes are scam. Do not purchase them as skins have no value or drop in value in a day or two to a few cents.
[u]Only cons:[/u]
1) No kick possibilyty. Many AFK farmers and high pingers with 100-200 ping.
2) Full of aimbots and wallhackers. Cheating in game is tremendous
3) Rebranded Korean badly optimized game from 2014
4) Lootboxes rip-off
5) Very bad team ballance
6) 80% or more players use cheats, macros and so on
7) Hi ranked clans are all FAKE. They share private hacks internally
8) Devs dont give a s**t and will never ban hi level cheater - they do a free advertisment! Devs even give them wallhack as bonus.
9) Delete the game"
12233,Perfect.
12234,"this game i sa fuking joke, you purchase in game bullets to support their game and all we get is bullshit and not the skins that we want its like fucking lottery, so dissapointed"
12235,"Nice game
Good graphics.
But this game is laggy af on my laptop :3"
12236,Kinda like cs:go but with good graphs. Very good and fun game to play
12237,aus servers when?
12238,"Wery free
No money I have"
12239,"Is good game, what else to know?  Caviat is quantity gun, too few gun, yes? Game good all I say today. 
Now please out my home. Yes?"
12240,"This is a top 100 game on Steam yet I still can barely find games. I haven't played since launch but with this Winter Event thought I'd check it out again. It's one of those FPS' that I'd put in the ""Bootleg Shooter"" category. You know the type, we've all played them one time or another. Awful user interface and menus, lacks/terrible voice chat, the store lets you buy guns, but only temporarily. Resembles a bunch of other shooters such as CoD or CSGO. Anyways, if they fixed the matchmaking, this would be a yes for me, but it's a no."
12241,not impressive
12242,TAC RELOAD
12243,"cant even aim properly
"
12244,"Noobish game. Shit , shit and shit. Don`t trash your SSD or HDD (Hard Drive) with this fucking game. Played only 0.3 Hrs and leaved 4evr. Additional , CSGO are free so lets go play CS.
Sorry NS Studio but this is CSGO , Overwatch and TF2 Copy. Sorry NS...
I recommend to install 28 GB TF2 or 16 GB CSGO. Not this trashing SSD/HDD game...
FUCK NS."
12245,best game i have ever played tons of FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12246,Raaaaaaaaaadasdasd
12247,"very nice game 10 on 10
"
12248,Good GAME NEEDS AUSSTRLLIAN SERVERS
12249,"Lovely game, needs oce server. <3"
12250,"THIS FUCKING UPTATE MADE THE LAG AND SCREEN GLICHT MORE. WHAT THE FUCK FIX THAT SHIT MAN. WHEN YOU WANNA LAUNCH THIS GAME THERE IS A LITTLE ICON WHERE IT SAYS ""CLICK ON THIS ICON TO MAKE YOUR SCREEN WINDWOS MODE SO THAT YOU DONT GLICHT"" FUCK YOU IS THAT ALL YOU GUYS FIX. FUCKING SHIT"
12251,Lasagna.
12252,Its ok.
12253,Counter Strike with aim down the sights.
12254,"I'd spend some $ at the store but too infested with hackers in game, no need to waste $ just play free version for the sport."
12255,nice game
12256,fegg chegg
12257,"Pros;
- No P2W, everyone has a fair chance without getting boosts from pumping in money
- Haven't came across one cheater, very easy to get started with people in your skill group and climb the ranks
- Very rewarding, a good shop system with medals and gold you can earn from each game
- Graphics and general gameplay is incredible, the mechanics of it are very easy to learn and get good at
- A whole selection of maps, very surprised by this reading other reviews, there are a good few decent ones

Cons;
- UI could do with a bit of a touch up, the whole interface and graphics doesn't do justice for the actual Graphics In-game, straight away it led me to think it wouldn't have the graphics as I expected. It's also a bit difficult to navigate the menu, I feel once this is simplified you've got it.

Definitely recommend to those that enjoy a well put together FPS game, but also if you're like me and want something new rather than raging at your enemies on CS:GO because the cheaters are unbearable, get this!

12258,dis is a veri god game i never plaied it very god i hop iu engioi!
12259,The best Free game ever?? :D
12260,"just yes, yes"
12261,"very good enjoyed this game played it a year ago, came back to it and suprised how good it is"
12262,"The Best FPS game for me, and I support developers. This game is better than csgo even while early access.."
12263,YAS
12264,I will be playing this from now on because csgo is dead
12265,Nice game
12266,I´d like to recommand this game to anybody that is searching for a fair Free 2 Play Online Shooter. The Maps and Gamemodes are designed properly and new Players get used to the game quite fast. I only miss the design of own Clanicons In-Game and also more Game Modes such as Head Hunting or Capture the Flag for example. As Early Access this game is a full success!
12267,"Its a really good game , could be fixed here and there"
12268,"Dogshit game, horrible fps and fucking horrendous shooting mechanics. Dont download this pile of shit even tho its free."
12269,its ok
12270,gud
12271,love u <3
12272,"F2P CS:GO 
Oh wait"
12273,"When u are done with csgo, this Korean csgo is way to go"
12274,I Can do the yeet
12275,"This is my comment after a 35 update came out.

Battle Eye DOES NOT WORK
There are A LOT OF CHEATERS in this game. If u don't belive just search YT or Twitch.
There is NO REPORTING SYSTEM. Ofc u can ""open a ticket"" and send screens/videos to devs via web browser, but lets be honest. THIS IS RIDICULOUS! And you CAN'T SEE WHO WAS BANNED (if someone was at all...)

There is NO BALANCE in this game
There is NO HIGH PING RESTRICTION (Im still seeing people with 150-200+ ping on competitive channel)
The devs don't care about making this game better. All they want is your MONEY.

So dont waste your time on this game like i did.

BUT if You are interest in collecting/spending money on stupid skins and do not care about ejoyable gameplay at all, then this game is perfect for you."
12276,"a no mas tengo csgo pero este me gusta por los modos de juego :V
"
12277,Deada$$ good game
12278,Cheaters and latency abuser
12279,"awesome 
"
12280,"800+ hours on record, WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO PLAY
Pros-free fps, new skins occasionally, competitive.
Cons-There's no auto-kick feature for laggers, it should be 190ms(THIS IS REALLY THE BIGGEST CON OF THEM ALL, COMPLETELY RUINS THE GAME). No one should be playing with over 180ms, yet there are players running around with 500-800 ms; even people with 200+ ms ruin it, lagging every single match/room, and you can't kill them, because of the REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY POOR hit register.
The maps are lazy, they recently moved all of the demo maps to tdm, because they can't afford to make new maps, and there is zero balance.
The language filter is extremely mediocre, blocks out words like ""another"" or ""typically"" all the while players just add a space to say any actual offensive language.
There are hackers, not very many for a game like this, but they exist, and there is no feasible method of reporting them. Last time I looked you had to record them cheating, upoad it to YT, link it to them, and then hope that they cheating that is undeniable(they probably won't).
They recently introduced a new map and mode(airborne), and it's a bit one-sided
The currency system if very meh, after you buy all guns you pretty much just stack up 'medals', and pretty much have no use for them unless some special event comes about every few months.
Also, this part is probably just me, but in the seasonal PVE mode, I crash every single time the first heli arrives, but only in HM. No problems in ""normal"".

I would recommend only if you are playing on a mediocre laptop that can't handle ""an other""(we have to type another like that in game) fps you'd like to play."
12281,This game is broken.
12282,Game is not working! Black screen upon launch!
12283,is so cool
12284,nice game i like it
12285,"The game is solid, it's fun, quick; like a fast paced counter strike. My biggest issue is that since you get rewarded for attendence, people are using scripts to perform some automated basic movement so that you're left with inactive players on your team in practically every single match."
12286,nice game :))
12287,"good 

"
12288,"why 6k play this beta game just now?

yes its f2p but lol so bad game I try it before very ugly game...

I think people have serious problem!"
12289,Better Game than Cod Definetly
12290,"When entering in the game it shows only white screen. I can hear the music but I cant do anything. I only can turn my pc off and when i am back online the game says error and shuts down.

Still not working. I am having the same white screen problem."
12291,Pretty good game COD+CS:GO but in a good way
12292,Great  shooter!!
12293,eh
12294,Даже мой папа в это поиграл!
12295,I love this Game Very much♥♥
12296,This game has huge potential! My motion sickness from other FPS games isn't triggering when I play Blacksquad which is a huge + for me.
12297,"GOOD GAME !!!!
"
12298,"I love this game Why is the first He is a good game The second he didn't have any abnormal data of guns

The third He asked me to return to the previous FPS fourth world rarely cheaters This is the best I support this great game I love him,
"
12299,Good game with good graphics and great gameplay!
12300,Good game..
12301,"A more arcade style CS. Queue times are way too long tho, wouldn't recommend."
12302,Long ass queue times
12303,"É um excelente game, sendo um dos melhores fps online atualmente. Boa jogabilidade, e não requer uma maquina de alto desempenho."
12304,"""randomized spray patterns belong in an esports fps, it gives me an extra challenge""

~ the average black squad reddit user"
12305,good game but anti cheat is weak
12306,nothing full clann hackers
12307,a cheap version of csgo and cod mixed. but fun to play .
12308,A good lunch break shooter. I hate microtransactions but spent some money here because I do like wht the devs are doing here and wanna support them.
12309,overall good but can be laggy
12310,Great game with best animations and textures. A lil bit expensive market
12311,good game
12312,"AWSOME GAME, RECOMMENDED....."
12313,DONT PLAY THIS GAME IF U DONT WANNA PLAY WITH ALOT OF AIMBOT PLAYERS AND THIS GAME DOESN'T HAVE REPORT SYSTEM FML
12314,It's ok game and still looks wired at that looks like a old graphics
12315,"More like dead squad, not a match to be found."
12316,"Very nice game! 

...and its free :D

***/***"
12317,This is worse then cs nexon.....
12318,best free first person shooter
12319,"This game should change these 3 things - 
1. Ping filtering in online matches - seriously, autokick someone above ping 150-200, they kill you even when you are behind wall, it should be set up in map settings before game
2. Choose different characters from each fraction (for example Elena for viper, Cheryl for other one... ) because some characters are more visible in one fraction than other
3. Please, PLEEEEEEEEEASE - make a filter for custom match !!! It is annoying to sort maps baset on type of gameplay, choose a server on map from a long long list, get in to join just to see message cannot join, the game will end soon... get out and all maps are random again! Really , why is there no filter ?"
12320,good game
12321,What Happen why is my account banned?I was playing at thursday then i opened it now and suddenly banned by administrator showed up?i never did used cheat or whatsoever and man i played 560hrs and youre just going to banned me like nothing?Please solve this problem i really want to play again and yet you banned me

"
12327,HI BS team. MY name is Sahil Shukla. I play BS for since 28th August 2018. I face a big problem today. Today I purchased bullets for purchasing some skins. i purchased 1200 bullets (once per account). I go to random box for purchase gun skins for unlocking beautiful skins. But i found only BS coin and medals not skins. Plzz help me. plzz do ssomething or return my 1200 bullets in my account.
12328,its a perfect game
12329,Good game !
12330,TRASH game
12331,good
12332,Plese add microfone team :(
12333,wanna spend time imrpoving the game rather than releasing 231239239 skins every update ?
12334,"Its one of the best online games i've ever played! Mostly with friend, its very addictive!"
12335,"Better than CS:GO, eh even better than CS:Source.

I had much more fun than either of those games with this.

well worth it.

Good onya devs.

unfortunately the game is dead and the menu is now crappy.
"
12336,"Its an alright game fun to play with friends can be boring all quite a few try hards 
"
12337,I like it but too much asain tryhards
12338,this is a nice game
12339,"its a ok game if you ask me it just like all the free to play game from the past but without microtransactions other than skin 
the only problem with me in this game is those guns that have 45 damage above can 1 shot you in the head (with a very hight recoil) while the other gun have below 45 damage take 2-3 shot in the head (but have recoil that super easy to use even the basic assault rifle can rekt peoples ) number of maps and game mode are fine expect TDM where nades just flying all over the map remind me of STALKER Clear Sky"
12340,bad game
12341,"i think you should put bots... caz players are hard to find

nut am loving a game play ATM"
12342,Nice
12343,"add voice chat
more mods
new weapons
new maps or similar to csgo
 the game is cool but still needs a little more optimization and some maps"
12344,best :D
12345,one of the best fps games ive played :D ( and it has good graphics )
12346,i like this game it cool make good way and some updata
12347,"it was ok but it takes the whole clip to kill someone
like, i only ever got about 7 kills
and they were afk"
12348,"Not sure what has happened but for the past couple of months, NA servers take forever to find a match. I give it 4-5 minutes and then move on to another game that works. Steam charts say there is still a solid player base (4k players on right now) but I canceled my first search after 5 minutes and I'm now at 5 again with no hits. Guess I'll bag this game and move on yet again."
12349,How To be a Partner of BS??
12350,"Black Squad:
- Pay to win.
- Bug I can't select other equipment or weapons i mean F1-F2-F3 is only let me use knife LOL.
+ Well at last not bad graphics but is a serious problem if you cannot select weapons anymore when the bug happen... 
"
12351,This game is amazing.
12352,Best game since Half Life <3
12353,"It's a nice game, though it faces server issues sometimes. I play this game everyday with my friends."
12354,"Had really fun playing this, Is it time well spent well ? probably a BIG NO, all thanks to some various reasons, most of them are due to stupid greedy devs (i dunno if ""stupid"" is enough of many word to describe them) 
here's everything wrong with Black Squad
                                                                                    
                                                                                           -GAMEPLAY- 

-Mobility is absurdly OP, it should be slower when getting shot and while zooming. while rifles are okay, SMG and pistols are different story, if you train enough with them (joke) you can literally compete with rifles due to how little they take from your mobility 
(TL;DR you move as fast as with knife if you are using SMG or pistols)

-Jumpshots are way too precise. You can easily one tap or spray any weapon while jumping.

-On certain maps, balance is terrible. A clear example of this is Dust Shield. you can't A site if you do so it's just straight win for CT

-CROUCH oh god this is just stupid I can't and I will not stop complaining about it. crouching animation is way too fast, which make Crouch peek in this game is way too overpowered. you are about to die but you need to peek just do it. you will have more chances to succeed if you have 100 ping (FYI they took a year to add crouch spam prevention so yeah I don't want to start again)

-Competitive matches are a joke too many things to write so pass

-Run and gun is a truly joke. I’m not saying it should be like Counter-Strike’s, but slightly penalyzing accuracy/recoil when shooting/spraying while moving is not a bad idea.

                                                                                             -UPDATES-

-After two years of almost 50 “patches”, ¾ of these are just moneymaking updates (content updates, not patches). naming this a ""patch"" is just complete STUPIDITY  it's an update where they just added new boxes/skins? 

                                                                                      -BUGS/ANTI CHEATS-

-Grenade indicators (warnings) are still broken. If an enemy grenade lands close to you but on a different latitude,Nothing you die or take enough damage to die to one bullet 

-No report bottom while I didn't meet too many hackers ( about 5 or 6 ) majority of people that I played with and the hole community is complaining about the report bottom for 2 years

-Anti cheat is complete *******. hackers shooting and killing people through walls while staying miles away, I never saw this in any game this is beyond a simple bug or cheat this literally game breaking 

- you are brave enough to report a cheater after going video prof and writing. they will say ""he will not be banned if the anti cheat don't detecting anything, he is just better than you"" still not convinced yet, their anti cheat is so bad to the point where they have to manual ban an known obvious cheater in big tourney only when his aimlock became too obvious.


                                                                                 -MISSIONS/REWARDS-

-copy/past every competitive skin/calling card for each season while only changing the banner or logo (season 1 reward for season 1) / (season 2 reward for season 2)...................

-Better rewards and simplify missions. 100 BS Coin/day by winning 5 Competitive games means you gotta win 5 Competitive games every day during 100 days (almost ⅓ year) to get a 10.000 BS Coin skin

                                                                                        -COMMUNITY-

- Mods muting players at the game Discord server by just giving their opinion, only if the opinion is not what they wanted. this is just sad 

-Worst support ever I feel like I am talking to a bot who copy/past messages"

12382,Complete and utter garbage! People cannot play without cheating and battleeye is about as much use as a condom machine in the vatican! Even worse are the blasted micro-transactions that give people an unfair advantage in the game! if you value your sanity and your computers do NOT install this trainwreck of a game

12412,"Game is really great, it's F2P, you can purchase all weapons just playing the game, and if you want some new skins for weapon then you can purchase it with money. There is all the time some rewards, so most of the weapons you can get without purchase to play for 3 or for 7 days it depends. Anyway I really like the game it's very similar to CS:GO so if you want to play something little bit different this is a great substitute."

weapons costomizations are very nice, in this game u get the wide varity of games modes and weapons like smgs,lmgs assault rifles, pistols, shotguns, knifes  etc.
i think this is a mixture of call of duty and cs.go and i think it could be new csgo in future.
one think i cant like in this game is that some skinned weapons are soo costly, please developers decrease the price of some weapons like ak zorkav and skinned ak-47, except this every thing is very awesome in this game.
i recommended this game to my friends becase this game is new csgo in near future

"
12468,Realy well put together f2p shooter! Probably the best one we got this year so far :D
12469,"Very solid free-to-play FPS, good mechanics, no bullshit. Probably the best option on the market for people who just want to play some games without spending a dime, provided that you don't care for the outdated visuals."
12470,It's awesome game! Plus more maps on DestructionsBattles.. please..
12471,nice
12472,"Deleted game after update, so much cheater. Game is dead now, don't want play anymore"
12473,Just a fun in the sun game!
12474,It big fart
12475,"Devs either had no interest in properly designing maps, or they just have no clue what they are doing. They added Demolition maps to TDM, but the maps were not actually designed for TDM. This leads to a huge imbalance (in TDM, Demo is different) on map advantage for the defending side. Most of the time they can just camp just outside the attacking side spawn with decent covers.
In a little depth of map analysis (keep in mind this is about TDM), the map design for demolition was made so that defender's side is closer to bomb sites, and the sites are more complex, so there'd be more covers and turns, etc.. On the attacker's side, the maps were designed so that initially when the rounds begin, attackers would have to walk some time to get to the bomb sites. As a result, they aren't given much thought or design, and are mostly straight for a long path.
Having the majority of players not having very good aim, this makes it almost impossible for the attacking side team to go very far from spawn. Most of the time the defending side just hides behind covers, smokes off the entrances, and throw grenades/shoot launchers through the smoke. This makes the attacking side impossible to go out of their spawn, or even near the entrance without dying. This cycle repeats until 150 points are reached for the defender side, then the game ends. Even if you hold off and snipe from spawn, there are always teammates that rush out and die (then repeat 20 times) in your match. There is no counterplay to this."
12476,"honestly this is the number one worst game ive ever played, and i used to play minecraft ripoffs"
12477,Good F2P FPS.
12478,this is the best game! just need more attention :)
12479,Stupid matchmaking
12480,This game good but the problem its already infested by cheaters/Hackers.
12481,"Game has greatly improve over time and there is a lot of guns you can choose from.
Some grinding is needed but not too much.

Good job dev team!"
12482,review for badge XD
12483,"PROS:
- No P2W at all
- Quite active community
- Pretty decent NETCODE and Hitbox
- Total absence of cheaters (Suck this, CS:GO!)
- A very interesting ranking and clan system.

CONS:
- Footsteps sound is terrible and confusing
- The uniforms model (without skin) has no latent differences and causes a bit of mess in matches with a lot of players."
12484,"Could be better

Make grenade launchers deal 30 damage, so that they are not a spam tool, but a somewhat interesting decision to go for.
Lower round times and defuse times.

^ with that, the game would be pretty neat but it's already not bad."
12485,"I think Black Squad has better weapon mechanics than CSGO, and they both are the same engine."
12486,good game
12487,One of the best f2p game. No pay to win system and do enjoy the clan matchmaking.
12488,"Ok so black squad can you please make an australian server plz all those people out there that are australian want a  australian server's i think everyone would agree on that, and make the game uncheatable so no one can hack and cheat in it its a good game but just please make an australian server and less hackers etc."
12489,very nice game for me <3
12490,"Hmm, its free and you can earn sellable skins so why not !"
12491,I like this game
12492,the best free game on the market right now
12493,is ok
12494,"i love it
"
12495,Good game but is so sad the way that finished. Beautiful skins and nice gameplay :'(
12496,"Nice game, still needs improvement."
12497,very nice
12498,can anyone tell the admin of this game to fix the rankmatch ??
12499,"Dear  Black Squad creators.

Can you please make a server for South Africans.
This is my favorite game of all time but my ping is always 
too high when i play it.

Yours sincerely SnapTrix"
12500,"# TL;DR -> Down below
After 124 hours of gametime I thought I'll give my opinion on this game. I saw a few other reviews about how the game is ""garbage"" because it has loot boxes and has a lot of hackers. Let me just say this.: You get lootboxes for free, you get keys for free every month. If there's an event going on, you basically get a key everyday. I can't mention any other game that works like this and it's even free. About the ""hackers""... This game is easy to learn but hard to master, which brings this game to the point where you can be matched with skilled players even though you just started 2hours ago and don't even know how to run faster. Talking about the quick matches,  the game does have a decent matchmaking system though. Not every match is balanced, but I don't know any game that has a perfect balance system. Competitive matches are weird, coming from CS:GO I was pretty surprised that a lot of people get ""Eagle"" as their first rank... ofc depending on how you play, but it is the most common rank I would say. This rank has a lot of newbie players thus making it harder to rank up ( look at it like CS:GO Silver ranks ). Overall the gameplay is fluid. The game does have a few weird things like the reloading is weird at first ( you can shoot at 0 bullet, since the last bullet is already in the chamber and not in the mag ) I can't really say any negative about anything in this game. It's free, you can get easy skins which you can sell on the steam market. Try it. Play it. You won't regret it.

TL;DR.
# Pros:
- CS:GO's and COD's secret son 
- Fluent gameplay
- Customizable UI ( crosshair, 4:3 stretched, FOV, weapon FOV )
- Skins ( with Steam Market support )
- Free keys to open boxes
- Events ( Halloween, Christmas, ... etc )
- Daily ""Missions""
- Never met a hacker.
- Devs are on point.

#Cons:
- Weird ranking in competitive. ( Not a big problem )
- Reloading ... When the mag is already inside the weapon it doesn't mean it is reloaded ( ofc when you don't have to cock the gun ) It is a bit delayed. You gotta get used to it.


I switched from CS:GO ( ~1900 hours ) to this. And I'm happy I did.
Thank you NS Studio, very cool!
EDIT: Now the game has Voice chat, my life is complete."
12501,The best free FPS!
12502,Best F2p FPS game!
12503,Cool game! No drop FPS. So much fun game!
12504,Fun free csgo alternative.
12505,God Of FPS Games
12506,Doesn't even start. It is trying to block other program and succumb to it. The game doesn't even start to write a review.
12507,best FPS game i have ever played.
12508,"Early review: Easy to play...but not easy to be pro.
and Now: Too many hackers, Competitive matching is stupid AI when matches 1 solo man eagle  vs 5 mans cobra in squad. DEAD GAME FOR SURE. ...However it's free."
12509,sick game and no p2w
12510,sAd Game
12511,It's a very fun game when playing with friends
12512,Just a good game
12513,yeah the best game with  friends
12514,AWESOME GAME FOR A F2P
12515,AAA
12516,"The staff on this game are corrupted, There were multiple reports on people by cheaters themselves saying that legit players were 'cheating', this is absurd because the player that got banned never ever cheated on this game... The action that this game needs is to be taken off of steam, i get it this ticket will probably never be heard but please, PLEASE take this game off of your platform it's a cancer that needs to be cut from the core. The staff have been banning legit for a long time which is crazy... I've never seen staff do any sort of thing like this on a game please, upvote this so the people can see and PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME."
12517,♥♥♥♥♥
12518,"A good alternative to CSGO which just focus on the gameplay. It reminds me of SoldierFront where you can choose what weapon you want to buy and it will be yours permamently. The ranking system and competitve match is a good motivation factor and each match is within 15mins. 

Badpoints would be matchmaking where it will sometimes be uneven in terms of ranking. No voice communication too so will be hard to strategize."
12519,the new csgo
12520,One of the best free FPS I have ever played! And they keeping adding new things!
12521,noice!
12522,Great
12523,"Hi, i love this game but. I have one question ? Tell me something  about that balanced game ? I am eagel 1 , and i playing versus cobra  1 ? What is it ? Is that normally ? Please repair that balanced and i will be happy."
12524,Beautiful free game!!
12525,10/10 would spend money
12526,too in csgo cheater nabashi bet migan noob

12533,Please remove the aimbot wallhack and no recoil cheat please you're a disgrace in steam's game i thought thag steam games doesn't have cheat and boom there is it please remove it for better gaming experience pleaseeee
12534,good bame
12535,Good change of pace game to get into those meat grinder levels.  Love the guns and the sound work in this one.  Nice FTP game for sure.
12536,Great game. Best to play with friends. Some broken physics but you can use them to your advantage. :)
12537,Best game!
12538,"It IS Free to Play so that is probably the best part of the game...

Pros:
1: Nice and fast pace - If you like the Quake and UT style of play with instant respawns..this one might be for you.
2: Compacted maps - You are in the action within a few seconds. If you are a camper-style player or plan to sit back with a scope and snipe...might want to looks elsewhere. This game is an in-your-face style of play...and you won't have that snipe spot for long before it is overrun.
 
Cons:
1: Graphics from 1995...
2: Terrible balance for weapons - Shotguns at point blank can kill but not in one shot.. Yet a sub machinegun can kill faster.. This is just one of many examples.
3: Sometimes very long load times
4: No tier levels of play - You will be thrown to the wolves and your vets on team will complain about how they are doing all the work and how new players are the worst lol.
5: No lasting appeal... Luckily the game takes very little space on the shelf you will be putting it on soon."
12539,Perfect if you want to start off playing people who are leagues above you in skill. Virtual Cancer. Nobody speaks english on NA server. Pingers. BOT match recommended if you dont want to slit your wrists.
12540,"This is like a CS:GO game but a free version! As a CS:GO player, i enjoy it alot but despite not having the uniqueness of CS:GO, in having many arsenals (primaries, secondaries, melees, grenades), this game is literally your goto game if you are still saving up for CS:GO or you can really try it without hassle since it's free. The game is really enjoyable to play, although sometimes people are a bit toxic and cancerous, it's way more fun to type and chat in the game that having mic enabled like CS:GO. This is one of my favorite games that I am currently playing which is also very fun with friends."
12541,good
12542,"I got a cool knife less than an hour in the game. Pretty epic. Oh, and the game is like CoD and CS:GO sorta. Fun once in a while."
12543,good
12544,NICE FPS GAME
12545,daebak
12546,Awesome first person shooter game. Noice skins 10/10 would recommend
12547,nice game !!!!
12548,best game <3
12549,"It's a pretty mediocre First Person Shooter, I'd say it's worth a try."
12550,"Best game ever in steam..... Best fps game of all time.... 
Rich graphic, amazing modes, nice view and many
Recommend to all"
12551,"Dead game, cheater everywhere, 100% head shot guys slaughter people, many bugs in there and game Dev never care, just changing colors to make ""NEW"" skin and look all player as fool
If u see this,dont play this game, at least dont pay anything on this game, there are many good game waiting for u, DO NOT WASTE UR TIME ON THIS DYING TRASH."
12552,great game
12553,"hey, thats pretty good"
12554,Lagging a lot. Often there are no players to play with. They added non-TDM maps to TDM match rotation and this is sucks. Had to quit the match due to a non-TDM map for the TMD match. That's how it gets bad.
12555,"This game is for those whom cannot afford CS:GO...and would rather it have aiming. The gameplay is fast (depending on how you play). It feels smooth and customization of settings and gameplay just make it a whole lot better. Now, there is no story or great open lands to explore, but it is very fun to play and can get very competitive. Team work and how you play define the game, you can't be lazy and just sit back and let your team take all the hits and deliver them, you have to work with them in a way and play each game as if it were your last. Unless you wanna play bots or TDM with noobs in quick matches.



TL;DR: It's an awesome game to play and it's free ;)"
12556,"Faster paced than CoD, really like how they balanced weapons"
12557,TO JOIN A GAME IS IMPOSSILBE THEREFORE THIS GAME SUCKS
12558,god pussy game
12559,So good
12560,GOOD GAME
12561,"a good fps game with excellent servers but unfortunately
 still low players base."
12562,"I don`t like First Person Shooters like this where you go like crazy trying to kill more people than everybody, but I play with my friends, who like those types of games and I have lots of fun with them. The game is pretty good. I'm always very surprised by the quality of a free to play game like this. Sometimes I think we encounter some cheaters, but nothing that takes away our fun. I totally recomend this game. It's free and it's fun."
12563,I love this game!
12564,noice
12565,awsome game
12566,the best game
12567,Good Game

12571,"Instructions unclear.
Got my guns stuck in my anus."
12572,Great game i love everything about this game playable on low end pc like me.
12573,"Really beautiful maps, good gameplay, a lot of fun unlocking skins during events."
12574,i like this game
12575,"This game is good, but lacks the care from devs, who use all their time on repetetive events and skins. The playerbase would not suffer if they actually tried to improve the game, instead of being only focused on making as much money as possible, until the game eventually dies away. The same thing happend on a game called ""Tiger Knight"" I used play a lot, playerbase went from around 9000 to 0 in half a year. This happened due to microtransactions and skins being the priority and not fixing bugs and balance in-game. Its sad to see the same mistakes being done with Black squad."
12576,^^
12577,FARM GAME IN 2018
12578,"Hi I made a lot profit playing This Game

12588,nice
12589,XD noice
12590,"Pretty great game, has become better since it first came out for sure. Great community and tons of fun to see fellow players, only downside is the server lag every now and then but it is usually not too bad. Overall, get the game! It’s free what can you lose"
12591,best game ever
12592,"Please if any developers see this comment. Pay attention and do something about those frost trails and new added heart tral. When you get those braindead people in competetive matchmaking that gives away their position and loses any advantage of wining 
the game it triggers so much that you almost quit this beautiful game. Hopefully someone sees this and put some work to fix it. Maybe remove it from competetive or something. Thank you for your time.

Edit: No one gave a F#"
12593,"good fps with less hackers than the others but need to fix some bugs
hope that Volofe does a good job to save the game"
12594,Really fun and addictive. Best with friends
12595,"Good game but the devs aren't listening to the community.
Everyone wants a VC since the beginning and better optimalization but nothing GOOD has been added since release.
Toxic community, way to much tryhard, hackers and still the same as release to be fair."
12596,"ït may be old, but i love it! the develepors keep updating for bugs and other things. the best part is that it is free! ou have to at least try it! ps, it get even better with a friend!"

12622,great game but you guys should add player report button
12623,best fps
12624,"For a free game it is not bad at all, like CSGO with none of the B$. Wait times in a lobby can be long which is the only big flaw.

As of right now it is near impossible for anyone in the United States to do competitive match making..."
12625,Alright for a free game
12626,yikes
12627,Good game
12628,Good Game with better graphics
12629,wow nice game: :)

12639,GG EZ ;3
12640,really good with friends
12641,good
12642,"This is actually a fun game, with decent graphics and nice gameplay, despite being free to play. But unfotunately there are some flaws that really hurt the game. Like no penalties for dodging competetive lobbies, broken matchmaking (that sometimes places players with highest rank with unrankeds), and laughable penalties for griefers. 

Other than that the game is enjoyable, and delivers good fun for free. Would definitely recommend, especially if you are from EU, since the NA community is dead."
12643,"Quite possibly the best free-to-play FPS game i've ever played.
+ No pay-to-win
+ Daily log-in rewards
+ Updates every two weeks
+ All gun purchases are permanent
+ A good variety of game modes

-  If you live in North America, the game has a low player base
-  The game has a lot of latency issues
-  Bullets are in-game currency (purchased with real money)
-  The drop rate for winning in-game weapon skins are very low
 
 If you are looking for a good free-to-play competitive game, Black Squad is probably the best choice 
"
12644,jogo top recomendo
12645,Nice shooter game. Thank you :)
12646,This game is gut
12647,Best free to play FPS on the market atm...
12648,<3
12649,Love it.
12650,if this game gone be rated from 1 to 10 stars  i give 10 stars.
12651,"For a free game. I've gotten more than I ever thought. This is an amazing game if you want to play alone or with friends. The only down point I see with this game is that the devs are lazy, they keep adding more loot boxes and less incentives to play the actual game.

Honest advice: Don't go after those 80 Bullets keys, it's not worth it. Especially never buy bullets with actual currency unless it's on sale for 1$ or 3.99$."
12652,10/10
12653,good game but need new items .

I nominated this"
12659,ehmm not bad

12663,Im writing this because i need the xp for the mission omegalul
12664,Pretty good option to go for after playing many different FPS in the world. It gives the best feeling for getting headshots I'm gonna give that for sure and the game pace is obviously fast too for gamers like me that prefer killing and chilling in fast paced games rather than CS:GO competitives. It's not a P2W game for sure to make it fair for everyone to have a chance to become something. They also offer weekly tournaments to win in-game stuff to buy super cool skins. I would definately suggest this game to anyone looking for a different genre of FPS. :D
12665,ez ez farm
12666,"Since Valofe started managing the game they closed the steam market, they stopped gifting permanent rewards and they only want players who spend money on their lootboxes with undisclosed winning percentages, boxes where you hardly get anything.

They don't have GMs, they started manually banning a lot of players without properly checking (do they even play the game to know who is actually cheating? I think they don't... I think they can't even judge reports properly since they don't have experience in the game), a friend of mine got unfairly banned. Believe me, I'm against cheating.
Competitive rewards were permanent items before, now they are 90 days crap although they claim in the future you will get points according to your rank to spend on a new shop. What a mess!

There are no clan wars because no one creates rooms and they do nothing to encourage players to play that mode. The players are decreasing every month, check steam charts.

At this point the game is dying and Valofe is just trying to milk money. They didn't buy the game to invest on it, they seem to not have a plan at all, they just disrespect the player base by banning randomly and taking all the free permanent things you could win in the past by just playing some hours or reaching some rank so you are obliged to buy.

Me and my clan left the game. If you don't play this game yet, don't start playing it."
12667,"PAY 2 WIN
THATS ONLY MATTERS"

12680,"Just love for this game <3
Free to play CS:GO though now its better than CS:GO.
1,564 hours on record ; still love this game.
Most people think that Free Games are shit,but Black Squad is on High man!!

Developer should gift us a big patch & after that patch it should be a paid game.It can attract people .Otherwise,A huge amount of people will ignore BS.
Thats All!!!!"

12684,i really recomend this game really fun fps game
12685,"This is a game where you play for a bit, you get bored of it, you uninstall it, but later on when you browse the F2P again, you realize you want to download the game again. At least that is how I felt.

Hacks are presented in this game, but you also see hacks in Battlefield series, CoD series, CS series, Battle Royale games such as H1Z1 and PUBG, and they are all PAID games. It's very hard for a shooter game to not have hacks, not too say this is more of real F2P shooter game.

The modes are fun to its extent, I can play destruction forever without getting bored, and since everything can be unlocked and bought as long as you save, I don't see any reason of why I don't want to recommend this game. Even some real cash unlocked weapons suck, so I couldn't view it as a P2W game either... Of course, unless it wants to take the route of CrossFire and Counter Strike Online, then it will be a different story."
12686,Bad Game : Too much cheaters
12687,great game
12688,Awesome gameplay with incredible graphics...!!
12689,please add some shooting ground. where we can test the gun first before we make a purchase and for us to decide which gun suits us the best.
12690,is a good game... for my
12691,sooo cartoonish ♥️
12692,good game
12693,"Fun, fast paced. This is not a game you would want to play for a whole day as you will get sick of it but everything else is well detailed. Getting a headshot is very satisfiying. Another con would be that droprates on crates are low so i do not reccommend buying bullets to open crates."
12694,"Great Game love it
"
12695,"i call this game: borrowing features from other fps: the game

combat arms' general microtransaction system, rank system,
call of duty's fast pace, aiming down sights
cs:go's skins, and mechanics like armor,  shift to walk avoiding sound, and dependence on headshots

and its either played by bots or disabled people, since im 1st almost every game

you dont just mash together mechanics, features and make a game.
thats not how u do it
that said i gave it a try, but it was just too bland to continue playing, it felt like it was going nowhere.

it doesnt have combat arms' huge content, game modes, weapons, that made combat arms ranks worth grinding,
it does actually have call of duty's fast pace, however isnt nearly as fun as call of duty, to keep me playing
even though it shares some of same game mechanics as csgo, the mechanics are not nearly as strict as csgo ones, and the games just trying to be both csgo and callofduty at once, which makes me not care about the competetive aspect of this game,

in game's description ""welcome to the best f2p shooter on the market"" alright, that might not be that far from truth, however you know what else might not be far from truth? ""welcome to the most bland f2p shooter on the market""


its not bad for a f2p game but its just too boring and bland to continue playing for like 5+ hours"
12696,Played against the bots. Fun game. Good maps.
12697,Can you make a Oceania server for us Australian’s please
12698,GGg
12699,Nice game so far. Recommended for everyone who likes FPS.
12700,"needs voice chat


UPDATE: hasn't even been a month since this review.The developers have added voice chat.
               Glad to see them working hard for this game. :D"
12701,"Good Game, Noobs!"
12702,"oki im done with this game . first open box give u nothing watch in youtube . then unlucky open free box give u nothing , and toxic players , and ping like sht sometimes , skins market is dead , lose time for nothing , only 1000 player in game u need to wait 12 min to find game , dont lose your time in this game go to my profile and see check my videos i play 900 hrs in this game i lose money and nothing in boxes scam sht company , 7 cheater in game top 100 cheaters , no report no overwatch , anyway good luck and u will not have fun in game ahaha"
12703,This game is fun to play if you cant buy fps games like cod or battlefield
12704,"I only played a few matches in the game, And here's the basics:
It's very arcade.
Maps are not big
Teammates don't really talk, and if they do its usually kids swearing at others
Skins system gives you skins but alot of them only last 7 or less/more days before you lose them, permanent skins are harder to get.
Overall not a bad ""Quick join, get some kills, match ends"" game that's not really sophisticated"
12705,Addictive but gets borred after 4-5hours
12706,you will enjoy those headshot satisfying kills but beside that cancer map design and MM system
12707,Like This Game
12708,it is very nice if you play this you wont go to hell
12709,This game is very wel made and has a really good concept of Visuals/Weapons/In-Game Themes
12710,"it took me 3 minutes to find the cheats, it's not acceptable. I'm upset."
12711,nice game
12712,"its ok
"
12713,amazing free to play game
12714,guys i need help .. if i were to make a new steam account ? will be able to play the same BlackSquad accounts on my new steam account?
12715,"You should consider on stabilizing the servers, and making a server for South Africa"
12716,Dang This game <3
12717,trash game
12718,very fun and good
12719,i use to love this game and it worked great on my pc but now the screen just goes white and i cannot play anymore and that was just after i spent money on the game two :(
12720,"time to kill: if you have all the starting wepons try killing someone enjoy. >:)
hardware: im runing this  on a fucing labtop.
the end"
12721,:3 I LOVE THIS GAME
12722,Cool Game I Really Like IT
12723,"This krap game's a waste of time, even for a free to play. Constantly crashes, buggier than an ant hill, several epochs to load any matches. Played 1 full game ever I think. Tutorial probably loaded more than any real games. Why use hard drive space for this? A tin can would be a better storage method."
12724,Great game!
12725,"One of the best FPS on the market. The only problem I fount that you are not able to try the weapon before buying. So, imagine, you are farming for weeks and you buy a weapon and its russian roulette, because you never know if you will like it or not. Basicly it's the only complain I have."
12726,"My first impression to this game, is actually pretty good.
The graffics aren't optimal, and the weapons could be improved too.
However, this game totally is free to play, thus playable by everyone.
I couldn't start arguing, about the things that could be improved.

Recommended."
12727,"T A C    R E L O A D   Squad

in b4 I look like I'm targetting R6, I'm not. I love R6 but sometimes when I don't get the feeling of playing it this game just is just perfect or may even be better at times.

Summary: COD: BO2, Warface, AVA (Alliance of Valiant Arms), R6:S walked into a bar, got drunk, and had a gangbang where AVA died in the middle of it ([strike]#ripava2015-2018[/strike]) and after 9 months one of them gave birth to a talented, gifted, genius baby called Black Squad.

-Definitely not P2W (more like pay to get hot chicks as character and skins, etc)
-Decent servers ([b]MAY[/b] be better than rainbow six siege servers)
-Good hitboxes [strike]unlike this game called rainbow six: siege[/strike]
-Not the worst community and actually not so bad but there's always toxicity in every MMOFPS, especially when it's free
-SEA server is pretty alive 
-All the game modes are pretty fun and unique, feels like this game combines aspects and gamemodes from different FPS games I love, and there are a decent amount of them
-Events and daily missions give you a decent amount of the different in-game currencies (gold and medals)
-[spoiler]T A C   R E L O A D[/spoiler] Ok ok I'll stop
-Probably the best F2P MMOFPS I've ever played, even the guns you get in the beginning and even the knife you get for free are really good (in my hands) and I can constantly top-frag with just them. [spoiler]although the free semi-auto is a piece of sh*t compared to bolt-actions or the dragunov and the   S T A N D A R D    K A T A N A   has a range that feels like 2x your knife[/spoiler]

Neutral:
-Maps are well, i really dk what to say but I guess they're ok since they're pretty easy to learn
-[spoiler]T A C    R E L O A D[/spoiler] I lied previously

Cons:
-You need to buy grenades (well u can't cook the grenades so it isn't much of an issue for me as a professional grenade master chef)
-This annoying in-game currency called ""BS coins"" (yes they are really BS too) which you can only get from opening random boxes
-Some shotguns are feel like they're worse than others imo (but still if u can use it well then it's still good)
-[strike]You have to pay real cash or open a million random boxes or so to play as a hot chick[/strike]
-[spoiler]T A C    R E L O A D[/spoiler] I'm sorry it's just a really catchy phrase
-[strike]You're not playing it[/strike]

If u can't afford paid MMOFPS games, just play this. You don't need to spend a single cent on in-game purchases and still dominate matches [spoiler]like me[/spoiler] and yet it gives you as much fun as paid FPS games or even more fun depending on urself."
12728,"Pay to win and shit netcode 

Cool art style though(excluding anime girls and digusting weapon skins)"
12729,10/10
12730,Good F2P FPS
12731,This game is a really fun multi action game reall great for fps gives a wide varirty of weapons to chose from really fun to plat and it's free to making it even awesomer i really love this and definitly reccomend this to other fpsers out there
12732,"pros:
- netcode. if you hit a shot on your end theres a 99% chance you hit on the server (in my experience). can't say the same for many other games
- the game is very smooth as it runs on a dated engine
- esl tournaments with prize pools (for a rather unproven game)

cons:
- large and confusing weapon pool
- illogically designed maps 
- fun modes on large bomb scenario maps (it makes for long, boring and a lot of the time one sided matches)
- nade spam (in TDM modes this times two)
- no voice chat in competitive matchmaking (seriously what the fuck)
- you can dodge matchmaking games without getting penalized

as you can see for me personally the cons outweigh the pros, but I still think its recommendable. all the negatives that I listed can be improved or outright removed. this game is still in early access and gets updates every other day, so there definitely is some hope."
12733,"Your typical trash f2p shooter.
Wont even waste both of our time by going into detail.
If you have ever seen any free to play crossfire-like game you know exactly what this is.

There are better f2p shooters out there.
Keep searching brother."
12734,"A little bit pay-to-win (it's not super bad, but it's noticeable), claymores are a bad idea and should be removed- t's the same issue with bouncing betties if anyone played COD way back in the day: just a no-skill auto-death that annoys the player. Turrets (that look more like camera tri-pods) have too much health, probably shouldn't take the combined fire of five people to take out."
12735,Very optimised game!
12736,why does this game feel a lot like something from Garena?...
12737,BLAck squad is the best FREE FPS GAME .

12754,No ballance system in this game.I hate it.

12766,^_^
12767,"The game is fun and for a free game its good. Wouldn't recommend the game though, as it is plagued by hackers and there is no way to report them. 

There is a decent anti-cheat in place but hackers can't be kept under control just through that, then again it is a bit much to expect active anti-cheat from a free game."
12768,"Nice Game 
-Not P2W
-Nice Killfeet
-i dont like the jump so much 
-easy to get weapon
-there are ragekiddis but i ignore them
-nice graffic
-....."
12769,..
12770,hate this competitive matchmaking
12771,Really cool!!
12772,"So basically, Black Sqaud is a mini CSGO that really ties in the feel of older shooting games. I really love the fast and streaming action in this game. It plays well, and keeps you entertained with its gamemodes and inventory system. I just wanted to write this review to give it a thumbs up, and to pursue my new joy in making consise game reviews. Oh, you'll be surprised at the loadout customization in this game; very neat."
12773,"Game is good fun. But lobbies are mostly empty. It has happened more than once that I've played at different times of day at different servers but have encountered the same players.

Another major issue is the random crashing. I was playing one of my best games ever when the freaking game crashed and took all my points and xp with it. Since this game is early access, I'll let this pass. However, please fix these issues. Otherwise the game is amazing!"
12774,Dope
12775,"It reminds me very much of my Combat Arms days just minus the extream hacking. There's still hacking but there just aren't any spin bot, aimbot, Jesus touching, scrotum tugging hacks like there were in Combat Arms. It would be better if the net-code wasn't so shit, but free is free so if you absolutely can not spend $15 on CS:GO then this is probably your best bet."
12776,"This is a game that feels like Counter Strike meets Call Of Duty.

the bullet *omph* of CS but the look and match-making of COD.

Quite fun, although getting guns can be a pain (and many are just straight up needed to win)

A fun game to play for free when you are bored :)"
12777,i like
12778,"Black Squad is an alright game with serious issues, like unbalanced weaponry, non-sensical ui- and menu design and somewhat generic map design. But even with all of its issues it's still a really fun casual fps to spend time with, and for a free game, it has a lot of value. I guess."
12779,No
12780,Cool
12781,Very good simple game. Even better then CS GO for just killing some time.
12782,"DAMN....  i wasnt thinking id like this game. but i tried it out... and i love it, great job on it devs"
12783,Can i sell those guns that I buy via BS coin? I wanted to quit bs. Too busy on family. :)
12784,"Black Squad is excellent. Super slimmed-down fast-paced FPS. Handful of classic game modes, no heath regen, loads of weapons that can be unlocked with currency that cannot be purchased (plus a buyable currency that can be used to purchase cosmetic items), quick callouts, solid graphics, and excellent sound FX. 

One of the coolest features is that you can use F to equip a silencer to almost any weapon and T to turn on a laser that is only visible to teammates. And most of the ARs come with a mounted grenade launcher. You can also hold Shift to walk (silencing your footsteps) or Ctrl to crouch-walk (silencing your footsteps and reducing recoil). And the special cosmetic handguns and knives all have cool draw animations.

For some reason, you start every round with one bullet fewer than the standard mag capacity (29 instead of 30), so the beginning of every round is everyone yelling ""TAC RELOAD"" and reloading to get one more bullet. It's basically a meme now.

I really wish you could test the guns at a range before buying them, since there are dozens of them and a lot of them are only slightly different, but you can just download the four free DLC packs that give you a bunch of guns for a trial period. I highly recommend the SCAR-GL for newer players, since it has decent damage but very low recoil. The G36 and ACR-GL are also good. 

My only real complaint is that the AKs are headshot machines that instantly kill you from the hip at 700 yards with the first shot but whatever. Yes, it has paid keys and loot boxes, but it's a free-to-play game and they're only cosmetic camos for guns/knives you can earn anyway (or buy on the Steam Market for $0.10), and sometimes a huge amount of paid currency goes on sale at a massive discount. Black Squad is very generous. You can buy a booster to level up faster, but leveling up just gives you more currency, not perks/attachments/abilities, so it's still balanced,

tl;dr If you like clean, slimmed-down, modern FPS games, play it. It's absolutely worth your time."
12785,"Really really bad netcode, North America is dead and the guns are random recoil so it’s very difficult to manage the ak47s recoil efficiently 
Graphics are good for a free to play game but if you don’t get 100 FPS+ it’s unplayable
1.5/10"
12786,"I was browsing free to play steam fps's in search of a classic shooter. Not a tactical shooter like Rainbow six siege, but no a mindless run and gun like CoD. I found this. This is the EXACT game that I was looking for. The perfect mix of strategy, teamwork, etc, and also reflexes, skill, and it's just fun overall. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone who's a fan of shooters. Also it's free so try it out. Unfortunately, Warface exists and... it's better in almost every way."
12787,sdsd
12788,good for newbees
12789,Great games is this a game is great and love i play it so play it too come on do a barrel roll!
12790,Have a Very cool feeling is this game.
12791,Best game mixture of COD and CSGO :)
12792,Yesssss its free (no wonder).....horrible gameplay imo the graphics are gash and just trying to copy another hacker ridden game CS:GO!!! tbh i would rather shit in my hands and clap than play this again
12793,good game to play with friends lots of different maps and guns to chose from
12794,"matching is made me wait so long, sometimes it might take about thousand seconds"
12795,"Game with lots of potential, killed by its devs. I had to change my Positive review to a Negative review. They manually banned me saying I use cheats. RIP Founder's account, RIP unsellable skins, RIP Cobra account, RIP comp rewards Beta ~ Season 7. 2800 hours down the drain. They ban legit players with little to no proof. Not only did they not read my 5 tickets, they send me this at the end: ""At this point, we have provided all the available information about your request and no longer respond to the request. If you have an unrelated issue, let us know and we'll be happy to help"". GG WP getting banned and being muted. Don't play this game, you'll get banned if you're pro."
12796,best game <3
12797,"this game is very unfair no mic,team balance,and when in competitive ,and clanwar ,unfair matchmaking like wolf and eagle and lion vs all cobra 1,200 mmr vs 1,500 mmr tsk oits like a early access game
"
12798,Surely recommend!
12799,"Awesome F2P game.  No pay to win, only pay for graphical neatness.  Definitely worth getting!"
12800,"There is Pay-To-Win because you can buy currency for cheap and there's too small of a player base with many gamemodes. Now (as of December 2020), the free player shop can no longer purchase permanent weapons unless you grind out a ton of in-game currency and buy a loot box which will give you a random permanent weapon."
12801,fun casual like cod
12802,"tomuch adds dead game 
the home skreen is like a virise full of adds it takes a person 30m to find a button that says find game and then it takes a nother 40m to find a dead game with 1 team mate and 10 pros on the other"
12803,Could use an option to host a 1v1 or 2v2 match if you want to play with less people. And chat settings should be able to be saved to not have to press tab to switch to global chat all the time

12818,Good game.
12819,"Good game mechanics. But, the games feel a bit too easy for people that have played games like CS:GO for a 1000+ hours.

12820,"Actually like this over most F2P FPS'. Mechanics are good, graphics are decent. I have yet to run into any hackers. The only con I have is there was a few times I was playing 1v1 or 1v2 most matches instead of what was suppose to be 8v8."

If you don't care, It's cool.
"
12827,"THE CONS
1_Black Squad has the ♥♥♥♥♥iest servers and Net code ive ever seen in a game.
I have a Gigabit Internet Connection and still Rubber band at least once every round in Demolition....

2_The Assault Rifles Dominate Black Squad with horrible Hit Detection causing them to almost always Aimbot 
your Head. Its like playing CSGO with no vest and Helmet against pros...
except its just some kid spraying an AK at you... Oh, and you dont even have to ADS....

3_ Most people in Black Squad run an Assault rifle... Almost all of the Assault Rifles have a ♥♥♥♥ing Nube Tube attached to it and when they see you its almost 90% of the time that they will just nube tube you before they even try to actually shoot you with the gun..

4_ Sniping is Broken in the sense that you cannot accurately Drag scope, and what I mean by this is that even if your sites are on point the shot simply will not hit the enemy sometimes...

5_ North American Servers are Chock full of Latino Players for reasons I still do not understand...
the same problem happens in WarFace…
This really isn't a problem but these people dont really seam to respond to my reply's in English when I type in chat.
this leads me to believe that they are playing on the wrong servers because they get better lag compensation on our NA Servers...again, this is due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ netcode...
Asians are guilty of doing this as well and there's even a name for them... ""Pinger's""...

6_ The Chat system is just ♥♥♥♥ed... they sensor anything remotely close to being considered Cursing as well as limit how many characters you can type to about half that of CSGO's Chat System...

7_ Team Balancing is Non Existant…

8_No way to access Console or Terminal in the game for custom Binds...

9_ Black Squad Points... what the ♥♥♥♥ are they for?? they already have Bullets?? why not just use those??
""me"" spends five bucks on Bullets to buy some cases... 
wins a bunch of ""rented"" grenades.... gets couple hundred BS ( Bull ♥♥♥♥ ) tokens...
goes to the Medal store to spend them and.. OH LOOK!!! JUST ONE GUN WITH A SKIN ON IT COSTS 10 TO 30K
BS POINTS??? WTF!!! I could have just been givin the option to outright Buy the God damn skin from the store!!!
but OH LOOK AGAIN!!!
YOU CAN ALREADY DO THAT IN THE STEAM MARKET!!!! ……….. Idiots...

10_THERES STILL!!!! NO ♥♥♥♥ING VOICE CHAT !!! 
this has to be the worst part about this game... The original Korean Version Supports VOIP... so what gives??
how can you have a game with no Voice Chat then claim that the game is ESL ready???

11_ No way to change Secondary Weapon ADS Sensitivity.
I Play a Sniper on Black Squad, and so my ADS Sensitivity is 1.8 
well, that 1.8 Sensitivity carrys over to my side arm that now does not make sense for me to even ads with because the Sensitivity is too low...
this forces me to Hip Fire the weapon with my 7.5 Free Look Sensitivity which is now too high...


THE PROS
1_ Its free..
2_ its not Pay to Win 
3_ when your not Lagging, Gameplay does feel sort of smooth ( if your not playing the big team battle mode )
4_ The map designs aren't actually that bad. They even allow for good cross map nade and smoke spots.
5_ Runs about as well as CSGO on a Potato PC however Optimization is slightly worse than CSGO and with worse graphics...
I dont know if its the Textures they use or if there's just more unnecessary polygons in the maps and models
but I get about 10 FPS less than on CSGO's most basic maps such as Cache..."
12828,only one toon 2 choose from without spending real money so def no
12829,"this Game is so Cool!...
if you Like First Person shooter style i recommend this Game for u 
the Game style is like a Mix between Counter Strike and Call of Duty

i just have one Question.. why can't i (the player) sell My items in the community Market ?

that's all for Now :D"
12830,"Fun Game, I like the idea of your waiting room simulator 2018. best game of the world.,"

游戏是好游戏，玩了这么久确实也感觉挺良心的，虽然这游戏也有挂，但是不多，碰到外挂的概率20%吧，不知道为什么官方不管外挂，导致碰到的外挂都是级别贼高的，不要跟我说人家技术好你就酸人家什么的，那我问问，找人打跟碰到人打是一个概念么？你就是藏起来他都能静步找到你，我KD不高就1.8，，，那KD3.1是什么玩意？400把及基本没输过是什么鬼，战绩里只要他在就没死过是什么鬼？但是外挂终究是个别的，不能因为少数外挂而否定游戏，除了外挂我实在挑不出这游戏毛病，至于ping，我开加速器最低能80左右，很多加速器都是加速游戏本体，我的加速器就是，他显示300ping，但其实显示的ping不是正确的，进了游戏就80左右，建议进入AI房间测ping，最后希望官方能管理一下外挂吧。"

12842,"Fun and easy-to-learn FPS with good mechanics. It needs skill to be good in this game ; no pay-to-win problems.

Played it a little bit and pretty appreciated it."
12843,"this game is at best decent, playability is alright once you get used to the shooting. feels a little stiuff in the movements but not terrrible. worst thing about this game your basically forced to camp corners and doors."
12844,game sux
12845,"I really love this game but, hackers and toxic players ruined it, the anti cheat is worst because of the developers, they sell cheats to there clients....
bugs, weak servers, lags, bad skins, players from NA and ASIA can play in EU.

12850,"Is it just me or is it impossible to find a match? When I downloaded this game last night I did the tutorial and tried getting into a ""quick match"", but after sitting there for 10 minutes waiting for it to matchmake I just gave up and played CS:GO. Same thing this evening, tried to find a quick match but after waiting for 10+ minutes I got bored. Probably won't play again."
12851,i like black squad
12852,Very hard to find online games
12853,"Great game, just lessen the hackers. All in all great game."
12854,NICE!

12859,wow
12860,"For me it looks like another warface parody and I'll be honest menu of the game will look really confusing for new players, they put too much shit on the main menu, like, why? Why would I need to see what person opened a case with some item, like, just why? The gameplay looks pretty fine for such game but some weapons like dragunov are overpowered to be honest, you can literally 1tap people with it (like I do). 4/10"
12861,good game its just that so much lag and many people keep killing me in 1 sec becuz of lag and i cant see peopleand i do if i die
12862,Gian lận cái tổ sư mày à? Cứ đang chơi bình thường thì báo gian lận. Bọn óc chó này
12863,"Very fun to play, one of the best FPS free to play, not P2W. 
this game is only for fun not competitive at all and the developers very active there is always updates and new weapons."
12864,gg
12865,"its same as of CS:GO but good part is that it is free to play .Also i liked to have free skins in this game like free karambit (same as in CS:GO) and inspect mode is very good. I'm from Kolkata ,India and the servers were asian of singapore thats why had a ping of around 100-150. better if there was any Indian server"
12866,"5 servers I can go to whenever I want and obviously the server where I am is the fastest and it sucks because in NA there's is not a lot of people playing. Graphics is cool, but I don't have any idea why I won't dmg an enemy even if I died. There is literaly a freaking blood behind him from my shot. Headshot with anygun can one hit but only like 90% chance of one hitting sometimes no dmg at all. Should fix it when you two hit each other and only one die bc we clearly hit each other. Well this is still unfinished so that's no problemo but they should fix this. (came back after couple months but the body and the screen is still isnt in synch)"
12867,"I've played this game a lot, and I have rarely gotten board. The fact that it is a free to play game, but still has as many updates as it does is amazing. I recommend this game to pc biginners and veterans alike. The gun mechanics, maps, and gamemodes give a variety of experiences for all players. Not to mention the hundreds of skins that are available in paid boxes and on the Steam community market. The skins are cosmetic only, a player who has spent money, has no competitive advantage. all in all, when playing this game it is easy to forget that it is free to play."
12868,"They need to fire whoever design their maps. This is the only game I've ever seen such braindead, unbalanced map designs. Combat Arms has more balanced maps than this piece of shit game. 
On top of that, the developers constantly push out updates not for new content but for more lootboxes and weapon skins.
Overall this is a fun game if the developers weren't such money hungry wh0r3s and have more than 2 brain cells put into map design."
12869,Not that much played time but I can say so far im loveing this game....
12870,"This game totally blows... Mouse clicks (aka shooting) aren't registred half the time. This happens only in BlackSquad, NO OTHER programs/games have this issue. This results in frantically clicking the mouse, yet the game doesn't let you shoot. Which results in getting shot like a duck.
Aiming and shooting is just random luck. The game doesn't calculate 'real' positions, which results in 'ping cheaters'. Some people (cheaters) are artificially creating high ping on their computer. This delays the 'upload' to the game, which the cheaters use in their advantage to get the kills without getting shot themselves.
Do you want a free mindless shooter: go ahead and play the game.
Doo you want a sense of honesty: stay far away from this game."
12871,"BEST GAME 
yes is very good games
nice game"
12872,"Doesn't feel tactical, aiming is weird, limited gun selection and customization and overall a very clunky game in my opinion."
12873,"For a free game, this suprised me how fun it is. It gives me Combat Arms nostalgia. And so far been enjoying it!"
12874,if you dont have the money for call of duty play this
12875,A very different shooter indeed! Think if Cod map size had a baby with battlefield and csgo's child this is what you would get! This game is unique and I enjoy this game alot when im trying to take a break from games like Cod or CSGO. and the cool thing is its still a young game! 8.5/10
12876,free alternative of CSGO..
12877,high ping servers please fix
12878,BlAcK Squad is one of really amazing shooting games in the world .. there are a lot of skins and u can make money with them .. I got 200$ from that .. LiKe ..*-*
12879,"[quote=Neowiz]Amazing netcode[/quote] Didn't think so: avg. server tickrate of 30. The game favors high ping. Die behind walls. Shots that don't count. Ak12 1-shot-to-head? Not always, especially against laggy opponents."

Maps are cluncky it feels like im playing a roblox game. and there is like only 1 eu server place so if you play it west coast you are pretty much f**cked, 170-190 ping every game, its sad."

12897,for a frie to play game its good but is not good its poopoo
12898,"I use to love this game, but after couples months a lot of people start use a hackwalls and aimbot, I have a couple videos where you can see poeple kill you from nowhere and when you shot them ease they can take 5 shots on their face and still alive to shot you anywhere and kill you with 1 shot, that makes me angry. My advice play this game but before get a hackwall and Aimbot, because if you dont you will be disappointed. and frustared like a lot people like me."
12899,"Battleye Blocked a core windows element for some god forsaken reason, game no longer starts becasue of it. Would play again. (tried reinstalling doesnt help)."

12902,Too many Hackers
12903,Hitbox is shit.Class abilities are awfull they dont hit where you aim and you have to be precise in the middle of the fight Not worth it even for free
12904,"total garbage.
this game got potential but the devs are brainless autistic fucks with an IQ smaller than their dicks in cm.
The maps are horrible, not fun for casual modes, and not even suitable for any competitive game no matter how amateur it is. The meta is all about GLs, TDM is a shitfest of grenades. The netcode is total garbage, if you have 200 ping you're unkillable. The competitive mode is a fucking joke, no balance at all, it's always a very good team against newbies.

CSGO is free now, just leave this piece of crap alone and go for anything else. Dont waste your time."
12905,Decent game :D
12906,"Pretty good. Enjoy Yeeting with the bois. If you good @ me otherwise idk, leave or smth"
12907,"very nice game!
мне впринципе не нравился cs,и все остальное в этом роде bf3....

12908,"having customisation would be nice because some guns have worse signs etc. than other weapons. for example having a red dot for AK-47 would be useful for long range.

"
12909,The game is more like Call of Duty + CS Go.  Great gameplay and Maps. This is the game that stimulates my senses! Good job Devs for keeping the game up to date in every season.
12910,"FULL of cheaters!!! DEV do something!! Its great game but,..........."
12911,"this game runs like actual dog shit. i have a top of the line pc, very good internet ( usually about 20 ping at most) but for some reason whenever i try to play this game every slight movement of my mouse causes the game to stutter. i have tried adjusting the settings to the absolute worst possible and this still happens. 0/10 would not recommend for anyone trying to play this game. if you like wasting space on your hard drive 10/10"
12912,Its a good game yes. But can you guys even put reporting system in it  because there's still very toxic players in the game.
12913,"It's meh. Overall boring after a few hours, and lots of good guns locked beind medals and money."
12914,basically cs but with ads
12915,"The game was fun at first. Then i noticed more and more hackers.... The best part is that you cant report them.. To bad, the game had potential but its now dying because of hackers. GG it was fun while it last"
12916,"Its a good game . feels like a somewhat perfect mixture of Call of Duty and CSGO. good game mechanics. One thing that this game has better than csgo is , you can have a good knife without spending a huge money."
12917,Many Many CHEATERS
12918,AWESOME GAME MAN i was just wondering why everytime the minimap pops up my frames drop from 60 to 10 even in the deploy section of the game where it shows a bigger version of the game but overall GREAT game!

GOTY 2018"
12945,"First thing about Black Squad, it's free. So I wasn't expecting much about it as most F2P on the market are just average.
But this game feels great. it's actually the only F2P FPS on which I spent more than 150 hours. 

The shooting feels great, more arcade than CS:GO, no patern just a dispersion diamond. It's fast paced, but you'll pay every mistakes. It is about everythings you'll want from a F2P FPS. Absolutly not P2W, everything but cosmetic can be obtain with in-game currency, no real wallet needed.

The game got it's flaws tho. Even if the hitreg is good, the lack of localized servers shows in when eastern europe shows up as servers are located in England. And the game is quite unfair whith those who got a good ping against those who's not. You'll sometimes have the feeling to fall in one bullet when you're not supposed to, you'll see people teleporting around at 200+ ping. The community is as toxic as every (F2P) FPS. And some people also have no walls and even aim assist. 

Overall, if you want to enjoy a fast paced FPS, with awsome shooting mecanics and you are ready to, sometimes, face people with some unfair advantages, the game is for you. But if you want a AAA feel with no technical issue at all, no toxicity, no cheaters and no laggers, this game isn't for you. (And I want the name of this game please)
"
12946,"Shitty controls, bad movement, terrible concept, knock off graphics, and loot crates are the only thing keeping the servers alive. Don't even waste your time."
12947,"10/10 met my bing bong girlfriend on this game. 
20/10 would profit off skins again
pretty dope if you don't want to buy CSGO or don't like how you can't aim down your sights. it's like it made a child with alliance of valiant arms."
12948,"Play Warface over this. Black Squad's graphics are terrible. Matchmaking takes minutes, and you end up playing against the top players right off the bat. The language is auto-translated. I don't see what else there is to say about this game. Simply not worth your time when there are many, better free-to-play games."
12949,Very Good game for those who are new to first persion shooters. Graphics are one of the best i have ever seen in an online multiplayer game
12950,"The game is very cool but it has the worst community ever, everybody is camping and the map are made for people that camps lol"
12951,"The game used to work, but now that I have a wireless mouse it won't let me play, I used to play all the time with a mouse, but it is still an amazing game to play for free, a 5 out of 5, I can fix te mouse part easily"
12952,Good Game!
12953,kinda bad but is OK.
12954,"Honestly The gameplay is awesome for multiplayer, the PVE modes are great as well."
12955,"At it's core it has the potential to be great but as of writing this, the amount of aimbotters and cross fire spawn campers every other game makes it miserable to play."
12956,"Best Free to play FPS
 
"
12957,"This game I’d say is better than most triple A titles like CoD, CSGO, etc. The graphics are great, gameplay is smooth, maps are evenly spaced. The only problem I have with this game is the NA servers not having that much of a player base."
12958,h
12959,best free fps and a great game to earn some $.in game skins are cool too :)
12960,Black squad = black screen
12961,"Muito bom , Super recomendo ."
12962,Best F2P FPS game so far
12963,I Kinda Like It The Guns Are SOOO COOL! Even Just By Looking At Them Definitely Worth IT!
12964,"super fun game for being free. I, Myself was quite surprised when i first played it couple summers ago. im honestly excited to see how weel it runs on my new desktop. I'd definetly recommend playing this game"
12965,🔥✔
12966,"Black Squad's my new favorite FPS shooter for PC.  The developers coded so many things right with this game.  Great looking maps with single spawn areas, real weapons, runs well on lowend computers, fast matchmaking, a lot of updates, and the best skill oriented competition.  I like it better than Fortnite and Call of Duty combined.  No DLC or pay to win tactics.  Any gun can be yours from day 1.  The community's large enough to play even at night or 24 hours."
12967,Really good and really similar to counter strike.
12968,Shite!!
12969,< csgo
12970,i liked the game in the past but got tired of it so i decided to come back and i must say it has changed these past couple of year's but the change that i find annoying is my gun changes every time i kill someone it's very annoying and i trying to find out why it happens in the forum but not having any luck on responses yet. :/ i played the game for about 30mins an tried to get into it again but this changing guns on every kill is ruining that for me
12971,nc game
12972,"Yes,"
12973,FIX THIS GAME PLEASE!
12974,"So, after a year of playing this game I found out that it's a very good game, just the problem is it has some issues. For example, the North America server has too few players (e.g. competitive match, no matter when you try to play, you can't because there is not enough people in the server, as in europe, you can play whenever you want because of the amount of people). This is a problem in the game. Also, some of the mechanics are a bit messed up. For exemple, sometimes when you shoot somebody in the head, they don't die, but instead, they end up killing you. And out of the things mentioned above is the worst part about the game: The matchmaking system. In the game, there is a competitive mode where you compete to get a rank. In this mode there is a system of ranking, a certain amount of point to show your skill (These points then put you in a rank category); However, in the normal mode (mostly quick matches) once you get a good start in the game you get placed with people that are higher rank than you. To show this, I have reached level 50 in game(Captain Step 6) and during quick matches the game has a tendency to put me with people that are ranks 60-90, which is absolutely ridiculous. This also makes it very hard to rank up in game from playing all the time. Overall, it's a great game besides what I just talked about, and I would recommend it to pretty much anyone."
12975,"this is a good game i like it
"
12976,"It used to be good but now it's just bad no recoil,shit graphics and u can't talk in game"
12977,nice
12978,its fun lelz
12979,i have a 64 bit windows and for some reason it dowloads a 32 bit version and i cant run it can someone help me ?
12980,Most of the players here are trash who whining about hackers cuz they can't aim.
12981,Like it says this game is still in built andi dont like it so far
12982,like call of duty but shity and made for the chineses market
12983,does not have australian server you will have like 270+ping regardless which makes playing pointless and no way of enjoying yourself till they give us ocianic servers i wont recommend playing this if you from australia or new zealand
12984,"[h1][b]Black Squad[/b][/h1]

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Gameplay is thoroughly enjoyable, never getting repetative.  It offers both 'quick play' and 'competative' modes each offering several of their own gamemodes. Gun mechanics are executed very well and every gun has its own distinct feel. On the topic of weapons, Black Squad offers a massive variety of them meaning you will be able to find your own style of playing. Though you may thing they can't all be that good, if there are so many of them, I'd say you're wrong. All weapons are distinct and work perfectly.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Put simply I was shocked. In my own opinion set on 'Ultra' as well as 'Real time shadows' - which I certainly reccomend using if you have the game - look much better than those of the very famous CS:GO. Though it is opinion based I can say it has better lighting and more detailed textures. I can run on the previously stated settings on a 'mere' 1050 ti 4GB GDDR5, and some friends run this game smoothly at 'High' on even lower spec PCs.

[h1]Load times[/h1]
On a normal HDD I never loaded in last of my group or had to miss a match because of slow loading times, but if you want to get into offline matches or the UI of an online one then an SSD would help out a lot. On my Samsung 970 Evo load times feel almost instant but if I were to render a guess I would say no more than 3 or 4 seconds to load into a game. The only hindrance on the initial load speed of the game from launching it is that before you can press play on Black Squad's own launcher you have to wait for 'Maintenance.' This is not the fault of hardware but whatever the game is doing I honestly do not know. Many online games do not require this 'Maintenance' but for the most part takes no longer than 3 or 4 seconds but can still be fustrating after launching it day after day.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Overall, I believe this is definately worth the (at time of review) 5.8GB of storage space - as a free game. It may not match up to the gameplay of something like CS:GO, but keep in mind this is a 'free to play' game and is still in its 'early access' but also when considering that it runs surprisinly glitch/bug free and is overall just a fun FPS. It can be a serious competative game for you or just a game you open for a half hour when you're bored, either way, it's worth it."

PREVIOUS:
Loved the game when started play few months back - fast action, addictive battles BUT lately 80% of players percent are cheating and making sniped kills through smoke with AK47 - the most difficult gun in the game. 

Sad, now I need to finda new game. 

This one had fun battle modes like destruction and airborne- very nice, don't know why is everyone so addivted to battle royal gameplay where you loot 75% of the time and specate 20% and fighting just 5%. Where in black squad it's 100% action, loved it!

13006,"After playing a full days worth of Black Squad and 83 matches, I've not noticed a single hacker. So either I'm lucky or the people reviewing this game negatively claiming theres ""a wave of hackers"" or its ""a hack-fest"" are just not good at the game and think everyone cheats who's better than them.

It's a good game. No pay-to-win. Guns feel good, although the recoil on the AKs is really quite ridiculous to the point where you can only single-tap. Theres some hit-reg issues. 
Biggest problems so far are not enough players and ""error with the anti-cheat program"" bugs which just randomly started happening after 2 weeks of playing fine with no issues are annoying and keep closing the game. 

Plus anime chicks with jiggle physics."
13007,Better version of CS (for those who want a gunfight and not a shopping simulator).
13008,Bad
13009,"ALL WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS :
FREE TO PLAY CSGO WITH BETTER FEATURES :)"
13010,Its very impressive for a early access game i mean it has the projectiles of cs and u really don't need to aim but still pretty fun has some good skins and alot of free dlc's
13011,Utter garbage.

13018,O meu jogo não está abrindo ;-; algm me ajd
13019,This is a great free fps shooter i highly recommend
13020,"I don't like this game
It's free
Many people have things that look pay 2 win.

5/10 would play game again"

good tym pass if u ple wid yur frenzzz"

13024,great game
13025,best game i ever play!
13026,.....
13027,good game
13028,Not recommended if you want a smooth-like fastpaced gameplay like COD or competative gameplay like CS:GO.
13029,"Hit detection makes zero sense. A SCAR can kill you with one shot from across the map, but a sniper to the chest takes up to three hits to get a kill.

Nobody works together and bunny hopping is everyone's favorite tactic besides crouching on and off between shots. You also can't go prone.

Spawn killing is WAY TOO EASY in this game even with the spawn delay. Boxes are a joke if you aren't spending money on bullets. No no no. Another FPS cash grab filled to the brim with toxic players.

You'll be sitting for way too long waiting for a match. Community feels dead."
13030,<3.
13031,"Fun game but that is if you can get into a match. The place seems dead and there is hardly anything to do if you cant get in a game. Also if you are in queue you are trapped because you cant do anything else but wait, if you want to update anything or change out weapons you have to leave queue."
13032,"Pretty fun game, I casually play it(been having it for almost a week now) and I'm very good as well. Do I recommend the game? Yes I do, try it out because if you're bored of your current games or need a small break this is a game to come to(there are many other good alternative games too for you to search for).Now cons, I feel like the North American servers are pretty small, not a lot of quick matches to get into unless you play customs, but the Europe servers are still well populated so try it if your ping is good. Personally I think ping issue is normal to the game just from observation, I mean my net is good and I know it's but hey  the game is playable. I don't think I will stick with the game for a year but I will enjoy my time on it, and remember in this game objective is important so play smart and don't forget about your objectives. I notice a lot of players hold back and camp when it comes to capture the flag, and half the time barely anyone caps because they stay back too far to do it. Camping won't make you good in my opinion and it's not that much of a strat if you get killed while camping(trust me I killed ppl doing that shit a lot) so yea good luck."

Edit:
Well it was once a great game with good potential now it just dead with devs taking a money milking way"

13046,"Awful even with graphics on highest it looks like something that would have been 'high end' in 2005. The tutorial alone induced cringe with it's cliche b-grade action movie lines and 'events.'

this game is good but one thing is REALLY BAD,
Drop rates of gun with skin is lower than 0.01%
spent a lot of ingame cash ""bullets"" but never had good gun with good skin,
because ""THOSE GUN ARE FOR ONLY PLAYERS WHO SPEND A THOUSAND DOLLAR ON THIS GAMES""
"
13054,This game is really nice overall no doubt. So far the best fps for free on the market! I highly recommend it.
13055,Its was so nice
13056,Simple but fun game. No harm in trying it out. has me addicted ;)
13057,nice game
13058,yes
13059,I have played Black Squad since there was no Rank Match system and Asia Servers near 2017 and i kinda stopped playing it back then because cheaters were taking all over the server using unlimited bullets for the grenade launchers and i was kinda frustated back then.So i decided to play again since last 4 weeks and i have seen a lot of differences in game and the game was totally improving every update i would totally recommend this game to all the people i know and share moments that i had made.I hope you will not let us down and keep doing what you developers wanted to do.I wanted to suggest something i hope in the future you guys will add some skins that are from the community and let us make our own custom calling card that would be all and thank you.
13060,"can't reconnect to the match if u get disconnected, uninstalling"
13061,no words can describe how bad this is. Luckly its free to play.
13062,it's okay
13063,"Good competitive game but unfair matchmaking system on the otherside.
Many Crashes In-game makes the game unplayable for competitiveplayers.
I got 2 Penalties because i got a crash in last round of competitive match.
It is definitly a big problem of the game."

13075,I would like it if people actually communicated unstead of running around blindly and the fact that the game screen will just turn black. I can hear everything and shoot but I literally can't even see my screen I have to quit the game. kinda bullshit when you are playing ranked
13076,This game is awesome! Bcz it's easy to play and anyone can master it. Simply loving it.
13077,Great game!! Love it
13078,"the game its self is fine, but the amazon servers aren't. and because the devs aren't trying to do anything about their shitty servers the game will retain its name of ""a trashy f2p shooter that isn't worth your time.""

13081,"its alright
"
13082,I love this game it fun I like the skin in this game  it awesome you should play it to
13083,"I have countless hours logged on this game (my brothers account). I absolutely love it. I used to only play console shooters, but this ended up being my first real mouse and keyboard FPS. My friends back in Asia introduced me to this game and I'll admit, it didn't seem like much at first. I played team death match my first game and I get absolutely rekt. I was like wtf is this game and why is the killing so pointless. I came back to it because my friend told me about demolition and I fell in love. He carried me, but I loved the sense of strategy and skill. Getting kills is so rewarding because that person won't respawn till the next round. The game gives you the most accurate gun in the game to start (but it does do lower damage as the tradeoff). All the weapons are very easy to earn. Theres different types of currencies each with their own way of earning. Medals are earned by ranking up with exp. Gold is won in matches or by logging in. Black Squad Coins are won in boxes (or by logging in). Lastly, bullets are the paid currency to reset K/D, change names, and buy random lootcrates. The game has some nice weapon skins that can be earned legit, but I did find myself loving the game so much I bought a couple skins on the steam market for cheap. (oh yeah theres a steam market check it out). The game is pretty well optimized, and the friend system is a little confusing at first, but just google it and youll be fine. I love love love this game. It forced me to get good. The North American server is a little empty during certain times of the day, so I play in the EU and SA servers. Just youtube Black Squad and you'll find a whole community that loves playing this game. (Search up Flexinja his videos are awesome). 

Don't listen to other people. There have been a lot of updates that have fixed bugs and I rarely see hackers. Most of the time if I die, its because the person killing me is just better. The weapons are pretty balanced (but not every game is perfectly balanced just look at CSGO). Keep in mind that each weapon has the statistics in the shop, but those don't include things like spray pattern, reload time, and the overall feel of the gun. The game does let you try out guns as timed weapons on the DLC page (but trust me all the guns you earn by purchasing are permanent except grenades but theyre really cheap). Also check out the first year anniversary package and the welcome box on the DLC page. Youll get some free stuff to help you out. The quick matches can be just a tad bit unbalanced sometimes, so its best to play with some friends, so your team might have a chance. Competitive is a little better, but sometimes you'll get rap*d because youll get matched with unranked people and the other team will have all ranked people. The only thing thats slightly slightly slightly unfair is the fact that theres a gun that can only be found in lootcrates that has the same exact stats as the regular AK, but it has a reflex sight which really helps. If you have good aim, it shouldn't matter. Other than that the game stands by its words. No pay to win. Sometimes the community can be toxic (not as bad as CSGO but it can get bad). The report system isn't ingame so that sucks too, but its the internet so keep that in mind. Don't let them get to you and strive to improve :)

TL:DR If you like FPS games and things that are free, try the game out."
13084,Graphics are awsome <3 HAHAHA Try this game
13085,awlsome it is a fun game to play
13086,its gud if u dont have $$ for bo4
13087,nice
13088,not very good
13089,"So i've Played Black Squad for a solid 250 hours..

It's a good game!
Really beautiful
I love every update
I love the BETA Competitive mode and the whole PVE mode
My problem is...

The AKs,
I'm talking about all three,
And the M4,
The AK47 way too strong,
The AK12 same thing just less recoil and less power,
The AK ZHUKOV a litteral combination of the ak12 and ak47 less recoil, more power,
like I know you got to have one shot kills but damn bro if that's the case acr, k2c mdr and hnk should should instantly kill you via headshot not three shots to the dome.

I really like this game I REALLY freaking do but the whole 3 shots to the chest and you dead with the ak series is ridiculous man please nerf 'em.

I hope to see you add an offline feature to practice without a internet connection
Much love to the entire team who worked and is still working on this game i hope it never dies out
oh and add add suppresion please we need suppresion!"
13090,"Can't even change my settings without needing to reboot PC, awful UI and even worse sound/voice design."
13091,Cool game. Like other tactical shooters players earn money by playing games and use it to purchase new weapons to use on the battlefield. Play each round as either the Vipers (Terrorists) or the Peacekeapers (UN Backed Counter-Terrorists) across multiple maps and game modes.
13092,Beautiful game 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
13093,"Im glad its free, because i wouldnt pay for it"
13094,"So far for a free game it's not bad. You get some good DLC to start with. It gives you an idea of what works for you. The woapons are all balanced from what I can tell. I don't see any pay to win atvantage, just skins (if you like that stuff) Guns with high rate of fire are low in damage and high damage have slower fire and more recoil (normal ranges- nothing looks OP). The middle of the power vs. RPM seems best for me so far. Has a CS/GO feel but slower and gun machanics are almost COD like. Most kills from the hip at mid range for me. Have yet to see hackers but what game (free or paid) dosent have hackers? Worth playing. If you don't like it - uninstall it, no loss."
13095,neil frank approves
13096,best game

13100,"After get banned from CSGO because of no reason (No hack, no rage quit,..) i decided to play the other FPS game and BlackSquad is this one. In 10 hours of beginning, this game is quite peculier for me, 4,5 kill per deathmatch is the best result for me. But after all, i got used to BlackSquad and my aim is gonna better. My KDA is more than 1. Now, UpRank everday is my routine xD. Thank a lot to NeoWiz. Hope your product become more popular in the future. Always moving forward NeoWiz. And the last word: Never let cheaters ruin your interested game.
P.s: dont forget giving players your free skins <3"
13101,meh
13102,this is the best game i have ever played and its FREE NO pay to win a wepon for everyone great weapon skins some people call it a rip off of csgo maybe... but if it is its a better game than csgo blackops4 and tf2 i have all of these games
13103,Spawns ruin all credibility for this game
13104,"In my opinion this game is one of the best free to play shooters out there. The only downside is the obvious hackers and the lack of any server close to me in the North West, My ping is always over 90 to 100 in this game, some days even worse. and If there was a way to talk to team mates other than them being your friends ina discord or using the crappy text chat system to talk to randoms that woul be great."
13105,"Really recomment it but, make my csgo aim become really bad. 
Overall the game is still very good!
Great Graphics but sometime noobs teammate and also hacker but they can fix the mm things and also the anti-cheat!"
13106,"Alright I've changed my mind.
Yes this game is a normal shoot'em up game, and no this game has sh!t ton of pros so, I would say this game isn't very ""Newbie friendly"".
But uh meanwhile this game is actually really fun. I do actually enjoy this game. You can buy weapons on the SCM with cheap prices. I don't even need to spend more than a dollar to buy my personal favourite shotgun and pistol. Wait this isn't the point of the game-
But anyways, if you want to play this game. One word of advice. Don't. Well unless you are prepared to get DEMOLISHED by pro players in the game. Or if you had experience from a certain music game that if your ranking is at 6 digit and you can't play insane difficulty you will get called as a noob but you don't care about it, then you can play this game without stress.
Okay jokes aside and for the conclusion, this game is really fun but kinda hard to actually git gud if the opposite team has like sh!t ton of pro players, and you know, and if you're trash-"
13107,i find it a very good game
13108,This game is kinda good for f2p players. But CSGO still better.

13115,"This game should been epic, it plays smooth, it has awesome options and gear.

But it's a free game, and sadly this means i've playd 7 minutes, in that 7 minutes, 4 cheaters where caught thanks to battleEye. Does that any good to the game? likely not.

It's A full of cheaters game, and deserve his own gerne: FCG (Fps Cheating Games)

"
13116,Good Free Game
13117,"i have ben playing for about a month or two and have liked the main offering of the game (PVP) the guns are fun to use, skins look nice and lots of fun game modes. the only proplem i face is the PVE, this is because any time a play a game at about round 3-5 it will shutdown the whole game. i can only forgive the game because the PVP more than makes up for it. i havent met any hacker, but many less skilled player cry ""hacks"" or ""cheater"". 
final thoughts everyone should give this game a try it's free has great gameplay and a mostly great overall experence"
13118,"The game has all the workings of a functioning FPS, except nobody plays it."
13119,"pretty good first person, its like CSGO/CoD put together."

This is basically the free version of C.O.D. This game has great features, guns, skins, and gameplay. I wonder how so many people haven't heard about it!"
13125,"This game is absolutely amazing!
 Better than a lot of paid games I've played! 
Great in-Game economy & great competitive gameplay and the customization is just done right! 
Not pay-to-win at all, it's play-to-win! 
The game is fun , addictive, satisfying and FREE!
 Do recommend!🗡🔪💣"

If there weren't any hackers it would be a great game"
13133,Was good at release.It's just a bad cash grab now because all they do is make skins f money.
13134,gooooooooooooooooooooooooooog
13135,Hey dev i think u need to check some validation and condition bcoz if we kill 150 or 160 in TDM still it display like LOSE. What the hell is this man and need to rework on UI its very confusing for new user and not so user friendly. Please fix it and BTW its very cool game. Thanx Dev
13136,"eh not gonna blow you away but not bad by any mean, just a bit of good fun so take this as you will"
13137,"Updates are almost non-existent, patchnotes are just a poor little copy-paste of ""fixes"" about very rare or never-seen-before ""bugs"". The new publisher house ""Valofe"" apparently  doesn't have any ideas on how to proceed with the improvement of this game. I received a permanent ban back in 2018 but somehow i can still playing. YAY, that's all. 

100% not recommended, avoid this game!"
13138,im glad this cool game is free
13139,"Don't play this game , it is full of hackers and dev support it. They ban anyone who talk about it in forum and anticheat does not even work. Dev  are probably selling cheats in the back for money, top clans are mostly hackers  , 70-90% chance to  meet hacker in every match"
13140,issues running to changing from Ultra made my 550 go nuts and made me almost do the same F*** off
13141,"-Stupid Name
-Strange Video
-Fantastic Gameplay
 
10/10 Would question the Validity Again."
13142,deez nuts
13143,"I've been playing shooters since I was a kid and I have to admit that this one is totally not making any sense to me, especially when we're talking about deathmatch. Spray control is barely needed, broken spots for snipers are making your life harder, bomb spams are very unnecessary in my opinion and that's also the factor that is making your gaming experience ruined. People are capable of running into enemy bases and killing everybody. That must fixed. The gap between average and good players is very small because of concept of the game. So how am I looking at it? If you are gonna play this like 2-3h a day, you'll get to the level where you can compete against anyone. The shooting system is simple, the only thing you need here is reaction. So I'll say that you need 80% of reaction timing and 20% of skill which i consider as aim accuracy that you gain over time. So I am very sure that many things needs to be inovated and fixed in order to make this game better. As I said, gap between average and good players are small. Competitive isn't really something that I got attracted to. This game feels more like a good deathmatch, fast shooter and capture the point mode. Deathmatch is rollercoaster and it can get frustrating just because of broken spot abusing. Do I recommend playing this game? Well, I will say no and that's my opinion, but if you are looking for a crazy fast shooter, go ahead. However this is just my opinion because I am not quite sure if developers wants to make this game competitive or just a crazy fast shooter which anyone can play with average shooting skill. If the point of the game is enjoying fast deathmatch, it's good but if the point of the game is competition and making sure that we realize the gap between good shooter player and bad, it's not."
13144,"like Ironsight and CS:GO had a baby, super fluid, super fun, super rewarding, very fast paced and good for casuals and fraggers alike. AND IT'S FREE!
*Edit, I'm still playing and it's as fun as ever! I hope it stays around for a long time, would love to get into competitive scenes etc. The game is in a great spot right now for both casuals and hardcore players alike.

13152,Absolute trash :/
13153,"TL;DR This game is a CS:GO-inspired FPS that's great for casual gaming, especially since it's free. 

Some people complain about the hackers, I have never felt like I was facing a hacker and I've played for over a few months now. Plus it uses BattlEye anti-cheat, which is decent enough. If there's a hacker or something, just move to another match-room. 
Attendance rewards are a nice touch.
Definitely an active development, because there's usually new updates and implements about every couple of weeks or so. It's nice."

13158,"Very fun game especially with the new modez they've put in it's fun to play
"
13159,"Cheat protection is useless, matchmaking is terrible, and if not for that the game is quite good. Toxic community is a must in all f2p games, so it's kinda tolerable, also you have mute option for chat just in case. Good news though, the fixed the loading times but kept the freezes and quick scope exploit. Only game modes that have high population are 5vs5 demolition and TDM, as well as event maps. Probably won't change at all, but I'm still playing as sometimes it's actually not as terrible as it seems."

13174,is good
13175,"Don't even consider this game, there are so many cheaters they may as well call it Cheat Squad"
13176,s'aight

13181,graet game
13182,"Black Squad is the best free to play game I’ve played on Steam. It plays like a cross between Counter Strike & Call of duty, with a rewarding ranking system & a zero pay-to-win environment. It’s a purely skill based, fast paced game that features small maps to get you into the fight quickly. The gun play is smooth, kills feel satisfying, & you can excel using hip fire or ADS. The graphics & sound are also sharp for a free to play title. I seriously recommend trying it, there’s no risk involved with it being free to play. If you grind you’ll do well."
13183,"One of The best FPS Games right now and this is just a Early Access Game, so if the studio released the full Game we will be amazed by the Great quality of it"
13184,This is a fun active first person shooter i highly recommend
13185,"Is fundamentally a brilliantly fun game to play, but far, far, FAR, to many hackers with no solution coming from the devs aside from ways to separate you from your hard earned cash by hiding the best items behind paywalls.

Will probably change my review if things improve, but until then it stands as is."
13186,bro you cant say black
13187,a Very Nice Game if i'd say so myself.
13188,"This is the best free shooter game I have ever played!!!
"
13189,"An absolutley great f2pfps game its easy to get credits and badges as long as you do well and you get free rewards everyday to help out as well as credits rewarded to you every match. The game has an ads option but most times its best to just hip and memorize some of the recoil patterns 

Overall: 8.5/10"
13190,idk i have 23hrs played bcoz i open the launcher and didnt notice!
13191,"This game is RLYYYYY trash trying play for good skins... MAP so unbalnced. AND SHOOTING so UNREAL!!!! HOW CAN BE SOME FPS WORST THEN CSGO :D



BETTER WHEN YOU ARE AFK.... YOU GET MORE WIN THEN YOU PLAY :DDDDD NICE GARBAGE PLS SHUT DOWN THIS TRASH!!!"
13192,10/10 game
13193,this game is pure trash no recoil no nothing trash trash trash
13194,I can't open halloween box with scary key ? That's error. Help me
13195,"this game takes the best in (COD, CSGO and BF) and it is free
hope all games are like this game the developers made a great effort 
but i have seen many cheat ways online i dont know if they are correct

*** some ppl in this game are using hacks for sure and the game isnt doing any reporting system for them****"
13196,I like it
13197,You know this game is actually super good and actually a ton of fun. It's free to play too and actually not pay to win. You get so much free stuff from just playing the game especially from events. Definitely give the game a shot.
13198,"good game

13206,This game is good if you want CSGO but for Free
13207,nice
13208,good game to play
13209,"Saying that you can't buy weapons is a venomous lie, as many weapons are locked behind loot crates and most deadly of all is the fact weapons are only RENTALS. Furthermore the actual gameplay is [i]nothing[/i] like the trailer. There isn't even a prone button. The game plays just like your average korean counter strike knockoff, rather than battlefield or the like.
A complete ripoff. I want a refund on the hour I spent."
13210,Just being frank its a garbage overly cluttered UI and they immediately thrust you into a tutorial (for a FPS really? a tutorial? pathetic devs is more like it) that does not allow you the ability to actively change your settings SO if your mouse sense isnt at an already perfect level before that tutorial SORRY BOUTCHA
13211,"un muy buen juego

13222,issssa boat
13223,One of the best FPS game on steam....And the interesting part is that this is free!!!
13224,"The movement system felt clunky at best, and the shooting mechanics were pretty basic. It felt like a mediocre mobile shooter port."
13225,I guess jumping around while shooting makes you a better player. Uninstalling.
13226,its cool i guess
13227,This is very nice game. Everyone should play this game
13228,"EDIT: the devs made this game worse than any cod. 
---------------------------------------------

good game.
best f2p shooter ive ever played so far. 
good mechanics, well designed maps and no p2w."
13229,Nice
13230,there are litterally no players in this game.
13231,10/10 would shoot again
13232,"i love but he crash :(
"
13233,"In my opinion, you should try this.
- Free 2 play like legit Free
- Skin only SKin . NO BUFF. NO PLUS or Shiit
- Spend alot of time to deal with ""what i called NOOBTUBE""
- Have Zoom for Every gun - except the AK47
- NO NEED IN-GAME PURCHASED 
Support those guys for more content cuz they made a really good F2P FPS game ever 
Also, boobs XD"
13234,"very good
"
13235,"I don't know why but before the Halloween update, it was so smooth, but after that, the gameplay is kind of stutter and skipping also. It is not lag but some other issue that I don't know about. So, please fix it. Thank you"
13236,"nice graphics,nice gun,nice sound and nice gmae :)"
13237,best game in world i like a game mostly
13238,"-Spending free earnable ingame currency to receive crate

-crate needs key

-key costs 2bucks

-wtf lol deinstall"
13239,even for free to play still mahhh warface much better and its also free to play
13240,"Too many cheater, game already dead!!! Dont waste your time and money! So sad, i really enjoy this game."
13241,Not the best F2P game on the market like the description says but definitley the best one on steam at least in my opinion. I guess i just like more fast paced games. But a game that is definitley the best free to play in my opinion is ironsights its not on steam but its definitley worth it. Its much more fast paced and has more of a CoD feel to it. https://ironsight.aeriagames.com/
13242,"I enjoy this game with me and my friends
I'd recommend if u want to have fun with ur friends or if u like playing by urself"
13243,horrible to many bugs.
13244,Disliked
13245,"good game

13246,great game
13247,the main menu needs more work to make it easier for the users :D
13248,The game wont work for me. I'm getting 1fps on the title screen and can't find anything related to it online. I have an 8700k and a 1080Ti.....
13249,this is an awsome game! alot of pure skill and strategy to kill enemies. but the match making is off :( please add that
13250,Free to play Counter Strike.
13251,"It just sometime the game drop FPS on ya and it can be frusturated .
Overall , good free to play shooter , easy to accquire weapons and the only thing micro transaction is waepons skin for cosmetic"
13252,[b]Fast-pace gameplay with awesome graphics[/b]
13253,nice game !!!!!!
13254,NO PAY TO WIN...FAIR FIGHT
13255,...
13256,cant't open game. failed to open privacy files.
13257,"Crashed 4 times launching, crashed twice more closing.
9/10 would recomend"
13258,The game is ok but the constant stuuters and fps drops are ruining it to the ground. And what's the deals with the haloween event free keys it said that i have 607/600 play time and i didnt get any keys why?
13259,Please fix the game.
13260,i cant play in this game
13261,"Nice game, try it. I desinstalled it after 3 hours of playing because of a memory leak bug that I can't fix, caused probably by the game itself. You will enjoy it if you don't encounter the same bug."

If u like shooting games try it !"
13272,fuck
13273,Your game is a big junk in the fps gaming village. There are too many hackers that you can not fix it. I suggest adding the kick function to the player during the game.
13274,"this game my love every day i play it to make me happy :3

l3ba rbha gamz
31-10-2020"
13275,"The game has potential, I would like more interesting and balanced maps and PVE modes with a campain Story. Not only it would attract more players for the game but it would be a refreshing option when you get burned out with pvp.
There are still some lag issues that some of the shots don't register but with time i guess it would be fixed as well as unreal shots and handling some of the guns have for example the sniper m103 that some of the shots  follow almost a unbelievable almost 90 degree angle to the roof from the barrel of the sniper."
13276,really fun game and easy to play.
13277,Good game
13278,ruins your life
13279,"I have been playing this game for a few months now, unfortunately the game is broken. Lag issues are really high and at some moments the game is unplayable. The game runs on DirectX-9 and is 32-bit. Very old technology. 
My ping is from 28-40ms on EU server and my PC is brand new and good:
OS Windows -10 Home 64-bit
Processor -Intel Core i3 @ 3.60GHz Kaby Lake
RAM -8.00GB DDR4
Graphics -4.00GB GDDR5 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti

AT THE MOMENT: I wouldn't suggest anyone to download it. If it weren't for lag it would've been a pretty good game. And please don't put any money in the game, it just isn't worth it.
P.S. Developers say they are aware of the issue and they are apologizing but it isn't fixed."
13280,Awesome
13281,"The game is in constant developpement and i can say that it is aiming upwards. There are issues here and there but if and when people try to give feedback about it, it surely helps the devs. The game has its own style game mode that works awesomly and is very fun to play (bonus if u play with frieedns) and it has iconic modes such as demolition where u plant and defuse, survivals with different gun types. Theres even a 32 player maps where you go Battlefield style. Can't really say that its as good as any other mode but it needs improvement. The games Assassination mode is that unique game mode I mentioned earlier and is about taking down the VIP or protecting him. Some might say its pay to win but its not because of the way everything is chained and works in game, you can pay for cosmetics and accessoires but you can also get the same weapons with default skins in the Medal Store, which serves for a purpose. All you need to do to get medals is to play the game. Although there are several points of improvement that need to be made like adding different guns that are few in the game right now, they still dont get in the way of gameplay. In addition you can get rare items like BS coins or keys while playing weekly or so. Oh and... Free DLCs, they are cool."
13282,lot of spwan kill
13283,Very nice game and very fluid.
13284,Very Very Very good game. Put a westcoast server in though. Got 108ms on this game but get 24-30ms on fortnite / csgo
13285,"Fucking useless game.
Garbage pairing system.
0% recommended.

You can't add other players, and can't report bugs and players.
Terrible game system."
13286,"This is a very well made game, it sometimes makes me rage but all in all its a good game and something you should try out"
13287,great game
13288,Best FPS out there by far equal game play for everyone love it keep up the good work.
13289,Awesome game!!! 😘👌
13290,Amazing Game!
13291,good
13292,"Black Squad is another F2P CS:GO Clone that tries to do its own thing, and in doing so completely ruins itself.

Black squad *used* to be good, weapons were balanced and nothing was inherently ""Pay to Win"", hoever, these days are long since gone.

Black Squad has now become the same bland repetitive shooter that every game before it, with the only real ""Tactic"" being grenade spam. You'll hear a grenade blow up every 1-2 seconds now, when before they were legitimately used tactically.

TL:DR - Black Squad tries to do too much with too little, and as such, just falls short."
13293,This game is absolutely awesome!
13294,I..... no.
13295,hello
13296,A really awsome game but i wist the match making was faster
13297,Map Awareness :<
13298,"Microtransactions only go up to $100!!! Gunplay is useless, just take out that knife and prepare for a good time! 2/10 add at least 2 more respawns."
13299,Good game
13300,VEH GUD
13301,"Fun game, but every time I get on it takes a few minutes to find a match. TDM is really the only thing being played. Takes a while to get in game currency for new guns. 

btw haven't really came across any hackers, not sure why so many complaints."
13302,This game feels like the worst of both worlds from csgo and cod. absolutly terrible.
13303,meh
13304,"Its a very good game, but since some days it keeps chrashing my entire pc like one minute after starting it.
i found at the internet, that the windows fullscreen optimisation is the reason for this. but even turning this off was not fixing it.

would be great, if anyone could help me out to fix it.
still a good game to play wit friends..."
13305,Best free Shooting game <3
13306,GOOD
13307,BEST GAME
13308,i most popular game i ever played
13309,"I'm very excited for this game,graphics look so good and physics are impressive.You don't need to spend money or many hours at the game in order to get good weopons the only thing that you have to do is to download the FREE DLC from the your steam library or go to search > Black Squad > All DLCs.
You can also get weapons from the steam community store price for permanent weopons and equipment  are very very low price 
The only disadvantage so far is the competitive I hope they will make it more balanced .Hope you will found this review useful, enjoy."
13310,DONT PLAY ITS GAY
13311,"This Game Is So Fun!It's Better Than CS:GO after my review is spend almost 200 Hours In This Game!It's one of my favourite and Good Luck To The Creators to make it better than now,and I realy wanna see a voice chat in Game!"
13312,this is a awesome FPS game and addictive

13319,no
13320,"dumpster fire of a game. cheaters are running rampant in the game and instead of banning them or trying to fix the problem, you ban big name players for no reason. the recent update where you cant trade or sell items on the market only serves to make it worse. what a huge scam, players have spent money buying skins and now they cant sell it off."
13321,"THe game isn't supporting linux mint!
would recomend for windows users!"
13322,nice
13323,dont even play this game. queue takes more time than the actual game.
13324,Great game for free

13336,"The only black thing in this game is the chat, everyone there talks like they came from some random hood. Not fun."

13344,"Unless you are looking for a game that occasionally gives rewarding game play, but is usually a frustrating hack-fest, avoid this one."

13353,SHIT HIBOX
13354,so bad -_-

13361,"Tons of cheater in this game , if you want to get cancer just play this shit."
13362,Black Squad is a amazing combination of FPS and Thrid Person Shooter.

13367,CSGO + COD = BlackSQuad
13368,It's a great free to play shooter honestly.
13369,qeqad
13370,"The Competitive Matchmaking Beta is so unbalanced, in eagle bracket you'll face a cobra and lion at the same time. SO UNBALANCED!!! Please do something about this. I am starting to hate this game"
13371,"Awesome game. Lots of game modes, lots of weapons and most of all lots of value for money. You don't need to spend a single dime on this if you don't want to.
The engine is great, runs on lower end hardware. The game is casual enough to jump in and have fun, but has a high enough skill cap to appeal to the so-called 'pros'.
If you like shooters, you need to try this out.
"
13372,"Pros: 
Early Access - Free to Play
No Pay 2 Play
Weapon customization is pretty nice and plentiful
Can buy weapons with in game funds that you make from matches
Some specialty skins and guns ones as well
Gameplay is balanced and fair
Gun mechanics aren't all that bad for an Early Access title

Cons:
Graphics are alright, but I know they can be better. It is still in Early Access
A little choppy even with good internet (not enough to not play and I streamed it)
Like all FPS online multiplayer games -- some lobbies will be completely empty or jsut 2 or 3 people, but it fills up eventually
You can tell it's an early access title
Head shots seem to be easier than body shots

Overall:
11 out of 5 - This game is good. REAL GOOD, I feel like it's trying to find a heavy team focus within itself, but for now the modes are chaotic and pretty fun. Teammwork is that person shooting right next to you at that time. Reminds me of Black Ops 2.
"
13373,"I really do love this game.
CS-GO with COD team death match. 
you can play competitively or like me just play to have a mass of fun.
there is no pay to win only pay to be different so all in all a soild 10/10 for me"
13374,I love this game.
13375,lit
13376,GG
13377,"Another f2p ""run and gun"" game...  not my thing."
13378,"i only played this game for 30 minutes to find that the maps are heavily 1 sided resulting in spawn camping. foot steps are so loud i could hear people in the next building. and in terms of cheaters they seem to use WH from what i could tell.
"
13379,this days all hacker join the game and plz see this and we love to play this game and now i can enter the game and i left diract 0000000 code
13380,Nice game!!! :)
13381,Horrible game compared to AAA games this game feeels like a early 2000s game.
13382,"BEST FREE TO PLAY FPS GAME
"
13383,"Too many foreigners. Netcode is good, but because there's majority foreigners, it is normal to see ping in the triple digits for these players. The game is pretty solid, however. I do see some slight grammar issues, but it's all fine and dandy"
13384,"I would not recommend this at all. I know this game is free to play and it's in its very early stages of development but it is just not worth playing. For $15 you can get the polished complete verision of the game called CS:GO becuase that is what the devs of black squad are going for. A disgusntingly poor game of CS:GO and COD cross over. I cant recommend it, and whats with the graphics? The game looks like it came straight out the 90's.
Graphics: Potato
Gameplay: Clunky and not user friendly
Quality: 1.2393298844/10 
Additional info: Hackers are lurking"
13385,Hi can you make more tourbament for SEA server please.
13386,"Simple arcade gameplay, 

With elements of CS:GO and call of duty. 
The defusal mode is probably the only mode you want to play. 
As all other modes are just children not knowing what arcade deathmatch means so naturally it's a major camp and spray fest. 
Fun and easy at first, but in due time it gets extremely boring and owning these below average players becomes dull. 

So would I recommend this game? 

If you're  fond of shooting easy targets while they're actually having the hardest time of their limes than this might be the game for you. 

And or if you're too poor to afford either cs:go or call of duty or oyu're just a terrible player in fps games ingeneral you'd fit right in. There are no rules anything goes, you can use whatever handicap you may like without criticism from the community. 
But do keep in mind there might be people out there just like me who are experienced players with actual skill we have no need for any of the handicaps and just simply rush and 1 tap you over and over and over, granted they are rare for most of these players just like me, are just sticking to regular good ol skillscene shooters like, Quake 3, Unreal Tournament instagib or competitive counter-strike. 

And if you're like me, 

Don't bother trying, sure pwning is fun but it gets old real quick. 
Try dirty bomb instead, a waaaaaay better game."
13387,"Well, I personally find it awesome. I didn't notice any negative aspects. This game is based on pure skills and I like it. Definitely worth attention!"
13388,"crispy graphics, interesting gameplay, challenging atmosphere… as for me, it was great experience. highly recommend to all fans of well done shooters..."
13389,I mean the game is okay I guess
13390,great game
13391,"How you make a rank match ?
Everygame The rank never be fair 
Have point for what ?"
13392,Black Squad a great f2p game with great graphics low requirements. its good fun to play and would definetly reccomend.
13393,I lke it
13394,"everytime i try to even load the game it just shows a white screen. i cant tell the game is running because the sound still works but all i get is the white screen
"
13395,"Never anyone to play with.  I've waited and waited for a group to form.  It's a time waster. 

 You have to have a certain level to do certain activities. Which slows other co ops down cause they have to wait on you to grind your ass into a proper level.  It's bs leveling up.  Just let me play the game."
13396,great game
13397,"Pretty fun game, wish they had a few better weapons and some better maps, the hackers i guess you have to live with. The are not invincible tey can die like other player. Just have to be more aware now than before.I was in military,so some of the play and actions come natrural,so it makes it easy. but a lot of players think they are cheating, no when you been a soldier, you come to learn there moves before they make them.In real life combat you dont make same mistakes, it will cost you your life.In the game its the same,except you die and respawn, in life your dead and buried. No respawn aloud."
13398,THIS GAME IS SO GOOD.
13399, A good free alternative to more expensive shooters
13400,"Piece of trash. Seriously. Dont even waste data and time on it. tons of campers, random accuracy mechanics and hitboxes. :)"
13401,My first FPS game in my life :) HAPPY geek
13402,a
13403,"I miss Combat Arms, and luckily Black Squad brings back those memories with even more complex mechanics and a solo competitive mode--not only solo, you can queue up with squads too. The netcode is definitely superior to Combat Arms, which is important in an FPS. And most importantly, you don't have to deal with so many hackers. I never encountered a hacker in all the time I played, though I will not be continuing because I have other games to pursue."
13404,One Of The Best FPS Shooter Out There. This Game Has So Much Potential To Become One Of The Best Games Of All Time
13405,GG
13406,Hi Black Squad Can I Have Some Cool Skin And BS Coin :D Im Just Kid....
13407,"real great game

13411,"Love this game, keep it up BLACKSQUAD <3"
13412,"kurva

13413,It all ends with not able to use a decent controller. So called die hard gamers think you should use a keyboard per se. But I think any developper should be able to make a game which can be played with a controller. It just sucks playing with mouse and keyboard. So a no go for me.
13414,"It's a great game for First person shooting. It's similar to Counter Strike Global offensive, i would reccomend playing this game it has some intresting features."
13415,so bad aim and graphics game of kids totaly

repetitive game play and free guns are usually boring and weak

only good thing is the grapchics

i can say this is the ret@rded brother of csgo"
13437,"Not recommend just for the worst User Interface i experience i had in a long time, literary had to alt+f4 could see exit and the clutter is so insane you dont even want to try and find it. At the time of this review i have 40mins but atmost 5-10 were in actual game, rest trying to figure whats what, thats how *^%% it seems.

GAMEPLAY seems solid. A cs rippoff with a twist, dont know if its worth to go through the ui pain tbh.

Sound and netcode seem good as weel."
13438,"well paced action-pack game, lots of fun"
13439,Did not like this game the settings were a pain the community was awful in my opinion this was like playing CS:GO minus the angry russians if you like it I'm happy for you but in my opinion I'm good

Reason: Can't even play the fucking game."
13449,"This is one of the best FPS I've played in a while. It's so satisifying and fun. It doesn't feel too difficult yet also doesn't feel too easy. It feels balanced. I only wish that you could play as a female for free, without having to buy anything, either with in game or real currency."

13487,"HI All!
I would recommend this game, but maybe in 3-5 years after you have received at least 500 LIVE players on their servers.
The game has a way of wrestling ""battle rooms"" ... more than the number of players.
Wait almost 300 seconds for a room to fill up and play a 5-10 minute game sucks for a long time.
Then comes the pay to earn the factor ... I can live with this, although the kids credit cards empty just to play a sh * t game.
Now I know why CS:GO is still on the top of FPS...still hate it because of cheaters."
13488,fix fix fix

13510,"After 1 year of playing Black Squad, here are my reviews: 

Pros:
1. Not p2w
2. Demolition is ok
3. Some skins are easily obtainable using medals / bs coins but its just skin no change in weapon stat

Cons: 
1. Lot of script/macro users
2. TDM map is good until they added some of the demolition maps into TDM which is a horrible decision
3. Fps still drop
4. Teleport even on low ping
5. Got some suspicious players especially the low rank/""newbie"" maybe due to their main account got ban by BE
6. Sabotage map in demolition needs to be improve. Hard to spot enemies when the background is almost the same color as the enemy's gear"
13511,"Nice game and really fun if you have a low spec pc. better than CS:GO tbh

13512,Solve problems FPS 10 FUCK
13513,game is buggy after last  update. pay to win not to bad . but seeing people getting kicked for cheating. Also way to many hacks even though they have anti cheating it seems the cheats have over come this anti cheating.

13527,best game
13528,nice game
13529,AWsome
13530,Thank you for making this game clean from hackers. Every game I saw a notification that a player has been kicked due to hack detection. Your anti cheat program really did the Job well. More power Black Squad team.
13531,I really love this game it is so fun to play and all the different gamemodes and weponds make it so much more entertaining I strongly suggest this game
13532,Basically CS:GO mobile. You have to buy a grenade every day and the UI will make you want to shoot yourself
13533,"I can not truly say that i recomend this game anymore due to the increase in hackers and aim bots. I have documented so many cases of hackers while recording gameplay footage for my YouTube channel. Their is also the map issues where enemies can easily spawn kill you. I have played this game for awhile now and all i can say is this. When i first downloaded this game it was an amazing game, but now its nothing more than a hackers and bots playing field with nothing but spawn killing."
13534,A good game. It's realy funn and exiting
13535,"I like this game a lot, and the fact that it's free just makes it even better"
13536,"The gameplay and graphics are all awesome and the community are pretty decent and the game developers are trying to satisfy the needs of gamer, for me the only problem is the match making in Competitive (beta II) 
But overall im giving it a 9/10 score 
P.S i havent meet any hacker which is good in FPS game which is usually a huge problem"
13537,One of the best Fps Game.. awesome Game mechanics..
13538,"Vast range of guns,Various game modes,Beautifully detailed maps,
BLACK SQUAD is a perfect online fps shooter"
13539,honestly if you are looking for an alternative for black ops or csgo this is great
13540,"Game UI is way to much like just way way to much... If you go and change any settings game automatically closes and have to start back up. Controls are kind of wompy.. So far not impressed, can't even get into a match or find players.."
13541,"This game is very problomatic already. Could not exit tutorial. Poor voice acting. Difficult and frustrating menu. Would not recommend.

Edit: Wow, I was 12 when I wrote this."
13542,"F2P but not P2W, best played with friends, actually pretty fun, killing people feels satisfactory.
It's free, give it a try."
13543,"Gun play: meh
Balance: shit
Net code: shit²
Game modes: meh expect arms race which is shit
Servers: shit"
13544,"I don't have that many hours on record but i've been playing a lot of different fps games like quake, RoTT, CS, CoD, BF, TF2 etc etc. since 2012 so i've got a lot of experience. 

For first a lot of noobs are reviewing the game. Just dont even read it. 
Secondly this is an EARLY ACCES dang it! It is obvious that it won't be perfect and bugs, glitches and unbalance will happen ( allthough i didn't ran into any bugs ;v)
Thirdly (sorry for rough expression) whining about pay-to-win content is a complete BS (and i don't mean Black Squad) because the company has to make money. 

OK lets get to the review then.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Black Squad is an FPS game that mash ups CoD and CS games. 
The game has pace of CS - faster running with a mele weapon and no sprint, 

Gunplay is pretty much a hybrid - you can aim down the sights, spraying a weapon does not make it fly to the moon but at the same time some weapons have big recoil so it balances the S&P stuff, also weapons always have a specific spread similar to that in CS:GO but actions like  jumping, crouching, moving dont really affect the spread and recoil 

Customization  - you cant really change your weapon attachments but they are already set with different attachs like grenade launchers, foregrips, sights etc. you can also change character, grenades, mele weapon, spray etc.

In game currency, unlocking - you have 4 different currencies; BS coins, Bullets, Gold and Medals. To get bullets you need to buy them for the real money, to get gold you need to play games, do daily missions etc. Medals are acquired from leveling and as daily mission rewards as well, Bs coins are obtainable by opening the cases with keys. You can also earn gold and medals in other ways but im not going to describe them now.

Performance - It is well optimised ,i think that if your computer is not from stone age then it should run the game at stable 60fps.  

So lets get to some PROS and CONS

PROS:
- The game requiers skill so weapons dont really play the whole role here
- Gold store is pretty cheap; it is easy to get bunch of weapons early
- Recoil and spread arent crazy high in every weapon to make one shot headshots only viable option to kill someone quickly; spread doesnt increase super drastically while moving and shooting at the same time
-You can play ""practice"" match - basically you are alone on the map and you can set bots as a static targets where ever you desire, also has clock and quickly changeable presets (loadouts) -  which is a great opportunity to check what weapon deals what damage at given range or body part; it is a great tool to choose the weapon that suit your needs best
-Good FPS
-Battle match is something new i like it for some of its features


CONS:
-Although the game requiers skill some of the weapons are unballanced so badly that they can give you an upper hand in some situations 
-Gold store is pretty cheap yes thats true but medal store isn't. Medal store gives you weapons for .... MEDALS! And they are obviously better. To make iot clear - it is much harder toi get medals in this game so you know.... buy this exp boost to get deagle earlier.
-When you jump recoil and spread dont change as well. Jumping wins most duels.
-To be honest SMG's and LMG's rule. Both at long at close quarters (especially LMG's at long) are just better because of their fire rate and power. And LMG's have biiiiig mags
-Matchmaking is extremely bad. noobies are mixed with veterans - no sense at all
-Female characters break immersion totally. They rather look like gamer girls with oversized breasts and anime like faces. Pink haired, big breasted girl in the middle of slaghter doesnt really fit.
-I wrote that battle match is a good thing but it also has some downsides. Even though you get classes, in game ranks taht allow you to gett better ""pointstreaks"" (for destroying objectives and killing players you get points, for those you can buy some killstreak like stuffs like claymore, grenade launcher, airstrike etc. they dont reset when you die) but overall its reeeeeally boring. Just go, shoot the wooden box that has anti blast anti bullet wood ( it takes A LOT of time to destroy one) boom and another one.
-Maps are soooooo lazy. Basically it i s always a mirror. you dont really have two different respawn areas and various routes; both teams start at the same looking place, and everything is basically copied. No Variety at all. To see what am i talking about just look at some pictures of those maps. Youll get what i mean.


It is hard to say how will the game look in the future. At the moment i wouldnt recommend playing the game if you are looking for something new in FPS genre and especially if you aren't patient or skilled in FPS games.



"
13545,"I really like Black Squad because it’s like any other ‘CS-GO’ type game. But this one you can play without having to purchase and products with real money. The downside is that it does not support controllers that I am aware of, which would make Black Squad amazing. All in all, for the price, or lack of, Black Squad is a great game and I recommend checking it out."
13546,Excelente!!
13547,"Update: to market sale Ban on steam - you fc*** ignore the personal right of the people to invest money in new items, and change them to offers? A new design is out and I sell old ones and buy new ones. this is my fc*** money and my right to sell my stuff. Pay 2 win is ok - if my money and items have a value.
Dictatorship is nothing compared to this....


ok, as many other Players have writen before... it was and could be, and may be will be a good (really) Shooter. I love the fast engine, remembering me on good old Unreal times. so ~400h play - I think I could say something to the Game and appraisal things writen here.
In the last weeks BattleEye nether catched a hacker in Rounds played by me. The number of hackers raised significant! It is no Fun anymore. Without a functioning Anti-Hacker System this Game dies - in unfortunate manner.
At this point also STEAM is in responsibility. All money at the End is filling there bank account, so fc**** help the developers with software against hackers, cheaters,... and also BAN these people from STEAM. In the last Years so many good Games died because of this problem.
Other things writen about BlackSquad:

- level design - YES, sometimes one side has more obstacles to hide and better sniper areas, AND also sometimes the Colours of both sides makes a difference, because the snow camouflage of the one side makes no sense on many maps and makes them to good victims only.
- AKA47 - Yes, there is something wrong with the weapon since beginning. It is no Fun if on some maps a team with many AKs but bad players dominat.
- SPAWN Points are rushed down so You have no chance to start without enemy fire.
- NO working balance in Player mixing - sometimes only Beginners have to compete to high level Players 
- NO working balance if players leave... 8 players vs. 4 I so often have seen, only frustrating...

- Grenade spawn - not so a problem. Only in some locations relevant
- COOP? I think there is a working Coop because there are enough Variations to play in a Team
- I love the great team battles of AIRBORN or the Team based Destruction Mods, only balancing is often not working good

I love the engine, Gameplay, weapons, competition, Money and Free to Play system, Textures quality a.s.o
Invested up to now in the SALES around 20EUR only for the developers, there was no NEED of playing with a weapon in special textures!

I will stopp playing UNTIL something happens against the stupid players in NEED of hacking because not able to compete in a fair competition...

________
was soll man sagen, mal wieder getestet und es wird einfach nur schlimmer, nach dem Verlassen des Early-Access wurde nicht mehr in die Entwicklung des Spieles investiert sondern nur ständig sinnlose Skins auf den Markt geworfen. Gegen Cheater, Hacker, Bots wurde rein garnichts unternommen"
13548,gaygun one shot all.. wow
13549,Best game +rep
13550,nice FPS game
13551,"Best Free-to-Play FPS on the market. With the free DLC's you get access to ingame coin and a free trial with most weapons so you can figure out what you like before you buy. There is nothing p2w about the game, only pay-2-have-cool-skins. I wish they had more modes. Reminds me a lot of COD. I wish they had a domination mode."
13552,great game
13553,It's as if COD and CS:GO had a love child. It's quick and fun but  sometimes you keep getting sniped across the map. You can leave spawn and you just want to leave.
13554,so much potential but game gets boring very fast
13555,Me like. . . Hope this was helpful :)
13556,Great game fast paced gameplay.
13557,"pros:
-fast pace
-good gunplay
-looks good and runs well overall
-gun variety
-rewarded for actually aiming and getting headshots

cons:
-grenadespam
-god awful map design (mostly)
-single shot sniper rifles are really unfun to play against 
-some scopes and controls are a little funky

i really like the game but the abundance of snipers and grenades ruin my experience personally
if i were to suggest changes to TDM only
-make all snipers require a headshot to oneshot kill and make autosnipers require one headshot and bodyshot at least to kill (exeption to the heavy anti-material rifle its fine as it is filling its role in)
-reduce overall ammo in reserve for snipers and increase the minimap reveal duration for firing one (exept for autosnipers)
-have the grenades recharge during the match rather then just refill completely on spawn or just diable them on TDM(right now its grenade hell 24-7)
-make a safezone in the spawn area that if you dont leave you won't lose spawn protection(this can be far back so it doesn't get abused literally last session 4 people sat behind where we spawn and wiped us completely again for free and they even managed to get away with it)
-add cover to a lot of maps, cover a lot of windows up(the majority of maps on TDM are literally just straight corridors getting sniperpeeked and spammed with grenades)
-(maybe) add slightly increased accuracy with suppressors on 
-make the laser sight useful (as far as im concerned the laser literally does nothing)
-maps other then cover need a rebalance as well, since sometimes the enemy team has the advantage on your side too (especially true for not symentric maps like te night time dockyard)
-""dropshotting"" is awful to play against and negates any stability problems a gun has making the AK type guns far too strong, so i would recommend adding a stability and/or accuracy drop if you duck while shooting
-DMRs should be on single fire IMO and have slightly higher damage"
13558,The game is fun but there are far too many cheaters in it. Every game I go into someone is cheating using a body hack to take no damage.

13584,"Really good game. If you played any FPS game before that you were actually decent at, you'll most likely enjoy Black Squad. Not Pay to Win at all, there's free DLCs that gives you a bunch of weapons for free for 2 weeks. After these 2 weeks you'll have to buy weapons with the currencies you'll get by playing the game. Oh and in the 170 hours I played this game, I didn't come across more than 5 hackers so don't listen to all these people that just keep crying saying this game is full of hackers.

I hope you'll enjoy this game as much as I do!

13596,great game ever
13597,"Aimbotters and cheaters galore, was fun when it was first out until everyone had to ruin the fun."
13598,"Great game. Love most of the maps and it has a decent collection of guns/melee stuff. Sabotage needs to get removed though. Worst map imaginable. Dust Shield needs to get removed from Demo. There should be a KDR limit to play demo, or at least a vote option to kick. Nobody wants a 2-10 on their team. Nobody.

Edit: This game is starting to get very unplayable. Competitive matchmaking is incredibly bad. Player base has dropped significantly. Market restrictions also made a lot of people quit. Instead of making it so you can detach the grenade launcher, you have to purchase an entirely new weapon, so you can't even use your own skins anymore. There is absolutely no advertising for this game and they just casually remove characters (girl with backpack, craig) for no reason. What possible benefit is there to content removal that people actually would like? All there really is at this point is skins. Waste of 1.2k hours."

13621,"Pros : Nice graphic, solid gameplay, big playerbase, totally not a p2w game like other online fps games
Cons : No microphone communication which is sucks when playing competitive

To sum up : It's a game where you will play after having a tough match in csgo/dota without worrying about dropping rank/mmr. The biggest problem which is no mic communication will constantly keep it below par with other online fps games"

Pros:
Game runs well (I guess)
Okay community

Cons:
Discord ""Devs"" are not actually devs and have no say so in the game.
Community Managers are ALLLLLLL asshats and tend to be toxic. (Besides Rocky and Orion) <3 you orion
No drive to push for any kind of tourneys.
Long que times
Not honest about current things in the community
Unjust bans (Rip 28 rip man you were banned wrongfully because you were to good)
No content updates (Most content is in the game from KR but will most likely be added behind paywall or never added)


MAJOR CONS 

Look at the publisher (NEOWIZ, NEOBRICKS) do 1 google search and know now why you shouldnt play this game.

Worst game i have ever partnered with would not suggest it heres some free keys tho

13636,"This is a great game for low end pc's that even higher end pc's can play as well, the gameplay is smooth and from my experience getting weapons is just a matter of grinding. The pay to play weapons actually aren't any different than the ones you grind for. In fact the most powerful sniper i've seen you have to grind for and the snipers you have to pay for are at the same power as one of the other two snipers you can buy. Needless to say the balance is there and starter weapons imo are as balanced as every other gun. Every weapon has it's purpose. For people interested in gun history this game has that too. All guns that i've seen have a description of where they were made and when they were put into service. Just remember this game is early access, so with that being said there is some lag on a match startup and a bit of lag in games once server pop picks up as the servers probably aren't that big...yet. Otherwise have fun, get those headshots, and game on."

13641,It is a very nice game 10/10 i reccomend this you should play this like counter-strike. have fun with this and good luck :D
13642,i like dis game alot dunno why  just do any how its a free fps its kinda like csgo but it isnt also u can run this game with a potatoe which im happy about cause my laptop is a potatoe made some cool friends and what not other than that a solid game tbh few glitches here and thier and the occiosnal hacker or wall seer pops up in a lobby at this point we kinda know from which clan they come from and what not but its pretty legit however this is a pure skill game true in order to unlock the good guns u need medals but u get that thru lvling up and i fu want the skins they cost bs coins or random boxes with irl money sooo oof (still after that sweet s15 western and black cyber) but yeh its fun play it not enough peeps in na clan matches any more we have to go to EU which sucks

i think quick match is good option .
i think you need to make better textures because they are looking like old games and doesnt match our correct time yes the models are good but i dont like the texture they have.
and the most annoying thing is you need to pay money to get ""good weapons"" even if they cheap its still annoying you need to pay money for how you look in the game or overpowered guns. 
hackers are everywhere and it's looks like you ok with it.
and if people think ""its looks like call of duty"" then let me tell you something
the game doesn't have the same mechanics that game doesn't have free crates you actually can earn something good from it and unlike call of duty you dont need to pay to get crates you play to get them and you can get the same things like you get in the paid one's and you dont have there 20x more chance or something and in short call of duty is not pay to win."

13666,Cool Free2Play game but these microtransactions suck and there is kinda Pay2Win with the weapons you can buy
13667,It is really Good. It's really addicting as well plus it has free DLC's. Who doesn't love that?
13668,"To be short and sweet, this game is an abover average F2P game. The only money you'll spend in game is to buy cosmetics. That's it. 

Now for the long version.
Lets start with the good.

-It's a cross between CSGO and CoD. Take it as you want, but to me that's a good thing

-It runs very well on low end PCs. I have a decent PC build so I wasn't worried about it, but a friend of mine played this game on his $400, 2 year old laptop and it worked fine and ran at 60 fps.

-Good players are rewarded for being good. This game doesn't cater to new players. You will get destroyed by veterans rather often. Doesn't sound fun until you get just as good as them and become that veteran player who feasts on new players.

-The Assassination game mode is by far the most game mode to me. It's not something I've seen in a shooter before. It's by far the best in terms of teamwork, strategy, map and gamemode knowledge, and overall shooting skills. I don't want to explain the whole game mode here, but it is by far the game mode I spent the most time on.

Now for the bad:

-Some guns are A LOT better than others. They need to be balanced a bit better

-Not as much variety in maps or guns as I like. I get its a free to play game, but using the same guns and playing on the same maps gets boring after a while

-The player base is somewhat small. If you join an assassination game or melee/sniper only lobby you'll run into the same people ALOT. I played with and against so many of the same people playing assassination that it was annoying (it can be also a good thing, but I really only remember the players who were better than me so it hurt me when I saw them on the enemy team)

-There are hackers. Now, I've read other reviews and they act like they are in every game. They aren't. Maybe they just got unlucky. About 5% of lobbies have a hacker. 5% is a rather large number when we're talking about hackers, don't get me wrong, but it's not as blown out of proportion as others are saying. Just report the hacker when you see them, leave the game, and stagger the que (or play a different mode). 

Overall, it's a great F2P game, and if you're on a budget on a low end PC, this game is definitely for you"
13669,"Bomberman Squad!!!

becuz everygame grenade bomb you back to the stone age!!!"
13670,"It's really a good game to play, the game is like CoD and CSGO mashed together in one awesome game, thumbs up to the developers of this game. It's free and amazing."
13671,....
13672,"its sucks
"
13673,"Please read all of what I have to say before making any assumptions

The game itself feels fantastic escpecially for being free, even though I can't even start a queue for a match most of the time however there are a lot of bugs and issues that make the quality of life of this game horrible, even when starting it up there's a 50/50 chance it will only open up to a blank, white screen with only the audio working correctly and even though I haven't played much, every so often, even if I'm on the homescreen it will randomly say I've been disconected and kicked from the game entirely, however the bits and pieces I've give it a lot of promise and I hope I can play smoothly in the future"
13674,"Black Squad waifus are of a reasonable quality. If they brought the price of the premium ones down to 99p I would totally buy one. So close, and yet so far.

I would like the ability to browse the shop while waiting for a match."
13675,I Installed it with great anticipation and got disappointment in 3 seconds after loading the game. I mean we even had better fps games in year 2010 but this is like they are not even trying. Considering the game is in alpha i have a suggestion for the devs. Scrap this project and start a whole new one with more dedication. Ive seen much more games were developed with less funds and advertisement but gone so well. I don't recommend this game to anybody. Better play zula online instead. Even that has better gameplay dynamics and graphics although its a ripoff game.
13676,the best game for free in steam -_-
13677,"I really like this game, great game mechanics, nice maps, lots of options to play around with. New maps and characters options has been added. Also the stability is very good lately.
With that being said, this game simply sucks due to massive ammount of players using aimbots or third party programs sych as aim hacks, wall hacks, speed hacks, etc. 
Most of my friends and myself included already quited playing this game since developers wont take any actions to stop those players. After all it's all about money. Nobody will ban someone who pays for the game right?
Great game, bad developers, bad comunity. Good luck further along!!"

On only a few small occassion have I ever felt that someone was TRULY hacking (I have been accused of hacking several times because noobs camp the SAME spot every time id kill them and they would return right back there -.-).............. There are a good variety of guns, each with different capabilities (distance, power, etc). Some boxes and walls CAN be shot through (saw one review calling that a bug -.-) and YES, you can even in real fucking life get shot through a flag (that review was talking about getting sniped through hanging banners in one map)

13698,"[h1]TL;DR: I check what's going on in the free-to-play section of Steam from time to time and Black Squad was always there in the popular tab. I was looking for a F2P COD-like, brainless FPS for a while now, and Black Squad seemed to fit the bill perfectly. F2P, not pay to win, with good map design and frequent updates. I'm a 10+ years veteran of CS 1.6 and CS:GO to a lesser extent, just to give some context to my review and why I think that, despite being a legitimately good and fun game, it also has some really annoying flaws that may make me leave. [/h1]

[b]Let's start with the basics and the positives:[/b]

- The time-to-kill is pretty short, something between COD4 Normal and Hardcore mode. It's a free-to-play Korean game running on the Unreal Engine 3, so it has microtransaction and some weird skins like Katanas for knives, or waifus for player models. I suppose most of the “anime” style stuff has been removed for the western release, but the Asian roots still shows. 
There are three currency, two of which are earned by playing, one being given for any single match or daily login, the other by leveling up. It's probably the most fair F2P I've seen in that regard along with Warframe. There's even a pack of free DLC's you can get during early-access, which gives you both permanent and timed weapons – because yeah, the game has timed items. I'll get into this in the negatives, but to be fair they give you enough money to buy some permanent weapons straight away and the timed weapons from the DLCs lets you try them first. The number of weapon on offer is really extensive too. No weapon customization though, weapons have attachments from the get go, ranging from various optics to grenade launchers.

- It runs really well even maxed out, has an extensive settings customization including FOV, framerate limit, crosshair style and size. I can hit 120FPS on a R5 1600X @ 4Ghz paired with a GTX1060 6Gb EXOC with Fast Sync enabled and I get minor frame-drop in heavy scenes (~10 to 20FPS) but no tearing thanks to Fast Sync and input lag isn't noticeable. Just disabling the Ambient Occlusion gives me a locked 120FPS experience but hey, I like some eye candy – because it also looks pretty good! 

- The gameplay is just like pre-BO2 CoD. No slides, no jetpack, no BS. There are multiple games modes, all of which are classics and expected (TDM, Bomb Diffuse, Point capture...). There is a perk system, which is probably the best I've ever seen. While in a match, after a kill of two you get points that allows you to choose one of four classes, all of which have 4 abilities. You can activate them by spending points that you earn by playing the objectives, or frags. Which means that you can't use your abilities all the time, and that you'll have to earn them which is great. Also, you can activate a laser-sight that lets your teammates know where you're aiming and attach a suppressor which makes you invisible on the mini-map when shooting, but reduces your firepower a bit, regardless of your class. Those can be removed and attached again at will, but not every weapons have them. This is a great system. 
Unlike CoD however, you cannot go prone nor walk, but crouching removes any footstep sound. You can't throw back grenades, and the sprint key also switches to your melee weapon. 

- Maps are extremely well designed and look very good for the most part. I actually prefer those maps than CoD's 4 ones. Of course there's the mandatory map on a small yacht, which sucks, but the rest is awesome. 

- The netcode is stable, clean and fair. There are some cheaters of course, like in any game, but not that much. There's always a steady playerbase, at least for the moment. 

[b]Now let's talk about the negatives...[/b]

- First, I really don't like the fact that you have so many weapons but only three loadouts. Second, and this is my main grudge with the game, the way weapons attachments is handled sucks. Some weapons are completely unbalanced because of this (AK47GL...) and you don't have any way to know if the optic that comes with your weapons will fit your playstyle. Timed weapons is really annoying too, especially since you can't buy grenades permanently. Personally, that doesn't create player engagement, it makes me think twice about really getting into this game in a serious manner. 

- There's a real problem with the female “anime” player models. Their outfits have some shiny color highlights, but they're mostly white so in most maps they have a clear-cut advantage over regular player model because they blend in with the environment. It just looks stupid, too.

- No “Hardcore”, “no HUD” mode. Just why? The maps would really shine with that kind of mode! 

- Binding the sprint and melee together.

[b]Now, this is what I'd like to see implemented, otherwise I'll probably won't stick with it much longer:[/b]

- Removal of “anime” style player models. Female models is a cool thing, but make them wear the same gear than other player models, for the sake of balancing.

- Proper weapon customization and permanent buy of grenades. I have bought some weapons I don't use because their sight is not my style, and I love weapon customization in games like Insurgency. Just being able to choose if you want an optic sight or iron sight AND the actual crosshair when aiming down sights would be enough, but more in-depth customization wouldn't hurt at all. It would allow more tactical options too. 

- Being able to sprint WITHOUT drawing the melee weapon. Having both options would be cool, because my main issue here is that if I equip my Primary then sprint, when I'll press the “Last weapon used” key I'll switch to my knife and not my Secondary which got me killed A LOT. I have a 5 buttons mouse, and tried different combinations of key bindings but it's still a shore. 

- Allowing more loadouts. 4 or 5 would be just fine. 

[b]If those issues are addressed, I think I'll stick with it for a long time and may even spend some money on it. It's a good game really, but those issues I mentioned are just frustrating and limit the potential of the game in my opinion. [/b]"
13699,this game is very addicting but sometimes dosnt load
13700,"You're better off playing CoD sine the devs dont know what the f*ck balancing is and this game is just filled with campers. This game has degraded so much 
Wouldn't recommend even if the devs gain braincells

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake.He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. it was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me don't ever smoke. Please don´t put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.I agreed. At 20. i have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway"

13721,I`m really still impressed! This VR shooter differs from the most actions on Steam and maybe that is why I like it so much. Recommended!

Thanks for a great game been here since the release 

Thanks

13752,"Fun if you intend on just casually playing and not worrying about getting better gear.

Have enough credits through playing that you can buy a loot box? Awesome! Buy away. Don't expect to the game to give you the loot boxes containing the loot boxes that have the actual permanent items. Get that loot box from the loot box? Don't expect to be able to open it. Yep, Have to buy keys to open the loot boxes you just got through the loot boxes you just got through playing.

Absolutely ridiculous and completely absurd."

13777,"10 out of 10
"
13778,First when i Saw this game i didnt felt like it would interest me. But when i first tried it i started liking it it felt like cs:go a call of duty hybrid And i enjoyed that combination. I suggest it to you.
13779,"TL;DR at the end, but read entire review if you can

Okay, so first I'll adress the obvious. If you've seen this dreadful review section, then you'd have probably already guessed that the community is pretty ****. Each match I meet people who are more toxic than in any other game I played before, and when I one time said that I never played csgo (To excuse the fact that im pretty bad at this game) they became even more toxic towards me. Absolutely ugly playerbase, and probably always will be like that. Still, the game is fun. There are enough game modes to keep things fresh, and I will definetly be playing this game in the future. The netcode is good, and the amount of bugs is small. However... The guns need balance. Seriously. I can't say that the game is pay to win, because you can unlock each gun for currency you get in game, and in fact you get it pretty fast so no grind either, but goddamm is there no balance. There is ALWAYS a gun better than another. Yes, straight up BETTER. That is pretty bad, and the devs definetly need to work on that. There are lootboxes, but as far as I understand they only drop cosmetics for already existent guns (I opened one that I got for free at the beginning) so it's not a big deal. The playerbase is REALLY active. According to steamcharts it has around 6k average active players EVERY month since its release. That is not bad for a f2p game. Not bad at all. Overall, I highly recommend this game. The issues are just too small for me to say ""this isn't worth it"" because the game is free. If you have any time then definitely try this out.

TL;DR:
pros: 
Many maps
Many guns
Many game modes
No pay to win
Little bugs
Good netcode
Active playerbase
Free weapon packs can often be found in the steam store

cons:
Some guns are unbalanced
Really toxic playerbase
Lootboxes (Even if not game-breaking)

Overall, this is a solid game that I will 100% be playing more of, it has a lot of good things going for it, however the toxic players and unbalanced weapons really hurt the score of this game. This is a 7/10.

If I discover more issues or mechanics I will edit this review and share it with you.

13780,i like it ♥♥
13781,"Alright,tbh I've gotta change this review simply because im enjoying it now,the skins are good and not expensive too :DD but main thing is they nerfed grenade launchers and cheating is really not that rampant anymore but more often in cobra for example"

13788,i do adore this game af
13789,This game is great but feels like a popular filipino game called Point blank Try it out you see the similarities but i recommend this game has a good graphics and less cancer kiddies point blank has alot of them
13790,great shooting mechanics and no P2W
13791,Can I play comp with friends? If so how?
13792,Use shotguns
13793,"In theory it is a cool game for being free but overall it is pretty lame, incredibly easy to spawn trap people as well. Mechanics are pretty wack and the weapons suck."
13794,"Fucked my Pc up, had to restart it twice for it to even function properly, this game is not optimized for wide screen gaming at all, just a plain white screen, don't bother downloading if you have a wide - screen monitor."

13803,It WAS a great game until the DEV's has shown nothing other than greed for cash. 3 updates and still no fix to the random FPS drops but they sure as hell know how to update the box system.
13804,"It's simply a good game.
It is free and no pay to win tactics.
The more you play, the more things you'll unlock (besdies rare skins).
The team also adds new maps and guns so you can tell they care about this game."

good time waster but i dont see myself bringing my group into it."
13814,pretty gppd. tons of players and good maps. gameplay is smooth.
13815,its like cs go but more fluid and fun
13816,"I usually am pretty bad at fps games, but with this game that was not the case. It's both bad and good, i could be in top 3 if not at first place in every single match and it gets really Stale when There's no challange. However the game is fun in small Bursts. I just wished that some of the guns had little more depth to them like recoil etc.
I have not played Csgo and people tend to compare this game to that. This game reminds me of the old soldiers of Fortunes games.

The good: good maps
                  Decent graphics
                   Free to play
                   Fast november
                   Old school feeling

The bad: machineguns feels like Crap
                Bad progression system 
                Too easy 
                Very little depth to weapons

After a few MORE minutes of still no game play i restarted the lobby if you will and it started right up.  However, in the 2 hours or so i've had this game running that one game is literally the only game i have played.  I just sit in the lobby as the player count goes past 150 and a cute little side note on the bottom of the lobby saying ""will start game as soon as enough players are found...""  Is anyone else having the same issues?

13866,nice game its fun if you have discord

13876,its is a realy good game but you should remove the grenades and/or nerf them because u can manage to get 3 per player a game and up to 15 a team and every grenade deals to many damage they can all 1 tap you.

I can easly go in WarFace and have a better time playing that game. Just my two cents. I do not enjoy this game. The guns are akward to use.
13880,"I thought it was pretty bland to be honest, and the store prices were pretty over the top with 15$ to change character models. I only played for an hour, but the game doesn't compel me to keep trying it either..!"

chat: if you dont like it why do you play it..        F*G
me : ehhh.... ok? 

Prob has some quality shooter wise, but the nade spam clouds it. 
Just because its free doesnt mean you should design maps to be so nade spammable, can basicly nade the other people from your spawn.

Quickest turn off ive ever experienced."
13888,The game is very good and most weapons are pretty balanced. what breaks this game is the shitty map design. Its downright appaling

- Good graphics
- Non pay2win
- Balanced weapons
- Easy to learn hard to master

CONS:
- Noobtube (Spam grenade and grenade launcher)

Overall: I liked this game!
"
13890,Awfull
13891,cs go rip off
13892,"I didn't expect much from this at the beginning but it reminded me of my days playing CrossFire from z8games.
It has the CS:GO vibes, except with ADS but the run and gun TDM and Objective game modes really bring a fun ever lasting experience. Also the weapons... HNNNNNGGGG I love'em!"
13893,Won't even start
13894,Best fps game everrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!
13895,It's a good exception to COD it's a very arcade like FPS and is very easy to run
13896,"Black Squad is a game that has some identity issues.

The gunplay itself is nice. Weapons don't feel awkward at all and shooting other players feels very well done. The maps are alright, except for some maps that shot themselves in the foot with their maze-tier hogwash.

Then it's all downhill from there on out.

The menu UI is complete and utter garbage. I don't know how you can even accomplish this War-Thunder like eye-mistreatment of a menu, holy crap. There's so little whitespace I actually had to pause, look at the screen for an actual 5 minutes to process what I looking at, then another 5 minutes of trying to figure out where each of the 15 different buttons would get me (yes, I counted).
Mind you menu transitions are not seamless, takes about 2-3 seconds to load, which is very annoying to get around.

Whatever though, the gameplay is what matters.

Well if you can even get into a game that is. 

After literally 20 minutes, we and my mates finally got into a lobby. Turns out if you are in the shop menu, you won't be notified of invites. Cool beans yo.

After getting our settings done, it was pretty much a steamdump from there on out. Weapons are accurate and punishing, so most of it boils down your aim. Sure helps when your squad is a bunch of globals and supremes from Counter Strike. We absolutely blasted players for consecutive matches, many with hundreds of hours in-game, with very little issue. Being called hackers and smurfs by turks along the way (yes, there are people who think smurfing in casual is a thing). Indeed, pure skill will take you pretty far.

Other than the COD4 nuclear cross-map grenades and female bimbos running around (muh immersion), it wasn't that bad.

For a while it was fun. After a while though, we were so done. There were a bunch of consistent issues that kept popping up, which eventually made us quit. 

While the game apparently boasts great netcode, the netcode is not great. We're talking solid half to a full second behind a wall, and still getting shot as if you were in the open. Low pings of 50-70.

Sound-wise, we're talking people who literally jog right next to you make no sound at all. The amount of times I've been gibbed by some W-holding mouthbreather is insane. There certainly was no shortage of these kinds of players, in fact, I'd argue that they're in the majority. 

Relying on visual information alone makes the positional awareness of players terrible. There were times we were actually outplayed due to the fact that you cannot hear enemies that well. They've implemented things like walking and sprinting, but that's a useless mechanic if it doesn't do anything. It tries to appeal to the sound-whoring aspect of competetive games, but it doesn't want to do that, but it wants to

Keep it simple, stupid. Either do or don't, don't try to implement something you don't even know what is, or why you would want it.

Like, people literally sprinted on the edges of the map to flank the other team, and guess what, they were fine. No punishments what so ever, because you could barely hear it after all. This is the meta by the way. Literally just run around holding W and shoot whatever is in front of you. Speaking of sound, guns fired a couple of units in front of you sound distant. The localization is just as bad. Sound is very important, so this was a major issue.

Overall, I was left with a bad impression. A couple of hours, and I've found most of the game's fundemental issues. I'm no developer, but this is some seriously low-hanging fruit. Even an early access F2P is no excuse for this butchering of a shooter."
13897,Probably best FPS games out there rn.
13898,"it's just cod but ""free"". hackers, wack maps, etc."
13899,BOK GİBİ
13900,GG Pay to Win!!!! I just stopped playing😁
13901,Massively simplistic game made for low end pcs. If you want a shooter worth playing then pick up warface. This ones a waste of time.
13902,"This game is a lot of fun. It is a great time waster, with half decent graphics"
13903,not bad.
13904,good for being free
13905,gonna have to give a thumbs down for this as being an australian player i cant play online. LIKE AT ALL. the best ping ive seen on any server so far has been 312ms from east asia and theres nothing for australians. add a few more servers and it might be a thumbs up
13906,Awesome Game Better Than CSGO Everyone Should Try it Atleast Once
13907,"Might be good but I'll never know.

I won't play a game with 100+ping for US-West, especially considering I get 28 in every other game I own <3"
13908,"11/10 very good game. 

"
13909,"I love the game! It's not pay to win or anything like that. I've heard people say it is but that is because, you dont get how much you grind to get good stuff. I mean sure you can buy weapons but you dont need to because, if you are a deticated gamer you know that games take grind. Some little, but some alot. So to all those people who say this game is pay to win, Become dedicated to the game and you will see it isnt pay to win."
13910,Nice quick & action packed fps
13911,"cant play, cant invite friends, 10/10"
13912,"Very decent F2P game. I enjoyed it for a while although the slow-phased game play got me tired after a while. The good thing about black squad is that they keep it simple, and the maps are good for rushers aswell as campers.
Also its pretty optimized."
13913,"20:24:09: Starting BattlEye Service...

20:24:12: Launching game...
20:24:33: Note: File blocks can be ignored if they don't cause problems with the game.
20:24:33: [INFO] Blocked loading of file: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\QuickTime\Plugins\npqtplugin.dll""

Nothing helps, game does not launch."
13914,The bullet speed is too slow also fix the bullet detection. Its a great game but needs more improvements :)
13915,"A really fun game to play if you don't feel like or don't have the money for CS:GO, Rainbow Six: Siege or similar games that cost or just wanna find some game to chill, casual more and all. Feels like CoD and stuff. Easy to play."
13916,Looks like Insurgency - Call of Duty. Its cool tho.
13917,"Very nice counter strike clone! The only thing I don't like is random team mixing. I think developers should split somehow lobbies with new players and pro players. Sometimes it's completely impossible to kill someone because top gamers killing you in 1st second after respawn with headshot, while you not even noticed him. All the rest is good."
13918,I've been playing this game since november...and it's a enjoyable game tbh!....my friends reccomended this game to just play for time waste...but when eventually...I started playing it seriously...the guns are balanced...the maps are decent...the gameplay is decent...I will totally reccomend to try this game out if you're looking for a good free fps game.
13919,Better than mosto of payed FPS games I've played
13920,best game except for fortnite
13921,nice game
13922,lol meme game meme albert youtube flamingo butt
13923,Amazing try it out likes cs-go but more call of duty to it
13924,"Poor man's call of duty on UE3 in a nutshell. Lootboxes, classes and no recoil, although mostly everything is free apart from cosmetics, so that's pretty neat i guess. It could be fun to waste time with but it's a bit too bland for my taste tho."
13925,good cod rip off <3
13926,yeah
13927,"Amazing graphics, nice gameplay, great experience for killing time."
13928,[h1] meh. [/h1]
13929,Good game :)
13930,"ITS COOL!!!!
"
13931,"Honeslty,this game is fun 
but its getting boring they need to do some major update 
new modes
new weapons
and the keys is very expensive and when you open boxes it gives you duplicates i hate that why why why is that in the game just give duplicates ................if you already get all the contents of that box
anyways its been fun but its getting boring  ill be back if theres an update good bye
And im not having that much fun anymore its too basic 
But CROSSFIRE is a fun game so maney modes weapons characters and much much more"
13932,dont play this shit game. dont waste your time
13933,whenever i go to open the game i hear the intro but get stuck on a white screen. this screen is hard to close as i ned to open something using keyboared controlls. I havent even got to try the game due to this
13934,"Honestly one of the better FPS, Out of all FPS ive played (CSGO,Combat Arms, Warface, Etc) (not AAA games) this has to be the most balanced one ive played. Out of all the matches ive played, Ive never seen one Favorite weapon in the game I.E Ak47,p90,awp for CSGO and CQB series in Combat arms. I wish there was a west coast server but the lag isnt that bad still. Worst hack ive seen is teleporting in Melee survival matches, and even they suck at that. Weapons are really just ""choose until you find your weapon"" style gameplay. AK series is still dangerous to go against but atleast you have a chance now. Oh and the best part, SGs DONT 1 SHOT FROM HALF THE MAP OR CAUSE 1 SHOT DEATH ANYWHERE ON THE BODY. If your a FPS type who likes to aim, rush, or move tactically, This game is ideal for you. The only issue I have with this game is Quickmatch can either give you a well fought match (Tdms ending in 147 : 150 with 150 being max) or it can Fuck you up in the ass with High ranked players on the enemy team while you get 3 or 4 rookies, or you can just be in a team of pro players. *HEADS UP* Custom matches are for the skillful of the skillful, dont expect rookies here. Just deal with the quick matches until you get used to the game.

And a tip for the melee players, in Survival if your a 1v1er wait at start and let the groupers attack each other then you can easily kill of the rest of the groupers for a nice 1v1 (PATIENCE IS KEY DONT RUSH ATTACK, THE GAME'S HITBOXES ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE WHEN IT COMES TO MELEE KILLS)"
13935,"Not a hard game to get into if you have played Counter Strike Global Offensive or Call of Duty before. This game is like most first person shooters, except its free. :P (Yes there are cheaters in this game from what I've heard, but I never met one in game yet)"
13936,"The best game I have ever played. Love it
A lot of thinking required besides skill."
13937,Hackers everywhere... i only played 3 games and it was enough to see obvious cheaters.
13938,"Fun game to play. If you like counterstrike or call of duty then you should love it. There are some pay-to-win mechanics, but they are not massive game-changers. Loot boxes are present, but it's actually pretty easy to get any weapons that you want."
13939,Great game love it :)
13940,"overall a great game and the grapic is good and gameplay is amazing however their is some issue with the game , when i started to play the game , i went to plau a match, as soon as i join i reliazd their rank is much higher then mine ,making them way better then me so i dont really have a lot of chance i just hope u guys make this fair so i can enjoy this game more thank you"
13941,"Game suck. Have many cheters and Dont know what a ballance is. And i hope that every campers and a @Neat sniper user go outside and jump too car weels. And Devs 
Go to hell  or too wear you come. You f@ck up game a lot ^thx for loot boox and all you do in your every small ,mizery, garbage update you do."
13942,interesting
13943,"I MEAN I SHOULDNT EVEN BE WRITING A REVIEW CONSIDERING THE FACT I HAVENT PLAYED IT AND THATS ONLY BECAUSE THE GAME WOULDNT LET ME PLAY IT JUST APPEARED WITH A WHITE SCREEN THEN SOMETIMES IT WOULD TURN BACK ON AND I ""COULD PLAY"" BUT WHEN I START UP THE TUTORIAL IT GOES WHITE I CAN HEAR THE SOUND BUT THE VISUAL GAMEPLAY IS GONE *FIX THIS NOW I CANT EVEN PLAY A GAME I SPENT AGES DOWNLOADING* PATHETIC"
13944,"its an awsm game.cant express 
graphics are insane
gameplay is insane
support is insane
servers are insane

Hence,THIS GAME IS INSANE"
13945,"really need australian servers, love the game but can't play at 200+ ping"
13946,"i wish there was controller support

13947,"VERY NICE. GIVE ME BALISONG KNIFE. PLEASE. {""}"

[h1]EDIT:[/h1]
[b]To sum it up:[/b]
Sh!t Servers: Jitters, your character and other teleport a few steps and this happens at least 5 to 10 times in EVERY MATCH.

[b]Hackers Everywhere:[/b] Once in a while you'll see the good work that battle eye is doing, in game it kicks out the hackers and its ever so often. Can't blame the devs on this one but 1 in 3 matches you will come across a shady character or two who misses the ban hammer.

[b]Maps are Sh!t:[/b] Its really sh!t, from TDM to Demolition. Its hopeless.

[b]Advice:[/b] Save a little money and buy CSGO
**********************************************************************************************************

The Devs obviously don't give a f!ck about player experience. Hackers are abundant and the servers are laggy AF despite me having a constant 50ms latency.
They talk about having the best netcode, well its sh!t

[b]Sh^tty netcode:[/b]

Any game mode other than TDM and you're screwed. You're basically stuck in between a HvH scenario, wall hackers use their 1shot-kill snipers and own you.
If you've been around for a year like I have(since the games' been released) you'd see the gradual changes in gameplay as hackers get into the game.

And on top of that, the maps are just piles of sh!t put together, they are in no way as good as CSGO or even their community maps.
BS maps are like this, you have a maximum of 3 ways to leave spawn point, they extend to the middle. Thats it. The other side is just a copy of that and flipped. Certain maps like Harbor Noon and Dock night are so SH!T....its hard to describe it further when its just sh!t, you'll begin to hate those maps when you play them."
13949,"I used to play a the same type of environment game with little differences called Black shot, it is on the steam but its laggy becuase it does not support US yet since I tried that game but other than that Im loving this game so far <3"
13950,pretty baller indeed
13951,good
13952,its good game but some of the maps need to be redesigned
13953,great game
13954,Really great game is fun and its free it is similar to csgo....
13955,this game deserves better!
13956,"Very fun game to play, fast paced. The only issue lacking is the fact that you cannot ""trade"" kills. I seldomly will snipe someone just a split second slower than they have sniped me, I will see them flinch from the shot that I have taken, however they take no damage. Paradrop mode, is cool and fun and all, but the protection ends mid air for people who shoot before landing, leading them to be vulnerable before they even touch the ground. Ofcouse I am the little twat that snipes people in mid air before they even touch down, and I'm not really complaining about that one, just wanted to point it out. Regardless, for a f2p game, it feels well balanced and very fun to play."
13957,Ohohoho
13958,"it is a good game and it is like csgo and black ops had a nice romantic date and they both went home together while taking big hits of crack and they both got addicted to the crack and they had a baby, but that baby was on crack too due to the big dose her mother took. Then CSGO the, father, abonded them. The mom is left with this crack head deformed baby."

13960,"You won't find a match in any mode other than quick-play, and assault rifles are for noobs. Skins mean you're rich and probably that you're good at the game. 9/11 would die to a good looking sniper again."
13961,I would've played the game but it does not have controller gamepad support and that's how I play. It looks like a terrific game. I have an xbox one controller plugged into usb 3.0.
13962,good game i enjoy it
13963,"Black squad is a great game with or without friends, but it's matchmaking system is poorly done. sometimes you will be matched against a good player and you will get owned by them, then you're teammates starts  talking trash about you. I hope this game will be serious about the toxicity of other players. And btw i love this game it's just the toxic players and the matchmaking that pulls me away from this game. I play great fps like R6 siege, Insurgency and Pubg, and i think you can be one of my favorite game."
13964,Great Game. Too much for a free game. Damn.
13965,"I think this game is the best free to play game and it's not ""pay to win"" 
"
13966,It is a really good Call Of Duty (A.K.A) COD first person shooter game that is realistic.what is bad is that the credits are hard to get except for gold.
13967,"Black Squad is a fun game. It has good graphics and smooth and fast paced gunplay. The game is very fast paced too. There's not much wrong with it. 

There are a couple of problems I have with it. The game has a small amount of modes, and other than TDM, none of them are very unique or fleshed out. The maps are also a bit of a mixed bag. None of them are exactly bad, but some of them can feel a bit onesided, in that depending on what side you spawn on, you can have more of an advantage sometimes. It's not a great advantage and you can easily still win a match even when spawning on the worse side.

In all, I'd recommend it and think it's very enjoyable. It only needs a little more work and I think it'll be a game that can compete with some of the bigger titles out there, like Counter Strike."
13968,"I may only have 14 hours in (as of writing this) this game but so far im loving it. easy to pick up and play. The community is fairly nice. I had a match where myself and a guy on the other team kept running into each other and duking it out, and at the end of the match, since we kept talking during the match, we wound up becoming friends and play together often. I love finding good people to play with whether they are on your team or not, it makes the game that much better. Of course there are the ones who like to say your cheating when your kicking their a**. But thats just what you get with any online game when your better than someone, there is bound to be at least one person who wants to report you for being better than them. lol"
13969,I BUY ONE CARACTER SKIN LONG DAY AGO. AND WHEN I COME IN GAME I SAW MY CARACTER SKIN IS VANISH AND ALSO BS COIN... HOW POSSIBLE THIS?
13970,the game is ok but when you wait for the match you dont have many options and just stay watch 5min and then strat you can open medal shop menu / shop menu / settings / clan / STATISTIC and many more cause view profile is not enough
13971,The best free fps I have ever played. I abosolutely love this game. 10/10. Five stars. 100%.
13972,Very tactical game.
13973,"Pretty solid first-person shooter.
The weapons are nicely balanced and there are enough weapons to choose from.
Although this game has in-game lootboxes and in-game purchases, most are cosmetic and
are not limiting your gameplay experience.
In-game currencies are gathered at a decend pace.

Would recommend (7/10)"
13974,Game con cặc gì lỗi 0x000000 hoài cái địt mẹ nhà mày ah
13975,i'm addicted to this game you must find a solution for the disconnection of servers pleaseeee
13976,"P2win, sights cover 50% of the screen"
13977,Let's go boy!!!
13978,"Been playing for 3 days, spent no more than 2 hours on it. I was expecting to be killed left right and centre but I'm actually doing pretty well. Got a triple kill with one grenade, that was sweet. The game is fun. Simple, but fun. Also a good alternative for people who can't afford CSGO. It's free and takes up little storage so even if down the track I get bored, no harm done."
13979,"This game's main competitive game mode is 5v5 demolition, like in CS:GO.
I prefer this game over CS:GO because of the following reasons:

Less toxicity:
- No team killing (it is not possible to damage teammates)
- Very few cheaters (cheating in an unknown (or less popular) game isn't that much fun, I guess)
- No in-game voice chat (but you can give commands)
- You can disable the enemy team's text chat by pressing a single button
- You can do the same with your team's chat with a different button

Gameplay:
- More complex and more interesting maps
- More maps in general
- No map selection, so you have to learn all the maps (no dust2 only players)
- No round start buy (more balance, less tactics, less affected by stupid teammates)
- No side specific weapons (more balance)

Technology:
- Very moderate system requirements, you can play it on a low-end PC
- Good netcode, good hitboxes and hit registration, good lag compensation
- Better weapon animations (you can even see the ammo depleting from the P90)
- If you alt-tab out the game while waiting for a match, when it finds one, it will automatically go back fullscreen to the game

Other:
- More clear, more transparent and more fair ranking system
- You can find a competitive match in seconds at almost any time (in Europe)
- You can select a female as your character (4 kind)
- It is free, no pay to win (as promised)

In overall, this game is a better choice over CS:GO in case if you mostly play alone or with a friend (SOLO/DUO), in that case you will play with 4 or 3 random teammates. There are also full squad and clan match game modes, but there are fewer tactical possibilites compared to CS:GO (due to no round-start buy, less grenades, no weapon carry-over to next round, no drop weapon)."
13980,"this game has been picked up by one of the most imfamous 3rd party software (hacks) developers out there.

NO NA SERVERS"
13981,"all i saw when i tried to do the tutorial was black, nothing else, this takes number one in worst games ever made because its literally unplayable"
13982,game crashes as soon as i open it.
13983,"Man I dont know what to say about this game. Lets start at the begining, im looking at steam for free games and see this, see that it has some cool stuff and get it. I play it and I love it... then I months later I finally spend money get the gold tide skin play it for a little bit longer and take a break. Then when i came back i started to relize that this game is just not good, and I dont mean its terrible just not a good game, I started to relize this when I saw that weapons like the new machine pistol and the katana were only able to get in the loot boxes, and even thought they fixed one by adding it the metal shop (and I dont know if they added something new to the melees I stopped playing a couple months ago), and they defending what they did saying that they are ""adding a melee weapon"" and al I could think was ""why didn't you just add them for the f2p players first."" But yeah I stopped playing unistalled and got some money of the skins I had, but do I some random in steam tell you what you want, no get the game if you want it and have see if you like it. But lets talk about the good and the bad, the weapons feel like they want to be skill based but they just are not close, I mean the meta is like the older cs games, go for the ak revolver/deagle and have a sniper then the other slot is up to you, but yeah the weapons are a meh. Ok then I'll tell you about two games i had ones good and the other just something I wish I never stayed in, so lets start with the good game cause I just want to feel a little happy about this game before I talk about the second, ahem, this story starts us in that one dust map I forgot about, my team is losing and we now only have 2 players me and this other guy (oh this is 5v5 demolition) its like 2 to 6 maybe idk and then 3 players join and I was just happy to have some teammates, then started to carry me and the other guy and we won, that was the best game I had on there. Now lets get into the bad game, Im just gonna lay it straight, me and my brother play the same game and we were losing, we didnt care we just wanted to mess around, and while thats going on people are typing in the chat and the best player on our team said ""are team is having fun"" and he was telling the truth (well to my knowledge) no one was typing in team chat talking about how this game stucked and me and my brother didnt complain, but the players on the other team just couldn't handle it and started being cancer, let me end it short the game sucked and I just wanted my time back. So if your for some reason still reading this (god this must be a long read) don't hate me for my opinion, I wont judge if you like this game, but if this does get you to think should I get this well I'll be shocked that you took time to think ""should I not get this game cause some random said it was a bad"" then stop that, have your own opinion, dont let others think for you, and if you want this game then is at the low low price of free so get it if you want it people I probally wasted both of our times cause I took the time to right it and you took your time to read it, bye."
13984,im not to far in but so far its pretty good but like others have said the maps are to simple its easy to find yourself in the enemy spawn they need more complextiy to them
13985,"Decent game, game play is good espiaclly because its free the graphics are good, so over all a decent game.
 just dont play it with 2 active monitors while playing it, the game dosent lock ur mouse to game window so you will often click outside the game screen and minimize it.
the game uses skins the same as cs:go do,"
13986,"can u guys put this game on mac os x pls 
:)"
13987,"I guess a blind person made all of the maps? Don't waste your, oh it doesn't cost money? Don't download it still."
13988,"Personally, I love this game and have spent money on this game when I never thought I would. Everything is so balanced it would make Ubisoft go REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE and its just over all a great game. Only thing I would want personally would be more PvE game modes or mini-missions or something."
13989,Better than fukin csgo
13990,"great
"
13991,nice game
13992,i can't open black squad even now!
13993,"i recommend this game because it free and you can sell skin on steam market.
BS community isn't small and provides updates almost every months."
13994,Not a bad FPS game considering its free.
13995,"Very good indeed, so pashol nahui and go play you urod blyat."
13996,it have some bugs but totaly it's a beautiful game :D
13997,DEVS HAVE DESTROYED THIS GAME. Its absolutely BS (bull shit) now dont play it and do some heavenly deed.
13998,THIS GAME RULES When i was like 9 I Downloaded on 2gb ram laptop it litrally on Lowst graphs went like 100+ fps love this game
13999,GG
14000,The gunplay is alright but the map design is utter trash. The audio design is very cheap. The lack of voice chat stunts any real teamwork you can get with randoms and anyone who has a 5 man in a discord chat is going to dominate you. Also I dislike the fact that you cannot give callouts in text chat after dying considering there is no voice chat and everyone else is always qued up together in a discord.
14001,"Don't get me wrong. Overall game is great.But there are a couple of things makes me real sick. I like to play destruction airborne, capture modes. In destruction mode a person takes the sniper rifle, such as blazer , Dragunov,m107a1 standing same spot whole game, doesn't do any destruction to the crates or never used parachute, he just trying to kill other players same place! I totally bored using a smoke grenade over and over again but that kind of noob never use any other weapon and some idiots call this a tactic. Second thing, people writing their mother tongue in waiting list chat! I warning  them so many times, there are other people here from different countries but they won't listen and they Insist to talk their own language! Doesn't care to use whisper chat or clan chat.
As I said before have no problem with this game.But some ""players"" makes me angry.(Talking about European server)"
14002,"This is one of the better shooters I have played recently. The guns are varied but balanced, trading damage for accuracy and lower recoil. No gun seems op, although some are stronger overall than others. Guns are pretty easy to unlock, you get all your attachments by default and there is zero pay to win bullshit. If you are in the mood to try a fun pc fps, give it a shot."
14003,Worst game ever :). Used to be the best f2p fps game but not anymore. Ive like 1300hours playtime so you know that i know a lot about this game..
14004,the game is great. i love it. the graphics are nice the gameplay. its one of my favorite games
14005,They stole the Farcry 3 main screen music lol. gg
14006,SAD
14007,I had fun playing this game with my friends.
14008,Plagiarize Warface. Hate Korean games.
14009,bad game brother - HH
14010,As a long time CS player (even though I haven't played recently) I can tell you that if you want a team based shooter just play CS. This game is a low budget piece of garbage. One game was enough to warrant an uninstall.
14011,Blalala
14012,great f2p game
14013,"We need A Vampire Mode. where the opposite team plays as vampires . PLEASE !!!!!
"
14014,"Pro:
Free Sorta
Pretty Skins

Con:
Getting spawn killed is too common
Skins skins skins but no content
Unbalanced as frickin heck
LOOOOOOOOOOOOONG Wait Times! (like 10 mins to find one match) Seriously most of my 'time playing' is really just waiting in lobbies
No one will play anything except Team Death Match and whatever is first on the quick play (not very quick) list.

It's playable for the first 100 hours after that it feels like a cheap CSGO knockoff. Can't recommend."
14015,"Awesome Game!

Try it!!"
14016,"If you're into those old korean F2P shooters like Combat Arms, Operation 7, Alliance of Valiant Arms, CrossFire etc., you might find something you enjoy. 

Pros: Good netcode and hitboxes. 
         Game is easy to run. 

Cons: Combat is bland, simplistic and repetitive. 
          Lack of ways to change up your playstyle other than swapping between weapon classes. 
          Claustrophobic UI in menus and lack of FoV slider."
14017,i was playing 1 month and now i cant play thats not good.
14018,One of the best free to play game everr
14019,"HMMMMMM better then csgo?
(Insert lenny here)

i like it"
14020,I love BS!!.
14021,"I will edit this if I can manage to get this game working properly and add in what worked for me, but I'm NOT going to spend a lot of time with it trying.

I wish I could say that I ""feel"" like it has potential, but I can't even play the game to play unless it's in safe mode. Which quite frankly, sucks. I've done everything I've found on the internet to get this game working properly but I just can't get it to run. 

I really would like to enjoy it and add to the ""great"" reviews that people seem to post, which by the way, have no real info on how the game runs, but I can't. So, it's a negative from me."
14022,braindead game
14023,.
14024,"I used to played this game a lot back in 2018 but now I'm done with it because...

- TERRIBLE map design
- Devs are greedy now
- The game characters goes WEEABOO shit!
- The recoil is terrible
- The hit box is so bad
- Take long time to play quick match
- Try to be a realistic game but weapon mechanics screw it up
- Grenade everywhere (Should rename this game to GRENADE SQUAD)
- Black screen problem (Should rename this game to BLACK SCREEN)
- Some game mode is pointless"
14025,TAC RELOAD
14026,"so after playing literal 5 minutes of the game i can say the great is bloody great, but cant stay in game long enough to complete a whole match due to no aussie servers as of yet. please oh please get aussie servers"
14027,"very good game, teams are epically unbalanced but win or loose and you will enjoy this game.  

this game does not feel pay to win"
14028,sucks
14029,"At first sight this is a promising first person shooter that has zero pay to win elements, as most weapons are purchasable using in-game currency, which can be earned from daily logins and match rewards. The game ships with a variety of modes such as Team Death Matches for people wishing to dive straight into action, Demolition and Assassination as seen from Counter Strike for the old veterans, along with class based Destruction mode for larger scale warfare. There is definitely something for everyone.

Good as it may sound on paper, the title is ultimately marred by the lackluster performance of Battleye, which has enabled the cheating minority to spread like rash.

It doesn’t help when both the developers and publishers rely on players to report cheaters through a ticket system outside of the game, which is cumbersome and time consuming to use. Moderators inside the game are either non-existent, or they are very much determined to wipe their hands clean on monitoring the game. It also falls upon the legitimate players to record actual videos as evidence, before any bans can be considered.

Before anyone accuse me of exaggerating the problem, the following thread has an Aimbot cheater that fully admits to his wrongdoing, while bragging about the behaviour without any form of subtlety in the forums. With 14 k/d ratio and multiple confirmations from different community members, guess what happened? Nothing. The community managers merely locked the thread and call it a day, with no punishment handed out to the cheater, not even a slap on the wrist. Take a look yourself and be amazed by the sheer commitment of the game’s staff: -

https://steamcommunity.com/app/550650/discussions/0/1736593325990229870/

This begs the question if Battleye has any use in the review process at all? And if not, why isn’t the VAC system considered instead? At the least, a VAC ban would deter any would be cheaters more so than a mere kick from a match, which the offenders can immediately attempt to rejoin in seconds.

While the community continues to divide upon the cheating problem, as evident in the forum which you are free to check for yourselves, the game is busying itself with the introduction of more optional loot boxes. Not a healthy sign to go on if you ask my opinion.

Besides the aforementioned problem with cheaters, this game also suffers from poor map designs, which can be summarised as trite and mundane. Most of the time you will be forced to pick a route and repeat ad nauseam with little leeway for alternatives, that or be strong armed into an asymmetrical map that clearly favours one side more than the other. To compound to the problem, the developers have enabled demolition maps in team death matches, which is plainly not suited for such a mode. With fixed spawn points for both teams, matches always turn into a camp fest within minutes. So get ready to camp or be camped, both of which isn’t much fun to experience.

Lastly, the biggest issue must be the match balancing, which is absolutely ridiculous and incompetent. The game does not seem to care about your k/d ratio or rank when considering a match, it is only interested in balancing your win and lose ratio. So the moment you obtain 51% win rate, the game will seek to punish you with seething hatred, grouping you against the top dogs until you are beaten and humbled. And the moment you obtain 49% win rate, you will be grouped against players who have yet to figure out which way the gun point towards, hand holding you all the way until things are even again.

The beta competitive mode is even worse, matching a full team of Cobras (highest rank) against random nobodies, or stuffing a veteran with a team of babies, who is then fated to carry the whole game like a nanny without pay. This is the opinion from someone who has played the first 3 beta seasons from start to finish, which the developers have successfully made each iteration worse by some twisted miracles.

So you wish to see a summary of my verdict? That would be a resounding no at this point. Not until the glaring issues are addressed with some efforts first.

* Review updated to reflect recent game changes."
14030,Could be a great game if it did not run like shit. My system is over qualified but has persistent stuttering with this game and only this game. Others also have the issue I have looked up and it has been a thing since the game came out with no fucks given for resolving it
14031,It's a good game early access but good
14032,its really worth my time but the skins and case are not worth it
14033,I like it
14034,Recommend to change your antivirus system crew. Please enable report function as another alternative way to get rid of cheaters too.
14035,combat arms is better
14036,"Olá, eu sei que está meio tarde pra escrever minha analise, pois o jogo fez 2 anos já, e eu joguei no beta, mas acho que ainda posso escrever a MINHA critica sobre o game.
Bom, vamos lá.
A ideia do Black Squad, o que o jogo propos, tem um certo destaque ja que o jogo no inicio foi um grande sucesso, ele é Play2Win, tudo, LITERALMENTE TODAS AS ARMAS DO JOGO voce consegue ter apenas jogando, até mesmo as skins(demora mas voce consegue), os mapas da fase beta do game eram incriveis, balanceados e bem detalhados, e muito bem feitos, ja os mapas que foram sendo adicionados em seguida nao teve o mesmo nivel, e foi caindo cada vez mais, os graficos do game sao um pouco razoaveis, nada muito RTX2080Ti, mas agrada o olhar.
a Jogabilidade do jogo deixa um pouco a desejar, tenta mizeravelmente imitar outros jogos como CS, CF e PB, mas como sao jogos que apresentam a mesma ideia, nao posso criticar muito.
O Jogos tem inumeras armas, muito bem balanceadas, com INUMERAS skins(isso é o pior ponto do game, mas ja chego lá).
o Servidor, atualmente está em CrossService(todos os servidores juntos), e o jogo errou mizeravelmente nisso, mas nao posso falar muito pois eles nao vao arrumar isso. o jogo contem um Tickrate de 32(horrivel), e mesmo com uma internet considerada boa(por volta de uns 50/100Mbps) voce ainda ira jogar com um ping entre 25/40(isso no servidor BRASILEIRO). a HitBox do jogo é algo lamentavel, ainda mais com o Tickrate.
agora vamos falar da comunidade, apenas algumas palavras, alguns sao tóxicos, o resto é de boa.
No caso das Atualizações que o game tem, umas 2/3 por mes, basicamente é a NEOWIZ ENFIANDO MAIS SKINS NO GAME, ou adicionando armas novas, e apenas uma vez por mes ela arruma os bugs e ""ouve"" a comunidade, mas literalmente todo mes tem SKINS NOVAS e armas novas pra voce, ou seja, o jogo esta focado em adicionar conteudo(inutil) do que arrumar o que ja esta no game.
Bom, essa foi minha analise, um pouco superficial, mas apenas para aqueles que nao QUEREM UMA BIBLIA pra ler kk.

Minha nota do game seria 4/10
mas pode variar, vai que no futuro o jogo melhore.
Bom Jogo a todos GGWP


A steam Me avisou que ja passou 280hrs de jogo desde essa analise, E SIM O JOGO CONTINUA RUIM 3.5/10

14039,this is so bad even tho im bad at the game i still find the AI hacking its like they see you through walls if you dont fix this i will rename it to stupid squad (that i already did i meant to rename it back XD)
14040,"Tried it for an hour or two, it's meh"
14041,"If you're looking for a free CS-like game, look no further. Grouping up with friends could be better (we have difficulty getting on the same team), but all in all it's a blast to play if you enjoy COD or CS."
14042,"At first, when I downloaded the game, i thought that my pc is not gonna be able to carry it, because I have a pretty low-end laptop. But i was amazed by how well this game is optimised! It has alot of skins, frequent updates, that add new and new content. I'm VERY satisfied with this this game."
14043,Awesome
14044,it's a good game free

14046,"Fun, fast paced game 10/10 love it."
14047,Best game ever! Wish it could get more attention.
14048,"Players who are really good at Black Squad claim this game is nothing like CS:GO, but to me it really is a free CS:GO"
14049,"I really like the game probaly one of the best fps free to play games the sounds when someone dies eh. But other than that good decent amount of guns nice skins totally recommend it!!! (:
"
14050,The music tho o_o
14051,VERY NICE!
14052,Ok...
14053,If you wanna play an MMO FPS with awesome graphics? I recommend this game what I don't recommend is that when you play a solo quick match you'll be facing off with a 4 man clan with one random (or maybe their member with a smurf account). I spent money on this game and I regret every cent
14054,"amazing game and also  free to play  ,,"
14055,"Server locations and map design are awful
 - Many lobbies have an average of 90 ping
 - Maps that aren't mirrored are completely broken
 - There is a lack of regard for spawn placements and timings
 - Verticality is not managed very well in some of the maps as there are one way angles when entering or exiting stairwells
 - Environmental sounds are poorly mixed and make some parts of the map unbearable to play in


Poorly translated with UI dating back to 2006
 - Unable to use any of the menus while in lobby or queue
 - Unable to kick, mute, or report players 
 - Support for windowed fullscreen, refresh rate, and frame limiter
 - Three sets of sensitivities for each loadout, was a good idea but falls apart when switching weapon types during a round
 

The gameplay itself is pretty fun 
 - Zero acceleration movement similar to other fps games of its time
 - Spray patterns with significantly more variation, I'd say about twice as much as csgo
 - TTK is usually equivalent to most competitive shooters with rifles needing three body shots or one headshot and snipers 1 hitting above the legs but can be significantly higher due to the terrible ping and lag compensation that occurs in most games
 - There is limb penetration with the highest damaging limb being counted

The devs and staff do not communicate with the playerbase in any significant way

I can recommend this game for the first couple of hours but after that it gets very stale and overall frustrating"
14056,"Very Good Game, I Like This Game"

14069,"1. My F****ing ass this game is is early access. It's already finished they just call it early access to get away with a few bugs and game modes. 
2. This game is unbalanced aaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssss FF**************************************CK. Recoil etc. makes no sense. Headshots are easy af.
3. This game is absolutely Pay-to-Win!!!!!!!!!!!! You need somewhat over 24 hours or even more to get enough in game ""currency"" to buy a decent gun, which you obv can get faster by spending real money.
4. This game is worse than mw2 when we are talking about ""noobtube"" and grenades. 
5. Oh and filled with kids who play this game at shitty internet cafe's who dont understand what the objective is."

14071,BEST FPS GAME EVER PLAYED BUT BUGS NEED TO BE FIXED SOON
14072,"good FPS. No stupid scorestreaks or specialist abilities. Boots on the ground, Guns and grenades competitive shooter. the maps are perfect size and all seemingly have ""lanes"" to them where you are always bound to find some action. the matches are fast paced and fun. i highly recommend this game if you want a good old school feeling shooter"
14073,Fun to play.
14074,pretty fun
14075,now i want to say when the game was in beta it was better than now now every thing in game is stupid balance ping guns community for market or even the game so i tell you dont waste your time for this game
14076,why its say ready to play but once i lauch the the game it say please install the update and restart the game ?????????????
14077,"Indeed a game with great FPS experience. Fun and engaging, while requiring a skill ceiling that is pretty damm high. Some suggetstions: would love to see the option for different scope attachments, and also the hit detection could be a bit better. 
4/5

PS: Alright, now as I am playing this game for a month I found some issues, most notable one is the hit registration, like when you shoot someone and you can see the blood splatter on the surface behind him and hear the hitsound, but then you die and see that he has full health. This is unacceptable for any game, and one of the main reasons that the game is dying and losing players every day. 
2.5/5"

14079,"Good old days...
spent 2 years non-stop on this game which was so fun and entertaining, but this game died like B / O and lacks players which barely gets 3K players online at same time, and i guess we all know why...
this game got killed by development which didn't care about the community and did what they wanted like not banning cheaters which was the base of the problems.
Lack of new weapons and non-stop improvement and updates like before literally killed this game and im so sorry for that. it was like no other games for me which i really enjoyed playing every single bit of it, but sadly we wont see the old great BS with full of players like before."
14080,Point Blank 2.0
14081,"movement feels off and the diffrence between f2p guns and pay currency guns is quite big. The maps at least for tdm suck,  you can get spawn camped  or may have to spawn camp to get kills. waste of time dont bother with this game better f2p fps out there."
14082,Spend 15$ go play CSGO instead. This game is about as boring an generic as it gets boring... boring/uninspired art/maps mechanics about a deep as a puddle.
14083,Game won't launch; intro music plays and then just sits at a white screen.  At least it uninstalled painlessly.
14084,Got one game in and it was fun but now always crashes when I push space to confirm loadout. /New information/ It is now telling me I have a high ping restriction with only 100 saying normal in the N/A server and is fine with me going to east asia with 500
14085,"Sometimes it's fun, sometimes you keep getting the same map 20 times in a row.
Matchmaking is completely fucked
Chat system is completely fucked
Maps are WAY too small
Seems like sensitivity changes with each weapon you use
No place to easily test weapons
Did I mention maps are WAY TOO SMALL
Constantly join losing games, and not just a few kills behind, like 4k points compared to 30k points. Totally balanced.
Fun game if the devs actually had a brain."
14086,"With the new management came new things such as no market or trade, new in game store and menu design, and removal of weapons from store."

14091,"Another awful F2P FPS. Where to even start?

- There are A LOT of hackers in this game, and no anti-cheat to even begin to mitigate them. 
- The game engine is buggy as hell. (Beginning of the round for some mystifyingly stupid reason, your gun has one bullet missing.. Like wtf idiots?)
- Graphics are straight out of the 90s for the maps. 
- The gameplay itself is a direct ripoff of Counter-Strike in EVERY WAY.

Interestingly, it seems to be the same game engine as Ghost in the Shell First Assault was using. But their implementation of it is laughable at best.

I recommend avoiding this game at all costs; unless you want a convenient way to torture prisoners. Making them play this will certainly do the trick!"
14092,This game is better than C S
14093,A PRETTY GOOD FREE GAME NOT THAT HARD TO PLAY MAKES FUN BUT I WOULDNT PLAY IT AS MUCH AS CSGO ETC.
14094,"Fun game, but the point system is whack. I just played a game where I had 12/9/6 and a guy on my team got 12/5/26. Same kills...I got more assists...and he died more than 3 times as much as I did, yet his score was 2900 and mine was 2000. WTF! So I guess just running in and dying is the key to points. What a stupid scoring system. Rewarding the retard. SMH"

14101,Good Game how ever would like to seem Australian (Oceanic) Servers added into the game as the South East Asia Servers do not supply the Australian community with a low enough ping to play the game at it's full potential.
14102,"A shitty Asian cash grab. Note that the quick play mechanic is either broken or does not play well with low player counts, as I was unable to get a server during American dead hours (1-4am)
The game basically rips all its mechanics, map design, etc. from Counter Strike. Except it somehow flubs it and everything is just worse and.. bad. You don't get to buy guns or anything, just respawn in with one of three custom loadouts. And it flubs the moment-to-moment CS gameplay as everything just feels hokey and weird.
If you do decide you're in the mood for a shitty Counter Strike clone, then you need to contend with the progression system; there are FOUR currencies, and it isn't quite clear why any overlap exists between them. It just feels tacked on in order to get even more dosh out of you, like a crappy phone game.
The voice acting is also 200% terrible, showing they couldn't even pay someone to give a crap about their game.

Just don't play it, man. Play Blacklight Retribution instead."
14103,"my simple words dont play..

This game fails with the design of maps.. it is practically spawnkilling game..
People nade more than that they shoot. so no tactics involved at all. creep up spawn then nade the spawn like a mofo.
and last thing if you are a gamer and know how shitty battleeye is well then i dont need to add more. its just a huge gay fest"
14104,Shouldn't have to be on an Admin account to get the game to start.
14105,like csgo but better then that i like the skins on gun
14106,It was a fun game... When it worked. Every time I attempt to start the game it just shows a white screen and nothing else happens

14108,played a bit... is fun for casual gaming.
14109,"this game is pretty well made

14110,"Awful menus, awful graphics, awful gameplay, awful audio, awful networking, awful microtransactions, awful map design.

No improvement since I played the Beta."
14111,"It's Crazy Game So Far Cuz It's Free To Play, Not Needed To Bet Real Money We Can Buy Some Nice Guns. And Similar To COD, CSGO, And The Other Good FPP Games. That's Why I Think It's Crazy."
14112,Please add PVE!
14113,"I think I'm going to stop with this game. After three thousand hours I think I can have my say. I have been playing since september 2017 and have always played BS as f2p. I've always tried to keep the community of this game as clean as possible. Season 1, the cheaters were few and had a simple life. The game still presented itself with a few small errors but it was there as it was the beginning. Season 2, the cheaters begin to show up and here they start sending the first reports, adding also those who use the Two Faced map bug on site B. (WHICH STILL HAS NOT BEEN SOLVED TODAY). Season 3, the game remains almost identical by putting some events and creating multiple tournaments of different kinds. Nothing striking with more and more cheaters. Season 4, I hoped it was the rebirth but nothing, I try not to abandon the game by spending a few pennies to support the game and create a clan to find goals to set (which has NEVER been done by the game itself). The cheaters decrease not considerably perhaps from the fact that I will have sent 500 tickets. Season 5. The cheaters are there, problems of the first season are still present, the community decreases due to too many cheaters there are, there is no adequate control or the GM are efficient, people are continually creating smurf on smurf to use the cheat and absolutely nothing is done, we think about organizing the event for valentine's day. They tried to make a completely useless new map, built very badly where you can go to the roofs (one of the millions of bugs). Well, what to say in conclusion. I have given body and soul for this game, I have proposed even without being paid to be an admin and collaborate in a more substantial way. But at the end of it all, ZERO collaboration on their part."

after new updates black squad dead !!

14115,NICE dinamic game
14116,"This is by far the best first person shooter on the market, and its completly free and not pay-2-win.  You can gain a slight advantage buy spending cash on guns if you want , but players like myself have  earned nearly every gun just by playing.  
Starter weapons are balanced and competitive with premium guns, your not at a disadvantage at all just starting out.  

The game has duo/squads/solo que for team death match.   This is the mode im reviewing, tho there is battle-mode  similar to say a battlefield type game with classes and objectives, and also demolition similar to say counter-strike.

When im recruiting for my squads sometimes i notice players with only 6 hours in-game xp and they are mopping the floor with players with way more time invested, simply beacuse they are better at aiming.

the aiming system in this game is absolutely perfect could not ask for anything better period. job well done.

coming from an expert marksman [ i have over 20 years experience in cs 1.6 , cs source, cs:go [ i dont like] , battlefield 1942, vietnam, 2    2142,   and many other games , dirty bomb , tf2 , paladins 

i am a FPS veteran and i stand by the game heavily  I'm writing this review to help the developer with praise and help the community grow,  im sure some new players will pick this game up and love it.

really good game , just make sure to educate yourself on game modes and guns.
high skill cap so good players may do amazing things but its not cheats just good skill"
14117,"This game is pretty dope to be frankly. Free and fair. You can't find another free game as better than this one. However, there is still  some unequal matchmaking in rank. But I don't blame them. They just came out this patch with the rank system recently. They sure killed it with this rank system thing. Very good game !"
14118,High ping on Indian servers
14119,im addicted to this game
14120,ass
14121,"The Devs need to do a better job at making sure the game is fair and those who cheat are banned. currently as far as their terrible UI shows there is no reporting option which leaves bad actors free to do what ever they want.

Devs should also be aware just how easy it is to buy one of the hacking tools, just google Black Squad Hacking first 2 links are hacking sites offereing their tools dirt cheap."
14122,"Pretty fun game. Free to play and not much ""Pay-to-win"" (that ive seen thus far). Has some fun quick match modes and competive mode (have not tested yet). The servers arent all that great but they're not bad either. The game itself feels like a blend of Counter-Strike and MW2. Not exactly a new or innovative game by any means but the fact it brings some nostalgia from older games and is still unique in its own way is nice. Would I pay for this game? Truth be told I would not. SImply because it isn't new or innovative. But as far as it being a free game and not a large file size I do reccommend trying the game for yourself. Specs arent very high so you really don't need a high end computer to run it all. Audio wise the game is kinda meh. It sounds good but the sounds arent realistic. Not that I excect real sounding guns or firefights. But the sounds do sound more arcade like to me (Time Crisis 3/House of Dead). Graphically speaking the game is ok looking. Its not omg this looks amazing but its not like a 8-bit cartridge game either. Gameplay is good. I personally had to tweak a few key bindings myself. Some of the default bindings are weird so to speak. Like gameplay wise it feels like MW2 and CS but the keys are not really catered to that per say. Not exactly a con or anything just preference. Not a diifcult game from what ive played of it. People don't really play tactially or use teamwork. Its really just a RNG (Run-N-Gun) game at the end of the day. Like trying to play strategy wise seems easier said then done. I havent seen an in-game voice system; only text. So communicating & working together in a fast paced RNG isn't really going to happen when half the team is just running and shooting anything they see move and there are zero callouts. Only way to really have communication is to party up and have a 3rd party system for voice chat. Playing with random people? Want communication? Not gonna happen unless you're a Mavis Beacon pro tbh. Most use of the chat system just seems to be players talking trash or calling others cheaters. Not sure how much cheating is in the game as I have not yet encountered it. Not saying people don't cheat. Just saying that I have not personally come across it yet. At the end of the day I do think this game is at least worth a try. 

-Gameplay: 7/10 Good game, smooth mechanics just not original by any means.
-Audio: 6/10 Sounds good but sounds really arcade like
-Graphics: 5/10 The game looks good but by no means a jaw dropper or impressive
-Story: NA
-In Game Communication: 1/10 No voice chat, only text which isn't practical for mid gameplay
-Ease to Run: 9/10 Easy game to run on a low end computer. It isn't minesweeper so you will need some hardware to run.
 Reccomendation: WORTH A TRY"
14123,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

14125,its good game
14126,i recommend this game because its interesting and its a player friendly game. i hope the mods/creator will add zombie mode in the game :D
14127,"played quite a few matches, every match there was at least 1 person dominating the match and getting 1 shot kills, I would unload into them from behind and the would 1 shot me, the lag is terrible even though it says north american server it runs like I am playing on a server in australia, deleting this garbage, there are better f2p shooters on microsoft store, this game was a waste of my time"

14130,"Black Squad is an Unreal Engine 3 powered tactical shooter developed and published by Neowiz Games. It aims to compete with other lobby based Korean tactical shooters like CrossFire and Alliance of Valiant Arms. Like other tactical shooters players earn money by playing games and use it to purchase new weapons to use on the battlefield. Play each round as either the Vipers (Terrorists) or the Peacekeapers (UN Backed Counter-Terrorists) across multiple maps and game modes.

Black Squad Key Features:

Varied Game Modes – Enjoy 10+ unique game modes from traditional team deathmatch / demolition to more exotic VIP defense.
Stat Tracking – Track your individual performance (KDR/Dmg/Headshots/etc) with each individual weapon.
Quickplay Matchmaking – Skip the pesky server lobby and find a match quickly.
Familiar Gameplay / Interface - Inspired by traditional Korean based lobby shooters like AvA and Combat Arms."

14133,nice
14134,"New players should stay away from this game in this current state. Many things are still broken like auto team balancing that doesn't seem to do anything, along with the latency issues. It runs so terribly that although the FPS counter in the corner proudly boasts 75-100 FPS, it really feels like 15-20 because the game itself stutters frequently, mostly have to due with the servers. Weapon balancing still needs a few more tweeks for it to really be ready for prime time. Certain weapons are so underpowered and useless you might as well show up with blanks."
14135,deffinitly recomend it...game has a few hackers here and there but overall for a free to play its absolutly great fun
14136,Nice Call of Duty type shooter
14137,Add voice chat support// very hard to communicate by X/Z

Pros:
- No Pay2Win.
- Good Clan / Clanwar system.
- 3 Sets of equipment that u can choose on every Roundstart.
- Many Settinngs to mess around with.
- U can run it on a Toaster plugged into a Potato.
- The Tutorial shows the most importent Stuff and does not take to much Time.
- No overpowered stuff.
- The Gunplay feels Good

Cons:
- To many Grenade Launchers.
- Some maps are really confusing for beginners.
- TDM maps are just mirrored Maps. (at least it makes it balanced)
- To many Grenade Launchers.
- Crouchspamming is a real thing

8/10
"
14142,This is awsome game
14143,"Very nice addictive game
A big variety if guns.
Need some improvement regarding fps.
 problems in that game are cheaters who wanna prove their fake ability 
to just win regardless of fun.
Users of low stability guns as AK use mouse macros for no recoil
same problem as cs go"
14144,"I love this game!

An arena style game with a classic feel (no fancy gadgets or other such BS), it is entirely F2P, and not P2W, for the simple reason, that is heavily based on skill. It doesn't matter if you're using the starter assault rifle or a rare paid loot box rifle (which is just a regular rifle with a cool paint job), it only matters how well you can use that rifle! You need to figure out whether you excel with a weapon that has a high rate of fire, or one with high accuracy.

Your health is low, and your damage is high. It's all about your reaction time, patience, and strategy. This is a game where skill matters, especially in the survival-type modes.

Now, for the downsides:

1. The female avatars require either a LOT of time or a small payment. (Just add a basic female avatar, in full military gear, OK? Women play games too...)
2. You can't test weapons in a gun range before purchasing them. This is such an obvious feature, it's shocking that every FPS doesn't have it!
3. Not enough maps. Or guns. Or customization options. Not a big deal, really, I just like the game, and I'd like there to be more of it!

In summation, I give Black Squad 9/10. One of the best FPS games out there.


P.S. Please add a pink P90 called ""P-Chan"". The nerds of the world will thank you!

P.P.S. I love the P90...."
14145,"This game is such a massive pile of autistic♥♥♥♥♥♥that is 10 times more hazardous to your health than ebola.

I just wish they'd add a mode that it's predesser - Alliance Valliant Arms - had. I'm talking about the Zombies mode."

14165,build a real game you fucks
14166,Meh
14167,Once you get past the cheasy tutorial this game is actually a really good COD substitute if you don't want to shell out the extra money for a FPS. The only two cons I can think of atm is that it needs more customization and game modes. Considering this game is free; it blows away any expectations.
14168,"well, it's a cool game but if wish you could make a good anti-cheat system, cuase this one is terrible."
14169,"If I had to describe this game in one word it would be, Grenades. For the love of god, just buy csgo, these jews even copied the letters for bomb sites."
14170,"Possibly one of the best f2p games on steam as of 2018. The fluid game mechanics, the frequent updates and fixes, and the non pay to win aspect of black squad makes this a must have for any person in the market for a free fps similar to counterstrike."
14171,Very fun!
14172,Basically this game is a heft rip off of another game known as ironsight the developers have created a buggy masterpiece that is full of bugs.

14190,Dont play this game. It says free to play but all thats free in it is anger over guns people buy with real money that are 10 times stronger then the free ones. Not to mention buying a female character means you become a GOD becuase you have more health and less area to be hit. The makers of this game should be shut down

The perfect cross between CoD and Counter Strike.

Maps could be better .I am curently playing mostly TDM and some maps are prone to campfests and spawn abuse.

Shotguns are suppose to be really deadly up close but not for this game, NEVER buy a shotgun in this game.
Other than this community that dont know how to play its an easy game to play if you know how to play FPS and want easy kill i'd recommend playing this game just to kill time."
14212,good game
14213,"One of the worst FPS games I have ever played lol 

Also, this is a cash grab. Free to Play but really ""buy our special deals to get coins which you can then spend on for GOOD guns!"""

Overall just a solid FPS game with no P2W factors. Getting kills in this game is really satisfying."
14223,"22 Start up game, play tutorial, start match. Generic COD clone. Open steam overlay, game crashes. Open up the game again, white screen until I CTRL+ALT+DEL. The game was free, but I feel I need a refund for the 22 minnutes of my life wasted."
14224,"The game feels like a budget CS:GO copy, the weapons handle like trash, people are bullet sponges, there's no OCE servers, and there's a big dependence on getting gear from boxes."
14225,Go play CS:GO
14226,Blacksquad is great and reminds me of CS:GO/Counter strike however the weapons can be hard to get and paid weapons are stronger and you can get better guns but it takes a while but it is good that you can achieve new weapons without paying
14227,this game is so fucking unstable to get a fucking kill u need 2 have better weapons than the starter ones i put 8 bullets with my starter ar and he put 4 and he still killed me wouldnt reccomend just go play csgo or battlefield even cod

14231,"So ive only played about an hour worth of the game. Did the tutorial, played two matchs of tdm and kinda messed around a little with just basic game controls and fit them to my play style. But all in all im giving it a 8/10 so far. Pretty basic style shooter for anyone whose played CoD or BF or really any shooter. The two maps I played on were very asemetrical, pretty easy to figure out choke points. So that kinda derailed the game a bit for me cause it seemed once your team held a hot zone you pretty much won. But again Ive only played one game mode and only two games so take that with grain of salt. But so far pretty stoked! Best part its free and I like free lol. Ive been looking for just a basic shooter like this to stream on my twitch channel (www.twitch.tv/rivalx1525) so it will do pretty good. More info to come as I get more into it."
14232,Amazing Game
14233,it gay
14234,"Overall a good game. 

EXCEPT :
1. Team balance need lots of improvements. High ranked players are always against low ranked players in my game so obviously the 1 team will dominate the other.

2. There is no kick function or vote system. If the player is lagging with high ping kick the player so it won't create a bad experience for the other players.

3. More options for quick match. Now there is only 1 option. It's very hard to find a game with pistol only or sniper only unless we search through the custom maps.

14235,"Played for a bit, it was pretty good, would recomend if your a fan of FPS's"

1. Open game, stuck on a white screen. Tab out and back in to fix.
2. Press the pause button? Game crashes

14253,"Fantastic game,   has a CS 1.6 feel with half decent graphics and great gameplay."
14254,"Fun, but full of unrealized potential.

All TDM maps are too small, which causes serious congestion and spawning issues. If you can't move past your allies to escape a spawn trap that's a big problem. Since the maps are so small there's little room for variation which leads to less motivation to play.

Shotguns are very underwhelming. They take too many shots to kill and you get too few rounds.

Weapons don't seem to perform the way their stats indicate. For example, I notice that I have more range and accuracy with the PECHENEG than with the MK46, especially with controlled bursts or single shots, when their stats would have you believe otherwise. Not sure if that's just me though.

There is no variety in the daily loot boxes. I have probably 30 of the same grenade and 10 of the same banner.

Why do you always spawn missing 1 round in your clip?

Definitely more than worth the $2 I've put in to it, but it won't be enough to keep me around a long period of time."

14271,"I great game if you lived in Asia and America. I'm from Australia and I used to play with heaps of mates until the ping only got worse. Originally playing at over 150ping which was bad enough to now 300+

I've bought heaps of skins off here but but it seems all us Aussies are switching to another game.
RIP"
14272,game that is good like csgo ................
14273,Is A VEri NIcE GaME
14274,Hey guys. I dont know why but I didn't get my free 1 year anniversary dlc..  any idea why?
14275,good
14276,gud gaym
14277,nice game my first steam game to play
14278,Black Squad is an amazing game for the price! Play this.. You will not regret it!!
14279,its preety fun
14280,Nice simple game to play casually. :))
14281,"I do recommend  play this game it is fun and challenge but if you dont like that you can start up a lobby with yours friends to play with and train with the weapons so you and your friends can have better aim.

I'm AllMUSTDIE-BO1 guess what game/who say that."
14282,"This game doesn't know what it wants to be, it may have call of duty-like gameplay, but you can't run like counterstrike, it is a frankenstiens monster of a game that just does not work"
14283,"Do not download. Just to find a game takes you 7 precise clicks in the menu. To buy a ""create"" it takes you 1 click. By ""precise"" i mean that the interface is flooded with shit ton of shit which makes trying to find those 7 buttons to click to actually play a game terrible. Playing that game is another thing - it's reatrded as fuck, the whole game looks like 2010 browser shooter and all of the mechanics are such.

Do not recommend."
14284,"Takes around 30 minutes to setup the game because defaults are completely messed up, if you can even start it.
Every time I start the game it freezes on the white screen and I have to alt tab and back to get into the menus.
You finally get to join a game and fps jumps from 144 to 30 and back all the time for no apparent reason.
Key bindings and mouse sensitivity randomly resets to default in the middle of a match.
"
14285,"This game is probably the best F2P game on Steam.
The graphics are amazing, even on its lowest setting.
The game runs smoothly, even on my laptop which is nowhere near a gaming laptop.
The gameplay? A surprisinly active community, fun challenge, and NO MICROTRANSACTIONS. I've seen people with special items and though, ""Wow, I wish I had that, but its not worth the $15 it probably is.
That wasn't an issue though, because I saw it in the shop with a reasonable in-game currency price. In-game currency, by the way, is soley earned and not bought.
This game is truly incredible. It is a hidden gem, underappreciated, and really addictive. I suggest you get it; its free. What have you got to lose?"
14286,nice
14287,ABSOLUTELY DEAD BALANCE SYSTEM BTW :))))))))
14288,5/5
14289,Good
14290,"good range of weapons, and game modes. all ya need is some Australian servers and your're set!!"
14291,"its good

"
14292,"Worst movement ive ever seen, why it has to be so fast. you dont need skills at all just run right left spray and pray, if u are lucky you will get a kill. also you can't report cheaters in game! Dont waste your time here, warface is much better and more new fps games are coming very soon."
14293,"This game is great.
I personally think that there should be less grenade launchers."
14294,"Oh, this is an amazing game 9/10 and its free to play :D"
14295,"A decent shooter; rewards good play and is not pay to win. It can get rather grindy, but generous boosts and gifts come often enough to alleviate the grind. The shooting is very fast paced and arcadey, CS veterans would feel right at home. Gameplay, especially in TDM mode, feels a lot as if CoD and CS had a kid and it became Black Squad. It has great optmization, too, running at 100+ fps on Ultra using a potato laptop.

Honestly not a bad game. Since it's free, why not give it a try? If you like the game, you can shell out some cash for some cosmetics to show off with.

One bad thing is that the server locations are limited. This may change as the game moves through Early Access, so keep your fingers crossed."
14296,"its very bad, more than csgo but for a free game its ok
"
14297,Meh.
14298,"Good game
"
14299,"to play this game, you have to sweat the FPS genre."
14300,non pay to win game super fun.
14301,"I would recommmend the game based on it being a decent shooter for free. In light of things though, it seems to have the same frustrating nonsense you get with COD. The achievements are a plus as that will keep me playing on and off for a little while, but on a rating scale in my personal opinion, I would score the game about a 6.5/10. 

"
14302,+++
14303,"the game is good on itself, good graphics, fast gameplay, and balanced gun system. hopefully this wont be a P2W game on the long run. The Competitive mode isn't so competitive at all because there is no Voice Chat, and the team arent so balance at all, sometimes you happen to be on the Overpowered team and sometimes you happen to be on the bad team, in almost every competitive match i played someone always quit. Please make some more severe penalties for the ""quitters"" like banning them for 24 hours a week or even a month so they stop quitting."
14304,"Well I like this one, better than CSGO"
14305,competetive matches doesnt work
14306,"First game that doesnt make me aggresive. :)


Edit : I lied"
14307,Nice
14308,#DEADGAME!!!
14309,9/11 would play.
14310,Do yu know de way?
14311,"Great game for low end laptops, you will have to turn all the graphics down but the game still looks fairly good."
14312,Great game! If your looking for a game with a mix of csgo and call of duty than this is the right game.
14313,"Good , but Cheaters :/ please fix this problem"
14314,"Got scammed by making all my skins unmarketable permanently with just a day notice...
Greedy and selfish developers are killing the game.."
14315,Pls don't add weapons with fantasy in it its fucking silly its 2018 retards
14316,Just No.
14317,plzz add drop gun
14318,give me a 10k bs plz
14319,"The game is pretty fun and use BE as AC so almost no cheater.
Problem is random spray patters. This really bring the game down..."
14320,This Game and CS GO The Best
14321,"Are you looking for a FPS shooter that is even worse then CSGO WELL YOUR IN LUCK THIS GAME HAS I T ALL
-BAD MAPS!
-3 USEBLE GUNS AT LEVEL 4
-UNBALENCED MM
-GOOD PING!
-ANUSVOCHT!
-Rage along with your friends 

10/10"
14322,"Everytime I attempt to press play to start the game, it crashes causing my game to be ready to play. I've tried closing and opening steam, and restarting my PC. Nothing works
["
14323,"to clunky, way to pay 2 win"
14324,"Granades are everywhere, maps are poorly designed and just weird, just buy csgo it is better in any aspect"
14325,"Yo this game is stupidly garbage. Coming back once a month to only bring back the old memories, but aye, they are pretty much gone, the fun is gone. Thanks to the new developers for making it worse. You guys at VALOFE are really good at making a bad game even worse! wohooo yes remove 5 stack or Duo in Comp, remove all rewards and add stupidly overpriced ugly skins. Was a good game until the devs started ruining it"
14326,yeah i like these game....
14327,Good game
14328,"-pros
2$ knife
fun to play
 -cons
5 diamond star vs 5 random silver (unbalanced matchmaking)
servers are not good enough






i only recommend this game for 2$ shiny super hot fade huntman knife.."
14329,discount cs
14330,white screen only
14331,best free game
14332,Black squad ban me for cheating(and i don't even cheat in this game)
14333,Toxic community ...
14334,excellent game
14335,Good Game Call of Duty + CSGO = Black Squad
14336,P2W Guns
14337,Very good Army Sim game
14338,"This game is super fun and completly free to play. There are loot crates that can give you skins and various knives similar to CSGO. One complaint I have with this game is that many of the guns in the game simply are not good. When you compare the stats of most guns, theres really no reason to use anything but a few of the top stat guns. Thats not to say that there isnt a good set of intresting weapons. Another problem is the small number of maps for each game mode. TDM is my personal favorite mode but only 5 or so of the games maps are used in this mode. Why not all of them? Hopefully as the game leaves early accesse mode more maps will be added into the pool

The game also has a very good size playerbase, you'll never have trouble getting into a lobby for any gamemode. So dont worry about long que times. Overall the game is amzing and would be worth a a 15-20 dollar price tag SO the fact that its free is awesome.

"
14339,"Don't bother playing this game.It is trash,community toxic,there are cheaters.This game is already dead and it deserves to die. Competitive isn't even competitive, countless cheaters, I can't even sell skins I have anymore for some reason.

Developers just deserve to die."
14340,"With good update and free DLC to support players like this game, no doubt this will be a great free 2 play shooter game"
14341,In my opinon I love this game even though it is mainly a rip off from CS:GO and CoD. However getting past that it comes with new guns and skins and such things. It is getting updated constantly and it does allow for competive play and also casual play. This is why I love the game minus the fact that somehow in the past month I have gotten extremly to point and shoot games. (Kinda) Otherwise this game gets a thumbs up from me.
14342,"Böyle oyunun anasını karısını sikeyim. Yapımcıların şuandan itibaren bacılarını sikeyim. Zırt pırt her 10dk da bir ping yüzünden kick atıyor. Allah belanızı versin, eliniz ayağınız kırılsın bir daha klavyeye dokunamayın. Sülalenizin tanıdığınız insanların göt deliğini folloş edeyim. İmanınızı da sikeyim."
14343,"game play : 10/10
graphics : 7/10
ui : 6/10
pricing : 12345890/10
if you cant start playing this game and not whine about campers then get good"
14344,"One of the best Free-to-Play games out there. And a very good FPS in it's own right too. 

Black Squad looks great, runs smooth with high refresh rates, has an awesome selection of guns and it's shooting mechanics feel good too. This underated gem gives CS:GO and COD both a run for their money. And it's free. Getting into a populated game has never been a problem, and the firefights are satisfying. The only cons are that movement can feel sluggish compared to current AAA games, the audio design is a bit lackluster, the menu UI is a bit clunky, and it's needs some more maps. It would be nice to see more frequent updates as well. 

For free, this game is a can't miss. It's a blend of modern aesethic and style with old school twitch FPS roots."
14345,Hey...
14346,"Honestly this game is fill with campers in TDM. But also the matches be unbalance too and just unfair for the people that are new to the game. The severs are just not that great at all, and the gameplay is okay and hit reg is just competely ass. Takes a whole magazine to take another player down and also headshots. I have shot players in the head and yet they are still alive and manage to get me. I really don't understand the damage and hit reg with players. Game is great, but severs and unbalance game is just awful. Hopfully things can change and make matchmaking more fair to new players."
14347,Not CSGO.
14348,Best game ever really fun the startup menu is a little messy and the lobby is a little messy but once you get into a online mach its really badass
14349,fun
14350,"the best game :DD
"
14351,is just game
14352,pretty addicting game
14353,Well this game has some future.
14354,dab
14355,this game is a poorly balanced p.o.s. the developers clearly have no idea how grenades work one a grenade detonating next two a human being will tear them to pieces but in this game the damage is so small it might as well might not even be used and to cooking a grenade is non existant as ive cooked a grenade for 5 seconds! 2 seconds longer than the army training manual suggested if i wanted to remain among the living and tossed it and watched as the person i wanted to receive my ire and his entire squad had a full 5 FUCKING seconds to move and get out the blast radius yeah that is the way they think grenades work oh and lets get to grenade launchers ive fired a grenade launcher at the feet of humans and watched as it did less than a quarter of their hp mmmm hmmm people once again organic beings comprised of meat and bone are capable of tanking something that can punch holes through walls. ive used a g36 assault rifle one of the most accurate rifles in the world know for its minimal recoil and respectable fire power do such piss poor damage and have the recoil of a shotgun in this game they belive that anything thats not a damn sniper rifle or smg must have recoil that will climb to the roof and barely damage your opponent meanwhile sniper rifles will one shot you no matter were your hit a desert eagle will after shooting the person 4 times in the FACE not kill someone but a nine millimeter will 2 shot you and smgs will tear entire teams apart. but an m4a1 a rifle that is the mainstay rifle of the us armed forces has the recoil of an lmg and the damage of a pistol yeah thats accurate. this game and its developers have alot of work to do before this game is remotely acceptable to even compete with games like battlefield one and counter strike go. in short 5/10 get your stuff together and do your homework
14356,i love this weird ass shooter! beta tested it back when it launched in north america.
14357,Really fast paced pretty fun but the flinch when you shoot people is honestly ridiculous the guy looks like hes playing limbo or something.
14358,"yeah nice game tbh i play it alot like alot its the best game!
"
14359,Fantastic game.. A  great CS:GO/BF&COD hybrid.. And a game I think should be an MLG comp game. Very good mechanics and tons of evenly balanaced weapons that aren't paid for. All you've gotta do is play for awhile and then you'll have access to good firepower. I've seemed to be placed in balanced games against equally skilled opponents in games since i've started. Not playing against over powered pro's.
14360,nice game beautiful maps it have a future
14361,"While the game itself can be fun, it is ruined by horrible balance system. More often than not if you choose to play Demolition games you will run into premade groups which not only have the advantage of better communication/co-ordination but more often than not they are also significantly more experienced.

The game goes out of its way to make the game tilted towards one team or the other. Given that there is no downside to leaving, thankfully, you can just get out of the match. There is also a convoluted currency system with not one, not two but 4 different currencies. Why did they need 4? only the Devs can tell. 

There are a lot of free boxes that can give useful items such as Gold (currency type 1) or Medals (currency type 2) along with time grenades but more often than not you will end up getting timed calling cards which are merely banners. When you do get grenades its very likely that they will be 1 day duration."
14362,"It was a good game in the early stages of it's existence. But later on when the game got a new dev team everything went downwards. The game has a lot of cheaters, who are ignored by the developers and BattlEye Anti-cheat rarely detect hacks.

I spent so much of life playing this game (3 years), later on when Valofe took over (Oct 2020) they changed the game completely. They just do updates like bringing in new skins, to milk money out of you. And they have banned and still banning a lot of legit players that never used any sort of hacks, which caused a decrease in the player-base. Servers feel like it's 10 tick you get a lot of noregs (not registering shots) even with low ping.

The game have a lot of good potential but with lack of management it won't grow or will soon be dead."
14363,"Easy Game
"
14364,no
14365,"Game is really good, rather play this than csgo. Some things could be changed: stop the fucking man from saying ""RELOAD"" everytime, the sniper scope zooms way too far for one with an ever closer scope. other things definitely could be added but this is all i can think of. 8.5/10"
14366,Still a good game.
14367,"Great FPS! love the game play, the only issue ive found right now is the game will force close will waiting for a match to start. Can be irritating at times but i just started to play tonigh. i stilll highly recommed the game and i will keep on playing!"
14368,"This game is Bloody Awesome! I'll love it, it is challenging to work with the Controls but yet it is Fun ^^. If only I can post this on My YouTube channel so I can Tell Everybody and eveyone even They know You're here however, yet this is Amazing."
14369,crashed my pc twice when ajusting to correct res....
14370,"Change the matchmaking system. I get you wanna make money off of gullible idiots who think buying shit will make them better, but I want a fair game please. None of this high rank vs. low rank crap I've been seeing."
14371,Feels like an unpolished unfun csgo clone
14372,"[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/32296668-Casual-Game-Reviews/]More reviews on our Curator Page[/url]

[b]Black Squad[/b] is one of the most popular traditional Online First Person Shooters on Steam at this moment, and although is not as popular as the king of Multiplayer action, [b]Counter Strike[/b], it sure has gathered an interesting amount of players.
Originally released on Steam exactly one year ago, the story behind [b]Black Squad[/b] goes away earlier, when was formerly launched back in 2013 in South-Korea. The original concept went through some major changes, to adopt a more realistic modern warfare.

With a short and simple tutorial, even newcomers can join this modern warfare multiplayer First Person Shooter, that’s filled with adrenaline!
The concept is simple; two teams entitled [u]Viper Circle[/u] and [u]Peacemaker[/u], fight each other across multiple modes and maps, while earning Experience points to increase their ranks.
Each player has a military rank that advances accordingly, and the more XP gathered, the further one goes.
The team behind the game made one thing clear, there won’t be any Pay-To-Win elements, and so far their promise seems valid! Lootboxes however, are one of the more proftible ways [i]NS STUDIO[/i] can earn their share!
Players earn free credits, but can also use real money to purchase Black Squad Bullets, in order to purchase special crates that may or may not contain the desired weapon or Black Squad coins, the premium currency for rare items. Although, in-game currency such as Credits and Medals can be used to unlock weapons, some limited skins and even a couple of extras to extend the customization!

Exactly one year later, [b]Black Squad[/b] is still in Early Access, and with peaks between 5 to 10 thousand players online every day, where does this game stands at in 2018?
In pretty good shape one would say, but there’s always room for improvement. Using Unreal Engine 3, it’s an open door for both players on budget desktops, and high ending ones, plus, the current options allow its user a tremendous optimization.

Specific in-game options such as Character, Backgrounds, Lightning Effect, Shadows, Effects, and Physics range from Very Low - Low - Medium - High - Ultra, to help you reach the performance you most desire in a competitive game, but many other options are available. Limiting the framerate, Virtual Sync, Anti-Aliasing, Thread Sync and Refresh rate is something players can change accordingly.
Other extra visual options are included such as Gun Trail Effect, Color Filters, and even Blood Effect, where gamers who are sensitive to blood, can replace the red with white, for a much different experience. Crossfire experts will have a great time, as they are custom-built, in size, shape and color. Mouse and overall keys are customized for both click and pressing options, and that’s rare even for new released games!

Visually, it’s extremely pleasant going through each map, either under a clear blue sky, or a night at the docks filled with neon lights. Objects and structures are simple but very well designed, perfect for those who are always visually attracted to the game’s goodies.
Maps are somehow inspired by real locations such the Avignon, inspired by a french city, and they have a fantastic light work. Each area is unique and has its very unique style and artisticapproach over war sceneries.
It’s somehow a breath of fresh air to see Unreal Engine 3 being used with a dedicated color palette, even in 2018!
Map design offers all sorts of play style, with different weapons. Each map as a perfect sniping spot, or a runway down for assault rifles. Other maps such as the VBSS, a level based on a cruiser, have plenty of hiding spots for campers or just overall sneaking players!

With fantastic set of options that were added through this past year to please gamers worldwide, servers across the globe were also progressively added, even if Australia still needs one, how does the gameplay stands out you may wonder? It’s a tremendous experience, very fluid, and much pleasant. If the gameplay was all it took, [b]Black Squad[/b] would be a serious competitor to [b]Counter Strike[/b], but a lot of things influence it, including the netcode, which is solid and responsive, yet it needs improvement. Technical glitches are still present though, but for a small team under 10 employees, [b]Black Squad[/b] has been almost outstanding!

[b]Black Squad[/b] has five game modes. Team Death Match, where two teams of 8 players each fight in rounds of 10 minutes, or maximum kills of 150, where the team with more kills win.
Demolition is another classic mode, where one team must place the explosive, and the other must defuse it. This mode has up to 12 players each side.
Such as Demolition, in Assassination mode, killed players cannot join the session, and as one team must kill the VIP, and the other must protect it, in a match up to 8 vs 8 players.
The final mode called Destruction places two teams, up to 16 players each side, on a large map with destructible objects available in strategic places. The team who destroys the most, earns the most, and the final team to accumulate more points win. This mode as another variant where one team attacks a specific spot, and the other team protects it.
Across all these modes, players can customize their preferences in specific maps and a set of rules, creating a different approach for each mode and guns! doesn’t want to do a malee-only-match on a gladiator arena? Yes, it is possible!

Maps have been added halfway through this last year, but they seem to come to an end, and their management has changed as well. Across the 30 maps available, locations such as Dust Shield were removed from Team Death Match to become a Demolition exclusive! This happened a few times, and pretty much defined Team Death Match as a frenetic, fastpaced action, where most players won’t be able to rest, not even for a second!

Weaponry is pretty much of what one would expect of a [b]Counter Strike[/b] competitor. A large amount of Assault Rifles, SMG’s. Sniper Rifles for all sizes and preferences, a couple of Shotguns and Designated Marksman Rifles, another couple of Light Machine Guns, a handful of Pistols and of course, one Smoke, Flash and Frag grenade.
Weapons have great detail, and the recoil has been updated since the early phases of the game’s launch on Steam. The community has spoken and was listening pretty fast considering this version of Black Squad, is at this point, a much more realistic from the original one.

We can’t be sure of its future, but one thing is certain. With no Pay-To-Win elements, and a good amount of maps, [b]Black Squad[/b] will continue to bring new players into the genre through the Free to Play factor.
A permanent ban must be implanted, and further character customization needs to step forward, in order to attempt to gain Steam Marketplace attention, with a wide sort of cosmetic items.
DLC seems to be a reasonable source of profit, and exclusive skins and character packs for a substantial amount of money could be a great improvement.

Whatever happens, [b]Black Squad[/b] will always be a great experience for what asks of you, which is nothing but dedication and practice. As a Free to Play title, it’s a must for anyone looking for a competitive multiplayer shooters."
14373,NICE GAME
14374,10 minutes of disappointment leads to ALT+F4
14375,"A Great game, good graphics, low to medium system requirements, great gameplay really cool guns.
I would recommend"
14376,nice balance
14377,Gameplay very good
14378,good
14379,Its counterstrike for free Nothing special
14380,"Very easy to learn and graphics are actually quite nice. Enjoyed this game very much, probably even more than CS:GO."
14381,"This is like a cross of CSGO and COD but people are not as toxic. Right now we got a boat load of goodies for the 1 year anniversary ,so you dont have to buy everything! high pingers get kicked out automatically.
Lots of weapons to play with but they only offer few maps, better hit reg that COD. 
Best of all  you dont feel like someone robbed you in 3 months when the hype of the new COD wears out."
14382,super good game it isnt p2w you can get every weapon on the game exept ak zhukov
14383,"This thing has more of good cod feelings than any of post-cod4 actual COD games. By that alone you can forgive abysmall visuals, 1997 era sound effects and rail-type moving. 

What is clearly bad is their movement system and keybindings. We can only hope they manage to sort this things out."
14384,Black Squad is better than csgo
14385,It's verey nice
14386,"UPDATED. Pay to Win is really starting to show.

All of the cash shop wepons are way more powerful and yes you can earn them without paying a dime but it takes time and meanwhile you are fighting a whole team with the best weapons they just paid for while you slug it out trying to earn enough gold to buy them. 

A single sniper rifle costs 192k gold, you earn about 1k or less per round won. Or you can just buy it. See what I mean? 

Its a fun game dont get me wrong and I enjoy playing it, but go into it knowing its pay to win."
14387,Black Squad is on the frontpage of Top Selling F2P games but they can't even afford a decent anti cheat or to make an ingame reporting system.
14388,So Goood.
14389,please add kick players and report them in game (not in lobby)
14390,I like game andd i look azwesome
14391,The call of duty feel without the price tag.
14392,"Nice game for what it is. 
High securety issues. 
Probably really fun in private matches with ppl you know.
People who played AVA will know the payne of playing vs Hakers.
Have fun!"
14393,"The game at it's best is pretty fun. It's just like most fps games: hackers, P2W skins, sometimes-toxic community  - a game you can enjoy without taking it seriously. I really recommend a high end PC for this game, because if you don't have one, once in a while the game will bug. BUT, most of the time the game is gonna be a rough ride (If you are the average gamer like me). All the bugs are killing this game at this point. The community is ok, gameplay is pretty good, big variety of guns (except some are basically obsolete at this point), etc. Devs don't really listen to the community until it's too late, based on what they have been doing for the last 2 years. Game has been nicknamed DeadSquad and SkinSquad, and to a degree, it's true, but if you can take all the BS, not gonna lie it's a game you can enjoy."
14394,Great game! 5 stars!
14395,THE GAME UNFORTUNATELY FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT WAS HAPPY WITH THE GRAPHICS (VERY RUDIMENTARY) AS WELL AS THE CONTROL OF THE WEAPONS IS BAD.
14396,"The only thing I can say is that this game has potential, but without Oceanic servers I won't be revisiting it again any time soon."
14397,good
14398,:)
14399,"Played one game on TDM, feels like playing an old gen FPS. Prefer CS:GO."
14400,"Good maps, easy to get into, lot of different game modes, not pay to win, free."
14401,crap
14402,:)
14403,"Very good game its fun to play Dm, i would be happy if they add more guns :) also this is must download n play game and also its free :) so try this if u love Fps and it also has Many maps."
14404,"I will only recommend this otherwise great game if the developers address the constant (evey 10 seconds or so) fps stutters that I get in this game on medium and lowest quality settings, even after a fresh reboot.  (Other titles like overwatch, for example, run smoothly even on high settings)"
14405,"Competetive game there is a bull*shit, you are always play 4 v 5 due to afk, leaver, banned player. ALWAYS (5 out of 5 times)! There is no quick surrender, no bots you can play for, no ""encouragements"" for playing in the minority. You on the 1st place and trying to win at first 4 v 5 ('cause 1 got banned) then 3 v 5 ('cause leaver)? Developers DON'T GIVE A SH*IT. This game will NEVER be compepetive with system like this. For now it's bad clone of CS:GO suitable only for playing for fun. No more."
14406,"Thought I'd give it a go. Here's my 25 minutes. 

The whole experience was nauseating. The training mission was annoying and constantly interrupting me as I played it. The music is obnoxious. I won't even start on the standard keybindings the game forces you to try by blocking off the settings tab in the pause menu. Is it hard just using the usual FPS keybindings? They're not re-inventing the wheel here. 

Then the UI. Probably the worst I have encountered in any modern FPS game. Especially a free one. Constant pop ups, messages, tasks, drops, blah blah blah. Absolute mess. It really needs tidying up. And do they really need THREE currencies? Whats wrong with the usual two? 

There's probably a half decent FPS in here somewhere but for the life of me I could not fathom another second with this game to bother trying it out. First impressions are key and this game repulsed me immedietly."
14407,"By far the greatest creation man has ever made. I love it when you win the game and the ""win"" screen comes on. I also love the art style of a knockoff call of duty game it has. 11/10 will tac reload again."
14408,"What I disliked, obviously aim botters in this, you get 1 shot before you can get a shot but takes you 5 shots to kill someone? makes no sense to me, however it is free and early access maybe it will get better if they remove the cheats soon enough before others get disgusted with it also."
14409,great game to be free to play. fun time waster and a big break from the more intense games
14410,Worst game i have ever played!
14411,hardcore fps
14412,Good Game
14413,worst shooter i have played i'll just leave it at that
14414,this game is garbage. Worst fps i have ever played

14418,"Only a few hours into the game, lots of fun though! Weapon skins, sounds and mods are pretty realistic. Can be pretty fast paced depending on the scenario you're playing. The currency system can be confusing... I like how you receive upgrades/skins and currency the more you play.  It doesn't seem to create much of of a gap between veteran players and noobs though which is interesting.

Can't wait for more people to get into this game!

Only concern right now is the wait time in between matches.. seems like it's hard to get into a match and I can't seem to find a server list.

Highly recommended though, lots of fun!"
14419,"Boring gameplay, and another call of duty clone that fails to capture my attention."
14420,"i mean i guess its good i like it but, well i dont really know hhow to rate this game soo eh, i like it"
14421,:D
14422,"TLDR: Imagine that each map has a Path A, Path B, Path C to get around. Spawn. Pick one. Rush it or Camp it. Thats the game.

Only played quickmatch TDM but my inital reaction is:

Pros:
Good mechanics / Gunplay
Play-to-unlock weapons.

Cons:
Map layouts are incredibly small and bland. 
Very limited pathways and lines of sight. - Compounded with how small the maps are, the gameplay becomes boring very quickly.

14430,Fast paced with lots of different weapons to chose from and it's FREE.
14431,Updated into oblivion and no longer playable
14432,"TL;DR: don't play this if you're looking to put a decent amount of hours into a game and play a little more serious than casual, the service is horse crap, the community is also crap, the gameplay is ok.
(it's mainly the service by the devs and mods that is just absolutely unforgiveable.)

This game is a mixture of hell yea and no, here's my opinion on it speaking only from my point of view and my experiences with this game.

First off, the game's pretty ok to play.
-Not much variety in guns but hey it's better than CS in that scenario altho there's a obvious handful of guns to use that are simply better than anything else.
-It's got good networking although in a patch a little while ago it seems that sometimes you would shoot the person in the head but nothing happens, instead you get fragged.
-It's got fun little events for you to strife and complete to get some rewards, like nice guns, callsigns and in-game currency.

Having written down my last point here's what frustrates me;
the support is utter shite,  I've been grinding for a reward a little while now and that is to make it to top 100 in ranking before the 18th of july and you would get a callsign, pistol and enough in-game currency to buy yourself another skin on a weapon.
I was told the rank system broke 2/3 weeks ago and thus it's frozen, so currently it says i'm 92nd in the rankings right? which obviously is top 100 but given the benefit of the doubt I could be above that now. HOWEVER, the rewards should've been set in stone for all attendees on the 18th which is a little over 2 weeks ago. On the 18th i was still in the top 80 as I've checked to see if I was eligable for the rewards.
I go to their website, get pointed to Discord, Discord mod bashes me for being frustrated, player is nice enough to let me know to write a ticket, now I have to wait until after the weekend for the ticket to be answered.
Now this is all fine and dandy but if a Discord mod on the OFFICIAL DISCORD for this game bashes me for being frustrated at THEIR mistakes wtf kind of service is that? This game gets a FAT thumbs down for me after pouring a decent couple of hours into it, the service is wack and they have no clue what they're doing. Fun for casual players but if you're looking to spend some good time in a fps and take it slightly more serious, don't waste your time here."
14433,"Its not bad. It feels like a very basic shooter in the vein of Modern Warfare. No real pay-to-win elements, however hit detection seems a bit off (at least when I played) and TTK is just frankly too high. If you want this game, download Ironsight instead. Miles better"
14434,This is not a very good game
14435,FU
14436,just ask your mum to buy you cod
14437,EWW EWW EWW. just play ironsight.
14438,Found my COD replacement
14439,"Fun, tactical, pretty fast-paced, wide variety of guns. But the game is filled with cheaters-hackers. Wallhacks, Aimbots, Triggerbots, ESPs, etc. The assault rifles bullet spread/spray is very inconsistant, it can be hard to tell if it's recoil/bullet spread not allowing the shots to register, or if it's just a poor hit detection system/inconsistant hitboxes. And the developers, from the patches in the last year, don't seem to be focusing on/patching on ANY of these potential Gameplay issues nor the exploitation of their Anti-Cheat System. Black Squad cheating-hacking was such an issue in the Tournament's alone, that they had to implement another Anti-Cheat System alongside/in tandum with BattlEye's Anti-Cheat System. That's how bad the cheating-hacking is though, that there are numerous players banned even during Tournaments. I don't even think players from what I've seen CAN be banned from queueing for Quick Match, cause I've seen someone blatantly walling or botting, get ""Kicked"" by BattlEye Anti-Cheat for blatantly using, then they'll have rejoined and be back in the game/lobby the very next round doing the same thing, lol.

TL;DR, Good game with a lot of potential, but needs bigger maps, more maps, more consistant bullet spread and/or hit detection system for assault rifles, and most of all, a functional and effective Anti-Cheat System
3.8/10"
14440,I've had more fun with this game in less than 2 hours than I had with 8 years of Counter Strike
14441,Good
14442,"I've played Black Squad for over 10 hours now and I've greatly enjoyed the experience. I come from a competitve FPS background in games like Soldier of Fortune, Wolf ET, Quake and Quake Wars Enemy Territory - all fast based hip firing games and it's great to see a game where camping and using Iron Sights isn't necessary. 

A quick side note on cheating - Despite a large outcry that this game is full of cheaters, I just don't see it. In fact after only having played for a few hours, I happened to kill 3 people in a row and was immeditely called a cheater. No consideration was taken for the fact that I've been playing computer games competitvely for over 20 years, just the fact that I was low rank and apparently doing well (not that well IMO). 

I just happen to have a set of decent 7.1 surround audio headphones because sound and awarness are key in this game. Using a silencer will keep you from popping up on the enemy's radar, and walking, and crouch dropping from heights will prevent you from making extremely loud foodsteps and movement noises. 

Pros:
Free to Play and not Pay to Win. 
Fast paced - Hip firing possible. 
Balanced maps and variety in game modes. 
In built support for clans. 
Good netcode. 
Combat is fun, simple and addictive. 
Game is being actively supported and updated. 

Cons: 
No dedicated servers.
Lack of Voice chat."
14443,Great War
14444,It's okay.
14445,"This game is pretty good. Perhaps a spiritual succesor to crossfire and combat arms. Its great for a f2p game. Guns are pretty easy to get and there is no pay wall. In a way, I wish there was, because I played this game for a day and already unlocked everything I will ever need. 

I do wish that they had a fun mode like ghost mode, or mutant mode."
14446,meh
14447,10/10 would sprint with mmb again
14448,good a little wonky
14449,"BS was a really fun game during my time but honestly... I don't really recommend it anymore haha TT

Imo.... it's a good and fun game to try out but I wouldn't say it's worth maining or really diving into like for other games like tf2 or dota or csgo or paladins etc. Consider this game a side game kinda like l4d2 or whatever else. Casual fun~

Here's a simple pros and cons chart I'll make~
------------
Pros~

- Weapons are all relatively balanced~ So first of all... there is a system where you earn medal currency vs gold currency. Medal currency cannot be bought at all and is only gained through naturally playing the game/grinding... however you want to call it. Anyways~ statistically these guns are seemingly better but that's not quite the case. M4 Custom is statistically better than the MDR but the MDR is way easier to control and spray etc. A lot of other guns work that way too but... the last update I was around was when they added the RUS something gun that 3hko/4hkos. But every gun is generally special with its own scope or ammo clip size or recoil and spread. There isn't ever a case where a gun directly overshadows another even though yes.... there are some guns better than others imo. 

ARs + snipers > all of the other weapon classes like machine guns and shotguns and smgs etc. That's the only imbalanced part of the weapons in the game but all snipers and all rifles are equally viable~

- Very easy to pick up and fun gameplay~ it's a lot of run and gun stuff so it's super casual and easy to get into. Recoil is super easy to control with tapfiring... bursting... etc. Like very easy and nice game mechanics with fast kills at 3 to 5 shots. It just has a really fun gameplay to it with how guns and movement work. You can also and should shoot while moving at full speed since accuracy while moving isn't penalized drastically at all.

- Slight gaming purpose/motive with kdr and win rates haha. Not a big deal but it kinda helps give some drive to improve.
------------
Cons~

- TDM maps are way too small and become chokepoint issues. Maps are symmetrical at least but yeah... super small and not quite fun.

- Destruction game mode has the best maps imo due to their sizes and it accomodates 16 vs 16 players. But~ game balancing issues occur there with perks so like... claymores... sentry guns... etc. Think of this mode as like... tf2 version of black squad but it lacks a lot of balance but I ended up playing this the most due to the decent maps.

- Demolition mode runs into a lot of issues with how actively powerful and fast snipers are along with run and gun mechanics. Imo... csgo makes way better use of this same game mode. Run and gunning with limited respawns and needing to plant bombs etc leads to really silly games and it's less on tactic and strategies and positioning and more on raw aiming. If that's your thing you'll love BS but if you want more depth.... stick to csgo.

- Player count... as of lately has been super bad. It's hard to find a game except for demolition mode. Be prepared for super long queues and games to be only 6 v 6 etc which works in demo mode but in others... it's not fun.

- Gets super repetitive. Run and gun can be fun but it starts getting mindless. Unlike tf2 and dota and paladins where there's so much depth and variety at every game... a game in BS feels like the same as the one before it and so on. Super dry and repetitive after a while and run and gun also has issues of like... players overly dominating etc since it's not about positioning but just pure aim wars. This is ultimately why I stopped playing it along with it being impossible to find full games. It just gets so dull and it doesn't feel like... there's much improvement you can do besides aim better. Like there's not much game decision making to improve on and it becomes more like... I just need to hit better shots.

For more relaxed gamers who want to just run and gun that works out well though but yeah. There's not much depth compared to other games as the ones I keep mentioning haha.

- Slight grind/pay to win in terms of visual min maxing. There are female character models that can be gotten after playing for a super long time and getting lucky with events or saving up or outright buying them. Same hit box but they're visually a bit smaller than male character models. So... not a big deal and it won't affect your aim if you're already decent at aiming but it does add a slight unfair element but hey~ better than an op gun that's behind a paywall etc. 
-----------
Verdict~

Fun game to play super casually and to go in for a few rounds. But I personally don't see this game worth any deeper investments. Try it out if you're bored and want to spice up things and try a new fps game but... you'll find yourself quickly running back to other games especially if you're the type like me who prefers having games to kinda main and to really improve at etc~

Not exactly a bad game at all but I can't recommend it as like.... anything more special and if you're wondering if this is a new game to main... no it isn't. It's just a fun casual game to add when you need to take a break from a game or want to try new ones out etc.

I don't regret the hours I've put in and the fun I've had though and even the dollar I spent in it. But I just can't openly recommend it as a game everyone should play and definitely have etc. Just try it out if curious but nothing more~"
14450,"Better than CS:GO and Rainbow Six Siege combined.

14452,مرحبا انا قمت في تحميل العبة لكن لم تتتحمل كاملً ارجو الاطلاع على هاذا الامر وشــــــــــــــــــــــــــكرا
14453,its good
14454,Very yes.
14455,"Tbh it is your typical f2p shooter but without the p2w. The game it self runs smooth and had pretty decent graphics for a shooter in the f2p world. There are claims of being crap ton of hackers but in reality you can be one shotted if shot in the head and as well you can to. The game uses a automatching feature so far from what I have seen and that has pros and cons. I am more of a server list person myself. This still dosent take away from the game at all though. The game really dosent have a huge learning curve to it, you can just jump in and go shoot people which in some cases people would like. I know I got low play time but Black Squad is worth the download and worth at least a shot. If you play other games this one is great to jump to and just kill stuff for a bit and have fun."
14456,Good game . But u need to pay some streamers to play and add map for compe
14457,"This game need some balancing, it seems like there is no weapon that takes more than 3 shots to kill"
14458,"Great fps if you like sileced kills and losing 20 hours of time on ques

14459,"Hacker infested, if you play you need to contribute with reports and videos of every game hackers cuz anti-cheat does nothing. FULL OF HACKERS!

I'm truly sorry that I spent this much time in this game! A true waste of time!

I uninstalled this crap."
14460,Better than CS:GO
14461,Great Game!!!!
14462,Warning bad grammar up ahead: this game is very competitive its actually a really great game and can people stop compairing and start appreciating the game instead
14463,"My favorite free to play FPS alongside Warface. Doesn't take a whole lot to run and I can play it on my potato i3 laptop with minimal lag. Balanced guns and gunplay that you won't find on nearly any other free to play FPS. Overall amazing game.

EDIT:
As of 1 September, 2018, this game has gone down the drain. They recently released a new map and 2 guns (which are poop). The map is only a TDM map, so that tells you something. The fact that it took a whole year for them to add another map other than Sabotage really says something about the devs. 

""So where has all the money we spent on boxes and keys gone"" You may ask?
Well I'll tell you what it HASN'T gone towards:

1) A working anti-cheat
2) Better Maps
3) Better servers
4) Worthwhile improvements to the base system of the game

Man, this game had so much potential. I loved it for the short time I played it when it first came out and then when I came back to it, but its flaws outshine it's strengths.

Back to CS:GO. At least there the cheaters can get reported."
14464,top fps  wp
14465,"Wow. Got to admit, Yes this is free. But my good god. I love this game. I cannot get enough of this. Its way better than any Call Of Duty ''In my Opinion anyways''. It reminds me alot like csgo. Very good game this is and i enjoy it alot :-)"
14466,"I really wish this game had more people to play with, and well... the Frame rate is TERRIBLE!  It has great graphics, models are nice, love the weapons!  TAR-21 makes me Happy!

To me seems like the game was using models designed for an Engine like Unreal Engine 4, but its using the engine designed for Half-Life 1?  I have a monster machine giving me average 150fps in most games.. this game I couldn't get over 21fps on VERY LOW SETTINGS.. But oddly even at the ULTRA setting I still got 21fps.  Is the game locked at that frame rate for any particular reason or what?

The Sound Effects are a only ok, some guns sound like Airsoft guns :P

Anyway, fix the Framerate problem and I'd love this game!  Maybe offer more gamemodes using bots?
Still like the game but could use some work.

14471,The game is good but I think that if you add weapons in the shop and reduce the dependence on the boxes a bit will become a better game.
14472,"It's not pay to win. Has good servers and less hacker than any other game. 
Give it a try."
14473,"GREAT game ,great FPS"
14474,"Could be a fun game but filled with a bunch of hackers. Typical. Overall, love the game, but devs, get your shit together and handle these hackers."
14475,"It is not a bad game...not a big title game that can be popular
It is like Combat Arms."
14476,"Been playing since the start, Great Game!!"
14477,"Pros:
- The game mechanics are solid; they feel fluid and functional.
- The weapon selection is good.
- The weapon balance feels correct (damage, speed, accurace, recoil, etc.).

Cons:
- Latency. I'm tired of dying behind walls or seeing the enemies or myself warping around the map.
- A lot of the maps are bland or imbalanced.
- Almost every AR starts with an underbarrel grenade launcher. That many explosions are just annoying, not fun.
- Female characters have smaller hitboxes than male characters.
- No ability to modify weapons (scope, underbarrel attachments, etc.).


I'm only so critical because I have hope for this game."
14478,I recommend it! It doesn't use micro transactions and you credits through the game!

14487,"This game is truly free to play and is entirely skill based. You can practically acquire most of the permanent weapons within a month because there's daily logins with rewards. There's not a single weapon sold like rent. 
The game has good graphics especially if you placed it on DSR. However, they should add options for UI sizes in 4k resolution.
Very similar to the gameplay and game modes of Crossfire and that's expected for Neowiz games. I believe it's not inspired by CoD so please.

The only thing that bothers me is the lack of realism of the guns, bullets are not supposed to come out of the sights but in the gun barrel so this should be improved; any throwables should be permanent and not sold by days because it doesn't make sense, leaning should be added for more tactical realism and prone shall be added in 16vs16 game modes only. 

The UI needs to be reworked because it is very confusing and lackluster.
Boob physics are overrated - female characters should be as tactical as their male counter parts. 
PVE game modes should be added like zombie defense, escape  mode, Death run, and more. 

I'd like to suggest a gun workshop as well. Where players can modify attachments for their weapons. Reloading mechanics should be added as well, like reload animation is cancelled if gun is fired. 

9.0/10 - Game recommended."
14488,amazing game good graphics but the price of bullets are so expensive
14489,awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!...
14490,"Its a very fun free to play time killer. Even if you dont have time to kill, its still a very fun game. But sadly you need to purchase currency in game to purchase better weapons, ubnless you want to grind for 30 hours for one gun."
14491,"Good game. If you like cs go and also enjoy games like COD,BATTLEFIELD. You will enjoy this game for sure. It's like cs go meeting cod/battelfield weapon system. Gameplay is pretty much fun and addictive. Moreover,it's free. So give it a try. Game worth playing."
14492,Bring back the some marketable and tradable skins
14493,"one of the clunkiest mechanics found in a game.

shit hitreg
shit reload mechanics (i.e. when mag has been inserted and reload was interrupted next reload animations should just cock the gun)
shit sound engineering
gunplay is decent, I guess, except when hitreg goes to shit as mentioned above.
at least weapons are not that pay to win
runs decently even on lower-end hardware
overall I think this game tried to mix different mechanics of COD, CSGO, and other free to play competitive shooters not found on steam, such as CrossFire.

Verdict: already own CSGO, don't see any reason as to why keep playing this game.
Might as well consider Rainbow Six Siege instead.

Not to mention some cheaters exist, and SEA server is pure cancer."

14502,"Easy to learn and challenging, but not overwhelming! Community seems fair (rarity nowadays!)

As a casual online player, I often avoid games like CS:GO, Battlefield, as I usually get owned there. But with Black Squad it's different. Very refreshing for a guy, who only plays a few hours per week(!!).

Movement is kinda copied from classic Counter Strike, which I like alot! Shooting mechanics are similar too, but a little more action-oriented, than realistic.

All in all, a recommendable gaming experience, to get into for few hours! The lack of P2W, within the F2P is really well done,  and you almost always find a server (at least for TDM/DE).

It's a cheap ripoff of counter strike and it plays like a cheap mod from 2004. It implies it's a very tactical game, but it's just about rushing to the chokepoints, which already got repetitive in my first match, and spastically strafing whenever there's a firefight. The idea that someone made a game like this anno 2018 is mindblowing. It's like they only ever played counterstrike 1.6 and decided to make a worse copy of that with a store attached to it, not copying anything that's good about shooters of the last 1.5 decade."

I recommend it because It's an amazing FPS game for being free-to-play, and if it becomes pay-to-play, I hope that the people who got it while it was free get to keep it.  I dislike that once you start the game, there's a small range of guns to use, and that you can't customise the sights yourself.  If I could include any ideas in this game, I would have it so tapping C twice will do a dash-slide, and being able to customize the sights/attachments to a preset.  I *LOVE* the modern design, along with the maps.  Another thing I'll recommend is fixing the hit-boxes for either the knives or the characters, because whenever I go on a knifing spree, I miss 3-4 force-stabs when I hit them but it doesen't register.  Overall?  Great game for a Early Access, but has a lot of improving to do!  Get it while you can!"
14532,"fuck ass 
"
14533,Broke bois CSGO
14534,love it
14535,Good game better then csgo now.
14536,"it`s a really fun game to play. It`s F2P so i reall enjoy it.
BUT there are some problems that i hae to complant about are :
1. There still exist an really anoying bug that people ( including me ) getting kick out because of the anti-cheat system. IT KICK people so randomly ad that make this be come really anoying. After getting kick by the anti-cheat system in game my PC always get freeze, crash, ..... [SUPER ANOYING] [ GOT ME TRIGGERED SOMETIME]
2.hackers still !!!!!!!!!

OVERALL, THIS GAME IS  A REALLY FUN AND ENJOYABLE GAME, NOT REALLY STRESSFUL.
edited: Still perty good now."
14537,fun game
14538,GOOD GAME ! AND LIKE CSGO TOO
14539,"The game ""Was"" So great, you can get mostly everything just by spending time on the game, and the skins can also be bought without spending money , I Would have highly Recommended for Blacksquad But No , Why? Here is the problem
Idk if it was my Internet Connection or not, i tried playing Blacksquad from a lots of places , my pc , friends' PCs at their houses , and even at the cafeteria , i keep getting the Errors "" Disconnected from server error 0x0000000 "" and "" An error has occured with the anti cheat program. The game will be restarted."" Even i don't use cheat engine, i tried lots of time Verifying integrity of game files , Uninstall and Reinstall the game N+1 time , but i am still getting these errors from everywhere, through lots of PCs , the others games run so well, and the connection are so good , i will still play the game, since this game is perfect, But the Server connection sucks, The BattleEye's System keep making my game stopped. and these errors happened not only me, but i also search for these errors and saw lots of people from all over the world also got the same problem and they couldnt fix it.
And whenever there is an event that people could collect key to open case by completing 5-10 quick game , most of the time people will just join the game , AFK at the base knifing the wall nonstop just to prevent being kicked from in-actived , or some people just run to the battlefield but not playing, they feed, and feed, and feed, and keep feeding until the match end just to let the game ended faster by letting enemies get enough kills. 
I want the Report button, so that the game will be better with lesser toxic, ruining the game. that would be good"
14540,very nice
14541,shite
14542,The game is too lag
14543,Game full of hackers and its not the same game as it was before
14544,amazeing game and free
14545,best free FPS game...
14546,Best f2p fps shooter in steam so far...
14547,So I wanted to like this game but my biggest complaint is that there is no indication that your team is doing a tactical reload. They really need to implement some voice lines that let you know that someone near you is doing a tac reload over and over and over again. I cant recommend.

Shtty game why?


balance team: or rather inbalance team always screw you up and make you join the noob team with low rank that make you lose instantly 

pay 2 win: basically you need to pay real money to get op guns  100k ingame cash desn't help newbies from these pay 2 win noobs. 

just saying the truth...."
14550,"What a fucking shitty game. 
Bad matchmaking, not THAT MUCH of p2w but pretty fucking bad matchmaking and generally a shitty game."
14551,Love this game ❤
14552,this game is nice
14553,Pretty cool game but you could add more money making metods
14554,just no
14555,Amazing game. amazing gameplay.
14556,so many hackers :| pls check and fix it and ban them like other games ... ty ... thats game completly not bad like old cs :) gj
14557,very bom my amigos
14558,For a Free game this isnt too bad. It's almost as good as some of the COD games that cost $60!
14559,"the game okay it have okay maps that can be a bit bigger 
no fun with small maps 

i can recommend the game but nothing big to why"
14560,good
14561,"Nice game 
i love it"
14562,Better game then csgo !!
14563,eh
14564,"This is the first review I've written and I really don't know what to say but I have been wanting to play this game for a little while I've downloaded it multiple times to try and play but everytime I open the game up my screen is blank everytime and the game doesn't load up, I dont have have a bad computer I have a lot of high spec gear inside but I can't recommend this game because it won't let me play which is a massive shame."
14565,good game.
14566,"You run on default and you walk when you press shift.

Big nope for me."
14567,"I tried this for the second time after a couple months, stil feels like a game that might have been cool in early 2000, gfx and gameplay feel really outdated. Maybe ill try it one more time when it comes out of early access."
14568,"the mechanics are kinda lacking. there is no leaning and you always run even though it feels like walking. it is 100% pay to win idc what the devs are saying. join a game and get 1 shot by people over and over meanwhile your starter weapon requires 5-7 rounds to kill someone, i could be wrong but i dont even think you start with a grenade but youll get killed by plenty unless i just didnt equip it but who knows because the menu system is way too busy and theres way too many options to deal with. when i launched the game i had a white screen the only fix was running in safety mode. anyway i gave it my like 30 minutes and im going to uninstal, it isnt a bad choice if youre looking for a game you dont have to pay for and a decent download size doesnt hurt so give it a shot if you want, but this needs a whole lot of balancing, pay to win removed and i might give it a second chance."
14569,best free to play game i hope it dosnt become pay to win game
14570,"a free game, and its epic. better than cod"
14571,"Very fun game, for fast-paced FPS lovers. Simple mechanics, and very easy to master. Completely free gameplay, only skins are paid, gotta love that on these days!"
14572,worst game ever
14573,first fps game i played :D
14574,"Probably best f2p shooter on steam rn 
10/10"
14575,"hi im john and this game is cool but it will be so much kool if it have  glove and the ak 47 pls chage it like csgo ak47 but all the guns is coll but put guns skin and guns skin box
thx man keep the good work"
14576,this game is super awesome and free to play and its awesome fps game to play with friends gives you the paying way for bullets ie currency for guns or just play for free and its game breaking with that aswell it very balanced in that way I really recommend this game if you want a free fps game which has a cool ranking up system but you got  to be fast :)
14577,"Played through the tutorial, first time launching was pretty glitchy, but got through it to play the tutorial.  Went to exit the game and it locked up Windows (10) and had to do a forced restart just to get the flashing screen to stop and game to close."
14578,"Trash game 100% !!! i enjoeyd it when it first came out but after all of this years this braindead devs only add new skinboxes !!! not fixing noreg , dying behind walls , crapy servers , 99% chinesse with 200+ ping cheating !!! Competetive - full of cheaters 90% of high tier ranks are walling and aimboting and not getting banned !!! If u want to report cheaters it's gonna be time waste cause they dont give a damn about it... so just don't waste ur time and nerves on it !!! Dont's even bother to download and give a try it's not worth it trust me ! Once a good upcoming game with lot of potential which was ruined by the golddigger devs in a few months..."
14579,Nice game
14580,This game is too easy.
14581,"It's awesome game
I play this game daily
Never boring
I have like 450+ hours of in game hours
Tbh its a f2p and no P2W 
"
14582,really good game
14583,"WORST HITBOXES IVE EVER SEEN IN A GAME TO DATE, THE MENU SCREEN IS MOST CLUTTERED PIECE OF SHIT, AND TO TOP IT OFF ITS HELLLA PAY TO WIN BECAUSE ITS FREE TO PLAY OBV"
14584,Most worst game i ever played
14585,"BEST EVER FREE FPS GAME EVER AND GOOD GRAPHICS : Side Note : if you don't know what i mean by fps : First Person Shooter , and frames per second aren't laggy at all"
14586,"i guki, i gunga'ed. gg."
14587,"I Create content for this game pretty regularly, and I appreciate their desire to try to not be blatantly P2W. Although I have a love hate relationship with this game overall I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a non Pay to win free to play shooter. Similar in style to CSGO, and hopefully with ranked solo/duo coming shortly!

If you are looking for a clusterf*** style mode look no further than airborne/destruction as it's a 32 man on a fairly big map. If you are looking for a TDM or demolition they have that as well."
14588,Really fun game
14589,"Played a few games, but don't see myself going back to it, unless I am really, really bored.

Look kinda cool and fun, but let's not lie to each other. It's a PAY-TO-WIN game and I don't like that system.

That is just the problem with 'FREE GAMES'. It does not matter how much time you put into mastering it to get on a higher level and of course get better weapons, when someone can come along and just pay a few bucks for a better rifle and clean your whole team. This is exactly what happened to Warface, a great, legendary game that had a lot of potential, but was butchered by the greedy game developers that wanted to make money off of it, but in a wrong way. 

In conclusion: it's a lot better to pay 5$ or 10$ for a game and not worry about anyone getting a better weapon because they payed more money than you, instead of installing a 'FREE TO PLAY' game that is based on a PAY-TO-WIN system. But, if you do want to make a game in which people are going to be spending real life money on, take a look at games like H1Z1 and CS:GO and copy what they are doing. Players can pay for skins that don't affect the gameplay AT ALL, instead of guns that are going to OP (over power) other players.

P. S. I personally did not like the way the game looks; it is a weird mix of Counter Strike, Combat Arms and I do not know what, but I did not like it. But, was kinda fun, to be honest. (:"
14590,"Nice GAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
"
14591,"Like 5 minutes into the game, the game crashed."
14592,"name change is like £6 and they removed the market :/
play csgo instead"
14593,Amazing game! You just need to play to get medal and buy guns! Skins are easy to get if you just play and get lucky to get 500 bs coin
14594,Good Game!
14595,[strike]nice[/strike]
14596,Luxus Game
14597,poor so i can only afford to play this amazing fps
14598,"It's solid for a free game. There's plenty of ways to unlock better guns by simply just playing, and you have nothing to lose other than your time for trying. There are plenty of better FPS's out there, but they're not free. It's a solid, fast-paced shooter with small maps where small attention spans can appease their appetite for killing people over and over again."
14599,"It is not pay to win as far as i can tell. So thats good. However, its a run and gun twitch shooter. Nothing more. Not a bad thing, but imo its pretty trash. Also, I have to go out of my way to get grenades, or I had them expire or something? Not sure what is the deal there. But, that was the first indication that pissed me off. I wouldn't bother downloading this one. (Also TDM, spawn camping galore and way too small of a map for 8v8 in my experience."
14600,What a fucking joke. Never in my life have a played a game where the shots dont register more then this shit game.
14601,"Big oof. game setting doesnt give choice of holding right mouse button for iron sights, even on the seting that doesnt say toggle its still toggled. the controls feel clunky and the sensitivity is super low even on max. However the game has potential but a co-op of some sort would be nice....."
14602,Pretty good tbh
14603,yse please
14604,v btgrf5fgyhjnjukiujkyhth6r4esawxqdrfgtghbntfvfdew3ds
14605,non-stop action for free...  better than my ex-girlfriend.
14606,What i  Actually like  is how the guns and the  actuall mechanics of the but what i dont like is like  the ' when  you shoot the enemy or when  even  the enemy shoots at you  you  are still tagged
14607,"Client ripp-off loot box system. Smells like pay 2 win.
It looks nice but seems not be be very far in development"
14608,Been trying to play this game but honestly its just not that fun. If you get put against people that are equal level to you it might be a fun game. Most of my games have been placed against lvl 30 to 40+ and sometimes even 50+ and they are just toxic as could be. Maybe if I had a game where it wasnt people that already have all premuim weapons and stuff I might get a fun game in but I havent so i wont recommend this game to anyone... ever...
14609,nice game
14610,TAC RELOAD
14611,"no exclusive full screen, no direct mouse input, no sprint, really buggy"
14612,Amazing game. Super fun. The game has an amazing multiplayer PVP game mode with tight and fun controls that compliment the amazing weapon verity and we'll made fun maps. There are some negatives to this game like a fairly low weapon amount and amount of maps compared to other games like CSGO and call of duty but even with these missing you are still getting a lot in a consistently updated free to play game. I would highly recommend this game.
14613,bad
14614,"EDIT:


        the game is literally dying now, I'm encountering hackers more then usual, it was a fun game with a fun gameplay, it's like call of duty + csgo, love it and still playing it 

"
14615,Good and very nice game i recommend :)
14616,"This game is pretty bad, with no way to heal the nade spam is just everywhere, the gunplay needs a total rework"
14617,"Where to start is the question for a Free Game, Black Squad is definitly one of the most underrated games ive ever played for along time! ITS SO GREAT, the maps have great features not boring after serveral times of playing alongside I hope to see more people have a go at this. JUST BECASUE ITS A FREE GAME DONT THINK ITS NOT WORTH DOWNLOADING...

Pros: Free"
14618,Hey it's fun.
14619,"Feels like any other call of duty clone. Graphics aren't great, lots of hackers, and overall just an average game. At least it is free."
14620,ghetto COD
14621,its acttually not that bad a lil cheesy but i like it
14622,good
14623,"1/10 trash game fucking pieace of shit .
"
14624,"This game is overall not bad. BUT it is fucking pay to win. It may not seem like it but it is. FIrst of all there are 4 different currencies. 1 is easy to earn but the others are premium which, you guessed it are what most of the guns cost to buy. Also, all the guns have similar stats but pick the wrong one and oops, there goes your hard earned cash. If you don't buy the right weapons then you will not succeed. In this game you either destroy the enemy team or get absolutely demolished which is the weak point of this game."
14625,Best fps shooter so far ... <3 guns and skins are awesome ... gameplay is smooth ..  a lot of setting options to have best pc performance .. seasonal skins are awesome .. but there are also a lot of things to improve .. better to have votekick/report system ingame .. and add new ways to convert medals earn into someting ... medals are getting useless once all items obtainable using it had purchased already.. overall ill give 8 over 10 ...
14626,gg
14627,Broken...
14628,"Where is report button ????????? 
Gj cheaters best players !!!"
14629,nice a game
14630,"Great shooter. Good variety of weapons and maps. Typical game modes, TDM, Search and Destroy, Capture, etc. It includes skins and boxes to open with real money."
14631,nice
14632,"feels good to play
"
14633,bad game
14634,"Fun games absolutely no pay to win 
Recommend to everyone who want to play hardcore"
14635,GREAT GAME NOT PAY TO WIN 10/10 RECOMEND
14636,Its free to play and the graphics are great. Best FPS atm
14637,Sexier version of Counter Strike
14638,Its a pretty good FPS game cosidering its free
14639,"Has basically no working Anti-Cheat in a F2P game, also TDM is just Nadespam."
14640,"if you thought cheating was bad in CS:GO....

BOY"
14641,"Good Game, not so good microtransactions"
14642,its a very good game
14643,Csgo basically. Fun
14644,"Very good and fun to play, awesome graphics and versatile enough to run on older machines too. The boxes and limited time items look like something out of a mobile game but it's definitely not a pay2win game. Many players, good maps, as far as I can tell it has a good anti-cheater control, I recommend it."
14645,"A bit buggy here and there, and servers are not the greatest but as a free online shooter i think its not bad. 
If fixed up where it needs to be and the devs add a few more options and feature i think it will be a great sucess.

The only issue i have is that the game at the moment resembles another free to play fps (Warface) a little to much, and that game has a lot more content and options on how to play including a multiplayer campaign in some way."
14646,"It is good, But the game is hard to play because of the models it is hard to spot and the servers is kinda slow and the problem here is that it is a pay to win game. But I do like the graphics and the maps, The maps were well made, Very Impressive in my opinion, I wish there will be more updates soon.

Overall : 8/10"
14647,its good i like it but there is  lot of problem
14648,GGGGGGG
14649,"Better than cs go i have 24 hours in this game every hour was worth it. Be advised this game is not easy and you will feel pretty down at first but you will pick up the pace eventually dont expect miracles in first 4 hours

14655,too clonkey to be enjoyable
14656,would be nice but its infested with cheaters and i couldn't even find the report button
14657,"Game where 1 team spawn camp other team, hitboxes are so off that sometimes you will kill someone who is behind the wall by just shooting near it, so better just skip it and play something else."
14658,I Love ths game ^.^ ♥
14659,"I would love to try this game, if it would just start.
I hope the developers are aware that a lot of people (trying) to play the game simply cannot do so.

Cannot recommend a game which won't start."
14660,jogo god
14661,"Awful fps game , no skill required just as well it is free"
14662,"Great shooting mechanics, dedicated servers, good player count. Such an underated F2P game."
14663,"I`ts a very good game, the desiners work so much better and made a fantastic game!"
14664,Great game
14665,"While I normally despise reviews by people who only play for a short time, I am writing one myself. To be fair, the game is simple and to the point. Where it fails so spectacularly is in its execution. Its extremely unpolished. The major reason I only played seven games was the settings. I played around for a moment and found 15'3 sensitivity was  the best for me. The issue that drove me away was when I spawned, the game was at its default sensitivity, and then suddenly go to the setting I had it at. This happened every time I died and respawned (which a ton, one person has such high ping he killed me after dying to a teammate)

Two other points of note.

Match making was quick, far quicker then I expected, but it would find a game, load, then not do anything for a minute, before spitting me into the match. Which was jarring.

Lack of recoil on the default weapons (especially the sniper) is laughable, unlocked weapons I picked up would 3 shot players but had such insane recoil I had a hard time using them.

"
14666,"TOO MANY HACKERS!!!

The game has no report function built into it, you have to created an account at the dev website and submit a report ticket! 
You get into games where someone will run around with a pistol, killing anyone with one shot without getting hit even once. They do a very poor job of keeping them out since there is no actual report function, their anti cheat is a joke and maybe once a month the game gets cleared of hackers for like a week and then they are back like nothing happened. 

Too bad, the game is actually fun when you don't get a wave hackers. But it's like one random week when they actually do something about it and then for the rest of the month it's hackers all around. At least it's free, so I didn't spend anything on it, and with the hackers always coming back, I don't see myself giving these devs a dime."
14667,Everything about this game pissed me off.
14668,csgo but not
14669,pretty gay
14670,Machine gun is op
14671,"Literally... My favorite FPS of all freaking time. I have over 985 hours on this game and am still having loads of fun! They keep smashing out new updates extremely often to keep the content fresh! And it's all COMPLETELY FREE. They have 0 pay-to-win aspects at all. They continue to satisfy the community by adding new features constantly. One of my favorite things about this game is that they listen to their community! If the community is upset about something, they actually will fix it! Overall with the fact that this is a completely free game... it is 10/10. Lets make a comparison... Imagine Combat Arms:Reloaded, except there is literally zero pay to win garbage, and the graphix are supreme."
14672,Free to play CSGO? xD
14673,"Great game , 
Unlike Warface ."
14674,garbage
14675,A worthy game to be dubbed as a good copy and a slightly different CS:GO.
14676,Well after some time game become a little bit bad because there is no new maps and not new weapons and nothing changed for kind of year and there is always updates to download but no changes in game and updates are kid of 1gb soo yeah . But game is verry good its free and you don't need a strong pc to run it . I recommend this game ;) !
14677,"This game had over 70% positive reviews, but I think it deserves 40% at the most. The movement and controls are great, but the shooting is severely flawed. Another silly shooter that relies on ping is all this game adds up to. Sadly even though the assault rifles work fine, the snipers require you to be completely still when you shoot, otherwise the bullet flies off at a crazy angle, nowhere near where you aimed. Maybe some people like this, but it was a dealbreaker for me. Just using MG's isn't reason enough to play this game. Hoping to see some changes come, as the game is still in early access.

5/10"
14678,Very nice game but new item making it's pay 2 win
14679,very nice game
14680,csgo kinda
14681,worst game ive ever played
14682,"Started playing this game as a replacement for CS(S/GO/xx) with my son. It's really simple to play, you have three profiles F1, F2, F3 that you can change while in a map so no need to buy in game, great graphics and I normally never wait more than approx 10 seconds to connect to servers in EU (TDM).

PROS
+ DLC's with lots of weapons to take them for at test-drive (15 days)👍
+ No Pay to Win!!!
+ Good maps
+ Team balancing seems good the most of the time
+ Great that you can get money and weapons just by logging in and playing the game daily
+ Love respawning until the 10min or 150 frag limit is reached
+ No hitbox difference no matter what character you choose!

CONS
- Seems like there is lot of cheating some times??
- Would be cool with an option to try all weapons in a bot map before buying
- Sometimes there are too many players on a single map"
14683,"Literally the worst matchmaking and connection issues i've ever seen in a game. Takes upwards of 200 seconds to get connected to a match (If you don't think that's too long, count it out in your head.) And you'll play through half of it before you rubberband, get disconnected, and then have the game crash to desktop every time.

The game is fun and mindless and enjoyable but right now i almost can't play it at all. Will TOTALLY write a positive review if/when this is fixed."
14684,"The game was promising. First logged in, won a few matches. Had fun honestly. Then, the worst happened. Hackers, and I don't like blaming my fails on hacks. It is immature to be honest, but this game, it is there. Everywhere there is a hacker in the game. I looked back at previous games and though about it. I turn the corner and one shot by an AR? Nah, doesn't make sense.

I played only half an hour. It is now deleted. I am sorry, but solving hackers is issue. Allow your players to report them. You cannot report anyone in this game. I might try later on, but at this point CS:GO, Ironsight, COD, Battlefield are a better choice."
14685,"For a free fps game, it's pretty damn good!"
14686,"amazing shooting mechanis, poor map design, no anticheat (yes there are many cheaters in the game)
dead community with no competetive scene except a few tournaments with ingame prizes for the past 6 month or so
the players are literlly terrible except a few teams who have any idea what they are doing, the rest quit a long time ago
because of no competetion"
14687,Good Game !
14688,The game mechanics and the maps are nice but i have two complains. The first one is the low variety of gamemodes. I like demolition and assassination because they are something new but i get bored over time. The second complain is that most weapons feel the same. For example almost all snipers do one shot and there is no reason to buy m107 which deals 100 damage because you can buy a normal sniper with credits and still do one shot while damage is like 94 or 96 thus feeling the same. The rifles and smgs fall to one of 2 categories: high rpm low dmg low recoil or low rpm high damage high recoil. Some of them have a grenade launcher but that doesnt matter that much. There are only 2 shotguns and i feel that they are way underpowered. Shotguns should deal more damage and one shot up to 1m. Even when i play with the higher damage shotgun i cant seem to one shot even at point blank. I have to say that i feel diffrent with each lmg but not by a lot. Pistols are ok i guess but i would suggest adding some more
14689,"Great free to play shooter with interesting gameplay, good optimization and decent graphics. Love it and can rate 10/10!"
14690,"They honestly just need to work on the anti cheat, and make the game more balanced with the gun damage to health. You drill someone with 7 shots with like a scar and they aren't dead (all in the body). And the beginning sniper you have to take like 4 shots to the body for someone to die, it should just be 2. Headshots are fine though, they should all be 1 shot 1 kill. But I had just gotten into 2 games and there was at least 1 hacker in both of them, one guy came around the corner and just drill me and my teammates every time. Thats my most frustrating part about the game, all the hackers and for some reason there is no way to report them. But overall it seems like a decent game and I hope the anti cheat and stuff gets worked on, thats what makes the game fun, not having hackers kill you every time you spawn."
14691,"TAC-RELOAD
Go play Ironsight instead (not on steam)"
14692,What i liked about this game is that you can play it for free and with your friends the only thing i dont like its that it copies other games like call of duty but i recommend this game
14693,Thats great! app. Im playing by few hours but i still want play.😎😉
14694,"So i just cleared my friend list and due to the increased amount of assholery all around i won't be accepting adds unless its for a trade (read the below mentioned rules 1st) or if i actually know you personally. I won't be adding anymore unknown people for the sake of it. However i am removing the restriction on my comment section so kindly post there first ""mentioning clearly the reason"" if you need my help with something or if it's regarding a trade , before sending me an add so i know why are you adding me.

14695,A very nice and fun game!!
14696,"Very Nice game, recommend playing, very fun. Its a nice change from fortnite :)"
14697,我们大大的需要游戏语音   没有语音的太无聊  希望把语音的加一个  玩的人会更多    你就会挣取大大的利益
14698,Awesome free to play fps
14699,"pretty cool
a little bit like csgo but a lot more better"
14700,Great Game!!!
14701,"For a free game that its takes skill and its not pay2win i really recommend it because you can easily learn whats going on here (easy to learn hard to master)

Gamemodes:

TDM:really fun to play espesially with music and your favorite gun to shoot

Demolition:best gamemode of the all for me because it just feels like you ae playing Counter-Strike

Assasination:I dont play this gamemode that much but its really good too

Battle Match:Really creative and fun to play too


Overall the game is free to play so try it for your self

Even Shroud played this game back in January and he liked it and he said that it just feels like Counter-Strike.."
14702,literally unplayable with 400dpi i tried 40 sens in game and still low as but overall the game is fun and enjoyable with friends
14703,"*open the new case*

*get the other new case*

*gotta pay real money to open that case*

10/10 would get ripped off again ~IGN"
14704,crossfire feels type of game
14705,Im actually going to reset windows because i want a fresh start from this game. Its like csgo had a retarded child that was molested by its uncle Call of Duty.
14706,very good game
14707,its free if you dont like it then you dont lose anything you can uninstall
14708,"One of the WORST game you can imagine for FPS. That game feells like pre-alpha game. NOT PLAYABLE. 

It feels like the devs have only wanted to develop crates and other free-to-pay options and left all the menu, HUD, settings, and the game itself as it was in their minds (= create any shooter game to gain profit fast). Garbage game + crates = profit. Strongly recommended not even try this game. It is a horrible experience.

-Huge time for matchmaking that will be finished with en error in 99%.
-No normal party option. Even if you search a game with your friends you may result in opposing teams after all.
-The only inhabited player mode is a TDM which is not for everyone.

It is a disaster game. Please, never ever try to do such game for any possible future. And delete this trash from the STEAM."
14709,veri gud gaem plei evryday
14710,"To Be Honest I Didn't Really Play It Much,I did Go Through The Tutorial And its Thought Out Slightly Well So I'd Give Them That....
Thats All I know...
Maybe Some Day It Will Appear More Interesting To Me When Its In Full Release.
Go try it out for yourselves if you want to, Not a Bad Game...Serious."
14711,lit game
14712,"The game is full of hackers and cheaters. Being able to shoot through the ENTIRE map with a shotgun and kill groups of enimies is just one example. There is also people with health hacks so they never lose health and many others using aim bots and one shot kill cheats. When the devs get off their tails and start perma banning the hackers and cheaters, then I'll recommend. Until then, just avoid this game."
14713,Love this game :)
14714,"The new Negative review

They change a lot on main game menu and mixed all servers together, now you will play global with people 900ms or 260ms and this made 4k daily players drop to only 900.
The other bad choice was cancel the market or trade items/skins/box you can buy/won inside the game when you are playing, now no reason to play 18 hours day .
THe competitive isn't good anymore, a lot of ""clowns"" inside your team being AFK or just trolling or to worst to be a competitive player.
Ping more tham 150ms isnt good for FPS game.

But the Dev team still very smart and close to comunity. Thanks again

I want go back with my review to positive and play more than 5 minutes day.

===========Old Positive Review==================
A very boring game but with a few toxic players. Yes is good have low because they polute the chat with tatical warnings, bad words, wrong calls but in competitive this players always got punished in rank so if you are a good player you will play for a little times with this trolls and go to the max rank fast when the players is very good educated.

I really don't like the game because of my ultrawide monitor in 2560x1080 get a very sharp for long range and no AA can solve, but I don't like the style of multiplayer games of anykind.

BUt you know, games is like drugs and I'm very good  f**** FPS player and I like punish myself.

50% of the game is a very good market itens, you can make money in competitive matches, so it's the half guilt I still playing. My wallet is full now again in this way I will can buy a lot of games in next steam sale.

You need a very good vga and 4 core cpu and play more than 120fps to get smooth experience and no teleporting guys. With an traditional monitors 60hz can play but need low response time.

SO it's a COOP game and only the best one players understand that is a team player game where your actions is to do the objetive and don't care about die in the process.

I think they will fix the issues because the DEV team is very active and a lot of week updates.

EDIT:

So for a small DEV team doing a very good work and put a lot of effort on this game I put positive and can recommend, so I don't like the game but can recommend and still playing.


THe only painfull thing is the very loud gun sounds, need an option to put this down please."
14715,"If you like games where you spawn at the edges of small square, walk few steps, kill one, than die, than repeat - you will love it"
14716,"Yeah, Its Pretty Good, A Little Bit On The P2P Side But, Its Good I Give It A 8/10 Good Game."
14717,this game is well made few bugs ive seen and looks appeasing to the eye. most off the maps are really good and nice to play on and ide love to recommend it. but i cant for one simple reason. THERE BALANCING IS BULLSHIT. all the ars are ridiculous while every smg and marksman rifle is weak ass the ssniupers one hit bodyshot no matter what the range. when i play a shooter i dont want fights to be 2 seconds were you walk round a corner get hit in the head once by a bullshit ar and sit out for the rest of the round. so devs please nerf pretty much all the ars ther broken stupid scrubby overpowered and ridicoulus as ar's should not be out damaging and out sniping a ddmr (marksman rifle) at range its bull.
14718,terrible game
14719,its alright
14720,"The game itself is a blast. Started playing in july 2018. Or rather trying to play. Connection with european servers (from mother Russia, Moscow) has good ping but still sucks enormous balls, resulting in an error every 10 minutes. Even if I was able to join a match, I won’t connect to the next, stuck in a map loading screen. 
Pls fix the servers so I can play."
14721,"From the bery first match, i knew what this game was. A breeding ground for campers and abusers, no chance to play the game properly. Dont waste your time"
14722,"lol cant even launch it. used to be able to work.

UPDATE: did the fix for it but come on we should have to do anything to be able to get it to work properly. other than that its a fun game. they definitely need to put like a cooldown or something on grenades though lol."
14723,"as my grandpapy used to say ""good enough lets get a beer""
"
14724,"i love shooting gams it is the first person shooter i have played

14725,Good game one on one

14727,Just download Ironsight
14728,"I don't know why but i can't play the Game:
Firstly, i open the game, there is a little tab and then
Secondly, i press start, but the Game just closes.

Please Help me

But the Game seems nice so i recommend the Game!"
14729,"Decent game play, guns are fairly easy to get, think a better CSGO."
14730,fuck dis shitty game full of 12 yr old chesse puff eating no life summer vacationed grandma cookie obssesed niggers
14731,I like this game because it's fun.
14732,"This is a great Run n' Gun game that you can invest a couple games in with some buds and chill.
It's not an AMAZING game, but it's a damn well made game and for it's price, I mean that's just amazing.

My only and biggest complaint is the UI!!!
The Menu is awful, it felt like I had just gotten 25 viruses browsing through the menu adjusting my loadout and trying to find a match. 
Other than this, I do recommend as a casual shooter and as a ""shooting the shit"" with your buds kind of game."
14733,"Very nice game and on low PC is runing perfect
"
14734,"ever since this update, the game has been crashing during playing. Pls fix this now T^T"
14735,"i did not got that i have spent over 500houre in bs with my 2 id

"
14736,Good as a Free to Play.
14737,no
14738,"great game all out great
"
14739,it fun play game since cheater step in i  play less this game then to my other games iam loosing intrest
14740,"I've been playing this game steadily for the past 2 weeks straight and I feel it safe to say this game is pretty great for what it is. It is not pay to win, you can unlock all guns by playing, and after 75 hrs of play time, mostly casually in deathmatch, I have all guns available on the market save 1 or two melee weapons.

I have read a lot about others having performance issues, but I have not had any of these personally it runs smooth and I get a constant framerate.

I also see a lot of talk about hackers in Black Squad as well on various online forums and here in the reviews, but have never come across someone hacking in my play time. I'm sure hackers exist as in any FPS  out there but it seems about the same rate I come across them in games like Arma, CS , etc.

My only real gripes with the game is as follows: 
[list]
[*]The matchmaking regularly messes up casual matches making it 4v5 or 2v3 randomly for no real reason
[*]The Grenades are temporary, they are only a thousand gold per day to keep  (which to be fair is almost nothing in this game's economy.) but it's still annoying to have to constantly re-equip grenades every couple days and manage them or join a game missing them  because you forgot.
[*]Grenade spam is real in deathmatch and can get a bit hectic on small enclosed maps.
[*]The UI Could use a bit of work it's not user friendly and  it looks like it was designed for a mobile phone.
[/list]

Overall I think it's definitely worth a your time, I was pleasently surprised and I think you will be too.
If you chose to try it download all the free test DLC guns on steam and I'm sure you'll find one you like and have a good time fragging some noobs."
14741,"Typical Korean F2P bullshit game.  Good luck finding ping below 80 and even if you do, you will die to a person with 350 ping since it has no anti cheat.  I feel ripped of even though it is a free game.  I thought CS:GO was bad with ping and hit bubbles until this fucking game."
14742,"Played for about 140 hrs. This game has a lot of issues and is dying rather quickly. I unistalled and don't recommend playing this game as its got way to many flaws.

Some Flaws:

1)As many have pointed out, team balance is horrible.  Im ok at best and would be leading my team wayyyyy to many times with others going 1-24, 4-22 while they back you up at base with nowhere to go but to die over and over. Sounds like fun right?

2) Game gets rather boring rather quickly, Fun facter quickly dies off.

3) Only a cpl good guns and 98% of them suck.

4) pistols and iron site ak47 constantly snipe across the maps A LOT ..completely broken.

5) major increase in hackers in last month or so, i hear they disabled the anticheat system.

6) No double tap run

7) I uninstalled with about 5 bucks left in the game, keep it, its not worth it

Positives:

1) Used to be fun, game isnt even out of beta and its already dying quickly, devs did a poor job on what could of been an decent game."
14743,"The worst multiplayer game, period.Full of hackers it will give you a headache, and take your money for worthless skins.At present I don't know who is cheating and who doesn't.And that tells a lot about how bad it is.Oh and add plenty of campers because the guns are bad, the hit registration worse, and the levels plain abysmal nightmare.To illustrate this, the only viable tactic to win a match, is to grenade spam & rush the enemy's spawn point...Despicable.

It is almost comical that the devs want this game to be an e-sports event.
Avoid at all costs."
14744,cool game wow
14745,What .... what.. what THE FUCK!
14746,Exactly what I've been looking for!! as an oldschool gamer (over 30) this game reminds me of what it used to be all about. SKILL team work and most importantly fun. The community is fantastic and the game is pretty bug free. Get into this if you've got fond memories of orignal counterstrikie and Urban Terror. This game takes everything to the next level.
14747,Very good game!
14748,ASS
14749,Fastest uninstall ever. Guess I know why its free.
14750,I played it a little.
14751,"Only 7/8 hours into this and it reminds me of some of the smaller Black Ops2 maps.

TDM is fast paced and easy to get pinned if opposition are good and you`re not. This can be frustrating if you`re not willing to put any effort in, as you have to work for your victories.

As freebies go, this is a great game and one that isn`t currently going the route of Pay2Win. Sure, there are things real money can buy, but they`re not exactly overpowered items that instantly win you the game*.


* Or the ladies :/"
14752,this game is very addictive and very fun however it only lacks the kill cam and the spectator mode on custom mode
14753,"It's like a game you would play, an online game..."
14754,"This might be a long review. It contains things I like, and things I don't like. First of all, it is in early access, the taking down of servers has been reduced by quite a bit, games que quite a lot faster then they used to, and you might wait for 2 minutes AT MOST. It is actually a very sense-challenging game (I can't really say much about this as I haven't played CS:GO), and sometimes insane clutches are needed to bring your team back from the losing side of things. Also, what I like is being able to by skins on the Market and ingame with ingame currency (Gold, BS coin and bullets [though bullets cost steam money]). Problems I have are that for some reason the teams I play against are sometimes f**king OP, like half my team are guys that have just installed the game about an hour ago and the enemy team are friggin crrazzzyy. Also, sometimes that team might even have more players then mine, but just a little problem. Sights are a little weird, one click to scope, one click to unscope, not the usual click to scope and unlick to unscope. Just another little problem, and scoping is kinda important as with some of the AK models the bullets end up hitting your feet once you have reached the end of your mag. Anyway, I suggest getting it, it is a free game anyway!"
14755,Nicee
14756,"I know you see that I dont have many hours on this game. I picked up this game when I was bored and just wanted to play a new fresh game. I read the reviews for this game and most are popular so I was eager to get in and play. The first thing I realized is that this game has a terrible, cluttered mainmenu. It was easier to walk and finish a labyrinth then it was to get around the menu. When I finally find where to go I look for my region, usally you can have east and west North America, but you can only chose North America which gave me about 200 ping. That is more ping than if you plug in a potato and a lemon  in place of your router and played another game. After all that I wait about 4-5 min waiting for a game, I could have made a hotpocket and comeback AND melted my mouth AND regret my decision before the game started. I FINALY get in a game, and as soon as I spawn a grenade lands by my feet trying to say ""hi"" but blew up before it could and I also blew up. Now I can get to the gameplay Here is a list of all the things I like and dislike

What I like:
It feels like the devs like this game and feel inspired in a sense

What i dont like:
Smaller maps than your lego battles you had when you were a child (so small you sneeze and your on the other side)
Gun play is just bare bones 
sights are pretty much useless
guns have no recoil
The game is free to play but not free to have fun
Need to buy with real money to have an upperhand
tries to copy games but fails such as CSGO and Black Ops 2 
The game's graphics are bland at best
Sound system is just broken
everytime I reloaded I got the same saying ""Tactical Reload"" or something like that
because the maps are soooo small Grenade spam is just everywhere 
long wait times
very confusing mainmenu
Guns have little to ZERO recoil making shooting very boring
No team cordination (Dont need it as everyone dies within 10 seconds as the maps are too small
Gun balance has been thrown farther out the window than Aaron Rodgers can dream of
Its hard to know when you are being shot sometimes as your person sometimes does not react in the slightest 
Match making is some of the worst I can think of other than playing in the NFL after learning what a football is

So yeah, i give this game a hotpocket that you left in the microwave for too long and shoved the whole thing in your mouth out of 10"
14757,"Ahhh black squad, a awesome arcade styled free to play game. Which is true, ladies and gentleman; ""FREE TO PLAY"". You dont pay a single coin to be equal as other players, i cannot explain how fun it is to bash japanese anime babes in head without feeling any advantages they have.. IT IS WONDERFULL, however this game has the most cancer community i have ever seen. People shouting bad words at each other, disrespectful comments etc. this is one of the downsides of this game, other could be only present for me through; long server search time. 

By the way this is an arcade shooting game which means that there is much stable spray pattern and severely fast player movement speed so beware of these if you care about them. 

Game's rewardment system is awesome and it keeps you playing this game for hours.
By the way if you needed an advice from me here you go; Never ever get gold random boxes, these mostly have useless shit in inside, also please dont CAMP :@

OVERALL I loved this game and i think i will play it for lots of hours from now on


9/10"
14758,"EDIT: The game died. It had so much potential. :( Don't even bother downloading it at this point.

This game is your typical FPS game. 
It's like COD and CS:GO had an offspring. 

Why bother playing this?
After years of playing, this is the only game that made me feel 
what I supposed to be feeling when playing games, having fun.

You won't bother when losing or winning. 
You won't really care if your enemies have higher ranks cuz you can crush them.
People don't say sht at you when you miss your shots. 
It's been years since I felt that. 

This is a nice game to relax and let it flow. 

I'm quite excited on adding the competitive mode.
I wonder how it would change the game.

99/10 +1 will quickscope bewbs of korean models. lol

Update for Autumn Sale!"
14759,"If this game was trying to be a chinese ripoff of Counter Strike and/or Call of Duty, it even managed to fail at that.  This game offers the same old boring mechanics that you've come to expect from this era of First Person Shooters, except in this game everything is poorly translated, there is no customer support, everything is overpriced, the community is toxic, hitboxes are innacurate, you are able to chose what server you want to connect to so people who have their own country's server seem to always flock to the North American server and bombard the text chat with their gibberish, and there is still no voice chat to this day.  When I first got this game I had high hopes that it would offer a different experience from all the other First Person Shooters I had tried, but what I got was a bootleg chinese Counter Strike/Call of Duty unwanted child."
14760,It's suprisingly solid for a free game.
14761,The worst game i have ever seen
14762,Severly dull. Feels and looks like a mobile / tablet game with keyboard and mouse control. Didn't even bother to finish the tutorial. Uninstalled. Cya.
14763,Cool Game! better than battle carnival!
14764,I'm really glad to play this game. It is free and you should play it
14765,"This game is terrible. IDK how they made a game that makes you feel so trapped, no freedom of movement.
Maps horrible. The ""only pure skill"" is non-existant coz you just spray and ppl die with loud SPLASH noises, no matter which gun you use..

And i am certain one in lobby sountrack was taken from ""Warzone 2100""

But i guess its free...
"
14766,"Not much to say fun game, even though i dont play that much"
14767,"Why Thumbs down? 
Well its actually a thumbs up i just reskinned it as a thumbs down. To get thumbs up you just need to buy a key using money and roll for a box then hopefully u get a ""thumbs up"" skin when you open the box to unlock my ""thumbs up""

https://steamcommunity.com/games/550650/announcements/detail/1691547818958702464"
14768,THis game at first is good not P2W but after few month the game start to introduce new gun but not in shop but have to use real money to buy key and unlock the gun and best thing it is RNG only can get. ANd now they said it is just a skin when they are 2 different weapon and name
14769,best game :D
14770,"Best free to play FPS on Steam currently with a high skill ceiling. Competitive and casual modes, varying games modes, large weapon selection. Optimized & running smooth, has good hit detection, and frequently updated by developers that care. It is NOT pay to win.

With that said, this game is not overdone in the slightest, it is all it needs to be. A simplistic, barebones shooter reminiscing of classic CS and CoD4. Only gripe I have is that some of the maps need to be refined a bit, but that is just a small ask. 

Support this game!"

Quite good!"
14782,"Despite having no campaign, I really enjoy this game. Theres new maps every so often, whether its small to big maps its a big price to pay. I highly recommend this if your a Call of Duty Fan! :D"
14783,Best Game!!! GG
14784,"Garbage Game. If you want an FPS and dont want to pay, I guess, but good luck battling both the people in this game and its constant attempts to ruin your saved configurations. Mouse Sensitivity? One size fits all apparently. Want to change volume settings in the middle of the game? Go F**k yourself. Want a gaming experience that makes you wonder if Auschwitz might have had better service than this game? Look no further.

0/10. Would ask the developers to go back to designing different kinds of water bongs in their cousins basement."
14785,"Terrible game in all aspects, I normally love most games I come across but this is sad. The hud is poorly implemented, the game is extremely buggy and the shooting mechanics are horrific. Its such a terribly made game and I don't understand people's liking towards it."
14786,"Play to win type of game? not really. But like the mechanic. Far more different then any FPS game. More arcadieer then ""real-life"" FPS."

this a great game and highly recomended if you like playing cll of duty but dont have the money to buy it and in my oppinion this game is even bettter thn COD"

14794,"Terrible map design; way too many openings in demolition for 2 people to hold. The sites shouldn't be so small, and have 4 different entry points. Whipping out grenade launchers and rushing towards the same 3 tiny corridors, with only one single point of coverage might I add, is so lackluster, and renders more tactical gameplay useless in more competitive gamemodes, such as Demolition 5v5. Grenade spam is this game's biggest falling point. Since the maps are so fucking small, there is constant grenade spam. I don't see how anybody genuinely find this enjoyable. Sniping and other gunplay scenarios are actually decent, though. I wouldn't even touch this game until the maps are enlarged."

Reminds me of the classic Combat Arms, Without the hackers. No pay to win here, and customs can be earned without a single dime."

14800,"i DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME.


I've played a couple of games and this is what i have to say about this game and the things i think really need to change.

first of all the maps are completly ripped off of other popular Shooters.
The guns are totally unbalanced you have sniper rifles that need 2 headshots to kill someone.
Most Assault-rifles feel the same without attachments.
The recoil is pretty shitty most of the times you're better off hip firingthen ADS.

Sprinting isn't an option you need to hold your knife to run faster ( could solve with binding your knife hotkey to shift ) 
i know this is also the case in csgo but csgo is a more slow tactical based game were you pretty much only run with your knife in the beginning of the round.
But when you use it and wanna go back to your primary weapon ( scrolling up twice in most games ) you're stuck in a cycle between knife and secundary. if you wanna go back to your primary you gotta press the ''2"" button.

The way to get new weapons sucks alot the prices are way to high in comparison to the currency you earn by playing games. ( i got new weapons because i was lucky and got alot of money in my crates ).

also the menu feels way to complicated.

But for the rest the game feels smooth.

No lagspikes
Good servers
The sound when you kill people and get headshots is really satisfying.

Note : This is my opinion if you would like to share your opinion please add me on steam or comment in this review"
14801,OK OK OK
14802,nice game
14803,"Interesting Game with Cool Mods
My FAVs Are destruction , Demolation , Melle
- Many New Items and Skins added To this Game recently And thats a Good Point with Existance Steam Cum Market"
14804,Incredibly bugy and feels rough to play. Everytime i alt tabbed and tried to come back into the game my screen would flash black until i restarted my pc. 0/5 Don't bother downloading it
14805,GG!
14806,"Valofe f#cked this game right in the ass tbh
-Half-assed effort on the new updates
-Cheaters are still present
-Servers are a joke
-Plus all that medal and bs coin rotation ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
if you are a new player don't bother playing this game all the old player base are leaving the game slowly and it will be dead soon"
14807,"the game is pretty shit
because it doesnt have any Australian servers"
14808,.
14809,"Battleye support, dedicated servers, great shooting mechanics and amazing netcode. Black Squad is a military first-person-shooter game using the Unreal Engine 3 to show realistic graphics and dynamic visuals. [b] Absolutely no Pay-to-Win. [/b] Welcome to the best F2P shooter on the market.

Didn't even took them a year to break this promise.
I loved this game and play it since the closed beta but now they already released the second gun which is only obtainable via real money from random boxes. Update after update they only release skins without any real content in addition and I was okay with it but that is just too much now. Queue times were already quite long but with this pay 2 win aspect don't even bother with this game."
14810,"DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. 
 pros 
- decent gun balance 
- good reward for skill based shots with certain weapons 
- fun game when players arent being massive toxic cucks or everyone and their damn uncle is piling in front of your shot so you cant see and get colated by some low skill fuckboi. 
- not Pay to Win really
Cons 
- allows anyone under 300 ping into the lobby which means 100 ping - 280 ping asshats joining the teams. 
- half the community is toxic fuckbois who thint they are a god for using 1 tap guns 
- connection is random and you get 30 ping up to 1000 ping from NA servers while living in NA
- wallhackers are in half the games I play ( blatant prefiring ) 
- 9/10 of the time your team is only good enough for cannon fodder because they seem to not know how to play the damn game or how to aim. 
- everyone in this game is a fucking braindead inbred fuckup of a human being that has no awareness of their surroundings or their teammates ie. every time I try and snipe some cunt on my team is blocking my shot and when I dont have the special ed's rejects blocking my view I have some 200 ping cucklord kill me with a peakshot I can not even see a frame of until im fucking laying in a pool of my own blood with a goddamn makeshift fleshlight in my head. 
- its fucking nade city on half the damn maps. They ( as far as im aware ) don't have a option for gamemodes or lobbies with no nades which mean no escape from hell for me yet again ahahahaha. OH AND maps are shittily designed for nades anyways. One side always has an advantage which means they can throw ease bank shots or easy toss shots towards your spawn or the hallway/alley/lane coming from spawn so you push out only to have 50 fucking nades being thrown at your face like a fucking physical reenactment of a sexy ass bitch on tinder ( the nades being dicks yunno ). 
- Hitboxes are fucked. I can clip the aura of this poor motherfucker who thinks he's solidly behind cover and I see his shadow there and blazer( sniper in the game) shot his soon to be sad boi looking motherfucker ass into tomorrow. 
- This game is broken as fuck for hitboxes , I can pour hot lead into some fuckers skull like a black guy in prison can pour cum into some bitch bois skull and none of them will hit. You gotta hit basically the eye brows and up to  count as a head shot. IF you're lucky that is. 
- Your teammates can block you into a corner so you cannot jump away from a nade or do anything. Unless your teammates manage to have an IQ over 70 then you're well and truly fucked like any mildly attractive asian at a suburban orgy 

Now that I think about it , the only pro in this game is the fact that its not PTW. Although it is trying to milk ya for those skins. Trying to be a CS:GO a little bit."

14816,this games is god
14817,"It´s like the ""special"" cousin of CS:GO and Call of Duty. The gunplay is ok but the graphics are very outdated. There is also an ingame shop for various skins etc. (I know the devs need to make money out of this game since it is free to play)
If you are a fan of the above mentioned games you can give it a try but it´s not my cup of tea."
14818,"best game so far !

"
14819,"I think its ok,not too good but its good to waste time.


The optimization wise is pretty good in my opinion,you can run this at a solid 50 fps on a dual core"
14820,need open mic chatting for easier communication.

14823,"Reviews from people under ~120 hours of playtime cannot be taken seriously. 

The gameplay is fun, smooth and super enjoyable. 
You have both intense fights, tension moments and heroic victories. There's lots of teamplay and it is indeed an awesome fps, very much comparable to CS:GO. And no, it's not a p2w.


Pros:
- Smooth gameplay and will run and many computers.
- Not a p2w
- Lots of different gamemodes.
- Has a skillcap, so the more you play the more you own.
- Sounds. You'll love the headshot sound.

Neutral or things to rework

- Maps. There are not many very good maps for demolition (the competitive game mode). Many maps are too good  either for defending or attacking.

- Snipers. Too op in my opinion. They need some rework, at least the most powerful ones. They one-shot very easily. Although this point is very subjective.

- GLs. Many AR have an attached grenade launcher. While the concept is good and is an interesting tactic aspect, they deal way too much damage. They should be used to finish-off very low hyealth enemies and to find out wether enemies are hiding in some spots or not. Currently they are too OP.

- Flashbangs. Although they reworked them recentyl and they did a good job, they didn't make an awesome job. CS:GO has awesome flashbangs, Blacksquad doesn't.

Practice mode. Although good, I miss a feature to practice against moving targets. I should be able to record a movement for a bot before spawning it and then practice shooting at it. Bot TDM is simply not good if you want to get better at demolition games.

Cons.

- No deathcam. This is a MUST for this game

- User Interface. The UI sucks in this game. The menus are horrible and are anything but intuitive. However, the UI while ingame is pretty much acceptable.

- Tutorial. It is awful.

And now my 2 cents about the cheating problem.

I have recently seen a trend among new players of acusing everybody of cheating simply because they are not experienced enough with the game. Here are the reasons of why you suck at this game:

- Radar awareness. When enemies are literally making noises around you, they will be displayed in the minimap. If you don't move your stupid eyes away from the crosshair and check the minimap when your teammates die, you die. What happens next? You complain and cry like a little baby.

- Map awareness. Knowing the map is one of the most vital things in this game if not the most. You should know where enemies are most likely to be hiding and what angles to hold. This also applies to when you're alone against two or more enemies. Use your dumb head.

- Sound awareness. I can't stress this enough. Jumping=noise. Running (default) = noise. Reloading weapon=noise. Picking a new weapon from the ground=noise. Falling=noise. And most importantly: SHOOTING=NOISE. 
I still don't understand why players that shoot literally next to me complain when they use a silencer and then I kill them. Dude, your gun makes fancy noises. The funny pew pew was not implemented for your ears' pleasure.
Paying attention to sounds and where they are coming from is crucial.

- Preaim, aim, prefire and recoil: This is pretty much self-explanatory but since people that don't control recoil acuse others' of aimbotting, I guess I'll have to shed some light on this dark obscure and mysterious topic...

DON'T USE A GUN IF YOU CAN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THINGS LIKE RECOIL EXIST YOU DUMB *SS.
Preaim is heavily tied with map awareness. Knowing the map is key to where you can expect enemies. Knowing where a head can pop up and at what height is also key for securing a headshot on the first bullet while preaiming. 
As far as aim is concerned, unless you're Almighty Shroud, there's not much you can do aside from practising. When you face 2-3 enemies at once, killing them all depends on how good is your aim. There's no prefiring bullshit here, just skill.
Prefiring is another issue...There are a few spots in many maps in which prefiring makes sense. Actually not doing it is arguably stupid. But usually prefiring is indeed a sign of cheating. Only came across a cheater that prefired once during my 514.2hrs of gameplay. Any other time was either sensitive or random noob with smg that went like 1/0/10 in KDA.
Finally there's recoil... All weapons have their recoil. Either you know or you don't. Can't recall how many times I had a teammate literally shooting the sky because he didn't know what recoil was and then blaming the other player of cheating. Shameful

Finally, my last words about cheating are that at least in the European servers, cheaters isn't that much of an issue as others say. Not because the game has insane anticheat measures, it doesn't. Mainly because players that'd make money with this game have bots farming in non-competitve game modes such as destruction or tdm. Lots of bots knifing a wall or jumping for the whole game. 
There might be a few cheaters here and there playing competitive just to reach viper 1, but cannot tell. I've only come across cheaters twice in this game and with one I have my doubts."
14824,Great FPS game
14825,"I LOVE THIS GAME. L-O-V-E, the graphics are great. I love that you can play different modes, and stuff. There was no issues with my game. I would definitively recommend it!"
14826,Good game
14827,Very nice FPS game
14828,very shit do not download blyuat
14829,its a free shooter no bad if you got a good connection and friends to play its free so download and try for yourself its not pay to win so just skill u no how all games should be ............ (cough) (cough ) ......... nope just had to cough :P
14830,"Movement and gun play feel poor, grenades barely do any damage, tutorial level is broken, animations are below par, sounds are terrible, translation to English is not great. Feels very rough at the moment. Seems like it has potential - just don't bother with it yet until it's been developed more."
14831,Awsome game!!! Would have loved more purchable skins. To get skins is a gamble. Not a fan but gameplay is cool.

14836,This game is the most unbalanced trash I have ever played in my life. Hard pass. Do not recommend.
14837,Game rat ok. Toi rat thich game nay
14838,"Love this game!. Have been playing quite some time now!.  I have 171 Hours played so far and over 10,000+ kills.  I usually only play Sniper mode it is by far my favorite!. The maps do get a little repetitive it would be nice to have new maps every now and again, or at least have a ""workshop"" for users so members of the community can create and design their own custom maps. That I think would be a great idea!. I give this game a 9/10"

14840,"for a free game, not bad at all. My internet speeds suck ass, and it plays rather smooth for me. controls are easy, not bad at all"
14841,"Dead game since spring 2019! i playing this game about 3 years, in the front was good but with bad updates and did not fixing bugs now this game is dead!
Full of AIM hack and Wall Hackers! full of lag switchers. also developers did not fixed basic bugs like No Register bullets (Your shot damage enemy and you see blood splash but your bullet will not register and enemy's shot will kill you); or not start game bug; or wrong server start game with high ping.

If developers WANT fix bugs and block cheaters can survive the game but they did not want and abandoned game to himself!

Update 2021 Sep

Still ridiculous game in 2021. full of cheater, no register bug still happen after 3 years. racist support (can prove with screenshots).
Dead game and Shit game!!!"
14842,its a great game but takes a bit of time to get a new weapon but still you will have fun doing so to get the guns you want and you may get guns or weapons that when sold give a good chunk of change for the weapon.
14843,nice game but lack of players!
14844,Hacker simulator 2018!
14845,As Free as it can be . Enjoy <3.
14846,"I started playing this game as a joke mainly, just something to f u c k around in where I don't have to deal with the stress that competitive modes in games such as CS:GO deliver. Well, as it turns out, I play this game way more often than I would have ever imagined. It's pretty solid all around, especially due to it's simplicity. It is in no way pay to win either, which makes it all the better. Every gun in the game can be acquired permanently without having to pay a dime, just by playing the game. This game is practically a mix of CoD and CS:GO. While it doesn't offer anything new to the table, it does its job well enough to warrant players to keep coming back for it's simple mechanics and fun combat. Pick this up if you're bored and want to kill some time, it's free after-all."

14850,if you like shit hit scan and nades this is the game for you
14851,Black Squad is fun and all but matchmaking is still somewhat terrible and the game is plagued ridden with hackers ( for some reason people want to hack at FPS games ) but overall its a good game that you should play .
14852,Plays like a Shockwave shooter from 2010. Has a lot of settings so you can tweak it to your playstyle. Has many modes. Playing with 120 ping from Australia is pretty good so far. I won't play further but I recommend it to people who want some COD nostalgia or have bad PCs.
14853,"I'll give this game a 8/10
the graphics gameplay balance anticheat everything is pretty good
but it loses points when it comes to map...maps are not even half decent
the devs should really work on the maps
overall very good experience
i shall gladly choose it over cs:go if the maps were better because cs:go's set recoil pattern and using the crosshair for reference only didn't sit well with me[{strictly in my personal opinion--but i think cs go is overhyped}]
well..good luck black squad in its future endevours."

14860,I think it is a good game but I don't like the limited guns

The great advantage of this game is the road of advancement"
14862,"This is not anywhere near the cs go competitions and paid tournaments... BUT, the game does not want to be cs go, this is a newer version of old fun games and the fact that is has no P2W elements into it, man this game is cool. You can buy everything you want for medals or credits in game which you get for a log in reward everyday and after leveling up. Usually im a very competitive player in cs go, i left the game becouse i didnt felt attracted by it anymore after i was global for a year or so and i got angry and frustrated on my teammates and yet i am not dissapointed by finding this game which i can play with my lower level skill friends and still have fun and not rage at all. I do recommend this since its fast paced and if you want it you can do some really nice teamplay with your friends or just playing solo is rewarding as long as you dont write with caps in chat when you died first time in a round and blame the team or call the player that killed you a ""hacker""."

14871,VEri Gud
14872,"I wouldn't say i completely ""not recommend"" the game, But here are the issues i found, or where the game lacks

My Main problem
The Grandes & Grenade Launchers are too much, the quantity of explosions is ridiculous & the fact that they are lethal is even more ridiculous. ( instant kill if you are close). I mean the game have recoil patterns & familiar hit-damage to Counter strike which means the game highly rewards skill. but the Nades are kinda bound to luck when they are super lethal.


Animations & Visuals
Some times when you hit an enemy head/chest, it gets pushed back not allowing you to connect more shots ( basicaly it works as if he's dodging bullets).
Movements & specially Shooting animation arent smooth & look clunky

Competitive gaming
it doesnt have voice chat, & on top of that you cannot chat with teammates while dead.
at the moment it doesnt have ranked match making.

Some items you purchase are temporary, kind of stupid ( Grenades huh) & a smarter move would be the purchase of weapon gadgets (permanant) that arent customizable while they should be.

i like the game & it has more great potential, but since my main problem (written above ) is probably a core aspect to this game & will not be changed, i wouldnt recommand the game, how ever i might still play it just because it feels like counter strike & the glorious sound when u get a kill ree"

14876, A very amazing game.. GG! Valve
14877,"strongley one of backers of this one,found it very interesting and fresh game
as long as it stays free take the advantage of it and play it hard.....D:"
14878,good job ns studio this game is awesome
14879,"There should be in game talking like cs:go has it there should be that update ........
Over all the game is best and would recommend always"
14880,2 gud
14881,ma cac pe el de joc.
14882,great game considering its for free .
14883,"OOOOO
(-:-)"
14884,R6S + CS:GO + Some other games mixed in a shity free game !
14885,Fun
14886,bom game pow powpow
14887,"ALL I WANT IS OCEANA SERVERS.................................. fells bad man :(      still a great game though, higly reccomended"
14888,this game is really fun but it randomly stopped letting me play i try to go in and it just gives me a white screen while the game audio still plays.
14889,gg
14890,"Was great fun at first then BattlEye failed and won't allow play! It claims a legal program is not and refuses to allow me to play.
Black Squad can do nothing but appologize ??? 
Why does Steam allow companies with bad policy and uncaring agents to muck about with people and not be require to fix their errors. 
From Now on if it says BattlEye its a no go they are irresponsible and cannot be bothered to fix their problems!"
14891,The game loads up but when i hit play it closes it's self
14892,"good game
"
14893,nice game i like it
14894,just good
14895,"ok, i know i only got 3 hours on this review but this game is pretty much like all the games that mix principals from cs:go and cod and tries to get the best of both.
this 1 specificly succeed higher than many other games hence gaining popularity
personally to me: gun mechanics altough the guns are unbalanced you can get some awesome guns at the very start very easally especially at sales
1 problem: grenades, especially explosive ones are over powered and are rental of 1750 game currency per day, no way of permenant aquiring unless you plan to invest lots of time in the game"
14896,"The Best Part, It is free to play, secondly, it is much better than Rainbow Six Seig who are money hungry and CS Go; full of Hackers..."
14897,Best! I love it.
14898,garbage
14899,this IS coola
14900,"Its really just not bad. Its like a new version of counter strike except not as good but looks a little nicer/newer. I mean its free so just try it out, there is no harm. Only con is that there are some real hardos on here that must think that they can go pro on this game. It is as fun as a first person shooter can be."
14901,nice game
14902,why crash in match room after the game
14903,Good
14904,This Game is so fucking good its unbelievable how much fun this shit is. only bad thing is that it doesn't have volume because you go deaf if you launch the game. if i had a pc that could run the game i would play it al lot. jk this game is so bad lmao. o/
14905,"Overall is a good shooter. The gunplay feels nice and the game is fast paced.

Some downsides is the grind for new weapons and spawning."
14906,Good game
14907,pretyy good game but grapihics look ew.Some smrt devs truned setting to medim as default.Almsot uninstalled then I cchecked video setting lol totally different game on high settings
14908,"I start Black Squad.
[INFO] Blocked loading of file: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\LastPass\nplastpass64.dll"".
LastPass - Very popular password manager. I use it as an extension of Chrome. Turn off - the same error. Delete the .dll.
I start Black Squad again.

What Intel utilities interfere?
I start Black Squad again.
Can not begin communication 293
A few more attempts to launch - Can not begin communication 293
20 minutes later - Can not begin communication 293
Another 2 hours later - Can not begin communication 293
Another 3 hours later - Can not begin communication 293

Idiotic game, writes errors due to proven software products, but it does not work."
14909,"Great game for me..specially the rewarding system.and tthe 5 dollers I got from the free game.. :v thank u bs

"
14910,"I have played this game over 100 hrs. (ignore the 132hrs its because my game was open while i was inactive at times)

Lets explain this first

Black Squad is fun game built on Unreal Engine 3 ,  Graphics are decent
but it can lag sometimes , The game has several modes - C4 diffusing (CSGO) , Deathmatch and similar ones

Its like a csgo rip off but its good

OVER 100 HRS OF GAMEPLAY I HAVE ONLY MANAGED TO GET 4 SKINS.

its hard to gain items , honestly its fun to  play when you are a low level player because once you get higher it feels like you're players who have aimbot on

still recommended ,"
14911,It's a good game
14912,"[h1] Overview: [/h1]
Great FPS game with most guns accessible for F2P players. Daily rewards are they way to get credits, no need to in game grind for hours to get a certain gun. The FREE DLC's are recommended are they let you try out a lot of the guns for FREE for a duration of 2 WEEKS! Matches usually last 10-20 minutes for me. If you want skins, you have to pay, otherwise the game is completely free. Here are some of my gun recommendations for new players:


[h1] Shotguns: [/h1]
KSG - Nevered played shotgun (never fit my style) so IDK. People say this is the best shotgun though.


[h1] Assault Rifles: [/h1]

[b] Lasers: Recoil is basically non-existent [/b]
ACR GL - Best laser hands-down. 

[b] Balanced: Slight recoil is there, 4-hit kills for body, 2-hit kills for head [/b]
M4 Custom GL - My favourite gun hands-down.
MDR GL - Basically the M4 with a barely noticable difference. You pick between the two.

[b] OHK Headshots: 3-hit body kills, 1-hit headshot kills, HIGH recoil, LOW RoF [/b]
AK12 GL / AK47 GL - Only difference between the two is the AK12 has a laser and sights, while AK47 has iron sights.
SR-47 GL - Less recoil than the AK's but more spread.

[b] Hybrid: 3-hit body kills, 2-hit headshot kills, medium recoil, LOW RoF [/b]
S15 GL - Only gun in this catergory (I think)


[h1] Sniper Rifles: [/h1]
Any bolt-action sniper rifle and the Dragunov is a good sniper rilfe


[h1] SMG: [/h1]
Vector - IDK, rarely see people play with SMG, heard this gun was good.

[h1] LMG: (Only used in Destruction game mode) [/h1]
Pecheneg-B - Only LMG I see and use in the game. Other LMG is basically never used.


[h1] Designated Marksman Rifles [/h1]
SCAR-H - This catergory of guns is rarely used, SCAR-H my favourite of the two DMR's


[h1] Pistols: [/h1]
Desert Eagle - OHK for headshots
M45 CQBP - A lot of people's favourites
Skorpion / MP5K - Fully-auto secondary, basically a SMG.


[h1] Melee: [/h1]
Really doesn't matter"
14913,Great Free to Play Game!
14914,i love this game CS:GO + COD = Black squad
14915,The most favorite game to me
14916,i like the frame rate just like CS:GO :3
14917,"A great free to play fps game. Love this game. If you want to play fps with your friends and don't want to pay, this one is for you. NOT A PAY TO WIN GAME. Your skill matters. Though there are some hackers but not as much as other free to play games."
14918,Nice Game
14919,"One of the better FPS games I've played.  While it is a ""Cash Shop"" heavy game to have some of the better gear, it's still quite fun."
14920,be good if you could a joypad and not mouse and keyboard.
14921,Very good game.
14922,"I've been playing this game for quite a while and enjoyed most of the hours. Many guns to choose from, not customizable. A mildly toxic/friendly community in game, could get very chatty in the chat.  Play tdm and get bombarded with nades left and right! Getting shot around the corners is cool. Non-registering shots is better. A hacker here and there is awesome. The sweaty pigs in a pick up game is fantastic. 
Assassination is a fun mode; however, filled with scrubs and laggers who dont understand that you can learn how to play by pressing F11.
Thats all I got"
14923,"Nice game. I liked the concept of few game playing like Kill/defend the VIP and small maps makes it fun! 
But hate one thing that to buy a new weapons you really need to earn points/gold!"
14924,gud.
14925,"This game is easy to comprehend, nothing much to configure or any, just sit down and the rock  n roll..
the feeling is like the same old game cs/quake."
14926,playable but low playerbase.
14927,这简直就是CF的欧美版，各种吊炸武器，见过手枪攻击距离跟诅一样的吗
14928,Dead gaem
14929,very very bad game
14930,เล่นไม่ดีเลย
14931,"shit game no sound the graphics are good but so many errors sound problems and ping problems
"
14932,Worth
14933,"This game has a lot of potential to compete with other FPS games like CSGO,Call of Duty. Just need to follow the given steps:-
1. Add Voice Chat
2. Add Competitive Mode for all players
3. Need to organize tournaments in a more sophisticated way
4. Add report player system
5. Need to do updates on regular time intervals.
Overall Game is Fantastic!! The most important thing, its FREE!!!!"
14934,lmao garbage
14935,Decent FPS game
14936,one of the best military games that i have ever played better than footnut thats rith?
14937,"32 bits vale¿?

"
14938,I can see why its free to play
14939,good game
14940,Best game ever
14941,"i honestly thought this might turn into a good game if the devs kept updating it its lik4 they gave up on it


edit: devs be like ""durrrr let's add stupid skins instead of actually putting on good content and updates lololololol we are swimming in money."
14942,"old but gold
"
14943,good game
14944,Snipers are useless in this game fucking whole game is trash
14945,"I hope they dont fuck this up.
"
14946,Free and fun nuff said
14947,"Of the 50 or so times I tried to launch this game I would say 47 of those times it got stuck at a white screen after I press play. The game might be decent but this problem alone ruined the experience for me,would not recommend unless you have 100 patience. Uninstalling."
14948,I love this.
14949,good
14950,<3 <3 <3
14951,issa good game
14952,its like counter strike for those who cant afford it 9/10 .... be patient with this game if you want to get gud
14953,"Great Game 99%... except...
1. TDM maps are wayyy to small
2. Grenades are wayyy to OP
3. sniper scope sens needs to be seperate to holosight sens
5. needs to be an oceania region"
14954,굿쏘는맛으로함
14955,just ... nah....
14956,"Five facts about this game
+: not yet
-:
1. Cheaters
2. No updating BE anti-cheat
3. More bugs
4. Unreal Engine not game-engine for FPS shooter!!1
5. Disbalance
6. P2W like in all asian games <3"
14957,"I'd love to tell you how the gameplay and visuals are. However, I have yet been able to load the game. Just goes to white screen. 10/10 game devs."
14958,"Personally dislike it, not really a new concept in the market... But still very good for a free to play cod-csgo mix game."
14959,its better then fucking cs:go great fps for 0 money............ and now im goin to hang my self =)
14960,This game's got really good graphics. I would compare it to Counter-Strike but it's more of a Team Deathmatch type of game. Very fun and will be playing this one regularly.
14961,CSGO on crack. Great Game
14962,"Nice Tactic game ❤
Nice map's 
And Nice Graphic"
14963,Pretty good game especially since it is free!
14964,"Good f2p shooter, give it a go!"
14965,Need ranked match...
14966,"Awesome game. But the community ruins it. People don't understand it's a team based game...
People leave in the first round and nothing happens to them. There should be a cooldwon or something.
"
14967,I played this game for almost an hour and comparing it to the worst fps games I've ever played it still fell below expectations. Your player is a bullet sponge who takes sniper shots to the head and doesn't flinch. All the primary weapons feel the same and testing showed that they all do basicly the same damage per mag with the only difference being how fast they do the damage. There is no recoil in this game making it feel like a game of paintball instead of a warzone. This is just a few of the things I found in the few minutes I played this game.
14968,"At first, This game feel like a low budget game in almost every aspects. Aesthetic of this game mostly aim to teen audience with ""Kool"" looks which is not worked for me. Cheap tricks like flashy filters , over the top pop-ups and forced rock music in the menu are everywhere. This game should be a bad experience for me... but it's not.

One Thing that really made me give a positive review for this game is how simple and straight forward gunplay this game has.
It is skill based, Has a good depth behind it and easy to understand. One unique feelings of this system is it didn't care about how you handle your gun as long as you can kill someone. You can play this game like CSGO (never zoom in , using burst control). You can play this game like CoD (Snapshot and ADS). You can Even play like R6S (Walking shoot , ADS). It doesn't forced you to play in specific way. It still has optimal style to play it best but giving players options without worry too much on penalized specific style is generally a good thing.

This game also has a good amount of players (at the time of review). Being F2P is Helping a lot on drawing people in. Gears are locked behind in-game and premium currency. But it does seem to me that they hand over the in-game credits generously (for now). Also the game did have first timer discount for premium currency purchase so you don't have to worry too much on giving this game a dime to testing how much worthy premium currency can buy in this game."
14969,"THE GOOD

- Movement is solid. No quirky steps or clipping through shit.
- Lots of guns, but is still limited in a sense (see THE BAD section)
- Not pay to win at all. You can buy items with real money, but they're mostly cosmetic and don't give any advantage.
- Very easy to learn and get into and have fun!
- I've never had issues with lag. I did have one day of low ping due to server issues but they got that fixed fairly quick.

THE BAD

- As I've said, there are plenty of guns (50+), but most of them are either sub machine guns or assault rifles. You're more limited in selection of rifles and other types.
- The game uses BattlEye anti-cheat system. If you have a bad week, then have a few days where you're doing good, you can get banned. Pretty much in every match I play, I see someone getting kicked by anti-cheat even though I did not see them hacking. BattlEye is notorious for being a horrible anti-cheat system. I personally have no bad experiences with it, so this is just a point that others have said and what I have seen.
- [IN MY OPINION], the choice of maps you have for TDM is limited. At the time of writing this review, there are 10 maps for TDM. There are more maps than this, but the rest are specifically for other game modes. I'm just one of those people who likes having many different environments to explore, so this may not be such a negative to someone else.

IGNORE WHAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID

- Many reviewers complain about hackers. While inevitably, there are trolls who will hack. But it's not as commonplace as reviewers seem to think. Most instances of people ""shooting through walls"" is more that the raycast of the bullet slightly clips it, but that is a programming error rather than someone hacking. I've seen very few hackers in my nearly 15 hours of playtime (the time Steam says is mostly AFK), and I'm not 100% they were hacking!

IN CONCLUSION

This is currently the best FPS I've ever played. It's very smooth and has a variety of game modes to keep things interesting! It even has a bot TDM mode so you can warm up so you don't drop in ranks in real matches (caution: AI is shit). Is not pay to win at all. Awesome skins for weapons and your name badge. Physics seem really smooth and no bugs that I've found yet.

9/10. Is a very solid FPS. I don't see me ever getting tired of this!"
14970,Fantastic Game !
14971,"Like a mix of CS:GO and COD, really fun in competitive, probably the best free to play shooter."
14972,"How to be a Black Squad Partner? I want to be a Black Squad Partnership....
pls Give me a items! Black Squad Partnership Items :D"
14973,"So i only played a few games. as a free to play game it isn't bad. Technically you can spend real money to unlock new weapons, so kinda falls into the pay to win aspect. The player models moved... but there wasn't any head bob or real hitbox movement so shooting the enemies players is super easy compared to a more polished game. If you want a basic call of duty for free this game is perfect, but if you are looking for a shooter with depth or a target practice game to polish your skills without ruining your K/D on PUBG, COD or fortnite... this really won't cut it. You're getting something closer to Doom 2 with aiming.  Didn't really fit my needs, but as a FTP game it's basically a free counterstrike without the sweaties."
14974,VERI GUD JAME
14975,"garbage, glad its free. you want a good free fps go play csgo. 
it amazes me how you can drill someone in this game and do nothing yet die to someone who is facing in the wrong direction or to people with guns with crap accuracy yet never miss.
i have no idea if its lag, crap hit boxes or hacking or a combo of all plus some other things.
basically it just becomes really annoying."
14976,my friend calvin is/was a big fan of this game
14977,"Great game especially for free. Plenty of players most of the time wait times aren't any longer than overwatch. reminds me of call of duty ghosts but I really like how the guns handle. ONly thing i really question is, is there any damage drop off on any weapon I'm tired of getting one shotted from an smg from accross the map. Sometimes ill have a weapon with way more power get like a body shot and 2 headshots from 10ft and I get one shotted by a weaker weapon. Overall though it's got me playing daily."
14978,Great game! if you are into FPS then you have to play Black Squad. You can play co op against BOTS or just jump in a multiplayer shootout.

14995,"This is utterly terrible. The original assassin's creed PC ports had vastly better user interfaces. The tutorial is awful (at teaching how to play, being interesting, and not being confusing).

I had to alt-tab out and back in just to get the game to show anything other than an all white screen.

Would not recommend over playing with some marbles or ants on the floor.

""But it's early access!"" you say? I'm a web developer, and I can recognize bad user interfaces. I've seen plenty of better interfaces designed by 100% clueless people who only put in a little effort. This isn't a case of ""whoops, first draft mistakes"", this is ""I really don't care""."
14996,Hackers paradise.
14997,"Blacksquad is an okay game. Good for casual and first-time fps people
It is truly free to play with no pay to win items, as you can earn every and any gun eventually. 
Default and gold guns are okay but, there are free “DLC” packages that gives you some medal guns for a limited time
The game has realistic line of sight and some unique game modes.
In all my time playing I have found very little hackers (3) and 1 suspect person, I believe in battle eye 

This is where the criticism begin:
-There are only a handful of guns worth using
AR: AKs and their variants (vary ever so slightly on dmg and rof) (I had a 3+ kdr before experimenting rigorously by getting at least 1k kills with most gold guns and most metal guns dropping to a ~2.6 kdr, avg about a 2 kdr each game)
SR: AXMC (other SRs are very similar to AXMC but this is the best)
Most guns feel the same

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PoFBwfHWkXIPBDWYDOtsSZLqKmRkb6yaMMNWD16uhQU/edit?usp=sharing

-Flash grenades are basically useless, they only flash when on the ground
-Deathmatch maps are largely symmetrical, and all have a similar uninspiring 3 path design
-Demolition maps have a favored sided
-Matchmaking (QM and custom) is usually stacked to 1 side, you are ether camping in the other team or you are getting camped in (this maybe because of the map design although I see more that high kdrs are just grouped together) 
-Laggers' advantage - laggers are over compensated for as they always see you first around corners and peeks before they even appear on your screen

I have been seeing more and more sleazy tryhards, people with aks and 200+ ping, abusing the lag mechanic"
14998,good Game
14999,Not worth the time to type more.... Don't download!
15000,"Awesome game ! i like the gameplay it's so far the others FPS games, the SFX of hiting enemies looks so realistic.. in one word i reccomend this game to play .."

15003,I think its a very cool fast pace game that lots of people will enjoy
15004,"Black squad is a decent game, the best way to describe it is a CS:GO Port to unreal engine for free. It is not a pay to win game, they've done a good job so far with that. All micro-transactions are cosmetic, even though some different player skins do give something of an advantage as the visual target is smaller or differently shaped than the hit box. Hackers are less of an issue than they used to be. Overall, try it out, it's a pretty game, the gun play is alright, the mechanics are decent and development is ongoing.
7/10"
15005,dogshit
15006,it's nice free game
15007,"Really good game, not too many cheaters that I'm aware of. I'd like to see them implement a matchmaking system and ranked play beyond clan matches, but I like all the different modes and maps. Pretty nice player base overall. Though Black Squad doesn't support voice chat, discord is easy enough to use. Not P2W, but there are some cool skins you may want to buy."

15012,Nice game!
15013,"After roughly 100 hours, I feel like I can geniunely recommend this game for everyone, especially who's looking for a free to play multiplayer game with decent anticheat and polished gameplay.

If you are a newcomer and don't want to be (literally) annihilated by pro players; before you accuse everyone for cheating make sure you grasp the gameplay. Play with bots, try different weapons, learn what buttons do what etc. before you jump into an online game. Quick matches does not match you with players with similar skills to you so you might end up in a lobby of pro player who've played the game hundreds of hours.

Now that out of the way, I have to clear one more thing: this game is NOT pay to win. You can kill anybody with any type of weapon if you're good enough, even with the starter weapon TAR-21. Some of the guns have high damage and high recoil, some of the guns have low damage but low recoil and shoots fast, some of the guns are mishmash of those things. Pick the most suitable gun for you, most of them come with laser sights, silencers and grenade launchers so buy them instead of stock ones if you can. You have 3 different sets for 3 different playstyles; you can edit them however you want. All the purchaseable things are cosmetics, whether it's for your arsenal or for your character and does not affect the gameplay.

Most desirable thing about this game is short game lenghts. Unless you're looking for competitive or Bomb Plant games, you'll spend 10 minutes on each game at most. This is especially great when you're waiting a game to download or just want to kill some quick time. Animations and sounds are great, and even below average PCs can run it at stable 60FPS. Battleye anticheat is good too, you can occasionally see players getting banned in chat menu, even before they join to the game with cheats.

TLDR; a great free game to kill some free time. It has decent graphics, and animations/sounds are the better than most of the f2p games. I would recommend it."

15024,"[h1]Although it's free to play, I quite enjoy this game and will continue to play it.[/h1]

[b][u]Pros[/u] ~[/b]
-Many weapon choices
-Buying weapon cosmetics gives you the weapon as well
-Currently a 0.99 and 4.99 sale on ingame currency worth $5 and $20
-Game mechanics heavily influenced by Counter Strike (such as, ""Don't move and you'll shoot straight."")
-Microtransaction weapons are actually reasonably priced and there are free ways to earn most weapons and cosmetics
-Customizable crosshair
-Able to change coloration filter in-game
-A lot of content available to new players
-Runs extremely well and I keep the FPS capped at 144hz

[b][u]Cons[/u] ~[/b]
-Seemingly 64 tickrate servers even though there's support for 144hz monitors
-Occaisional latency spikes (though maybe due to server location in correlation to myself in Mississippi, and no other game has this issue with me)
-No voice chat as of yet
-Some game modes and maps feel slightly one sided depending on spawn side/team. (Especially in respect to snipers)
-Awkwardish enemy health indicator"
15025,Nice game!
15026,Good game :)
15027,Best ever created
15028,Noice game. It would be amazing if you guys could add weapon customization.
15029,fun game but too less maps
15030,very very fun game
15031,"Things that are needed to be fix as of this post

- Team Balancing : Some players who are level 30-40 are worse than me (Level 20) both teammates and/or enemy. Most times I realised that the low rankers are always better than the high ones, its almost as if the ranks are inverted and people are becoming more bad as they rank up.

- Sniper quickscoping ability : Now I have not been quickscoping myself, however I have experienced players just rushing with a sniper of any sort and just quickscoping the fuck out of me. Players would be rushing around the map and just quickscoping players at chokepoints. Althought there is art and skill to fast peeking with a Sniper - like peeking around a corner and counter strafing as you scope in and take the shot, it is really stupid for a player to just jump around or peek corners and just right click and then left click at the same time and be so accurate. Try decreasing the accuracy of the Snipers at the point of instant scope and gradually has perfect accuracy as the players stays scoped in. This should be within 1 second of scope time, anything less or more would disallow players to do aggresive fast peek like I mentioned earlier.

*** BUGS : 
- Happened atleast twice of my 40 hours play time. Where someone would be kicked for high ping/unstable ping and his character would still exist in the server but not physically there. So it would be a 4v5 but after the enemy kills all 4 of us, the round doesnt end even with or without bomb planted. The Vipers still need to hunt for the non existing 5th guy. Then when a new player takes the Kicked Player spot, it would become a 6v5, and despite killing all 5 of the actual players, they still need to kill the last non existing player that is somehow on the scoreboard and/or top of the UI player counter. After some rounds the Kicked Player would appear physically but I assume isn't there in reality and probably in a different match room and it would be a physical 6v5 and the Vipers/Peace Makers need to kill an extra player to end the round.

- Happened recently after the update for fixing the tab in/out black/white screen. I would be loaded into the game same time as my friends in a 5v5 but it will take me up to 2 full rounds for it to fail its loading before telling me that it lost connection to server or an error of 00x0000001/00x0000000 (something along those lines). It has happened atleast 3/5 times when I play, however everything is alright because it will kick you back to the lobby and you can rejoin again but it's really a pain in the ass expecially if you lost that 2 rounds and knew you could have contributed to the team.

- Might not be a bug and just coincidence but I thought you guys might wanna check it out ASAP before someone start exploiting it for ez steam funds : So if you go to random box tab and purchase the gold random box, and say you get Frontier Box, you could exit from the random box tab once/twice and then go back in to purchase it, you would get the same item. I have done it for atleast up to 3 purchase times in 5 different days. however it is not as consistent or could be just a coincidence. But like I said, worth checking it out to prevent inflation of economy. God knows there might be some cunts out there that knew this was a thing and are keeping 100 or more frontier boxes for themselves and waiting for the right time to sell.

-FPS Issue : Ah, a main focused point for noobs to talk about. I understand it is still in early access and low FPS is always a thing with new games. But personally I dont find it a disadvantage because it is still playable and I can kill players no problem with 144hz refresh rate on a stable 120-190 fps. However I was just curious why its only giving me so little FPS when my rig is a Core i7-6700 at 3.4hz, GPU of MSI 1070 4gb RAM and 18GB of DDR4 Highspeed RAM.

Things to take not of : The skins and different type of guns are a neat thing for different players playstyle. I really love that you can choose your own type of AK in terms of Sights/Loudness/Look etc like the AK12/AK47/AEK and what not with same stats but different visual and attachments. It would be great if you guys can add on purchasable attachments such as Red Dots, Silencers, Holo Sights, ETC BUT NOT Shit like Tripods/Grips to boosts stats such as accuracy or Stability. If you wanna add that shit, its only cosmetics. Red Dots/Silencers/ Sights in general would be amazing if players can customize their own sights to suit their comfortability rather than needing to buy a different set of AK with same stats but different visuals. Silencers however I feel like it needs to be a bought item, because that shit is OP in a 1vX situation when the enemy can silenced himself and kill players 1 by 1 especially when the team doesnt have Voice comms through discord or Teamspeak because you dont show up on the minimap if you have a silencer on and players who are new or learning the game wouldnt know where his teammate died from or where the enemy is because there isnt any voice comms or proper team chat. Which brings me to the next point where you guys should add voice comms into the game or make it so that dead teammate can type to live players who are clutching. (Maybe you could already do that, but most of the time I dont see dead teammates chat until I die and then I can see them from the point I died onwards)
So instead of seperating ""Observer"" And ""Alive"" players in chat, make it so that its a whole team chat it self and those who are dead have a tag beside telling the team or players that they are dead. Example : *dead* Official_eMpTy : Last guy at B. 

Hope to see this taken into consideration in the next patch or next community blog post so I can see whats up. If the any devs need me to test something or give more feedback at any time, please contact me on steam for my email address so we could further discuss any thing.

This game is a great game for what it is as of its early access. Just a few more minor tweaks and proper solid useful add ons to the game will make it a proper game of its own."

15035,"No Such thing as team balance, Half the time when you dig into someone they are left on 1 health regardless, Half of the community uses cheats, The game requires no skill, which may be very good for some people, that is if you are willing to get t-bagged by a five year old when getting a 7 day use grenade."
15036,"Imagine CSGO and COD had a baby. It was vaccinated, developed autism and this is the result. Only recommend if you enjoy living through stage 4 cancer."
15037,"This game was a huge surprise. I wasn't expecting much from a free to play shooter but It was exactly what I've been seeking for a long time. 

Why do I so strongly recommend you give this game a try?

First and foremost. Its free! There is no subscription and you can unlock all the guns from just playing the game. If you want a certain gun with a certain appearance you may need to spend some money but I have consistantly unlocked top tier weapons from simply playing matches. There is a temporary weapon system that means occasionally when you level up or complete a daily/weekly etc objective you get a chest that can award you a random gun with special appearances. I'll be honest. I've never gotten a permanent weapon this way so I'm not sure if its possible BUT the temp weapons stay with you for 1-3 days and allow you to test out a wide array of guns that you would otherwise need to buy before you discovered you didn't like how they felt.

Community: There is a strong community of players so you never wait too long for a match. The first match of the day can sometimes take 2-3 minutes at worst and after that its much faster. There is the obvious smack talk that goes with every shooter game but I've met a lot of people who will really just chat/team up/help others.

Downsides:

Maps: Honestly the map design is the weakest part of the game. I do love most of the maps but some maps are dominated by a single weapon type which makes those matches less than exciting to people who dont want to use that gun type (ok I'm talking about Sniper Rifles). 

In addition to maps I wish there was a way to collect/pick/choose what attachments are on your gun but all the guns are pre-built with certain attachments and they cant be changed. Even the reticles are unchangeable. Its a small thing but I find myself using guns that have a red dot sight more than other types just for that reason and thats kinda silly.

Overall I'm thrilled with this game and encourage you to give it a shot. Play a few matches and see if its for you. All you can lose is a bit of your time (and maybe the matches if you are facing off against me jk!) I hope to see you soon!"
15038,"Very good free fps, This is the best free steam game."

15045,"This is probably the best online FPS I have played for ages.
Graphics looks good, gameplay is great, and you don't have to be ""pro"" to have fun.

There are tons of weapons to choose from and they feel well balanced, and although there are one-shot-kills weapons, they are severly capped in movement speed, fire speed, reload speed and clip size, so it evens out.

The base verson of every weapon you need to buy can be baugth with basic in-game currency, and only the skins require premium currency, so there is no Pay-to-Win factor at all.

There are also several game modes, but some require a fair amount of patience before there are enough players ready, but the standard team deathmatch are always available."
15046,Good game. kuy
15047,"7/10 for this game. I quite like this game actually, looks pretty much like a free version of a call of duty game. But, it is based on how much you pay extra on the game. If you don't pay for the guns that are actually good, the starter ones are just a mosquito bite that you can't kill somebody with 30 god damn shots. And the pistol is just poo poo. And also, I don't know why my game kept crashing and kicked me out mid-game. And the FPS was really low while loading in."

15064,"OK- 100/10 AMAZING
The only way to describe this game would be that you put CS:GO, CoD Modern Warfare III ( or any of the CoD games, really), and Rainbow Six Siege all in a blender, and added the name Black Squad. This isn't to take away from the awesomeness of the game, however. Since all of the aforementioned games cost quite a bit of money altogether, this game is the perfect solution to your case of free-to-play-itus. It has a diverse range of easily accessible weapons that only contribute to the playstyle of every kind of CS:GO player out there. There are the infamous CoD kill medals, rewarded for finishing a player. For the Rainbow Six players, there are demolition, VIP assassination, and battle match modes. With a unique weapon arsenal and 3 accessible loadouts mid match, you can spend mindless hours on your computer, have all of your favorite weapons, and KICK ASSS without paying a dime.

15066,"Edited review:

After they changed the matchmaking in this game, I barely have fun. I don't count myself to the pro players in Black Squad and that's the issue here. Whenever you reached a certain rank, you will only get into a match with no lifers that will give players that just want some casual fun no chance. And I dont even play ranked, just casual matchmaking which makes it even worse. I spent a lot of time into this game but I lost joy in it since all those changes."

15081,"Trash game. Umbalanced, guns are trash, everything is bad about this game... but again, its free.  I played 70min in quick match... with the SAME people over and over, eventhough I left the room a couple times."
15082,"10% joined a game
90% error ""disconnect from the server 0x000000000000000000000""
9/10 errors
thx for free 1$ (in cases)"
15083,"Tha game was lit i like it 
it makes me very happy 
+rep plis
"
15084,nice game sometime is to many hack but the game is still good
15085,a good game ;)
15086,"Its good CUZ its free 
Otherwise some rules in the game is very disappointing .
But a good time pass if u play with ur frenzzz"
15087,NICE GAME :)
15088,لعبة فله
15089,خخخخخ
15090,"big tiddy bitches
"
15091,Horrible team balance.  I don't want to have Newbies on my Rank. Against a whole team of Marshals. Not reccomending the game to anyone until the balancing issue isn't fixed.
15092,A game u can play for ever....COD/CS;go
15093,"Idk, ok i guess"
15094,Very good alternative for CS:GO....
15095,really good game to me it feels like counter strike
15096,"Kinda like game for browser, but can be really fun and nice if u play with ur friends
7,5/10"
15097,the hackers in this crap game is insane. its unreal how easy it is to get hacks with mommies credit card
15098,"Toxic community
Full of hackers
Bad optimization
In conclusion, it's a nice free p2w game."
15099,all i see is a white screen. thats all i see. doesnt even show me it loading. my friend plays it fine but i cant even get it to load.
15100,Very cool! Fell in love first time I saw it.
15101,"Pretty fun game. Good to play if you just wanna get a few quick pvp matches in. Small CS go style maps. Its a constant shooting RNG style FPS  for sure. Little lag spikes here and their, nothing that really brakes the game.
Only thing that annoys me, is the random boxes you can buy with the in game currency. It says ""A random box containing a PERMANENT item."" Ive bought 5 of these boxes... only one contained a permanent item. The rest gave me things that only last for 1-3 days... I had to go back and double check what the word ""permanent"" ment in the dictionary... going by what Webster has to say, permanent doesnt describe an item that you only have for 1-3 days.   
Other than that.. Its FREE and its fun, so I like it."
15102,nice
15103,Better than Csgo tbh
15104,this game needs to be X-Box controller supported. Until then; 1 star rating
15105,its quite bad
15106,game doesnt work anymore.
15107,the worst pay2win shit I even played
15108,Is nice!
15109,"Alter Schwede... ich habe noch nie einen Egoshooter gespielt, bei dem die Steuerung so... ""seltsam"" und 
""unintuitiv"" ist."
15110,"Black Squad defnitly fun, it almost feels like CoD and CS made a love chiled, pre-game  GUI needs some serious work as things feels very cluttered, but overall game is real fun, gunplay is solid, in 3hrs I was entertained.

If you looking for a pew pew title that is F2P and will keep you occupied look no further Black Squad will fill the void for you

as a side note, everything you can buy with real money is only cosmectic as far as i could tell, so no pay to win here.

7/10  -- would be higher if they overhaul the pre-game GUI"
15111,just an other shooter with mirracle snipers
15112,Really good game!
15113,"It you like the Quake 3 feel, you'll love this game. 
It feels like the same game mechanics as Q3, but with COD style weapons. I hate COD, but this game is good fun.
"
15114,Nice Game
15115,black squad on the other free game
15116,"Awesome FPS game! Looks great and movement and firing mechanics are good and sort of realistic. Character models are well-made. Daily events and rewards make it worth doing. NOT pay to win since the good guns can be bought by medals, which you can earn by simply playing quick matches. Only issue is the Frontier Boxes, which can only be opened by purchasing keys with real money.

update:
you can now earn keys to open crates on a monthly basis. good job!"
15117,для педиков
15118,This is such a bullshit game where you can play against lvl. 20 players when you just started the game and the best thing in the game is that you never shoot there where you crosshair is but you can still get 1 tapped trough the wall.
15119,"One really good game. I've only played 4 hours one night and I was hooked, and for the nice price of free it's worth every penny."
15120,"i always liked this type of games,the interface is the better that i ever see."
15121,"cant play as of the latest update, just tries to trap me in a white screen"
15122,"loved the game downloaded it when it first came out but dont play it that much



still love the fucking game thoght
"
15123,"This game is huge ! 
i like it so much 
but the maps are CT sided thats the only problem"
15124,"I have actually zero clue as to why people even play this game, the mechanics and gun play are alright but it has insane killstreaks, terrible balance etc. Sentry guns are like bloody tanks to kill but do no dmg?????? what was the thought process on this it seems really dumb. 
This game is literally worse than COD in every aspect and somehow it's positively rated.
Once again baited by reviews to play a bad game.


I couln't forget off course the gernade spam, in any first person ""shooter"" if there's gernade spam you know it's gonna be bad."
15125,gud game (like dis comment makes u want to play dis game but actually it is gud ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
15126,"This game is fun. It is enjoyable to play when you're kind of board, for a generic shooter, it is pretty fun. I know I haven't played a lot of this game but here is what I like/dislike:

There are a few things that I want to see change:
-It feels like a tactical shooter, but at the same time the time to kill makes it feel like a cod-esc game.
-Reduce nade damage. Holy crap everytime I spawn a nade gets me down to 30 hp and then I get one tapped by every gun in the game.
-There are a handful of guns that are just straight up broken. Sometimes I shoot the person 6 times and they turn and shoot me twice and I die. I don't know if this is because I am down 70 hp because of nade-spamming.
-Some maps are bad and need a bit of work. A lot of the time an enemy can just walk up to your spawn with a broken weapon and just kill you and all your teamates.

There are a lot of things I like, too, including:
-Buying new guns is very simple and doesn't require physical money. (Guns are also fairly priced)
-Clans are a great way to reach out to the community and get better at the game, while still having very competitive clan matches.
-Switching between loadouts is simple, it allows you to adapt to different maps and how the enemy team plays.

Overall I like the game, but I would enjoy and play it a lot more if they made these changes to make it more balanced."
15127,Best white screen simulator of 2018.
15128,i like my dreams as my blood jhepoy dizon
15129,"Very good for a free game. Similar to CS, especially with all the skins. But it's a very immersive FPS."
15130,Stress reliever
15131,without money this game is best
15132,Shit game
15133,"this game looks pretty kooL butt playing it is a different story, it needs more work."
15134,"Temporary items, lootboxes, and 4 different types of currency.

Yikes.

Although for some reason shotguns feel super good in this game, despite the fact that you can't stop reload animations which means you'll be running and jumping around like an idiot while your character puts in more shells 1-by-1."
15135,its good graphiced
15136,"A great starter for people wishing to get into the FPS genre, even if it does have in-app purchases"
15137,Game was always iffy but coming back after a long break and finding nothing but snipers and cheaters .... no thanks. Not even worth your time for free.
15138,I don't know why but I like it. ;)
15139,OMG FUNNY GAME :D
15140,I like it
15141,I used to absolutely LOVE the game but in the last few months one error after another has been coming up due to BattlEye - I attempted repeatedly to contact support from both the game developers and BattlEye to get around the problem and get them fixed even including logs and videos - and every email sent to them has been ignored whether its directly to their support email or via the support on their websites. More often than not the game is proving to be unplayable and the support from both sources seems non-existant.
15142,"Great game if you have an i5 7200 , 8 GB ram and GeForce 940 boosted and still have 3 fps in main menu on lowest settings"
15143,"Old graphics, clunky gameplay, resembles original shooters so nostalgic for some. Crashes if you try shift tab"
15144,Its a free shooter and actualy its not that bad
15145,Full of Hackers. Game is Dead.
15146,"I played the game ages ago then uninstalled it but decided to play it again and once i installed it i had a problem, the game would launch but then crash and i would gat a message saying blocked loading file and i have tried what i could to fix it but nothing will work hopefully a patch comes out to fix this problem"
15147,This is insane! Good Game!!
15148,"Very good game and it's free my dudes.
Very well optimised to making it run great on any pc.

Only one thing, pls can you give an option to disable music in main menu as it is so annoying hearing the heavy metal all the time. Hope this game becomes famous"
15149,"This game has everything,It's fast pacing and it F2P and you don't need to P2P like I didn't invest any money in this game and I won't plus I got a lot of good guns without even using any hacks or cheats and yes I know that the game gives you free weapons to test them out 

                                                PS:If you see this Comment you should consider to Play this game it is really fun and the 
                                                hackers are gona get banned and the game will get a good anti-cheat"
15150,"dont bother. most of the players use wall hax. played for 10 hours and seen 1 person kicked for cheating almost every match
limited map size and has NO vehicles, the game feels very unrealistic. This is a bad game"
15151,"I tried this game with very low expectations and still was let down.

Variety on guns is almost non-existent (including the cashop), after so many f2p shooters on the market with a wide variety of pistols, submachineguns, assault rifles and light machineguns on their arsennals one would expect more than 2 choices per type of weapon in this game...

Another bad aspect of this game is that the looks of your character is determined by pre-designed characters that you must buy with real money which happens to be a HUGE letdown for players like me that enjoy to custom their own looks.


Black squad devs, if you really want players to pay real money or grind their fingers to the bone, at least give them solid reasons to do that, give them more weapon-variety, give them customizable characters per bodypart-slots, maybe even provide them character progression through class-unlocks or gear-unlocks..."
15152,It's Free to Play. But that doesn't mean it should not be good. For me it was enough to play one match against bots to see  the dynamic and physics. It's not good. Wouldn't recommend it.
15153,"Black Squad is a nice little tactical wannabe Socom/CS:GO like game, pretty fluid for early access, though you can see where it needs improvements. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking to burn the itch for CS:GO or Classic Socom style of play without actually playing those games. 

P.S. burn some, then play. it makes it better :D"
15154,cool and fun with friends tbh
15155,"Good, free FPS game with a lot of game modes,
Good alternative to other shooters if you cant afford them, and no where near as toxic as csgo. Also more fun and more casual"
15156,TAC RELOAD !
15157,"black squad? more like white squad. XDDD

my nigee this white screen go HARD ASF"
15158,"This game is trash
- Team balance is the worst ever in any game I have seen so far, get used to play versus all highranked with a team of bots
- on startup I have a white screen since weeks and it doesn't get fixed, known issue in the community
- whenever I type something in chat, the screen goes black and I have to Alt+Tab in order to get the game back (sometimes works, sometimes doesn't)
- full of cheaters, no killcam, no way to report suspicious gamers
The developers are clearly too lazy to fix the bugs, but instead they add more stuff to buy. Happy summer time, you get weapons with new skins, but the bugs you have to live with. Looks like a cheap version of counterstrike now.
Uninstalled."
15159,"If you needed a super-cheap version of Warface and Call of Duty that can run on potato-machines, Black Squad is definitely your thing.

However whilst this might sound uncharitable, I probably wouldn't buy anything from the ingame store unless you genuinely either loved the developers or had no other possible freemium FPS you could play."
15160,"Pretty decent F2P game. You can't pay to become OP, you can only buy skins. Weapons are permanent too. Even though you can aim down the sight, in most cases it's better not to. The game is closer to CSGO than COD. Netcode is decent too, wepon balance is just fine, there are no clearly OP weapons in the game. Most gamemodes are restricted to guns only, but in ""battle match"" you can use killstreaks too, which are pretty fun and make the game chaotic without sacraficing balance. I say give it a go, you have nothing to lose and it's easy to sink into the gameplay, and have fun."
15161,I don't know why I like it. But I like it.
15162,"EA blushes when they hear about the progression system in this game.

But everything else is pretty fun though."
15163,"Great fun and good shooter
"
15164,"plenty of cheaters and I can't even report!!! so, no one cares!! (no they have report feature, haven't try it yet tho)
looks like no one play in it, it's hard to find a room to play, was waiting for 5-10 mins and no game was found..."
15165,"If you've recently just built a PC, and love S&D games, but your dead broke and want something to play until you arent, I reccomend this. Even though I've onlyplayed the tutorial level, I think Ive seen enough."
15166,yote it just dont work man
15167,"Yep, played 5 matches, it was grenade spam the whole time"
15168,Game just updated. NOW IT WILL NOT LOAD!!!Another great move by stream.  First COD4 Now Black Squad.
15169,The game is really good but too many items can only be bought by real currency so some shoule be affordable with  Gold in-game currency instead of Bullets in-currency
15170,this is another free pay to win shitty physics shooter dont download this game please it wastes too much storage on ur pc. id rather have 4k granny porn instead of this shitty game on my pc
15171,"I recommend this game to everyone cause it's like a free version of csgo and a good version of CSNZ
"
15172,"This game is just pay to win, all the good guns are locked behind a pay wall."
15173,"I really enjoy this game, it's like an alternative to CS and is a really great game. Solid shooting, movement and maps. Biggest problem that I have with the game, is no Aussie servers, so I have to play with over 150 ping which is almost impossible to get a really good feel for the game's weapon mechanics and such, but after a while you get it. If they added Australian servers and some new weapons to make the game a bit more fresh, it'd be a solid 8/10. However in the state it's in, it's more like a 6 or a 7/10. If you're Australian, just stick with CS because you will have a lag free experience on CS. If you're American or Asian, this is a really fun game and provides a unique experience."
15174,"Very good game, especially when it's for free! Sure, you can buy some things for real money, but you actually in many situations don't have to because the game is good like it is! I absolutely reccomend it for people who likes FPS shooters. I see this game competing with CS:GO in future. but time will say!"
15175,"Just your typical below average free to play shooter. No FOV slider, clunkey movement. 
If you thought COD map sizes where a joke then you should see this game. Although you
can buy permanent weapons, most of them are time based. So after a couple of days the
weapon disappears. Look for another shooter to play then this shite, definitely not worth
your time."
15176,addicting!!
15177,Is a good shoooter!
15178,"Honestly haven't had this much consistent fun with a shooter since UT2004.

Upsides:
+ No pay-to-win. I could easily top the leaderboards of my team with the starter weapons.
+ Quick action, very short time-to-kill.
+ Active community, commonly less than 30 seconds wait time on North American servers.
+ Low Toxicity: Have had people reciprocate a GG and GL HF almost every game thus far.
+ Sound Design. The guns are nice and chunky, feeling like they've got some oomph behind them. Movement sounds are crisp, voice commands are clear, and you can sometimes navigate just using sound, much like in CS:GO.

Downsides:
- The Grind. If it weren't for the current summer event, it'd take quite a while to afford any of the guns. Luckily unlike Combat Arms, they're all Permanent. So once you buy one, it's yours.
- TINY maps. Some maps you can even watch as your enemies spawn. There IS a spawn shield, but it's often not long lasting enough for them to get out of range.
- Very minor customization. Personally, I love games that allow a crazy amount of character customisation. There are a few options out there for varying models, but none of the alts are really up my alley. A very minor gripe to be sure.
- Volume. The game is REALLY FREAKIN' LOUD. Even using the audio sliders, I've had to adjust the game itself below 50% on my PC, just so I don't go deaf from getting a headshot on someone.
- Weapon Variety. While the weapons sound great and are plentiful, for the most part they're just slightly adjusted variants of eachother. In terms of balance, this is great, but in terms of customisation (again, I'm a sucker for that stuff) it's a little dry. 

Overall, I'd say give it a try. It's free, it's a fairly small download, and it plays well even on a potato PC such as mine. (Still running a GTX 760, for those curious.)

The game itself is fun, the balance is something taken very seriously, and the community seems alright. I recommend this to anyone looking for a more arcade / action based shooter as opposed to something more strategic / realistic. I know I love it, and I'm hoping some of the ""old guard"" of shooters enjoy it as much as I do."
15179,trash
15180,"really good overall
"
15181,this game is lekka
15182,Very nice
15183,I really like it
15184,"Black squad is an amazing F2P Multiplayer FPS, with a whole array of characters, banners, weapons and more. The game is fun, addictive, and it almost can never be played solo, which is what makes it such a great co-op game. 
However, no game is without sin, so I'll cover everything I've encountered myself.

PROS 
- Many decorative weapons and cards to express yourself.
- No actual PTW. (You can pay money for things, but they're almost all cosmetics, not essentials.)
- A whole array of unique maps and gamemodes, which (props to the devs) are really well designed.
- A diverse community of players.
- Great gunplay.
- Fantastic graphics, audio, and high polygon modelling.

CONS (Sorry devs I still love you <3)
- There seems to be a lot of hacking. Almost every match someone shoots me through a wall halfway across the map.
- You either have to wait to earn, or buy the currency to purchase a female character model, which I in paticular dislike as a female.
- Grenade spamming is everywhere.
- Enemy team loves to camp at your spawn and obliterate everyone.

That's personally what I've encountered, and I'm sure people have seen more, but overall, I'd say check out Black Squad! It's worth the $0.00!"
15185,"i think this is great game,good graphic,,i think u should put Sprint for faster movement"
15186,gooooooooooood
15187,Its a really good fps shooter which helps with the reaction traning for the player and can be played in almost every specs
15188,"Very Nice game to play :)

Highly Recommended :)"
15189,The game is excellent and free
15190,"ok, so first, good game.
second, the no pay to win thing is absolute bullsh*t
third, i reccomend it because the gameplay is pretty smooth"
15191,Nice Game
15192,"Hardly any new content from the developers. The most you'll ever get are imported contents from the Korean version (Mostly weapon skins). Gets boring after a while, because everything feels repetitive. Long-term players would end up dropping this game, because of no newer content made by the developers. NA competitive is dead, the developers doesn't do anything about it. There's still hit registration issues. All guns should have recoil, but in this game some guns literary don't have any recoil. Stupid cosmetics like ""walking path glow"" and character glow. It lack contents and fixes to the game. Other than that the game can be fun, but after a while, it just feels dull to me."
15193,this is a good game! have been playing it for almost a year and it brought me alot of joy! thank you BS! :)
15194,"Game is OK, nothing special. Would probably be half way decent if it didnt have so many aimbot/wallhacks playing. Also could call this a Grenade spam Sim, for as small as the maps are there shouldnt even be grenades. All people do is spam grenades and when you can throw a grenade from spawn to the other persons spawn , what would you expect. Game would be much better without them. Oh and the tutorial is GOD AWFUL thank god its short.

Other than that the game is nicely done. Decent graphics, Smooth gameplay, didnt see any lagging or jitter from anyone. For a free game its worth a go at it for sure."
15195,"The Game is Just Good..
Yeap you heard correctly this game is extremely nice i only have 9 hours but counting the game optimization is meh micro transactions well tbh the game has some of them but dont think they are limited i guess they are permenate after you buy them and no you dont really need to spend a penny to this game cause the game itself has a free currency that you get by completing mission or just playing full matches and you even get rewards sometimes the graphics are really like Rainbow Six as well as the maps but they are exept outside yeah there are a lot of noob campers but still nice the community isnt toxic yet so as i said the game is pretty well made graphics are good maps are good the devs arent made this game pay to win yet so overall the game is a combination of Zula the base Rainbow Six as like salt and add a bit of CSGO in the game is pretty ok and well made you dont really need to spend much money to be like the best but you might want to throw in a bunch of cash to support the devs and improve yourself faster"
15196,this has to be one the best fps game i have played online :: it is super outstanding and it has made me love this game even more everyday
15197,boring and bad
15198,"This game just isn't very good. Getting kills is easy due to the small map size but highly unsatisfying, I experienced some pretty bad rubberbanding despite having a pretty good ping (89-110), gameplay is repetitive and kinda dull, the maps are boring and last but not least you don't even start with any grenades. If you want to play a good FPS I would suggest that you look elsewhere."
15199,"Solid game, can run on a potato and is strangly entertaining. Really easy to get new guns and items and even if you want to buy the expensive type of in game currency its very reasonable in comparison to other games. I've only come across one hacker so far. If nothing else, use this game to train your aim and stuff for r6 or something. I play it cause its fun."
15200,Meh.....
15201,this game could be better if there is some fix on the laggy and connection from asia. i dont know why when suddenly my character fly and stand on other place.
15202,I love this game my personal opinion I like this game better than CSGO Just wish they had more fun skins and custom clothes for your class
15203,How can this game have so many positive reviews this is ♥♥♥♥ing garbage game
15204,IMAGINE PLAYNG BLACK SQUAD IN 2021 OMEGALUL
15205,"I would say this game is great, it is basically a free CSGO and its mixed with COD the game is just great and I love it. 10/10 Great Game"
15206,Graphic too bad. Maps have quite a lot of problem. Sniper can monolopy a game.
15207,"A pretty decent game that serves as a refreshing break from the battle royale hysteria. Honestly, not sure why this game isn't more popular."
15208,yet another csgo copy. now that csgo is free why waste time on this trash?
15209,good good good
15210,Not bad for a free game. Feels very chinese. Take that how you will.
15211,"Honestly.. no spawn camp protection, no real rank/ skill restrictions. Might be a good game... its not. Pity. Warface is much better...."
15212,"i feel like this game yells at me ""uninstall me already"" especially the loud sounds when you hit someone and the fact that i can't even turn down the volume in the tutorial !?!?!? , is this crossfire+some CoD? good , for a game that would've been decent in year 2004"
15213,Best Free Game Shooter
15214,AUS Servers pls :c
15215,"Blacksquad is a FREE FPS with an EXTREMELY high skill ceiling.

Don't play this game if you're looking for something that's easy.

HOWEVER,

If you're the type of person that devotes a large amount of time into developing skills, then you'll absolutely have a blast with this game.

Already LIGHTYEARS ahead of EVERY other free fps title because it has a decent anticheat.

WARNING: DO NOT PLAY THE TUTORIAL WITH SOUND ON.  YOU WILL GO DEAF"
15216,"Good for a free to play game I guess, so if your into pay to win go for it, also the name sounds racist. Just saying."
15217,"die in a second, idk if they are hacker, better play CSGO"
15218,good game
15219,Fucking Nice Game
15220,<3
15221,"hmm.. Good alternate game, try this game if you want to improve your shooter game skills."
15222,"This game is pretty damn bad, it's pretty much Dirty Bomb but without all the cool stuff Dirty Bomb has. It has so much pay to win bullshit, you get grenades in loot boxes but you can only have them for a week. This game has potential to be an alright free to play call of duty rip off for the computer but the way it's going right now it's everything the gaming community doesn't want in a game. Also it's fucking impossible to use any of the good abilites you learn in the tutorial, if you think you're going to be calling in air strikes, pulling out a mini gun and going to town....boi you will be very VERY disappointed."
15223,the description is an absolute lie. it is VERY pay to win and by far one of the worst f2p shooters ive ever played
15224,Very nice and interesting game. It helps me replace my previous game which is excuted ( A.V.A)
15225,Basically a pay-to-win. It is disgusting. Then the achivement: First step to the empty wallet! What the absolute- *sigh* Yuck...
15226,Booted up the game on North american servers amd all it did was give me a white screen nothing else So for that reason i give it a 0/5 looked like a good game to if this issue is resoloved Im open to change my standing
15227,"AMAZING GAME, LIKE A FREE CS GO"
15228,"Fun gameplay mechanics.

Horrible progression system.

No way to customize guns and they all come with weird attachments.

Bad gun variety.

Fun for the first few matches, can't recommend, just boring afterwards."
15229,You want a free to play CS GO well here you go. This game is Bad just stick to CS GO if you want a game like it. Its got great graphics but gameplay is terrible and controls are something you have to get used to.
15230,A good game. I love playing this when I'm bored cause the queue time for matches isn't long and the community isn't as salty  as other online games.
15231,A pretty much nice Multiplayer Game! But little bit Addictive! xD
15232,"dont waste your time waiting for this game to download,its complete garbage"
15233,Played over 400 hours and still playing ! Amazing game  for every fps gamer . and recently they released trade system and i got over $8 worth of in game items . i have csgo but didn't got anything from csgo yet. definently recomended .

15236,"To buggy and full of exploit/cheaters. in a single lobby i saw 2 aimbots through the walls (as in killing the entire team from there spawn)  and out of the map snipers, and ive only played for an hour. Other than that, its got the makings for a masterpiece. Just needs an anti cheat system."
15237,"Grenade spam
Poor ping for Aus
Tiny maps
Game pace makes no sense on a map so small."
15238,"Great game and no pay to win mechanics. Just put in some time and it is a fun game.

15239,it's very similar to csgo. this game is good. but needs voice chat option ingame
15240,Grenade spam
15241,"Good music
Nice graphics
And thats it ... the rest is everything you can expect from a FPS game. 

Minuses are:
Grinding 
RNG? Boxes 

Now its a decent game, but i bet it will become Pay To Win. If you like Crossfire you will probably like this. My problem is that you can buy weapons which i bet at some point will lead to the p2w and there are colorful granades and smokes. At one point they wont be differentiable."
15242,Pay To Win
15243,"Are the new summer skins going to be able to be sold on the steam market at all because i have got a skin that i want to sell 
 (MDR ice blue) but it doesnt appear on my steam inventory and i am unable to sell it."
15244,"best shotter games 

please update thanks for build this game"
15245,"This is a very relaxed shooter, even in comp game modes. This is what a game should feel like, fun."
15246,"Ah yes, yet another Free-To-Play online FPS game... I'll be honest, I wasn't really expecting a lot from this game, that being said, I was pleasantly surprised.

Let's address the elephant in the room, that being the cash shop and premium items. Yes, there is premium stuff, no, there is nothing you can buy to give you a stat advantage. The only thing money will buy is a currency called Bullets, which are just skin crates. that's it, so far. It's wayy too early to tell if this will evolve into something more sinister, time will tell on that front.

Since that is out of the way, on to the rest of my unduely long review!

Graphically this game looks pretty nice, animations are good, the maps follow their own colour palettes, some are brown and grey, some more colourful. Overall map design is all very simple and easy to get a hold of, the maps are easy to learn and navigate.

Textures look good, haven't seen anything blurry or that stands out as weird, the graphical design is all very coherent if not a bit dull. The guns look very nice and tacticool.

Sounds are good, there are a couple music tracks and they're decent enough, mostly rock\metal style music, some songs sound a little bit quiter than others but it's nothing major. Gun sounds are everywhere from unique and good sounding to mediocre and bland. The starter pistol sounds like an airsoft gun. However you can generally tell the weapon type being fired pretty easily. Footsteps are loud as hell, making walking a very important tactic to employ since it'll make you completely silent.

Gameplay is very reminiscent of Call of Duty meets Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. If you played any of these titles, you'll feel very comfortable in this game. The guns have almost no recoil making assault rifles feel very samey, they mostly are the same aside from varying stats, such as one rifle might do more damage with a slower rate of fire and smaller magazine size, while the other has a much large mag size, and fires faster but has lower damage.

The available primary weapons are Assault Rifles, SMGs, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, LMGs and Designated Marksman Rifles (DMRs). They're all very straight forward, however shotguns in this game are brutal, they can take someone out with a single shot from quite far away, they have barely noticable recoil, and they fire quickly. Basically, matches, especially in Demolitions, will come down to who has the most KSG shotguns on their team, and who sees who first.

Game modes are fairly straight forward.

You have good ol' Team Deathmatch which is addictive.

Demolition 8v8 & 5v5 which is identical to DE defuse game modes in CS:GO, minus the buying.

Assassination, where one team defends a VIP (controlled by a brain dead AI, mind you.) that can die in like 4 shots, as he waddles to a helicopter. The other team has to kill the enemy team and the VIP, or kill the VIP and extract from their own helicopter. This mode is very... meh. It's out of place and not fun.

And last, but not least, Battle Match, where you have to work with your team to destroy the enemy base, which are giant supply crates or something. This mode is where classes come into play, and it's pretty hectic and clearly the main gamemode. It's okay, it's certainly one of the better modes. The maps for it are quite large as well, which is nice.

The combat is very, very fast. The time-to-kill in this game is intensely low, and fire-fights rarely last more than a couple seconds. Pretty much every weapon kills in 2 - 1 headshot, in some cases like the shotguns and close range, headshots aren't even needed to take someone out in a split second.

Grenades in this game, unlike CS:GO, are lethal. While easy to avoid, catching one will seriously injure or just outright kill you from full health.

There is ""sprinting"" in this game, but it's just pulling your knife out ala CS. However the interesting thing here is you have the option to hold a button to take your knife out, and then swap back to the last weapon you had upon button release. It acts like a sort of sprint button, very different feature I've never seen before. Knives themselves are just 1-hit kills if you manage to land a stab, 2 - 3 hits if you just swing it."
15247,"Game doesn't work. Battleye prevents me from playing the game, but I don't have any problems with Conan Exiles which also uses the same service."
15248,"This is one of the best FPS I have played in a long time. With time I have no part of my mind that says this can not be better than any Call of Duty made. With this said even though it being in early access and free to play this is on my list of the best games I have ever played. With most dislikes of the game come from grinding and nade spam. The grinding part is not as bad as everyone says it is. I believe this is from people putting enough time to enjoy the game I see the people that complain about grinding have 20-30 hours most of the time. Although I can agree the nade spam is a problem, but you need to see past all of this to enjoy any game. With installing this game most wonder if it is even worth the space it takes and with it being early access makes people skip over the game when they see it. With almost playing 300~ at the moment and most of it being a free to play I can say this game is not ""Pay 2 Win"". I believe people don't realize most of the people paying money in game are the ones that have hours on hours on playing this game, and they don't have a more powerful weapon than you they just have skill the come with experience. I strongly believe this is a game with great community. While this review is all over the place I know I wrote it. I recommend this game to anyone that is willing to give 
it the try it needs. Over the months I have shown people the ropes of the game and if you see this review and want to learn how to play just add me TheKunz11 in my in game name. If i'm online don't even think twice about it ask me what ever you want to ask. I want this amazing community to grow and help the average new person as well. With all that said i'm allowing comments if anyone to ask questions there or even give their criticism on how bad this review is."
15249,Great game for free
15250,It's not very good
15251,Trash Game lol
15252,"This game is pretty fun. I like to play it when i need to vent off from other games. The mechanics are well made and if you play others FPS games you will easily carry your skills over. It looks like a cod game while it feels like your playing csgo a nice mixture of both if you ask me. 
This game is free to play so there are some micro transactions within the game. But i would say it's not that bad. 
But this game isn't all awesome, it has some flaws like any other game. There are two things i feel like i have to adress in the game. First the loot boxes. 9/10 boxes you're gonna open are gonna contain either nates for a couple of days or you get a skin for a day. So it really feels like nothing. To get these skins permanent you have to buy ingame currency and buy loot boxes. And you're gonna get Smoke and grenates lasting for a year before you get the skin you want. Second the matchmaking is one of the worst i've seen in any game. I play with 2-3 friends when im playing Black Squad and we always either play against people that have several hundreds of hours more than us, or players that literally tries the game for the first time.

Conclusion: I think it's a fun game when i need to vent from other games, but not a game i can sit and play for hours. Definetely worth trying out atleast.

Tip: There are 3x free weapon DLC's that you can download that let's you try all (or most of them) weapons for 15days. So you have two weeks to find a weapon you prefer and then you can spend your free 200k on your favourite weapon when it's time is up."
15253,the best game
15254,nah
15255,Good game
15256,"This is an awesome game, I had this game when it first came out and a lot have changed. Even though i'm not a high rank, its still fun to compete against other players practice and my aiming skills (Aim skill 7)"
15257,"It's a decent FPS that isn't pay to win. Maps are small but depending on mode type they are pretty fun. I mainly play CSGO and Warface and this game is a nice change of pace.
All in all I would give it a go. Its one that you can pick up, leave and come back again without missing out on to much. 

If CSGO and Battlefield were to have an illegitimate child this would be the result."
15258,"A good alternative f2p fps

7/10"
15259,Is a good free game !
15260,This game is amazing... The best of CS and CoD combined.

15262,nice when u shot guns u get a fps  drop so its more immersive
15263,"Pretty good game. 
Graphix are nice  and gameplay is awesome for free to play game. 
I recommend to download it."
15264,add a voice chat :c
15265,"I can understand indie/smaller developers having issues. This is ridiculous though. Game seemed to play well in the tutorial, but when you get to the real game, thats a different story. Playing with a 40-45ms ping and other players have 200+ yet I'm the one rubber banding and teleporting to somewhere I wasn't even going. I cannot play a game that in the first game it's literally impossible to play because when I go to turn a corner, all of a sudden I'm across the corner and being shot. Amazing ""netcode"", riiiiiiiight. Listen, if you're going to play this game, understand that you will either get frustrated to no end, or will quit because of the matching system."

15272,"Recently got this game and at first I was not sure about it. But after a few hours of playing it, it is fun and free. Getting guns is not too hard either
"
15273,10 outta 10 best free fps out there. the only annoying thing about it is when people spam fire a pistol like a f*cking machine gun
15274,"The game is really good and free 
Its not pay to win 
also skins are cheap af"
15275,"Good game, but still need some fixing on the anti- cheat.
Other than that its good."
15276,O.o Needs to really look at the skin market. Good game but its getting over-saturated and there is no function to keep older skins rare and worth buying.
15277,best game
15278,Addictive with many custom game!!
15279,"better than cod
"
15280,Please remind me never ever to download a free-to-play game on steam .
15281,...
15282,"Black Squad is an ""alright"" mediocre Free to Play FPS game.
Anything more than that and it fails spectacularly.

It's fun as long as you don't play it seriously and the lobbies are well balanced.
Other than that the maps are absolutely horrible. They're cramped, completely mirrored but that only makes it worse and the corridor choke points are trash.

The weapons feel ok if you don't mind stupid amounts of recoil that goes everywhere.
It's their idea of ""balancing"" high powered weapons. Give them borderline uncontrollable recoil.

Not that that matters because you'll probably die by someone you couldn't even see until the very last second, the server has already registered you dead at which point he FINALLY comes around the corner he shot you from.

The game could be so much more and so much better but the lacking server performance, tickrate and lag compensation is just absolutely horrible. If you enjoy dying behind cover, being killed by people you can't even see or just dying by what on your end registered as one bullet but in fact was a 15 bullet spray down. This game is it.

I genuinely want to like this but the more I play it the more I start to hate the community and the lacking performance of the game. But it's free to play so what can you really expect."
15283,Black Squad is a really great multiplayer fps. The game modes keep you engaged for hours. And most importaintly it's not pay-to-win. Definately recommended.
15284,good games

15289,decent game
15290,Best Game Ever <3
15291,"I really like this so far. If you're searching for a good Black Ops 2 style shooting game, it's definitely a lot of fun. My main issue with it is that the maps don't seem big enough or dynamic enough at least in TDM. It's all mostly the same layout with not enough different map designs for most multiplayer modes. Another complaint I have is you only move fast with your knife out which isn't really so much of a complaint because I see the strategic value in it, just more of an annoyance when you have someone rush you and have to pull out your gun. brings out major CSGO vibes in that sense. but anyways it's a good game! worth the download! Only 5GB as of right now!"
15292,Dog shit fuckin game everyone screams tac reload or grenade. Fuck off.
15293,VeRy very GOOTO

15326,"THE BEST FPS GAME EVER ONE STEAM GOOD JOB, KEEP IT GOING!"
15327,Started out playing it for an occassional bit of fun. I'm going to have to say no to this one due to recent updates that make it no longer load. The BattleEye protection system is now blocking the game from running. It is blocking a well known npIKinemaWebAnimatePlugin.dll which is correctly up to date and not hacked. I have windows completely up to date and utilize Norton AV. I see no reason to go through a load of hassle to fix the broken software they installed when nothing is broken on my system :) So this one goes into the bin as just another attempt at a simple FPS time waster that has failed to continue to work. Lots of choices out there. This one is over.
15328,"Free FPS game. Black Squad is free to play game and mix between CS:Go and Combat Arms. 
This game is far from finished but it's fun to play...Devs need focus on anti-cheat tools."
15329,this game is a bullshit with teambalance..... the worst game i ever play so far......
15330,"Valve.... valve...... valve...... how could you allow a F2P game to steal your show, smh.

Pros:
- Counter Strike meets Free to Play lul
- No gun Advantages via steam payments
- Cool skins
- Lots of maps and modes
- Can get a knife for ingame currency wow!
- 1 tap heads
- No more Crouch spam!

Cons:
- May be hard to get into
- Flash blinds you while you're turned away from it and takes long to pop
- Ping issues but that's not too bad"
15337,"It would be nice everyone had access to all guns from start and not have to grind for it. 
Or like CSGO in match weapon buying would be nice too. 
Btw, it's fun. Although need improvements."

15345,"[b]tl;dr This is one of the rare moments a free-to-play lobby shooter has strictly conviences and asthetics being offered for premium currency, no weapons are locked behind a paywall and all can be earned with obtainable currency with 0% strings attached.  see my complaint below as why im downvoting it, it's too specefic to keep short.[/b]


Firstly, congratulations for making a buisness model that i have been starved for an incredibly long time, seriously, pat yourself on the back you did the unthinkable.

Now then, why am i against recommending this game you may ask?  did i get a few sour matches in that led to my disdain for the game? did an update occur that made me nope harder than the engineer from team fortress 2 could ever? did i not get that weapon i wanted after a long time?  if you thought i said yes to any of these, you just got pranked.

my issue stems from an update when they included a hidden MMR into casual play.  I was accepting until i realized what it had done, i was getting matched with several squads of people constantly, and I truely felt out of my leauge with how i was being paired up.  the sudden spike in difficulty was highly unwelcomed and led to me leaving.

reflecting upon it there's more to the complications than this is leading on.  While game-modes a plenty, the variety of weaponry, lacking.  as i metioned before and ill metion it again: [b][u]There is no Stat differences between premium weaponry and stock weaponry, only asthetical looks.[/u][/b] however, you now have a new challenge as a result.  for the time, the weapon variety was extremly shallow.  this may have improved over time but one can only make so many assault rifles untill it blends together.  with limited options for alternative point-man weapons like SMGs and Shotguns, one can really feel like the better choice is to enther pick up a DMR or an assault rifle.


I will praise it to be adding subtle details and other ninche appeals such as the +1 in the chamber, a pratice mode that allows spawning of static bot targets along with damage printout of where you struck, even a time trail for running a course designed by yourself.  the list goes on and on but there is one thing that does miff me, the incentive to do quick-play for the best possible rates and for post-game ""quests"" if you will.  I understand why it's there but sometimes when you want to hop into a game right then and there readily avalabie with room for you and your crew it's frustrating that doing so does not count for your ""quests"".

wrapping it up in a nice gift box with some passive agressive undertones and agitation I can put this game down and move on to something else.  if you want a free weapon with no gimmicks with a chance of a free alternative player mode or a pack of weapons to trail there are a handful of dlcs you can pop at your discretion.  player models as i observed and furiously cross compared them to the base model sport marginal differences but posess a similar size/shape overall.  the only notable differences is one of them has a big flippin hairdo that can be seen a mile away."

And by the way you can't choose between playing WITH or AGAINST your friends because friendship and clans systems are useless."
15381,This game is great and it is fun i loved but idk if it was only for me but the game wasnt runníng well it was crashing a lot tho and it was unplayable for me i  saw the game is 32bit and mine windows is 64 bit maybe its because of that

15384,good game
15385,"Honestly has the most satisfactory gun play In any game I've played since I don't know when, solid animations, solid feeling recoil and that crunch sound makes each kill feel unique.

TLDR one more round/late for work
Solid FPS that has entered my rotation.

Go to F2P game, I keep coming back to and have yet to get burnt out on. personal highlights below,
-No pay to win, only cosmetics and even those can be earned over time 
-Only played TDM for now but I enjoy this more than any AAA TDM games available
-Remember when FPS games bragged about their gun selections? This game Is what all those failed to deliver on, plenty of weapons to play around with
-Tactical Reload (round in chamber means one less round in magazine. hence the 29/30 ammo indicator)
-Runs smooth even on a potato 
-FREE, Iv'e spent more time with this game than 5 of the last AAA $60 games I picked up combined."

15391,"the game is pretty good, ping policy is not so good as with most online fps. technical framework is old, strong singlecore recommended. weapon balancing is good, private rooms are possible.  the game is not worse than any AAA fps i could think of and is f2p and no p2w.  theres issues that never get adressed though"
15392,Generic. Nothing to set this apart from any other CoD clone. Riddled with hackers as well. Don't waste your time on this.

15405,"Honestly I would like to give this game a decent review except for that it is the worst use of the Unreal Engine I've seen to date. Filled with cheaters, atleast one kicked everyone round, tons of suspect prefiring."
15406,Awesome fps for free love it
15407,"ive seen a suprising amount of players complaining about grenade spam. its not that bad anymore unless the metas changed from when i last played like 2 months ago ive started playing again from my memories of kicking the asses of campers and going 40 and 15 constantly trying to make that an average. i stopped playing because it was too easy back then no one knew how to play because everyone that did plays CS instead. its gotten harder after playing like no semi serious shooters for a few months although its still enjoyable the

in short its CS but free and with a more casual player base,"

The rifles are pretty luck based to a certain degree but amazing aim will out play that. It has solid gameplay and a community full of people waiting to play. For a free to play it will not get much better than this. Wonderful game."
15411,LOVE the game although after the windows update when the game launches all i get is audio and a white screen with no picture. Anyone have any suggestions???
15412,good

If you're looking for a free to play shooter, I highly recommend Black Squad."
15422,"Black Squad is a great game that blends Call of Duty and CS:GO together, you can get different skins, a wide range of weapons just like in cs:go aswell as alot more. The COD part of it would have to be how fast paced it is, you just can not slow down or camp for more than a minute. The graphics in this game are amazing, proof that alot of time and effort have gone into the designing of this game. Another great aspect about this game is how little is needed from your computer. While you do need 8 Gb of RAM, you only need 5 Gb of space which is a huge benefit. I really like this game because It is different and obviously becauase it's free, yes its free, which makes it a great game as you get alot for nothing."
15423,"Realistic graphics? OMEGALUL
No P2W? OMEGALUL
Servers? OMEGALUL"
15424,"I'll just be straight forward.
This game isn't great. Yeah, the guns look pretty and the trailer is meh.
I'm just gonna tell you not to even bother. The maps are very, very small. Even the biggest mode, which was the most fun, that holds 32 players is very tiny for such game play. On top of that, I only got to play twice due to the horrendous times in even finding a match. I'm talking several minutes for an 8v8 TDM... TEAM DEATH MATCH.....
Those are the bigger things, the smaller thing I could of lived with was the inability to sprint. But no having a reticle outside of aiming down a sniper scope bothered me. One last thing is the braindead gameplay. You literally could spray non-stop or hide behind a corner right outside their spawn, seeing how there is such a short time to kill, and gain a massive amount of kills...
Do yourself a favor a skip this FPS like I should have."
15425,Black squad or Grenade Squad :))))
15426,its like modern warfare very nice
15427,CS inspired gameplay with weapon mechanics that moreso resemble COD meshing together perfectly to make a super enjoyable game. I can't recommed this game enough it's fantastic. 10/10 i fuqs wit it

not as much fun as I thought it would be"

15442,Its free....  and awesome.... duh
15443,"Simple, mind numbing arcade shooter. It's like Call of Duty mulitplayer but waaay simpler.
The main menu was kind of confusing the first couple times I played because it's very messy and unorganized.
Player community is kinda garbage. 
Good for just listening to tunes and shooting at targets, not much else. I guess I would recommend for that. Plus it's free.
Overall Score: 5.7/10"
15444,Trash dont waste your disc space! from a buggy launcher to over powered weapons and terrible gunplay this is not a good fps. New guys are overpoiwed by experienced users with better weapons. its free for a reason.
15445,I don't know what to say about it because this game is alot of fun however it's not very good. I can't decide whether I like it or not because it has issues such as gun balancing and map design but it is fun to hop in for free with some friends and get some kills.
15446,Came back from more than a year break because it got buggy mess played couple customs to remember the gun play went to play some competitive 1st competitive and my game closed got penalty uninstalled it and removed it from my library ...
15447,thats great
15448,Very good game.
15449,VERY GOOD GAME!
15450,"[h1]This game is absolutely amazing! Better than a lot of paid games I've played! Great in-game ecomony, great and competitive gameplay and the customization is just done right! Not pay-to-win at all, it's play-to-win! Do recommend![/h1]

[h1] The game [/h1]
The game is very balanced and rewards progress, I enjoy the maps, the game and everything surrounding it feels very complete. There is only a small learning curve, and skill is definitely rewarded, but you are placed with people of similar skill, so not to worry! The mechanics feel great and it just feels like everything is done right.. There are some similar elements to other games, but not in a way such that it feels like a rip-off. In fact, the game has some very effective and creative solutions which I applaud them for. I have had a lot of fun, and some very intense moments in this first person shooter, and I continue to have fun with it almost every match! (and I consider myself pretty picky)
Definitely a game that I would recommend! Good for beginners as well as FPS veterans. Great value for money! (hehe, it's free!)


[h1] Performance [/h1]
The game is easy to run even though it looks very good. I tried it out with my old, slow laptop (i5 4300U, Intel HD graphics, which, comparing to desktop processors, is worse than the Pentium G3320 (basically the cheapest, slowest pentium processor from 2013..) And even still, on this laptop, it was very playable, with varying framerate. Between 40 and 60 fps, usually 50-60 fps, on minimal settings of course. 40fps was pretty uncommon and I've never seen it dip below 30fps during my brief testing. Potato PC approved ✓. On higher settings, it looks great, and it being able to run on lower-end devices is a great feature. And the faster pc's get a great looking game, too! (with ambient occlussion, shadows and whatnot)


[h1] Community [/h1] (as of 29/05/2018)
The community is alright, usually the chat isn't used actively, and a voice-chat system is lacking.  But there is a radio message system, comparable to CS:GO to kind of make up for it.. Weird thing is when you're spectating, no one, even your teammates (that are alive) can see it. This causes some of the silence I believe. I've made some in-game friends already, but what is lacking is a way to add them on steam, the in-game friends tab is a bit poor to use as it is. I would appreciate a button, like I've seen on some other games, to be redirected to a players' steam profile. As it stands now, I have to tell them my steam ID in the in-game chat or lobby. Yuck :/.

Funny thing; when you spawn, you're missing one bullet from your magazine. I'm not sure if this is intentional, but it's kind of this cool and unique thing of Black Squad to hear  evereyone's character shout 'Reloading!' in the beginning of a round.



[i](disclaimer, I'm pretty new and don't fully understand the whole 'conomy)[/i]
[h1]More about the economy
TLDR: You can earn all available weapons without paying a dime. You can unlock every one of them, money only buys you cosmetics. [/h1]
You earn in-game currency by finishing matches (discourages leaving prematurely), leveling up, signing in (every day) etc. etc. You can buy different knives with earned currency rather easily. There's some cool skins on the knives that are quite expensive (paid currency). You do get a chance at having them for free, buy a random box thing with in-game currency, that has the option to reward you a paid-currency knife! (Much like CS:GO boxes) for not a lot of in-game currency either! Along with skins and knives you can also buy character-skins, which changes your appearance in-game. Notably to a girl which a lot of players seem to do. This is also paid. Customization of classes (which weapons you want to use, etc.) seems a bit daunting at first and I got the hang of it rather quickly. 

I was able to buy myself a karambit knife pretty quickly and I'm loving it so far. There's a lot of weapoons to choose from for very little in-game currency (that you earn).

Basically, there's two free currencies; Gold and medals. With these you can buy weapons and accessories (grenades, etc). 
- Gold you gain easily for playing matches and often get rewarded these for signing in or whatever.There are 20 weapons you can buy with this. 19 primary weapons and 1 secondary weapon.
- Medals, you get these for leveling up and such. A bit rarer, you can buy 16 Primary weapons with this and 4 secondary weapons. With the medals you can also get 6 knives.
I think they've made the free aspect of this game great, you don't feel left out.

[Update: You can get one of the paid, or should I say 'premium' currencies for free! BS Coin it's called and with these you can buy skins! I have received 100 BS earlier and just now 500 BS coin, skins are priced either 500 BS coin or 20.000, so as a free player I am free to choose a skin of my liking, this is awesome! I have just bought some bullets as well, the paid-only currency you use to gamble for skins/BS coin using random boxes.]

[h1]My opinion on the bad feedback[/h1]
- Do I think the graphics are bad? No, not at all! I find myself admiring the scene sometimes, like I do in AAA games. (it's not perfect, but impressive either way and well-optimized!)
- Do I think the maps are small? No, not at all. 
- Is it pay-to-win? No, not at all. (I would like to hear the argumentation for this one)
- Servers bad? No not at all. I have pretty good ping on any game, sure. But I've never encountered network lag on this game, and I find matches very quickly (usually within 20 seconds, demolition). 
- You [b]can[/b] run in this game, you do it by holding the knife instead of the primary weapon (switch to it or press middle mouse button to automatically return to your primary when releasing it)
- I think there's plenty of customazation, what I really like is that there's no weapons that overpowered. I feel it's very balanced and you get to choose depending on your playstyle, not what's good and what's bad.

I see many people criticizing the game in a negative-only type of way. Many of these have barely played the game for an hour.. It's Early Acces, if you have a suggestion to make, tell the dev's. Don't hate on 'em for making a game that's finally good. I much dislike the direction that CoD and EA are taking. Pay full price for a game only to enter a world of DLC.
I've started disliking some of the elements in CS:GO. Having 1000+ hours played on it, I can assure you this game is not a CS:GO rip-off. Is it better than CS:GO? I can't tell you. But when I find myself bored, I hit up Black Squad, not CS:GO.

[u] The good feedback on this game is definitely deserved, I hope to play many more hours in this awesome game! Definitely try out demilition 5v5![/u]

[h1]In short; I love the game, and it's only 5GB in size, so what are you waiting for? :D[/h1]"
15451,"The graphics are alright, but the gameplay is really stiff. None of the weapons have any 'umph' to them. I guess if you're looking for a free-to-play CSGO this will scratch that itch.. but it's just not a good game at all. Nothing about it keeps you wanting to play. It's all very forgetful."
15452,im a prankster gangster
15453,"I Played This Game About 1500+ Hours. 
Once a Time, This Game Was So Good And I Was  Addicted To This Game!
I Created My First Own Gaming Community And Got Many Brothers And Friends By This Game!!
This Game Was Really Awesome!
Game Rating - 9/10
Graphics - 8/10

But After Getting Some S+H+I+T Updates, This Game Become Very Inactive And Dead.
Mainly Hackers Are Increasing In This Game! They Harassing Us Many Ways And They Waste The Fun Of This Game!
 So I Deleted This Game 3 Months Ago! 
But I Will Never Forget This Game!.

Thanks To 'NS Studio' For All :D :P

I Don't Think So...     That  I Will Again Return To This Game! :)"
15454,"Good game , active community. Devs listen to the community as well . Only reason I dont play much nowadays is due to hackers . The Anti Cheat system is flawed."
15455,"fun and amazing but would like if there were more variety in weapons
"
15456,"Saw the game have a market of skins at top of the Alphabet, got interested. Decided to give it a go. A reskin of Warface,with movements of Cod and some of CS, P2W like any other free to play FPS game made in Asia. People playing this game have ridiculous armors that can withstands like 10 shots,  a 7.62 ( from the Hk 417, thbe only gun available to purchase with the free currency) to the head should be an instant kill, but it's not apperantly.  Got in a 5v5 demolition match because TDM was SO bad with horrible map design, it was fun and I could get more kills when in 1v1 fights with the default gun against some guns with flowers on them. Came back to TDM to test my newly bought HK 417, only to realise that trading all the accuracy, fire rate, and recoil for a +10 damage. Still can't tap heads. Team got rekt from all directions, constantly got in to fights with flower guns and get crushed by 3 or 4 people at once. Uninstalled immidiately"
15457,ummm lovee this game. my general opinion pay to win but still fun. Download and see for your self.
15458,"good. feels like call of duty but the controls are better. didnt play it for long cuz i didnt know what game it was and lost interest after a while. good controls, good menus, levels are good unless the emeny overpowered. its a lot better than i thought it was going to be. only complaint is i found close quaters combat sloppy and the camera goes crazy. but long range fighting works just like in a triple a game. oh and it has a chat system, its a awkard chat system but theres plenty of options to choose from. if u played tf2, u know what chat system im referring. games fun. i like it more than call of duty but call of duty had really great game modes. if black had those modes with these controls, i would love this game. anyways, game is smooth most of time and is fun. i have small complaints here and there, mostly camera, but the game free, if i remember right, so its worth it. oh and it has a bot mode which is cool. couldnt get it to work but thats more than most games. wished more games had bot training. anyways pretty good. oh and grahics are good, not great, but it looks fine. i enjoyed it."
15459,AWSM GAME
15460,Good game :)
15461,really good graphs
15462,"The game is good the graphics are a good standard, there is much to recommend this game however the point this falls down is game balance, while there is a claim that the battles are balanced but it does hot appear to work very well, it has been done better.
This means that while I enjoy playing some of the games others battles leave you feeling like cannon fodder.  As a result I certainly would not pay for any of the items.
Play it, enjoy it but accept that some of the battles are very one sided."
15463,"Not a bad shooter.Recommend!
In a sense, even better than CS: GO
Are there scammers in the game? Yes. there are not so many of them.
Is it worth playing this game? Yes. but provided that if you have a good reaction and you are an attentive person.

Не плохой шутер. Рекомендую!

15464,Copy paste shooter replete with hacking.
15465,Very good for a free game! Good Job NS STUDIO!
15466,i strongly recommend you play this game its so damn fun
15467,"I can recommend this game for the following reasons.

1) Free to play (After a short while of playing, I decided to support the DEV's and pay for the founders edition)

2) Battleye Anti Cheat protection (Only in TDM)

3) Not pay to win (You pay for better weapons etc with gold and medals earned)

4) 200 max ping limit (This realy needs to be 120 max)

5) 10 Maps available in TDM, when you start TDM you never know what map you will be going into. Sometimes you will play the same map several times; just exit and wait 5 mins before rejoining a match.

6) Very fast pace of game. You need to be aware of where your team are to be affective, the mini map does help a little.

Annoyances

1) Players, mainly snipers blocking doors and routes that keep you safe-ish.

2) When you have too many high ping players, 150 to 200, on one or both teams it spoils the match. I am sure that as the game develops, there will be servers more dedicated to your region and max ping reduced.
Don't forget this is FREE TO PLAY and finances will be restricted to be able to give more and better servers."
15468,fun
15469,I have a play time for about 6 hours total I enjoyed it some what. I wish that there would be skill based people based on your skill level. uninstalled after total 6 hours just because of that reason kept being killed by high leveled people
15470,"Kinda garbage.  Guns felt too arcadey, the map I was slowly matched to had nothing but ground level firefights around containers meaning zero vertical aiming, and the game reeks of Korean grind and displays of wealth and not-gambling, as obvious from the mess of a main menu UI flashing me with who earned what from what loot boxes and how to acquire new things."
15471,"first game review.

I have played this game for abit less than a year and can say that it is my favorite game on steam.

pros:
1 the aiming is sharp.
2 there are many gamemodes to play like tdm, demolition, and assasination.
3 it gets a lot of updates and the devs seem to care about the players.
4 the starting guns are decent and there is a good variety of guns to choose from.
5 tamahawk shock
6 it will run on almost anything I have had it running on acer e15s with the right settings.
7  its a deal at $0 and when it says not pay to win it means it.
8 for a free game i have only ran into one guy that i was 100% sure was cheating.

cons:
1 the player bace isn't as big as it should be so some times you have to wait a few minutes to get a game.
2 becouse of how the server tick rate works laggy players get an advantage.
3 the tutorial sucks and any gamer who has played an fps game will only need the key bindings pert.
4 the ""power"" rating for guns means almost nothing.
5 I cant even think of more there are a few bugs but not any game breaking ones.
 

""Pro"" tips:
1 get the ""welcome fortune box"" and the ""free timed weapon packages"" from the dlc store they are a good way to start playing.
2 if you buy a sniper the ""blazer"" is the best of the gold ones and basicly the same as the medal ones.
3 get good at aiming for heads it is way better for your kdr.
4 if you try a new game mode play a few games as the maps take a bit of getting used to.
5 use headphones so you can hear directional sounds.

If you want to please cheakout my youtube channel where I post a new video every week. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz5Bt8SsafzALp-b5aeBODw/featured

15474,"This game is actually 10 time better than BattleField 1, Its super fun and if you do remember Wolfenstein Ennemy territory the skill you need is very similar.

10/10 Free game better than AAA title.

You will Love It!"
15475,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b]Unfortunately after investing a lot of time in this game I have to change my early access review to 'not recommended'...The game gets worse and worse instead of improving. Biggest problem is cheating...there is a growing infestation of hackers like in CS GO or even worse (aim bot, wall hack, lag hack, ddos just to name a few), the anti-cheat system is such a bad joke that sometimes prevents firefox (and possibly other browsers) to open instead of detecting and preventing actual hacks/third party programs. Other problems like unrealistic (low) damage and bad maps remain or getting worse...developers only interested in cash grabbing from lootboxes (you need more bullets bro) it seems.
Leaving my initial review intact below for comparison.[/b]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[h1]Militaristic tactical FPS - CS Go Clone[/h1]
Pretty descent CS GO clone with average graphics on Unreal Engine 3, quite popular and free to play.

[b]On the positive we have:[/b]
-Battleye anti-cheat system
-Dedicated geographical servers (EU, US etc), no big lag
-Good netcode and game mechanics, smooth experience
-Less Pay-to-Win than similar games with in-game store
-Free alternative to CS GO
-Fast-paced and somewhat realistic FPS
-Fun and entertaining without the 'need' to spend real money
-Many game modes all of which are fun (some more demanding than others)
-It's basically a skill-based game like CS GO

[b]On the negative we see:[/b] 
-Very average graphics on outdated Unreal Engine 3 (like the bulk of free shooters)
-Feels grindy and boring at first...takes a while to unlock many weapons and gear without spending real money
-It's 'pay-to-win' / 'time-to-win' up to a point like all f2p games
-There are hackers and cheaters but not as many as in other f2p games - Battleye not 100% effective
-Very good f2p game but not good enough to spend money on it yet
-Weapon balance could be better - the default weapons are better than some you will unlock later on
-Small and badly designed maps - this is a major issue for a tactical FPS and needs to be addressed
-No single player campaign
-You can attach silencer on LMGs but NOT on sniper rifles and pistols (besides one). WTF were the devs thinking??
-All national flag cards were recently removed from the game - many players (myself included) were enraged
-Needs better weapon balance and more realism overall

In other words, Black Squad is not bad at all, in fact it is one of the best free-to-play shooters out there.
However it needs many improvements and since it is still Early Access it has room for such improvements and a lot of potential...as long as they don't screw things up.
Barely recommended but avoid spending money on this for the time being."
15476,good arcade
15477,"game lacks actual matchmaking, i often experience meeting a 5-man stack with rank 70ish people while my entire team is rank 1-10. absolute slaughter. also, the game doesnt really punish leavers so most matches are full of turkish people leaving every game.  also, grenades one shots people, please nerf. 

tl;dr  no matchmaking system, no punishment for leaving, grenades op."
15478,I love this game very much but the main problem i have is the game randomly crashing

15480,"that's very nice game , i used to play it with my friends and we got more much fun"
15481,"This game is complete shit. The hit boxes are terribly rendered, every game I miss shots that shouldn't miss, and thats not because im bad. Everything costs money, its just another money grab. Almost everything you get from cases are 1-15 day trials for skins and weapons. The map balancing is so terible to the extent that a coplete noob can win against decent players because of the map, trust me, I know, i have won games against sweats just because of the side of the map I spawned. This game is complete trash and a waste of time.

Game description says: ""Battleye support, dedicated servers, great shooting mechanics and amazing netcode. Black Squad is a military first-person-shooter game using the Unreal Engine 3 to show realistic graphics and dynamic visuals. Absolutely no Pay-to-Win. Welcome to the best F2P shooter on the market.""

Shooting mechanics are terrible, use scopes reduces all recoil. I dont know wtf battleye is so why tf say it. Realistic graphics doesnt mean shit if the game is terrible, take world of tanks for example. It is completely pay to win because it takes for ever to grind for the credits you need to get better weapons. And it is really not the best f2p shooter, its dog shit."
15482,good game
15483,this game is so good
15484,i do like this game
15485,"Good game, but lacks comunnity service and creates a  small comunity section where only few normal people play this game. I do recomend to play this game, because its fun and dosent disapoint you, but not allways!"

15492,Fun Game. Toxic Community.
15493,"i like this game and the fact that it have a ton of weapons to choose from is nice since iam playing from oceania region it pretty laggy sometime to play at NA or SEA
would be nice if there an australian sever or something like that"
15494,+++
15495,"Amazing game
Gameplay - very small maps that make the game very tense and interesting, very good shooting mechanics and i am surprised this game is free to play as its so good

[9.2/10]

Graphics - very good graphics esspecialy for a free game with good optimazation

[8.4/10]

Sound - very good sounds that match the game perfectly

[9.7/10]

To sum up, this game is deffinently a game you need to try and even if it wasnt free i would buy it

Overall - [9.1/10]"
15496,"They only doing new crate and weapon skin thats it, nothing special."
15497,"Bad game, always got black screen and I had to tab out then back in. I would love if they actually got a lot of the common bugs fixed asap."
15498,"Good game , easy to learn gameplay but it may take time if you want to mastered your weapons ."
15499,"Free To Play, Addictive and most importantly, NOT pay to win."

Not rampant with hackers, dont have to wait for ever to get into a game, heaps of weapons, balanced game play and its FREE!!!!! Im in Australia and jump on the south east aisia server and the game play is fine even though it says 300+ ping? some sort of glitch? dont know but try it yourself. I really rate this game."
15505,best FPS game ever!
15506,"the game is honestly really good the only thing i would change is the map size 
"
15507,yes very good for fdree game
15508,"The game is good and must of all fun, but it like keeping stats of you winnings and killings, so then you enter a map were the enemy is 1 point from winning and you can see that there is no chance in hell to win - you will have the stats look like you just lost - and this can happen many times.."
15509,"game is honestly really bad + dead

Wait for Ironsight to release on steam or go download it on their launcher, its a lot better than this"
15510,"i love 69
"
15511,its a fun game great time.killer
15512,"I hope this review is helpful to the dev's and fellow gamers.
Black Squad is a fun, free, FPS that has a lot of potential.
I like that it's fast paced. I like how well done the combat is, I feel as though I have an equal chance in a firefight as the enemy. The mechanics of the game are overall good but I do not like how you can only rent grenades for a certain amount of time. I think the game would benefit if weapon attachments were implemented so you could choose different things and unlock them, instead of them being already equiped. The main appeal of this game is that it is free, so keep it that way."
15513,Give me back the canadian flag Card. i paid for it so i want it back. Why would you take the flags off idiots.
15514,Cant go a few seconds without dying. seems like all f2p games are bad these days. get csgo not this please it will make you a tryhard player
15515,I tried to play this game and I feel that it is horrible. My reasoning is that the controls are really bad since they are trying to fit so much in and my least favorite placement is sprint which is on the mouse wheel and you have to click and hold it. also the menu is large and confusing. I was also mislead and when I saw the pictures for it on its download screen I was mislead and thought it was going to be like CSGO. I think that you should play a game like Warface instead.
15516,"Good f2p Fps
"
15517,"This is a fun game and seems fairly balanced. Love the play-to-win model. You play to earn credits which unlock new guns, equipment, etc. Starting guns are fairly decent so there is not a huge disadvantage for new players.

The mechanics are decent but I'd like to be able to run/jog by holding shift - currently you hold shift to walk which seems backwards to me. I'd also like to be able to lean around corners instead of having to step out from behind cover to take a shot. These are just small personal preferences, though. Overall gameplay feels good.

My major gripe is the menu UI. The UI is not very organized or intuitive and it takes a while to figure out where everything is. There is alot going on and it's hard to find the buttons you need. As a designer I would suggest keeping it simple and get rid of the extra clutter, or at least organize the buttons in a central location.

Overall, it's a good game that I see myself playing for a while. I'd recommend it."
15518,"Great F2P without P2W elements all real money items are purely cosmetic. 
I just wish that there were more gamemodes or some kind of zombies mode. 
Can get repetive because of that .  Otherwise this is great !
"
15519,good game
15520,tooo much server issue. disconnected from the server quiet often. otherwise this is a game to spend some time
15521,good
15522,Nice game...intense
15523,Good improving game
15524,Goood Game
15525,"This game has one of the worst menus and customization interfaces I've ever experienced.  This game has about 3-4 different types of currencies for different unlocks in an attempt to mask the push to having you purchase loot crates.  Most of the free loot boxes give you a 1-2 day weapon, almost always being the same with a very rare chance to receive anything better.  Get used to buying gernades every day and equiping them as well if you're new.


The game has terrible matchmaking where you'll play with all random maps, but play the same map sometimes 3-4 times in a row.  The menu in this game is an absolute cluster of filth which will challenge you (and probably make you web search) how to even invite players in a game (you have to be in a very specific menu which it doesn't indicate).

That being said, the gunplay is pretty fun, the weird sensitivity setting setup kinda works, and the game can be pretty fun to shoot for being a free to play competetive style shooter.  I'm recommending it because it's free and the Anti-cheat seems to work well enough.  I don't find that I run into blatant cheaters often which is something present in CSGO, Battlefield 4, PUBG, and a lot of other games that cost money.  That, and it's only about 8 gigs, which is a big plus.

I like it better than Ironsight, and it doesn't take much to get into the game.  Once you learn the terrible menu and customizations and get a gun or two you like, you'll probably enjoy playing it now and again when you want to get a few frags.  Also, if you've read this far, if you're new and go into the DLC, there are plenty of free packs to choose and test out new weapons before you spend your hard RNG'd currnecy on a gun you're not familiar with."

Whoever made such a bad tutorial that has to use text to explain everything, stop you so you take a rocket and learn how to use a medikit and stop you at other times as well interrupting what little gameplay flow the tutorial had....
well that guy needs to d a better job
It is basic gamedesign to make the player learn by themselves!
Anyways i read the describtion of it beeing a realistic shooter aaaand... it's a cod like shoot em up arcade shooter
I was expecting ATLEAST a rainbow six(not siege ya dingos, VEGAS BABAY) or with luck a swat or ready or not
But it's just another cod clone
If you like that thats fine but i just gotta say
FALSE ADVERTISING"

15553,"Love the game. Wish there was a few more weapons. Also when you shoot someone in the head, the sound effect that you get is so annoying. And no matter how much i turn it down it's still there. It sounds like someone bashed their skull into a goddamn wall. There is grinding in this game. Just letting everyone know."
15554,"[b][u]24 May 2018 (Negative Review) [/u][/b]
This game is Good but gets boring really quick.Unlike CSGO its not very Addictive. Clan Matches are not good concept
.
[b][u]5 Sep 2018 (Positive Review) [/u][/b]
Developer is commited to game and can make this game a Phenomenon if they want.
Recently they introduced [b]Competative[/b] match making which is good direction they are going."
15555,"Considering that Black Squad is Free to Play, it's hard to give it criticism--because it is genuinely enjoyable. I think it is graphically impressive. Shooting mechanics are satisfying and for the most part the sound design has been accurate. The main menu UI is a bit ugly, but that is something they may fix. I recommend giving it a try!"
15556,"Love this game, if you're into a chill FPS and are like me and generally suck at video games then this one's great. The community is made of awesome people too. 

Only a few problems:
- Super laggy servers on occasion with stupid high ping
- Limited maps and only a few different game modes
- Most weapons cost more than they should

Always room for improvement but all in all a fun time."
15557,"Very awesome free multiplayer shooter. The graphics are pleanty alright. Good maps, mostly have a modern theme, not sandy war zones. The feel of it is great, any 'cheap' tricks seemed to be dealt with, I haven't noticed any imbalances or anything like that. Many weapons to chose from, I don't see a huge advantage in the premium guns. What a love on this aspect is you can chose less standard weapons, like an axe instead of a knife. Not hard to get the mony's but not so easy that it doesn't feel like a reward. I like this game alot, i'm sure if I dropped 50-60$ on a game with better graphics I may like that more, but I've played alot of premium shooters that didn't feel right to me."

15565,Really Its A very Nice Game....
15566,new maps pls. then improve quick match making.tnx!
15567,"The novelty wears off rather quickly.

There are several gamemodes I'd rate like this:

-> Customgame -> Melee Only
By far the best gamemode, as long everyone respects the honor code

-> Team Death Match
The good part is that it is chaotic and you can ignore snipers if you know what parts of the map to use and not use.
You can always have a fun game no matter if you win or lose

-> Demotlion
Is a CS clone, but a bad one.
Technically the Counterterrorists would be at an advantage if you played strategically, but no one does,everyone just runs straight at eachother and dies.
Your success is kinda reliant on whose sniper gets the random headshot and gives their team a number advantage.
Most maps have a single best strategy, so they become boring rather fast.

-> Assasination
It is a weird mode, didnt grow on me

-> That one mode you wait forever in queue for
I dont remember its name, but you need 32 players for it. Have fun waiting for 32 players.


It is a free game and really not pay to win, even though the relevant currency is hard to grind and it is defititely enough fun to not be a waste of time, but it kinda gets stale after a while, idk"
15568,good game but there are hardly and servers near australia and you keep getting kicked from games for high pin.
15569,i LOVE IT
15570,"if you want to play csgo or cod for free this is a game for you, but have fun getting used to being spawned camped seeing the maps are pretty much all the same thing small and lazy experencing games like siege make you realise small maps can be fun and differnet, but anyway cant recommend this game its just not good."
15571,Terrible game atm. Hit reg is unbelievable. Maps are small and lazily made.  DO NOT PLAY

15579,"Got 320 hours played, 30.000 kills and 2.8k/d, It was fun in the first few months, to bad no real competitive game scene came to life, thus I quit. 

Tried to come back and play twice, both times there were hackers within the first few games that instantly kill anyone in the room: yet another Free to play FPS that is ruined and neglected. Therefore not recommended."
15580,"this   game 
(awesome)


u can play this game with ure manny friends who love playing fps game
with the help of some mic team is good"
15581,You might as well play Call Of Duty.
15582," Well, after some time playing this game I can say that I enjoyed it most of the time.
 Don't expect sometnig new from it, we've seen everything it has to offer 100 times before. TDM maps are mostly small, and designed for fast and agressive CQB, even if all of them have some kind of a sniper-designated area. Demolition/Assasination/Battle modes maps are a little bigger and will give you some breathing space. Not too much though. The real problem of the game, is the lack of a new content. I mean it's in development, so it has to get new stuff regulary, right? I was playing it for a year or so, and all new stuff i've seen was 1(one) new map and a sh**load of skins for guns/grenades/melee weapons. I'm an occasional player, meaning i can play 1 or 2 matches a day, sometimes not playing for couple of days at all, so i'm not too bored yet. But if you going to play it more often keep that in mind.
 Still, the game is well balanced and polished, it's fun to play. I'm an aggressive Submachinegun-runner type of a guy, so it'suits me well. Also a good thing is they don't lie about pay-to-win, real money won't give you any kind of advantage, ALL of the guns available for Bullets(real time money) can be bought for ingame currency that is earned really fast.
 So, in my opinion it's worth a try, it's free after all."
15583,gud game with gud graphics and many attractive guns and enjoyable
15584,TDM is fun but it has too less game mods and at one point you will get bored to do the same thing with the same weapons (not that its hard to get weapons but they feel very similar). Events are also nice.
15585,Is there any sprint option?

15607,roblox phantom forces has better gunplay than this game
15608,"Review:
A fantastic and fun game play experience.
Cool guns, easy to use, run and gun rewarded.
Skill Gap if you are quick and experienced in shooters.
A lot like counter strike in the sense of movement.
Definately recommend this game to actually start playing as a main game for certain people.
It's fun, play it!"
15609,"Fun game, good shooting mechanics and great netcode. That said, negative review because they do not have west coast servers for us in NA. From what I've read it looks like they have them set up as far east as possible, and because of this I get very high ping with nothing I can do about it. If you're only going to have one server location, why would you not locate that in the middle of the country where everyone gets an average ping instead of isolating the entire other coast. Until that gets changed I can't recommend the game and won't spend any more money on it."
15610,I like everything in this game but I want to change my name would please add something so players who want to change name can change it?
15611,good for sniping
15612,"Black Squad is a free to play multiplayer only FPS game.

The Good:
+Decent presentation as far as graphics, music, and sound effects are concerned.
+Fast arcade gameplay.

The Bad:
-Grinding.
-Grenade spam.
-Nothing to set the gameplay apart from other shooters.

Bottom Line:
I can only recommend Black Squad if you absolutely cannot afford CS, Siege, or any of the other better premium FPS games out there."
15613,"Another one that makes me wish steam had a ""meh"" option for reviews. It's alright. A more cartoon-y bog standard multiplayer FPS with a few cool ideas, and a bit more chaotic than most. Time to kill is significantly higher than similar titles. Guns are generic and pretty much standard, except sniper rifle builds are currently quite OP, making long range maps a bit of a nightmare at times. UI design is atrocious, I've never had to use a UI with such a steep learning curve before. A few more modes would be nice, but then it is early access. I might revisit it when it comes out fully, but for now I've had enough. Worth a try if you want a new multiplayer FPS though, after all, it's free.

Edit:  Forgot to mention it's buggy as hell. Not in gameplay terms necessarily, but it boots to a white screen until I tab in and out a few times. In fact, it has a lot of problems with tabbing out in general. Quite why it's a 32-bit game with DX9 in 2018 I couldn't say. Lots of other reviews say there's loads of cheaters, but I haven't encountered any in the short time I played (on the Europe server)."

the game is OK, it feels cheap or cheesy and has a few glitches that are easy to notice. there are glitches in the first person. and the animations cut apon each other. however.... the graphics are nice but the game is clearly trying to copy CS:GO.
to much microtransactions and ingame payments.

15651,"Went into this game expecting to uninstall it after playing it once but have to say it has me slightly hooked. Definitely has the CS feel to it. Small maps, nice gun play although I've not used many of them yet but satisfying to use. Gun sounds are good and it sounds brutal when you kill another player.

There are cheater/hackers though which not only ruin this game but many others too.

Game definitely has potential."

15655,Worked good and fun game until it started recently everytime i start game whte screen only this game not sure why both other than that the time i had spent with this game was great only other downside besides white screen was loading times to find a match.
15656,"I had to change my recommendation from positive to negative, This game was good in 2017, Devs lack communication with the community, They keep squeezing skins every update and cases, They don't fix bugs or even add content. The game's player base is dropping so fast it went from 8k to 3k and still dropping. Devs aren't doing anything to help fix the game instead they squeeze every single drop of money they can before this game dies. CSGO is now F2P. AVA Dog Tag OBT is coming. Devs are only competing with more skins. Hope this game dies soon was good when it lasted. :)"
15657,I didn't recommend it at first because of it crashing quite often but after the last update it's working remarakbly well and I think it's a great game to play
15658,i like
15659,"good game
"
15660,"dis is a good game ye bye
"
15661,"In my 1.4 time of play i encountered at least 5 hackers,sooooo that's a no no for this game.
"
15662,Nice game
15663,Why would you play this
15664,"after 5 min the server will stop, i could see who killed who in the top right , but players will stop working , it is like i lose my connection , at this time i have to get out of this room and get back again , and if i have any kill our something i'll lose :(
BS gonna worse with Cocktail servers..."
15665,This is a quick and fun team vs team shooter. You only stay dead for a few seconds before you're blowing bullets again. Good players and generrally good gameplay. It can get old after a while but its a fun casual shooter compared to the more competitive titles like Counter-Strike and Overwatch.
15666,"Honestly pretty fun, It's not really paytowin as far as I've seen, and the only downside is how the game does have a rental system (It's pretty lenient compared to other games with this system, as you can very easily buy the guns themselves permanently without paying actual money, it's mainly grenades and skins to worry about) I would honestly pay money to play the game if the rental system was removed, because it has pretty good quality, it's fun, and the skins actually add cool effects to reloads, bullet trails, and other things. Like cherry art leaving cherry blossoms in the air when reloading or firing the gun the skin is on, etc. I've had fun with this so far and with how interesting and cool the skins are, I'm actually tempted to spend some money on this."
15667,"played for 2 hour and every single lobby had atleast a hacker or 2.

Not wurf."
15668,Its almost like CS but this game Sucks more then CS.
15669,gud
15670,wow for a free and multiplayer game . i can just say THE BEST adrenalin maker
15671,SHIET
15672,.
15673,"-great graphics
-good shooting mechanics
-worst maps in a history of games
-many hackers
-there isn't so big choice in weapons 
but it's on early access"
15674,"Since my post on the discussions page was deleted, I'll update my review.

This game is full of cheaters. ESP, aimbots, no recoil, are all rampant. Linked below is a video example of how blatant the cheating in this game is, with the developers doing absolutely nothing to stop it. They simply pretend it doesn't exist, locking or deleting any topic that points out the fact that it does, in fact, exist in full force.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfmnJzojseE"
15675,Good
15676,full of cheaters
15677,this game is terrible the grenades are busted the guns do no damage
15678,Its just a copy of csgo but they tried to make it unique. The mix of everything just makes the game fucking wack.
15679,After 1700+ hours on this game im done the game is full of cheaters not fun i wasted 500$ on this game i really liked it but is hard for me to say that the game is dead
15680,"So I downloaded this game since I was scrolling in the free to play category and I saw this game it look good so i downloaded, i played the first tutorial and while i was getting my first awards my monitor goes black for a second I thought my hdmi was messed up but I wasnt it was the game like how is this early access and the game made my monitor go back constantly when I wasnt doing anything it gets even worse I restarted my pc and no audio like thanks a lot Black Squad you broke my pc with your black screen, it's not bad game but the condition that I went through and I didnt got a chance to play my first pvp match I'm giving this broken damn game like a 4.5/10 see I would reccomend this game but for breaking my audio and I cant hear anything that's just draw the line"
15681,jolly good show
15682,I have no clue how to log out and i don't like this game that much.
15683,"Horrible game, the very worst of all F2P shooters. The recoil is ridiculous and the gun damage non existent. Either you invest some money and get a good weapon which you than have to master, or leave this game be. You can be broke, but you can never be so broke that you cant afford CS:GO or Overwatch for that matter. Even Paladins is better."
15684,is good
15685,after you throw a grenade instead of automatically return to your main weapon they give your other grenade.
15686,"Is it Pay-to-Win?
There is a currency called ""Bullets"", which you can ONLY get with real world money. 
With this you can buy skins, but also boosts that effectively give you 50% more ingame money whenever you get any. You get normal ingame money after rounds and for completing challenges and so on. You can buy weapons, items and grenades with this ingame currency. 
With real world currency you can buy boosts to get more ingame currency, you can buy boxes that have a high chance of giving you a good amount of ingame currency.

Weapons and Items you buy have a huge impact on how you perform in game. You can not directly buy most of these items with real world money, but if you just spend a few dollars you can indirectly get huge amounts of ingame money.


TL;DR: You can pay real money to indirectly get ingame money. You get ingame money from playing matches. This means that you can use real world money to give yourself a noticable advantage.


I recommend this game because, despite the above, the gameplay is smooth, responsive, the gamemodes are kind of unique in the way they actually feel. The maps need some work, but they are very well balanced whenever the teams are balanced as well. It's one of the better FPS games out there.

But ffs, take the whole ""this is not pay to win"" stuff out of the game description."
15687,I LOVE THIS GAME..JUST NO ONE ON TO PLAY...
15688,cheaters are runing this game
15689,"Good, better than csgo! :)"
15690,best free to play fps multiplayer game in steam :)
15691,Knockoff counterstrike. Most satisfying one deag i've ever hit.
15692,"So far,excellent pacing, sweet grafics, animations and fun as hell game. Only down sight is that some maps are too short, and not many guns currently in game. More sidearms,more shotguns, a few more SMGS and snipers would be pretty nice. Also some more game modes would be neat as well. This game is fairly new though so it is expected to be missing some stuff. Overall great game, good work!"
15693,This Game is bad
15694,NOPE. JUST NOPE.
15695,"[b]Description[/b]
It is like putting CS:GO, RS6:Siege, and CS:Nexon in a blender. You get good graphics, deathmatch styled TDM, Defusing bombs, large scale ""Base Destruction"" type things, where you pick one of four classes, and save up points to buy abilities, such as sentries, air support, XM25's, etc. It's gunplay is a nice mix between realism and arcade, making it very addicting. The inventory and loadouts are very smooth to use, and shock me how great and simple it is. I think it is a F2P worth checking out.

[b]Warnings and Advice:[/b]
This game uses one of those inventory systems where you unlock crates for doing, ""side mission"" type stuff. The crates are free to open, and are RNG. I know that just scared some of the off, but the crates make up for it, here is why: Some items, such as most skinned weapons, and character cards (basically a Callsign in COD, purely cosmetic) are temporary. They range from lasting one day, to a month. But everything that actually matters, and will actually win your war, is permanent, making it worry free. So like I said, why does this make the crates work? 99% of the stuff crates drop is permanent, unlike some bought stuff, making it a really good roll of the dice.

[h1] TLDR: Check it out! [/h1]"
15696,"This game has the worst servers I have ever played on. I played on asia servers on fornite and it's better then this bullshit, I am not happy with this result and will kill myself in the process. k bye"
15697,BEST GAME YAEESSS
15698,"It's honestly a great game, just play it, it's such a small download anyways. Well worth it"
15699,"Ok i cant reccomend this because there are certain items you cant even even buy permanantly, but not only that but the map layouts are shit. The other team can camp right where everyone spawns, and its BS. ALso there is no regen. I cant figure out the mechanics of this game. The tutorial is much different from the actual gameplay. Just spend the money on something better."
15700,Pay to win post Valofe
15701,nice
15702,"lol I bought a crate that clearly says it gives you a PERMANENT item for 30k gold and got a 3 DAY smoke grenade...and an achievement for ""first step for empty wallet""...
After a misleading error like this I hardly think ill waste any money on this."
15703,Its so cool and its perfect game thanks for all
15704,"best game iam addicted 2 him but try reconnecting instead of disconnected from srver
"
15705,Poor man's CS:GO???

15708,Great and fun game to ply
15709,"Negative:
-Pay 2 win weapon system.

Positive:
-Good looking and good optimized.

I know game is free so it need some system but this way it will be same as zula..."
15710,it is my fav game for 500h
15711,"The Game is fun but you need to make bigger maps, 8v8 is really hard  for a map that is 1/16 the size of a cs map."
15712,im a fu**ing water bottle what do you expect from me nibba
15713,este un joc foarte asemanator cu cs:go sau cs 1.6 dar este mult mai distractiv
15714,The best Free to Play Game.
15715,is gud
15716,"My own opinion is that this game has so many options or doors that are opened for the devs, its cool, but dont let it die"
15717,just hackers and bugs dont play this game it will die very soon
15718,"This the second best Free to play FPS for all .
CS:GO still the number 1"
15719,Very nice FPS game. One of the best FPS I've ever seen

15721,"F2P, Not P2Win"
15722,"This games still needs lot of improvement, its good that its half a day on server maintance but sometime its to much I barely have time to play the game but whenever I open the game its up on server maintance . Well its realy good you are updating the game the whole company is working on it and there are not even hackers in this game . 

I hope the future updates wil be awesome and the charecter and guns price be lowered . I loved this game and thanks for making this game . 




( I will probably rate this game 8 out of 10 ) . 
<AWSOME>"
15723,"You guys need a new mode like for example Infected Mode for zombies vs soldiers
please"
15724,Fun to play!
15725,This game is for lybian slaves
15726,Good game
15727,"fantastic game, thanks!"
15728,"https://chng.it/FSjtHH44rn

Go to that link to get black squad removed from steam forever or force them to fix the issues they have with the game. They refuse to ban people that are obviously hacking but they added a messaged when someone is kicked from lagging out of the game or the game crashes it says they was banned by battleye. This is a lie no one is banned. When trying to speak up about this on going issue they will ban you from the forums completely. They do not wish to change stop the raciest people from winning and the hackers. ban them or shut your game down"

15730,"Great overall FPS, straight forward, easy to get used to, what can I say? Amazing work. NO PAY TO WIN.
This game makes me rememeber of the old days of CROSSFIRE when it was so much fun."
15731,"The game can be fast and furious.  There are only 6 maps on the TDM area and these would be better if they were slightly larger.  All in ll  good, fast and entertaining game."
15732,"Dont even try, the devs are useless, spineless trolls.  I wish Valve would have stronger rules for getting games removed off Steam for devs acting like them.

Cheating is the norm and game basics (Spawn is a protected space) is lacking.  You just setup a sentry gun in enemy spawn and collect point and gold and an EZ win.  No skill tons of kill.

Item exploits are everywhere, in fact one of the hacks is endless sonar wallz.

PPL do 20 headdshots in a row all over the map (clear hack) and the devs contest that they are hacking."
15733,it is an amazing game... surprisingly F2P!
15734,"Okay so, my first review. Overall I liked the game. It's something between CS and COD, meaning it has that nice fast pace, with decent graphics. Only thing that I found anoying is the small glitch that I always get before I get killed. Sometimes it's a bit before that, and it makes me wonder could I have won the duel if it weren't for that. Also, net speed is great, and ping is in the 40 range, so it's on them.
If you are decent at this game, and it's not that hard to get there, there won't be need to make any purchases within the game, cause with a bit of time every weapon can be bought. Having said that, not those with the custom look."

15737,To many hackers
15738,"Don't bother. Far too many cheater. You'll end up in matches with the same 2-3 people that are using wall hacks and aim bots, over and over again, because they are practicaly the only people that play this game anymore."
15739,Awful. Full of cheating russians and noobs who constantly throw grenades across the map. DON'T BOTHER GETTING IT UNLESS YOU LIKE GETTING KILLED EVERY TIME YOU SPAWN!
15740,"nice gameplay, nice graphics, hakers? for me i havent encountered one so the odds of encountering one is pretty rare, plus this game is free"
15741,best game like csgo
15742,wow...all good...i love this game......
15743,Awesome game
15744,why do i have over 100 ping to the us server
15745,Unplayable
15746,👍
15747,dull
15748,"Do you like tiny maps, campers, nade spam, bizarre hit boxes and awful sound? Then get this game."
15749,I Love The Game
15750,omg best free game ever i bought many in game stuff for $200
15751,"Overall Evaluation: Piece of crap game with a lot of potential.

Pros:
1. Excelent graphics.
2. Easy to learn.
3. Not Pay-to-win.
4. They do have Designated Marksman rifles.

Cons:
1. Terrible movment mechanics. (i.e. no prone, no leaning around corners, no sprint.)
2. Camper friendly maps.
3. Temporary Grenades (It makes you buy frags at least every week.)
4. All guns are practically the same. (All snipers are one shot one kill, all SMGs shoot superfast, DMR is just an assualt rifle with a scope, etc.)
5. Minimal Weapon Customization. (All guns are equipped with a scope that can not be removed or changed.)"
15752,"This game is one of the best free to play games on steam and right fully so. It's premises is game modes you'd find in csgo or cod my favorite is death match between 2 teams of 8. The game is really fun and easy to get good pretty quickly. There is in game currency but 1 to 3 dollars got me a new character krambit and a couple guns and everyday you get a free loot box to open to find more currency or even a certain weapon or gernade for usually a day. Good graphics no major gameplay issues sometimes takes a few minutes to find a match
Overall it's free good way to pass time and listen to music"
15753,Really good game. My only suggestion is to make the maps a bit bigger for TDM.
15754,"Ok listen up!!! I have played many free fps eg.Line of sight,Blacklight retribution,Zula,etc...but THIS game is what u r looking for in f2p fps no questions asked."
15755,yohooooo
15756,Good game
15757,sucks dick (bbc)
15758,It better than other F2P game.
15759,It's like CSGO but horrible.
15760,its good so i give a recommend
15761,"played csgo my entire life

ive never been prefired or insta hs as much in any other game for the past 17 years than this one.

make your own decision"
15762,"pretty much decent FPS game, i loved it
"
15763,"Okay Ill be honest I wanted to bash this game about how its pay2win and all when i was downloading it but when I played it, It didnt feel like a p2w game at all. Its a simple first person shooter with a more arcadey feel and thats it. You can get weapon skins for a limited time by getting them in drops from crates which seems good enough for me. Bear in mind i have only 4 hours in the game as Im writing this and I am excluding things such as bad hit reg or  cheaters because its a free game with a competitive edge, its expected to have a few people using hacks to get to a higher skill level but this didn't affect the amount of fun I had without spending a dime."
15764,How can I play this game if everytime that I try to adjust my mouse sensitivity it crashes my computer.
15765,super fun to play with friend  and also this game are f2p no need to whale except you really want nice skin
15766,"Too many Pro :(
But still a nice game

I kinda love the Ak-12 and the MDR"
15767,"It's a very good game you can play hrs and hrs if you have a good team or clan.
The graphic is not bad the hitbox is very good in my opinion and every gun is balanced kinda :))
I recomand this game for those peoples who don't have a really good PC but they want to play a good FPS game whit his friend's 
Ohh and btw those peoples who are talking bad things about the game just think a little
The game is F2P and it have bugs or strange things 
The grenade is not OP just think a little IRL if a grenade explodes behind or in front of a man he will probably die (IRL the grenade has range like in the game) :)))
Ohhh and a funny thing, in this game the Anti Cheat is better then in Csgo :DDDD 
So again i recomand this game for everyone. ;))"
15768,"NOT a pay to wim game which is grate 
fun free game
what more can you ask for"
15769,Awesome game easy to play
15770, lackluster in terms of customization and a small map would recommend if you want a free game but remember you get what you pay for
15771,Great Game So far So Good i like it
15772,yeet
15773,"To give you a short indicator of the quality we're talking here:

It crashes everytime you alt-tab,"
15774,"-Tiny maps
-Every weapons has a grenade launcher, combined with tiny maps it sucks too many explosions and random death.
-You cant run with weapon and it not on SHIFT it on middle mouse button and it equip knife
-No balance i has level 2 and i get with level 30+ 
"
15775,good
15776,"Well, that's what happens when you take CrossFire and add to it a little bit of Call of Duty mechanix, and that's a damn great work!"
15777,"This Game is full with Hackers. The Team Balance is Trash. You must play against a Team of Highranked Players with Sh't Teammates. It doesn't even exist a Reportfeature. I hope, the Usersupport will get better. The Maps are also the biggest piece of Shit ever. I know, it's early Access, but there are far to many Hackers. I'm Sry, but i don't like the Game anymore."
15778,add armor ............
15779,Best Free to Play FPS game!!!!
15780,"This game is great with just one flow, which happens to be one that will make you rage and/or quit. Assuming you want to play some casual 5v5 or 8v8 demolition, you will at times experience the horrendous matchmaking from the developers of this game. There have been multiple instances where you will get matched up with a 5 man clan with max rank and extensive experience in the game while you are teamed up with rank 1 starters."
15781,It's good game!
15782,OP game
15783,The play button in the launcher doesn't work
15784,m
15785,Shitty maps with shitty guns. Waste of time
15786,The best game I liked a lot and thank you
15787,"Basically a CoD clone. It's pretty your usualy arcade FPS, the grenade spam is horrible, they even got some of the descriptions bad.
Soviet Union in 2009? Lol"
15788,"This will be my first negative review I've ever had to write.

This game is just plain boring. It's borderline unoriginal. Sure, the Practice system is semi-unique. But it isn't much compared to the unoriginal, far too common gameplay style similar to many first person shooters. I personally believe this is a waste of time. Sorry guys."
15789,CSGO with $10 knives...
15790,Very good game. Imo better than CS:GO.
15791,Best Game for Player with nack for Quick Shooter Action.
15792,Not a bad game but definatly could use time and effort.
15793,dev just like add new skin
15794,"It was 2017 when I downloaded this game. It caught my eye because it seemed not so mainstream as let's say Warface and it was and still remains absolutely free.

Back then I was surprised with graphics and game concept (as many say, it is a hybrid of CS and CoD) and the simplicity of customising your weapon layouts is fantastic. Easy to play, it was a pleasure.

However, as soon as any artist (by Art I mean game developers, film makers, musicians, etc.) becomes mainstream (now Black Squad is one of the most popular games in Steam) and massive, this is where an Art goes downhill.

I am a regular TDM only player, not casual though, I have got skill and I have an understanding of a team game. It's not there anymore. Every match I start (especially at the Storage map), today I face a storm of St.Valentine's day grenades the next second I respond, other players not knowing what a team playing is and blocking my visual sites (and dying), noobs with Sub Machine guns, cheaters the Battle Eye is not able to detect and many other annoying things.

As an ex-Quake Live player I should say that that game had the technology of evaluating your skill and always putting you to people of the skill similar to yours so there is a balance in game. In Black Squad TDMs today you end up with let's say first level noobs in your team against clan members in another and losing. I find it impossible to improve KAD ratio because of this factor (do not forget about St.Valentine's grenades still flying all over the map).

Every time I log in I receive a reward of another (I don't mean to be rude but that's the only word I can find) lame skin weapon I don't really need. Speaking about virtual money and the shop, I have got plenty of credits but there is nothing to spend them on because there are the same wepons and you just pay for a better skin of it once again, however their characteristics are as same as the original's ones. No point.

Players. They have studied the maps now. Found spots. Lots and lots of campers that ruin the game. Annoying behaviour of many. Kills the pleasure.

You may agree or disagree, but my feeling that something went wrong as soon as Black Squad has became mainstream has been growing over the last few months and it is getting stronger and that it's time to leave.

Sincerely Yours,

MistahG92"
15795,The game to be honest kind of sucks. Maps are too small and engagements feel slow. I also don't like the anime characters and military characters fighting with each other gives me CS Exreme v7 vibes (ugh). Overall the game feels lackluster and the weapons almost fire and feel all the same.
15796,"Very fun game for an hour or so then you realize all the problems, good boob physics

Desync kills it, characters are delayed
Grenades are an insta kill even if far away, nerf grenades
high ping servers
Spawn invincibilty lasts wayyyy to long, can kill 5 people before Im out of fresh spawn mode
Cant shoot through team mates in TDM and that sucks, trolls abuse it
Please add bullet collaterals, So bullets can go through more than 1 person
Teams are never balanced, could have gods on the other team and bots on mine
Matches freeze randomly 
some cheaters and hackers

Games needs to be fixed
But its free so like its worth a try considering its pretty fun"
15797,"csgo without hackers
dont have to be good at the game for good weapons, just play a decent amount
pretty fun
free !"
15798,"Good Game but..

Grenades need a nerf, you get shot through walls because the desync is the worst fucking thing in existance and if you get shot at by someone with spawn invincibility you can't beat them because it takes 10 years for it to disappear.

Needs to add..
Shooting through teamates in TDM
Collats."
15799,"There's a Quick match that you can't choose a server to play and you getting kick for high ping..
This game use to be my main game with the gang, now it's just sad
What a joke"
15800,"Although I started out with a somewhat positive review,the more I play it the more my review changes. For example the lag is bad,they lowered it to 200,what was it before 300?They need to lower even more to 100 max.When players south of the US get on the ping jumps drastically.They need to create a cloud server from Mexico down and leave Canada and United States on one server.

I cannot recommend this game until they fix the lag"
15801,czxczxczxcxc
15802,"Not really a P2W game but populated with wallhackers and macro users..specially Asian servers..Battleye is useless..and not even slowing down when aiming down sights?? not sure why they even bother adding aim down sights features for assualt rifles coz u can literally shoot accuractly while running lol..and also u can walk with same speed as running..
Dont waste ur time on this shit guys.."
15803,"this game is awesome
"
15804,Fun game but everything seems way to balanced.
15805,I really liked the practice mode in the game.
15806,"Similar concept to a lot of other games, hit boxes/damage are unusual to say the least. Some maps are very small and promote spawn camping in general. Also, it is the definition of micro transaction. Expiring weapons and grenades? Odd is a good work to describe it."
15807,"Good game i would say its like free CS:GO 

Lightmachinegunner here!!!!!!!!
"
15808,nice game
15809,"i had a blast playing it., the gameplay is so fast and it Succeed on delivering what you would expect from it as an FPS game"
15810,Dont know what to say about black squad :D
15811,mo dahora batendo trincando
15812,One of the good f2p fps games out there that doesn't suck.
15813,Very Nice
15814,the game is garbage with a nice cover but still garbage
15815,"No movement inaccuracy. Really?
And some fag comparing it to csgo. 
This game will die before full launch. Lots of hackers."
15816,"Highly Recommend, The best F2P FPS I have played so far. Feels like Counter Strike with slight COD Elements to it. not much I can complain about for the game overall, feels very rewarding and is really fun to play with in clans. 

Ignore all of these ridiculous reviews saying there is an insane amount of hackers because the truth of the matter is, that is false. 
I have played hundred of hours in this game and I have yet to undeniably determine someone is hacking. 

There is a learning curve on gun mechanics that will take getting used to. spray patterns are different for each gun and when Crouching/Standing/ADS. This is the biggest reason why players think someone is ""Hacking"" because they have not taken the time to learn the gun they are using and the opposing players know exactly what they are doing, in addition to using their ears, playing angles, aiming at head level, Voice communication, game experience, etc.

The competitive game mode is Demolition. Exactly like Counter Strike, (Search and Destroy in COD if you haven't played CS) a Vast majority of the top tier players play here. TDM for myself and clan mates is simply just a practice mode.  There is a highly competitive scene in this gametype. 
Queue for Demo 5v5, Demo 8v8 seems to be dead in North America and can be a little hectic. and late at night Queue times will increase drastically and you will end up playing the same players quite often. 

TDM is more of just run and gun chaos. 

Clan Matches are almost non existent in North America 90% of the time which makes it incredibly difficult to progress as a clan and play competitively. however Europes Clan servers tend to be rather packed during the day so we typically are forced to play EU with high ping in order to play clan matches at all.

Different maps for each gametype so that will throw you off a bit at first. 

4 Currencies available.
*Gold - For Grenades (For Rent) / Beginner weapons (All Permanent) / Gold Loot Crate 
*Medal - Guns that matter. You will want to purchase a gun using Medal as quick as possible to compete at higher skill levels. I Recommend the M4 for Accuracy it is the most stable AR in the game, AK12 or AK47 for High damage if you can remain calm, shoot in bursts, and hit headshots this is a 1 Bullet to the head kill gun.
*BS Coins - Used to buy common/rare skins for guns. 20,000 is the price for a rare skin, I have yet to meet anyone that has ever had this many. Typically a currency you can win by doing well in tournaments.
*Bullets - Real $ currency. Used to buy Boosters / Loot crates that drop rare skins (beware very low drop %) / New characters/ etc.

Could use some new Maps to freshen it up, especially in Team Deathmatch. a few TDM maps are way too small for the 8v8 or higher it tends to be packed with. I enjoy the overall design of the maps however Sky Scraper I feel is a terribly designed map and I dread playing it. 
Some Demolition maps are 1 sided. ""1 or 2 entry points to the plant site, when the other side has many more"" but that just adds to the competitiveness of the game type and I don't mind it. 

This game seems to have a much much bigger following in Korea, I am hoping this will also happen state side as the game comes out of Beta. 

I have very high hopes for this game on this side of the globe and the competitive scene is just now starting to move forward. 

Really hope to see more content in the future, New Maps, Skins, Characters as we move forward through Beta in order to keep the population growing. a lack of new content in the future will indefinitely tire out newer players and veteran players alike and become a dying game.  

Overall Lots of replay value for a Free to Play shooter. no need to spend any real money at all if you do not wish to do so.  8/10 for me, lets hope NS keeps this game fresh and moving in the right direction!

15817,"After putting way too much of my time into this game with my friends, I've decided for the most part I dont like it. It's really fun alot of the time, but then you get in matches with people that are obviously wallhacking and aimbotting, and it completely ruins it. Best advice I can give is play during the daytime, alot less hackers and shit are out then for some reason. This game could take off more if the devs ditched battleye and swapped for a different anticheat, or at least added a report system."
15818,Black Squad
15819,Lol this game is funny i play all kinda of fps but i play  on here aim bot heaven played a couple games was fun after that i noticed ppl using snipers just making insane 360 shots not really fun give the creators credit but community is aids!
15820,cool
15821,"React 25 milliseconds to late than your opponent? dead
Miss initial flinch 1 tap? dead
pre aimed a millimeter on your screen far from where enemy is going to pop up? dead
Enemy pressed crouch during span of 350 millisecond long gun fight, causing you to miss your burst? dead

A game for originally intended for asian market requiring you to sink thousand of hours of gameplay with end purpose is finally master 'ak47 recoil' and gain ability to flinch 1-tap heads with a sub 200 ms reaction time. And even if you master the recoil of a gun, the end spread is too random.

Everything is unrealistically too fast paced, too random and too repetitive. I had to review my own recorded gameplay footage in slow motion just so I can tell what went or what I did wrong.

Let alone the hackers running wild since it is a F2P game.

Hop in a pub server and have some fast paced fun on a TDM? Yes
Look into competitive scene or play this game competitively at all? Absolutely not"

15823,"Sooooooo good... Almost like Rainbow Six Siege!
Graphics are so good too!
Highly Recommended.

But... If you have a crappy computer well too bad you need good fps to play this game"

15828,csgo free..
15829,its the big gey srry did not like the game play at all
15830,Can u please add a battle royale mode....
15831,"this game is p2w, and broken. there is no skill invovled in this game, only advantage you have over the enemy is the p2w guns if you chose to buy them, since the p2w guns straight up outgun any other guns."

15835,Why i cant sell my AXMC INFERNO BOLD in steam market?
15836,"*THE GAME SHOULD BE DEAD*
1) never fix something what is broke
2) server fix from good to bad
3) fun yeah ofc some time 
4) smg are just amazing 
5) pingers always win 
6) hitreg/noregs/lag/stutter/fps drops  this never got fix 
7) snipers are jokes some time you can kill 1 bullet long range but in mid range just leave him 1hp
8) still better than csgo but feels like money hungry devs ....
9) ping limit must be 120 max not 300 cuz bots with 100kb/s can 1 tap you easy when you 1 tap them first but you will do no dmg at all for them (no fix for this)
10) update 41 hell yeah sound cracking everywhere more drops from 300fps to 1fps ez game ez life thx for amazing skins updates without fix/optimization
11) amazing memory leak issue 
12) even worst than it was back in 2018

15839,I like this game it is like COD a brand new level 10 out of 10 yea thx for making it free to play
15840,GG
15841,Best F2P shooter I've played. It feels as good as any call of duty game. My only complaint really is the lack of maps at the moment. Pretty good anti cheat too for being a free game.
15842,"Well, It's movements are quite unique from other generic FPS games aside from that the combat has it's fair share of unique/ness of it. I personnaly like the other aspects of it."
15843,outstanding and fast paced fun
15844,Changing the sound settings crahses my computer and the gunplay feels like a generic f2p shooter
15845,"Não gastes o teu tempo e dinheiro neste jogo, vou esxplicar porque.

1º o suporte não presta, os admins so querem dinheiro, e os developers do jogo e tudo hacker ( faz uma pesquisa sobre o jogo e vais ver por ti mesmo.

2º usa um antihack que invade a tua privacidade ( e so fazer uma pesquisa sobre o mesmo ).

3º esta infestado de hackers, entao os clans sao os piores duvidas? entao faz isto ( faz uma conta e usa um hack e vais ver que ate os admins tem hack, não uses o hack para teu benificio usa so para ver quem usa :) )

4º o jogo tem milhares de problemas, o jogo joga-se mas exite erros atraz de erros ( e so veres aqui no forum da steam )

5º os admins e mods removem os teus comentarios e criam contas para falar bem do jogo e dar nota boa sobre o mesmo.

6º este jogo esta perdido, assim como foi na coreia que faliu, e agora vem para a europa e americas roubar dinheiro.

15846,"absolute trash. Nibbas slowpeaking while crouched = advantage against roaming people. this game is so fucking cancer it fucking only promotes campin and nadespamming its so fuckking homosexyal and it fucking sells anime girls as a  fucking ""character"" this game is litterally the reason why i wanted hitler to have won so fag ass games like these never existed. 

fuck you, developers."

15850,This game is amazing. Guaranteed fun. Amazing grinding. It's just great!
15851,Well it's time to say goodbye
15852,Best FPS Game ever <3
15853,Great fps game. very tactical and competetive. It has gameplay elements like counter strike and cod. love it. wish all free 2 play games were like this.
15854,Game Suck!!!!!!!!!!
15855,Great game.
15856,"So after 3 days playing this game I can totally say that this is game is NOT P2W, but they did lied, this game have micro transactions and fortunately it's only for skins.

So at the beginning you will feel like people are destroying you because of their weapons, and it's kinda true but don't worry, you can get the exact same weapons in 3 hours, some weapons are very good especially compared to the basic ones and when I say SOME weapons I mean the majority of them, I played more than 200 FPS since I am kid and to be honest I've never seen a game where pretty much all the weapons are insane so that's a very good thing if you are looking for a game with a nice balance between weapons.

There's very few maps but this game is actually in beta, so I don't mind about that because they will probably release 20 more by the end of this year.

The skins, so first of all there's special pack that you can purchase for 80 cents, yeah 80 cents, that gives you 1200 bullets, with those 1200 bullets you can buy boxes (80 bullets ea) so basically 80 cents per loot box, since I clearly enjoyed this game I decided to buy the 80 cents pack and I don't know if it was RNG or this game is actually amazing but I got the M4 from my first box, then I got the OHK sniper and enough BS coins to buy myself a skin if I ever want to, so in basically 3 days I already got 10 weapons, a fucking skin and I even got a 50$ Karambit for 2 days ( free but it will expire)

Regarding cheaters, I haven't seen one yet, but to be honest I think this game will have cheaters since this game is kinda hard to play and it's free so kids will always try to cheat.

Also you can get 4 DLC for free in Steam that gives you the majority of the weapons in this game for 15 days so you can try them and buy yourself one when you want to, to buy a weapon by just playing the game will take you 3 to 4 hours and you usually get weapons when you open boxes that you get by just completing daily missions or leveling up, compared to others games like Crossfire when it used to take you a month to get a 7 days AK, this game is actually kinda nice.

If you are not sure about playing this game just trust me and do it, it's a very good F2P FPS."
15857,"I like the game. Easy on the eye, nice physics on movement and shooting.

Not hit a laggy server. Fast paced but not manic like Doom or Unreal.

Maps remind me of COD Black OP Nuke. Nice balance between camping and rushing players.

Just over an hour in. Not seen any hackers as yet. 

One of the best free to play shooters i've played in years. Congrats to the Devs - Nice job guys."
15858,"It's just your average run of the mill COD style FTP shooter, it's not in any way bad, and it definitely has it's moments (Holding middle mouse button to pull out your knife and run faster was a really good mechanic I thought). But on the whole it's just meh. Great if you want a few hours of mindless COD deathmatch, but beyond that I can't really recommend it. Not to mention you have to adjust mouse sensitivity for each separate loadout, which is a major pain in the ass."
15859,[b] Nice game	[/b]

15862,great game with nice graphics its awesome 2019
15863,i just love this game so much
15864,Best free fps shooter game available on steam !
15865,It free ! but i like
15866,"At first I thought this game was total shit, no servers found, dead playerbase, but after a couple of months of ignoring this game I decided to revisit this game to see if it was still bad, and to my suprise it's actually not that bad from what I thought it was. I mena yeah there's like no recoil but who gives a fuck. The sniping is pretty fun, when you buya  weapon you get it PERMANENTLY unlike other free Fps games where if you buy a weapon you only get it for ""Insert Time Here"". 

7/10 Decent"
15867,;
15868,"UI is terrible, sound design is terrible, you can't adjust your settings in the tutorials (which is like THE place wher you'd want to adjust and try them).  Struggled to join a game with my friend, we did one game and uninstalled.

Gameplay is not that bad, but the whole experience was. And even in game you are reminded of that terribleness with those terribles sounds choices and visual effects.

Big nope for me."
15869,N1 4 FREE
15870,It is best to play MC5 instead of Black Squad .
15871,This game is a pretty good FPS...   I just wish they wouldnt have so many updates.
15872,"the game play is alright althogh I do seem to have a glitch every other game. My aim suddenly becomes sluggish to the point where i need my entire desk just to turn 45 degrees. I've tried everything I can think of yet it still happens after the first match and will stay that way until i restart the game. It's a shame really as this means i can only play 1 round before having to restart the entire game.
"
15873,BUNCH OF FILTHY HACKERS DON'T PLAY THIS GAME
15874,Absolutely no Pay-to-Win. :^)
15875,"Nice game. I like the effects and the ""inventory organisation"". Would be perfect with better graphics and more attention to detect some hackers (not so many)."
15876,"very good
:)
"
15877,"Played one game, it's garbage. Could only get into a custom match. The player base is really easy (if it's not hacking). Encountered two aimbots first game.  Sound is generic as it gets. Directional sound is terrible. Wouldn't waste 5 more minutes on this game. I got this game because I wanted an aim trainer to practice with. The sensitivity was too low when i first got in game, and they have 5 different presets for sensitivity. I had no idea which one was which. I had to adjust all 5 to get the sensitivity i need. I wouldn't bother with this game. Free to play is too expensive, you'd have to pay me to play this game."
15878,Black
15879,Cool Game Like Cs. Need Bit of Time to Master it :)
15880,"Good things:
 - Free
 - Poor Man's CS:GO

Bad things:
 - Extremely long wait time
 - Unsatisfying kills
 - Basically a poor man's CS:GO
 - Weak guns except for the LMGs"

15882,very great appreciated 1rst person shoter game
15883,"The game combines the best parts of CSGO and Black Ops, its an amazing game I highly recomend."
15884,This game is not that bad at all the first time i played it
15885,"Game is fun.

Might have the worst servers of any game I have ever played.  Untill they take some incentive and fix that, negative review from myself."
15886,game is good
15887,"This game is fun to play...love the game style and play...modes are fun.

Way to many cheats...and no easy way to report them.
The cheaters laugh about how they can not be removed...

Shame cause the game is honestley fun."
15888,"This game was fun for a while. Then you relized it is always asking you to insert your money for bosts or the like super play to win like. 
From there the game machanics are basicly who can camp the other team harder like thats it. Spawns never change your always on the same side and either your killing or killed. 
The player base oh my lord is so toxic its not even funny its like this game wants to be counterstrike but so much worse. 
In some if you want to play this give it a try but i say pass there are so many other games that do this way way better."

15890,Terrible p2w game

4 - Bad HITBOX

~Shit Game~"
15892,"Its a full of hacking games, this fucking games community sell the hacking software fuck fuck fuck fuck ......."
15893,Game is too easy
15894,The maps are confusing and VERY small. Sometimes people oneshot you with a shot to the chest and sometimes with a headshot.
15895,"Long Story Short: Its a good shooter game for the money (none)

This game is a decent FPS game with a few modes, including team deathmatch, demolition, and assasination, and some other modes I haven't played yet. I usually play team deathmatch the most, and the gameplay is fairly balanced most of the time. The good variety of maps wont bore most players out in the first hour. They do have a loot crate system, but I don't use it. There are some hackers that lurk within the game, most notably, aimbots, but they don't pop up every game (they're probably hanging around in COD or CSGO). They do have a decent variety of guns available to buy with the basic currency as well as these ""medals"", which you get for leveling up or completing tasks, which can get you better guns. Overall, considering the price, it's a decent game."
15896,its a shooter idk much about shooters but it makes more or less fun
15897,I love this game soo much but I would like you to add more maps and add GL to all weapons like in indo. And Korea and make a discount to the Bullets because it's too expensive and I have a yt channel that iam uploads only bs videos and thx for proving us the game
15898,Nice 1
15899,"Good f2p game. Cs + cod. Negatives - takes forever to earn medals , temporary weapons unless bought with credits ( limited options ) or medals ( see beginning). And attachments and weapon sights are pre/determined to that specific weapon. So if you want a certain weapon it might have a bad / worse sight attached and it's default ( you can't change it ) to that specific gun. Plus - sniping is amazing and aiming is very precise. Free , a better alternative to CS and adds a new appeal to cod. Smg's seem very weak compared to the other weapons tho.

UPDATE / wont play anymore because requires battleye"
15900,"7/10 Needs work to the servers and maybe online/ingame mods to ban or kick the odd hacking player. only seen 4-5 hackers out of 335 hours of playing so not bad. pingers are a problem.......need more guns. ...Will stab more people now
:D"
15901,"This used to be a really fun game. Constant action, lots of kills, and quickly back in the action after death. Lately though? You'll spend upwards of 2-3 minutes waiting for a match to form, only to enter a game that isn't the 8v8 you expected... instead it'll be 1v1 or 2v1. After dying multiple times and wondering what the heck happened to filling a lobby, you'll likely quit. Rinse& Repeat.

The fun continues when you get someone with an aimbot cheat... 150 to 3 K:D ratios anyone? I've really enjoyed this game, but it's hard to play for more than 20 minutes at a time; you'll likely be so frustrated it'll cause a rage quit.

"
15902,very naice!
15903,not bad for a free FPS
15904,"very good game, graphics are a little no existant but overall agme is unreal."
15905,good shit
15906,"Warface like microtransactions,  extremely low skin crate drop rates. Scummy. Servers are decent in performance really, good concept of the game, yet this could be replaced by other fps multiplayer games ALSO regaurdless of microtransactions being "" Optional "" It shouldn't be implemented in the most cutthroat way. Even CS:GO does better than this in the crate and key microtransaction industry, this is pathetic to see weapon skins being low drop rates and all you get is grenades and smoke screens, A literal microtransaction clone of Warface. Good/decent game overall, but very shallow and shady business practices in Microtransactions. Worth a shot but stay away from the horrendous microtransactions, as a warning you will ultimately waste your money on trying to get a weapon skin which honestly should be unlockables or a more genuine way such as CS:GO."
15907,awesome game just need server in south africa please
15908,It is a very Interesting game. Full of Action and it is fun to play i am expecting some Competitive Updates Really soon! Keep up the good work and this game will be a Master Piece. :D
15909,good game
15910,"The Game is awesome.As for free to play this game is having best tactical physics i have ever seen.However this is still beta means it's not release yet(as per steam), so many updates are yet to come.As for players you don't have to worry it's increasing at good rate as excpeted.Best thing is system requirments. JUST GO PLAY THE GAME TO SEE WHAT I AM SAYING IS TRUE OR NOT."

15913,"As a Closed Beta Player, I can say, this game has come a long way, I look forward to what comes in the future, there are tons of weapons to choose from, its not pay-to-win, the community is friendly, active & quite helpful, on average finding a match takes 10 seconds, the anti-cheat is amazing so exploiters are never an issue, graphics are fairly decent, gameplay is smooth."

15917,Micro transaction done right.
15918,"It is a great game if you wish to not spen money on games like ""Rainbow 6""        8/10"
15919,"the game was fun but the developers don't know much about firearms a smg isn't more accurate then a rifle but the devs sure think so as they made it that way so players running around with their mp5s can hit you more then you can with your full sized rifle which is just dumb, take note devs smgs have shorter barrels and fire pistol ammo, a shorter barrel has less accuracy then a longer barrel.  If they changed things to be how things are actually supposed to be then I'd change my mind on this."
15920,"From the ~30 minutes I played this game I saw/experienced:

A terrible, unintuitive, cluttered UI
Ear-piercing sounds. And I mean it. Lower the game volume as soon as you can
A cheater
A tutorial that holds your hand so much yet at the same time most of the things I learned from it became completely useless once I got into deathmatch (the game tells you to hold your mouse wheel button to run faster, instead of just telling you to press 3 to switch to your knife, plus other mechanics that don't seem to work)

Seriously, the game tells me I've earned a reward and I'm like ""cool"". Then it tells me that to redeem it I have to go to my ""Inbox"", you know, like e-mail inboxes, instead of just auto-redeem it. I got a grenade, yet when I get ingame I can't use it. Apparently I have to go through the worst menus ever to equip it. Thanks for not telling me, game.

This game tries to be a mix of COD and CS but flops overall. Maybe I'll try it again when the menus aren't terrible.

Edit: 

I played the game again and holy fuck, the grenade spam is terrible. Also I noticed that there are 2 maps for TDM. There's constant micro-freezing as well, especially at the start. And the grenades can't be bought permanently. If that's your proposed solution to the godawful grenade spam then it's not working at all."
15921,"Black Squad is a multiplayer first-person-shooter game developed by NS STUDIO.

The idea of the game is probably familiar with everyone who has been into pc gaming.
First I thought this would be a ripoff from cs:go but developers surprised me in a good way.

In Black Squad 2 teams with 5 players each fight each other. There are team ""Viper Circle"" who are terrorists and team ""Peacemakers"" who are like police/special forces. Viper circle wins if they manage to eliminate the enemy team or explode the bomb at planting site. Peacemakers naturally try to defuse the bomb or eliminate the enemy team.

In game you will be allowed to use 3 different weapon loadouts you can create in your inventory. Weapon loadout includes primary weapon, secondary weapon, knife and 2 optional grenades ( smoke, flash or explosive )

Black Squad uses its own store where you could buy guns, knives, grenades, characters, backgrounds etc.
There are 4 different currencies in BS:

Gold is the most common currency. It can be earned by playing games or opening boxes. You'll also get some from daily rewards and completed missions. With gold you can buy the most basic equipment such as weapons without skins and grenades. When you start the game you will receive some gold (around 200k) as starter reward to buy some weapons.

Medals are rarer than gold but it could still be earned pretty easily by daily rewards, completed missions and opened boxes. With medals you'll be allowed to buy more unusual stuff like weapons with skins, different knives and backgrounds.

BS Coin is the rarest currency that can be collected without paying real money. It sometimes drops from boxes. With BS Coins you'll be able to buy the top gear of the game like weapons with very lovely skins and characters. BS Coins are kinda hard to get. In a couple weeks you could get like 600-900 BS Coins if you are lucky.

Bullets are the premium currency of BS. They can be bought from shop and they cost normally like 1€ / 80 Bullets but during events you could find some sweet sales offering bullets with discounts like -90%. With bullets you could buy special boxes where you can get some really nice stuff such as golden grenades and guns with beautiful skins.

Note: Gun skins bought from shop also include the gun. For example if you do not own AK47 but you'd like to buy a skin for it, you don't need to buy the normal gun without skin in order to use the skin.

In Black Squad there are many different game modes such as 5vs5 Demilition, 8vs8 Demilition, Deathmatch, Assassination and Destruction. Game also offers 4 different game options: Quick Match, Custom match, Clan match ( you could play with you friends who are in the same clan ) and Competition match.

Gameplay: 9,5/10, Near perfect gameplay. Good luck developer. In-game mechanics and physics are realistic and pleasant. In this game you have to know the maps and spots in order to be good as player but this game is also easy to learn. I haven't seen any bugs that have affected my gameplay. Only ""bug"" I have seen is that while playing left handed and planting the bomb, numbers and text on the bomb are mirrored from right handed bomb. Idk, this isn't really a bug, developer was just a bit lazy :P

Graphics: 8,5/10, Graphics for guns and maps are pretty detailed and beautiful. There are a ton of different maps that all look completely different from each other. Some animated gun skins look hella awesome with their effects like cherry leaves spreading everywhere while reloading. I would still like a nature map (like a forest or a mountain) for this game like in call of duty.

Soundtrack: 8/10, Soundtrack is ok, (althought headshotting an enemy sounds like crushing a coca cola can.) Menu song is just epic I recommend listening to it :D and in game radio voice is funny.

Story: There are no story, this is fps game tho.
Multiplayer: Yes, duh this is multiplayer shooter.

Minimum computer for this game: You won't need a good computer to run this game decently. A medium computer is enough for this. My medium computer runs easily smooth 199 Fps ( yeah its the default max fps ) with high graphic settings. Only few fps drops can be seen while spawning to the map.

Altogether this is a lovely and good fps online game even that this game is totally free to play and all microtransactions are completely cosmetic and won't affect the gameplay much. I suggest you to even try this game before judging.
With a friend you'll totally enjoy Black Squad's gameplay and teammates who are blind and have garbage aim ;D"
15922,"This game is the worst thing I've ever played. I would rather kill my baby children than ever look at an istall button next to this game ever again. I regret thinking about this game. While playing the tutorial I triad to drown myself in my own faeces at least four times. I forget the exact number because I blacked after beating my head against my desk trying to forget the things it whispered to me. 6.5/10, it was decent but needs more work."
15923,nice game perfect time pass
15924,"Just another asian CS ripoff. Menus suck, in-game mechanics are shallow. Netcode is okay but since when does that make it a good game? There is nothing special about Black Squad."
15925,mouse doesnt move while spam clicking
15926,Game is so laggy that it is almost unplayable at times. I have a 200 MBPS connection and have no issues on any other game. When you are being shot at the FPS drops to 10. The game also freezes when you die. whole game locks up.
15927,A very great game. Everybody should try it. I just love it!
15928,"This game is so Good !
BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A ZOMBIE MODE !!! srsly !

15929,over all pretty good game for being free/micropurchases i like the feeling of it and the graphics are definetly good! id recommend checking it out!
15930,"i thought that this game was going to be a bit like cs-go but no it's alot more better for those who are new to games like this so if i was to rate this game out of 10 i would give it 7/10 only because i think getting money could be alot easier. and i also like the fact that you guys make sales for buying in the online store.

15935,its an OK fps shooter. has lots of room for improvment.idk why theres no communication with team. and this game feels annoying after few matches at a time.
15936,"This game is one of my top f2p games.

Most of the bad reviews are that there are too many cheaters I've been playing for a little while and never seen a hacker.
I think that there just bad players who haven't come for pc shooters and don't know how to play.

The weapons are fun and mostly balanced because there's not much difference between them and if there is it will have a downside.

I recommend this game for people want a fun, free and easy to get into game"
15937,nice

15943,The new Crossfire
15944,This game is now Sh*T....Played 809 hours...
15945,"Fun game
"
15946,My first review was a good one for this game. I have been away from the game for a bit and came back recently. I used to get pretty good framerates and could get onto a match with fairly low ping. Now I can get onto a map and I get 5 minutes of game play (lag to the max) and then it crashes. It doesn't just kick me from the match the game literally crashes. Used to love this game and somehow the developers have made it unplayable for Australian users.
15947,"yeah this game is good i think if you want free game and FPS (First Person Shooter) you must try Black Squad for a more bloody good feeling. i recomend this game :) and my friend also likes it

I'll give this a 9.5/10.

15966,"-Download the game
-Completed the tutorial 
-Recieved a loot box
-Opened the box
-A knife skin for 3 days
-Uninstalled the game."
15967,"This game was fun at first but it has major flaws that can't be overlooked, and I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to flawed free to play games. 

-Maps are unbelivably small, like 1/3 the size of a regular call of duty map. Most maps you can shoot from one spawn to the other, and throw grenades from spawn to spawn. There is next to no verticality on the maps and every spawn consists of shooting and walking forwards until an enemy with spawn protection kills you. Seriously thats it.

-I enjoy permenant weapons but the lack of variety really hurts my desire to keep playing. If you have a sniper, an AR, and a pistol then thats all you need.

-weapons have attachments but they cannot be removed or modified. This is strange, for example if your assualt rifle has a holo sight and you would like to use iron sights, well you can't. There could have been a lot more insentive to play you could unlock customization. 

-Finally, I am not against cosmetic unlocks/purchases, but this game, especially with new inclusion of trading and the steam market, has been focusing more developer effort on adding new cosmetics rather than keeping the gameplay fresh. 

All said, this game has the SMALLEST maps for any fps i've ever played and is boring after a few hours."
15968,"I just got to give everyone a headsup if they want to try this game. 
They thought this would be the next AvA, sadly its not even close to being that ""good"".

pro's:
 - Reasonable active communitie and moderators/developers!
 - core gameplay is good, not new or innovating but just good.
 - Don't know any more than those 2 above

con's:
 - Netcode, hit reg, latency or however you want to look at it, it just dusn't work. 
 - Getting kills for missing, but shoot the guy when he walks and not a single bullet seems to be capable of killing him.
 - Assault rifle's are divided in 2, either spray and pray or aim and hs. Sub machine guns are just spray and pray aiming has little to no benefite. Snipers are just 1-hit kill with a 50/50 chance at body shot's, so that seem's oke.
 - I do know more, but they aren't relevent to this review.

This is just my OPINION of the the game. This could be your hidden gem amongst the free to play fps games.

15980,"Update 3 (Original reviews are followed)

I need to add that in response to the massive number of complaints about cheating they have now added an in-game report system. Probably too soon to see the long term effect on the players but as of now, 19th of April 2020, the cheating is still not subtle and sporadic. People use very obvious types of cheats such as aim bots and dodge bots frequently. And the number of players is also still diminishing. Wait 2 minutes to join a game where the same cheaters that ruined the previous game are present.

-------------------
Update 2

In its current state the game is absolutely NOT recommended for 2 reasons:
1. Cheaters:
I have played online shooter games for ages. There is always an occasional cheater. You report them or not, they somehow survive for a while. Then they get  bored or they get banned. It's always the same. You see one cheater every few matches. You laugh at their stupidity or you warn them that they'll get reported and you move on.

But then sometimes a game gets to a state where they get a 50 to 5 k/d with obvious cheats And then at the end of the game they don't even try to calm things down. They are adamant and provocative too. That's the point you realise they KNOW they're not gonna get caught.

The policy of this game on reporting cheaters was bad to begin with. Go register online and fill a form and remember what the offender's IGN was and what not. Fine. I was actually reporting them still. Not many. I reported 4 or 5 in about 100 hours or so of gameplay. Then they started with things like ""you must submit a video with your report""! Of what? What can I possibly provide in a 30fps video that you can not see in your server log at a much higher resolution? It's not my job to analyse the game. You're the developer! So basically they gave it up. BattleEye was their only line of defence and that was not bad for a while but it is in the state that you can read about in PUBG reviews. It is now showing its shortcomings here too. And since the developer did not invest in the manpower to deal with this on their own, the current state of the game was inevitable.

2. Lag:
Part of this also goes with the above point. There is no good mechanism of dealing with players who deliberately lag. BUT, a good design of client-server with good geographical classification of players would render so-called lag switching ineffective. We did have that in this game a while back. But then they reduced the gun stability punishment for running and gunning in recent months. This means the gun with high fire rate has a higher chance of killing at a distance than a precise sniper rifle. You just spam A-D and spray in the direction of the sniper who needs to take that one shot right. It is extremely unbalanced. By the time the projectile from the sniper gets to the other side, the target has moved left and right a couple of times already! That does not make any sense in terms of game design and certainly encourages deliberate lagging. But well, in order to be able to gather players from around the world into the same server (as the number of players diminishes) they have to compensate for the laggy players. And here we are

This was not a bad game. But its fate is pretty much obvious now. We've seen this happening to many games before. It's all downhill from here.
---------

Older reviews
Two edits:
1. The game absolutely has no pay wall. What you buy is mostly cosmatic and even ""accellerator"" items don't really give a big edge. Play the game for free and pay for the cosmatics if you feel like you want to support the developer.

2. My biggest praise of the game was that it was tough on cheaters.
Apparently no longer. It has reached a point that they are not trying to hide their behavior anymore.
I don't want to enter the technicalities here but when you see cheaters stream their game and make obvious predictions of enemy behind the wall or twitch kill with 180 degree turns, you know they don't feel any danger of a ban.
Since this game is still in development and the developer has been actively listening to us and fixing issues in past, my review is still positive. I will switch side when I reach a point that I have no hope for this game anymore.

---------------------------------------------------

I am going to give this game a positive review since it is an ongoing development but in its current state it does not really deserve my praise for a couple of reasons.

What is good about this:
1. Deals with cheaters. Yes, there are still cheaters who get away but compared to what I have seen in tens of different shooter PVP games that I have played throughout the years, this one is a big winner. I see players get banned left and right and I am loving it. In most other games I have to report somebody once every couple of games. Here, so far in almost 50 hours of gameplay, I have only once been sure enough to report somebody.
2. They take care of things. High ping players who get everybody's game ruined do get kicked. The sit/stand spam solution is in the works and... They listen to community.
3. Game is fun. It can be frustrating but even if you don't win, you still can enjoy. It is action-packed and when you die you don't have to watch a long count-down to respawn and then walk accross the map to get back to action.
4. They have found a nice balance of paid-for items with real money and virtual money. Real money does give you an edge but you don't feel left behind if you don't spend real money. And I need to add, prices are also fairly reasonable compared to some competitor games.
5. I have to add this though it is fairly personal: After Ghost in the Shell First Assault Online was closed I tried everything out there I could find. This is closest thing I found (More on this in negatives).
6. Fairly polished game for a beta. Not a lot of bugs. Plays smoothly. Has nice graphics. And is in active development.
7. Its servers are full of people. On certain times of day/week you are in the game after only a few seconds of queing up.

So, with that much good, what can I possibly have against it:
1. Everything actively encourages you to run and gun. Moving, jumpung, sitting and standing do have their aim penalty but still it is a game where people who run into the enemy line get far better results than ones who tachtically contribute to their team by covering a corridor.
2. Like most pvp shooters it is a punishment for the sniper. Although I have to admit, it is not as bad as most of them: There are maps where you really feel what a sniper does: periods of time with no action followed by an opportunity of a fraction of second you absolutely must not miss. Having said that, still due to networked nature of the game, you do witness a lot that the guy who jumps out of cover and sprays a handfull of bullets does get the sniper who did a perfect job of aiming but missed due to network lag.
3. There is no diversity. At least in its current state (and I believe this is going to change) you don't have specialization. Fairly similar looking characters, same health, same guns, no abilities or skills. I am not saying it should become an RPG but one major thing this game has missing compared to First Assault Online, is diversity which spices things up and stops things from becoming repetitious.
4. May be I am paranoid but I am seeing this in quite a lot of games lately: If you don't play the game for a while or you lose a few, the matching system does things in your favor. If you spend a lot of time in the game or start improving your ranking, you become expendable by giving others an edge in the matchmaking. It is obvious why developers are moving in this direction but I don't like it.

So, final verdict:
Keep an eye on this game. It has potential. It can become really big. In its current state it is fun but still not my go-to for my shooter fix!"
15981,The game is not something you want to play. It is full of cheaters !!! I think developers do nothing aginst it and actually cant do anything. Weapons suck. Assault riffles are too weak. SMG and LMG too strong. Reloading SMG and LMG takes the same time. Running with any weapon is same. Noobtubes are using LMG for that reason. Snipers are like with aimbots and have a fire rate almost like assault riffle. Snipers are definitvly too strong in this game. But these are all things that developers can fix. But cheaters I dont think they can or will. So spare your nerves and buy a decent game.
15982,"I really REALLY wanted to like this game. But sadly in its current state, it's a mess. I hope they can improve it in its full release. It has a lot going for it. I wish them the best of luck until then."
15983,amazing game love it i recommand you guys to buy this game it amazing

Play literally anything else. You'd have a better time."

This game should be more famous, this is one of the best free to play games I've ever played"
15997,"This game does not need more pretty skins, it needs to be fixed! You fixed the crouch spam, which wasnt even a thing compared to bunny hopping! Now I cant properly tea bag the twat that is bunny hopping!


I dont even know if i would recommend this game. You know this game, its just like all the other F2P shooters out there. one thing that I dont like about this game is the four different types of in game currency. why is that needed? there should only be two, the type you earn and the type you buy. I am on typing this because I have a new keyboard and after playing the game I am quite bored



edit- honestly this game pretty much sucks, if you love bunny hopping, spawn camping and spamming a shotgun, you might like this game, otherwise steer clear, it aint worth the download to play this uninspired fps

edit-it should be pointed out that this is not a pay to win game, which is good. I have changed my recommendation of this game based on that alone.

Final update-5 rounds played today, every single one my team was stuck in the spawn with people lobbing grenades and sniping us as soon as the short respawn safety had expired. I am sure that it was fun for the other team, but that leaves half of the players wondering why the fuck they are even playing.This game is broken. Avoid for your own sanity."

16006,This game is facking terrible. It's free but I still feel ripped off?
16007,Let me preface this with I HAVEN’T played very long. It may get better but the game might get better overall or it may just not be the kind of game for me. This review is my opinion and if you don’t like it I’m sorry but move on. The controls are junk and gameplay is slow and monotonous. No real story to it and god forbid they take some time for the graphic improvements. Overall I wouldn’t recommend this game to anybody.
16008,niceuu
16009,asdwwwwwwww
16010,Great Multiplayer game. Love the fact that it is kept simple and not overcomplicated. Start the game and you are ready to go!
16011,I downloaded this game about 4 - 5 days ago just to check my ping on the Dev server because I am interested to play Bless Online. I uninstalled the game after about 10 minutes (as you can see with my play time). Today I receive a message that I am permanently banned from this game? O_o I don't know what to think about this but if this is how their anti-whatever device works then I'll be sure as hell to steer clear from Bless Online.
16012,one of the worst game ever foolish game always crashing like a little bitch idiot stupid mc bc
16013,gerat game play but the free to plays suck
16014,"kool


(rip 2021)"
16015,Im not a fan of free games but WOW! Basically this game takes the fun and addictng games of Call of Duty (early ones) and CS:GO and mashes them together. Very low time to kill but kills are so satisfying! Pay to win elements are present since this is still a free game but it is one everyone should know about!
16016,"pretty good
"
16017,"This game would actually be pretty good if there were a few things different:
There is no way to train with bots that actually fight back, just spawning in bots.
Sniper rifles are only at all accurate when you've been standing still for 1 second, compared to how every other gun retains accuracy even when constantly moving.
The hit detection seems to have a .5 second delay, which is a pain.
It takes 20 years to find a lobby, either it comes instantly or you might as well uninstall and try again next year."
16018,"Well, it's a free game so you can get it if want. I think this game is so underrated due to the fact it gets compared to other first person shooters like csgo and call of duty which are obviously more designed and popular. I guess it's a decent game but definitly not a game I would grind in..."
16019,lol its ehhhhh but its pretty fun kind of but I'm not a fps type of person so I have nothing to compare it to really
16020,"If you are searching for a less played, worse looking and not working version of csgo that was made 2008 then look no further than black squad, where the only positive thing about the game is that you are able to deinstall it again"
16021,OMG a fantastic game for fps lover..... create skill & just play You will love it
16022,It´s pretty good.
16023,"The last sentence of the brief description says it all.

The bastard child of COD and CS (and maybe Warface). Good gunplay, better netcode than PUBG and no P2W.
My only complaint is the run-and-gunning, accuracy doesn't change at all lo

If you're not that rich, want to have another level of experience, want to have some fun or just forget about your 10-lose-streak in CS:GO, then get it."

16027,"[h1]The game is free, for a game that has good mechanics and graphics, being free is very generous.

This is all I have to say for now.[/h1]"

Only little happen that I found nobody use hack in match

(check out the comments from the community thats what you will deal with in game. pretty much the csgo community)"

16040,GOOD! VERRY GOOD FOR ITS GENERE!
16041,Its a free to play but not pay to win better version of CoD. You start with loads of in game currency so you can buy one or two of the best weapons of the bat. Recommended if you want a simple fun free to play shooter
16042,gave a chance but didn`t liked
16043,"Good game for a casual timepass like Counter Strike GO but free. Not that great graphics and servers lag sometimes. Also the korean chineese aesthetic in designs is not my thing. 
But still fun to play and fast paced action. 
One downside is that most maps are too small and cramped and spawn points are too limited."
16044,"A free copy of CSGO, but it's more awesome and outstanding graphics!!!!"
16045,"[h1] Black Squad [/h1]

positive:
[list]
[*]good performance
[*]free to play
[*]almost no pay to win
[/list]

negative:
[list]
[*]too many cheaters/hackers
[*]bad weapon balancing
[*]horrible matchmaking

16046,"It's a really nice game!!!
"
16047,"-WARNING- There will be tryhards.

Other than that the game is really good in my opinion. 9/10"
16048,"Combination of CS and COD :p Nice Gameplay and Weapons. Need Voice Chat . One of the free to play game which has massive user support, need improvement tho."
16049,nice game fuck archer. i felt noob everytime i play with them .
16050,"So i have been playing Black Squad for a few months now, and i thought it was time for me to voice my opinion on the game.

When i first downloaded the game, i had a CoD/CSGO mixture feeling, and i thought that alot of the stuff in the game was derivative of CSGO. But as a clocked in more and more hours, suddenly i had a feeling of originality.
I didn't mind the graphics, since i have a low-end pc, it was fine. Especially for a free game.

The game is a really fun fast-pace style of game, which leads to a lot of stress. But fun stress.
Unlike so many of you, i haven't come across many hackers, i've seen a few get kicked by BattlEye, but i haven't noticed any hacks.
And like someone else said, spawncamping is a problem, but i have no idea on how they would fix this without upsetting everyone.
And in game voice chat? **** yes!!! Only problem is toxic people. A LOT of toxic people. 

Otherwise lovely community!

There is one problem with a TDM map though.
Everytime i play on Revenge, my fps drops instantly?? 
Also, people with a ping over 110 should not be allowed to play any match ever. Not even in custom.

To summarize: I absolutely love this game. Keep up the good work devs!"
16051,"it's suck a good game
"
16052,"believe me guys, this is awesome. Best alternative for CS:GO and it's free"
16053,Get Warface instead
16054,"A fun run and gun game, although it doesn't have that ""touch"" that makes the real good fps, heck man, it's for free and it's actually pretty good
"
16055,i love it
16056,Great FPS game for free. Worth downloading it’s a lot of fun
16057,Great game ever
16058,The best!!
16059,"Goood play
"
16060,"boi boi boi, I recommend this game braos"
16061,Fire
16062,"Fucking great time killer. I enjoy it from time to time whenever I download the game :D
Definitely a great game for FPS starters or those who want to try something different from COD and CS."
16063,good game very fun i dont play it a wholer lot but pretty fun m8
16064,This Game is good
16065,Great free to play game with nice graphics and game movements. Recommended to download and play and also play for a longer period of time as there arent hackers on this game yet. I hope there wont be any either. :P
16066,This game is the worst game i have ever played. The ammount of bad connections and servers make this game unplayable. The ammount of players that can cheat because battleeye is terrible is astonishing and i dont know what makes devs think battleye is a good thing. this game should be taken down for how bad it is
16067,"Great Great, not Pay to win at all."
16068,Only Way to describe Korean Shooter
16069,"Great game but please fix the lag spikes.

Also sort TDM maps and make them bigger or at least have the reswawn points swapped around a bit"
16070,meh works
16071,The worst game ever played
16072,"Pro's: 
-The overall gameplay is awesome
-Demolition mode is really fun and competitive especially when you are playing against clans
- Clan ranked matches can get really sweaty and competitive too!
- There's  a really good selection of guns and lots to choose from, and everything seems really balanced
- There is no P2W in this game at all. 
- Graphics are really nice
- The map designs are interesting and different than games like CS:GO
- Pretty solid community, you run into alot of the same players and form friendships (or rivarlies sometimes)
- The netcode seems pretty solid I personally don't get alot of lag nor lag spikes



Cons:
- Needs more players (around 5-10k players currently) you end up playing alot of the same people all the time 
- The prices for some of the skins in the cash shop are rediciulous. You can't just buy skins outright in this game, you have to purchase bullets which you then use to open up loot boxes. You have a very rare chance of getting a skin in one of the loot boxes, otherwise you have to hope you open up what they call 'BS Coins' in these boxes. It costs 20,000 BS Coins to purchase a skin. It takes forever to get to 20,000 BS Coins unless you're spending money everyday in game.
-The map designs are interesting, but some of the maps are really aids 
- There are hackers, especially people who use wall hacks.
- Needs more maps
- IT DESPERATELY NEEDS MORE GAME MODES. I.E. CAPTURE THE FLAG, KING OF THE HILL ETC. Currently, there's really only two game modes people play in this game; TDM and Demolition model. 


Overall the game is actually really good, and for a f2p fps game, you really can't go wrong by downloading it. The pro's outweigh the cons in my opinion, the biggest thing they need to work on is more game modes, maps and more players.
"
16073,Good stuff.
16074,i love black squad
16075,suka Blyat
16076,Add mo f*cking Australia servers
16077,"not enough player in SEA server, Playerbase still sucks
lag and reg issue always 
can't compete in competitive because of Waller and hacker 
don't waste or invest your money in this game 
this game does not have any future, NS studio was bad but they never lead the game to DEAD END.
they fucked up with market policy now they are ruining it again, now they are forcing to buy in game bullet and buy skin.

Remember ""VALOFE"" only cares about money, they always think about what they should add in shop in order to make money. I’m not sure that they care that much about the community.

Honestly I don’t have any hope on this game, I was so much disappointed and it broke something, but the nostalgia makes me keep playing this game idk how to explain it

Peace! out"
16078,Best fuckin Fps Game
16079,CSGO but not trash
16080,Just another CROSSFIRE game. The controling is SUCK.
16081,"Have blazer-airplane
I want seal-pup damascus
"
16082,"Black Squad is a really fun game. It's quite enjoyable its this mix of counter strike and call of duty, but isnt this generic clone you would expect. black squad somehow manages to surpass them both in my oppinion its really well made the support team is awsome they are really helpfull and the developers keep the game constantly updated and well managed. the ingame reward system is good and the game provides a fair competetive playing field if you want to play seriously and alot of gamemodes where you can rush in gunsblazing which overall is a very fun experience
"
16083,ez
16084,"Imagine war inc, (that free to play shooter went under in 2004.)
This game feels slow and clunky, the tutorial is bad, there is a gear rental system, female player models are paid, aiming down sites gives no accuracy advantage, there may be cheaters (one guy in our lobby headshot literally everybody), customization is not present, the lobby system is horribly confusing for parties. Just avoid it and play one of the other shooters out there."
16085,"BAsically CS:GO, but F2P"
16086,bad
16087,Great game
16088,"Major rubber-banding issue.
Not worth it. Servers are garbage and not worth any of the investment when people can't even play the game 
Shotguns are useless. Machine pistols are useless. 
Maps are restricted to corridor fights where everyone body-blocks and there's only one active mode and that's arms race (It gets boring real quick)

Don't think this game has much legs to stand on."
16089,Boring game with hackers everywhere and a ingame store that is worse than Call of Duty's supply drop system. P2W game with alot of potiential. Now one of the officers from the members list of this game has told me to either take this review down or rewrite it to say something good about it...lol.
16090,TAC RELOAD
16091,"I think making the charcters faster or adding a sprint to the charcters would make the game a lot better.

16092,Better than CS
16093,"[h1] GAME: RUN & GUN = Run Spray and Pray! [/h1]

[u] Why i not recommended it after 700h+ [/u]

[b]
- Unbalanced gameplay, teams, guns. (everyone's play with no recoil MDR, M4, ACR)

- Cheaters.

- No region lock. (Too many laggers, this is huge problem, ping 120-250 = teleport, shots not regist = unplayable while you have ping 35, dying behind the corner/wall.

- Unstable server (ping 35 but feel lag)

- Server tickrate: 30 

- Drop FPS from 180 to 50 (Laptop i5+GTX 860m)

- Opening is a joke... I have spent 60€+ for BULLETS and get GOLD,MEDALS, BSCoin same sh*t as for the daily.

- Random errors , crashes...

16097,the game is basically cs:go on steroids (w/problems)

16099,"worst telemetry of any shooter around
unbalanced gameplay
full of cheaters
no bug ever gets repaired
p2w
retar ded community

this game is even worse due to their policy to work alongside with cheat makers and scam their customers like most fps makers do !!!"
16100,superb game
16101,"This game is, overall, very good. However, they need to impliment a system in which you can look up players you recently worked with so you can add them to your friends/block list.

The big problem is, however, the lack of a region lock. Gameplay is smooth up until the time period when the South and Central Amercian players log onto the N. American server. They tend to intentionally ruin your experience, have extremely high ping (which will affect your gameplay), or do both. The Asiatic players also tend to hack or use cheat mods, and a region lock would solve that problem as well.

Should they fix said two issues, this game would be more than worth your time.

EDIT: I posted this review in April of 2018. They STILL have yet to region lock the Asian region (where most of the hackers are), and they have yet to region lock Central and South American players (where most of the greifers are).

This game, again, COULD be good, if they would do so, but they will not do so. Play something else if you don't want an infuriating time."
16102,Amazing! Online! Multiplayer! First Person Shooter! EVERYTHING YOU COULD WANT IN A FPS! This is amazing its so good that im addicted to it now lol ive had it for 3 days now and I dont regret it so I recommend trying it!
16103,CounterStrike with Call of Duty
16104,"Good game, filled with players, not p2w and p2p, easy for beginners, so an excellent game for those who want free games."
16105,"Wow! One of the best games I've ever played and I still played only the first episode of this. That much is enough to see how fantastic this is. It's like watching a painted storyboard and the music is giving it a movie-like experience. The flow of the storyline depending on player choices is amazing and its not a rip-off of Remember Me even though the concept seems similar. I'd give a 9.5/10 just based on the first episode and totally worth buying all the episodes judging on how the first one turned out. Eargerly waiting for the next episodes.

Update (after finishing): Woah! that totallly blew my mind. Once again I have to say that this is a total masterpiece and the beauty of this game is the choices that are given to you which is truely unbiased and how the story flows with each decision. The endings are the most amazing endings ever on a video game which will surely surpass even some live action movies."
16106,"This game reminds me of Call Of Duty, more specifically Black Ops 2, without the killstreaks. Maps are a bit small and spawn locations dont switch. No local servers for South Africa yet. (If ever)"
16107,"Let's start by saying it's like  CSGO went an had a little brother that was faster, quicker, and looked a lot better than the older brother. It uses the unreal engine, it's pay to look good, and not pay to win. Basically everything you can buy with cash in terms of weapons, you can get by using in game gold which is quickly aquired anyways. The many game modes are fun as well. My only gripe is a shotgun should not be able to smoke you in 1 to 2 shots from across a map lol, it's not possible, but yet takes the smg and/or assault class not do the same thing. Also sniper guns are a bit over powered when able to use them and live on certain maps. But overall the game is awesome, and the community is pretty big, load times are pretty quick, and stays with events going on. If you like the game, come join my squad - Best F*in Krew - shoot me a message in game for an invite or something. Hope this helps and enjoy the game - dueces."
16108,Win to play no need to pay cause the aim will make the game
16109,Wow pretty good game especially for being free if you like csgo then you will love this game
16110,devs dont care about this game anymore.
16111,"If they had the proper funding they definitely would take over the FPS scene. 

Good to know there is a dev who can release a good classic game. 

Bueno!"
16112,"This is a pretty good game, its worth playing to see if you like it. But every game has problems and I just got out of a bad game so here we go.
What needs to be fixed, other than match making because that's a harder fix

    [*] Bigger maps: there are maps where you can throw a grenade from your spawn to the enemy spawn.
     
     [*]Spawn Healing: This is very needed, a box around where you spawn that PERMANATLY blocks damage or constant heal. This can stop  spawn camping. Possibly that turret from the trailer at the spawn so people can't spawn camp.
     
    [*] Multiple exits to the spawn: Some maps have this but the minimum should be 3. Maps with enclosed spawns that have 2 doors get spamed to hell.
    
    [*] Cheaper coasts: this is obvious, raise the rate of earning or lower the price of items.
     



My final note:
           [*]Pros:
 free, fun, graphic settings, fast respawns (thats a big one)
           [*]Cons:
 No chat, buying limited accses to wepons, match making, SPAWN CAMPING"
16113,Great game but it keeps making my computer crash
16114,"Shitty maps, Fun game"
16115,"very fun, movement feels strange but got used to it."
16116,The Dev team continues to make the servers better and better. The maps have outstanding designs (day and night theme). Keep it up!
16117,the best game !! the best gameplay !!
16118,"If you are a Call of duty player cum CS:GO player, you definitely gotta try this, Best action based and tactical based game, What else can you get for free :P"
16119,wish they had servers in INDIA or Nepal or China....
16120,After only 2 hours in the game ive came to the conclusion THIS IS THE NEW CSGO gameplay is fun No one trying to trade you some shit u dont want and most importantly  NO annoying 12 yr olds yelling into a mic with stupid shit that no one cares about. Hackers are dealt with and get there ASS handed to em  RIP CSGO
16121,"I really enjoy this game!

I started out with warface, at the time it was a enjoyable moment. That is until I tried out Black squad, I can now not play warface, its slow for me. Black squad is full of life.

Something I would love to see however is the addition of a report system because you sometimes meet hackers. A dude walk into a room, four people go down, ALL HEADSHOTS!

The other thing that really sucks is that when starting a match, you can be placed into a game thats some minutes away from ending and you get placed into a team thats so far behind. It sucks. It would be better if any game start actually joins in a game that has started not one that is finishing..."
16122,"It's really fun to play, but the running key is confusing. It should be shift or ctrl. The original run key is the scroll key on the mouse, but that also opens your knife.."
16123,i will not like even if it's year 2001
16124,"It's like combat arms, It's like Call of duty, It's like Counter Strike, Except It's not..."
16125,This was not my cup of tea...
16126,i love this game!!! now more because the update!
16127,Its amazing free2play shooter like cs:go + cod. Try to play. GLHF))!
16128,"Such a fun game. I like to just come on here to relax and kill, it gives a nice break from super competitive games such as csgo and overwatch. Although saying that i wish there was competitive gamemode that u didnt have to have a clan or join a clan match to play. Something like the csgo competitive matchmaking would be great. Overall 8/10 because usually games like these are pay to play/win whereas i was suprised that spending no money can still make you one of the best in the game."
16129,I mean.. meh
16130,I highly recommend this game. Worth playing!
16131,GOOD DAME
16132,"I'm in neutral right now because when i login my steam and play this game there was a message that my username and password needs to be checked i dont know why what was happened but this is the first time that it occured to me.

I uninstall the game and install the game again i hope this problem wont occur to me anymore if this problem still exist then i would say NO.

Since i cant post this review without clicking the Yes or No. Then my mind wont change."
16133,"Currently not a quality game. Netcode is awful, weapons are hopelessly unbalanced, and the maps have some serious design issues (lol a map where you can throw grenades from your spawn to the enemy spawn for ez spawnkills). This game is definitely not for anyone who favors skill over luck and cares about a fair game. Hopefully it can improve in the future, but for now I wouldn't even bother with it."
16134,"I do love this game that it's basic idea is to give people free access game to play in group. quality is great and weapons got real feeling to shoot. This is only game that I have played for a while, cause i do really love it. 
Also thing is that you can play it whit older computers too and it works, so it has been real generous to think those that got little.

Good work guys and thank you for this game.

Also Valofe has improved this game adding Arms race.

I look forward what they are about to do."

oh wait i have no friends :("

(i have like 65 Hours playing)"
16141,nice game but support should be important more and listen to people to successful
16142,"Everyone stop complaining about the ""Please Check your Username and Password"" If you were on their Discord you would know its a bug. They are fixing it so stop complaining and wait for them to fix the bug."
16143,It keeps saying check my username and password??
16144,Invalid password?
16145,"I don't write reviews for games at all, but I have to for this one.

Black Squad is a great game for friends to have a blast with, the only downside is if you actually have a good clan and you are killing everyone, your clan gets reported and banned, and we don't cheat in any way shape or form. So I lost all the money I put into the game, not worth spending any money whatsoever, buy the fire sales if you must. Don't spend money on it if they are just gonna ban you for no reason. I spend 61 hours in the game, and I'm written off and can't even launch the game, it closes it. So it's a good game, just don't play clan matches or you'll get bopped with the ban hammer."
16146,GOOOSHH!! what is happening?? Its says Wrong password and username [3][5][7000] How ??? is This a Maintenance????

16148,"A simple FPS, it does nothing badly enough to it hate, but gives nexxt to no level progression or rewards for playing after your first game. The only thing going for it is the same as many short battle FPS games... a quick game can be addictive and lead to users having just one more game.

16164,"First time i tryed the game i got insta-hooked and i managed to get a nade kill by chance on the first round and i don't get mad at me getting killed, The game feels like how it was with Hawken but without the crashes XD"
16165,New DLC please
16166,"Oddly enough, this game has helped me, a console player, transition from controller to m/k. The netcode on this game is absolutely fantastic. In just over 20 hours of playtime, I've not once felt like I've been cheated by lame hit detection or dsync issues. As someone who needs all of their shots to count, this was a huge selling point for me. Personally, I enjoy the dedicated spawns as it gives me an idea of where the enemy will be coming from. You can still flank and outmaneuver, but for the most part, it comes down to who has the best aim. No P2W here, as all guns can be purchased for either gold or medals. Both of which can be earned just by playing the game. You can buy weapons outright for real money, but from what I have seen, there is no gamebreaking weapon in the game. However, if you feel like there is a weapon that is constantly killing you and you currently don't have the means to purchase said weapon, you can download the 15 day DLC weapon packs for free and try out each gun, helping you to see which gun you should spend money on next. I mainly play TDM, and have noticed the maps to be quite small with multiple maps being set up like a paintball course (one room with obstacles spread throughout). Overall, I would say to give this game a try. I've never played CSGO, but this has got my interest up."
16167,dis jame is beri fani haha i rekomend it

16172,"No Australian Servers.
Full of hackers.
Extremely floaty controls
No skill required. Go around corners spraying and you will carry the team. 
Squatting and standing up constantly  makes you unbeatable.
Broken english in descriptions and even in recorded voice lines.

In short, this game is really meh, and would rather pay money for a good game then play this garbage."

What more you need !
PS:No P2W"
16174,fun.
16175,RIP DEAD GAME
16176,I love it great game! Definetly worth a try!
16177,Purchased some inventory items....using the in-game purchases.   They removed the items from game it appears...as they are not in my inventory anymore.   I'm talking about some cards.   Tried to contact support....its been a couple weeks and no response.   they might as well be stealing from the players......after they spend cash on in-game items.
16178,"This game... Is awful.

I don't understand how it's been rated so high, it's pay to win or grind until your ass is numb. Also all the girl player models only have one thing in common, bewbs. and all the good guns you have to pay for, aimbot is the #1 killer, I also can't see why you'd ever use the lazer sight it just makes you a target. getting AIDS would be better then playing this.

Also devs guess what... Your game wouldn't be fun even if it was balenced.

Now I'm going to play some Perfect Dark (N64) because it's free on PC.

Edit:

The main things that annoyed me is it's unbalenced, and all the guns I start with expire after X amount of days, this annoys me because I have other games I want to play, and after one match I didn't earn even close to enough of whatever the green currency is to replace anything. Also your UI in your menus is confusing.

Im sure if I had won that match (not that it was posible because of people with aimbot) that'd I would've gotten more ""points"" plus It's totally pay to win, sure you don't have to but why on earth would you want to grind for a gun? It's like when EA made people grind 40 hours for Darth Vader, that's not happening.
So that's my opinion, your game looks great. But I own Call of Duty games (because who hasn't bought one of them) and they are more fun atm then your game.

When I first saw this game I thought it would be a good alternitive to CoD but it isn't. And with only kids playing your game I guess that's not really something you have to worry about because kids are stupid."
16179,i would say is fun game you know reminds me of those old f2p korean fps i used to play as a kid notheless it could use a voice chat  atleast in the 5x5 matchs  but overall  i would say is fun game my dudes
16180,"Have no fucking clue how the reviews on this game are ""mostly positive""... It's a steaming pile of shit tbh."
16181,"[h1]Updated review after 1000+ hours of play-through.[/h1]

The player-base right now is nowhere as close as the time when I first started to play. This game is sadly, dying. It was on ""Early Access"" for way too long. Hackers are everywhere as the anti-cheat is literally not banning anyone after detection. Conspiracy related posts suggest that the game was from 2013, active cheaters are known to the developers, the support is quite bad & the development team is failing to maintain it all. The developers are known to abuse their moderation privileges on Steam - any negative thing about the game gets removed by them.

[h1]Game modes, game-play & interface[/h1]

This game has a lot of customization options. You can switch between a left-handed or a right-handed player model of all playable characters which is a bit unique. Crossair has lots of customization option as well. Overall interface is simple yet effective than most multiplayer games. There's only 2 musics which are horrible. There's two kinds of ""Radio"" message list available which basically plays audio commands to the whole team during matches. You have the option to write messages via chat to your team or to everyone in the match. Voice chat is only available in Competitive Match. You can block / unblock chats / voices at any time. Text chat features a messed up censoring system. It replaces tons of words & some alphabets in words with * but it can't tell the difference between a good word & an offensive word. It's improving with updates though.

It has so many game modes. The following 4 modes are basically the highlights: Team-Death-Match, Demolition, Assassination and Destruction.
Competitive mode is identical to the 5 vs 5 Demolition mode, except you get a rank. You can play solo, with a friend or a squad of 5 people, your rank will increase or decrease, depending on the outcome of the match.
There's a Custom Match channel that offers a ton of possibilities. Anyone can create and join custom matches of various types. You have the option to play with selected people by protecting the match with a password. This mode provides a lot of controls to the player & you can play against bots as well. Some game modes are exclusive to the Custom Match channel.
The Tournament Channel is only available to a handful of players, most people aren't authorized to enter. It's also worth mentioning that some experimental channels can sometimes be found on different servers.

All of the above mentioned game modes have several different maps which is really great, all maps are well made. All of the maps have numbered places on their mini-map, making it easier to communicate with teammates. However, you can find maps that were designed for Demolition modes with A, B, X & arrow pointers drawn on them in TDM matches which doesn't make sense.

The developers do introduce special occasion specific events / updates to the game which are unique & serve as a nice change of pace. This is quite interesting to say the least.

You can get small images as Spray & use them at any part of all the available maps. They'll last as long as that round & can be sprayed several times in a match. The Sprays are available through Lootboxes with the expiration date of 3 days. There are cosmetic backgrounds available to display behind your username. None of these give any advantages to anyone. [b]This game has almost no pay-to-win features.[/b] There are arguably only 3 pay-to-win weapons available right now..

The game-play isn't realistic but it's good enough for a free online game. Weapon damage, recoils and player movements are not at all realistic.

If you're looking for good graphics, this is not the game for you. Graphics could be improved a lot.

[h1]The big issue with BattlEye[/h1]

Their update to the Anti-Cheat system BattlEye is annoying me the most. I understand that the game has many hackers. But to counter that, BattlEye is 'hardware-banning' people & collecting [b]everyone's[/b] hardware information which includes several serial numbers of our PC setup. Even though they're saying that they only store these information of the people that get banned, they're still [b]collecting unique hardware information of [u]every player[/u] of this game.[/b]

I know that hardware-based bans will prevent hackers from creating a new account on the same PC & continue cheating but since BattlEye bans people based on statistics (resulting in false-positive bans which BattlEye is notorious for), these could have major side-effects. False-positive bans can happen to anyone & I don't know whether the developers can ""game-ban"" you on Steam or not but for a Free-To-Play game, this is too much in my opinion. I know BattlEye also monitors all running processes & any modifications to the game but that should be enough for an Anti-Cheat system. Running kernel driver is completely unnecessary.

If you get a hardware-based ban (false-positive or not), [b]BattlEye will not only permanently store your username but your PC configuration and their unique serial numbers as well.[/b] Basically, if you get a false-positive ban, your whole PC will be monitored by BattlEye, not just for this game or your Steam account but for all the games that uses BattlEye in all of your accounts on other gaming services like Steam. I think it's really risky to play a game with this kind of Anti-Cheat system.

The sad thing is, even with all these 'protections', BattlEye just kicks people from the match, it doesn't ban them. I've encountered people that were kicked by BattlEye in the previous match & playing again in a new match. In Competitive modes, they can just join back in after being kicked by BattlEye. The development team requires near-impossible proofs in order to take a report of cheating / hacking. To be honest, I don't think anyone's going to bother reporting players in this way. I suspect the cause of this is financial issues from the development team. To my knowledge, BattlEye can detect cheaters / hackers but need money from the developers to actually issue a ban.

[h1]Lootboxes, Currencies & Weapons[/h1]

There are 4-5 types of in-game currency, Golds, Medals, BS Coins & Bullets. It's quite confusing to be honest. You can only purchase Bullets using real money. Golds and Medals can be earned by playing matches & completing timed challenges. Lootboxes mostly contain throwable items. Sprays or skin version of weapons that you probably own already (without the skin) with expiration date of 1, 3 or 7 days. The balance in currency & the ways in which you earn them changes constantly with new updates.

There are 3 kinds of shops available in the game. One shop has all the weapons you can buy using Golds only. The other shop has slightly better weapons that can be purchased using Medals. The Random Box shop has 2 options, better Lootboxes needs to be purchased using Bullets which can be bought via Steam in-game purchases. And the other option is to buy a low grade Lootbox using Golds. Gold & Medal shops also offer unique premium stuff & cosmetic items that require purchase using Bullets.

Weapons that has a skin can only be purchased using 500 to 100000 BS Coins. But, BS Coins can be obtained by purchasing Lootboxes that require purchase using Bullets. 1 Lootbox that costs 80 Bullets can have several things in it, you'll most likely get throwable items with expiration dates but if you're really lucky, you can get a tiny amount of BS Coins. Now imagine what's going to take to gather 100000 BS Coins to get 1 weapon that has a good skin! Lootbox that can be purchased using Golds has a small chance of dropping 10 BS Coins.
The overall economical balance and maintenance are terrible.

The game has 3 kinds of throwable items which are: grenades, flashbangs & smoke-bombs. It has tons of weapons of various types - most of them are unbalanced, especially sniper rifles. Skins doesn't affect the weapon's stats in anyway.

[h1]I'll give it a 5 out of 10 at this moment.[/h1]"

16197,"This game embodies perfectly what was the must in the panorama of the free to play first person shooters in 2008

this game don't even attempt to add any kind of innovation, but bring back the most effortless and bare bone gameplay possible. This kind of game was an alternative for who wasn't able to purchase Counter Strike more than 10 years ago, but now you can take  it with a few bucks during the discounts"
16198,"I think that the game is pretty good and stable. It would be actually be pretty good if we could buy skins directly with real money. İf we could put other sights on guns, that would be really good."

16210,"Its honestly not the worst F2P FPS game out there. In terms of gun handling, it plays very much like CSGO (which I am complete trash at)

Honestly, the reason I like this game is due to the insanely high quality weapons. I don't think I've ever seen such quality when it comes to weapon skin design or just weapon design in general.
Its quite impressive.

I kinda wish more people would play... Or if bots weren't relegated to TDM.
Some advertising couldn't hurt this game tbh. More people should be aware of this game."
16211,"[b]Black Squad[/b] is bottom-line an above average first-person-shooter. It's use of crates/boxes as well as the multiple [i]shops[/i] in-game, and the daily rewards for logging in and completing ""tasks,"" is a great implementation. It rewards players' loyalty and you also receive rewards by just playing the first match of the day, which is very nice! 

Overall, [b]Black Squad[/b] is a great game in my mind. 9/10.

One suggestion would be to enable different soundtracks for the game...as the default one gets a little repetitive after awhile. That's all I've got to complain about lol.

16222,its pretty good
16223,"This game is very fast paced and ""simple,"" in a good way. The sounds and the graphics are nice, the gameplay is quick and satisfying and honestly, it's nice to play Team Death Match again. 

With all the Battle Royal and Overwatch styled objective shooters trending, it's nice to turn off your mind for a bit and just shoot people. It really brings me back to the reason I started playing shooting games in the first place. Just fast paced gameplay where all you need to worry about is killing and being killed. 

I like that you can get all the guns without spending any money, though if you want to look cool with a skin, you might have to shell out quite a bit. The drop rate in the loot crates is god awful at the moment, I'm hoping the chances get better to give us at least a little hope.

Also, not that important, but it would be cool to be able to make a few changes to your character model other than straight replacing it with acompletely different character. To get a little variety and personalization going.

It's nice to have the choice to mute team/all chat for when you really just don't want to hear any of it. It gives players the change to say what they want in chat without bothering people who dont wan't to be involved in trash talk/offended, since they can just perma mute chats.

Overall I have def. enjoyed the game so far and will continue playing long term most likely. Maybe one day I'll even be good at the game."
16224,"Naff. So ""arcade"" it's unbelievable, and the mouse movement is really slow."
16225,SUPER COOL GAME
16226,is good game best game
16227,Okay. I gave this game more of a chance and it's real fun. Offline bot mode when? No seriously this game would greatly benefit from it.
16228,"The game has really bad net code, the games always seem laggy. There doesn't seem to be any USA servers either in the North America region as my latency is always high on those servers. I'm talking start at Alaska and go to Florida high latency.

People just appear out of nowhere, people shoot you through unshootable cover, it just seems like there's tons of hackers.

Gun physics are really far off from their real world counterparts. Iron sights are useless unless you have a scoped weapon. The guns all have holo/red dot/etc. sights, but it is like your character just opened the box and mounted them without ever taking time to zero them in. This might be related to the bad gun physics.

The maps are way too small, and the hitboxes on objects end up getting you stuck just for brushing against them. Another issue with the really small maps is that there is no easy way for non-group players to counter spawn camping. All the spawn points are out in the open, and after you're done being blue, all they have to do is pull the trigger on your head.

Honestly, there are other better F2P shooters on the market. The game says early access, but there is no easy way for the developers to fix all the issues in this game without rewriting significant portions of core code."
16229,"Its a great game, very smooth, you should definitely try it out. Easy to get into, thicc anime chicks (but they cost cash), very good. Plus it's free. Just try it. Tac reload."

16258,makes me cum
16259,"Honestly?
Just another generic f2p shooter.
Nothing really good nothing really bad.
Sound design is terrible my ears hurt when i play this game all silenced/suppressed weapons use the same one generic audio file.
Gunfire sounds as if someone was recording other guy banging a metal bucket.
Pull out knife to run faster... yeah...
Gunplay: you can zoom in with any weapon but it doesn't make any difference all the guns have its pattern and even if you zoom/scope in after 3 shots your bullets just go straight out of your scope.
You can put silencer/suppressor on almost every gun (mostly assault rifles) and turn on laser I guess it has minor influence on your weapons but doesn's seem to be anything significant.
UI Is just terrible, hard to read, dark unintuitive.
It's an old game after an overhaul the roots of this game reach back to 2013
Daily/weekly/monthly quests with rewards helping you unlock new guns
There are gun skins but nothing really impressive just some average art style sometimes looks like they hired some cheap artist. Altough i must admit that most weapon models, characters aswell as animations are pretty good.
There Are like 4 in game currencies that really confuse me what is what.
You are gonna have as much fun as if you would in any other f2p fps.
Game is not really recommendable from my point of view.

Edit:
I forgot to mention few minor things:
Minimap - Great minimap especially when you try to communicate with teammates where enemies are. What they did is that they divided minimap to few segments and gave numbers to each of the segments.
What is the greatest option in this game is possibility to turn off text chat. Just turn off the chat and no salty team mates, isn't that great? I'd like to see feature like that in more games.
Voice acting is ""meh"" it gets annoying after a while but you can turn off voices either.
Graphics don't look bad and The level design is quite decent

[b]The worst experience in this game are those weird short freezes and i honestly don't know what's the reason they happen. I don't think it's my pc (i7 processor 16g ram game installed on a SSD 3gb graphic card) but that is definitely the worst thing about this game.[/b]"
16260,"You want to have fun with your pals, in a FPS?
This is the game you want.
But if you are a solo player, I wouldn't recommend it.
Game has poor mechanics but, poor matchmaking, it has microtranscations,
It has everything you would hate in a competitive game.
But it's free, right? 
So if you are 5 guys just download it and have fun.

16288,"Ever since Valofe has taken over the game, the game has gone s h1t.
They have destroyed good guns and snipers by rebalancing the weapons and introducing jackets. Ever seen a game where the snipers do 90 damage on the torso? The game rewards players who spray with 0 aim.

It was a Korean game from the start but the new policies are destroying the experience of the players from the rest of the world, Eg. removing the steam market. Guns which would sell for 5$ on the market now comes from the opening boxes. It's pure gambling. 

They have completely changed the mechanics in a desperate attempt to keep the players hooked. All the skins are temporary. The last attempt to keep the players was handing out western skins. The anniversary skins were temporary. 
 
Also what made the game fun was the chat system. Players would troll each other and mostly things were good and harmless. Valofe banned the global chat from a lot of game modes(destruction, Tdm, 5 vs 5 etc) in order to keep the c r y babies happy. It was a lame attempt to keep toxic players out. By default rooms have chat blocked. Words like ""game"" are censored. Mic has been removed from 5 vs 5. This is detrimental to the growth of community. 

$ hit ping players are not kicked from the game, its common to see players with 300 ping to have the most kills. Earlier they had a system to automatically kick high pingers and now they have removed it because pingers and bots are 50% of the games base. American servers are dead, most servers are 90% pingers. By pingers I mean players with 200+ ping. No regs are a huge part of this game. If you play any other game, you will feel the difference instantly. 

The game was fun earlier, but now 90% of your time is frustrating. Players try to crave the pleasure they used to get earlier.

If you are looking to play a competitive game, play something else. This game is being milked hard and they will keep milking it because the players loved the old bs, but now it has been taken over by a greedy company."

16296,best fps multiplayer game even it can run on very low wnd pc with good quality game is awesome and it has many types of game modes like capture deathmatch and list goes on.....once youb play you will be addicted to this game.
16297,Superb !
16298,"Really good game, very fun and has a wide variety of maps and weapons, all though, some things could be better, for example, it has a clunky menu, it is easily to locate things but still, it woould be better if it was a little more simple, a;so it has a complex in game currency, there are four different kinds, and it could be better if there was only one or two. Another thing is that you can open crates and they will give you weapon reskins and things of the sort, this isnt so bad but most of them have a timer on them which indicates how long you can have them for before they get deleted from your account, this is the most annoying part of this game, and would be better off removed, give us the skin, or not. It is also a cliche thing in gmaes that use a third party system to run the game, which is a stupid idea. Overall though, the game is great."
16299,"I'm in love with this game.
What I lovo about it: 
-Free to play
-good graphics
-a lot of weapons
-it is not hard to get coins
-awesome gameplay, cant get enough of it
-community is also great
-the only game where I will be able to get a Karambit xDD
-you dont need a strong PC to run it (toaster will be fine)
-I really like the gameplay
-

What I would like to change :
-Team voice chat.
-definatelly better sound system for footsteps and stuff (I really use the sounds around me, sometimes I can hear footsteps but noone is there)
-more skins
-different gun designs (to me, most of them sound the same)
- myb a red dot design system for your gun, at least the symbol, i like some guns, but cant stand the reddot :)"
16300,"Very Cool Game.
Here are what i see as the pros and cons of this game as well as some things they should add.

Pros: 
Doesn't demand very much from your PC
Graphics aren't terrible
Tons of guns
Nice player base
Clans
'Competitive'
Private Rooms
Very fulfilling noises when you get headshots or kill someone. XD

Cons:
Barely anyone plays Clan matches 'competitive'


What they could add to make the game better:
1. Modes:
Gun Game
FFA
Pistol Only
Pistol Survival
A Mode where you can pick one weapon that everyone has to use such as say Tomohawk only
2. Guns
Add more shotguns, as it is there are only 2
Possibly something similar to AA12 or maybe Spas-12, there's also Remington
Maybe some more pistols as well
3. Classes
You need to face the facts three classes is simply not enough, maybe up it to 5 or 6 because it's nice to have one class for every type of weapon.
4. A report button
5. Clans
Maybe some kind of upgrade menu or something just to make it more interesting.
6. Final Kill Cam and Personal Kill Cams"
16301,It’s a very fun game for what it is
16302,needs australian server
16303,"I realy like this game... but it could use some updates. I would like to see a new feture added such as being able so lean side to side, or having more explosives. But my biggest problem that I have is that you dont get alot of the stuff for permanent whith may be the reason im going to stop playing. All im saying is to update more and make some changed."
16304,wahh
16305,"it's a pretty fun game, kind of like cs-go and cod mixed with a few other things
"
16306,"DO NOT PLAY 'EARLY ACCESS' - wait until the game is finished (if ever).

Gameplay is great, but constant server disconnections are just unbearable."
16307,"Ex-A.V.A player for 8-9 yrs
just played a half hour I'm not sure the hackers problem
feels like nothing change about the sniper. just seems ok
===============
pros
no more pay to win like AVA
better graphic optimization
a bit better graphic quality
better controlling
GUI is clear and easy to understand
================
cons
the weapon recoil and RNG are awful (AR&SMG) especially the AR, it had almost no recoil but the RNG... Kappa
the laser is unnecessary
there has a same problem with ava that the fps drop when enemy appear, I cant find the reason and I had same problem with AMD and Nvidia graphic card
=============================
LAST ONE
PLEASE DO NOT USE GOOGLE TRANSLATE IN TRADITIONAL CHINESE VERSION (omfg)

reason to dislike
1. translate (important because some words like a joke)
2. recoil and RNG system
3. Not realistic, just between modern and future. Not enough distinct
expect the update"
16308,/.;
16309,"Funny game )))
 yeah really fun"
16310,No
16311,Servers suck.
16312,"Okay so where do I start hmmmm... Oh yea If you are into spamming nades and dying out of luck because some guy ran towards you and sprayed you down well yea go for it, If not play cs go or warface"
16313,Dislike for not ban hack. Too much hack onehead. Follow hacker.
16314,"Dont usually post reviews, but I really recomend this game. Its only a beta and doesnt have a lot of maps or weapon load outs  at the moment  but a fun game to play . Get in there before it starts getting spoilt by M/Fs"
16315,"Not as good as it looks.
The audio in the game sucks.
U can say its a legal copy of csgo but not that good..."
16316,Best FPS Game Ever !!! :3
16317,"way too many grenades, would be better if it weren't modern warfare 2 noob tube battles on steroids."
16318,"nice game,f2p not a pay to win"
16319,""" good fps "" "" Basicly gameplay """
16320,Holy Sh*t this game sucks. Its servers are shit. It breks your computer every 10 seconds. Dont play this buy something. There is a reason this game is free.
16321,"Ok so, i need to say this game is just so good for a free to play. Most free to plays they make you have to buy things to win and in this game everything is unlockable and purchasable. You can but the best weapons with cash or earn them easily in 5 rounds. The only thing that cost real cash are crates and crates contain different skins for knives and guns. Skins dont make you better. So this game isent pay to win at all. Theres some competitive in it although this game isent based on realisim. The physics are nice and smooth and the game is very fast paced. Graphics are very well done and the effects are nice as well. 10 minites in and you will be hooked and playing all night."
16322,its F2P P2W CSGO what more could you ask for?
16323,fun game definitely free.
16324,"Such a neatly layed out game and the gameplay, very nice. 
Graphics aren't bad............."
16325,"This game realy need a REPORT function and a way of muting players !!

When you have to play with little kids that think its funny to spread racist and nazi shit all the time it can get very anoying."
16326,Love the combat in this game. Very entertaining.
16327,"Yeah, good game deffinetly not a pay to win for me cause i got a a karambit for 2 days ^^ Verry fun and good to play with friends ^^"
16328,"this game is just the best free to play game i can find on steam.
what i like about this game:
1. you can buy skins if u want
2. 5 modes 
3. custom matches with friends or other players
4. less hackers then u think
5. clans
6. its just CS:GO but then with better graphics and you dont have to buy this game"
16329,nice
16330,"Best f2p game i have played.
"
16331,"Fun game , only played like 1 or 2 matches but it gets a A+ from me"
16332,♥
16333,"i'd like to spend my whole life for this game xD
Pros :
-Unreal Engine 3 bois,, Good graphics for low spec m8
-Compareable with CS:GO
-has better community than CS:GO
+Short Pace game
-Free xDxD

Cons:
-F****ckin CHEATERS M8
-The community still toxic"
16334,nice game i like this game so much
16335,"Game really fun to play, and you can play with it with a  bad pc. The People who are just hating on the game are the people who only have prob 5 hours played maybe even less"
16336,Game keeps crashing when i load into it help
16337,If you like playing with the same 10 people and also hackers this game is for you.
16338,love it
16339,spawn campers gallore and not to mention my entire inventory was wiped the other day aside from the basic weapons.
16340,Best Game NA
16341,"I cant stop playing help me.

edit 2021: They have made an update like a year ago and u cannot play in your region anymore. Only 30 seconds and you are put in expand search which end u in a 150ms game. Devs legit killed their game and they dont care. But sure, keep putting new skin boxes like we care..."
16342,Hmm..
16343,"+
F2p cs-style game with player avaliable 24/7
Not many cheater compare to other similar game

-
Limited content/customization"
16344,Aiming?? What's that?
16345,Spawn Camps and Grenades
16346,total garbage
16347,"They claim it's not a pay-to-win, F2P, FPS; In all reality, it is. You gotta spend hundreds of dollars for the currency ""Bullets"" to get the more 'one-shot' kill guns. And the loot-box system is so annoying, especially when you get rewarded shit only to have an expiration date on it. That spells pay-to-win on sooo many different levels. The maps are mediocre. They feel like micro versions of CoD maps. Also, the guns are a bit too unrealistic, from the recoil to the reload speeds. On the topic of weapons, have a designated melae button, so having close quarter combat can be fast paced. Allthogh this game isn't the perfect game on Steam (that'll be TF2), I do recommend this game to anyone who wants a FPS shooter for their Steam Library. It has a fun multiplayer and a loving fanbase. And great work on the Battleye, that shit works. I rate this game, 8.5/10 Black Squad intros."
16348,its actually a pretty decent good free game.
16349,"For a F2P game, its honestly great, the gameplay and mechanics work great and it just feel nice.

i HIGHLY recommend picking this up."
16350,its kinda fun i would say  i highly recommend this game
16351,"Its just awesome and runs so good on my low specs pc sound of headshots,fatalshots just adds charm to this game but its fuzzy behavior makes it very hard to win and also match take really long times to start sometimes 5 minutes which is annoying and also its automatch making sucks."
16352,"For free games, it is great, recommend everyone to play this game"
16353,"For a free to play, its not too bad. Easy to pick up all the controls and I love the Assasinate game mode, something new I have never played. Only bad point is you have to save money to buy guns, and some you have to buy with medals. Although you can get medals through ranking up and logging on, it can take a while to save enough for a gun, which you may not even like once you get it."
16354,"good game , bad support."
16355,its 2018 you cant just put black in the title and expect no one to react
16356,"My honest reivew:

1) No Australian servers means bad game for me :(

2) Its broken with its weak SMGS and its bland style of game play

3) its a f2p first person shooter meaning there was no difference to many other f2p shooters 







My score: 4/10 could add new servers and maybe more intresting gameplay"
16357,JUST NO BUNCH OF QUICK SCOPING
16358,"Let's start with the negatives to get those out of the way. 
1. Server lag, sometimes it's low and sometimes it is down right monstrous. This game holds my record for highest latency with over 18,000 ms on one occasion. 
2. Guns can sometimes feel unbalanced but that is the way it is when you are still learning how to play, the selection can also feel small when you find yourself playing with the same guns over and over but the number of multi-day rental guns makes up for this. 
3. Gun prices can be high and hard to reach leading to a grind and if you happen to be like me and you can be outmatched by bot thats run on a toaster then it does get a little annoying when you compare prices each day and find yourself only a little bit closer to that shiny new gun.

The Pros: 
1. The gameplay is fast and very fluid and I think that is helped by the low respawn time. Leaving me with barely a moment to glance at my phone before throwing me back into the game. 
2. Now, I've played nothing but TDM because I don't like waiting for matches and I enjoy the small maps. In other games a TDM map can too big and it feels cumbersome to get from one place to another but in Black Squad the maps are small, with multiple levels and plenty of thin corridors. 
3. What, I really like over other online FPS games is that there is no labor in getting a suppressor for your gun and by extension no special status for players who happen to have them. It's simply given to you and that is that. The loss of a special value for suppressors really makes it less irritating to play against them.
4. It's fun, what more do you want me to say. I enjoy the gameplay and am prepared to recommend to my friends.

Now, some changes that I would like to see.
1. As mentioned before, the guns feel a little lacking and some offering some more secondary guns on the common shop would make me more inclined to use mine.
2. Some more maps would be nice, don't get me wrong here, the ones we have are awesome and fun to play on but some variety is always welcome. 
3. Weapon modifications, now this is a point that even I am hesitant to say should be a thing, being able to personalize a gun to suit personal tastes is always nice and being able to fit different scopes and sights to a gun is useful. But this might be a bit too much for the game right now.


TL:DR 
It's a fun game with some flaws but that is to be expected. Play if you're looking for fast gameplay."
16359,best fps
16360,One of the best free to play games.
16361,It's a great multiplayer shooter game
16362,i highly recommend this game. its just free and better version of cs go . love it <3
16363,"Brilliant game. I wish I knew about it sooner. 
Honestly, I've never had so much fun with an FPS game before, everything about this game just feels great, recoil doesn't feel as bad as in other games, getting a kill feels amazing with all the sounds and effects, the graphics are gorgeous and players are actually rewarded by playing.
As long as the developers don't get greedy and take combat arm's path, this game WILL succeed.
Release ranks, pay some streamers to play the game (Shroud did a great job on passing a good image about it) and this game will be big in no time.
Also, weapon skins are amazing in this game, they look great, better than CS:GO's skins to be honest, but please be careful with character models. Female characters have a smaller hitboxes and that is unacceptable on a future competitive scene.
"
16364,Poor mans RNG FPS.
16365,best f2p game 4 sure m8
16366,"This has to be the worst POS game I have ever witnessed. Game isn't balanced at all. You can use items like auto turrets that are so strong they can down you before you can get a few shots off. They take multiple mags just to stun them and by the time their timers are up, you can just put another one down. There are hackers everywhere but no way to report people in game. Do NOT waste your time or money with this game or company. They will just take your money and not do anything to improve it."
16367,"AWESOME
"
16368,One of the best free to play games on steam at the moment. Very quickly turned into my everyday game
16369,its good
16370,this game is intense. i first started and went on the tutorial and was like the controls are sticky and the guns are unrealistic but then i was able to change my control settings and was like woah i joined a multiplayer server and had the most fun is ages....i love this game but sometimes i feel like the servers are really mad with everything that goes on at once....great game thou you should try.
16371,"Nice game to try XD !!!
haha"
16372,"Severs suck balls, i can't do anything"
16373,good game
16374,Good Game.... Fast Paced FPS game similar to old days blackshot and sudden attack. weekly and monthly online competitions available.. not a pay to win game. try it !

16377,reminds me of csgo. it is so fun and addictive even though i spent barely any time on it i liked what i did play. this is literally a free version of csgo but not the same gamemodes. i think the graphics are very hd and the gameplay overall is just fun and you want to keep coming back. I recommend this 6/10.
16378,"This game is garbage, The developers allow snipers to be a 1 hit kill, plus you can play to win in this game as well. The balancing is non existant. Do NOT download this game."
16379,"Good game. Especially that it's free. Not Pay2Win at all, friendly people and fun to play in general. Recommended"
16380,"Playerbase is trash and is no help at all. You'll have to figure out everything on your own because NO ONE WILL HELP YOU. Spent around 4 matches trying to find a player that will tell me how to use a grenade launcher on the weapon and not one would help, they are all trolls. The game itself is alright but is the exact same as every other free to play shooter. Don't have high expectations because you will be destroyed by people who are paying to win."
16381,osm game
16382,Not a P2W game very good for poor CS GO gamers the graphic not too bad (the graphic actually not important for this game) this game Graphic just like CS GO and the gameplay very awesome for a free to play gam on steam
16383,"Not for me, there are better FPS out there."
16384,"Fun game, can get a little grindy at times, but its a good game overall. (More people will make the game more fun though)"
16385,"Overall this is a really fun free-to-play shooter with earnable cosmetics & weapons. Also, you shouldn't believe these reviews with 2 hours or less of play time claiming there's rampant hacking in this game. There's not. There are really good players in this game for sure, but if you don't play first-person shooters, go 2/0/22 a game, and spray at people's feet with an SMG at 40 yrds. away then you shouldn't assume someone is cheating because they headshotted you. 8/10 give it a shot if you're a fan of other shooters and want to try something familiar, but with its own charm.

Pros:
-Free to play
-Starting weapons are plenty viable and you can earn the rest of them fairly quickly.
-Maps are built in a way so you don't have to roam around forever to find an enemy.
-Gunplay feels responsive and rewarding (headshots/accuracy matter).

Cons:
-Maps are fairly small so this can lead to grenade spam in TDM. However, grenades themselves don't have ridiculous explosive radiuses and the further away you are the less damage it'll do.
-Teambalance can sometimes stack you against really good players while leaving you with not so good players to carry.
"
16386,It's crap
16387,"I dont like this game, when i played it, i thought it looked amazing. And then i realised how unfair was the A.I when i was just beggining to play.  
Then one time my game crashed, i reloaded the game and the screen was fucked. i tried fixing it but it didint work. Is it my pc or the game."
16388,It was an honor  to play this game. I got bored of the sketchiness after 36 minutes.
16389,One of the highest quality free games you can play on pc.
16390,Awesome Game! Really
16391,"Absolutely pay to win. 
Pay to unlock higher damage weapons = pay to win."
16392,"this game is beyond bad, why would anyone play, only hackers who get like 200 kills on 15 min game, clearly a pay-to-win game, no chance at getting new items through playing, would take 30 days atleast to be able to afford new gun, or pay 10 dollars a piece to get one for limited time.

UPDATE: I can see why people enjoy this, its quite fun with wall hack and aim bot actually XD"
16393,wew
16394,really good game to play good FPS in it i recommend it people
16395,"Fixx the game pls. Since yesterday i cant play!

16396,A truly awesome game even if it has been around for 4 years in Early Access.
16397,Le Bewbs Le Jiggles
16398,"I mean...its good. Guns are pretty cool looking. Gameplay isn't that bad, its a COD inspired game, prepare for campers."
16399,"I was looking for a good first person shooter, this wasn't it. Controls suck..."
16400,"Kinda bad but alot of games are bad so it looks mediocre but its f2p so what would you expect
"
16401,yes
16402,You shoot people
16403,cod is even better
16404,iTS A REALLY GOOD GAME
16405,Had fun without taking the game too seriously
16406,"Not really seeing how this is so highly reviewed. Firstly, your character moves like a tank. Sprinting very slowly is your default speed. Hitting shift only slows you down to ""walk"". I only played this game for all of like 3 minutes, and that was all it took to inform my decision of this game. With as many FPS as there are, and as many as I have played, you know when things are off. One big thing that hit me in the face is that I could watch my enemy spawn in. Sure, there is temporary invincibility on spawn, but I could legit just sit there and watch it happen, and no matter how far i pressed in the spawn never bothered to change. Not a good sign. Decent spawn mechanics in a competitive FPS are a must. So no I can not recommend the game as it is now. This game could get better and I might be back on that day, but as of right now it is getting an uninstall pronto"
16407,"Yknow, this game is actually not that bad, the servers are great too. 
When It's working."
16408,"This game needs to be updated more frequently, it has been pretty boring in my opinion."
16409,"If anyone asks you for any decent [b]free-to-play[/b] fps games, include [i]Black Squad[/i] to that list. Believe me, you won't be lying. And if you're not that into the aesthetics, but more with the diversity of weapons then you won't have any problem enjoying this game because the game's rewards system will enable you to purchase them without spending real money. And with the round-the-clock anti-cheat system, the developers ensure you that they are doing their best to make every game you play, a fair one."
16410,This game is awesome but the problem is i hope i can use mic to communicate with other people online and gun can be drop so that we can swap with my friends
16411,"Well made game, really fun and its free!!

Better then CSGO

8/10"
16412,Графика такая себе. Игра не очем
16413,"I enjoy playing black squad.

You can think of this game as a CSGO and Call Of Duty Online.

The game has many features
-Casual and Comp gameplay (more later)
-Clans and clan matches (more later)
-Balanced gameplay
-ESports connection (more later)
-In game shop (more later)
-not pay to win
-Great Stat management
-Missions and Challenges
-Daily rewards
-Decent amout of maps per gamemode 
-did i mention its FREE
-gameplay is free
-guns in both stores are free

The Casual gameplay contains modes of
TDM
5v5 and 8v8 Assasination, and just like csgo CTs vs Terrorists
Battle match (lot of fun)

These in casual are great places to get started when learning the game. At this point of the game alot of people are good but if you meet the right people and hours of gametime you will become ESports ready lke me.

The same gamemodes apply to Comp and Clan matches. except battle match. I havent played alot of comp but i have played alot of clan. Its a place where sweaty people go. 


The in game shop is very VERY NOT pay to win at all. all guns purchased are bought with credist that are earnable from just playing the game. IF you want SKINS you might have to pay alittle bit. but they do not affect gameplay at all. 

ESPORTS is beginning to rise and take place in Black squad. I am in a discord called Pheonix league and you can compete for Cash prizes and clan tournaments for fun if you want. Which are streamed and posted on a PRO level.

Possible Improvements
-Removal of grenades in TDM
-Removal of Grenade launchers (noob tubes)
-no more one sided maps"
16414,Never found a game with players in it.
16415,So much fun

keep getting disconnected ty to the high ping thing."
16418,"Just jump around and have fast reflexes, camping and going tactical will get you nowhere... I just crouch and a guy just jumps and flies in the air killing me, nah... This game is call of duty but more fast paced... When you first start off you have bad guns so you have to take the guns off dead enemies to be good like them"
16419,Great game! Reminds me of the old times when Combat Arms used to be good. The engine is great and gameplay is very smooth.

16425,love this game
16426,"Calling this any sort of a ""version of CS:GO"" is truly insulting to CS:GO. The movement is clunky, the shooting is laughable, the enemy players literally have a healbar that pops up.... it is fucking dogshit and I don't even care that it was free, it is worth leaving a review if I save even one other veteran FPS player from wasting their time with this game.

The only way this would possibly appeal to you is if you are just first getting into the FPS genre and/or are a kid. Otherwise, you are really just gonna see right through this.... and most genre newbies and kids will see right through it anyway. Hard pass."
16427,its a real shame cuz the guns feel really good but the maps are kinda shit.
16428,Better than most FPS games out there
16429,You can do a couple more things then in cs:go but it's a rip off csgo
16430,Good game... But not enogh player in game... and also it is like pay to win.. u can't afford good guns without money or enogh time.
16431,Worse than CS:GO
16432,"great game, needs more support from people"
16433,"shit game, hackers everywhere. still report button is invisible"
16434,Cheap and primitive shooter with the simplest mechanics. Bad interface and that's it. It was fun for first two mins and nothing to do more there.
16435,it's great :)
16436,"At First glance i though this was a cs go clone , but i played it and bought the founders pack too Very intersting to see what the devs planned in the future for this game ;D"
16437,"Great Game, Need a Oceanic server for Australia and New Zealand."
16438,"This game is actually really good.It lags me sometimes out of the game,but not always and the standard weapons are nothing against the others but I still enjoyed it."
16439,"This game is a lot of fun to play alone and with friends. I feel like there are definitely things that could be added, like a voice chat and better match making system. Also getting rid of hackers would be great lol. But other than that it's super fun c:"
16440,"like

16441,"Hi, kids! Do ya like hackers?!

*kids* ""YEEEAAAH!!!""

Well then do I have the game for you!

*kids cheer*

UNINSTALLED."
16442,"Postives:
-This game is really not bad for a free game

-It sort of almost feels like an improved version of CS:GO

- A nice variey of games

-Graphics are really good

-A good variety of guns

Negatives:

-Actually dont see something negative about it

Conclusion:
- I would recommend this game if u dont want to pay a lot of money on cod game and stuff like that and I believe that u would enjoy it"
16443,"They hired a 3year old kid for auto balance. Expect also to join in a middle of a game just to loose. Hackers are everywhere in this game, the system will only kick the hackers and not banned them. Why not kick the hacker and remove their kills and deaths in that game/"

16445,Nice game but matchmaking is not good.
16446,"It's definitely fun. A nice kick back casual game. If you enjoy CS or COD the sniping feels very similar to the scout or the intervention. The weapons feel heavy and sound chunky which I love.
I usually play the TDM mode, which has an instant respawn. Its the first team to 150 kills. Super laid back. Good way to practice your shooting skills.
The other game modes are fun too. Haven't run into any toxic players either which is nice. 
**My negatives are the fact you have to buy grenades to add to your inventory everyday, which.. yes is trivial but silly.
**The homescreen interface can be a bit confusing for new players.. 
Other than that. Great game.

P.S. Aim for the head."
16447,No money to play a good FPS?Then tihs game is here to satisfy you!
16448,"this game is good and the hacker amount is droping but there are so many TOXIC and MEAN people,(3xheroin, yeigrth, etc)
those players were the most toxic when i was playing today. i hope they get something for being so mean to me and others. they started saying ""leave, you suck"" and all kinda mean leave things. i hope all the toxic players will stop there bullSHlT and start to be nice. i recommend this game because its fun and has good gameplay BUT all the toxic people in this game will ruin it. i hope the creators will understand that the toxic people are bigger issue than the hackers


ps> we need a hide n seek and get ride of these 2 players i talked about(3xheroin and yeigrth). they were SUPER mean to other players too.

-lekomn"
16449,"The perfect game for getting shot in the back constantly, spawning in the same place and getting shot in the back again, then spawning in a house and getting sniped through the wall, then dying to a random airstrike. Theres no matchmaking system whatsoever so you in your first match you will get matched with the freaks who dedicate their lives to this game. Utter garbage really"
16450,nice graphics for a free game
16451,"Great game!
 Well balanced and fun fast paced gunplay! You can play this like a call of duty death match where you die every few seconds and respawn get a chain of kills and die ect. But there is also Demolition mode and Survival, basically one life per round so it has a very tactical aspect to it as well.
 
As a veteran of CS Source I can say this game fills that competive need, without runing my time urging me to buy items.
Guns are balanced and you are given a health amount of starting money to buy the one you like..
Havent seen a Hacker yet like people say, im actually usaully at top of leaderboard.

Also the matches come close always really close games.

 Download it you have nothing to lose.

if i had to name cons its just that it takes a bit of a grind to unlock things as a free player. but still fun none the less."
16452,toxic community
16453,"I downloaded this game ,being new to PC gaming, to get better at aiming and shooting with keyboard and mouse. Considering the game is free to play it is very impressive and a great way to get into PC gaming. The game itself is actually very good and I will continue to play it."

If you deeply love this game like me, don't forget to help out the developers and the team by purchasing the founder's package, not only you are supporting to develop the game, but you also get exclusive stuff that wont be available later!
It's still on Early Access so it is worth a shot to fund and support the game developers.

Thank you for checking out my review, i hope i gave you an heads up about what to expect and i hope i helped anyone with this review.

Also fun fact and offtopic, if you don't know who shroud is, he is a former professional CS:GO player for the Cloud9 team, and he did play this game.

16456,"This game is better then line of sight! good DLC packs! very good action! good guns! its playable and its not a Pay to win game!

Edit: when i try to start up the game i only get white screen!"
16457,Its very good I rate 9/11
16458,good game
16459,"such a good game
"
16460,"this game is awesome, definitely recommend"
16461,Black squad like csgo and css
16462,"Positive factors (description):

Get the game. It isn't a big game, grahics are good, and runs at pretty good frame rate! The game is half realistic shooter and half arcade shooter are it puts you in the feild as an operator and it also has great gun mechanics, but the overall essence of getting kills within the game and ""wacky"" body physics make it feel like an arcade shooter. There is no need to become super competivie with this game and it is a great game if you like certain aspects of COD. It's more of a ""laid back"" ""fast pased"" shooter and really fun. Getting a kill in the game is super satisfying and addicting. Im being bural from my writing above, but I hate flowering a game without telling the truth. Anyway, it has daily log-in (which isnt really daily ;), and the rewards are great) which always makes it enjoyable to comeback to the game. The guns also feel smooth and always fun to mess around. Has decent gernade physics

Issues or Downsides (discription):

It's 100% F2P but not really when it comes to cosmetics. I for one dislike paying for cosmetics with a ""sepcial"" currency. You know how every game has ""gems"" or ""gold"" or something that is currency for a sepcial store within the game... well yeah, this one has that too. Besides that, there are guns that are wildly stronger than others. Sometimes their ""nerf"" dosent do enough to help balance the weapon. Yet within the lobby it might take you a few hours before you can determin which guns to use and which not to use. But with a good team with variety of weapons  (and competence) a match won't feel unbalanced. Maps on one hand are fun and thought out, they lack numbers. For some gamemodes, you might be lucky to be stuck with the same map because there isnt a way to vote for maps, and there are only a handfull for some gamemodes.  BTW for those who want to know there is no mic support. There is also only two songs for the menu and they get pretty boring... The game has decent gernade physics but they are sometimes an a55 to throw, but the body physics are stupidly ridiculous.

Possible Improvments / Ideas :
- Map Vote 
- Balancing the Weapons and adding weapon ""rivals""
- Adding (more) fresh maps 
- FIx the prices for everything
- Focus more on more frequent updates
   - If Devs run out of ideas, make in-game surveys to get the community involved
- Add an in game market where people can tade/sell/buy weapons and skins
   - Connect with the Steam Marketplace and add value to weapons/skins/kinfes
- Add workshop support for the community to submit skin ideas.
   - or a drop box in-game so the community doesnt have to work double to submit ideas
-Patch and add more frequent updates
  - (I know i already mentioned this)
  - Work to get this game out of early acsess
- Add more/better gun customization
- Add more than two songs

16463,"If your looking for a good FPS, then this is it! I've been playing for quite awhile, and its a really good game! The only thing is tho, is in the description, it says ""Absolutely no Pay-to-Win."" While that is mostly true, if you want to get past rank 3, then you need to spend at least a few $. Other than that, I definitly recommend this game! 4.7/5"
16464,is it just me or a lot of dc?

16469,Really good game but make sure you choose carefully around which gun you buy as they cost a fare amount of gold.
16470,"
'' Black Squad '' is a classic shooting game based on getting to victory with your team standing.
I recommend it because:
♠ It does not weigh much.
♠ It is a free and comfortable game at the same time.
♠ It is a game for people with few economic resources xD. It's a joke.
And nothing more than to say that they enjoy it and thank you for being free.
@KeistoN"
16471,cool
16472,"A few things I love about this game, It's not another pay to win FPS game that you normally see on steam. The reloading animations are exquisite and they make me love the game even more then I already do. If you like fast paced shooters based around war, this game is definitely a must get! 9.5/10"
16473,"you guys need to deal with those cheaters, fucking scumbags. However, this game is okay."
16474,Alot of hackers
16475,"After 12 hours, my honest review of this game:

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
*Free to Play
*Not paid to win
*Multiple game modes (Destruction mode is my favorite)
*Fair range of weapons variety, doesnt take too long to buy new weapons
*Not 1 single toxic player found in 12h (Wow!)
*Maybe only 1 cheater found in 12h
*Good player/clan statistics

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
*No voice support
*Hackers
*Inventory got some flaws
*Poor menu GUI
*No report or vote/kick system
*Why 4 different types of currency? Makes no sense

My Rating: 2.5 out of 5 stars"
16476,"pay-to-win



Edit: Devs are trying to silence critique."
16477,The game like AVA Feeling~ But more best is Black Squad game!!!!! they shoot tehy kills they gun they anyway they Mission checkpoints And the effect of the head is super refreshing! that's how it is I want to said.
16478,"This is a very well made shooter, and take that from someone who's logged 3500 hours in CSGO alone and some thousand more hours in several other shooters since the early 90's.

- Doesn't feel like Early Access at all, zero issues found so far.
- No crashes or bugs, also great performance, should run perfect on any PC.
- Super fast paced and very skill dependent.
- Lovely sound for headshots, adds to the satisfaction of shooting that guy in the face with your bolt action sniper!
- Lots of free weapons to try out and zero pay-to-win of any kind, what you can buy is purely cosmetic stuff and XP boosters.
- Several game modes so there's something for everyone, I personally enjoy TDM the most.
- The devs seem to care a lot about feedback from the playerbase, way more than is the case for most games. Super sweet!

Note: I've seen several reviews complaining about cheaters. So far I've met zero cheaters and to be quite frank I feel like these reviews come from people that quite simply suck at this type of game and are consistently at the bottom of the scoreboard with 3 kills and 27 deaths. Poor guys, gettin' rekt isn't fun 8("

16480,"8,989 In-Game but can't find one game on any server."
16481,WTF BEST GAME I EVER SEE MATE
16482,My Favourite Game
16483,"3 servers - chunky connection - 15ms pings against 300ms
slow ""improvements"" of game (the Devs have no idea what they are doing)
Too many hackers the few ""pro"" players that gets banned just rejoin again after a short period
endless server maintances, FPS drops from 140 to 20 randomly
shots not getting reg
only 7000 avg plays this game worldwide
etc. etc."
16484,No Thanks
16485,No Aussie servers
16486,Suck my d!ck
16487,very confusing. The tutorial gives you the most confusing directions.I hopped into a multiplayer game and it was probably the hardest ive ever seen a multiplayer. Everyone is already really good and again the controls are bad.
16488,"You're better off spending your time in a casino than in their shop.
There is nothing that feels less rewarding than spending your money on boxes and get a crap ton of trash that expires.

Want a costume option? Getting one costs you around €500, if you're unlucky. It costs around €220 for a guaranteed reward. This is around a third of the costume option cost.

Pricing based on the 14.000 bullet (€100) option which is their cash shop currency.

Valofe is a graveyard for games. 
They use Google Translate for support.

Normally I don't care if skins are expensive but this is exceeding all limits Valofe should be banned from Steam if they knew how this company works."
16489,don't play this seriously play it only for the memes
16490,"If you are new at the game expect to be wrecked mercilessly.
What i mean is the game starts you off with guns that have pretty much nerf bullets.
Skills dont transfer over to this game. 
The sniper rifle you start with takes 3 shots to kill someone.
headshots are worthless here, while you waste your time trying to kill them you get wrecked by seniors with guns that actually work.

Roblox has better FPS mehanics than this game.
0/10 I would not reccomend"
16491,"You can get every gun in the game just by playing, no money needed to be spent, unless your talking about skins. There are not many hackers in this game, making it more fun. Also it has a nce selection of gamemodes if you ask me.  Maybe adding more skins to the Ak-47Gl would be nice."
16492,"sooo. 2 years and 1.4k hours after original review.

If you dont have full party/squad to play with, dont bother, srsly.
Balance is shifted towards spray'n'pray. damage increase to spray guns, ROF decrease for damage oriented guns, pretty obv direction to make the game more casual.
Small to no effort on blocking the cheaters/hack users, at some point hax were playing at ESL events and beign caught only through visuals by spectators with no detection from the anti-cheat.

16501,"Very good game , fps and its easy to learn , but the down size is the gernades is too powerfull and its like a candy ,, if they just remove the gernades it will be awesome game , and the other thing that made me very angry is when you want to grab a weapon on the ground you must go very close to it like above it and click for 1000000 second to grab it , by then you will be dead ,,, other than that the game is cool"
16502,ez xd
16503,Very relaxing and enjoyable game without stupid mechanics. Easy to transparent skills from other games. I was 2 years Global Elite in CS GO and 5x Diamond/Season in Destiny2. Drawbacks are really not friendly AR/SMG ADS mechanics and nades on TDM. Overall easy to keep 2.0 K/D each game that making game really enjoyable without any stress.
16504,"My go to FPS. There are better , I guess, but this game is just on its own level. Not exactly easy to just jump in but quickly figure out. If your already accustomed to the wasd controls then no problem. Many different maps and always enough players to make for a good kill time. Nothing like popping in for a 10 min kill party. Always come out wanting another 10 minutes lol."
16505,Free and not pay to win.
16506,Its Simply Amazing
16507,Good game even though i dont normally like fps games best to play with 3 friends as its tough to git gud and thats how many you need for your own match
16508,"Terrible. Why would you play this? It's extremely uncomfurtable to play, the sensitivity is out of wack. Don't get this game."
16509,"Black Squad is an Unreal Engine 3 powered tactical shooter developed and published by Neowiz Games. It aims to compete with other lobby based Korean tactical shooters like CrossFire and Alliance of Valiant Arms. Like other tactical shooters players earn money by playing games and use it to purchase new weapons to use on the battlefield. Play each round as either the Vipers (Terrorists) or the Peacekeapers (UN Backed Counter-Terrorists) across multiple maps and game modes.

Black Squad Key Features:

Varied Game Modes – Enjoy 10+ unique game modes from traditional team deathmatch / demolition to more exotic VIP defense.
Stat Tracking – Track your individual performance (KDR/Dmg/Headshots/etc) with each individual weapon.
Quickplay Matchmaking – Skip the pesky server lobby and find a match quickly.
Familiar Gameplay / Interface - Inspired by traditional Korean based lobby shooters like AvA and Combat Arms."

for those they dont like game and think is unbalance first of all u must got some skills to play this game.. i mean the 2 left hands gamers better go away or say something bad about this game to show us your  low skilled perfomer..
and i must say this game got fantastic graphics"
16519,"This game is actually really fun and it is very easy to hop into and just play instantly, and easy to learn as well. Although there are some mechan. issues as in why is the ""Enter"" key the chat command. Plus the main menu is a little confusing as well due to my friends having complaints and myself. But other than that, this is a very fun and easy game.

16520,"Well, the best way to describe this would be: Free to play Counter-Strike. It is fast paced, could be fun, you can run it on a potato, but the problem I encountered in my 4 games I played is that a lot of guys are camping, so I don't know, give it a go and see for yourself if you are into camping."

Tips to become pro: 
1: keep moving and tapping because there is no movement inaccuracy. 
2: Use macro for crouch otherwise you won't be able to survive in this game. 
3: bind a key on your mouse for macro with pistol if you want to become a perfect sniper. 
4: don't spend money on boxes. They are rigged.  
Have a toxic day with game if you ever tried to play fair."
16525,Awesome FPS Game.. Awesome Graphics.. Love this Game.. but hard to get free drops like steam cards
16526,"nice free shooting game ever. But optimization sucks, hope they will improve it in future"
16527,"I barely write any reviews , but maybe thats because most games don't really have much to offer nowadays , coming to the point Black Squad is really one of those gems that are hard to come-by. These guys aren't being sarcastic when they say best f2p shooter in the market, I would argue to say this is one of the best fps shooter games i played period. They combine modern graphics and shooter dynamics with old school cs style gameplay . My friends hate me when i tell them it's better than cs-go but it truly is imo. It's not nearly completed but if they can get more playerbase and improve overall layout i believe this will become a big title in the future. F2P or not shoting dynamics are one of the best i have seen on any game so far . This game really reminds me of MW2 and all of her past glory XD :_). Just FINISH THE GAME please.! Thanks."

overall, fun and simple.

you will like it ;)"
16551,"The game for the most part is fun. They try to keep it fair for everyone, by allowing you to buy guns with in game money rather than having to pay to play( with equality in weapons) however for some reason you can upgrade weapons yet not body armor which I find kinda lame. Also sometimes there are problems with game, even when tour wifi is at 5 bars and 15 ms ping rate when you get logged into game your ping rate jumps up to 3 or 400 ms ping rate which is LAGG nightmare so you have to logout and back on to fix it. over all it's a good game. OH 1 Major SCREWUP. at anytime a host of game can kick you from map not to return with no reasoning or vote. I have been kicked for playing good and I have been kicked before game even started for NO reason at all!! this is bullshit!! should be a vote % like WARFRAME does!!"

16553,"Simple and easy gunplay, but that's why this game is so bad. One match and I can already tell that running and gunning with no worry for accuracy is the way to play, I dropped 30 kills without stopping once. Fix guns pls"
16554,"Good game, just like blackshot."
16555,counter strike 1.6 has better quality than this... this is garbage.
16556,"LOVE IT! looks great, feels great, competitive, fast, and exciting. probably one of the best free to play FPS games out there"
16557,"its awesome
"
16558,"Sucks, I cant play. I wish there was a server near Canada.
Anyways I think the gameplay for the tutorial was okay.
"
16559,Really good game for low grade laptops/pcs. I highly suggest you get it. Runs well.
16560,"There are some cheaters, but the game is amazing, it is NOT Pay2Win, it might seem like it, but it is just cosmetics. Great game!"
16561,"this game sucks

16565,Good very good
16566,"Awesome multiplayer fps game.Good shooting experience.Sound and graphics could be improved further,otherwise a good game for fps lovers."
16567,Game sucks
16568,"Its simple and enjoyable.
I suggest it ."
16569,Great graphic game
16570,I would totally recommend this game. This is the first game i played in steam and i totally loved it. I am sure if u give it a try u will love it also...its a lot like counter strike global offensive
16571,Great game I really enjoy it and I'd recommend it to csgo fans but you need to add voice chat it's needed in 5v5 and stuff like that typing all the time is pretty hard especially when your giving call outs
16572,best free game fps
16573,wow this..........................................................................
16574,A mix between CSGO and CoD
16575,V  V  V   GOOD GAME
16576,"
it's the best I recommend"
16577,"Most amazing and decent game for all gamers.From Budget gamers to High end gamers.
The graphic quality is very reasonable so all can play.
One more thing is to add free rifles[1 or 2].
Tar is very common but should be more options to choose gun in startung of game that will be awesome.
Awesome game love playing it."
16578,"If you are looking for an entertaining first person shooter with a style similar to ""Counter Strike,"" but all the charm and dazzle of a obviously foreign game, then look no further. 

The biggest selling point of Black Squad is that there is absolutely ZERO pay-to-win. That is, for the most part, true. Everything in the game you can obtain with a currency that you can obtain exclusively in game, or you can purchase cosmetic skins for each weapon.

The catch is that the skin and the weapon are not sold separately. Meaning, if you want to buy the skin, you buy a weapon with it. Meaning if you don't already own that weapon, then technically you are ""paying-to-get-that-weapon-early"" (which some people consider pay-to-win).

Gameplay is similar to ""Counter Strike,"" but with some modifications. Players enter the game with custom classes, with each weapon having preset attachments. LOTS of weapons have grenade launchers, which I have found to be rather useless. This game is probably a bit closer to ""Crossfire,"" but with less microtransactions and a managable way of getting into games.

Maps are pretty much completely symmetrical, meaning you won't really know which side of the map you spawn on, save for a few routes that are on opposite sides. There isn't really anything special to the maps, so you'll probably get bored quickly playing on them (unless you're lame and like boring things).

One of the highlights of the game is the special abilities each class has access to in Battle modes. My favorite is the STEYR .50 sniper. I think the game is reccomendable on that alone. Getting to COMPLETELY OBLITERATE your enemies with an explosive sniper is the GREATEST FEELING EVER.

8/10 would pay-to-get-weapon-early again"

Don't download this game only because it's free bro. Dont lost your time."

16586,no nice
16587,"this game is not on the ''angry eastern-european raging players'' side so try it out before its too late



the first game you play you will suck, just down on the leaderboard, but the second, OOOOH, you will be on top of the leaderboard, that was with me atleast"
16588,Easy game
16589,Really really really bad.. worst than you thought as you continued to read this
16590,"nice

16591,"better than csgo

11/10"
16592,yummy game 10/11
16593,"This is an awesome game, I dont know what i have been missing for years, anyway, i dont look for free steam games that much, but this is like a key, this must be a boy game though, but idc, its what i decide, and what i want, to be to a boss at this game, and get it more playable, people playin it more, so I think i recommend playin this awesome game!"
16594,Very good game except for the fact that the servers for NA are not centralized. So the West Coast gets 90+ ping.
16595,"after more than 200 hours spent with this game I do not recomend this game. why?

positive things:
-realy free for play
-you can buy almost any weapon and you dont have to pay
-lots of server and players
-good primary weapons types and numbers

negative things:
-many cheaters ( and I had ratio more than 2 K/D) but they have 15 or sometimes more , wallhack, you can find videos on the net how they are cheating...
-the worst autobalance system I have ever seen. It slightly works when game starts, but players that join during match are put randomly to some team (not better players to loosing team) so often it ends noobs vs veterans and no joy at all
-maps are badly designed (ie harbor noon)
-specializations are not balanced, turrent is overpowered( IMHO I find it overpowered, and too dificult to destroy with primary gun - even machine gun is not very efective)
-very few players cooperate during gameplay
-often LAAAAAG
-if player with PING more than 600ms joins, he is teleporting and no walking so impossible to hit

"
16596,"very good but
You must add a zombie mod
sniper mod very bad"
16597,"Similar to CSZombies, pay to win, if you don't pay or level up per day you will be in disadvantage due to the weapons that only can be bought by cash do 40% dmg than normal weapons... If you are gonna spend money in this i recommend you buy CSGO that is far better and have the same mechanics without HACKERS..."
16598,"Very good game, has a cs:go feeling but it's free to play, definitly has potential."
16599,"Shitty clone of Call of Duty and CS:GO.
10 bleeding eyes/10"
16600,A very good game that is really good at giving out boxs and other goodies. Has many modes that are fun and enjoyable. Great game.
16601,solid first person shooter.........free to play and good game mechanics.........for a free to play it is better then most paid shooters.......
16602,this game suck my dick
16603,"DOESNT EVEN HAVE AUS SERVERS 

TRAAAAAAAASH"
16604,"Like p2w? This is your type of game! Like continuously running back to where you died just to die instantly again? This game is definitely for you. Like spawning and immediately being hit by a grenade? Looking like your type of game! Yeah, just don't get this game, it's really bad."
16605,Way way way way better than CS 10/10
16606,"This game is really good gameplay and graphics wise. The feel to it is very smooth, if you like fps games then you will love Black Squad. Its also free to play which makes it fair for everyone <3"
16607,"So I've played my fair share of this, and found out alot about it, and to make a long list short:
Pros:
- Can be fun
- Fast fps game

Oh man the Cons:
- Found alot of the maps were unbalanced or really one sided
- The Skill level matchups is uneven and can, again, be one sided
- Alot of one-shot-one-kill positions around maps that almost leads to spawns, which makes spawncamping often
- Alot of spawncamping also
- You can't gain tracktion if you begin to loose in TDM, which often leads to defeat.

-Basically it's an fast, simple game with quite alot of things to equip, but having to earn credits and buy grenades for an extended period of time (1, 3, 7, etc days) doesn't make sense besides keeping the players from hogging all the credits.

-The maps can be either symmetrical, mirrored or onesided which can be good or bad, and with one sided i mean one of the teams have better holding and/or ambush positions, better line of sight, or just more cover.

-The weapons are quite nice, I was very fond of the starting weapon until switching weapons from knife while running to gun at contact was out of sync with my reaction time, which meant i got killed even though i was firing but the animation was too slow to actually fire anything at all. (might just be me that hasn't got the hang of it, but annoying as hell)

-I found the overall skill level strange, in one map you compete against equals and having a good fight then the next map you can get demolished or demolish them. It's often the maps you play that determine the outcome.

-Can't really recommend this, before they have tweaked some of the content, and I wont come back before that either."

16615,"Can u guys make more gun for the game like L96a1 , mp5 , tmp and add more mode to play in clan match and add more mode like free for all, domination . I"
16616,"New but still better Netcode than CSGO.Valve,pls fix."
16617,"Fun FPS, especially when playing with a friend.  Just don't get upset if you have a streak of being killed or games lost.   There are quite a few people that hack in this game with aim bot and other hacks that are available out there."
16618,hey when will there  be a server for aus/nz?
16619,"No option coming to start game, server options not highlighting,very disappointing."
16620,"[b]DISCLAIMER:[/b] As the game is in early access and seems to be a game made to last for a long time, points made in this review are subject to change in the future.

[h1]First view:[/h1]
It's relatively well balanced between ARs and snipers (haven't seen any shotguns used yet) as well as pistols, everything feels great, it's easy to run as it doesn't require any high-end equipment (I get 180 frames on my GTX 1060 laptop), doesn't have ping issues (unless you're far from every server possible), has quite a lot of people playing even early in the morning, doesn't seem to have any big hacker problem (unlike CS:GO and post-year COD games) and gives the same feeling of joy I had playing Combat Arms for the first time in 2008.

The game gives you plenty of in-game currency to buy at least one weapon of choice right off the bat and doesn't seem to have any weapon that would cost hundreds of hours to acquire. It also doesn't have anything P2W related, as the only microtransactions available are for skins (at least as far as I can see).

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
If you want a F2P FPS, this is the one. As a fan of FPS games, I am very satisfied with the current game, especially considering it's made by a relatively new studio as their first game ever (they started the company in late 2011, so 6 and a half years ago). I cannot wait to see what they add in the future, and I will gladly keep an eye out for any new releases they might have for us in the future."
16621,"dedicated servers(Not in AUS, Dealbreaker), great shooting mechanics(Mediocre at best) and amazing netcode(It's a 30 hz server so rather dissapointing) .

Not worth the d/l."
16622,"Honestly amazing, I've already favrioted it. It is honestly the best game I've ever played."
16623,"solid free to play game

16636,"great game, its a little slow for my pc but thats only my fault, hope you can maybe fix that"
16637,This is so awesome game and I really like playing this game... so fun to play....
16638,yes
16639,love this game
16640,I've had a lot fun  playing this game only issue are cheater's but the game over all is fun i recommend playing it
16641,Comforting me when i get a 1 week cooldown bcoz of stupid russians since 2017
16642,I recommend this game if you like to dodge grenades in death match
16643,"A decent FPS shooter game. A game similar to what I used to play called Blackshot. Graphics are sorta simple. Only ""issue"" I have with this game is where they match players anyhow. For example, You can be literakky a newbie and they match you with super high ranking players such as lieutanants, captains etc. which is sorta frustrating but I do understand that it's cause of quick match. But even so, you should be matched with players around the same rank or same skill level. 

Another improvement I hope to see is the in game lobby/menu, it looks sorta old and messy and hopefully that is improved. The shop section is what sorta annoys me. When I want to buy a certain type of weapon for example like an assault rifle, I have to constantly keep scrolling up and down to find assault rifles which is sort of a drag. My suggestion is that in the shop, it should have multiple tabs that categorise each weapons and when visiting a tab such as ""SMG"", it shows all the SMG available which would defenitely save time and lessen the trouble. (in my opinion)

Overall, it's a good game so far. Not really Pay 2 Win also so I do recommend it."
16644,awesome one of my favorite shooters on pc
16645,Uninstall simulator
16646,"Absolutely love it, only problem is the low variety of weapon, melee, graneade or armor options; though I expect there to be more on the Release.
Another problem is the shop, you can buy any weapon immediately, no level requierments or anything. So you can just buy the best weapon of its class, play a few more hours, get the best weapon in another class and so on. All that can be achieved even before a high ranking sgt. Please add level restrictions and make the best guns cost less than the other ones, 1000 ingame currency isnt enough.
But overall really fun and competitive game with great and smooth gameplay!"
16647,Good game but is really for me glitched.
16648,gay
16649,asshole game
16650,it doesnt even let me open this game -9999999999999999999999999999/10
16651,"Thoughts from a CS:GO player with limited play time in Black Squad:

The default guns allowed me to immediately lay waste to other players in TDM Quick Match.
The free AK variant I got in a box was far more effecient at killing than my free defaults, but not incredibly necessary.

Playing the 8v8 bomb mode Demolition is fun. You can walk silently and creep around the maps like in CS:GO. Runners are easy to follow. Maps are small enough to make first confrontations very quick after round start and are pretty well designed, although flawed in some aspects.

Only problem I have is that I really can't enjoy Demolition 8v8. In the late evening Pacific time I could never match into a game that had anywhere near full players and the population appeared to be incredibly low because I kept seeing the same players over and over. And that's after waiting around 400+ seconds searching before a match is found. Also, most matches I played always balanced oddly, like putting six players on one side and three on the other.

But, it's definitely a fun Call of Duty-ish game with a CS:GO mode."
16652,The hacking is frustrating and annoying and takes away the joy of the game. Still recommend it because its free and the best one yet imo.
16653,"Very good gameplay. It's very fun, not P2W, Fast TTK, Large selection of weapons and good mechanics. Overall a perfect F2P FPS."
16654,SO FAR THIS IS A  AMAZING GAME LOVE IT BUT I HAVE A SUGGESTION can you put final kill cams in
16655,"It is a nice game,but the lag and high ping on eu server is frustrating."
16656,good
16657,its coollllll wow
16658,its a great free games and i lke how it has the feeling of csgo .
16659,"sound works normal until i put my headphones 
any idea why that happens or how to fix it?"
16660,"I played for about 15 minutes, I can honestly say it is one of the worst games I have ever played. Main menu layout and UI is the most literal unintuitive interface I ever used. Overly difficult to add friends and/or play with them. In game controls are the worst I've ever used, there is no sprint, crouching when you press the button you don't stay crouched, when you right click to aim, it STAYS aimed after you let go of your click, who in the world looked at that and said, yeah that's a good idea? playing a quick match, teams spawn WAY too close to eachother, step 5 feet and you're already getting shot at by members of the other team, it is the WORST COD/CS:GO rip off I have ever played, and unless this game improves greatly after the time of this review, I can not recommend it to even my worst enemy."
16661,this was a good game before the devs kinda gave up on it. the models for sights look awful now some guns are just down right pathetic. and the cheating is out of control. hopfully the devs will fix these problems because i really loved this game and used to play it all the time. but now im going to take a break untill atleast some of these problems are fixed.
16662,this game has dumbest ever
16663,"The game reminds me of old school fps such as Crossfire -- it's an old-style fps.

16664,no

( if your bored of cs:go, which I doubt some of you are, just download this and you'lldrift off into this game.)"

P.s: TAC RELOAD!!!!!"
16676,"So cheap that you want to puke.
So many glitches. for example: mouse sensivity gets stuck to default which too  low to handle the gun and there's no way to fix it yourself.

Play only if you have nothing else to play!

16682,"This is currently FPS shooter with the best graphics so far. SF and SF2, AVA and CS (In my opinions)
One problem is IT TAKES TOO MUCH MONEY TO BUY STUFF IN SHOPS

Pros:
It's free
It's not pay to win
Gun designs and animatons are great for a free game
Getting kills is satsyfying
good maps(even if they have the same layouts)
A good game to get if you just spent all your money on a PC, its free, and its not pay to win like many other free games

Con:
No in game communication
Player models are bland

16692,Very
16693,I have new 0 lvl clan and when i want play clan match my oponent is always 2lvl+ clnas and it's so bad and impossible. please balance this next update it will be better <3 thanks
16694,"More like bLAG Squad. This game is just dumb, the gunplay is dumb, the weapon choices are dumb and worst of all: Your teammates are dumb.
Its like nobody really understands the game besides the modes are so easy to do so, but still, they dont."
16695,.
16696,One of the best Multiplayer FPS I have ever played. I will recommend it to every one as it is Free to play.
16697,"Mean game, should make oceania servers tho..."
16698,"I'm not that much of a multiplayer person. Black Squad is the second multiplayer FPS that I've played so far, first one was Team Fortress 2 and I must say I am really getting addicted to this game.
Awesome game, the community is not toxic so far, matches are quick and kinetic. In fact Black Squad has filled me with such positivity towards multiplayer games that I think I'm going to try out more multiplayer games.
.
Peace :-)"
16699,GAME IS OK
16700,I really like this game
16701,"I'd rather kill myself on purpose than play this uninspired garbage. If you like this game, fuck you."
16702,"bad game
bad players
not fun"
16703,The game won't open please fix it :(
16704,"So,
I decided to start up this game again and I was VERY pleased with how much it had improved. This has huge potential, and only needs a few tweaks for it to be amazing. This review will be fairly brief as I don't have that much time invested into it, but hopefully this should give some idea of what to expect in the game (this review was also written in less than 10 minutes, so please excuse the lack of structure and organization lol)

Gameplay wise, it is very reminiscent of CS (in certain ways and I'm also going to be comparing it to CS a lot in this review) and also has it's own kinks. It feels faster than CS but it requires less control over recoil on the automatic guns as their spread isn't as dramatic. The TTK is also very similar to CS, usually requiring only 1-2 bullets to the head to kill an enemy. The best part about it is that the game is NOT pay to win. All three of the guns you acquire at the start are already very capable of dominating the other team (as long as you are good) and you can purchase high tier guns with the starting amount of money.

Some issues I had with the game so far was the low amount of gold you receive even if you are at the top of the leaderboards. Also, some of the guns are noticeably stronger than others and are fairly unbalanced (while it is still possible to use the ""underpowered"" weapons). Another issue was map design. At least in TDM (the gamemode I spent the most amount of time on), once the enemy team, or your team, gains control of a certain area, it is very easy for the enemy team to spawn trap your team on certain maps. There is also parts of the map which are unneccessary and obscure vision on other maps as well. Some other suggestions I would make is for the ability for the community to produce maps.

Overall, the game is very fun, although far from perfect. I'll be enjoying this game for a while."
16705,"Having such a fun playing this game !!!
It only needs competitive matchmaking and it will be amazing"
16706,"Sometimes, you gotta just appreciate a game just because its free.
But this is one hell of a game even though its free.
If you've ever wanted to buy an FPS game then dont buy one just play this for free.
However there's actually a lil bit of pay2win.
I personally love this game. I give it 5 stars"
16707,"Wont open...




















asians..."
16708,This game is very good ...graphics is ok..and maps are small ...easy for kids to play..
16709,"This game is [b]pretty fun[/b] , just not fun with [b]AI battle[/b]. You can [b]meeting newbies, veterans, camper, cheapers(Just man too cheap, not a cheap price), grenadiers, commanders and juniors.[/b]

16711,Great Game Haveing Lots of fun Must Get
16712,A bland and generic korean fps that doesent do anything new or unique. If it were released 10 years ago it still wouldnt be impressive.
16713,Too many cheaters.
16714,"Great and fun game but if you not in the following regions: East Asia; Southeast Asia; Europe; North & South America you will be kicked for high ping. This makes the game unplayable and extremely Crap. Don’t download if you want to be kicked 90% of the time. When you contact CM or NW staff on the official channels (Discord or the Support) you don’t get feedback. On the Discord it tells you in short you can’t message any of the staff members and the only one you can contact just ignores you flat out, not even thank you, we will take it under consideration. I don’t recommend this game if you not in the above-mentioned regions."
16715,"If you are a ten year old who can't spend money on games because mommy doesn't give you her credit card, then go ahead and buy it. However, no self-respecting, decent human being should ever play this game."
16716,"Interesting Game, but maps are too small, 
the randomizer for making teams is a good thing except when it somehow seems to stack clans against non clans..
BattleEye cheat system seems to work well, but need tweaking, only because various times, either myself or friends
have emptied a large magazine into a player, they jump around like they're retarded, fire off one shot and you're dead.
Also seen grenade survivals, and aimbot style of play...so battle eye needs to get updated continually...
aim assist or aimbots seem to be more and more, seeing players with 55 kills, with 3-6 deaths, ...nobody is that good, or rather, the other team is not that bad,...and those aren't sniper shots..

can't record it as it uses too much resource, making for crappy game play, and when it does happen, the likelihood of it happening twice or more is not realistic.

Shooting through boxes and walls......fix it..
certain boxes and glitch walls are allowing kills through the wall when the player isn't even being seen

The silencer option (where you're not compromised on a map)....you are, players seem to be able to pick up where you are crouching down ...not normal

Otherwise an interesting game, quick games, usually good teams randomly set up...
but the cheats need to be kept to a minimum....

While the developers do rely on screenshots and stuff, it's not always possible to do, so having MOD's play the game or spectate the game would go a long way to diminishing the cheat aspect.

16717,It feels like a cheap made in china csgo
16718,fps drops this game
16719,Trash game trash game
16720,Lag is a huge problem and there is almost no varriaty. The graphics were okay but not stellar. You can't win a single game if you do not spend money on the online shop. Over all if the game play was balanced it would be an okay game. But the game play makes the game almost intolerable.
16721,Hello this game is very good it has ups and downs I do recommend it to others but I had a pack opening and I didn’t open it right when I clicked on it and it disappeared and I couldn’t get it back which pissed me off
16722,"Black Squad is Free to play game, however if we compare BS with similar games , BS has some of the postive sides.
Some of them:
1) no pay2win , only cosmetics.
2) diffrents modes, such as deathmuch - like cs and destruction - where 32 player trying destroy enemy base
3) low percent of cheaters
4) nice guns with scopes

Unfortunately BS has some of negative parts, such as bad servers in Europe servers.
That's all folks)"
16723,I was unable to find a match in quick match no matter what mode I chose and I got kicked from a custom server for doing well. When I was able to play it was fairly entertaining but in my opinion it's not worth the grief. If you are looking for a good time I suggest looking somewhere else.
16724,"A fun mix of C.S.G.O and C.O.D esc gameplay, it free and a ton of Fun. Easy to play (if your used to Fps) decent weapon verity.
Good map verity. 
Overall 8/10 from me"
16725,"Do I recommend this game?

Half of me says yes, the other half says no.

As of writing this review, I have just under 4 hours of playtime, and I honestly feel like I've done nearly everything.

This game is very repetitive, and gets stale after simply an hour of playing it.

Now, I understand that this is an early version of what the game will become, but it just doesn't have that thing that makes you wanna come back and play more, yet.

The maps really aren't too unique, and a decent amount of them are one-sided or mirrored.

The gunplay on the other-hand is impressive. It is fluent, yet stiff, but in a good way.

Meaning, whenever you should feel light on your feet, you do, and whenever you are taking it slow, if feels just as you'd expect.

The weapon unlock system is similar to that of COD: Online, where you use ingame credits to ""rent"" or permanently unlock weapons and cosmetic items.

While there are weapons you can buy, paid weapons don't give you any sort of significant advantage.

The weapons are balanced pretty well, but the players aren't.

Meeting cheaters is unfortunately a common occurance.

Implementing BattleEye or a custom anti-cheat would be a major upgrade to the game and it's player-base.

The only other problems are performance, and believe it or not, the tutorial.

Now, the game itself runs alright, but it tends to stutter or bottle-neck rather often.

The tutorial isn't horrible, but it has problems.

It introduces some physics that are rarely used, is very event-choppy, and honestly kinda of awkward as a whole.

In conclusion, once an anti-cheat is active, performance is more stablized, and a bit more creativity is used in level design, this will be a great game.

I will be checking back everynow and then to see how the game's evolved, along with editing this review.

The game is good, not P2W. i hope developer can handle the cheater, thanks"
16727,this game is fun and competitive but once in a wile you get magor lag
16728,"very bad game , no balance in match making ."
16729,"This game is bad :)|


Really bad, like worse than cs:go's hitreg :)

Worse than DogZ4 run time crashing ur game."
16730,"I really enjoy this game, it's not pay to win and it's alot of fun"
16731,Unbalanced as fork. 100% Unplayable. All of the 20 or so rounds I have played have been complete blowouts one way or another. Spawn camping is rampant because you can just purchase better guns for real money. Servers are slow to start most of the time aswell. Would not recomend to anyone.
16732,"epic game nice graphics good gameplay 
nice teammates is not believable :p
but it is still a great game"
16733,Great FTP game one of the best fps ones on steam. A lot like CSGO.
16734,F2P CoD
16735,"I recommend this game, because it gets addicting. For me it is a good game to play with friends and do funny stuff on it. Best part of this game is that they implemented Clans and Clan Matches. Which means that your clan and another clan can battle it out to see who is the best. Another thing i like is that people have to learn the gun recoils, like some guns have a bigger recoil than the others and some have almost no recoil and that makes it interesting."
16736,noob game
16737,"Once upon a time I would give this game a positive review as it was acctually a good game, however with the level of shit that the devs are I can no longer give it a positive review, thus the new review. The game has gone to shit. The devs care more about content releases than fixing the major issues within the game, constent refusal to either serverlock, or ping cap servers breaks any form of competative playing that they wish to promote. (Somehow they believe that a 200 ping is ""ok"". The game has broken guns and classes, not to mention modes that are just flat out stupid. I am all for the new airorne mode, if it was just done correctly, they finally made a new ""good"" map compared to the shit storm of trash maps that existed prior, and it is for a mode that when you drop in you cant even control your decend. 90% of the maps in this game are beyond broken and promote staking out the enemy spawn with ak's and picking off the other team right as they move. competative gameplay in this game is laughable as the devs refuse to ping cap the competative channels forcing you to play against people with pings greater than .999. the games previously best point, that you could access 100% of the content without paying a penny and just grind is no longer even true as now the best knifes and one of the best guns are stuck behinf lootboxes. The devs also act as if they wish for feedback, and a lot of good feedback is given however it seems as if almost none of it is ever implemented. Not to mention there is a known issue about people hacking, I will give it credit that there are less now than there was a couple months ago, but you still see them quite often here and there.

3/10
shitty devs ruin another great game"
16738,"You will ejoy this game so much, this is a perfect free game, i love it"
16739,to many hacker trash game 1/1111
16740,"This is actually a really fun free-to-play on Steam. If you are like me and don't really want to pay for the higher end weapons, you'll have to grind for what you need. But if you can look past the grind, it is a very fun and fast paced shooter."
16741,"Map design is terrible. Game has no sprint. You can move faster with your knife out but it takes about 1.5 seconds to ADS once you stop running with the knife. It's also a serious camp fest. The main menu and UI is awful and difficult to navigate. You have to re-equip the supressor and turn on your red dot laser everytime you respawn. They should both stay on if you equip them at the start of a round. No option to toggle crouch. Only positives I can say are the graphics are OK and the gunplay is OK. If you're looking for a free FPS game then google ""Ironsight"". It's far better than this and completely free with no pay to win."
16742,"Foarte tare !

16751,"This game is one of the best F2P Shooter I have played. The servers are really good in compare to other games and also the whole engine works fine. The only negative thing is the anti cheat programm. It doesn't really work, everyone who want to hack in this game is able to do it. I hope they will get a better one or improve it to get much more cheat free lobbys."
16752,"This game is literally every Asian FPS made in the past 10 years. It plays just like Crossfire, AVA, etc. 

That being said, I played for about 2 hours and didn't experience any blatant hackers, and people seemed to be friendly, so it leaves a good impression even though the game itself is horribly bland."

16758,"This game has the nostalgic feel of the good old days where you can hop in a match and play,you can be casual or competitive as you like,gun selection needs to be bigger,but even with what's in store you can enjoy yourself plenty.Overall I would describe it as either CoD:MW2 days or CS 1.6,fps games which trully brought the best moments.Keep on the good work."
16759,head shots are very satisfying in this game 7/10
16760,They started to ban innocent players me and my clan were playing Cream cake mode as 4 but they suddenly banned us for cheating we have never used cheat in this game I had been playing since 2017 I even reached 5stars rank but they banned me for no reason think twice before start to this game because they can ban u one day for no reason
16761,"Most retarded map design I've seen in years. Grenade spam and camping galore.
The TTK is so short that accurate aim and going for headshots isn't really worth it.
Give this game a miss and play literally anything else."
16762,"UI is garbage, matchmaking garbage and feels like a game that would be a moble app"
16763,"was my first steam game I PLAYED.
Conclusion on basis of my game play...

1.WELL WORTHY GAMEPLAY..8/10
2.GRAPHICS ARE 7/10
3.CONTROLS 7/10
4.MATCHMAKING 8/10

AT last there are about negiligiable amounts of bugs and hacks in the game..
IF U ARE LOOKING FOR AN FREEWARE RPG SHOOTER THEN GO FOR IT...."
16764,this game is awesome and its free wtf
16765,"alright, but can u please add an oceania server? Thanks a million"
16766,Ehh... A common  low quality FPS game. It's my opinion some of you will be mad at me for saying this but i realy don't like the game.
16767,obviously good as new lunched
16768,Good
16769,"10/10 better than CSGO impo.
Has a nostalgic feel of online shooters from early 2000s; basically, it's fun. Every kill is satisfying. Every death gives a feeling of payback needed. A kill counter makes that payback feel all the better. To see that I've got 6 kills on a single player who finally took me down feels good, even though I lost the streak. If you play shooters, this game is a good pick-up and go. And for FREE? 

My only suggestion/gripe/statement-more just a moment of begging on my knees:  PLEASE PUT ITEMS IN STEAM STORE. Follow the path of monetary skins, like CSGO, PubG, etc. It'd make for much more interesting loot box openings. And a purpose besides, ""look at my shiny gun skin"" all the while that player is probably thinking, ""big fuckin' deal. you wasted your currency""."
16770,"Does do anything interesting or different, gameplay is mediocre and it doesn't really have an objective to work towards. Just shooting. I guess if thats your thing go for it"
16771,Matchmaking can smd
16772,"If your a cheap shit (like me) you will love this game. Fun game modes, small but very detailed maps that can be great for hallway shootouts, quick dashes and an easy way to find an enemy. Can be annoying when you have spawn Killers and there are a couple Hackers that you see for time to time but all great for a free game!"
16773,"It seems like one of thos echinese knock offs, it is very grindy and requires a lot of time into it, they say it is not pay to win, but it is cleary time to win. For example, you may have just started with a lot of potential skill in this game, however you will never know because of people who have acces to guns that require time to unlock. Compare this to the game that they compare themselves to, CS:GO, where Counter Strike's in game and community purchases are solely for cosmetics, but in this game you are given the option to spend your precious time grinding through the ranks and gain currency just to get a better gun to cheese people with. My one issue with this game is that they themselves say that there is no pay to win in any type of scenario, however this is not the case. Also, im surprised at how amazingly well the reviews are considering how much of a chinese knockoff it resembles. Take this review with a grain of salt, and with what you do with this review is completely up to you. 4/10 would not DL again (or play under any circumstance."
16774,better than cs 1.6
16775,Free to play & It's awesome!
16776,"Thoughts from a CS:GO player with limited play time in Black Squad:

The default guns allowed me to immediately lay waste to other players in TDM Quick Match.
The free AK variant I got in a box was far more effecient at killing than my free defaults, but not incredibly necessary.

Playing the 8v8 bomb mode Demolition is fun. You can walk silently and creep around the maps like in CS:GO. Runners are easy to follow. Maps are small enough to make first confrontations very quick after round start and are pretty well designed, although flawed in some aspects.

Only problem I have is that I really can't enjoy Demolition 8v8.  In the late evening Pacific time I could never match into a game that had anywhere near full players and the population appeared to be incredibly low because I kept seeing the same players over and over. And that's after waiting around 400+ seconds searching before a match is found. Also, most matches I played always balanced oddly, like putting six players on one side and three on the other.

But, it's definitely a fun Call of Duty-ish game with a CS:GO mode."
16777,"Basically a free COD with huge amount of players. 

The game is very fun even playing without friends. 

If you are like me have no friends then it is the game is for you. 10/10"
16778,I really think the matchmaking in quick match should improve. Like I cant find a match and find myself the only person that has a clan the rest of my team pure noobs against a team that is completely of clan members...I really think it's GARBAGE!!!

16782,"I dont think someone from NS STUDIOS is going to see this but whatever. I love this game it supper fun but the spawn camping is BS if possible there should be a zone around your spawn and if you get into the zone it give you 3 sec to get out of the zone or you die i would find this game more enjoyable if that was a thing. my last game i had 3 enemy turrents 1 big dude with the mini gun behind are spawn and about 5 ppl camping around are spawn 

PLS FIX"
16783,Lootboxes
16784,loading blank screen simulator

16786,"hello, please enter transfers (exchange) of weapons, knives skinny, it would be very good)"
16787,Very nice game!!
16788,This game is a fast pase action game i love everything in it but there are some small bugs your will rearly see them but the game its self is really good for a free to play game i highly recomend you get it
16789,interesting
16790,Highly underrated game.
16791,"not very recommended, but still recommend"
16792,"Gameplay of this game is a new challenge for me. The guns' recoil are real fun and fascinating. Love this game!
BTW i dont want to setting up my mouse speed again everytime i start playing this game. Pls make a cloud save for it. TY!"
16793,"The reason i downloaded this game was beacause it looked fun, had great reviews, and NO PAY-TO-WIN! So that's why i would recommend this game to anyone that doesn't like to spend money"

16797,"Fun game, brings memories of CS 1.6. Needs improvements like a spectator client in games."
16798,A game made in Unreal Engine that actually runs at an acceptable frame rate. Automatic 10/10 from me just for that.
16799,just get warface
16800,nice game
16801,"Don't play this game, It has potential, but that potential is killed with weapon limits, bad maps, and bad hit detection that ruins the potential this game has. Also, spawncamping is super easy to do. Valve pls fix.
"
16802,"a very nice game! i myself think is , maybe not better, but much funnier than CS GO. Lots of weapons , lots of maps, clans, it is nice. And i am sure the developers will add more!"
16803,"This game used to be amazing, now it is just full of hackers. Moderators do not seem to want to do anything about the hackers."
16804,"This is one of my favorite games, it's one of them where you can play for fun without been so mad when someone killed you, and you can play with one or 5 of your friends, in rest is all ok, if will be added voice chal that will be really awesome. In rest is very good. 


LIKE"
16805,If you are cs:go player you should play this!
16806,"A eminent game which has impressed me at the first time, really great"
16807,"Black Squad is not the kind of realistic or tactical shooter that you mostly play but it's more like fast paced FPS game that resembles those of old games like A.V.A, Warrock and Sudden Attack. You can think of it as Counter-Strike with CoD but with kind-of dated graphics and weird arcade style gameplay (personal opinion), 

This game is really easy to get into if you are used playing FPS games and it is really fun to play Team Deathmatch and other gamemodes (which involves maybe different tactics other than just killing) also there is competitive (ranked) and casual gamemodes to further allow the players to choose whether they want to torture themselves with hardcore gaming or stick with casual way of playing. 

However, I found the weapon system to be unlikeable. I know that Black Squad is a F2P game created with some slight microtransaction and premium currency in mind and it is not uncommon for free online games in Korea to have this kind of system but the fact that some of paid weapons or those from crates are superior than the default guns cannot be ignored and this puts you in disfavorable position when you play the game in the beginning. 

Some weapons have better recoil, rate of fire and whatever factors that grants great advantage in combat and default weapons are obviously inferior than the mentioned weapons. You can still overwhelm your opponents with these pea-shooters even against those with shiny gold-painted airsoft guns but only if you have maybe extraordinary skills capable of managing the terrible recoil and fully utilizing the damage of steel BBs that your craplauncher spews out. 

I am not saying that this game is straight P2W or the weapons are completely unbalanced but it is inevitable that you spend several perhaps tens of hours or real money before acquiring the better performing weapons that can [i]actually[/i] withstand against enemies with better guns (and skill).

Please note that I did not play much before posting this review but I won't be playing this game anymore.
Contents of this review is purely subjective and therefore it should not be taken seriously.
I recommend playing Black Squad and decide it for yourself if its worth playing or not."
16808,"the boobs physics is even better than the guns logic in this game
edit: Its even better, just add more characters that has big boobs and everyone will be happy."
16809,I like how this game isnt pay to win but also free. Keep it up
16810,gg
16811,one of the best f2p fps period
16812,"Really anoying game...pice of s*ht, but its for free :P"
16813,"I do not know what to say... i got 20 hours in 4 days i belive, im madly in Love. By far the best game! Unlucky i bought the wrong Gun for medals ;) would love to have a competetive gamemode! Well done developers

16821,I was suprised that this game was free.... its pretty cool.
16822,"After playing this game for almost 30 hours I'm ready to make my review. 

This game is really broken at the moment. You shoot players in the head, it doesn't kill, there should be a running feature in the game, not just switching weapons to move faster, Grenade launchers doesn't even kill. I've fired one at a player and the grenade landed one inch at him, it doesn't do jack. If your gonna play ""demolition"" mode, then be ready for the awful teammates its gonna give you. (Edit: 3/16/18): Now I'm sad to say that as soon as Black Squad dropped the Ping limit in the NA server, I been getting high ping lately, and I've heard other people complaining as well. This game needs to be developed and fix more before its fully released.

All said and done, you may ask why I recommended this game. Well if your looking for a free to play, fps shooter game that is somewhat like CS:GO and is not p2w, then this is for you. Just gotta find a way to get pass all these cons."
16823,"Gud Game if u have good skill at the start!
i liked it
9/10
why 9? well TDM small maps
everything else is GREAT"
16824,no
16825,"CS + COD = Black Squad
well this one pretty straight forward.
easy to play like a normal fps game and no overpowerd weapon
no pay to win at least not that much
i'll rate this one 7/10"
16826,Decent free for all game.
16827,I LIKEY
16828,"I think I was a little bit overly harsh when I said this game looks old. I looks modern, but nothing special. It does run really smoothly, and the netcode seems to be excellent. I have come to really enjoy the impact of my assault rifles. It is also really satisfying to stab enemies, and I have learned to use the run with knife mechanic to my advantage. 

My only complaints are that the maps a little small and not well detailed, and that there are a lot of choke points or kill zones which make it difficult to advance unless you have a skilled team that is able to coordinate its actions. It also seems like you don't sprint with the knife, so much as quick change it. You can't really sprint, although that is probably for the best considering that the maps are so compact. It would also be nice if there was some variety for the character models. Your only choices are grizzled guys and really soft looking girls. I'm not saying that there need to be cross dressing feminine guys or women who look like Iranian weightlifters, but  just a little bit of a mix. I will say that this developer has displayed [strike]more restraint in showing female skin than most games like this[/strike] much proficiency in boobie and ponytail physics, and that their presence adds color to what is otherwise a limited palette. 

I still really like this game. I hope it continues development, and that's not just because I invested money in my nylon-stocking, red-haired Tomb Raider character. 


First Impression:

The game looks like a mod from 2005, and plays like one too. However, I find it charming. The controls are really responsive and there is a great amount of control customization. Having sprinting being tied to having your knife out is kind of weird, but most people do that anyway in most games, so I guess it makes sense. This game reminds me of a graphically downgraded version of GiTS: First Assaut before the first update, as well as Blacklight: retribution. In my opinion, both of those games were much better in many ways, but this game has a lot of potential for those who have a similar itch to Call of Duty, but don't want to play that series for one reason or another. 

Definitely worth a shot."

i recommend to all :D LOVE THET GAME

16833,I have had a lot of fun on this game but there are a lot of hackers get better hack detecters
16834,Super fun and it's freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :D I love it xd <3 TDM Game mode is so convenient and fun if you want to just have a quick fps match.
16835,hackers everywhere
16836,"This review is coming from someone who mainly plays TDM. It's just the type of game I prefer to play.

Black Guard has some serious flaws that need to be fixed. 

The biggest one is that it's way to bloody easy to get spawn trapped. You always spawn at the same locations, it's not like CoD where the spawn will eventually change around the map to prevent you from being spawn camped. 

Getting trapped in spawn is utter hell, but it wouldn't be so bad if the spawn areas had some sort of cover you can immediately reach. Maybe the spawns could originate on a higher part of the map, just to give a height advantage to people who just spawn, but no. Often, the spawns will be in a flat, square room or an open space, with no effective and easy-to-reach cover you can get to within the spawn protection time. The only cover people who just spawn get are either doorways or stairs, it's absolutely atrocious. Of course, this could lead to the problem of people just camping in their spawn area, so I guess the best fix would be if you didn't bloody spawn in only 1 damn location.

It also wouldn't be so easy to get spawn traps if the maps dweren't so small. Even the medium-sized maps are tiny. I can run across the longest parts of the medium maps and get to the end within 20 seconds, they are way too small. If you are getting spawn trapped, it's hard to break out of it because the people who are entrenched can hold the spawners off long enough for the people who just got killed to get back to their defensive positions.


There's a big problem with the weapons, in that you can't test them. The weapons cost a lot of money compared to what you make. The highest amount of money I've seen someone make in a match is around 2000, so that's around 48 games just to unlock 1 weapon (and it's one of the cheaper weapons), assuming you're getting 2000 every game, which is unlikely. I can't even give a good review of the weapon balancing because it would cost so much money and take so much time to get a decent sample size of the weapons that I might as well marry the damn game at that point.

And if you buy a weapon that you don't like, you're screwed. You are stuck with that weapon. No take backsies, you buy the wrong weapon, you are fucked. Spend another day grinding away to get another chance to buy a gun that you might like.


I already mentioned that the maps suck because of how tiny they are, but they suck for other reasons, too. There's always some massive problem with the map. It can be too easy to get kills with grenades, or it mostly consists of long hallways, or it's too open, making it difficult to stay alive for long, just really annoying shit.


There's other small things in the game that a really annoying. 

You can't have suppressors attached and lasers turned on by default. I have no idea why, but it's real easy to forget to activate them. It would be nice if it was an option to start with your attachments ready from spawn.

You can't change the reticle on your weapons. You buy a weapon and whatever reticle it comes with, that's what you get. You can't change it. Why? I can change my crosshair all willy nilly, but the sights have to stay the same. Maybe I just prefer to have iron sights, but I can't even remove the sights! I hate getting stuck with a reticle that either hurts my accuracy because it's so big it's hard to see or aim with it, or it distracts me because it's an ugly little piece of shit. 


If you're interested in the game, go for it if you really want to, but only if you don't wanna pay any money for an online shooter and you don't already own an online shooter you like to play."
16837,"lot of grind to get new guns ..but yeah gives u rewards everyday under events...
everyone takes the snipers and camp at key points as there is no tommarow..
small and limited maps...
hit reg is broken.so much of crouch spamming in this game
i would not recommend..
but if u want free COD and CSGO g for it
no body plays compitetive maps in this game...well less people play them and team coordination for random players as there is no team speak chat atleast for compitetive maps"
16838,"Its ok. Think CSGO in UE and thats about the size of it.

EDIT: 3/2/2018: I like this a lot. Im terrible at it but I dont even care.

Remember, its a F2P. And for some reason there are a lot of people that get a shot shot kill every time. Walk up behind, unload, and you'll die. You'll see it. But at least you didnt pay $60+ like Battlefield and get stuck with this result. So,

Questions:

How are so many people able to make a one-shot kill while being shot?

Can we get a method for TDM that doesnt have crouch spammers sniping the spawn points?"
16839,Unbelieveable amount of keybindings to remember! The GUI feels awkard. I wanted to play this game but I feel this is too bloated. Why can't it just be a normal FPS?
16840,NICE GAME
16841,"CSGO ripoff with crossfire/combat arms mechanics and looks. Generally shit, avoid unless you like mediocre games."
16842,"This game is literally a Copy of GITS: SAC. If you dont mind literally every one taking the same stupid gun I guess its ok.  No weapon balance at all. Its World of Assault RIFLES. As if a 247 would cut you in half, or a shot gun wouldnt take you in one shot regaurdless.. its the same song and dance because this is for COD dweebs..."
16843,"So, I downloaded this after completely losing my sense of humor with ""Dirty Bomb"".  This game is much more fun.  Just been playing TDM for now but even that is more enjoyable than any mode in Dirty Bomb.  I have noticed though that hit detection can be a bit off, but not so much for me that it detracts much from the game.  A solid B-game shooter. Gift boxes are given out quite frequently and there are multiple modes of payment, both in game and with real money, to advance your character and arsenal."
16844,pretty good free fps
16845,"Decent Game, whiny kids ruin the game. Admins are catering to the todlers playing the game by adding a crouch stamina system so people cant teabag, I'll play a different game if this system is actually added...... that includes the 5 bucks a month I spend in game going to another game
"
16846,"This game is good , try to make it better.
Work on players movement and actions and shooting."
16847,"It’s been a long time since a free FPS game got me hooked like this (since Arctic Combat if someone remembers it). It’s in EA but I’m really enjoying it thus far and the fact that it isn’t at all P2W with any skins and characters being purely cosmetic makes it even better. Hopefully the game gets even better because it has some things that need to be polished of course. Give it a try, it’s really fun and you have nothing to lose since it’s free!"
16848,YOU CAN GET FREE MONEY FROM THIS FREE GAME
16849,помесь rss и кс
16850,It's Free To Play And I'm loving it
16851,"Too much like CS:GO, not enough like Battlefield and the old CoD I remember."
16852,A free cs:go
16853,I truly like this game.Its graphics r pretty good and also this game is like a prequel to CS GO.it provides practice of shooting skills.i highly recommend it as based on its free to play status its pretty good!
16854,Good and interesting game. Reminds me of BlackShot.
16855,"Simple to play, excellent movement and gunplay, and i have yet to meet a cheater who isnt discovered by the system."
16856,reminds me of blackshot
16857,Yo f squadack
16858,"very good. A meld of two great games CS:GO and Call of Duty. I would definitly get this if you are low on cash, however paying for CS:GO will yield a better gameplay experience."
16859,i bought a charater and have not recieved i am very un happy wuth this game this game robs u u buy something and it doesnt show up in invatory
16860,Very good game! Not like CS GO. BS is all out war. Worth a shot!
16861,"So we were testing f2p games with my buddy since pubg servers were down and not yet new season for Siege. First impression was horrible when we jumped to TDM gamemode with small map and insane grenade spam. After disapointment we took demolition 5v5 and that was where this game shines! I higgly suggest you to test this, but ffs dont play TDM, it´s cancer.

It´s not P2W and has one of the best f2p policy out of all free games.

Its in alpha currently and it needs some changes/improvements. First of all i want to see some kind of ranked system, it brings a reason to come back and improve you skills. Secondly sniper accuracy while moving needs to be reduced. Thirdly some maps have spots that doesnt have any sound if you are walking and it feels really weird. We need killcam! Even tho i havent seen any obvious hackers it would help to see if some1 is hacking.

Overall i would give this solid 7.5/10 and i can see this game growing and not just dieng like many others. Best f2p shooter i have played."
16862,"Modern Warfare is it you? I would say its an MW Clone. You even have ,,Killstreaks'' (Pointstreaks here) I FUCKING LUV IT. Thank you so much for bring me back my MW Feeling. I missed it^^

Hey you, you missed MW too? Come in!
Its no pay 2 win. Was on the first Place on TDM with the starting Weapon. 
TdM Maps too small but the other modes are great!

I will buy something for support. Thnx guys!!!!!"
16863,"Great fps game. I enjoy this title alot, as said by others it's quite easy to learn but very hard to master. You die in an instant and that makes for fast and tactical gameplay. I'm not a big fan of the tdm games but the 5v5 demolition is genius fun.

Try it, its free"
16864,"""I'm Commander Knuckles, and this is my favorite game on Steam."""
16865,"I haven't played much, so I can't say much either.
The graphics look cool, nothing new, but for a free game, it's really good.
It performs really well, and I believe it's a good free alternative to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or Rainbow Six: Siege.
The gameplay and mechanics are, for the most part, just like CS in most modes. 
It's not pay-to-win, wich's like, really good and makes it a really good point for playing it. 
In general I find it ""over detailed"". What I mean is that well, the maps have far too much visual shit that isn't really necessary, and even so, the game fails to give a sense of realism to the maps, you basically won't feel like that location could be a real one. It also has a HUD with far too much info, and I legit got kinda lost when I first opened the game, and it took me some to realize how to even get into a match.
But overall, it's a good game for a free one, and if you like fps in general, give this one a try.
"
16866,"Fun game if youre not getting Melted by wizards with the AK and High Ping. 

Dont even bother with TDM, maps are way too damn small.

Ive been playing mostly 5v5 demolition, and its pretty fun. Basically SnD if youre a Cod guy.

so far 7/10 because it's not pay to win, but there are some things i would change. Try it out though, its fun for a F2P game."
16867,gud gam
16868,"Ok game.

Simple, fun and free. It's the kind of game you'd play if you did not have the money for CSGO or another high prestige FPS, but wanted to play an MMOFPS. Plus, it can run on realtivley bad computers, which is good.
4/5."
16869,"Constant toxic players, No means of reporting. 50% of the players are cheating in one way or another."
16870,"Game was very good and well made, but a little hard in the beginning."
16871,how is this this easy
16872,"This game is very busy.
It has many cheaters and never ban them.
But it is possible that you have never cheated got ban
It has very busy servers that make your experience of this game annoying
Trust me, unfortunately I have 1800 hours of time play in this game"
16873,"This game is not horrible, it does noyhing offensive, its just really, really dry. The gun machanics are bad, and the game really has nothing unique about it. And the maps are borring and uninspired. If you like the kind of game where you spawn and kill a guy and then get shot in the back, and rinse and repeat, you will love this game. But to me it is just borring."
16874,"Nice, tight, fast paced shooter with a decent selection of weapons, maps and game modes.

Each weapon plays a bit differently, but from what I've seen no one is better than the others and the mahjor differnece is personal prefference and play style.

Character customization is limited, with a few skins avalibe for real money (naturally, I bought one of an attractive Asian woman in booty shorts and thigh-highs. Yes, I am a pervert, get over it).

Like with a lot of F2P shooters, you can get weapons withn usage limits (timers) but all permanement weapons are unlocked via in-game currency, with some special skinned ones going as MTXs.

Game is quick to pick up, bnut I wish it'd remember my prefferences for silencer/laser on/off because as it stand, every time you die it resets both to OFF. Not a huge deal, but still. Another minor grips is how absurdly low the game's default mouse sensativity is. Starting at a 5 is just god awful.

Worth a try? I say yes."
16875,WTF IS THAT SHIT
16876,"It's AVA, Crossfire and all those too similar clones all over again. But the power of hype or some dark hidden power made this one stand out. 
It's free so take 1.3 hours of your time and find out. A youtube video is faster, even more fun.

I should add the terrible amateurish choice to throw BattlEye to the mix. Now the game never lauch because BattlEye doesn't like VPN clients like Foriclient, VmWare and the like.

To both, developers and BattlEye people: Some of us need those programs to run your servers from where you run your shady stupid game or shady stupid anticheat program.
Get your ass to work and make a proper anticheat implementation.

1/10   (BattlEye, running from Battlegrounds, doesn't even block the same programs. Disgusting)"
16877,Its warface
16878,"Its a Really good Game to waste your time on!

it has alot of pros!

Good Gameplay!

Free stuff everyday!

Events are always there to keep u busy!

So download and enjoy the game :)"
16879,"Simple yet extremly enjoyable.
This is a very well executed attempt at a low budget CoD.
Gameplay is simple enough and doesn't over do it like the recent CoD games.
Fast paced and action packed.
Highly recommend. High replay value. Easy to hop on and off when time is limited."

free = an easy 10/10 rotten tomatoes."
16889,"Graphics are better than cs and potato pcs can still run it at ultra graphic. Takes up lesser space than csgo and still has many fun gamemodes, also has very little hackers unlike the shitstorm of hackers in CSGO. Best thing about this game, its free."

16902,"This game is absolute garbage.. Matchmaking is worst ive ever seen, in ""plant/defuse the bomb"" mode ur team is full of random ppl vs CLAN (who didnt get, what does it mean - its good organized team, most of them using VoIP), ranks not even close to be balanced (always put u in team that have low ranks), hackers at every step, recorded and reported atleast 2 of them (tired of doing this s**t), most of these autists still playing, and devs not giving a single f*** about it. Worst part is sure ping to the servers - can go to unreal 20000ms (!!!), maintenance everyday and every second making ur moves only by teleporting. Another super (nope) feature of this game is FATAL SHOTS, idk wtf is this, but for some ppl its random, for others its like every shot. Why is even implemented, huh?
Community here is toxic about 99.9%, there is no teamplay, only k/d fappers or clans that cant play special mode for them called ""CLAN MATCH"", coz here they can get f***ed up real good. 

Summary: If u some sort of masochist then this game is great gift for u."
16903,DIS IS DA SECOND BEST GAM IN DA WOLD

16905,"Similar to CS; and it even does some things better.

Black Squad is more casual, though (e.g. no voice chat). Which can be a good thing, too.
The micro-transactions are not too intrusive, either. Definitely worth a shot."

Makes zero sense when I can record myself getting point-blank shots to people's chests and dealing less than half their health in damage with the KSG - for the other to shoot me with the standard assault rifle and deal more than half my health in damage with one bullet. 

Fucking infuriating."
16916,"good grafics good cuality
"
16917,One of the best free games
16918,it's areally good game its really good if you dont have a great computer! i reallt recommend it if you like cs-go and cod combined!
16919,"A much much better version of CS:GO. The only reason its not more popular is because people have spent major bucks on CS:GO and they feel like they lose a lot by giving up CS:GO for Black Squad. Its well worth the switch. 

Way Less cheaters then CS:GO. It has Battleye support. Cheaters are activly banned. and not just create a new account ban. Its a HWID/IP/account  ban. There is no making a new steam account and coming back like they do on CS:GO

Other thoughts:
You can easily get any weapon you want without paying real money. Your mostly just going to pay money here for Cosmetic reasons.

Cons:
The same thing that plagues every online Shooter. People with bad ping from other regions coming into your region and wrecking a smooth gameplay experience.  Would be nice if the region locked the game.

100% recommend this game. I wish I started playing it sooner."
16920,"Nice game,fun to play(speciali for people who love to get BIG K/A/D scors

16921,"i love this game 😍 and still playing  but 😭 it's 💀RIP GAME by developers and need 🚨 major fixes 🚨 but  RIP developers can't even make a good skin for weapons 
⭐ 1940 hours in the game 
⭐all achievements  
there is why >>>!!!
it was amazing  in the early access version ,,,after first update after early access they change the game mechanics .....recoil ,,,hitbox,,,,smoke,,,,nade,,,, no reg ,,, sniper quick scoop ,,,,matchmaking and competitive season becomes available for party made of 5 players one of them cheat and 4 of them boosted  
fps is okay 👍

16925,"One of the best F2P shooters out there.
NOT PAY TO WIN AT ALL. Anyone who says that, is completely idiot.
You can get any weapon with ingame currency. 
There aren't any super OP weapons. Each works differently, got different spray pattern, you just need to learn how to control it.
Battle Match is my favorite mode, but it should have more maps. There are only 3 available for now.
It looks decent enough, allthough it could use some optimization.

For a free, early access FPS game i'm really quite impressed.
-Graphics are good
-Gameplay is smooth and has fair recoil control
-Many guns to choose from
-Addicting
-Buying guns with the gold/medals you earn by lvling up

The only thing that I think lacks:
-Having higher ping than someone really affects gameplay, and while there is only one server for NA, you may just have a constant 100 or 60 or even 20 ping. But then again, this is in early access. Still impressed with the game
-There are guns that are better that require a lot of medals (you get them by ranking up) and purchasing medals with irl money can have a pay to progress feel, but I don't believe there is a pay to win because you can play good with the starter guns."
16946,"fun as fuck if you like fast pace shooters, reminds of gunZ"
16947,Very good game. At first I hesitate like every other free to play game... But I actually enjoyed my time on this. I will continue to play.
16948,"To be honest, I dont even know why I downloaded this game. It looks like crap even in the ""trailers"", and it is crap. 
Its like Cs:Go and CoD got a baby and it came out r e t a r d e d.
 
Dont waste space on ur computer for this."
16949,cool
16950,"Nice game, not that bad, i would reccomend it only to who doesn't have money for a good pc and COD, because this is it is: COD free. Nice graphics, lots of weapons and it is not P2W. Overall good but i don't really play it much because i prefer other games."
16951,"Good but could improve better.
So far got 2 things to share,
1. I want fast reloading or getting the silencer in. Which I think of sleight of hand perk.
2. Big and more map needed.
Overall, I do recommend it since it is Free and growing community.

"
16952,"pros- 
more unique than most f2p fps

cons-
seems like the server population is low"
16953,"So far so good. Not exactly familiar with Asian FPS games, but this game feels very responsive. Similar to CS:GO but with more pizzazz. More *POP*. Hit sounds are loud. Colors are bright. Lots of blood. Everything is easy to see. Fast paced. Aim and reaction time are crucial. 

However there is some awkward spelling. Strange semi-intuitive elements to the UI. But it's not too difficult to grasp. It becomes automatic once you learn it, like most other games. I have never been hyped about a F2P game before, but this one does pretty well. I hope that it improves and gets better because it's definitely fun."
16954,A very decent game brings back the memory of early cod days just love this game .
16955,"Fast paced and a lot of fun to play. Frequent sales ingame make it easy to purchase new items , although they aren't  too costly to begin with.Community is surprisingly NOT toxic...a first for me. Overall a fun FPS game. Totally Recommended!!"
16956,"I cant see the player's name in the game , its hard for me to differentiate enemies and friendly. Pls get it fixed asap. thank you"
16957,"i think this game is over looked by alot of people, its alot of fun and very well maintained"
16958,"are you kidding me ??? 115$ BOX not a thing...f.uck......haizzzz ,i'm not fine"
16959,"I've had So much fun in this game. Some people have better guns but its easy to get them since just loggin in every day gives you the currency to buy them. Also just doing decent in a match gets you plenty of points. 
However after a few days playing I ran into ""Them""  The cheaters.... A few games in I suddenly started being killed repeatedly by one or two players and could not get points or kills. Suddenly people with 50 Kills to 3 Deaths started dominating the matches. Truns out ESP (can see your outlines through walls) clients are easy to find. And a Few sites for Aimbots and such turned up as well. This is't the Devs fault, I understand that its out of their control. However with cheating being such a common thing in online games the line that sepparates good from bad devs get very clear. 
I wont  condem the devs but as far as I can see. 
They 
dont 
care.
There is no report feature
They expect you to ""record"" and ""screenshot""  and find the cheaters for them. 
Getting community help is never a bad thing, But using this as a only line of defense to keep the game fun and fair is not how you regualte a game enviroment. 
Conclusion.
Try the game out, its actually very easy once you get sensitivty right. But dont spend any money on the In-Game prchases until they got control of the cheating situation. 
If you see a cheater do your best to get a screenshot if you want and find a new server. Make sure you note the names so you can ask the lobby leader to kick them. But in my experences the chat windo is too quick to get a word in and they will probably just start the next round if they were on the winning team."
16960,Good game
16961,Me is pro
16962,Besh game evah!!!
16963,Good Game i recommend this game
16964,"My time in war has given my adrenal glands prosthetics. Permanent adrenaline.
"
16965,Best game :3
16966,how do i change my name?
16967,"Probably the scummiest form of free to play i've seen in a while. 
Its fun when you have the good guns, but you essentially have to pay for them. 
The UI is terribly clunky and hard to navigate.
The kill sounds are super satisfying, but thats about the best part of the game."
16968,"This game is very well designed being a free to play one. I enjoyed the gamemodes and I don't know why. But getting a kill feels really satisfying. I don't like how it takes so long to kill an enemy with body shots, but you get a kill on someone with 1 to 2 headshots... Great game!"
16969,Just say no to 1995 graphics and game play. This game is nowhere as good as BF3 and I HATE that game. Movement is stiff.  Good thing it was free because that's what it's worth.
16970,good game
16971,KILL KILL SOME ONE WITH AK47
16972,tang ina mo
16973,One of the best F2P games ever with good graphics.
16974,good game
16975,"Overall a good game, not as complex and competitive as CS:GO but certainly worth giving a try, a good free alternative. Very reminiscent of AVA and Cross Fire if you've tried it.

Only thing bringing it down is server being unresponsive like when trying to redeem rewards from inbox.

16976,hgg
16977,"i love this game
my suggestion is just download the game and enjoy it
you don't need to buy anything in this game just improve your skills
but It's worth it to buy something for just helping developer"

16982,Fun game for it being free and hit reg is better than csgo.
16983,Cyka russian fgt greetz
16984,Is good game
16985,"This game is all pros. Cant really find anything wrong with the game. Hackers get kicked quick, wait times are short, no p2w, multiple game types, meet new friends from this game. It really reminds me of CS:GO but with realistic hit boxes and less annoying people. Great game. Keep it up devs."
16986,"What a master pice of a game.
For a free game lot of fun better then most overpaid games 
Recomend to all who like fps games."
16987,many hackers . please take the action
16988,"Most Awesome Game Ever Seen <3
Good Graphics.
Many Players.
And Good Game Modes."

16992,good and free game :)
16993,CoD and CS:GO mix
16994,"This game is fantastic to say the least, it has been said that it's like cs:go on steriods and i can't disagree. The gameplay is very smooth and relies heavily on hipfire like in counter-strike and doesn't have any pay to win options. There is a slight skill cap to where more experienced players may appear to be sketchy but cheating is very rare. Being a free game you would expect there to be many glitches/bugs but this game seems to have very little to none, that being said if you're interested in games like counter-strike but don't want to pay the money this is defintely a very good game to turn to. The community is small but decently friendly with the occasional toxic players, although many players even on NA servers only seems to speak Spanish and do not know any English coupled with high ping due to their location being outside of the server region. The only other complaint i have is the rank system isn't complete and skips some ranks here and there. With all that being said i love the game and have been addicted ever since i started playing and i don't plan to stop anytime soon."
16995,Best game ever
16996,"Tthis game is soo broken.  Until they fix it, i wouldn't even bother.  Someone needs to post a How To video for the cheats in this game cause it seems like there are some badass cheats for this game lmao. Just sayin xD"

17013,I LOVE THIS GAME :D..............but too much pay to win.
17014,"Overall a great game from when i started. Gunfights are responsive and fast paced. Everything great from a F2P first person shooter.

But i cannot recommend the game right now due to its current state of the game because of CHEATERS. No permanent way to combat them. No report system embeded in game, you need to email a ticket directly to the support team with a video proof for a manual ban and that is the only way to report them. Battle eye is just a decoration that doesnt do anything.

Cheating is killing the game RN. I doubt that they can fix this and turn this game around. I cannot see the game flourish in the future. Pro Black Squad lost support due to a scandal that they handled poorly. Content creators are losing interest one by one.

Great game to be honest but ruined by cheats and poor mangement decisions"
17015,cool! :)
17016,Good game... when it actually fucking works properly
17017,"The game itself is enjoyable, and you can earn ingame currency yourself so no p2w going on; HOWEVER, the servers can be terrible and unresponsive, more OFTEN than not, which really kills it big time."
17018,"nice :) 
😉"
17019,"Im not recommending it.

-Its pay to win game (you have to pay real money for better guns)
-Bad graphics
-Bugs
-Tryhards
-Boring"
17020,"game is broken , main menu you cant even click anything just remains unresponsive. please fix this asap."
17021,"Good for killing time,maybe will become/is already p2w"
17022,"Looks like they made money they want and dont care anymore entire week glitches lags and more cheaters every day 
devs dont respond and most likely not working at any permament solution its just dead already was good and funn but better look for something else"
17023,"The tutorial is ridiculious but if you've played games similiar you'll get a hang of it fairly qucikly. The interface is still confusing; felt like an idiot trying to locate everything and how to upgrade. Actually, I still haven't quite figured out how to upgrade. It just happened by chance and I have no idea how or where that happened. I've mainly played TDM as refresher but where Black Squad shines is in Battle/Detroy mode, objective, destroy the enemies base while getting shot over and over and over again. As a result, you get pissed, but do the same attempt repeatedly as if you didn't learn your lesson, lol. Best Free FPS title? I'd say so, better than most AAA Titles I've played that have been recently released. Sometimes it can be a bit wonky, just be patient. Also, very important, it does a very good job placing players in the same match with similiar rank, making the playing field fair."
17024,n u t t m a c h i n e
17025,token thumbs up
17026,"this game should be called nibba squad tbh ples change literally unplayable

ok no"
17027,"THIS SUCKS.
IT LOADS ETERNALLY. IT CRASHES EVERY GAME AND ON EVERY ACTION DONT EVEN LOOK AT THE SHOP BECAUSE IT WILL CRASH.
HOW IS THIS PIECE OF GENERIC CRAP EVEN ON MOSTLY POSSITIVE REVIEWS.
It look nice tho.
Bur really it plays really bad."
17028,nice game
17029,"Whenever I try to purchase something from the store in the game, the game freezes, I can still move my mouse but I can't select anything. Please fix this."
17030,"The game is just flatout boring, everytime i try to buy a gun or receive some crate or whatever it just freezes and i cant 
do SHIT this game aint good.The graphics are good but the mecanics are horrendous,sure i only just played for 40 mins but thats enough to take a desicion.
Conclusion : THIS GAME IS  

 C L A P P E D"
17031,the best!
17032,looks good but just crashes for me and would it kill you too turn the volume for starting players.
17033,*better and a much more fun game than CSGO.* is true but I've wasted so much money on your cases. It should be buffed to give more so that people would spend more. I wont spend money on this game anymore because of the odds you give in the cases.
17034,"Very fun, played on other accounts and going to be forward to put some hours into this game. No toxic teammates like cs"
17035,This game in one of the best games ever but can you plzz add more maps
17036,"Boring, repetitive and extremily simple."
17037,It's really interesting and challenging. Would recommend it for sure.
17038,For the haters.
17039,"Really buggy game and always lagging unless you're near the city where their servers are hosted at. Guns are so unbalanced and the hit boxes, oml, the most terrible shit i've ever seen. worse than combat arms"
17040,J'espere il sera esport un jour!
17041,"Really enjoying relaxing to this shooting game. Having not clocked many hours in CSGO I feel like the learning curve will be long, but fun! No lag, no dying around corners! A really solid game."
17042,server performance is kinda poor at this point in time
17043,just one imaging its amazin
17044,"after 200hrs of playing i have mostly enjoyed my time. The game is great a fresh breeze from CSGO and very fun. My 1 complaint is that ever since launch updates have become less and less helpful we need example a,b and c fixed and they were within a week now it seems every update is just to push more skins wish it wasnt the case but it is game is great but they let there esports scene die by promising esl partnership and still dont have it overall great game but just a cash grab"
17045,"It is very nice and just fun to play. but i get money very slowly i would like that u get a little more money from a match
"
17046,"So with almost 20 hours in game i must say it is alot more entertaining than cs.
Thank you developers i have found a fps game i will play for years to come."
17047,"Superb fun! Especially after 11 cans of Carling lager.
"
17048,the old maps were better but im not going to complain since its free
17049,"I enjoy this game alot , in my opinion is better then Csgo ,   feelsgood !"
17050,"if u want rly good action shooter, dont even think to play in this. It's so bad mechanic"
17051,too many grenade fuck
17052,One of the best free to play FPS shooter games .
17053,Full of cheaters. Uninstalled
17054,"Good
(if you play with powerful weapons my advice is to TAP TAP TAP)"
17055,"Best Free to play FPS game on Steam and I think it is inspired by the Call Of duty Modern Warfare 2 if u r a fan of cod Series u should play this game 
Need low system req. and Controls are very easy"
17056,"A good game, simply put."
17057,good game
17058,"PAY 2 WIN BU||$H17!

THERE ARE TONS OF REVIEWS SAYING THAT THIS GAME ISN'T PAY 2 WIN AND IT'S COMPLETELY SKILL BASED. YEAH, RIGHT!
THE PRICE OF THE GUNS ARE RIDICULOUSLY HIGH! Even after playing like 20 matches, you won't be able to afford a pistol! YES, A FRIGGING PISTOL!!!

If you don't have a job, a life, or whatever, go ahead and enjoy grinding your aπ$e off.
If you do have a life BUT can't afford buying CS:GO or whatever, stay TF away from this."
17059,Pretty sad how there are few players in the servers and having hackers in the game as well which makes the game fustrating. There needs to be a report button or something to ban those players like come on. Other than that the game is pretty fun imo but ugh fix the ping!
17060,Do you want to play COD and/or CS:GO but do not have any money? Well this game is for you! It`s not as poished as the others but it`s FREE and the missions are nice. Good job NS STUDIO.
17061,Best free game by far... more better then cs:go..
17062,"Cons:
-Degenerate map designs from 1993.
-Weapon imbalance makes some completely unusable.
-Graphics from 2006, give or take.
-Repetive sound effects. Feels like every single death (10 per second) are all the same yelp.

Cheap. I'm a huge fan of fps games, but they didn't even try on this one. Clearly the devs couldn't care less if it was a good game AND THEN tried to get your money."
17063,A Dope game.
17064,"Boring game!! Lagged so much, freezed up, just sucked in general. I wouldn’t recommend this game."
17065,"Sooooo a review about this game:
At least by my 5 hour exp i found it not to be bad at all, just a little bs about how every time i die people lack the heath loss i was expecting from a AK-12 headshot neither from a spray of shotgun pellets, basically the strategy on this game in casual gameplay involves the map and the gun you´re using, mostly all rifles involve pre firing corners until you hit someone and using nades on the enemy spawn, if you got the 1250(or 1000 can´t remember exactly) medals needed for a P90 do it was you usually do on CS, run arround the map outplaying enemies positions and never stop moving or you will get one tapped by a sniper. Lil later found out that the game actually had a logical recoil on guns since i had found more useful to burst fire most weapons.
It´s a F2P COD+CS:GO game mostly, not much p2win but i recommend you expend time griding a M4 and a AK47, they are pretty good at least by my perspectives"
17066,I've been playing this game for quite a long now and I can say its awesome. The map textures are really awesome. It gives a couter strike like feel but in a much larger scale. Would definitely suggest this game for anyone who can not afford to buy CS even if you can afford this game worth a shot. I started playing less CS:GO and more Black Squad. Keep up the good work devs. Thanks a lot.
17067,Knock off.
17068,I like this game
17069,This game made me realize i wouldnt even play CoD if it were free.
17070,Download
17071,"Really one of the most solid F2P FPS that isn't P2W out there. 

-Cash items are basically better looking skins, but all the weapons can be bought with in-game currency.

-The TDM & Destruction maps are very linear and the gameplay fast, but well paced.

-The Demolition mode offers a decent selection of maps and tactical gameplay.

-I haven't actually played an Assassination match, so I can't say much about that.

-Excellent graphics and so far I've not experienced any lag playing on their NA server.

Overall it has something for everyone and it's completely free...and that's completely mind boggling."
17072,Great for a free-to-play game
17073, full of cheaters.

17077,its engoyable and playful for its price
17078,this is a 10 out of 10 rating. this game is a good first person shooter game.
17079,i really like this game . it has big veriouty of guns and there is alot of people . this game is amaizing . :D
17080,"games like this, and warframe, give me faith in the future of free to play. this game is free, isnt pay to win, you can any weapon permanent, for free, if you simply play, or even log on and receive your daily login rewards, if you really wanted to be lazy. currently, at the time of this review, there is a 50% off sale on all items, aside from a few that just released, which are 20% off, and packages, which are 20% off, and the crates for gambling on skins, which is the only item im aware of that doesnt have a sale applyed to it. the reason i mention this is, they put the items on sale that where for ingame currency as well as the ones for cash currency, and didnt make this sale simply about them making money off of their game, which is all too common with f2p games. this is also why i mentioned warframe, they are one of the only other f2p games im familiar with that could very easily go a ""p2w"" route, despite it being a pve game, but they choose to sell cosmetics, and time saving/function type items. f2p gaming needs more games/companys like this.

on a side note, i do have 1 minor complaint. while im very happy with the actual feel of the game/gunplay, because i never seem to have problems with bullet registry, and my ping always seems to be fine, what im not as thrilled about is the less then amazing selection of modes/maps. we have tons of guns, not an amazing amount, but decent enough, and nowhere near enough map/mode selection in this game. one other small thing, that i like, but also dislike, for 1 reason, is the lack of sprint. while having no actual sprint is nice from a balance standpoint, and keeps the games pace feeling more relaxed, and predictable, i am a fan of fastpaced shooters, as well, and more to the point, one of my favorite modes is capture the flag. and im trying to imagine capture the flag with the ""sprint"" sort of system thats in the game, where you hold a button to pull out your knife, for slightly faster movement speed, and it seems like it wouldnt work. that being said, how the game is now, it does feel good, for the most part, im simply not used to playing without the ability to sprint. or without a large selection of modes, either."

17092,"Things that lead to Black Squad's decline:
• Closed steam market
• Removed perm shop items (now in boxes)
• Removed perm comp/playtime rewards
• Limited comp to solo play
• No new maps/weapons in the last few updates
• Removed bs coin rewards from daily missions
• All time low active player count
• Still seeing hackers from time to time
• Cross server play is horrible with the big ping differences (but is needed with such a small playerbase)
• Removed gold random box
• Legit players being banned
• Unreasonable game support (copy paste responses or ignored)
• Bad chat system (plagued the game since the beginning)
• Long time players have nothing good to spend their medals and gold on (there were a few boxes but the chance of a good item was way too low)
• Personal point: removed ability to do accurate no-scopes/jumpshots ;C

Having played the game for a long time it's sad to see it go down like this. The community is very vocal about the things they feel are wrong with the game, yet all these points are brushed aside. Even with the player base continuing to shrink, no positive changes are being made. Lost players are also unlikely to come back after having moved on."
17093,"Awesome game, I aways find players and it's very fun.
Best part is: it's not pay to win."
17094,"Actually I don't like multiplayer games.But I like first person shooter games.

If you are bored csgo (like me) And looking for a new excitement, don't hesitate to own this one.

It's also free btw :)))"
17095,"i love this gme so much and i recomment checking it out 
game mods 
team death match
assasination
demolation 5v5
demolation 8v8

some gamemods need to be added to the game
melee only
prop hunt 
and the only secondary weapons

also when you going to add armor because there is only the flak jacket and non else  i would love to see it"
17096,"Well , the game is f2p game with good graphics , good stuff . But in terms of involvingreal money in this i highly suggest that u only buy dlc's , the Random Bullet  Crates are rigged couldn't get what i want when i spend 300% more than my friendeho got the skins. Well my advise if u buy bullets don't spoil it on crates"

17098,Good game. Reminds me of CS style.
17099,"Coming back to this game after 4-5 years and it has just gotten worse.
The game when I played in 2017-2018 was fun, a bit P2W and a few cheaters here and there but it has just gone downhill since then.

Cheaters in almost every match, knowing they can cheat because the developers are too busy pushing out more P2W content and female skins with little to no clothing with large breasts that bounce at the slightest movement in hopes that their foreign child fanbase will steal their parents card and buy the skins as an attempt to get the most money they can out of them before they also realize the game is full to the brim of cheaters & server issues and quit to play a better game."
17100,Downloaded the game with 3 friends and every single one of us had the same problem with either a black screen or it kicks you when you confirm your password. 10/10 game crash simulator.
17101,"- free amazing game and i never had any problem on it until now.
- allot of weapons and characters
- actually there is something i love it in this game that you don't have to pay money mean charge real money for it
     you can play and level up your account without money 
     and you can buy skins and more weapon if you want but that will not make you stronger.
- something else this game have new Gameplay , new Technic something different on it .
- last thing that made me impressed they respect players reports and suggestions . \
finally i really recommend this game for everyone 
try it and see what i'm talking about

17106,sweet game to replace csgo during times im fed up with cs.
17107,super awesome game :D
17108,A very nice Shooter and its free :^]
17109,"Black Squad is DECENT. Lowkey, it  reminds me of CrossFire. That other Counter-Strike rip off title. Even the menu has some similarities. Graphics are pretty good. Guns are pretty balanced and have their different roles for different players. The physics as well are nice. 

My only problems on this game are; the settings are very confusing. There's too much BS in every setting. I mean who needs 3 different presets of sensitivity. The default key binds can't be cleared, which sucks when you try to simplify your controls. The gun play is not so good either. The way the models move and react to getting hit or shot really needs to be overhauled. There's too much randomness happening in and out of duels. Although you do have fun playing, it still can't make up for the frustration it brings up when you're in a gun fight.

If the developers consider these things too be fixed, then I'd give this game a higher score. As of the moment, I can't recommend it at all. But who knows, maybe things will be different next time. 

5/10 Rating as of Februrary 14, 2018."
17110,"This game is pretty solid. At first it irked me that certain items, like grenades had a limited lifespan, but between the rewards, and the promotion bonus, ontop of match gold, its not much of a problem, even for guys like me that consistently rank lower on the scoreboard. The community atmosphere isnt as toxic as I thought it was going to be, but there are the exceptions. 

The graphics, while not being the industry standard, are more than adequate to give me an ""immersed"" feeling, with a 5 year old machine. 

Weapon selection is pretty decent, and  there are more than enough maps and players to keep the game experience varied, and challenging. 

Its a damn fine game as it is, for the price, and theres still more to come, if i've read the community hup correctly. 

10/10"

17116,"This game isn't good, and here's reasons why.

*graphics are bad
*animations are cheesy
*guns and knives are overpowered
*explosion effects are awful
*the default settings and controls aren't meant for FPS games(thankfully you can change that)
*There's not many things to do(then again, it is early access)
*PVP takes a solid 3 seconds until one of you ends up dead
And I'm hurt to see the trailer, then play the game to see it's absolutely unrealistic(as it states in the description of the game) And I'd suggest playing COD, CS:GO or TF2, because this game is disappointing to me."
17117,"As someone with 1.5k hours in CS:GO, I find this game to be more fun than CS. So far the game seems good, I am worried if there will be a cheater problem like CS, especially since the game is free, but am not sure if it is a problem or not yet. So far, I would rate 9/10."

17124,"There is something abou this game that I am enjoying. When my friends ask, I cannot put my finger on it. It reminds me a lot of COD: MW2 a bit, but I've played similar FPS's recently and did not enjoy them. Some of the mechanics still need polishing, grouping with friends needs some work, already toxic players abound, and some of the maps are way too small...but I am still enjoying it. Graphics are okay, a nice range of weapons (some are behind a pay wall), a few different game modes, and very fast paced gameplay. It is F2P, so no harm in giving it a try."
17125,The game is very good for being only in early access game and hardly ever laggs with not that good computer.
17126,funny and free game lol
17127,"Amazing game for a free game.
There are times when you will rage out because of good skilled players in this game lol.

Pros :
- Good for a free to play.
- No pay to win aspect at all - Paid guns are only for skins like csgo,
- Dont need high end computer to play this game since graphics are decent but not that great.
- Demolition mode is AMAZING ! SO COMPETITIVE and EXICITING even if its not a clan match. ( Unlike CS:GO you dont have to worry about being in a competitive mode to have some fun . Dont need to worry about enemy specatator view like CS:GO's casual mode ).
- No VOIP, for me personally this is a pro because you dont have to worry about other players spamming the mic like other games. ( If you want voice chat, just join a clan & use their discord)
- Great gaming community. Most people I came across are friendly & mature. 
- Developers give out in game freebies which is awesome.
- Bot mode to pratice your one tap headshots.

Cons:
- Needs more maps, especially for demolition. Small map choice makes the game repetative. 
- Needs custom game match with fully custom weapon choice ( Currently no pistol only mode )
- Sometimes you get shot and killed even after you run behind cover.
- Getting a quick match might sometimes take a bit long ( May be im just impatient lol )
- No ability to kick players in game 
- Crouch spams

Verdict:

Amazing fun game free of cost. Win-Win situation. Highly recommended.

17132,"The game is like a mix-up of Call of Duty and Counter strike: global offensive. Blending CS: GO's formula with CoD's fast paced combat and shooting. It's very easy to pick up and play thanks to it not having CS: GO's shooting system or budget mechanic, while it makes the demolition matches have a bit less depth it makes it a whole lot easier for newer people to enjoy the game and not missing like a scrub like in CS: GO.
The matches themselves are very enjoyable and i don't experience any lag because of my hardware. The problems are though that the servers sometimes start lagging and everyone starts to pop around but that doesn't happen often for me.

The biggest complaint that i have is the games tendency to freeze while in the menu which leads too me having to close it through the task manager and then not being able to login again because ""i'm already logged in"" because i didn't close it properly, this is very annoying as it freezes quite often for me. Good thing that it's early access and hopefully the problems will be fixed soon."

NZ.... Dont bother. no local servers, and lowest ping was about 300. so you die before you even see the other players half the time.
"
17144,bruh
17145,"Oh dear god. This is so bad. Playing through the trial in this ""Absolutely not Pay to Win"" completely pay to win game gives glimmers of the just so last gen garbage that comprises this title.

Remember mice with actual balls in them ? Black squad does, and they give you the full experience of having 2 years worth of lint and sweat mud tacked onto the rollers.

Horrid writing, 3rd rate movement of models, unbelieveably dated visuals. I mean this looks like it was made with an early quake engine. I apologise to all the mates I'd randomly mentioned this game to.

Not pay to win, but totally pay to win. Buffs, boosts and weapon unlocks are available for cash. Aka Pay to win. Here i was thinking people would buy cosmetics and effects, not actual xp/money buffs. For shame, for shame."
17146,"I really want to like this game. It has good graphics, the sound effects and the blood make getting a kill very satisfying, but a lot of people have problems with direct x or something that makes the game freeze for a half second randomly, and in this game you can die in a split second. Even if that wasn't an issue, the map design (at least for team deathmatch, which is what most people prefer to play) is hilariously bad. Its like me inviting you to play airsoft with me with my brand new amazing guns, then showing up to a storage locker with a few boxes between us. There is a rooftop style map where you literally see the enemies spawn across the gap of the roofs through the windows ~ 50 yards away. The spawn points are permanent, so its the same access to the same 2 or 3 small areas and you get a few seconds of invulnerability when you spawn, and given the rediculously small size of every map (at least in TDM) it promotes camping (and spawn camping) and leaves you with nowhere to go other than maybe 2 different hallways per map. There is even a map where if you go to the hallways on the side of the map it takes you  into the enemy spawn. I still like the game but as i said there is something wrong that makes certain people get split second freeze spikes, and because of that, in a game like this, makes it almost unplayable. The only thing it needs is medium sized maps and smart respawns that arent set in stone so you spawn away from enemies, and are able to actually enjoy using tactics without automatically knowing which tiny hallway the enemies will be standing in. Did i mention grenade spam? Yea, you get a frag and a secondary grenade every time you spawn, and since everyone is running around in a shoe box it gets very obnoxious. I can recoomend this game but they NEED to fix the maps ASAP! Give it a try and ""find this review helpful"" if you agree."
17147,Nice
17148,"In short, this is a poor man's version of Counter-Strike.

Right off the bat, this game looks cheaply made, the visuals may look attracting at first, but once you see the UI and gameplay, its clear that this is either a port of a mobile game, or a game made by college students during game development college.
I won't say the gameplay is bad, but its fairly simple, its very easy to pick up and play, a little too easy.

The tutorial makes it seem like your in for some advanced Metal Gear Solid-esque gameplay, but the game itself plays almost more basic than CS 1.6.

This game also has a lot of design flaws, like how you cant change the settings during the tutorial so you're stuck with extremely low sensitivity. Not to mention the death sound, there's only 1 death sound in the game which you'll hear the entire time and it doesn't sound realistic, it sounds more like an orgasm.
And the voice acting is terrible, the radio operator in the tutorial has no emotion whatsoever, and even combat gameplay sounds unexciting.

But this is an early-access game, so i can forgive it for its current state.

I won't be so harsh on this game, since this game is Free-To-Play, and while there is DLC, you are not obligated to buy anything (i don't believe I've seen any microtransactions neither) so at least this game shoves nothing down your throat.

In conclusion, if you dont have Counter-Strike, or any COD-like shooter, or you have literally nothing to do in your life, then this is the game for you."
17149,The unbalancing of the guns make me sick
17150,"Fun game, especially considering that it is free. However, the community is a bit toxic. Less than 2 hours of playing, I have already been reported by someone for ""aimbotting"". I hope the report system is designed to not ban players just because some salty kids report them when they lose."

17166,"Logins for the first time *Crash*

17167,"A very solid FPS game with some CS:GOish and CoDish aspects. It looks good for the games engine and launcher, which are kinda aged. Sounds are solid, 'Specially when you hear that crack when you get a headshot. Hitboxes are decent with some issues here and there. Besides that its a F2P game with no P2W elements with a decent amount of content if you dont wanna spend any money (you can buy guns with ingame currency anyway, the rest are bought with medals and there are weapon skins that DO NOT make someone pay to win). My only gripe is the map design, especially for TDM. Most of the maps look uninspired for that gamemode but the rest of the maps are highly detailed and despit the iffyness of ports, this one came out quite well and works. Dev team is extremely responsive to feedback and do daily updates to fix issues here and there. Highly recommend this to anyone who loves military shooters."
17168,game is bullshit
17169,It's an amazing game!
17170,This game really surprised me for being a free to play game. It really has the feel of a game to where CSGO and Call of Duty(the good ones) had a baby. The game has great sound And graphics. it also has great gun mechanics. So if you like Call of Duty or CSGO i think you should try this game out.

17180,"Pros:
- Not P2W
- Very visually appealing.

Cons:
- Game is dead and matchmaking is terrible.
- Sniping is awful. You can't move and snipe at the same time or else your shots become extremely inaccurate and don't follow your crosshair. I assume they did this to prevent quickscoping, but it took a lot of fun out of the game and tbh there's not really any point in using snipers since they suck so bad compared to every other gun.
- Map design is ridiculously bad, especially in demolition. Bomb sites are almost next to each other and are practically in the enemy spawn in most maps. A lot of rooms can also only be accessed by one path and require you to sometimes go all the way around the map to access. 
- Practically no English-speaking players. I'm in Northern US, and the only people I get paired with are Mexicans and Ecuadorians. I don't get why, but there is often a language barrier.

I can't recommend this game at all when there are other F2P games that blow this out of the water."

17184,"Obviously I don't have a lot of time on record with this game so take what I say with a grain. Maybe I'll edit this review after I have more time on my record...maybe not.

Before picking this game up I saw the main complaint being map design. After playing this game for about an hour, my main complaint is map design. These are just.....the pits, man. Boring, tiny, uninspired - never mind the spawn camp problem.
But, I wanted a goofy little FPS game to mess around in, t-bag some jokers, get myself t-bagged a lot, and hey, this seems to scratch that itch. I can love this game a lot more if the maps weren't so bland and tiny. Where's the big-team stuff?"

17195,"I've only played 45 minutes of this, and I'm not terribly impressed.

Pro's
I ripped ass in my first and third games, so to all of you that really want to know, no this game is not pay to win. I had the Tar - starter gun, and completely obliterated my first game. The third one I got a Luna skinned - M4 variant with a grenade launcher, and came out 2nd best player. So really this is all down to your own skill, if you're good and learn the maps fast, you'll have a good time.

No one talks, so you can listen to all the footsteps that are coming your way and prepare for that hip-fire headshot.

You have the option to aim down your sights but you're just wasting your time.

The tutorial is jarring and gets the point accross.


Cons

I personally enjoy the freedom of 'fully' rebindable keys, not ""you're stuck with the middle mouse button as your running key and knife"". Maybe I am wrong on that and you can separate them, but having that as the initial layout of movement is an utter joke.

The maps look like they've been made half-cocked where you can easily get spawn trapped if you're not careful.

Same repetitive gameplays as any other game, play counter strike, everyone and their gran has it on some platform and while that isn't free, part of me wishes this game paid me to play it because it is so dull and mandane.

Graphics are kinda meh.


All in all I just wanted a moan because this game really does pale in comparison to many others, I'm not saying you won't enjoy it but, WHO THE FUCK USES THE MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON AS A SPRINT KEY?"
17196,"Well i like the game (now only played a bit) it feels like something is missing. But it is really fun and satisfying to kill! And yes i understand that it is in early access so more of this game will come out. But hey, try it out. It is fun!"

17210,"Can't recommend it. It's a fantastic base to build on but devs are more interested in making skins as a reward that you dont get to keep over developing the game itself. Over the last 6 months there's been 3-4 updates big enough to warrant the devs to think ""exciting"" patch notes are required but they never anything other than ""skin announcements"" (skins you'll get as rewards you dont get to keep).

- There's no actual ranking which means you're 99% likely to play with unskilled players over skilled players.

- Rewards are just on loan, you dont keep anything. If you're lucky enough to get medals it's nowhere near enough to do anything.

- Maps are good but need work for balance, some completely favour team A and some completely favour team B... No maps are in between.

- Gun play needs a lot of work, you can headshot someone 3 times with little to no effect and dies, then in the next round you can drop someone instantly.

- You're not allowed in the actual ranked section... ESEA would probably welcome Black Squad with open arms but they chose to try their own ranked which hasn't worked in the slightest because nobody can play.

9/10 for potential.
4/10 for it's current state."

17215,"probably one of the best free to play shooters ive played....


im a old school gamer, i cant tell you how many hours i had into such games as action quake, unreal tourny and other twitch shooters of the late 90's, and i see alot of that in this

its fast paced, high kill/death count fun

its easy to earn gold to purchase guns, for instance i could get around 1000-1500 gold per game, with your averge purchasable gun costing 40,000-50,000 thousand, so it doesnt take long to get money to buy a new gun

the guns all seem pretty balanced, and nothing at any point feels unfair

if your willing to spend some cash, you can purchase guns with custom skins, but it doesnt make your gun any stronger so its pretty nice the pay to win worry is non-exsistant here


overall i have and do suggest this game,  sure its not a simulated tactical shooter, but it is action packed and fun! check it out!"
17216,"Bad matching system, lose everytime because teams not balanced"
17217,This game is nothing to compare with CSGO. gunfight feeling is very bad.
17218,fake call of duty. Gun fights are not satisfying and isn't really skill based. Mostly dorks running around with a grenade launcher. hf if thats your thing.
17219,what's a CSGO?
17220,"I have played many FPS games in my 40 years. This has to be one of the easiest games to get a headshot in, It really takes away some of the fun for me. I wanna be able to go out there, toe to toe with players and duck, jump, roll and blast them. But no matter how good you are, those damn random headshots will end your killing steak. Maps are not that great. Grenades should not cost in game currency to use. Should come as standard eq. Anyhow, it was fun for about 3 -5 days. Not bad for a free game.  I ONLY recommend it because it is free lol."
17221,"After games like Crossfire, A.V.A., Counter-Strike, etc all got boring, it is a nice feeling to get into a game like this.

Pros:
-Simplicity... not overly complicated... no pay to win (Skinned weapons have no functional advantage)
-Sounds are pretty nice. I like how the splatter sound works with getting a hit.
-Look decent enough. last gen for sure, but still aight. It is no BF1 or anything remotely close, but it works.
-Fast paced, but not overly so. It is a nice balance.
-Easy mapping. The maps are simplistic in design giving no single side a real advantage.

Cons:
-I would at least like SOME gun customization to make a gun my own. Things like scopes and foregrips should be stat changing addons for purchase with in game currency (or skinned for real money). Most ARs have a nade launcher. Boring.
-There is no definitive difference in characters. They all die just as fast as the next one making the only difference the skin and 1 paragraph backstory.
-This last con bugs the fire outa me. Screen pauses/lag at times. Feels like an FPS drop for a 1-1.5 second duration. Enough to get you killed a lot. Now, it is BY FAR not on my end. I have a great internet connection, and an INSANE rig.

Rig: Ryzen 1800x - Strix GTX 1080ti 11gb - 16gb DDR4 3000mhz - m.2 gen 3x4 solid state drive
In short, there is no game I cannot max out under 60fps. This is a game issue."

Black Squad has the same type of style. its quick and fun, fast matches so you never get bored and although I have no friends playing it, it would be a good party game with friends. It looks like it was inspired by counter-strike 

Overall, Its a good game to have a laugh."
17224,This is fun to play and its currancy seems fair
17225,"Cons:
-Game doesn't make sense. Bought a gun that had 30 power and 91 accuracy, bullet spray is terrible and it took 30 rounds to drop a target. Bought a gun that has 35 power and way worse accuracy and the bullet spray is better but still takes tons to kill a target. Very bad design. 
-Got killed numerous times behind walls, the Vsync needs alot of improving
-Cannot equip attachments to any guns, red dot is only good for so long. Would definitely prefer an ACOG sight, but can't get that unless you get it by chance in a crate gun. 
-Snipers are OP!!! One shot wonders where as the AR's may as well be SMG's
-Pay for grenades.....last 1 day and its pay on use. Trash design. 

Pros
-Incredible graphics and seamless movement. Huge improvisations on that behalf.
-Fun for hours if you get a decent crate gun
-Super team friendly game"
17226,Awesome
17227,"Good
"
17228,"The best FPS I’ve played in a long time. Because it was free, I honestly didn’t expect a whole lot. But now I can’t put it down. Far better can Counter Strike. Highly recommend!"
17229,"Here's what i don't like about the game:
-No ingame voice chat.
-The game offers ADS system but no custom sights just stock ones.
-There's no point in ADSing since the hipfire is too good/better.
-Maps are just bad, too manny choke points with advantage for the defending team."
17230,"Pros:

- f2p.
- Not p2w. (Cosmetic purchases only)
- Plenty of gamemodes.
- good player base.
- Runs on Mid-range+ Rigs.  
- a lot of fun guns to use.

Cons:

- Map design, easy to spawncamp.
- No mapvote system.
- Snipers are way to easy to use. 
- lag can be prevelant sometimes.
- No voice chat, will never hear anyone talk. 
- UI can bug out (non-clickable buttons)
- Constant server maintenance

Overall:

- Probably one of the best f2p fps game we are going to get, would recommend atleast checking it out."
17231,It would be nice if it have Oceana Dedicated servers.
17232,"Amazing game. Really like how there's a CS:GO aesthetic with some nice things added to it. Very fun, and could very well be an alternative if you don't have enough money for CS:GO. I've had so much fun so far, and I can't wait until the full release."
17233,"Amazing game!
Animations are super smooth and satisfying.
No bugs encountered thus far with 12 hours
Action packed and unique game-modes/matches
not even counting that this is free 
( BTW micro transaction are there but never is it forced upon you so you can LOVE the game without a hint that its free!!!)"
17234,"Pros:
-FPS
-Free-to-Play
Cons:
-terrible gunplay
-damage models are completely f****d
-recoil is there but completely random
-cannot customize any settings during tutorial (had to set my dpi to 8000 just to turn around)
-gameplay is wonky
-netcode is worse than BF4 launch
-headshots sometimes kill with 1-2 shots sometimes they count as bodyshots
-grenades have to be unlocked with purchase, in-game currency or real money
-the last con points out the glaring issue of most F2P games out there: extremely pay to win
This list could go on and on but tl;dr: if you want a worse, free version of Counter-Strike, give this trash a try. The worse that can happen is a few minutes of your life lost downloading and realizing how bad this game is.
Any other reason to go for this game over any other shooter? Nah, I'm pretty sure I gave my PC aids while testing."
17235,f2p.. give it a try..
17236,Sometimes this game is pretty fun and sometimes id like to rather put a cat in a cementmixer then trying to start this piece of shit for the 50000000 time ^-^-
17237,"kinda bought bullets(currency)and then i carnt log back into the game
"
17238,"Got into a game, was quite fun. The game crashed for both me and my friend. Tried to restart it. One. Two. Fifteen times. Still said ""This player is already logged into the game"" AAAAAAAAAAAAAND i dont recommend this game anymore."
17239,team fortress: global offensive
17240,Good game for chilling. It just need a little bit more updates (i hope that happen in future).
17241,Body physics are the best and most funny thing in the game
17242,Good game ruined by  d o g s h i t  maps
17243,"Really shit, generic F2P FPS that you would find on the appstore. Also the controls are messed up + the game has a ton of glitches/bugs."
17244,"Geilstes FPS Spiel,
Und dann auch noch for free!
Geil spiele es so hart oft,
danke Steam 😉"
17245,"The only thing that I can think of it being an issue is that even when you shut the game down, it still thinks you are logged in and that is a pain in the butt. But other than that, I love this game. It is easy to pick up, and if you are someone that doesn't want to spend money on CSGO, this is the game for you."
17246,"I wish I could write a detailed response as to the quality of the multiplayer experience. However, I couldn't endure through the tutorial. Not because it was challenging, or difficult, but because the game felt clunky, generic, and lacked an attention to detail that I look for in my shooters.

Possibly this is due to it being a small budget game, or maybe it's due to the fact that so many people hold Free-To-Play games to a lower standard than paid games. I simply can't suggest it, but hey, the game is free, it doesn't hurt to check it out yourself."
17247,"Just another freemium FPS with stupid weapom mechanics and lot of cosmetics to buy, if you dont have the money to buy BF or COD this one will give you some fun but dont wait for something better than a Crossfire/Point Blank with better graphics : )"
17248,yes
17249,it is a very good game and free so you should download it!
17250,love the game it is like a free csgo
17251,"Utterly disgraceful, horribly designed maps, ridiculously unbalanced weapons. Don't even waste your time."
17252,"like some cheap china sh!t game, and, also, maybe I am unlucky, the first match in this game is so toxic. Not gonna play it again"
17253,controls are too garbage to be fun
17254,"I think this game is very good i like everything  about it.the only thing i dislke is the clan appliction  becuase it very difficult to enter. I personally think everyone should enter clans automaticly on till the clan is full with the maximum number of players and if the clan leader will decide to keep a player in or not.

I really really do recommend this game to everyone you will definitely have a great time play it."
17255,"The game is absolutely horrible. Character movement is clunky, shooting feels bad, weapon feedback is almost non-existent, sounds are super horrible (especially fleshy sound when you hit an enemy), locations are small and poorly designed. From the looks of it, the game tries to be CS: GO with better visuals, but fails miserably.

Overall, this is one of the worst f2p shooters on Steam."
17256,I'm having lots of fun with it. They are pretty generous with their currency. Doesn't feel pay to win. Lots of gun options. I do wish there was more customization per gun tho. Overall having a good time.
17257,"why no audio??
"
17258,"Literally just played this game, first time playing it, and already I'm finding it great! The tutorial is quite useful, the BOT TDM is great fun if you aren't used to online PVP kinda stuff and the maps are perfectly set out for different tactics, whether run and gun, sniping, or support! It's all excellent, I definitely recommend this game, you should try playing it!

Just a warning: There are aimbotters in the game, so don't expect fair fight, plus, it's not really equal anyway, starters will have a hard time getting anywhere until they have actual weapons, it can be a real pain."
17259,"I only played this game for 2.2 hours, and i already LOVE it, it doesnt have a toxic community, its easy to win and easy to lose, making it fair, the graphics are awesome for a UE3 game, gameplay is intense and awesome, every kill you get is satisfying and rewarding, and its just in early access, so 1.0 might be WAY better."
17260,It's just fun
17261,:(
17262,"is a relly nice game. Whit a good grafic for a free to play game
"
17263,"It was okay and it sure does need imporving like mpvement penlties and spray controle but other than r#that, great early access game."
17264,"It's an alright game. But it's not fair when you have: hackers, cheaters, campers. I rarely play it because it's fun the first time, but late on you forget about it and you then play it again and cheaters, camper etc.
"
17265,7/10
17266,Классная игра если чесно советую но я хочю золотой черный с точечками калаш и дигл а дигл золотой мне разработчики дай мне пожалуста я трачю на эту игру много времи
17267,"Definitely fun to play, as a total noob in past few quick matches I played I was ranked last then second to last and then third...and when you're a noob you got to take what you can as a victory I don't know what I'm doing. Aside from running decently and what not I'd say just try it since it's free it may be worth it for you."
17268,I would not recommend this game. The game is full of hackers already. Shooting through walls and 1 hit killing while tanking full mags. Also seen aimbots.
17269,"This is a good game. It is a lot of fun WHEN it works. Let's see the pros and cons:

Pros: 
A lot of fun
Servers are good
Cons: 
SO MANY DAMN HACKERS 
Some weapons are broken"
17270,Nooope. Game is shit. Full of hackers and they made it so you cant quick scope. If you move with a sniper  when aiming it fucks up ur aim a shit ton. basiically noscoping. Ha great game 0/10
17271,"This, is a great game when you can't afford CS or COD, cause it's a mix of it :)"
17272,"A decent free to play counter-strike-esque style FPS game.  The maps are a bit shabby but the gunplay feels decent enough to be enjoyable.  However, much like with many other team based FPS games my personal experience with the game was dealing with your typical cancerous tryhard teammates.  Backseat players who call you bad if you don't clutch 4 kills and a diffuse with 10 seconds left.  People who will talk trash on their team calling them all kinds of explatives even though they died first.  If you can look past the cancer that is the stereotypical ""tryhard"" FPS gamer additude being present, you'll probably enjoy this game for what it is.  A free to play CS:GO ""clone"" with a few twists.  Personally though, I cannot recommend it based on my personal experience with it."
17273,"Yea Overall a bad game Its not one of the best save your time 
Something like call of duty is better.

3/10 Good Graphics Dont Make A Good Game"
17274,"Honestly there are so many other games that have copied this format at this point that I really can't see the point in this one. There is literally nothing new or interesting about it, it's just another fps cs:go rip"
17275,Crap absolute crap this is a poorly made money grabber no thought went into it it's just a 90's version of modern C.O.D this is filth make a game properly you dick heads.
17276,Nice online FPS game
17277,"- Downloaded
- Played Tutorial
- Uninstalled.

Don't waste your time, or do.
I'm not a cop."
17278,"dont let the videos fool you. yeah its a decent f2p game but NO weapon customization? what. a game that looked so promising to me, like escape from tarkov without the hardcore crap? yeah big disappointment, more like a b rate cod with sluggish controls"
17279,Probably the most generic game I've ever played.
17280,"Has decent core mechanics when it comes to the shooting, however the map design left me bored before even the first match was over.  Might check it out later to see if the in-match gameplay flow is better later.  For now though? Not worth checking out."
17281,"Saw this in my recommended list and decided to try it. This is pretty much a clone of GitS: First Assault, and I wouldn't be surprised if it headed in the same direction (as in: devs refuse to work with community, then shut the game down citing ""lacked interest""). The graphics are fine, but the controls are a little different than normal PC FPS games. It is jumpy and I found myself rubber-banding immediately. That being said, I suffered many surprise deaths for enemies that materilised out of nowhere. At this time I wouldn't recommend this game, unless you like jumpy crackhead shooters. No tactics at all, just run and shoot everything. You are also hit with many pages of ads that puts this game straight into pay-to-win category."
17282,"Ugh such a badly executed game. Why? Because:


Extremely small maps with only 2-3 corridors
High damage weapons vs low health. 2-3 bullets your are dead. Wins who has best ping.
The sound effects are sooo bad, the SFX sound a bit better than Quake or Doom. The first ones.
Soundtrack is just noisy af.
The game UI is absolutely horrendous. Please hire a good UI/UX designer. There are so many buttons and menus and submenus and colours and graphics and ugly fonts and more menus and buttons and colour.
Time-limited weapon purchases. Uses the gun rental model from Battlefield Play4Free which I absolutely hate. You can get some guns forever though.
AOE Airstrikes in a map the size of a grocery store. What could possibly go wrong?
Sloppy squad/specialization implementation. Loadouts are nice, but there's no real Assault/Recon/Medic gameplay, just people who choose diffferent weapons.
Graphics are not that great as reviews try to convince you and definitely worse than the screenshots.Looks like Arma2 or Battlefield 3 and I played it on Ultra max settings of course.

TL;DR No idea why the hype, feels like a very bad copy of CS."
17283,"cs:go but cheaper and faster (lag wise), also supports 日本語, so ja its pretty good stuff my nibbas."
17284,I wish you could update the GOLD CRATES LIKE another crate or change it up and add sometihng else you can win i already won what i wanted from it tbh and some others.
17285,I CANT LAUNCH THE GAME
17286,"TL;DR
Pros:
* Fun CoD/CS:GO like shooter
* Free

Cons:
*Only one game mode you can use perks. That mode takes forever to get into a game.
*Map design isn't great. Typically one sided. TOO SMALL leads to spawn camping.
*Guns are either worthless or to similar. AK=GOD and nothing else. 
*To many people take advantage of their bad ping. Makes for a poor experience. 


Black Squad is the wet dream of an early 2000's male teen. It takes CS:Go and CoD shoves them together and attempts to be something slightly newer, but falls a little short. 

You will start your career in the Black Squad by going through a tutorial. Of course there are the modern tutorial cliches, ""LMB to Fire, W,A,S,D to move,"" etcetera. It isn't until later in the brief tutorial that you learn about your Perks and how to use them. That right there is the only important information found in the tutorial. It will leave you wondering why the game even needed a CoD-esque cinematic tutorial? It would have sufficed to just run you through it within a minute. 

After that you'll start playing the actual game. Like most players you'll most likely jump into TDM. At which point you'll be wondering, ""Where are the perks?"" Then after a few games you'll think to yourself, ""Well why the f*** did it tell me about this if they aren't even here?"" Well that's because they are in the Battle Match gamemode and not TDM. So they thought far enough to tell you how to use something, but neglected to tell you it is only a feature in one gamemode.

That gamemode btw, will typically take you anywhere from 30 seconds to 10 minutes to get into. Just prepare yourself now for longer wait times. Battle Match pits 16 players against another 16 in a ""Destroy the objectives"" style game. Both teams have crates with life labeled A-E on the map. It is your goal to damage and destroy the enemies while protecting yours. Only problem with this is the general map design. 

In Battle Match the maps are slightly big enough to fit all of the objectives, but not big enough that you can't run to your opponents spawn in 10 seconds. Poor Map design is a clear pattern in Black Squad. Some maps are 100% symmetrical to each other while others take liberties and attempt to make a more unique map. The maps that aren't symmetrical will almost always have a ""better side."" Explicitly VBSS, Dock Night, and Revenge all have an advantageous side to their respective map. 

Weapons also feel lacking. I've yet to find an exact reason on why I shouldn't use the starter weapons, as every other weapon I've used seems to be outclassed by them, other than maybe the AK (we'll get to it in a bit,) and snipers. Any rifle other than the TAR seem vastly the same, or slightly less than. Both shotguns, the KSG and M1014 are 100% worthless, lack the ability to do bonus headshot damage like every other weapon, and take longer to kill than your basic pistol. Many rifles in the game feel the same recoil wise and their stats are not noticeably different. Marksman Rifles (DMRs) are worthless as well. They have two different sights, but lack the ability to change from single fire to burst or FA. Hell sights don't matter because hipfire has the same accuracy. LMGs are just rifles with bad accuracy and recoil, but hey at least you dont have to reload. 

Then theres the AK. IT IS GOD. Its bullet spread has killed my friend and I in a OSK more times than I can count. If someone has an AK on the other team, you're helmet has a magnet on it. Be prepared to hate this weapon with all of your might. 

That AK is going to kill you while you're behind a wall, a box, in spawn doesnt matter. Why? Becuase you will find yourself up against players with 150 ms, 200ms, heck I played against someone with 800+ms ping the other day. You will see a lot of players with high pings, which only makes your experience worse. Especially when its a headshot behind that wall. BS really needs to setup ping limits if it wants to be taken serious.

Other than the crappy map design, bad netcode and the true lack of defining gun characteristics the game isn't bad for a F2P. I find it fun and challenging, but it could be better. I really wish there was a mixed option for reccomending because that is how I feel. You'll either love it or go buy CS:Go."
17287,Really fun game. Super addicting!
17288,top
17289,"I only rated this down because there are some issues. This is a very fun game and I'm glad it's getting exposure. I will give it a pass for being in early access but there are a few things that need to be ironed out. 1. Matchmaking needs to be better. Some people are tired of solo queueing and getting paired up with full clans in comms. 2. There is a lot of hacking in this game and even a number of streamers have noticed it. If you google black squad the second thing that pops up is ""blacksquad hacks"" and basically it disconnects them from the game if you type their name in. Anyway, it's a brilliant game but needs ironed out."
17290,great game !!!
17291,Cool
17292,sorry but i cant recommend this game the ping makes it unplayable and no report system so all the hackers can run free and ruin the game dont get me wrong i liked the game for the 10 hours i played but i cant anymore ill maybe come back when they add a report system and fix the ping/region lock last time i played i got a 11k ping sooo not touching the game till the main things get fixed ill keep the game on my libary for the time being
17293,about an hour of gameplay and absolutely loving this
17294,So bad. Go play CSGO lol
17295,"just another free cod rip
but its kinda good"
17296,very good game :) i like it
17297,"terrible map design !
sniper is too op !
still have cheater !
"
17298,"What a great game and its free too, so dont complain about something thats free!"
17299,It's a fairly addicting game to be honest with you. I've already thrown 43 hours of my life away for this noble cause.
17300,"I recently picked this back up after originally playing the beta. I love this game, I love the fact there's so many weapon options and it's not pay to win. Hands down best F2P FPS out there."
17301,"Heres the run down before the short and sweet of it.
its a clean game, runs smooth, nice visuals but has some problems. not game breaking but problems for sure.
For one i get over 100 ping because they only have 1 server somewhere in north america, which is freaken nutty for a game that wants to be international and competitive. this causes you get run out and get shot or hear your gun go off but you somehow got shot first. really sucks. guns are pretty balanced and there is enough difference to fit your play style between them all. So far from what ive seen you can get all guns from in game currency without paying a cent. but heres the problem... they have 4 differnt god damn currencys. standard gold you get from missions, medals which you get from (events) and logining in every day. BS coin (which is BS to get) and Bullets, which you have to buy. oh and btw to get BS coins you have you purchase bullets and spend them on the random boxes. its pretty damn obnoxious but its the only way to get gun skins and its seems to keep the P2W at bay. but i can see that changing easily down the line. level designs are always being reworked but the game modes are super limited. they have 1 mode where you can select 1 of 4 classes that have skills you can use from points you earn by killing and doing damage. the tuturial of the game makes a big show of them. HOWEVER there is only 1 game mode where you can use them. kinda shit.
but it is still in alpha so im hoping they will step up their game over time.

Recommended with resevations.
Pros:
fast paced game play
clean development
active anticheat system(mostly works)
nice graphics
Not pay to win(yet)

Cons:
limited play style
limited match type
Lag issues
4 kinds of currency (YES FOUR!)"
17302,"Thought it was ok. Some of the maps were too meshed up, run straight at each other and just shoot, in my opinion and could have benefited from a more city-scape or farm-scape, urban terrain type of layout requiring more strategy from teams. I ended up dropping it because of a lack of xbox-controller support. I can't recommend it without controller-support because it's such an important feature for some of us; and YES, some of us do prefer to use a controller even in games without aim-assist. That's the dream actually, a game without aim-assist, and solid controller mapping."
17303,"well ive played 2 matches, and honestly... its pretty entertaining game, i find it very relaxinf (coming from Pubg).. 

this is a very fast paced CQB game, with a call of dooty playstyle... i mean as far as a FREE game goes, its WAYY better than fortnite"
17304,shit
17305,"waste of time and space, but what do i expect from a game with a name like this"
17306,"Very nice, good graphics, even in low end pc. 
Inmersive and actually fun. 
"
17307,The game is nice but has soome problems it kicks me out of the game completely and most of the time i need to restrat my pc to play again but  after all its good
17308,Highly unfun. Its like CSGO R6S and COD had a degenerate child
17309,"thx
"
17310,goooood
17311,"Its a good ame but need a littlr to be better 
1) make the player have auto revive (at lest in *TDM/Capture/Destruction*)
2) add some daily challange for nice rewards like BS coins and meadals 
     chalanges like killing in a specific weapos or in specific way
3) add events
.
thanks for give us a interesting game 
^_^"
17312,how to fix missing executable??
17313,It has good gameplay but this game has the most horrible map design in any game ever.
17314,really fun
17315,Best
17316,.
17317,"i mean the game is decent you know but then you start sniping...that is where everything goest to fucking shite m'kay you see i do snipe and i do it alot and im pretty good at it ppl call me a smurf, hacker etc. and i always notice how like 1/4 of my shots fail to register on a guy and sometimes the bullets just fly off to the side and my sniper rifle (wich is the one that deals second most damage in the game) does the most hitmarkers and no kills for where other snipers that deal significintly less damage most of the time kill me with 1 shot. so my conclusion is yes the game is decent... much better than CSGO and its free so just stay away from something complex as snipers and stick with assult beacuse this game is terrible at sniper gameplay"
17318,nice
17319,"Basically Counter-Strike updated with a few new gimmicks, but it avoids becomming as crazy as CoD and the like while retaining the gameplay style of CS."
17320,Tac. Reload.
17321,A Better Game then other games. i frequently Loved this Game. its good and too awesome even i get some low fps then also a better game and even it would be and now the new update is pretty Awesome..
17322,"This is an amazing game. Good gameplay and graphics, it's practically a CS:GO and Rainbow Six Siege mashup."
17323,"Has potential.

would i reccomend for Australians? No, 100+ ping to every server.

anywhere else then yes i would reccomend it. will change to thumbs up once there is Australian servers."
17324,very nice game and its free!
17325,Very fun small maps but other than that I like it
17326,"** THE SERVERS ARE EXTREMELY BAD!! ~ hence my small playtime with this game. I played 1 match and the server kicked towards the end as well as people lagging. **

I heard this was liek CSGO, it's not. It has wallbangs and you can die pretty quickly and I do love the pace at times. But it is not strategic! CSGO is slower paced than this game because CSGO focus's on teamwork and thinking through the problem ~ YOU NEED BRAINS. This game is so quick that you don't ever feel like you are the character you are playing. I wold recommend you fork out the cash to paly Counter Strike : Global Offensive over this game ANYDAY!"
17327,Ass ana pussy
17328,pretty good just need new maps
17329,"dis game funny
"
17330,"Peoples: Bryan!
Bryan: What?
Peoples: Money, money, money, we need to add more skins, dlc and temporary weapons!
Bryan: Yeah! New Lamborghini!"
17331,"quick gameplay, easy to pick up. Needs more weapons"
17332,"Black Squad is something that pops up when you crossbreed Counter-Strike and Call of Duty. From Counter-Strike, it takes the inability to sprint and the crouch-only limitation for soldier firing positions, as well as the ability to install silencers on-the-go (woo! I guess). From Call of Duty, it takes the overly massive reliance on high rate of fire and high damage per shot weapons to a whole new extreme. It is a twitch reflex based first person shooter that punishes the slightest mistake, thusly resulting in your death. Over and over. Many times.

Now, bear in mind, for a casual game it is pretty fun, but try not to play it too much. Otherwise you will get overly competitive and that's where the game's enjoyment factor just plummets. I have played quite a bit of Counter-Strike and a lot of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare back in the day, so I know what it takes to be good in a twitch-based shooter, but this game managed to frustrate me quite a bit once I got competitive.

Take into account that camping can be done very simply in this game, but counter-camping is also a thing. It's a point in favor of the game in my opinion as it stimulates people to move more as opposed to sitting in corners. Aside from that, it has a rather decent internal economy model (by which I mean the way you acquire guns). It's certainly better than most other shooters of this design (I'm looking at you, Combat Arms) and it trumps over them in many ways, but, as I mentioned before, one of its downsides is that it is extremely fast paced and it leaves no room for tactical thinking. Just randomly select one route to go down to (out of three; that's original...) and just blast someone until they blast you.

The game is not shy in its automatic weapon department. It has a lot of shiny and cool-looking assault rifles, but that seems to be about it. There is no way to switch your firing mode from full auto to burst or semi-automatic, there aren't a lot of semi-automatic rifles (I really wanted a QBU-88 or a DMR version of the HK 417). It is a game dominated by automatics, so don't be surprised to see everyone running and gunning you down with their fancy full auto rifle. It also has a few sniper rifles, but the biggest issue with these is that, no matter the caliber of the bullet, they're pretty much instant death weapons and it does not even matter where you get shot.

Overall, I'd give this game a six out of ten just because it's a good ""stop-gap solution"" on your way to finding better, more enjoyable games."
17333,Veri veri good game
17334,sda
17335,"Very good game in my opinion, please add controller support :)"
17336,It's Nice FPS and multiplayer game for free.

17338,"Really great game, fast paced shooter with elements of tatical teamplay, they've copied elements of other successful shooters and blended them into this.
There's a 8v8/5v5 demo mode like csgo, there's the standard tdm, and also a great battle mode 16v16 where the object is to attack enemy points or defend your own, which is great fun."
17339,Cool Sounds/Gameplay
17340,good game
17341,"ITS THE FREE TO PLAY CS-GO
but
smaller maps
less guns
less skins
less knifes
less gloves
less loot
less fun
less maps
less gamemodes
and..... less players
but for a free to play cs-go its worth a try it might strike you as better

17350,"It's a really nice FPS game, it's free and it's kinda reminding me of Crossfire without the annoying Pay2Win added weapons."
17351,"this game has more playerbase then Blacklight: Retribution and Planetside 2
that meant something :<>"
17352,"pls u can add target practice means randomly target will arrive at any time and u have to shoot it 
the players reflex time practice and aim accuracy and fast dissession making skills can develop faster
but the game is awsome no one can describe in words and it just in 5 gb thats the really shoking thing
thanks for this really cool game....... ^_^
"
17353,"I must admit that I was suspicious, but this game is actually enjoyable, fair on the reward side and balanced on the weapon side, fun game, it has very few cons ( being a ""casual"" game of course) and many pros, definitely raccomended.
"
17354,awesome game
17355,"This game is alot of fun the gun play reminds me of CS 1.6 and the load outs like CoD. The down fall with this game is the match making. It is trash, ive been playing this game for a few days and every other game your facing a Premade game on the other team. They need to fix this and add some kind of voice chat."
17356,Nice one.... For free to play it's awesome..
17357,nice game quality
17358,"Good for a f2p but annoying and P2W aswell...
If you dont have money for CS sure get this or another like this...
but if u can spend the money just get CS or get annoyed of how people dont die at this game... even with full clips... not gonna talk about the hacking in this game cause welll its a f2p... i dont recommend.

https://i.imgur.com/GwAF6a1.jpg

I shot with a bolt action sniper rifle, kills  both the 2 first guys you see from the where the crosshair is placed. Hitboxes need looking into. If  you are not so good with aim though this game is good for you."
17361,"Amzing combat/speed/animations! Fast and good responding / accuracy. Also the ranking and friend and chatting features etc.. good working and great to have!
Shop is a bit less but its still a free playing game so I find it accaptable for what they give us in return!

Worth to try? Everyone their own taste and if its Free to Play well.. why not?

8/10"
17362,"Pros:
Good concept
Not too much pay to win features, except grenades
Many gamemodes
Not bad graphics
Fast match finding
Runs on low end pc

Cons:
2009 UI from Chinese games
Too muchh unnecesarry skins and crates to squieeze out money
Too much guns, but they do not make a big difference, not unique guns at all
Inbox method for rewards is confusing, when opening crates you get the loot in your inbox and have to claim
Map design is just horrible, you can never feel freedom, low amount of free space
Map graphics is not the best, I mean textures not resolution and effects, boring and gray.
Too confusing GUI
Crates are bad, and contain bad loot

I'd rate it a solid 6/10, good concept, bad implementation. If you got nothing else to play, give it a try, but don't expect too much of it."
17363,how can i use skins it doesnt apear ????
17364,low quality product
17365,"If you like fast paced shooter's, but don't have money this is the game for you.

*Regarding the rumors that it's pay to win, they're not true. After completing the tutorial you are given more then enough money(gold) to purchase almost any weapon you want and you get to keep it forever. 
*There is only a couple of weapon's which you have to buy via medal's, the games second currency which you also get just by playing and ranking up. 
*All weapons in the game have some sort of attachement(s) like the laser sight, suppressor and a grenade launcher all of which are usable and can be used mid game.


*There is somewhat a messy lag compensation system where even if the enemy has only 30-40 more ping then you, they usually end up wining gun fight's(either that or i just suck at aiming).
*Also not a whole lot of weapons, i kinda expected waaaay more variety in that regard but hopefully more of them will get added as time goes on.
*The map design is somewhat terrible frankly, the dev's should get onto that.
*The fact that recoil appears to be random and that you can run around and shoot without any accuracy loss may be very....unattractive for some people, make no mistake though there is ample ammount's of recoil in the game.

And yea apart from that there isn't anything wrong with the game really, it's just not for everyone
Guess i prefer to sit in a bush all day and snipe people from 10 kilometers away."

17372,"What is this shit. Its free, but is terrible."
17373,Yeah that's gonna be a no for me dog.
17374,"After playing this game for a while, I've decided to scrap my initial positive review. The game unfortunately has an extremely unbalanced matchmaking system and is riddled with private hacks that the developers refuse to do anything about. The only system for getting rid of these people is a reporting link (that you have to dig for) rather than an in game tracking system. On top of this, after trying to leave a match with the hacking clan ""Gaben"", I kept getting put back into the same match by the matchmaking system, being forced to play against a bunch of hackers. 

The gameplay itself isn't bad, but some of the maps are very bad - in fact most of them have easy spawn traps that the devs have only tried to remedy by adding a brief spawn protection... probably one of the laziest ways to deal with such an issue."
17375,"Not a huge fan of FPS games and certainly not an expert in this genre, but I think this is the best free pick-up-n-play FPS on the market.  Updates consistant, great community and quite a bit of variation of matches available.

Game is free, but I have invested rougly $6 in support and have pretty much gotten everything I want in the Premium Store.  Well balanced and well worth the price!"
17376,"its free and free to play, what more do you need?"
17377,Really good FPS. Aimpunch needs fixing and players should spawn in with full clips as well as when auto-reloading.
17378,"[b]This game is basically: What if Counter Strike was more like Call Of Duty?[/b]

Its got Great gun porn, but no customization. Plays like counter strike (you dont need to ads), but feel like CoD.

Not my cup of team, doesnt feel as good as counter strike, and I've had enough call of duty in my life.

[spoiler]Go play Warface.[/spoiler]

Oh and you can pay to be an asian girl, so depending on how you identify, good."
17379,Its a watered down verson of a love child between CoD and CSGO. It does very well for being a free to play game and it doesnt force u to buy shit to get a serious advantage. It could use some improvements here and there like the fact u cant customize your gun. It comes all preset. There is a decent aray of maps and game modes but some of them like demolition take forever cuz its a first to 8 rounds win (should give more exp and make it best outa 3 or 5) The guns are decently balanced surprisingly. They all have their strengths and weaknesses. Ive actually been having fun with this game from time to time with my friends. Def should check it out. It is free after all XD
17380,"lots of perminent guns and game is quite liberal with giving in game funds

only problem i seem to have is it wont launch the game launcher a lot

would love to have lean other then that its great so far 9/10 would recomend"
17381,"Overall a good game: Runs well and smooth. Good looking maps and weapons. Strafing feels good and responsive.

A lot of grenade launchers - too many. Remove the grenade launchers, and keep the normal grenades.
Throwing grenades feels off - they dont go that far, feels like you're throwing a bowling ball.
Jumping feels wierd, both mid jump and after landing.
Too small maps IMO.

I feel like its missing an identity somehow."

-But everything else from next gen gaming mechanics
 -High detailed maps and enviorments that make u feel like u are experiencing 1943 all over again. 
-The story in this game takes place in a cyberpunk world of Stalingrad 2099 where  there are 2 factions the evil group known as the White Squad who want to take over the world. You the new cyber-Black Squad are the ones who fight back and are the last front lines. So deep it gave my 90 year old world war 2 war veteran grandpa PTSD cardiac arrest.

17391,"Pros:  Graphics look great, weapons act and sound great, it's free!!

Cons:  Maps could be a bit bigger, offline with bots is hilarious (the bots don't move, and you can just add them only to stand around fpr taerget practice), not enough players so matches take longer to find, spawn camping is ridiculous.

Honestly the reason I got rid of the game is the inability to have an offline game with bots that actually move and fire back.  (the tutorial is the closest thing to offline, but that get's boring and repetitive).  How is someone supposed to get good at the game dynamics if you can't practice offline?  Matches sometimes take too long to find, and would be easier to just play offline during those times."
17392,"people complain about the little problems in this game but forget that it's FREE. If you want a game to pass a few hours then i recommend you give it a try. Yes it's not the best, but it's fast paced and is a lot of fun for a free game"

As an FPS:

Spawn points are very close which, especially on small maps, reminds me of Arena Shooters like Quake- the fast-paced action adds to the fun factor even more however the mechanic that prevents me from shooting freshly spawned players has no place in TDM. Few people can survive the everlasting onslaught of frequent spawning and as such I'd prefer  to not be put at a disadvantage for dominating. In this regard it is especially painful to engage in a firefight and have a blue player act as a meatshield for your enemy who wouldn't be able to sustain one more bullet.

By default sprinting is put on Mwheelclick for some reason I do not yet understand. It is easy to go to the controls and change it but the majority of players across many different games generally use the Shift-button.

Features I would like to see explained in the Tutorial but I also have to say with 10 hours in I had that down:

- How to use Melee Weapons
- How to use Grenades via Quickthrow
- Lasersight and what it is actually for except for giving away your location (Newbie trap or Bait?)

I installed the game, had an initial 200.000 gold and decided to buy a few boxes in order to open them, can't hurt to try. The boxes only contained grenades and I did actually expect at least a single weapon. Now this isn't about drop rates because they are as bad as you would expect from any f2p title except that the payments go towards skins and cosmetics and have absolutely zero impact on the game except for making a lot more 'fluffy'. As for weapons there is several Free DLCs to unlock Starter Packs. After having spent some time in the game I can say I have unlocked every useful type of weapon I will ever need but overall I own about 90 % of everything except the skins which are around 100 bucks each (No way in hell I would ever go for that ;)

This also brings me to another point, there is three different currencies in the game, the Shop and Medal Shop require some work as they are immensely complicated to navigate through as a first-timer and were rather discouraging initially.
The only reward box which is obtainable for 30.000 gold contains grenades. Stay away from that.

There is weekly quests for players who play consistently with lots of drops and rewards but I find how this system is setup a little bit too much of an incentive to logon to get said rewards. It could be more subtle rather than “Play 6 hours a day to get X” how about ""Kill 20 players with Grenade""?

Other than that great game for the reasons outlined above, Newbie FPS players will have some fun while skilled and experienced users will rape public Matchmaking. I drop 30+ kills on a regular basis and I'm just an average player. Naturally I get stomped quite often too. Considering this game is only a few gigabytes it's great to play on the side and not take too seriously. If you have some mates Clan Matches are there too and even if players are missing on your side you can just get a ringer by creating a lobby, inspecting people and then play with them or kick them out.

5/5 will and have recommended"
17396,best rip off first person shooter ever
17397,Very nice f2p shooter game!!!!!!! Copy of cod and csgo put into onE! but shit maps LOLO
17398,Pretty nice game i recommended u can play it on ultra settings even if u have dual core.Amazing game but hard to get medals!
17399,Oyun kesinlikle efsane ve cidden denildiği gibi P2W değil. F2P oyun ariyorsanız tf2'den sonra bu tam size göre.
17400,Nice gameplay
17401,Mostly positive but would be cool to trade/sell weapons and items
17402,"Pretty good actually. I HAVEN'T seen any pay to win elemets, which is great! 

 If you're looking for something in the vein of combat arms then this game should scratch that itch."
17403,Literally the biggest money grab i have ever seen. The game has ads in it that look like they are from the age of dial up
17404,An awesome game recommended to all true FPS players. Feels like CS:GO but free. Most Addictive
17405,best game of all of the time
17406,Suprisingly good for a f2p game.
17407,nace
17408,Worst game
17409,It's like cs:go but with actual gameplay instead of skins
17410,"Decent graphics but everything else is crap.No sway ppl run with snipers & get a perfect headshot,campfest(maps are like a 5 year old made it 2 stairways,3 hallways ,6 room & big open area in middle)need 3 shots with handgun to kill some1(& thats 3 headshots LOL wtf) & so on & on....It only took 5 min to see its pure garbage or other words PURE CRAP.
Wouldnt recommended it to a 5 year old.Avoid it like a plague.

17415,"The maps are terribly cramped, the design is bland, and gameplay rewards spawn camping."
17416,"A COD clone where there is no penalty for jumping or not aiming.

17417,This game is a gem in a pig trough. Seriously. Its that awesome. Almost as good as COD.
17418,GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
17419,"shroud plays it so,,"
17420,"Played it for a while, but I noticed the balacing between the weapons is way off. Example: I have an assault gun and I need to shoot a whole magazine in an enemy. The enemy has a pistol and just needs on bullet (not even a headshot).


Bullets go straight through a wall (stone/metal, carboard I understand). People are just behind you, out of the blue. As soon as you say something bad you get a report (how the h*ll do you report someone) and get 3 warnings and someone unknown telling you he/she (?) hopes you learned your lesson. I asked who he/she was, but no reply.
I see messages of people getting kicked because of anit-cheat. But I still see a lot of people with aimbots and stuff. I got recordings. 

At first it looked good, but I'm off to try a new game and remove this one. Too bad,"
17421,"I played this game 1 match and its does not deserves positive reviews it gets :/ game feels very cheap like superman action figure you get on christmas which breaks in 2 minutes .
GRAPHICS - 0
GAMEPLAY - 0

Nothing good and inovative , if you are going to download this just dont... go search dirty bomb at least you can have fun there ."
17422,controls are not the best. game does not feel fluid

17425,Great game <3
17426,👺👺
17427," What a great game and its free too, so dont complain about something thats free! The graphics are much better than i expected and game play while small, is intense and reasonably fun. 

But that net code...Ohhh my god, even playing way out of region due to there being no oceania servers (developers need to  add one) the game netcode was AWESOME!!! if only larger franchise like EA and UBISOFT could learn how to pay proper attention to this. While it is still in early development i can see this being a long lasting game as long as they keep player numbers per match small ."
17428,cool
17429,i buy this gam for onli 0 doler and i getting vairus
17430,"dis game is schit, you only downlaod this schit gejm if you don't have any monii to buyy conter striiik,cod or battlefield."
17431,Fuck this gamr i cant start it i get the launcer on my screen and press play and then the game shuts itself down
17432,It's a crappy CS
17433,bardzo fajne
17434,Games are quick and fun.
17435,Overall preety ballanced very fun fast paced fps!
17436,10/10 for satisfying headshots
17437,Pretty fun with friends
17438,A game with alot of potential. Has both positives and negatives. Can improve in the future.
17439,"This game reminds me of blackshot, csgo, battlefield and cod series all in one. Best part is, its free and not pay to win!"
17440,"Not much content here, maps are so small you often run into the other team's spawn (mostly a tdm issue), guns don't behave like you would expect them to and there is a weird round in the chamber indicator separate from the ammo in the mag. Horizontal recoil is random so after a couple of shots most guns start jerking violently left to right, customization options (not skins, mind you) are very limited so fans of military barbie can go f... find something else. Since the playerbase is fairly small, ranked is anything but balanced (teams vs solo randoms, skill gap and so on). All in all it's not a very good game but it's far from the worst. I recommend it because it's one of the better generic asian free to play shooters atm and I keep wasting time playing it for some reason so I guess it does something right. At least it doesn't make you pay for using guns you already own like some -_-."
17441,"I still cannot believe this game exists, it is too good to be true. It is fun, immersive, addictive, satisfying and FREE.
I love it for the following:
1- Swift matchmaking, minor waiting.
2- Focused and simple gameplay, easy to learn hard to master.
3- Very rewarding, skill wise and tactical wise.
4- Runs onnormal PCs fast and stable with good FPS.
5- Very low latency on servers.
6- Small patches and good maintenance, minor glitches.
7- Lovely graphics, catchy and smooth.
8- Game mechanics are superb, no need for realism it is enjoyable as is.
9- The man makes the weapon, every gun has his fans and can make difference.
10- Everyone in my family found it catchy and wanted to try it... Now all play it.
11- No pay to win at all, it is worth every penny though.
12-Nice music, sound effects and quotes and nice artwork allover.

This game is formidable for an FPS fan, do not overlook it! All it needs is to evolve graphically with unreal engine. The most polished free to play game ever tried after the notorious mobas... Play it!"
17442,ma nem eh jef
17443,"This game is not P2W at all. the starting ammount of money you get is enough to buy the best guns in the game. the only pay part of this game is if you want the fancy skins.

The game has it's flaws yes. One most notably Ive ran into is the North American Server's ping. it somehow ranges from a normal 50-85 ping, all the way to 2056 ping. 

Other than the ping problems for the NA servers, the game is great and fun. For myself it's a great stress reliver for when im getting frustrated at more competitive games.

The game is free, check it out!"
17444,"Very good F2P FPS, I played Combat Arms for a very very long time and got sick of the changes they made. This is very similar and a ton of fun to play with good friends. There are issues of course; sniper sway, shooting while moving/jumping and crouch glitching are both major game breakers, but aside from that the game is impressively balanced and well built. Map design is very obviously still early in development, but like any FPS once you learn the ins and outs its really not all that bad. A+ from me. Bravo guys!"
17445,"The DLCs are really not worth it, maybe you should lower the price for them. but overall the game is pretty fun and i've gotten quite lucky for my starting cases."
17446,meme of the game awards
17447,"9/10 Good stuff
One of the best fps games I've ever played.
Game mechanics are so good.
Characters and graphics quality is awesome.
One comment- Servers,, Servers are kinda bad in europe. I did test it more than one time and wasn't only me who faced this lag/ping problem. also I get several dcs/connection time outs with no idea why despite having a good internet connection in other games.
except for servers this game is worth playing."

17450,Mostly positive some players in game are a bit harsh to new players but it also depends on who you involve your self around. Like any other fps there will be plenty of hot shots and A** holes but what game doesn't have that. I recommend this game for people who like fast paced shooters. btw this game isn't and wasn't released a few months ago the real version was released in asia before it was refurbished into an american language/ game for more details go to youtube and ask the question.. EDIT:2022 So ive been around since launch this game is no longer fun in my opinion. the new UI and match making system is terrible. At one point in time this game rocked but over the years it has gone down hill.
17451,I like this game it is cool and awesome i recommend to play with your friends! :D
17452,legitness
17453,süper oyun ya f2p ama p2w değil harika bir oyun para yatırınca pek birşey değişmiyor para yatıranla yatırmayan aynı seviyede harika bi fps oyunu çok hoşuma gitti.
17454,Still want my money back
17455,"If you are looking for a shooter that plays smooth and is cassual, but you don't want to waste any money on a game like call of duty then this is a game for you."
17456,Fun fast paced casual shooter. Recommend!
17457,"this game is definitly not for anyone over 14, a very childish game with terrible ideas and overall very lame and anime like with its characters, the whole them doesn't suit anything with this game style they shouldve aimed for insugency type gameplay as the weapons wouldve suited it more, it is like cs:go dumbed down for kids, playing heavy metal music for the main menu just ruins the whole game, having slutty player models is just soooo shit and having overly dressed male chararcters looks shit, im sorry but i thoutht this game would be fun but it is soooo childish, unistalling!, you have potential to make a really nice game but unfortunatly i dont know who your target audience is, there is like barely any weapon choices at all and each team can only choose those weapons destroying player uniqueness and making the game super super gay."
17458,The only problem of this game is that its name is not Counter Strike!
17459,"Game was better before,now It isnt

Playerbase has decreased (from 5k players on average to 1k players on average) and well the anticheat isnt that good ,vac is better (for those Who say vac is bad,you are wrong), fortunately i didnt find so many cheaters,but lot of Friends of mine found lot of cheaters and same ppl say on forums

And well some ridiculous microtransactions are still there 

Idk if consider the fact that you can get profit from skins on Steam market good but prices are too expensive (for some skins) for a Game that only has 1k ppl on average

Idk if devs dont notice that something is going wrong...

Now csgo is free,just go there

"
17460,"Pretty high CPU usage, virtually no GPU usage and even at lowest settings the stutters were unbearable. Map design is uninspired and poor. While the weapons feel good to use, the default sniper is clearly OP."

17462,Xernya blet
17463,"here what i honesty think about this game::

this game is heck alot better then combat arms :: the shooting and killing is so amazing:: the sound effects to this game is like wow : i so love this game and so close to gold bar allready :: this game is super amazing thank u so much for creating this game :)"
17464,Lags and constanly crashes - also no one lobby isnt full of snipers and shotguns
17465,The best free game ever! i have csgo but i played it just 10 hours then i downloaded this game and i forgot csgo! it is an awesome game!
17466,"This game has potential but I'll personally wait for a while to see if that potential actually turns into something. I'm going to just list my issues here as I find that most other aspects are quite good.

-Map design
It's horrible. Pretty much the main reason to why I don't really like the game at the moment. There are maybe like 2-3 good, enjoyable 5v5 maps and no good TDM maps.
-Currency
The game is F2P and not really pay to win, but there are several currencies (for no real reason imo) and you need to buy grenades such as smokes and he grenades, both of which are important to have in order to play the game properly. 
-Weapons
Some are good, some aren't, but what they all have in common is that the spread is wonky, they feel quite underwhelming in general (largely due to sound design) and there are so many that have almost the exact same stats that it's kinda silly.

Still, Black Squad is a decent game with potential to be great and, by the looks of it, it might actually one day get there.

17470,"EDIT: this game is currently dead. You can not find a lobby pretty much at all. In hindsight, I really like the mechanics and maps, but it just could not survive in the current FPS market without much more marketing and a more robust ranked queue. Really, really unfortunate as I think this game's shooting mechanics are close to on-par or better than CoD or R6:S

My review was originally a recommend, but after playing more, I've changed my mind. The decisions by the developers to ignore community input and rather focus on skins completely ruins this game's chance at success long-term. The core gameplay is great, but the lack of extremely basic quality of life features preasent in every modern competitive shooter make this game frustration for noobs and boring for experts.
There is no skill-based matchmaking. 
There is no voice chat. 
The UI is just terrible and confusing
Cheating is extremely common, but rarely punished
All of these together really just make me want to go play CS:GO any time I play this game. This game has been in development in one form or another for well over three years, but ultimately the result is a decent Early Access game and will absolutely never be a competitor to CS in its current form.

This feels like a good blend of the fast-paced run and gun parts of CoD and some of the tactically gamesense pieces of CS:GO. 
I've played about 1500 hours of cs:go between two accounts and achieved SMFC before losing interest. This game feels really snappy and skill-based like cs:go. There are some major differences in gameplay like pacing and the addition of grenade launchers on nearly every rifle, but I really enjoy it.

However, this game desperately needs some form of skill-based match-making. As far as I can tell, there is none. IF there is any skill-based matchmaking that is beyond just ping-based, it's completely unnoticeable. Half the time my entire team is full of superhumans who have literally not stopped playing this game since release and the other half of the time my team is full of complete idiots. There's rarely a game with a competitive score and the only reason that ever happens is because I have to carry the shit out of my team. A K/D of 2-4 shouldn't be possible in a balanced shooter, but plenty of people have that just because the balance is so terrible. There are a lot of inconsistencies with bullet penetration as well, but that's an entirely different story."
17471,I very fun game I hope that the next update have more new gun or maps
17472,This game represents a good way to relax yourself.
17473,"Very good game, does a great job competing witg CS:GO though some things could be tweaked. Definetly reccomend, it even ran on my old tower, which was an AMD E2 APU @1.70GHz and 4GB ram with a GT 710 WITH a decent frame rate. Get it, it's a good game"
17474,A good game
17475,good game like it
17476,"i like nice game but we need

0.1x timescale
Low Camera Movement Speed
Campaths
Add Depth Map
Internal Render
Remove Crosshair
Access to other players demos

Add this on the Replay and have all the respect from the editing community."
17477,"Best Free FPS Game Ever !
-Great Gameplay
-Amazing Graphics For Free FPS
-No Cheat
-Not Pay To Win
10/10"
17478,It's fun but snipers are overpowered.
17479,"While this game has a promising core, the devs are not making use of the potential it has.

Let's get some pros out of the way:
-Rewards are generous and get you set up quickly.
-Game looks and runs well.
-Pretty good visual/audio feedback on kills.
-Huge arsenal of weapons.
-The shop is free of pay2win gear, everything premium is cosmetic.
-The core gameplay is solid and fast to pick up.

Now for the cons:
-Map design is horrible, Demolition is the only gamemode with servicable maps and I'm being generous here.
-Weapon balance is bad, 3-4 assault rifles dominate the game with snipers following in their footsteps because of how easy they are to use. The rest are just awkward gimmicky weapons to use if you really don't care.
-It has a CSGO-style crate system that is somehow worse. You need to open random boxes to get another box that you can then open with a paid key and get a random item.
-Gamemodes, except for TDM and Demolition, are bland and rely on low effort gimmicks to make them unique. They're dead for a reason. TDM is a spawnkilling simulator.
-Anti-cheat is a little lacking, Battleye doesn't do much on it's own.
-There are absolute zero ways to communicate with your team because of no built-in VOIP and the dead cannot communicate with the alive players. Radio commands are extremely limited and often misleading, they don't mark anything either so ""Enemy Spotted"" is useless.

The final nail in the coffin for me personally has to be that the devs show zero intentions to accept community feedback which means the game won't really have a chance to grow. There are a lot of issues I've mentioned that just require some updates and it'll be perfectly fine but they don't seem to be interested in this approach at all. That's Neowiz for you.

The game is still playable, but I wouldn't recommend it because of this problem alone."
17480,"Just buy CS:GO , trust me"
17481,"Amazing game. I'll leave the gameplay and mechanics to the other reviews, but I felt that there is one thing no one has spoken about so far. And that is: the grammar and spelling. It is so horrible that I actually cringe when reading some of the text the game has to offer. Now, I'm no grammar nazi, but this issue really pisses me off. I love the game so much, I just want this one issue to be fixed. Otherwise amazing game, if you have any spare time or you are just simply bored and want a good game to play around with, try this one out. It's real good."
17482,well this game is like cs without the deep gun play      its like cod but you cant sprint.     it doesnt have the feel of online fps like AVA where the pace of the game fits the gunplay.  guns in bs takes no skill to use making it a very casual game. the map design is some of the worst ive ever seen in a fps multiplayer game.  the graphics are acceptable and better than most online fps out there but graphic doesnt equal to good game. i suggest try oujt for yourself first and see if you like it. its not for me where i appreciate a deep learning curve in video games.   i will wait for some other upcoming korean fps seems more legit...
17483,"If u really want to waste your time, start the tutorial and realise how bad this game is when firing the first shots, than uninstall.

17487,dat game <3 <3
17488,"Easy to pick up and play and starter guns compete fairly well against higher level players.Bot matches that reward a bit of xp for the starting players.Gun play feels smooth and the game moves at a great pace. 

Running it atm on my back up HD4000 on my i7 3770 and low 1024x768 and its holding a constant 60+ fps . Yeah its Unreal 3 so its really forgiving on hardware requirements and i think that is good given this is a free to play and most of those games can be pretty horrible in the optimization department.

Pretty fun game to play, given i play BF4 when my 1050 ti is in my system i prefer this for game modes not involving vehicle spawn spam lol."
17489,litteral garbage. everything about this game is poorly made
17490,"as a free game its good but if its possible to add in game voice it will be best. Also we need a way to purchase BS coin with real currency or something like that. others stuff like gfx,gameplay,physics all r much better than many others paid game <3"

On a serious note, this game doesn't work if you have a proper firewall, even if you let the game's .exe and its launcher through. This is a serious design (and security) flaw, and until that is fixed, I cannot recommend this game, on principle."

Even do its free, it's not fun considering the huge amount of cheaters that play. Most of the time you will be scrathing your head wondering: How did I die?!? You'll have a small amount of decent fun the rest is just you particapeting being someones moving target and wondering why are you playing with PRO's of somekind. Graphics pretty nice. Autobalance complety broken. Maps made for campers. Weapons nonconsistent. Happpy I am done with it. Never again

17514,"Shooting a gun in this game feels amazing, and you have clear indicaton wether or not you hit an enemy. The fairest free to play shooter that I ever seen when it comes to business model. The only thing that the game would need more of is interesting game modes. 

So I safe to say that I'm recommending the game, it's free you won't lose anything by trying it out, it's not a waste of time!"
17515,Awesome game.
17516,This is the best game I have ever played.

8/10"
17518,"I think this game has the potential to become something worth playing but at the moment it just gets frustrating. I've been looking for something to replace CS/CoD and this could be it eventually.

One of the biggest things at the moment, every map I've played so far feels like an aim_map. Spawn camping in TDM is horrible if you get put on a team that doesn't watch eachothers backs.

Overall it's not terrible for early access but the map design is in desperate need of a rework, it's hard to judge the rest of the game when you're stuck on such terrible maps."

17523,super fun game better then csgo no lagS!
17524,too many cheat dog.
17525,Best f2p fps game at the moment  worth a try.
17526,"The game  has a horrible interface where you'll need some time to find your stuff. Totally outdated in regards of design aspects. Same with the launcher. I've seen games using such a  launcher  seven or eight years ago.

Graphics are ok, could be better but also worse for 2018. However for a competitive shooter still better than CS (lol).

Matchmaking is  slightly broken at the moment, but that might also be the result of how many players the game currently has. Especially a problem in the competitive mode since even less ppl play that.

Regarding gameplay, the Unreal Engine is a nice thing to have. Still, I had these moments in the game where I thought ""how is it even possible to get hit by that?"". Just those weird situations which don't make sense. 

Physics are comparable to COD since you'll often times just spray and pray in closer fights. That also means that even in the Demolition game mode (bomb defusing) games become less tactical compared to CS.

F2P concept behind the game is that you'll need some time to unlock all the weapons,  you'll only have a couple of them when starting. 

As far as I have seen it, the game is absolutely not P2W because you'll get access to the good weapons (but grinding is part of it). Also, character models etc dont give any additional ingame boosts that might favor players who bought them.

To sum it up this shooter is surely not for everyone but it's free and still in development, so you might try it and then personally decide whether or not you like it."
17527,GreaT game! Love it!
17528,"Nice game. love it. no p2w stuff. Willing to put in hours to grind. 

But 1 weird thing is i cant seem to get games nowadays. Any help? 

I am playing in Singapore. 

Thank you."
17529,Bad map designs and gameplay can be improved. But with a bit of work it does have some potential.
17530,really good
17531,+
17532,"gunplay fun and overall fun
however whoever is in charge of designing the maps has no idea what he or she is doing at all
the maps in this game are all horribly designed please fix"
17533,"First off, unlike what the Store description says, this is [b]NOT[/b] the best Free-To-Play shooter. This game can't even grasp the idea of ""Best Free-To-Play shooter."" This game is a newborn child compared to the galaxy that is the ""Best Free-To-Play shooter."" The gunplay in this game is very, very poor. Weapons only seem to be entirely accurate when you're standing still, no matter if you have a scope attached or not. There's really no need for the scopes when every gun is basically 100% accurate, all you have to do is have the enemy in your crosshair and there's a stupidly huge chance you'll hit them. Now, this can all be looked over, if it weren't for one HUGE flaw.

The maps are borderline awful.
Each team has a fixed spawning zone, and upon spawn, you get a brief invinsibility shield. Not bad, that really helps counter spawn-campers. Well, it's a complete annoyance when the maps are smaller than a church. Before you know it, you'll have killed an enemy, rounded a corner, and be faced with the same enemy who has invincibility while you do not, and there's no chance of you surviving that, especially when the spawning is so rapid that you'll eventually round a corner and have three or four people with invinsibility running towards you, and all you can do at that point is be really, really sad. In this sense, the miniscule size of the maps definitely promotes turtling, as no matter what, you'll eventually wander into the enemy's spawn.

There's no need for Snipers, because all weapons have 100% accuracy no matter what the distance is, so people will be able to hit you from lengths that are insanely annoying. Imagine rounding a corner and seeing someone about two-hundred feet away, only for you to hit them, it somehow miss, and they turn around and shoot you dead with one shot from a Desert Eagle.

This game was never fun while I played it.
It's not a fun game.

Did I mention most guns cost around 90,000 - 160,000 gold, and after each game you get only somewhere around 1,000? 


In Conclusion:
play this game if you really want to
beat it over the head for a few hours hoping to have some form of fun
or don't play it

[i]It's your choice, and you're not losing a dime in the process[/i]"
17534,"I only have about a half hour into the game and its pretty decent. Normally i don't enjoy f2p games where you usually have to ""rent"" the weapons, but they start you with enough money to get at least a little creative in what you might be interested in. It's basically cod and cs:go had a lovechild that combines elements of both to create an experience that functions very well for casual play, but also has that tinge to its gameplay that welcomes people to master it. It's not perfect right now (still some things left to be desired like game modes and the need for a much fairer/accessible cosmetic system) but its not a bad play. My main recommendations are just that they should add more game modes/player character and loadout customization and possibly a PvA.I. version of the multiplayer. I like to be an advocate for the people out there who are scared away from pvp centric games because communities tend to be very judgemental and unwelcoming, and i do believe that the player count for this game could totally jump if they do what For Honor did and include PvA.I. versions of multiplayer game modes while still rewarding players for playing it as it encourages people to learn the game, as well as reward learning as well as at least attempting to play the game in some form."

17537,Awesome CS and COD game
17538,"Good game in general. 
Tho many down side so I dont recommend. 
-Sexist (you have to PAY to be a girl ingame.. wtf)
-Lootboxes are OBVIOUSLY rigged 
(You can get for 1times 1200cash bullets for 99cents, 
So I spent it on lootboxes. opened about 10 of them. Never ANYTHING from the 5 items I wanted 
There are ONLY 10 items in the box. so I had 1/2 chances to get them NORMALY.. F*ck you BlackSquad.)
FOR THIS reason I DO NOT recomend this game.
NEVER EVER Put any money in the game, You can try it, 99Cents to get screwed up happens everydays lol. 
Do it if you want and you will see, the loot system is retarded.
Now I have 600 USELESS Bcoins that I CAN NOT USE if I dont PAY-TO-LOOT AGAIN. F*ck you blacksquad again. 
This is retarded and they can be sued over that TBH. 
ITS NOT like the ""Normal"" loot system that is in hot-water lately lol.. its damn worst.
2 out of 10 items are ""BCoins"" that you can ONLY get from Lootbox that cost irl money.
Those BCoins are used to buy exclusive in the BC shop. THO theres NO way you can get those coins out of THOSE boxes.
Its totally retarded.

17547,"black squad is a game where you are in a 5v5 match. This game is like counter strike but I havent encountered any cheaters yet. The game doesnt have any kind of movement inaccuracy like counter strike which makes the game alot more casual which isnt a bad thing.
In the beginning of every round you dont buy weapons you actually have them in a kit that you made and you can edit and thats also where the microtransactions come in. The 
 microtransactions are really fair. You can get every gun with normal money or medals that you can earn or you could just buy them. Getting medals and money is easy and you just get them from playing.
Really good f2p game if you would like something thats more casual than cs."

Low on sys requirements.
Servers are all good no matter what continent you choose
Guns are so satisfying to shoot and the crack of the headshot is epic!
Never seen so much free stuff with a F2P! WoW! you guys are amazing.

There are a few glitches here n there, but I'm sure they'll be fixed when the game launches.
Most of my problems were probably caused due to low ping so not really developers fault.
Maps sometimes feel kinda small for 8 v 8 
Spawn kills are bleh.. no escape for multiple deaths sometimes.

17559,"First off, before I say anything, this game is amazing. Sure theres other games that you could play like Team Fortress 2, Fortnite, Roblox (if you like that stuff), but in my opinion, this one destoys almost everyone of them (except fortnite). The game's sounds are very crisp, no cheaters so far, not p2w, and fun gamemodes. There are a few cons I managed to fine though. I believe the community is pretty small, so that could be a con. The maps are also not as good as they could be. I guess there could also be more guns and designs. Thats all I have for cons. I recommend this to everyone because its so good that it even tops some popular shooters that cost money."

17565,"this game is so fucking retarded, first of all the fucking retards are playing this game, second it is so fucking shit, the maps are fucking garbage, its very very shit, dont download this crap"
17566,"Nice little F2P FPS. Black Squad is essentially Combat Arms without the ridiculous limits on purchased weapons, as almost all items in the store are permanent and relatively easily acquired. The game rewards you with the secondary currency fairly frequently (namely after daily challenges, leveling up, and daily login reward) which allows you to buy the more exclusive weapons. In other words, some of the more powerful weapons. Daily login rewards do not require you to hop on every day to track, so the game does not force you to log on every day to recieve the rewards.

PROS:
-Great fun for a simple multiplayer FPS
-Several game modes
-Many maps
-Large selection of weapons to choose from
-Does not force you to spend money to get good gear
-Plays fluidly and feels great to play overall
-Most weapons are balanced fairly (for example, the M107 is one-shot-one-kill, but you cannot move with it, because if you do, the bullet will be sent into the ceiling or the floor)

CONS:
-Poor map design, is very easy to be spawn camped on certain sides of certain maps
-[strike]You cannot change loadouts once you have picked one and spawned[/strike]
-Slight P2W elements, though they are not nearly as present as most other games
-Balance can be a little iffy at times, some weapons are insanely accurate, for instance

Give it a go if you want simple multiplayer FPS fun. I am having an absolute blast with Black Squad.

Edit: You CAN change loadouts after spawning, you just need to use F1-F3."

2. Very nice visuals/graphics, but still needs a limit FPS option.
3. Microtransactions only get you guns with pretty skins/vinyls. stats of the same guns remain similar.
4. Populated servers.
5. All weapons in the game are purchasable with in-game currency, there are no exclusive weapons only purchasable with microtransactions.
6. Wide variety of weapons to choose from.
7. Free DLC weapon packs to let players test out almost all weapons in the game for 15 days.
8. Simple, straightforward, and easy to play.
9. BattleEye support, best anti-cheat engine.
10. Pure skills, no bullshit."

It's basically like CS GO.  Needs some more maps and balancing, as well as gun balances (snipers are a little OP atm and everyone camps with them)."
17592,A poor man's CS:GO.
17593,"one of the best korean f2p shooters ever released tbh, they're not kidding when they say absolutely no p2w. also the netcode is actually good, which is pretty unheard of in f2p shooters."

kudos to the team

however DLC are priced a little bit higher 
its costs a huge fortune to buy the dlc from india
there are so many potential buyers in india if the price comes down

17595,Fun
17596,"While my playtime is pretty laughable, I actually rather enjoy Black Squad. It definitely feels more arcade-ish compared to something like CS:GO, and it isn't as rage-inducing as said game. It's more fast paced, has a healthy weapon variety, and I don't get the great feel of the pay-to-win meta that's been plaguing games as of late. There are some weapons that are [b]clearly[/b] better than the others, but it's not like you can't get kills with starting weaponry (that and they throw in a free starter's DLC for a chance of a decent weapon, so that's pretty cool).

At the moment, I don't have any other cons apart from connectivity. It's pretty upsetting that I have 100+ ms lag playing on the west coast of the US. For me, that's kind of unacceptable, and I hope that the development team behind the game work to implement more servers over time. 

All in all, I do really like this game. It has a long way to go still, but for where it is at the present time, I'm very content with the experience."
17597,"Good that they let you buy 2 guns for free, but holy hell is the gameplay bad. The gun's recoil is randomest shit, and the hit detection is horrible. The control is so wonky and... not smoouth, it's just horrendous. The female character also moves like 3x faster than your free male model (probably because they are skinnier). Thanks, but no thanks. Suprising amount of positive review for this game, honestly."
17598,"Very bad F2P game.


Abysmal Hit Detection (Someone shoots you in the toe? Nah m8, he hit you straight in the head!)
Awful Sensetivity (Literally almost 12% sensetivity)
Terrible Bullet-Logic (22 LR instantly one-shots you, but 20 5.56 does nothing.)
Flak Jacket (Just..Doesn't work, at all.)
Disgusting Grenades (A free free-kill weapon.)


Overall, its a unfun, strict, and bad game."

17601,"I play this game like it's life or death, if I die in the game I inject myself with grinded up coffee beans and can smell colors afterward, this can sometimes give me huge boosts in the game. On level 60 now, moving up every day.

17603,"Too much lag, could be a great game but it's badly implemented,Not recomenden at all"
17604,"This game is nice if i want to play an online shooter but i don't have too much time
My main problem are the TDM maps there are maps where one of the teams have advantages with better sniping points or being able to sneak and knife the entire team (its incredibly easy to do that smoke grenades are your friends.... apparently makes you totally invisible to the enemy team!) 
some maps has so many sniping points where there is only one way to go if you wanna go with auto rifles smg or shotguns

Overall the game is awesome but needs better tdm maps 
you either sniping or going all rambo until you die"
17605,It's very good and fun aswell it's free to play so I recommend it!

17607,When i try to get in a tdm match my game always close itself down any help to solve this issue?
17608,"Very fun game to play.Before this i played Cs.Go for more than 4 years.
I think this game is better than anything else on steam.It's free,AND it's not pay 2 win!! You can buy skins if you want,but that's only for visual.Really like it.
You are still reading this ? Go and download the game.It's fun ;)."
17609,"not recommended

Pros:
- great gunplay (even if i would have loved a TTK a bit higher but that's just personal preference)
- not so reliant on timings and whatever usually hinders the gunplay in other popular shooters.


Cons: 
- poor map design.
- WAY too much grenades/launcher ammo, way too much. actually ruining the great gunplay.
- sound is not so accurate.
- skins.. i mean not just weapon skins (which have no impact on gameplay) but character skins, that's probably the worst idea ever in an fps, since it takes you a bit longer to recognize if it's actually an ennemy or an ally, sometimes makes the difference between a kill and a death. not mentioning that it actually makes the game a (light) P2W.

so it's still a good game if you just wanna play a little bit for fun, an hour here and there, but the game actually prevents you from playing it seriously like you would on CS. which is sad because the gunplay is much better in blacksquad."

17616,otimo jogo roda no meu pc lixo sem placa de video então esse jogo alem de ser bom e bonito e muito bom jogar solo ou com amigos recomendo bagarai
17617,this game runs well is fun looks good however voice acting isnt good and it should be esyer to play with frends however you start of with good guns.
17618,This is a very organized and easy to learn game. Great community and playability. Keep it up and listen to your users!!! And don't get greedy! Thats what happened to Alliance of Valiant Arms.
17619,BEST GAME EVER you do not need to pay to win and also unlike other free titles you can actually use your earned currency to buy most (almost all) weapons and keep them PERMANENTLY without having to buy currency. this game reminds me of call of duty mixed with counter strike. also SOOOO ADDICTING. I want to thank this develepor for making such a good game.
17620,"Very great game, especially for someone with a low spec PC or someone who just wants a free competitive FPS. No Pay-to-Win system and I have seen only one hacker at most. Most of the negative reviews (excluding a few who use actual reasons) are just from people who have 0.1-2 hours in the game and are terrible at said game - disregard them.

However, I will list some cons. The game's maps are mediocre, the snipers need nerfing (honestly overused in Demolition), and there is no support for the Steam marketplace regarding gun skins. Finally, there is a lack of ranked matchmaking (not including clans, although clan matchmaking sometimes pits Lvl. 0 clans with Lvl. 2 clans).

In general, this game is very fun to play and you can unlock a lot in a little time. However, I propose the game have a ranked match mode to allow lower skill players to play with people on their skill level; this is the same for high skill players. This, in turn, could attract other players due to the presence of skill-based progression similar to CSGO and R6. It would take time to implement but it would sure as hell be fun for the players and bring in business for the company."
17621,THIS GAME IS SOME FUCKING TRASH ON BD MY NIGGA
17622,"Pay to win.  Tight mechanics and fast speed - I am top 2-3 each game with vanilla items, but man, this model is such an insult to gamers."
17623,Fun & Fast paced. Like call of duty except without being a part of the toxicity. Balanced maps. Balanced guns. in-game micro transactions aren't pushed on you & it's not a pay to win game.
17624,Very nice game with a lot of potential!
17625,This is the worst game I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Cannot recommend this game to anyone with money and a taste in video games.
17626,G
17627,"Unlike most of Asian shooters, Black Squad actually takes care of really important aspects that a good shooter needs, however, it still misses few of them.

This game once failed in Korea, but now that the developers have seen the reasons of its failure, they relaunched it globaly and are listening to community with its development and its been working out quite well. This is a good example how much game can improve if developers listen to community.
---
I think this is the only Asian shooter that isn't pay to win. Its really a breath of fresh air seeing that there arent any VIP tiers or people with super shiny guns that outperform any weapon you own (..well there are actually some shiny guns, or rather skins but they are completely cosmetic). All the weapons are acquirable by playing, and they are relatively not that hard to unlock, you can unlock them by spending currency you gain by leveling up, so you have your own freedom of choice. Also devs were so nice they even gave us 3 steam DLCs where you can try almost all the guns for free for 15 days.
Most guns also have additional equipment: grenade launchers, lasers and silencers, but they come preinstalled on every gun so you dont need pay for them. All the guns can use iron sights/ scopes 

Netcode is pretty good, i didnt feel any lags so far or inconveniences, and shooting felt fine. There are even hitmarks and satisfying headshot sounds. People arent too tanky and there no armors (like in original version), so its pretty easy to get a kill with any weapon.

Decent number of maps, but surprisingly low amount of game modes for this type of game. Demolition, Team Deathmatch and ""Battlematch"". Battlematch is a special mode where you can pick one of four classes and earn points to call in airstrikes or place turrets and such, it is nice once in a while to take a rest from Demolition.

There are 4 currencies: Gold (mostly useless, but you can purchase some basic guns with it), Medals (currency you gain by leveling up, used in medal shop for buying meta weapons), Bullets and Black Squad coins (donator currency for skins). There is no gun repair system or any annoying stuff like that will waste your money.

Devs are nice and stream every week, they listen to community and fixed a lot of things they were asked to, they seem to really care about this game and its going well so far. Anticheat seems to work good since and i dont remember seeing any cheaters around.

My biggest issue with this game is that it doesnt have ranked mode, at least for queuing alone, to play competitive you need clan. This game has much potential to go for Esports, or at least small tournaments at start. It also doesnt do much new stuff, lacks game modes and stronger progression system (there is only simple grind for money) which makes it get boring really fast. All the skins are locked behind donator currency and further locked behind lootboxes, which makes them really hard to acquire, and completely unobtainable by free to play players. Hopefully this system will get better if they put skins into steam trading.

Im waiting for ranked mode so i can get into game more competitively, so far it gets boring pretty fast, despite all the good aspects it has.

Pros:
- Non pay to win, all the weapons acquirable for free (even knives)
- Devs are listening to community
- Big playerbase
- Good netcode and anticheat
- Shooting feels good and is fast to get used to
- Permanent weapons
- Free steam DLCs
- Few gun modifications
- Crosshair editor

Cons:
- Doesnt offer much new stuff
- Only 3 game modes
- Lacks customization
- No solo ranked mode, must play as a clan
- You cant buy skins directly, you must unlock them from lootboxes
- Could use better progression system, it gets grindy later on
- Gets boring fast
- Personally i dislike design of certain maps"
17628,such a refreshing fps. like csgo when it was new and growing. plan to play for many many hours. will definitely be buying skins lmao

17630,The best FTP game to play out on steam.
17631,i recommend everyone to play this game :D its really good  and not pay-to-win. feels between CS and COD.
17632,Awesomely fun!
17633,this is a well made game with great weapons along the way. if people are against this incredible game i dont know why.
17634,This Game I so F**** trash R.I.P AIMING pay 2 win wtf fps 99999999 ping
17635,"This game is definitely worth a try for anyone who enjoyed Counter Strike, COD4, or any similar old time shooters. Honesty, didn't expect much from a F2P, but I've been pleasantly suprised with this game. There's absolutely no pay to win features(unless for some reason you consider cosmetics pay to win), the maps are small but balanced(To those complaining about snipers, the maps are clearly split into different areas with different lanes, there's a cross-map lane for snipers, and usually along the left and right hand sides of the maps there is a CQC or rifle-range area for those who dont enjoy sniping). The game is extremely fast paced, and the matches aren't long, so it's a pretty relaxed, enjoyable game to play."
17636,Game feels terrible
17637,"If you get past the fact that the game is basically pay to win (you can buy in game currency to spped the procces up a lot). And the infestation of cheaters in the game it actally a very fun game at its core. gun mechanics are great but you seen to always spawn with one bullet less in your magazine. There is also an issue with hit registration which could be either the hitboxes on players, the tick rate on the server or my latency. As there are no servers in Oceania I am forced to play on servers with 150 ping+. Again great game but could be better if more tim was put into it"

17662,"Well, not a big fan of CoD, but been with CS since beta6 coming from ActionQuake 2, I can only say that this is a suprisingly refreshing experience. I, however, have to agree with one of my predecessors writing a review: It sort of is p2w. Nades are valueable, important gear that you must 'lease for a few days' and the time you would need to invest to get to major upgrades without paying up is wisely calculated so that you either lose interest in the game and thus stop being a freeloader or rather freegamer or start to produce some revenue.

The pace of the TDM mode actually reminds me of the good ol' days of early tactical fps mods using quake, hl or unreal as engine...which is sort of a nice thing for me personally, but could this vague resemblence also have something to do with a certain lack of innovation and mature game design? You'll be the judge of that. Cheers and hf!"
17663,Was really skeptical how this game would be before downloading. But after downloading its worth it.
17664,It's unbalanced game with bad system of matchmaking. You can even play with players who have much bigger rank than you.

17667,Can you make DLC for M4 custom gl yellow dragon plssss!and i wish items for blacksquad can be trade hmmmm.
17668,"a mediocre fps, too mediocre"
17669,"I really enjoy the game so far. The mechanics of the game is quite good. It's almost like CSGO but the skill-level and learning is easier. 

Pros
-Good variety of weapons
-Nice skins
-Love the daily rewards 
-Easy to learn and play

Cons
-Some of the weapons feel too underpowerd. Some of them takes too many bullets to kill a guy and you can't even get a one tap on the head.
-The maps are TOO big. Anyone that plays CSGO will hate this. Map rotations are important for the defending side and when your A and B site are so far apart. All you need is one good rush on one site and you win the game basically. 
-Learning the map is the hardest for me to be honest.
-64 ticks server. Sometimes you bullets don't register. If you can make it better then you just beat CSGO on that.
-Unless you want the game to be a run and gun type then I suggest you make running while shooting less accurate. 
-Jumping shots needs a nerf. No idea how many times I kill a guy while jumping and spamming my ACR

I understand this is sitll not the fully develope version and I hope all this can be fix but all in all its a good game. You do need more game modes though. Some zombies would be nice :D"
17670,x
17671,"This game could appeal to some, but to me it's just unfun and annoying. It's not competitive at all. It plays like a crappier CS:GO clone, and I personally despise Counter Strike to begin with.

Pros:
* Good weapon variety
* Runs smoothly, well optimized
* Good animation quality

Cons:
* Unfun and generally unskillful gameplay centered on being a Counter Strike clone.
* There is no point to aiming down your sights
* Huge weapon disparity, with some having insane recoil, and others having none at all.
* Weapons feel like wet noodles, taking countless shots.
* Counter Strike 'only headshots matter' gameplay.
* No anti-cheat
* No weapon customization

Honestly I felt cheated in just about every engagement I fought in. I spotted target, I fired first, hit the target, die because the target happened to get a headshot. It takes so many shots to kill someone without that golden headshot. I remember hitting one guy with 5 shotgun blasts to his torso from not even 6 feet away, only for him to kill me with 3% life remaining. Due to the fact that this follows the annoying 'Only Headshots Matter' rule that Counter Strike put down ages ago, and the fact that it has a crosshair with almost no recoil (on some weapons), there is utterly no purpose to aiming. Just keep your crosshair at 'eye level' and spray when you see someone. Some people may find this fun, I don't.

There is no sprint button, like CS:GO everyone walks at the same speed in any direction, so you get that 'corner peaking' nonsense that occurs in CS. Some like it, I don't.

Hackers also very clearly dominate this game. It's also running that petty Combat-Arms type system where you buy things with varying types of in-game currency of varying levels of rarity, or you can just buy things with real money. It has 0 weapon customization, despite having a huge variety of weapons. Apparently people these days are terrified of iron sights, as I count only 1 assault rifle in the entire game that isn't decked out in 400 pounds of attachments, which makes me long for just a plain old rifle that I can customize how *I* want (I've always preferred iron sights to holo-nonsense and red dots, but clearly we live in the Call of Duty age where even WWII veterans apparently had red dot sights on their bolt actions).

Tl;dr - If you like the dumb Counter Strike style of gameplay, go buy Counter Strike. If like CS but are in the mood for a janky, less realized, and hacker-dominated version? Feel free to play this. If not, I wouldn't play it."
17672,"Good game. Small maps and some spawn camping gets annoying. Still fun though. Not sure about a few players I faced, it's like they never miss with sniper weapons.

I like the game. It passes time well and is generally pretty fun. I love the weapon selection and the online multiplayer variety."
17673,very nice
17674,A seriously fun F2P FPS in the market. The devs are great and they keep contact on the community. Great game all in all 10/10 would recommend to my friends
17675,IT'S SHIET JUST SPRAY AND PAY THEN WIN
17676,"Game is amazing to play from time to time when I get bored, but I don't fully understand why the devs absolutely hate controllers. Bummed I can't play it with my xbox controllers as I like to relax and play fps's with my controller. Oh well, game will probably die in a month anyways."
17677,"Good game, nothing more I can say"
17678,"I´m really impressed. For F2P, this is awesome. I haven't played it yet so much, but I enjoyed it still.  I really recommend this game to everyone who're interested about good FPS games."

17680,its a fun competitive game to play with freinds
17681,Good alternative and balance. fun to play and apsolutly not a pay to win game!
17682,"This is my second review on this game since january.

When I first started playing this game this is what I saw in it :

Pros

Great game overall, not p2w AT ALL, good graphics, good sounds, lots of blood.

Cons

No matchmaking system, maps could be better.

Really thats it, if you want a decent ftp (absolutely not p2w in any way unless you count cosmetics as an advantage lol) fps shooter this is definitely your game.

February review update :

Sometimes (but more times very often), when you try to join a Quick Match, you will enter a match in progress, (today I've joined 7 matches in progress in a row, on the losing team, 5-8 rounds had already been played by the time I joined the match) and that is very frustrating since we can't do anything about it, please devs lock matches that are already half-way completed (I think the best idea is to make it so when 4 or more rounds have already finished, that match will no longer be available to join, no matter if any player left, and if a player leaves the match after the 4th round has ended, he gets a ban for sometime or at least some kind of penalty like banning from quick matches for sometime or banning his favourite weapons for sometime or just something bigger than the current penalty just to give them a lesson, because nobody cares about current penalty, starting from me really).

After the last update (patch 18) my ping has doubled, the time it takes to join a quick match has gone from 5-10 second to 1-3 minutes (for me at least), there are still no new maps or improvements of the current ones, devs please start focusing on more important things than Spectator Camera, Lunar New Year and Valentines Day skins, that stuff does not make the game any more/less enjoyable than it already is, since the first time I started playing this game there is still no improvements in anyway. Also please let us specify the maps we want to join in quick match!

And also, I TRULY LOVE THIS GAME, and like any other game of course it has its own flaws but I'm sure you can and will crush those flaws one by one with time, and thats why I still recommend this game since it still is very fun to play but could be a whole lot better than it currently is!

Thank you."
17683,MAKE THE RUNNING SYSTEM BETTER
17684,"The maps are a little simple and repetitive and the look of the game is very generic, it reminds me of Crossfire. 

On the other hand, the guns are permanent, it loads super smoothly on low operating systems, has stunning graphics, is a ton of fun altogether, and of course. . . IT'S FREE! 

It's not perfect, but for a free FPS game, it is definitely worth checking out."
17685,Need changeable nickname!!!
17686,"actually fun to play, reminds me of cod. movement and hitboxes could be improved."
17687,"It's really a very wonderful game
But if there is a new map of the assassination, it will be the best.."
17688,"It's a fun game to play. It does take some time to get used to. Especially the weapons. Getting long range kills can be difficult but with the right weapons it gets easier. 

Good thing about the game is that a lot of the weapons are free and can be obtained with coins or medals. Spending money on the game is optional but the 1 dollar deal for 1200 currency is a great deal to get some better weapons like the AK12.

Maps are a bit boring though, especially in TDM. The Search and Destroy maps are bigger but feel a bit weird. 

Can't wait to see how this game develops."

17701,"it's a mindless shoot-em-up. it's free. so i'd say it's only good if you are needing something to play while your main games are updating or needing to burn 8-10 mins on something fast. it's a pay to win. all the good guns, armor and accessories are all player cash. download if you must, i've already uninstalled it. not worth my time."

17708,GREAT GAME
17709,"Black Squad is a neat arcade multiplayer FPS, featuring familiar gameplay to CS:GO. Here's a summary:

[h1]Positives[/h1]
-Great variety of original weapons to choose from all around the world, from the rare American SR-47 to the famous Chinese QBZ-97 rifle. 
-Very decent graphics.
-Thrilling and fast-paced gameplay.
-It's free.
[h1]Negatives[/h1]
-Poor optimization, performance issues are frequently reported in the forums.
-Awkwardly designed maps with obvious chokepoints and repetitive gameplay.
-Many of the weapons are paid DLCs.
-Sporadic balancing issues, such as one-sided maps and overpowered weapons.

Overall, the game is a damn blast (when you're winning), and offers a great, cheap alternative to CS:GO, especially for our fellow bankrupt comrades who can't afford it. It's a neat F2P game that's guaranteed to bring you at least three minutes of fun, so why not?"
17710,i absoulutely love it keep up the good work!
17711,"i got blue screen of death once when i launched

never tried again"
17712,"Eh, great concept, horrible execution. First off, the balancing is way off, snipers are obviously better by a landslide and you can't enter a server without half of the people on a team abusing that. New to the game? The game screws you over, giving you horrible setups, and the tutorial only provides basic info, not good tips on how to navigate the menu, what certain things do, etc. Pretty much, this game sucks if you're new to it, and I understand that, but there should be an easier learning curve, or even just fairer match making for lower levels. This game throws you in the middle of a squad of tryhards and expects you to pick up a weapon and just go. I could see myself playing the game more if they changed things around, but as of now I don't really like it.

TLDR; This game is kind of P2W, snipers are the best class and there are campers galore. If you want a decent FPS that looks great and is light on more computers, try Warface. Same concept, better execution."
17713,NOt bad
17714,Good Game
17715,"Rainbow Six for gamers without money - free to play competitive tactical shooter developed in Korea with the goal of not offering an edge to those who chose to support the game with money.

The servers are legit bulshit - lags and log out problems"

what are you waiting for
go play it"
17717,"well at first i didnt care for it honestly but i decided to give it another shot and im glad i did its a dam good game imo i hands down like it better than recent cod installments lmao...also its free to play and no pay to when elements its only cosmetics and exp/gold boost which add's no advantage really

10/10 i recommend this game"
17718,"Great game so far but ruined by microtransactions and uninspired small maps. Seriously, there's three maps that all play and look the same. Some modes are dead, TDM and Demolition seem to be the only two still kicking but it's good casual fun. So I'll give it that."
17719,"This is a fun game. If you can't afford CS:GO this is definitely the game for you. Wish they had an Australian server.

Edit: This game is really worthy of winning an award for the gameplay and graphics used. From what I've heard, the developers are really inclined to listen to the community and implement changes discussed."
17720,"Feels like it is pay-to-win. You either can spend loads of time grinding currency for good weapons that clearly outmatch the starters, or you can pan ten bucks, get a booster, and buy yourself a one shot one kill sniper or the best gun in the game otherwise. 

My other major complaint is it isn't competetive. Matches are pretty much decided on which team can get to certain places first. By this, I mean people have turned the game into Camping Squad instead of Black Squad. You can sit in one of numerous positions on any map and never be contested, winning games left and right by margins of approximately one third (in TDM) or a hundred thousand points (in Demolition). This raises another point, which is the game is literally pushed towards team deathmatch so much that even if you try to lobby in another game mode, it either turns into a team deathmatch scenario or it becomes unplayable because players join so slowly and by the time each team is full, one or the other has a massive lead in score and there is so little time that ""clutching"" is irrelevant and hopeless. I was looking forward to some of the bigger game modes like Demolition and Battle Match. In Demolition queues, the match is decided who gets more kills and it's a race to see who can unlock the juggernaut first. It makes you pretty much invincible and you get a minigun so you can literally just stand at one objective and hopld the mouse button to win. In about five minutes, you'll die from getting grenaded from people respawning so much but you usually have enough kills and points to get another one immediately upon respawn. In the Battle Match, LITERALLY NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE EVEN QUEUE UP FOR IT!!!! 

If you want to fix the game, I would say nerf snipers and shotguns or don't make players die in three shots/don't make rifle choices so decisive of what's clearly better. For the love of God nerf juggernauts in Demolition, or encourage players to choose other classes. Finally, FOR THE LOVE OF LITERALLY EVERYTHING HOLY ENCOURAGE THE PLAY OF OTHER GAMEMODES THAT MAKE THE GAME UNIQUE!!!

Otherwise, it is literally, a poor man's Call of Duty Multiplayer."
17721,"Let me just start off by saying that this game is one of my all-time favorite First Person Shooters on Steam. The gunplay is absolutely the greatest thing you'll ever experience, simply shooting an enemy is satisfying. The weapons are vast, and they give you enough free things to start with that you can get a few easily. The maps are large, with various designs to make sure the players are never bored, because there's always something new. Skins exist, but only add cosmetic value, and most of them look extra good. There's even a sandbox that lets you use an ingame stopwatch, spawn and delete enemies, and choose a map freely. There are cons (like microtransactions allowing people to get more guns) but as I said, you start with enough to choose your own gun for free."
17722,"An a ok game, I agree this game is fun to play but I wouldn't prefer it over CS:GO. Also sadly this doesn't have Oceania severs witch means i have to go on american/europian severs and have like 300/200 ping."
17723,lol is this a joke?
17724,"Barely playable. Terrible map designs, terrrible music, terrible gunplay, you can get to level 50 in two or three matches. Don't bother, not even for free."

17734,"The North American and EU servers are pretty much dead all the time, if you really wanna get the actual full exp of the game its recommennded that you're from the SEA region cause thats where most of the Black Squad is kickin in. Experienced players to a shit ton of servers! 
The game by itself is amazing from its graphics and its existing community (not yet toxic). Pretty easy and fun to pickup.
10/10 would buy it, if it was priced."

still real good tho"
17736,"Back in the time items were marketable/tradable and everyone was there to participate in events for juicy skins and maybe the money, after some stupid patches they decided to stop releasing marketable items and guess what! One of the most active Games/Markets of steam died.

17737,Excellent game with new content released monthly.  I enjoy the maps and balance that consists on every area of thought.  Great job Black Squad team!

17742,s
17743,This is a really bad fps game. The concept is good but it's not a good game. The ui is ugly and laggy and the game is way too easy. Worse than Call of Duty. No skill required.
17744,Wasn't sure if I was playing a bot game or not
17745,there is no reason for anyone to subject themselves to this game
17746,make OCE server's plz
17747,Its not call of duty without kealstreaks. :) 2/10
17748,"Mediocre game at best,save yourself the trouble and buy CSGO instead,this one will be like all other free to play fps IT WILL end dead in 2 years top like A.V.A,Combat Arms,Crossfire and many others,all of then claiming to be the best f2p game but all failed to deliver and all had the same fate extremly low population and infested with cheaters

- The bad
if you have high ping compared to other players you are at advantage
wallhackers (rampant)
aimbotters
no chat moderation whatsoever or any filter


- The good
sniper kills in one hit
weapons are somewhat cheap
perk system"
17749,fun.
17750,"Really fun game!! Great mix between cod and cs and great for people who are new to the whole pc scene. has great aspects of cod black ops 2 but slower paste and not as fast as movement!
"
17751,"Tried a few games and even with good internet on the right server I was getting lag spikes.
And anything except TDM was totally barren for me."
17752,yes
17753,This game is a really weird mix of brainless CoD and (somewhat) tactical CS:GO that makes for surprisingly fun gameplay
17754,3rd best game
17755,"This game works as fine even though its an early access game.
"
17756,"This brought me back to CoD4 days. Really fluid FPS action to chill from time to time. The gameplay includes elements from almost every popular FPS games out there. I don't see any reason to pay a dime in this game. No overpowered P2W guns or anything. The only thing that bothered me while playing this game was that the playerbase consists mostly of kids and young teens. If you're an FPS veteran, your heart will break after going 10:0 on that one particular kid."
17757,"A trash game with horrible sound system and randomly freezing screen on 3 PCs with 3 different configurations,no matter what hardware,drivers or system I used.
What's even more infuriating there's no possibility to report other players,what leads to awesome situations when a guy is taking down 3 players,walking out from 3 different corners of the map,one by one,simply just waiting for them to  appear on his crosshair."
17758,"Sickest game ever, get high ping but still good reg. Recommend"
17759,I like how it's not pay to win. It's like counter strikes younger brother when it comes to gameplay.
17760,"Had to install to see why it has around 10k players online.
Uninstalled.
10 years ago games like this where a hype and where over produced, just no clue why the fuck a company would waste resources into making one of those nowdays. Guess if you want to bring back some old memories it might be fun, or when you have a computer running on Windows 2000."
17761,I Like This Game Its Good But Its Guddestt!!!
17762,"If Counter Strike 1.6 and Counter Strike Global Offensive could have babies, then Black Squad would be one of them.
It has the smoothness of 1.6 with the graphics of Global Offensive.
The extra modes of battle makes it even more interesting.
I highly recommend it, I am madly in love with it."
17763,very cool
17764,Awesome game.
17765,Thats my love
17766,its trash
17767,nice
17768,nice
17769,i Fucking hate this game and i only played one match even the fuckin tutorial was pathetic
17770,very fun
17771,"Very similar to Sudden Attack, a popular Korean FPS shooter. Anywho, the game's pretty nifty and quick - definitely not for the faint-hearted."
17772,"One of the best F2P FPS games out there in the store. It's basically a combination of call of duty and counter strike in one game, most people say its pay to win but in my opinion these people are just lazy to grind levels to get the medals and spend them in medal shop and getting the best guns like (AK-47 GL or AK12). In my opinion the game is worth giving a try and can be a challenge for people who like getting achievements since it requires alot of time and dedication to get them"
17773,Fucking LIT game
17774,"Like a mobile game, garbage"
17775,Full of Cheaters... Dont download...
17776,"I really enjoy this game. It has a few flaws but overall it feels like a nearly-perfect combination if COD and CS:GO.
And the battle mode is just insane fun for a free to play game. My only real annoyance is that there are no australian servers, so your ping may be quite high if you live in Australia or New Zealand which doesnt bother me that much because im really not a competitive player, but I know its important to a lot of players.

But this is my favourite FPS right now, so I would definitely recommend it.

If you want to see some gameplay there is some on my YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixvbPR3vMtY&t=4s"
17777,"This is a very well balanced games. The matchs can be short or long depending how well you team works together and how well you chose to play. If you love battlefeild I suggest getting this game. I feel like this takes everything great about a online shooter but leaves out the bullshit that call of duty tried to do with AV and IV. Maps are very easy to remeber but I do have on problem with the game, that would be the the grind to get in game cash to get new guns. It seems to take to long. Other then that no problem"
17778,"WHY WHEN I PLAY AFTER 5 MINUTS SHOW ME MASSAGE SAID WHATB IS THE KEY 00000
"
17779,THIS SHIT IS GOOOOOOOOOOOOD
17780,"Game is not bad but they need to fix the shotguns and tomahawks. both weapons should not lose in close range but majority of the time they do. It should be with the shotgun if youre at a close enough distanceit should be one shot kill since shotguns are made for cqc. The tomahawk should be a one shot kill for the power it has (should have but it doesn't have the power) shouldn't take multiple swings with most of them not registering to get a kill, the shotgun is the same way doesnt register at time either. One more thing fix the god damn hacking tired of meat sponges and people who have perfect aim. Love how sooting someone lethally doesn't ether register or it brings them to either 1 hp or half health or they just eat it like a box of wheaties for breatfast. Fix the hit mark shit in your game its gotten worse over time, dunno what you belly wankers did but now it's garbage. Love the 4k im experiencing in your game also at times."
17781,"a friend told me he loves this game more than csgo, and i'm starting to agree with him. This game gave me the best fun, no pay to win, no grind wall, no opening boxes for useless items and wasting money (the ones presented in the game are only for cosmetic, which you dont really need unless you have a ton of money to invest and play gambling, or you want beautiful guns, its pretty similar to csgo in this aspect...)

Well, i dont have much to say cause many people said most of the good stuffs already... and i can tell you it's all true. All i wanna say is that this is a good game. It's free anyway, you dont lose anything (literally), so just grab it and find out yourself :P

I only had 27 hours in this game, and i got a bunch of guns already, all permanent, so you know it's not grindy at all. Good luck and hope to see more people on the battlefield :)

EDIT: Recently there was a bug with the servers and i was unable to collect my daily reward (which is 500 medal because i hit the 7th day mark), so i submitted a ticket and 2 days later they replied, apologized and sent me double the reward i should have earned (1000 medal). 10/10 best devs ever >.<"
17782, fun game
17783,really awsome. first free fps that i really liked
17784,"Amazing F2P FPS.

Gives me 180-200 frames unlike PUBG which stutters and lags and sometimes hits dont register.

Good skins, good weapons and every hit registers.

Although you might have to grind for the 1 hit weapons, the game gives you 200,000 gold upon start which allows you to buy 2 very nice weapons off the bat. I chose a Scar-L which is wonderful.

Doesn't take long to queue in games.

Does not frustrate me or make me feel like I'm wasting my time with PUBG."
17785,"Ok, let's start with basics.
The gameplay is good, it's weird to not run with Shift key, but well ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Graphics are enjoyable, it's not a likely p2w game, so, cool.


The only trouble that I do find, that I don't know if this can be ""fixed"" somehow, it's that other modes that isn't the quick match, most of the rooms are empty and it's hard to find a match.
But well, if you're there just to do quick matchs and have fun, I'll recommend u this game
7.5/10"
17786,"dont play this game if you dont have hacks, like no recoil, aimbot, etc
dont get me wrong, the actual game is great, and its free to play. but my experience is soured on it because of the cheating, like in combat arms. i cant recommend this game to anyone until the battleeye anti cheat is fixed to actually detect hacks.
"
17787,"Long story short,

I think this might be one of the best free to play shooters at the moment.

only downside might be the running with knives thingy.

+not p2w
+looks good vor 5 GB
+great maps and gameplay

-community
-sometimes feels little laggy

Overall (really short review but hey if it helps) i love to play this and enjoy it very much.

17790,"Really Nice Game, gets you indulged; Best part is the fast gameplay!"
17791,Its just a bad rip off of CS:GO.
17792,"This game is annoying.  Not very well polished, and horrible gunplay.  It felt like it was trying too hard."
17793,awesome then csgo..hehe
17794,this game is a hoot for you and your friends
17795,"For a F2P game it's very good. Kinda reminds me of a game I used to play around 4 years ago called Crossfire. Only I'd say this is better. You must try it out, after all, it is F2P.

9/10 for me."
17796,tac reload simulator
17797,"Honestly, I try not to be too hard and negative on a game for various reasons, but this one was just very sad. The graphics were fine and the gameplay was smooth which is what you want in a first-person shooter. What you also want is realistic damage scaling. You know, the damage scaling everyone's used to by now. I played this game, went into a match, shot a guy not once, not twice, but three times with a sniper rifle. Oh, I also had the first and second shot free before taking fire myself. The guns in this game are way too dumb in terms of actuality. Not to mention that the menu is another one of those shooters with a horrendous amount components and ""in your face"" displays.

I'll come back when they fix their damage scaling."
17798,Good.
17799,"TDM maps designd by people with a solid 5iq maps smaller than my dick(thats really sad) if you like nades its fun just chuck one, die repeat. 1 Competeitive free AR gonna have to give a solid 5/10 execution is meh visuals are nice if only the people who designed the maps didn't either rip off maps from other fps or used their fucking brains. would i reccomend this sure its the only fps that is close to a payed fps :P"

I was gonna come back to this game

17801,good game
17802,This game is soo good
17803,perty fun
17804,highly recommend
17805,i like it. its not to shabby for a free game and it has a competitive atmosphere.
17806,.
17807,"Pros: Realistic, great graphic and smooth game play

Cons: Stuff can really be expensive"
17808,"This game feels like a great balance of CS:GO and BL:R gameplay.  I like it a lot!  Take some time in the tutorial and get some money off of the easy targets to get more weapons.  The game is supported by micro sales but has a case drop system much like CS:GO that you don't need to buy keys to open up.  This is a very interesting game concept and business model!

I grinded out to Seargent quickly to form a clan, only took a day or two of casual gameplay.  Afterward, I started a ""Clan Guide"" for this game to help answer some questions about how clans work in Black Squad.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1350721090

Anyone that has played with me in CS:GO knows I'm all about the knife kills, and I wear my statted weapons with pride.  I wanted to point out that this game tracks your weapons stats by default, you won't need to buy special skins to show off your stats, just look in your inventory and check your stats on a specific weapon. 

This game is a lot of action, without a lot of the toxic trash talk you hear in CS:GO and similar games.  Did I mention it's free to play?  Check it out now!

http://store.steampowered.com/app/550650/Black_Squad/

Don't forget to grab that free DLC off of the store page that gives you your first weapon skin.

http://store.steampowered.com/app/654180/Blacksquad__Welcome_Fortune_Box/

The developers recently started a Spring Break contest for the players to come up with a ""Calling Card"" graphic art design for the game, in which I made a submission that you can find on my profile.  

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1350564986

I love this type of interaction between game developers and their players and I hope they have more events like it.  In addition, I hope that they come up with a Steam Workshop for weapon skins much like CS:GO and other FPS games."
17809,"Best game ever!
Call of duty combined with Counter strike!! My dream game!"
17810,"great game to play with steady fps almost similar to CSGO
good job to neowiz and team for this amazing game"
17811,Nice Game Skrrra pop pop.

17814,"Here's my first 3 hours experience.

Pros
- Free to play
- No pay to win
- Can run on a toaster

Cons
- Awful quickplay matchmaking
- Hipfire is CSGO accurate, there's little to no point to aim down sight in general
- Granade spam is f**ked beyond belief
- Granade cost in-game money and expire in 1 day, like most KR F2P shooter. It's there to encourage you to play more, but still a stupid system."
17815,"the movement and the gunplay is fucking horrible. maps are poorly designed, sound effekts sound cheap. its free i guess, but id just go for BLR for a good f2p shooter"
17816,"i like this game it is amazing however, its servers need to get better as i am experiencing extreme lag even though my internet speed is 100 MB/s"
17817,nice game
17818,"The long story short on this game is that. It's worth messing around with for fun if you're tired of your good ol pubg/csgo/cod/etc, it's a free game, you DO NOT NEED TO PAY ANYTHING AT ALL peroid, there isn't much reason to not try this gme. Within the first hour or two you'll probably own 2/3 guns permanently on top of the guns they automatically give you. You start out with 200k (coins) and you'll be able to buy 1 gun, i'd wait for a second test out the free guns first. 

The unfortunate truth about the game. It's not competitive at all, the game is just not going to be able to become competitive on any real sort of level. There isn't even ranked. (at least for solos theres this clan stuff that's suppose to be there ranked system i think, but it's not...) Map balance is hit of miss some maps straight awful, some pretty good. The AK is too over powered to be a game that you could call balanced. The AK 1 hits head shots, (one of the 2 I think primaries besides sniper rifles that can 1 hit.) So similarly to CSGO AK is the only weapon you want, unlike CSGO you don't have to be on T or buy the weapon, so you always have it at all times. So long story short it's the only viable gun, the recoil on it is insane, but like trust me... But for what it's worth outside of that I don't really have any complaints, maybe that there isnt' specifically any 'fun' guns such as shotties or what ever have you. Well... There is shotguns, but um don't even try them they don't work. (they do work they just rarely 1 hit so why use a super close ranged only weapon, that can't even close to 1 hit most of the time, and it's not like the second or 3rd shot does damage either.)

But honestly the game is fun it is. But it has problems that prevent it from going anywhere in some form of esports nor probably become the top game on twitch. But again it's free just download it when you sleep if you ever had any interest in playing, then play it when you're bored out of your mind it's not gonna take up a lot of space it's only 4gigs you could put it on a flash drive, so it's free cmon man xD."
17819,ineverGiveFuck....hahaaaa
17820,"gun play is garbage. it's as if csgo and combat arms had a crack baby and tried to abort it, but it survived and was adopted by a shitty chinese studio that had no clue what it was doing. why the fuck do i have 15 different sensitivity options including 2 different zoom sensitivities? 0/10 stop trying"
17821,"This game is a fun FTP FPS.  But like all FTP FPS games, there are issues.

This is certainly not entirely pay-to-win.  It does have some guns which cost more than others but they do give you a decent amount of the currency to buy said weapon.  

I wish it would allow you to customize your weapon more for your own instead of just having three.  (Grenade Launcher, Suppressor and Laser)

Matchmaking is not the greatest but not the worst, where I have seen some very bad ones and this one is leaning more towards good.

Another issue is that there is 4 currencies, which is not needed.  You have Gold, Medal, BS Coins and Bullets.

You get gold after every game and in chests, but only get medal for leveling up, and you get BS Coins from buying Bullet Crates.  There really is no need for all 4."
17822,GOLD
17823,gREAT gAME!
17824,I spent a ton of money on bullets to buy crates and i got nothing
17825,"good stuff:
-f2p
-great looking game, even looks better than cod ww2 imo but any half decent game can accomplish that
-gameplay is smooth and responsive
-sounds are good, nice cracking sound when you headshot someone which backs the point above
-no p2w guns like other asian f2p shooters
-start with a massive amount of credits to choose guns

-bad stuff 
-terrible map design (the guys who designed the maps should get an award for how bad they are), the spawn camping is sometimes horrible and you can't break out, 
-snipers are way too good in this game from a mix of horrible maps, how fast people run and how you can move and shoot with no accuracy loss. <- honestly this is my biggest gripe with the game
-spray patterns are hilariously random, theres no way to predict it from how much horizontal recoil there is. 
-grenades are either miss or take most of your life
-netcode is wonky sometimes, you can notice it when you duck up and down walls fast
-unable to veto/pick maps to queue
afterthoughts:
game is actually not that bad, if you've played AVA (rip that game) this game is extremely reminiscent of that with the ability to fly around corners and not get punished for moving and shooting
this game has potential to improve but it suffers the curse of being developed by a korean studio. what I mean is that like every korean made game, they have a good vision of what the game is and most of the time have a good artistic direction but always fall short of maintaing the game to a high standard and end up bleeding players because of bad decisions and lack of communication between (since i'm reviewing this on steam, I'm obviously a western player) the devs and the western community. if they can get over this hurdle and actually talk to the players instead of them [the players] flinging verbal abuse at a verbal punching bag (the community manager/s) then the game will have a future in the western market (inb4"
17826,TAC RELOAD!
17827,"The only good aspect of this game is , that it is free to play.
I would instantly refund if i had to pay.
Cheater , camper or simply the bad spawn system.
You are NOT getting spawned randowmly, the spawns are predeterminatd,
wich makes it very easy to get spawntraped....
Eather you trap or they. 
Gun balance is weak af, and the starter guns are bad of doom.
I playd now 3 hours and i am tired of getting spawntrapped and so on.
Yes i invested money since i think the game could have been good , and thought maby if i spend money i get better guns etc. but i am wrong and i feel scammed tbh."
17828,WE NEED A SKIN MARKET PLACE!!! Other than that a solid free to play
17829,"well this started out as a super fun game but now with all the cheats and server issues  it will go into the pile of gmaes that were good one but never played . hint its no fun when you empty a mag intosomeon and they one shot you or throw a grenade from one side of the map to the other right on top of you, for the exploit where crouching takes lass damage  , but my most favorite is the wall shots or maybe the side gun shots  pick any of those reasons to call this game a FAIL"

Introduction of competitive and a ranking system really added to the game"
17835,Awesome game!
17836,Cool game
17837,This game is intense however a Sydney Server would be great.
17838,"The game just doesnt work pistols are useless, sniper rifle headshots dont exist specifically for you,its pay to win alongside some resistance mechanic when you get kills lots of people live with one hp for no reason plz fix."
17839,"A couple things i would like to address are the money aspect of the game. Right now the game is not pay to win (as that can change in the future but hopefully we dont make that turn) they offer in-game currency to be able to obtain weapons with skins on them (no the skins dont make the stats any better than the normal gun) not to mention the in-game currency isnt extremely expensive and they give you a good amount for what you pay. Now lets move on to the gameplay aspect, the game is perfect for anyone who likes fast paced type games. The game has imaculate hit reg so nothing to complain about in that region of gameplay. The one thing that they could change would be spray patters in my opinion. I have played alot of fps games and the recoil in those games are more easier to control, the recoil in this game seems like its just random at times and if we could get reliable recoil patters for the game that would make this game ten times better. Other than that 10/10 Best F2P shooter on steam. And another thing you can literally run this game on a potato!"
17840,"""Tac reload!"""
17841,i would reccomend this game if i could actually play it. I went into settings and i changed a couple settings like sensitivity and graphics and when i hit apply my screen went black and i tried uninstalling the game and restarting my computer but the screen still goes black i dont know why but it is preventing me from playing the game because the default sensitivity is literally unplayable. Does anyone else have this problem???
17842,Don't play this game.
17843,"Like a free mix of CSGO logic, Call of Duty style and very fast paced. Pretty good for a free game to be honest."
17844,"Cons: Cheaters.  You'll routinely see people making 120m headshots, one shot, all while leaping and running with guns that couldn't hit the side of a barn under those conditions.  You'll find some players doing spectacularly well with sniper rifles in close-quarter combat, etc.  Just YouTube ""black squad cheating"" if you're one of the many who think their anti-cheat software works.  Don't bother complaining, everyone will just say ""get gud.""  Don't bother reporting, they don't care.

Pros: It's not pay-to-win.  After maybe 20-30 hours you'll have enough coins to get all the weapons you care to have."
17845,"Hardest game I've ever played


2019 edit: the game is dead"
17846,tact reload
17847,great multiplayer
17848,"Great mechanics, design, graphics, sound

Awful maps"
17849,fun
17850,"PROS:
-Free to play
-Good gun variety
-Smooth gameplay
-Solid graphics
-Very fun
-Will run on low specs
-Easy Learning Curve
-Friendly Community

CONS:
-Too simple maps
-Only 3-4 gamemodes
-Not enough gear variety(armor, equipement, grenades)

17851,"I've played this  game  for about  an hour. I've played about 2 whole 8v8 matches  and all the time I found other  players  pre firing at every corner and hitting the enemies, I only  killed by headshots. The ranking system is a sh*t  I've played against  people who were not cheating  but having a so  high rank I won't  even  be able to match  them. Beginner  players must learn the game the hardest way they can or just get rage quitted after  a few deaths and delete the game. I don't want either to happen cuz I won't play with a game that has a  sh*tty  rank up match system and I don't want  to rage on something that won't worth my time."
17852,"After 250 hours in this game, streaming, uploading videos, and spending hours aquiring data, this is my honest review of this game:

Pros:
-No pay-to-win.
-Free-To-Play, but doesn't suck. Seriously, this game plays like a mid-tier first person shooter almost on par with CSGO and COD.
-New guns/equipment can be acquired quickly through normal gameplay. No grinding for a week for a new gun, you'll have one in an hour or two.
-Fast Paced: Compared to other AAA competitive shooters, the action is fast and hard.
-Large Variety of Weapons: This game has a gun for everyone! Guns for Sprayers, 1-Tap Gods, No-scopers, whatever playstyle you have, there is a gun/knife for you, and it doesn't take long at all to get!
-Positive Community: Most players you come across are positive, you can easily find people to add and play with.
-Hit Registration: Unlike CSGO, I've never had one instance of a shot I know landed not register.
-Global Support: There are servers being released often, and support for you to play normally with servers around the globe! Definitely give this game a try if you don't live in an area that is usually supported by game developers servers!
-Multiple game modes: There is a game mode for every FPS player! Team DeathMatch for the COD players, Demolition for the CS:GO players, Battle Match for the Battlefield players, BOT TDM for casual players, and Assassination for the awesome players. There is even a PVE mode they have released for Halloween that is a true challenge, and might even stay in the game!
-Holiday Events: They gave skins out just for playing the game during Halloween, introduced a new game mode, and implemented a lot of new items during the holiday update. I hope this trend continues!
-Community: Unlike a lot of other games, this game isn't toxic as hell. Even with random strangers, most of the time you'll have have a good time. The discord is almost always popping with players discussing the game, looking for a clan, or challenging one another. Beware, people still get salty!

Neutral:
-No voice support: You need Discord or another program to communicate via voice.
-Netcode: This works both ways, the greater your lag, the longer it takes for the server to register your shots. If you go up against a lagger, he will have a slight peek advantage on you. If your ping is in the 300+, you will suffer, but there shouldn't be an issue with servers all around the globe.
-Early Access: Now, I'm not going to complain because this game is free, but it's not perfect. I've not run into anything game breaking during my gameplay, but just keep that in mind.
-Hackers: I have 250 Hours in this game, and I've only ran into ONE hacker/cheater during a battle match. In all of my competitive gameplay, I've never observed, or went against any cheaters. People do cheat, but it is rare in this game. Anyone that says they run into hackers all the time most likely aren't used to the game, or don't play on a higher skill level.
-Boxes/Crates: These can be opened by spending Real Money to buy bullets. Bullets is a currency in Black Squad to open boxes, and to also buy exclusive boosters, epic player models, and more. There are a ton of different boxes in Black Squad, so you know exactly what you will get when you open a box. Want a legendary AK-47? You can click the box and know exactly what you might get. Usually they contain an ""epic item"", such as a rare skin, and all the other prizes include gold, medals, BS coins, and sometimes, even lower tier skins. All the boxes, except for one, require you to pay, and everything inside is purely cosmetic. The only box that you can open for free have exclusive knife skins that you can only get by spending gold to open. Some people get lucky, others do not. This is for you to decide.

Cons:
-Uninspired maps: Most of the maps aren't that great in my opinion, they release new ones nearly monthly, but some of them are just...awful.
-User Interface: The main menu sucks. The friendslist/chat gets in the way of anything on the right side of the screen, you cannot chat in the main menu screen at all, and some items you can double-click to quickly navigate, and other buttons you can't! Why? I blame this on early access, but this goes down as a con for me. I enjoy my efficiency!
-Lack of a competitive scene: Yes, this game is early access, but the only way to find ""competitive"" players is to either get lucky on a clan match selection, or find a team on the official discord. There are clan ranks, but no one takes them seriously right now.
-Matchmaking: There have been times where I've went against a team of 5 when I was by myself for 3 rounds before other players connected. This has happened when I've went solo, qued with a team, or just randomly jumped around. The game will TRY to match you up based on rank, but after 30 seconds, it will just throw you with whoever is on. Doesn't really happen in the competitive gamemodes, but if you play assassination, it will happen a lot.
-No report system: Early access, I know, but if someone is being really toxic, or is cheating, the only way you can report right now is by posting a video on the discord. It's better than nothing, and the mods actually do their job!
-Currency: There are 4 different types of currency in this game: Gold, which is gained just by playing the game and given as a daily log-in reward. Gold can be used to buy most guns in the shop, and is easy to obtain a huge amount of it. Medals, which is gained every 7 days as a login reward, and is gained every time you level up. It is used to buy guns/knives/characters from the medal shop. (There are two shops in this game, more on that later) BS Coins, which is only gained by opening boxes. They can be used to buy different skins, compared to just winning them from a box. Finally, Bullets, which is the currency that can only be bought using Real Money. You use these to open boxes, or to buy a special model, or EXP/GOLD booster. I spoke about boxes in my Neutral section of this review above.

If you're broke and want to try something new, give this a try! You get free currency just for doing a quick tutorial, and if you look in the DLC section, you can try almost every gun in the game for free for 15 days! That is more than enough time to amass enough gold and guns to supply your own Black Squad. Give it a shot, and feel free to hit me up at IGN SL4DE. Happy Fragging!

17853,"good game, a mix of cod and csgo, good performance good gameplay good graphics, some minor bugs but its f2p so...."
17854,"its a goood game i like it
"
17855,"Best F2P game, lol sprint around wannabe CSGO"
17856,OMG - MELHOR GAME lol
17857,nO
17858,"Yes, I recommend! If you want a short summary because you don't want to waste ur time, here ya frikin go:
Good graphics, lots of weapons & skins (that u can remember and sound smart with), quick match finding time, awesome gun trials (the dlc's) so you don't waste your in-game money on crap guns, nice community, and good looking maps. So, there ya go. Now try it for yourself!



the only thing the game needs is the other race squads :)"
17859,"If I had to choose just one game to play on Steam! This game is bad, in so many ways..."
17860,VERY INTERSTING GAME
17861,The recoil on some guns are non existant but on others it's uncontrollable
17862,Unable to play. Screen goes black after changing settings and only way to fix that is to shutdown computer or sign out. And ofc the changed settings then arent saved.
17863,"+
Free

-
Simply terrible"
17864,Game is good but i cant play any longer because this game is not supported by nvidia for some odd reason. so for nvidia users you probably wont be able to get that good fps from your nvidia geforce gc.
17865,I just love this GAME .
17866,"Dead game, trash community, lots of Koreans in EU servers, lots of cheaters, pro players getting banned or they leave the game because too many bugs, not even talking about the balance in competitive, or the ""no reg""s that everyone's getting, + like 99.99% of the updates are Skins only."
17867,this is not the csgo review you where looking for
17868,good game
17869,"This is a game that i actualy enjoy!
In a way it is better than CS GO!
WHy is it better?
1-Its free
2-You can buy weapons after a few days of  game play!
3-You can buy Character Skins!
4-There are no ULTRA PRO players!
5-Weapons are balanced.
6-You have m203 grenade launchers!
7-You can put on a silencer and a laser pointer.
8-They are adding NEW stuff to the game!
9-Cool game modes.
10-Everyone can have fun without paying real life money!
11-They make killer deals!
Now the things that i am not fan of!
1-You cant modify your weapon!
2-There aren many weapons!
3-You cant buy a grenade for permanent.
4-Needs more classes.
Overal i LOVE this game!
Do i recomend it?
Hell YEA!
9.8/10"
17870,"great game *-*
"
17871,Went 44/23 in my first game. Wayyyyy too easy.
17872,"Don't get me wrong, The best F2P FPS I've played yet, but:

Pros:
-Free
-good looking low demanding graphics
-Great animations
-Cool concept of adding/taking off silencer on the fly
-laser on the fly (helps team mates more than you)
-decent variety of primary guns to choose from
-Snipers kill in 1 shot to the head
-regular loot boxes with temporary use of guns & characters
-Fairly priced Perm weapons for earned income (first f2P I've seen with that)

Cons:
-no map votes
-lack of variety for secondary weapons
-controls can be clunky (buttons not registering if you push your next action too quickly from your last)
-no flinching when shot
-minimal display telling you you're getting shot
-party invites can be finicky
-snipers & many guns are dead accurate from insane distances in sight or hip fire
-weapons have no sway (horrible against snipers: dead accurate+no sway+ possible lag=bad time)
-Lag can be ridculous (shot through buildings, walls  etc.)
-IDk if it's the lag or hacks but it seems like some players aren't legitimate (no it's not my internet, 500 MB/S Down with  20 ms median ping on a ping test  at the time of posting) but not as bad as Combat Arms

There are many Pros and Cons to this game. It's basically the shiniest best thing at the bottom of the barrel. As a F2P I would say this is definitely the best FPS I've found. , and my review may be too harsh considering the early access state that I didn't take into consideration while writing. However, as a game itself I wouldn't play it out of want, I only play it when my console is busy and/or to play with somebody that doesn't have the same console. Get Battlefield 1 or COD WWII and you'll be much happier. But if that's not possible this game will get you by."
17873,"shitty game do not get trust you start with one less bullet in your fucking clip
WHY MY BRAIN IS HURTING HELP ME like snipers are bad you jsut die and every other gun is the same and you just die peiople throwq smokes stright into your los and they jkust dont care theyre all bad even if you win everygame which i did because i got carried by top 500 ow player (twitch.tv/boostio_ow) its still no fun at all terribad game thums down"
17874,very good reminds me of csgo
17875,It is free and it is really good for a free game. If you think it is bad u can just uninstall the game. When i get bored in csgo i usually go and play this game instead.
17876,Only played this game for 9hrs and my KD is already 2.00 since its easy to play. just like playing my old FPS games like SpecialForce and Counter-Strike. the only thing they need to fix is the RNG for the skins. 200usd for the AK47 legend skin that still i have not gotten. please fix your RNG for crates. its like 0.00001% drop rate. Fvcking retarded.
17877,"game is too easy lol, played 1 tdm and uninstalled. no thanks."
17878,"Bland Call of Duty clone
(It runs good, though.)"
17879,"Yeah.. It's a good game, basically a mix of CSGO, COD and R6S. I often feel like the developer is some kid who loved all three of these games and made them into one, removing the things he/she didn't like. It does appear to be a pay to win at start, but as you play you realize that the guns you can get with ingame currency and the drops are pretty much all you need. The sad part about the game is the playerbase, I play with my 4 other friends, we literally know the other players by their IGN, we go like ""OOHH, XYZ is playing. He's a noob"". I mean, I don't remember the name of my second ccousin but I know who IamAhunter is. So, yeah, it's a good game, that's it.

P.S- The maps are SHIT.. I mean really SHIT.. Who keeps the CT spawn right next to T.. the fak devs!?"
17880,its really good
17881,nice FPS GAME no cheater. for now.
17882,its good
17883,"Very addictive fps team shooter. Another great f2p that isn't p2w. Right now you can get 1200 bullets(for in-game prize boxes) for $0.99, basically 15 boxes for the price of 1 normally. Even if you don't get a gun, you'll get enough medals or coins  to buy one from the in-game shop.

Weapons
For any new players, I recommend the Dragunov sniper(semi-auto with 2x zoom scope) or the MK110K1(also semi-auto, but only 1 zoom option), R5-GL/MDR-GL assault rifle(as 1st medal purchase I recommend the M4 for softer recoil or any AK variant for harder hits and much higher recoil as these 2 guns will most likely become your go-to choices), and M7A1 for smg(SIZMPX is a decent upgrade from the medal shop). I personally don't care for the DMR's(designated marksman rifles), but they serve as a sort of mix of sniper/assault rifle and can be very effective at medium/long range or in close quarters. I use the MK14MOD1 in any rare case where I choose to preset a dmr.
The Desert Eagle is your 1 stop shop for the 1 shot drop(assuming a head shot). The Rhino is a very close 2nd. If you prefer quantity over quality, the Skorpion is where it's at. As a sidearm, I go for stopping power with the Deagle.
Lastly... grenades. This game can feel like a ""grenade rain simulator"" at times. Always at least have the standard frags equipped and use them gratuitously. Smokes can be great for covering your position changes when being sniped at. Flashbangs are great for when you suspect more than 1 enemy in the blast radius.
I've played at least 5-10 games using every gun(with exception of recent additions and melees), so while this is my biased opinion, it is not based on ignorance and limited experience."
17884,"Fun ass game, good as shit try it out. Not p2w and is 100x better then counter strike: global trash trust me. xdd"
17885,ILOVEYOU
17886,Very good game!
17887,FUCKING TRASH GAME NEVER PLAY THIS STUPID GAME THEIR MAP MAKERS ARE THE WORST OF ALL TIME!!!! ONLY CHEATERS ALL GAME THAT SUCK DICK FOR A LIVING AND STILL MANAGES TO WIN BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO USE CHEATS NEVER PLAY THIS FUCKING GAME
17888,"Only recently got a PC that could run games decently without overheating like a mother, I was in the market for a good FPS with decent gameplay. Now I know TF2 is out, but I wanted something a bit more like CoD, which I found with this game.

To say it's a F2P game, it's amazingly good, nothing like I expected, connection seems to be stable for the most part, the modes are all very enjoyable (more so when we figured out we had to shoot the objective, not stand next to them like in CoD (CoD noob)) and the guns are fairly well balanced. I might only have 2 hours on record, but I can normally get a feel on whether or not I'll enjoy a game within 40 minutes. Glad to say I most certainly feel that way about this.

Give it a go, you might as well since it's free, and honestly, it's a better FPS game than the recent full price ones."
17889,I would highly recommend this game to other players who like first person shooters. The game has various modes for any type of player ranging from TDM to Assassin where you kill or protect a VIP.
17890,Very nice 10+ best multi players games FPS
17891,pretty good job so far
17892,"pros: 1. can attach laser sight  silencer for free of everyguns
         2. no rent system with guns and you can buy gun of your choice at the first time
         3. fast reborn in team deathmatch   

pro or con : blood and violent 

cons: 1. it is very very fast to die than another FPS games  very real    it is not how good of your guns, it is Texus gunfire ,and die in one or three shot
         2.  grenade is not free to use   but i think it is not important much
         3.  have not much armor 
         4.  weapons that sell in the shop have it item fixed  so you can't change your red dot sight or holo sight    each guns have it scope and laser sight      easy to understand     can't modify you weapons
         5.  don't have an player bot VS player bot    like  A.V.A   

conclusion
i think it is good with someone who love to play this style   fast kill fast reborn more kill more fun  if not  you will hate this game"
17893,how to have logo? :v
17894,this game is like cs go i recommend this game to peapol or newbis who dont know about the cs go game.this game is fun to play whit friends sou download this cool game.
17895,good~!!
17896,it's the best game and it take all my time <3
17897,really awesome game
17898,Very good game easy controls great game
17899,6/10
17900,A mix between CS GO and AVA If you are a competive shooter enthusiast please try this.
17901,I am very dissapointed in myself that i ever had this game on my pc...
17902,The game is very awsome
17903,"open ten crates for a gun that has 3 varients of it 1200 (=10$) bullets gone at 80 per open, guess what no gun........."
17904,sucks...please say no ...
17905,Is a VeryGood Free game Potato Spec is can play on Hard Graphic on this game 40+FPS Wow
17906,"The game is good , but however i spend some money on random box there but mostly i get gold , soo this is the only issue , they should remove gold at least from the boxs"
17907,"how i can give money from account to account
?"
17908,"Great game, alot of people say its like call of duty and CS:GO, but i feel its more like COD & R6S. As i mentioned it is a great game, but unfortunately there are no oceania servers. So if you live in Australia/New Zealand you are basically forced to play on East Asia or South East Asia servers. I really do hope that they get servers here as it would make the game much more enjoyable. If you live in EU/NA there are servers.

Either way, its a refreshment none the less. Maps are somewhat small but thats what makes it fun!

:)"
17909,Black Squad is a very fun FPS game. It's a simple as that when I have nothing else to play I boot this game up and play a few matches for fun. Worth looking into as a fun F2P game.
17910,"meh, feela like a money grab"
17911,"Best f2p modern shooter
+ Amazing recoil
+ Good store system
+ Blood
+ Perfect mix between arcade and serious business
+ Movement feels great, physics can improve yet.

PLEASE ADD the Q & E movement for aim like rainbowsix or pubg

- Could have more weapons, offers no customization like we want it
- Attachments should cost something (not millions, cmon)
- I just killed 3 with headshot, pulled the glock, finished more two and killed a guy with a knife. Can't I have a quakesound idk?
- Skins costs millions"
17912,"This game is like COD: Black ops 2 and Counter-Strike had a baby and i love it. 

Free to play is cool, but i think this game would get more popularity and recognition if it were a cheap early access title like what PUBG did. With a gun system like CS and BO2. With micro transactions for skins and maybe some gun variants. 

But aside from that it feels pretty solid, the free weapons feel pretty good, not sure if paying players have an advantage or not. 

Headshots are satisfing to say the very least."
17913,poorly made game with everything costing way too much real money.
17914,"Its CSGO but on a different level. No toxicity, better graphics, more accurate gameplay (hitboxes etc.), just as fun, and its FREE!!!

10/10 would play again ^_^"
17915,Decent free to play FPS gets boring around 20 hours though cause there isnt much content but if they updated it a bit it would be really good for sure.
17916,Kinda sucks but also kinda fun somehow?
17917,Good Shooter its call of duty with less lag but a bit worst graphics but all in all its a pretty good game :D
17918,There is a huge glitch or bug where i can buy my permenent guns as many times as a want i accidentally bought an already permanent gun i had and i farmed gold and i lost 92.000 gold black squad put a report bug option cause i want my gold back this is very unfair please give my gold back i spent hours farming that.
17919,the game has improved yet like other games it could do with the bot fights being more intense because people are walking all over the bots
17920,Love it
17921,"this game is good for being free
"
17922,Nice
17923,baaler hacking game! now this game is becoing coooool !! please update it more like that some co operation playing system and some story mode!!!!!!!!!
17924,"this game doesnt know da wae im out
"
17925,"Three things i mind atm:

 - there's this sniper with 100 accuracy and it's just too damn accurate! If you almost graze someone's face as you shoot at them, there's no damage done. There's this guy i tried to kill and 3 times i shot at his contour, and none of them deviated even a little bit. It's not reasonable, i know, but it's frustrating to miss someone by milimetres...

- face-off issue: if you and another player shoot each other and hit at virtually the same time, only one dies and the other takes no damage. You can't believe how many times i shot someone, saw the blood splatter come out of them, heard the bullet hitting flesh sound and then died, leaving the other guy completely unharmed.

- Battle Match mode is completely done if one team manages a simple exploit: Bomb the shit out of the enemy respawn base constantly, repeatedly, endlessly. That's it, just bomb them in rotation and there's nothing anyone can do about it. Game over, game won, game is done.

Otherwise, it's a good time waster."
17926,"Cool Fps game! The small sized maps make the game very fast pace and is very suitable as a casual FPS experience.
This game is a 4 out of 5 for an early access ! 
Its a MASTAPIEECE!!"
17927,Best game ever!! Try it. +)
17928,i like this game....i watch it on youtube
17929,"The game was nice, the only questionable part is the shotgun killing in a long range"
17930,"Overall a good game, but soon devolves into a camping snipefest orgy. Fun if you want something for free, but don't take it too seriously. For a F2P it is quite good, but there are some very glaring faults that are not getting fixed."
17931,"Just Awesome Loved More Than CSGO! Too! xD 
IGN - Suberb_Gamer
IGN (2)- (-iSuperbGamer)"
17932,Great fps game.
17933,camping simulator. just without tents or campfires
17934,stupid cs ripoff
17935,very good game.....
17936,"Concept is very good but is very unrealistic and has a very confusing UI for new players, number of hackers is very high mainly on SEA servers, Battle-Eye needs to be improved."
17937,"Good Game! Not P2W at all. You only need money if you want skins. Weapons work nicely and feel balanced.

Hope there will be a competitive solo-queue soon."
17938,Pay 2 win and no proper community :(
17939,"Nice game, but the ping is not quite good enough."
17940,"So if you like pay to win FTP games this is for you.

Little boys like to use the 1 shot snipers that they bought with their mom's credit card to camp the nastiest corners ever.  The maps are literally smaller than my will to live that I got from playing this game.  Not to mention the movement is straight donkey cheeks and sprint is bound to scroll wheel.

Enough said I rate this game 11/10
Definitely would play again :)"
17941,ba_best :D :D
17942,"No Aus Servers.

movements are clunky feeling and spray patterns for guns feel very static and the default pistol is so accurate it feels so odd and bad."
17943,A truly terrible time. Don't even try
17944,10/10
17945,"Worse than CrossFire, and never shut down itself."
17946,"probably the most garbage shooter of all time, pay to play, u get killed every time by the people who pay becuase of op guns despite putting bullets on them first they can somehow run threw them, turn 180 degrees and kill you, whoever made this should be ashamed"
17947,"Played this game for several months, would recommend seeing as all guns can be obtained through playing, there is no Pay to win aspect"
17948,worst ui ive ever seen on a video game
17949,"Cool game but not cool like CSGO
"
17950,best free to play fps on steam hands down
17951,KILL THIS STUPID GAME    ty
17952,I like this! You have a lot of guns! This is the new sf 2 and it's a combination between CS:GO and SF2! I recommend this game with great pleasure!
17953,More like COD then CSGO. Very fast paced action that is not very realistic with recoil. It is pretty fun and is likely the only good Free to play AND Free to win FPS on steam.
17954,"i played this game for so long when the publisher is still gemscool coz im from indonesia, then it comes to steam. so glad that finally i can play this game again, just make this game absolutely secure from cheaters and i think its gonna be a good good game and can contest any other fps game. and add some feature like vote kick, add some guns that can be bought by bullet coz i dont see bs coin is usefull if its so hard to obtain, and add some special guns which presented in previous BS version ^_^
Hope this game get big succes !!"
17955,"Love this game. Have only played about 2 hours of it, and i love it. The feel is great, reminds me a lot of the game Black, from the PS2 and original Xbox era. I will continue playing this game unless it breaks, and will recommend to friends
"
17956,"Garbage admins, all money hungry

-Pros
*Gameplay is actually fun
*Some decent skins ingame

-Cons
*Hardly any players, constantly see the same names
*Spent over $300 and got 1 gun, still don't have the 20k BS coins needed for 1 gun, leaving the few decent skins unreachable
*Constant lag
*Banned from the Discord for asking for help
*Matchmaking is terrible, Considers parties as 1 person, easily start a fresh match 5v1 (Max party is 4)

-Random boxes
This is what you spend real money on. This is where you get the few good skins in the game (And I mean a few). You spend however much money and each box costs $1. The chances are shit and the weapons obtained are purely cosmetic. Spent well over $300, $270 of it all at one time. Opened approximately 280 boxes (There was a one time ""promotion"") and got 1 gun on about the 260th box. (That's $260)

The boxes are a scam and the devs reaction is a joke. When confronted about the outrageous chances (In a dead game I remind you) They said ""Sorry, maybe you should try again"" as if $270 wasn't enough the first time

Not a recommended game, if you're paying for strictly cosmetics it should never cost $300+ for a gun, everyone says the devs and staff is useless, listen to them."
17957,Love it. 1 on 1 knife is the most fun
17958,better than csgo and any COD
17959,Boring
17960,Too Dark
17961,its fun i guess
17962,werqereqrqer
17963,"someone help me pls, how to change region?"
17964,Definitely a great F2P shooter with some awesome gun mechanics and constant entertainment.
17965,"Nothing special, Just a genaric F2P FPS."
17966,"this game make me crazy . jajaja
i love it . addict to play .. thanks"
17967,"Haven't played CSGO, but this is a very good game. I wish there was more weapon selection and that you could mod your weapons, but I still enjoy the game quite a bit."
17968,"It suck so much 
"
17969,A fun fast paced shooter thats not even pay-2-win.  Good variety of guns (maybe too much assualt rifles) and for me there is a lot of replayability for me at least. Though there are good things the bad ones are that the skins are really hard to get its either save up bs coins(premuim currency) or hope you get one from a lootbox. I do wish the updates would come out a bit quicker. Overall a really fun game that lets people with money or no money to have a great time.
17970,its a really fun game one of my favs defentley recommend this game for new comers to steam its a fun and well not to easy game but its stil a very good game #dragingballz
17971,GOOD GAME!!!
17972,hi
17973,VERY GOOD MY FRIEND
17974,i like this game very much is a  game with a lot of potential and yea... i recomend it . btw cool skins lol
17975,Nice game! For me it's a mix of Counter Strike and Battlefield. I played a lot of games Free to play and Black Squad is one of the best :D
17976,good game
17977,One of the best first person shooters I've ever played. The level of detail the developers put into the game environments and weapons is amazing. Customize your playstyle everything from a light SMG loadout to snipers and light machine guns! Black Squad is truly a one of a kind experience!
17978,the best :)
17979,"It's hilarious. Movement is very stiff - you can't really run. Running is your ""normal"" movement. Then you have the option to crouch or ""walk"" without sound. Reminds me of back in the day - no problem - but you have to hold the effen key to crouch or ""walk"". 

Maps are generic and spawn killing isn't an option. So there is no point in rushing - everybody just camps and picks off the noobs who rush. 

Stupid virtual cash system to buy guns.

A bunch of wallhackers 

No killcams

I have to say the shooting by itself is decent though. Very accurate. 

That's about it.

No Thanks."
17980,"To be honest the layout for the game, is hard i still havn't figured out how to select anything other than TDM ; 
but the game play is awesome as hell. i do feel someplayers are hacked or something but ive seen the admins removing them anyway i really love this game and i do highly recommend  it"
17981,Worse than Crossfire.
17982,"As much as I despise in game transactions, this game did the whole F2P CoD aspect better than Blacklight: Retribution after the developers made it worse. This game uses BattlEye so even though there are some cheaters the game does a pretty good job of catching them and kicking them. As for gameplay it's pretty spot on. I mainly play a ton of TDM but it does the Demolition mode quite well. I'd give it an 8/10 on the good game scale."
17983,"For a free game, you can't really argue on it too much. Quick game play and a lot of detail put into it. I really enjoy it a lot."
17984,Game is nice..but DO NOTTT bother wasting money those random boxes..Dont even think about spending money those crap random boxes you get nothing so if you wanna support devs then buy DLC weapons.
17985,"The Gameplay is real good,hardly no pay2win but i have one major fucking problem..The drop rate on skins are worst i've ever seen in a game i spent over 40 bucks in one day..my bad in 10 mins and got nothing but the lowest currency in the game every single last one!!!!.Play the game don't invest a dime in this game"
17986,"pros 
f2p no pay to win 
easy to lern hard to master
low pc req
free gun DLC
cons
i am shit 
"
17987,"

DEAD game with stupid devs never learn how to listen to players, MERGE SERVER ??? lol this game has been decent until those bullsh*t updates come up, good job and good bye! 

(already played over 500h and i'm fu*king regret now i need to try to sell all trash items remain from my inven before this game is over dead)"
17988,Can't play now?
17989,NIce Game Like CS GO
17990,"Overall, It's a pretty cool game, I've just started playing it a few days and i'm already hooked..
I play it any chance i get. For being early access, There is a lot of different game modes and maps to play. If you haven't tried it yet, Have at it and give the game a try.. You never know, You might just like it. I give the game a 10\10 rating"
17991,"i love this game its really fun

"
17992,"Pretty awesome free to play shooter if you like (really) close quarter engages and mostly hip firing, but the overall the maps are too small and the spawn points are a problem to make it fun for a longer period for me.

(+) Free to play and the proggresion system is pretty fast compared to most other free to play games
(+) Good servers, no lag at all
(+) Great graphics that my (decent) laptop can handle with no problem
(+) You get a great primary gun and sidearm from the start and additional guns are pretty easy to obtain
(+) All guns feel viable

(-) Most of the maps feel way too small, only having 2 or 3 'corridors'
(-) Spawn points are too close to eachother, two steps and you're already in the enemy spawn
(-) Sentry Turrets are shit to play against and it's not instantly visible if it's friendly or not
(-) Most classes feel kinda 'meh'
(-) 'Destroy' is a shitty game mode, where you need to defend your containers but half of them are closer to the enemy spawn than your own"
17993,"There is no skill required to be good at this game

There is no recoil in this game, no running inaccuracy, and no jumping inaccuracy

And the sound in this game is absolutely terrible, a headshot sounds almost exactly like the kill sound and is overly loud, and the directional sound is terrible. You would be better playing with no ingame sound and playing some music

The grenades in this game can be thrown way too far and they do 50+ damage when you arent even close to them and it does 100 damage if they go off right at your feet 

And the maps in this game are horrendous, they give the team that gets lucky and spawns at one half of the map a major advantage to the other team and you can almost throw a grenade from your spawn to the enemy spawn on some maps

And the gun balancing is the dumbest thing ever where some guns including the starting rifle takes 20 bullets to kill one guy without a headshot and 10 bullets to kill someone with a headshot while some bullets take 5 bullets to kill someone without a headshot and the sniper rifles can be shot like a pistol which makes it almost impossible to kill someone with a sniper rifle at long range with a weapon that isnt a sniper rifle

The only good thing about this game is that its free
"
17994,"As for ftp and no pay to win there, not bad at all. I see a lot of people with high ranks i mean they played this game damn long but they're not good players, more like casual. and they still enjoy playing this game for such a long time. Definitely recommend this game, as for tryharders as for people who like to have fun to play with friends."
17995,Nice
17996,"One of the best Free to play FPS Games i've ever played ! Its just awesome ! Gameplay and Weapon physics COULD improve a little bit, but its not that bad ! I loved it <3 

I'll rate this 9/10 !"
17997,"This game is very good just give it a try

Its Free

Its good

Nice graphics

JUST DO IT,Install it and play! :D"
17998,"Not Pay2Win, Amazing netcoding, good pacing with getting new gear, great animations and graphics, and Tactical Reloads cant ask for much more."
17999,"good game
"
18000,Great game so addictev
18001,Fun so sun to play!!
18002,Its sad really. I really like the game. Spent quite a bit of money on it too. Basically? Don't play this game if you want anything more than a casual experience. The patches dont seem to fix much. Still the occassional hackers and all they keep releasing are skins...
18003,"So instead of grinding for a gun you want, you grind for 100k just to gamble it away for a shotgun or a duplicate which you can sell for around 800 or less xD epic.
You can't play competitive with friends because its unbalanced to have friends. Just play clan wars where you get a clan lvl i guess xD .
Don't get me wrong i loved black squad but these updates are killing it, btw the game is dying it has like 1-2k players daily instead of 5-6k when i played it, so try it whale you can. :D"
18004,Quite fun to play
18005,I only have this because I thought there would be a gang of black people to pin me down and
18006,it's pretty good :)
18007,"Pretty neat online FPS, 
You can feel the game mechanics is similar to UT/CS and so is the game-play

Best guns available for free if you spent a little time in any official MM game

5/5 FOR ME 👍"
18008,shit game just uninstall and buy CSGO
18009,"This game has a potencial. I have been playing this game for about 4 hours and i can say it like a better csgo. Or..simpler R6 Siege. I ll appreciate if the devs take care about this game. For example. adding Q, E strafes would be really nice."
18010,"This game is Best . the game has high texture quality when it just need a low pc , the game size is fun 5gb its not even compareable with other fps games , i hope this publisher keep the way like this , 
sorry for my english btw , but this is good at all"
18011,"This games will make you get OCD because there is always missing 1 bullet in magazine when you spawn.

Edit: There's 1 bullet in the chamber already. Still, it gives me OCD."
18012,"8/8 - IGN. Would IGN again.

It also sounds like a black gangbang gay porno.

Please don't ban me Steam!"
18013,"I absoulutely love this game, this is an example of a free 2 play game. I would pay for it full price, there is no pay to win aspect at all!"
18014,nice but casual
18015,Nice Game bb
18016,its a nice fantastic game
18017,"Pretty good free to play shooter.  The gun sounds aren't very good and there's practically no recoil, but it's still a pretty fun game."
18018,nice game :3
18019,Game needs full controller support
18020,"Quite simply the best Free to Play Competitive FPS out there. Also has so much potential to be the standard for competitive FPS gaming. 

Feels less arcade-y than CS:GO to me. The in game physics, the sound, character animation, the game just gives off a minor sense of realism that other shooters lack. Kind of like if CS:GO and COD:MW had a baby and that baby grew up and had a baby with Battlefield 3 then Black Squad would be that very baby.
Gameplay mechanics for every mode is very simple and easy to grasp. 
Overall graphics look beautiful and model/object details look absolutely stunning. The weapons, the characters, the optional  and very desireable weapons and player skins they all look amazing and very polished. Definitely something to go after whatever the cost. 
Maps though scarce are very well designed and devs are adding more every time so nothing to complain about that one.
Very competitive as in you would want to get better and not just play for fun. Though playing for laughs works sometimes too.  No pay to win aspect so everyone is on the level playing field. Just pure skills and instinct(except for the occassional hackers).
Havent joined/tried the Clan aspect of the game but I hear its a hit and miss kind of thing. Works for some, not quite the same for the others.
Seasonal updates and specials guarantee optimized gameplay, fresh contents and tons of replay potential. 

Wish they put more emphasis on the 'Squad' aspect of the game. An in game voice chat would be nice. Also wish there was a better reward system too(random non-permanent special items/skins for every rank up perhaps?)

I got lots of games in my PC but I keep coming back to play Black Squad everytime. I even saved up to buy weapon and player skins cause they just look thaaat good. Guess theyre doing something right with this game. 

Keep up the good work Devs!! We'll be playing as long as you keep the fire going!"
18021,"I think it's fine game for short period of time.
Probably, like many f2p games, it won't be ""profitable"" to play for longer time... [that's why negative review usually have longer times].
"
18022,A good fps  one or two hackers here and there but still a fun experiance
18023,not badits preety good!!
18024,"Love this game play it every night with buddys, we love killing each other, So this is the best free first person shooting game."
18025,"Better than CSGO in game money in game life how cool huh :D
"
18026,"good game , good game just that its kinda anoying how there aren't like matches where you battle whit people that are the same rank as you 


#fuckmynoobass"
18027,"Its insanely fun, way better than CSGO, but sadly doesnt have a big enough competitive community"
18028,looks like the next cs go but better good vibes really dig this game. now i can quit playing cs go forever haha :P
18029,"total garbage game
young kids and hackers/cheaters are the only ones that will like this trash.
spent a bit of time on this ...even stuck some money into it...FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T PUT MONEY INTO THIS GAME !!!....each time i put money into this game it has gotten worse to play,almost like you get penalized for investing into it.
bullets won't get you anything anyway and stay away from the chance boxes they are a waste,payout is set higher than a local bar poker machine.
i keep coming back in hopes that it will get better but it just doesn't....they slowed some hacks and cheats but there is still better than half of them playing that are using return fire aimbots,walls...etc... that just don't get picked up.
guns are crap...dynamics are way off and damage,stability is very biased ...the weapons stats don't mean anything.
so if your looking for a tactical game keep looking...if you like running around like a fool spraying ammo or can only play games with a cheat because you have to pretend to be something your not then this is the game for you.
complete waste of time for anyone into real competition or realistic game play.
"
18030,Pretty solid fps. the only bad thing in my eyes is that sensitivity doesnt go up high enough for my taste but i can deal with that
18031,Csogo/Cod copy.
18032,"One of the best Free2Play FPS in history of gaming

Its alot of fun playing with friends & clan mates!
In Black Squad we have many positives like :
- No Pay 2 Win
- Enough weapons to choose
- A nice ranking system
- Never get bored of this game
- Cool skins and knives with animation (for RL money)

And some negatives :
- Nade launcher
- Bad spectator mode

It's a cool game at all and worth trying ! :)

"
18033,It kicks you for high ping while having inadequate support for regions outside of those where the game's servers are located
18034,I can't play because it won't let me in
18035,"A game that has team dead match, bomb match, and many more game modes, guns n still manage to have a decent graphics and literally no bugs...better servers that seige and its around 5gb in size. What can i say? Best free game i have ever played"
18036,Banning people for random prefires since 2018.
18037,its a nice game but i wish there were more maps especially for the capture mode
18038,"Honestly the worst fucking game i've ever played, DON'T DOWNLOAD IT"
18039,"Having played lots of F2P shooters over the past 9 years I had hopes that this game would become a quality replacement of good old A.V.A. Oh boy was I wrong ... 
The korean devs are once again showing how ""competent"" they are at making quality products. 

Let me begin with pros:

-somewhat decent graphics for a free-to-play game, well, kinda.

-surprisingly big player base (at some point there were 12 000 players online, which is good imo).

Now the bad things:

-maps are bad, i mean BAD. I doubt they even were tested before being added to the game.  They are huge and complicated, the chokepoints are (usually) located in very awkward areas. The layout is very confusing too, making it hard to navigate for newer players.

-UI is terrible, after 150 hours of playing I still can't get used to it. Players were complaining about it half a year ago, after the 1st CBT session, not a single word regarding that matter from the devs.

-everything you recieve in game is stored in your mailbox, and letters can only last for 30 DAYS. 30 DAYS MAN! It's 2018, come on! And if you don't claim it within 30 days it DISAPPEARS. VERY GOOD SYSTEM.

-since CBT, players were asking for a ping limit. Well, they added it. 200 ms limit. Only for EU server. Later they (for some unknown reason) upped it to 220 ms, and now its 250 and not working properly (I keep on getting 300 ms+ players in my matches every now and then, and for some reason they are not being kicked at all).

-shooting mechanics in this game is TERRIBLE. All guns have RANDOM recoil, which means you can't learn how to shoot with certain weapons ... OH WAIT. Actually, 1 gun has a spray pattern! It's our favorite Type 95! But the pattern itself can hardly be learned because it literally changes direction 7 or 8 times and has rate of fire of an automatic sniper rifle. All the guns besides MK14, AK-47 (AK-12), SR-47 have absolutely no recoil and can be sprayed while running full speed. Btw you can spray mid air too without losing any accuracy. Well, at least it's realistic, this is a military simulator after all ... .

-grenades are almost useless in this game. Smokes are only 8 seconds long (with round length of 2 min 30 sec), and since hitmarker is flashing every time you hit someone, you can easily tell if anyone is behind the smoke. Flashes are impossible to dodge but are thrown right in front of yourself. Very useful. HE nades deal RANDOM damage and can kill you through different surfaces (even if you are behind a wall). All nades are made of wood, they don't bounce off surfaces at all.

-this game has no tagging system. Well, there used to be tagging, but they removed it because it was not working properly. Basically with no tagging (being slowed down while recieving damage) you can run full speed and punish noobs trying to one-tap you with an AK! Makes the game super competitive.

-Unreal Engine 3. THREE. It's been some time since UE4 released, why not use it instead? No. Now that the game is using UE3 you get random freezes while shooting, unstable fps (unless you have a bitcoin mining farm with 5 titans), some players can't even play because of misterious voodoo crap like black screen during gameplay and so on. 10/10.

-crouchspamming. Remember how OP bunnyhopping was in CSS before zblock addition? Its basically the same thing. You can bind crouch to your mousewheel and spam it every time you see an enemy. Somehow we still have players defending this bs. Another gamebreaking exploit that hasn't been fixed since CBT. And some players claim, that the developer is not going to ever remove it as it is a ""feature that makes the game special"".

-poor translation and voicing. Apparently done via google translate, some sentences are just plain wrong. I'm speaking for the english version, but from what I've heard from my friends using the russian version, it's not any better.

-the devs are focused on PROFIT. This game is broken, but not because of P2W. You can buy everything for in-game currency (gold or medals), only skins are available for real money and some boosters. However, considering this game is on EA stage, the amount of skins (shitty ones, safari mesh level) in the game already is utterly ridiculous. Instead of doing the right thing and making changes based on EXPERIENCED PLAYERS FEEDBACK, they are adding meaningless features and skins / characters / maps. 

-battleye anti-cheat. Even though I've only seen 1 or 2 hackers in over 150 hours, I have to admit that BE is not a good anti-cheat for a free-to-play game.

So is this game worth your time? No, not now at least.

UPD 1: 24.01.18 maintenance has doubled my ping (for absolutely no reason), now I'm having 150+ instead of 60-70. Also a group of macro users was unbanned because they asked devs to do so. What a shitshow."

18044,"i spent 60 usd in game for a free 2 play game...is it worth it? absolutely yes it is. i dont know about some complaining. to be honest, they may right, but not all... pings was high because of servers was lacking....report hadnot been add because it still was early access, they didnt finish to release it so it was a barebone game for you to play. yes, hacking happen these days but devs did try to banned all those worms for you to have an absolutely good time after a hard day....met new guys, make new friend and enjoy the game was a key to hooked me. i am in love with it, i did drop csgo since this game released it early access. yes, it was not an esport like csgo but it totally was a game for play. what i did with 60 usd? only for 3 chars skin, yes, for only females chars skin. orther left over i open box. and got nothing, quite sad but hey, i could buy skins with bs and one of 3 chars was paid by bs. do i feel waste? not a single time? why? because from the beginning i only want to dominate something for devs...for them keeping good free 2 play game for other people so we can meet new face and ""bully""them right? - nah, dont do that with newbies because i am the one who will bully them XD - and i love to see some female in fps, it never was reallistic but it really catch my eyes...yeah, i was F.a so what wrong?...and once they update 1 good looking chick, i guess i will lose 20 usd then...last, try it to see will you love it, or you will miss all good time. by the way, your first guns was best guns, so dont judge other or their guns. well, A Fear name TAR...enjoy your game. if you have complain, feel free to tell devs because they will try their best to fix and avoid it."
18045,good new free game 8/10
18046,Pretty good game with good graphics and gameplay. It's kind of free CSGO version. I believe if they keep on improving the game may be it can beat CS GO someday. Good job by the devs.
18047,"Must give it a try, you can say it is a mixture of call of duty and csgo"
18048,Spray & pray. absolute garbage game. dont waste your time.
18049,"How did this garbage got so many postive reviews?! It's just awful, every aspect of it. Map design, weapon feel is non existent. Flooded with cheaters and uttery boring. One of the worst F2P gaems I've ever tried."

18054,"this game is dead, no one on the north american servers. not a single match, had to wait longerthan when i had walmart internet back  when modern warfare 2 was on xbox 360"
18055,"Better than CS:GO and CoD;

Quick matchmaking;

Small and simple maps: you don't have to roam for minutes in order to find people to shoot;

Great shooting mechanics: just aim and shoot, couple of bullets can kill, no ""bullet sponge"" bs;

Game isn't Pay to Win;

No hats with pink bubbles or cute pony heads circling around;

Haven't yet seen a single hacker;

People rarely type in chat and if they do it's mostly strat related (Not sure, but i think there is no voice chat, which is great);

No respawn timer, you respawn instantly (At least in TDM game mode)."

18057,good game

1.Works very well on a potato laptop
2.Free (for this game it should be 5$ :D )
3.Nice events
4.There is no voice-chat

[h1] Cons [/h1]

1.[b] Very toxic players [/b]
2.No in-game report
3.You can't change your name
4.Skin drop rates are like 1%"
18061,Absolutely amazing game for none serious quick fix shooter. However I have stopped playing it because the cheaters have taken over... which ruines the fun. You literally die as you spawn or are already being shot at before you go around a corner.
18062,"Black Squad is a great Free-to-play FPS game, and love it everything about it. No p2w with anything at all which is great. This is what I usually look for whether the game is focused on cash grab overpowered stuff. Very pleased that there is none (currently. Not sure if there will ever be any in the future [hopefully not]). Graphics are amazing in this game even on Low settings (not really much a difference from High and Low). 

There are a few downsides to this game that I currently see. Ping is an issue as higher ping have better advantage over lower ping. Party system, lobby system, matchmaking system, and others similar are very clunky. I once had to wait around 3-4 minutes just to play a game.

The game still has potential to be better, such as more maps, weapons, better lobby system, and more. I will look forward for every patch that they release to see what they will do.

Other than that, it's a great free-to-play game, and I highly recommend to those who are looking for casual play."
18063,"It's a fun game but i would like to point out a few things they should fix:

1. Grenade spam
2. Gun recoil
3. Server connection"
18064,dead game/bad game
18065,"Good servers, rarely ever lags. Balanced, guns are easy to get. The game is very generous with it's rewards so there's no real reason to pay money unless you want to use purely cosmetic shit. (if you used real money to get guns you're a fucking impatient dumbass) 

Feels like a mix between Counter Strike and Call Of Duty but without the whiny voicechat kids or the stuttering crappy ass servers that crash every 20 seconds.


Very easy to master specially if you're good at CS. You'll be shitting down the necks of high-leveled players in no time. I get MVP being low leveled playing against master ranked retards"
18066,"This game is very fun, it is almost hard to believe a first - person shooter like this is free. There is multiplayer, campaign just like popular titles. For example, Call of duty, Battlefield and other famous first person shooters. I recommend this to anyone who likes to play games like CoD (Call of duty) and Battlefield."
18067,Great game
18068,"This Game is Terrible 
-Have 100 Health
-Hit Someone And they have 1 hp
-Get Instantly No Scoped and Killed.


Shit game"
18069,"So, I've played Black Squad for a while, now.

Basically, it's a nice game with the standard and classic F2P-Shooter features, nothing special, yet.

The game-mechanics are working quite well for an ""Early Access"" product and the servers seems to be stable. Netcode is OK, not perfect, but not as bad as in other games from the same type. The weapons seems to be quite balanced, allthough I can't say very much about the Cash-weapons. 

One really negative point: The community. It sucks! Seems to consist of little kids and flamers. Haven't tested clans and clanmatches, so far, but I don't think that the community is much better there. Also, I do not think that Black Squad will have good chances for joining the eSports scene, but we'll see. Now, it's up to the developers to fix the bugs, appearing in the ""Early Access"" - phase and to work on the community, Anti-Cheat-System, etc. Good luck, I'll keep playing."
18070,The maps are so small that you can spawn camp enemies from your own spawn point. 10/10
18071,trash game
18072,"The game itself is created almost as perfect. The only thing here that stop this game to be one of the greatest games out there are the prevention of getting the game exploited. 

The battle eye which currently in use to prevent exploitation in the game is weak, thus resulting the game to slowly destroyed by greedy players who only knows how to play an unbalanced game.

I hope the devs or anyone who is in high position in this game can address this issue because this a very BIG NEGATIVE impact if you won't do anything about it or just consider it because it is just a f2p game."

18090,great game
18091,"Do you like games that cause you frustration? Do you like having bad hit registry? Do you like having a population full of a high amount of high ping players in NA servers? If your answer was yes then try it today!

Update JAN 9, 2021 - Ping limiters which were advertised years ago restricting 200+ ping players in NA servers were never implemented as previously promised by developers. Public matches will consist of on average 100+ ping player lobbies. Hit registry was never fixed either as several headshot sound effects (crunch sounds) are heard confirming a headshot, yet the server registers your death instead of the opposing player due to high ping/ server tick rates. If Black Squad 2 ever happens, let's hope developers listen to competent and mature players feedback more so than the whiny people that only ask for game re-balances and for once are able to fulfill on their promises to their players. Don't make promises you can't keep."
18092,"This game is trash and needs alot of help. Not only do you die behind walls and play the same map three games in a row, the shotgun will have you ready to jump off. One pump from up close should kill your opponent not 30 percent them sometimes and kill them the other. Get a grip. If you love close range spray fights and no skill shots this is the game for you."

18118,"This game is fun to play.
"
18119,"At first the previews were good, mostly positive. Then when you play the game a bit, you realize one thing. It's full of people camping, and people using aim bots, and hacks to win. One game I played, the enemie used pistols and always get headshots so I got tired of it easily."
18120,"This game is fun and has potential honestly, with:

1. Fun gunplay that's easy to learn, hard to master.
2. Cosmetic gun/melee microtransactions which are cheap/sexy looking and no advantage against players.
3. Feels and operates like CS:GO, yet in a more Battlefield or COD pace.

However..I'd REALLY love to invest more time..but..the CONS are huge and TERRIBLE.

1. Matchmaking is horrible...EXTREMELY.
2. Unfair ping advantages and slow performace with servers.
3. Quick match finding is a hit or miss, sometimes you'll get in a game in 5-10 seconds, others 30 sec to a few minutes, or never. Custom matches are better..but the same high ping can creep up on you.
3. There are at LEAST a few thousnad hackers using aimbots, wall detection, unlimited ammo etc. in Black Squad on different servers, look on youtube for yourself https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzI1Gx4IW18 
4. Guns can feel the same old same old after a while, and having (at most) two attachments which are the laser sight and silencer (minus the scopes and grenade launchers which you can't take off some guns). Would be nice if you can take these off, or get a forgrip for less recoil (Type 95 fans, I'm talking about us) or adding a stock, or extra magazines, or making your gun stock.
5. Running behind a wall, container, or some sort of cover that's not a wallbang (yellow surfaces with a bullet mark on it you can shoot through) and STILL getting killed, the tick server time is terrible, it's like bf3-bf4 problem in the past.
6. And Several other things that will bite you in the ass one way or another.

I'm not the type of guy that complains, hell one time I beated a 10 (40 for 100%) hour single player game on low settings at 10-15 fps (SR3) on a potato and put up with its flaws and quirks, yet this game...

I just can't tolerate it, and I have pretty good performance on it getting about 40-50 fps but that's not the problem .

TL:DR

Overall...as much as I love this game...as much as I would LOVE to recommend this game to someone, and as much as this game holds a dear place in my heart, I absolutely and simply, CANNOT do so, in its current state, terrible game, don't invest your time, money, effort, or skills in it, or you'll be disappointed wanting to jump back, but knowing your heart will be burdened even more."
18121,"One of the best FPS Free2Play games for sure.

Pros:

- No Pay2Win.
- Nice Seasonal events with Custom Maps/Gamemodes
- All weapons are permanent. 
- DLC's can be tested before you have to buy them.
- No skinned guns have no advantage over non-skinned weapon.


cons:
- Too small maps
- Awful quick matches queue times"
18122,It's too much point and click. 50% of kills are headshot
18123,Got sniped by a hacker called RicketDolphin. Otherwise solid game.

Why hipfire acc is pretty much the same as ads acc???
Remove ads or keep it and make it so hipfiring acc is terrible and only for really close quarters.
Needless to say i unistalled after 15-20 hours of this."
18130,csgo for noobs
18131,this game is just too easy you dont even have to aim i dont think you should have skill in order to be first you just hip fire and no matter if you are moving or standing you still have almost 90% accuracy not like you need to aim down sights you just hip fire and shoot and also it doesnt feel like there an encouragment for  accomplishments i mean after all its a free to play game there is no pay to win which always good

18145,decent i guess
18146,GG
18147,before I have problem during the game now on the start up I thought you fix the system already
18148,A good game but developers are too lazy to update the game...they just update the game with skins and new event points...smgs are op which makes it the worst
18149,"It's kind of unusual for me to review games with so little time spent with them but I'm certain I won't know much more after another 200 hours wasted anyway.

So what can you expect from Black Squad? Well it's like Counter Strike had some weird child with Call of Duty, but opposed to those two games it's fun.
The netcode is horrible all around, the community is among the worst communities I've ever seen in my whole 19 years of FPS experience, the UI is horrible, the english translation is about the worst thing I have ever seen in my life, I can't seem to figure out if this is a russian or korean game, characters yell ""TAC RELOAD"" all the damn time and about 90% of matches you'll find some guy who you simply can't seem to kill at all.

But even with those flaws the game is still fun, though I don't know about the competetive scene, as I never bothered with that in any game. If you are just a simple guy who earns $600 a month and works a job you hate you'll find this game is a nice time waster once you come back from work and just want to shoot random people over the internet. 
Progression is not too slow nor too fast, so you don't have to grind indefinetly to get a new shiny firearm nor do you instantly get bored with getting everything. At about 15 hours I got about 1/4th of the entire arsenal without paying a dime.

Overall great game, probably the 4th best free to play game on steam."

18176,"[h1]Definitely worth investing time into![/h1]

Many of you are looking for a new place to call home right? You've seen Black Squad and you're skeptical about leaving your main game to come and shoot some melons here aren't you. I'm here to completely reassure you and to let you know that when you join Black Squad, you will not be wasting your time, not at all. [b]Scroll down if you wish to read further.[/b]

I was highly skeptical upon hearing about the game and I immedaitely put on my detective outfit and jumped straight onto youtube to look at videos of it. ""Hm, yeah, doesn't look too bad, yeah, yeah.."" And so the game was downloaded.

Upon arrival in the game I was slightly overwhelmed with the UI as I found the inbox system where you receive mail/rewards was made much more difficult than it really needed to be. The UI in general was a bit meh but after an hour you get used to it and think nothing of it, so don't worry. As a strict F2P player I scouted around the regular shop which contains bits and bobs that you buy with the currency you obtain through just playing the game. I then hopped into the 'Medal Shop' where the donator items are. I compared the same gun models from the regular shop to the gun of the same name/type etc to the medal shop. It's comforting to know that the guns you get from donating(BS/BULLETS) are [b]EXACTLY[/b] the same as the ones in the regular shop. [b]THE MEDAL SHOP MERELY SELLS YOU SKINS FOR THE GUNS[/b]. But of course it is obvious that if you for example didn't have an AK47 in your inventory, and you bought the AK47 Legendary with 10k BS coins then you will get the gun with the skin.

[h1]Now let's talk about the actual gameplay and mechanics of the game.[/h1]

I was very pleased when I hopped into my very first match and I loved the simplistic look the UI has, apart from the character you've equipped in the bottom right, that's very pointless and shouldn't be there whatsoever. I ran around copped a few kills and noticed the recoil on guns are actually fun. I was using the ARX and absolutely hated it because I can't control the damn thing with this horrible £10 office mouse.

I played for some hours and managed to rack up enough medals (you get them through leveling up and opening crates which you also get from leveling up) so I bought an AK47, of course. I thought it'd be easier to use the AK47 as I thought it was the OP gun (it somewhat is) however it does require skill. [b]ALL[/b] guns require some level of skill to use and not every gun will be for you. Everything feels fluid all the way from the satisfying crunching sounds of when you get a headshot, to standing on a claymore and flopping out like a dead fish. 

In conclusion, I strongly recommend that you put this game on download and investing a good few levels into it (at least SGT R4) so you can get a feel for the game properly with all modes etc. I haven't seen any PW2 aspects whatsoever in my hours played because donating money into the game will only give you cosmetic rewards such as skins, characters etc. I currently have had no problems with lag in the EU servers as I live in the UK and my ping has always comfortably sat at 38-45.

I hope to see you in game!"
18177,"""absolutely no Pay-to-Win"" is untrue. Paying vastly speeds up the process of unlocking weapons and items which give you an outrageous advantage. This wouldn't be so bad if balance wasn't so horrible. Apart from that it's a very fun game. Most maps are made well. Grenades are a little too spammy, but you only get one per life at the most, so it's not so bad/"

The guns are super OP and players can use machine guns to instantly kill you with a machine gun shooting your foot.

So every time I shoot 7 and they kill me with one I feel hopeless

That should tell you everything about the spirit of this game. It doesn't get any better from there."
18206,"It was quiet one of my favorite FPS games, but the devs decided to change the market policy and completely ruined it. Now it's not worth playing eventhough it's free to play. The game was in some ways evolving better than similiar games in its genre but now it is going to be thrown away because of some smart decisions the devs made! IMO don't waste your time on a game when the developers do not value the users, simple."
18207," One of the best games I've played!

Good sides:
-A lot of modes,
-A lot of guns,
-A lot of tutorials 
-Very beatiful graphic on medium or high

-It's hard to find hackers in this game

Bad sides:
-Bad ping,
-Sometimes FPS going down!

Mark:10/10"
18208,I REALLY LIKED THAT ITS A FREE GAME BUT STILL THE QUALITY OF GAMEPLAY IS REALLY AWESOME. ALTHOUGHT THERE SOME BUGS IN THE GAME I REALLY LIKED IT. 10/10 FOR ME
18209,not pay to win
18210,Nice game :D Big up
18211,cool game love the animation
18212,Best Fps game in free.. I like it😂😂
18213,"If you like classic first person shooters like COD, CSGO, And battlefield, this is the game for you. It's perfectly and very well put together not to mention that its free, personally i'd rather play this then waste my money on COD, CSGO, Or battlfield on steam"
18214,this game just op
18215,An extremely addicting FPS. This game nearly works better than the COD port to PC. I love this game and it is great to play with friends. Take the plunge and download this game.
18216,Not Skyrim.
18217,Game is really good for free to play
18218,"Good Game, a little clunky"
18219,A great first person shooter well balanced very fun.
18220,"Not to fun of a game, the hitboxes are messed up and it is a PAY 2 WIN game.


Edit:
CM_Rocky (I Think you are a Dev...) But the Boost which cost Bullets, which are purchased with Real life Money. The Boosts for Gold and EXP get you More EXP and Gold if I am correct. The More Gold and EXP you get the faster and easier it is to get ""Better"" weapons and other items from Lvl up Crates. (I may be Wrong about all of this) A New Person who has just joined vs a new player with boostes play 3 games together. The Player with boosts would have ""Better"" in game items. (I really don't trust myself with these facts) If I am wrong I am sorry for calling your Game a PAY 2 WIN."
18221,"Not that great of a game, it is free but there are better free games and cheap games than this."
18222,This game is aesome
18223,Superb!
18224,"This game lags on my PC, but i have an amazing and powerful PC that can run games like forza 7 at ultra at 60+fps. If anyone has a solution or are having the same problem, let me know. Summary - This game has horrible optimization."
18225,"It's about all you can expect from a free to play, fun for a bit, but honestly starts to get boring pretty quick."
18226,nice game but toom any cheater
18227,"i love to play Black Squad, as it is only request is like to reward bullet as well and add 1 male character or female character to start with as a choice. <3"

18230,"One of the best online FPS out there. Must try!!!
There's a game mode for all the gamer types, DESTRUCTION, TDM, DEMOLITION and main thing is that its 100%F2P only thing one can do with money is buy skins or random boxes which don't effect the gameplay at all!"
18231,"Fairly decent f2p shooter-basically a mix of call of duty and csgo. netcode is decent, but not super special. Community is full of whiners who think everybody who kills them is a hacker.  Overall if you like running around and shooting things you might like this game.


Edit: forgot to add that this game is really not pay2win. Some weapons are definitely better than others, but they are so easy to get and all the guns kill so fast anyway it hardly mattters"
18232,infested with hackers
18233,Best Game EVER!!!
18234,"when this game was on early access it was legit proved better version of cs:go but as u know its free now there are tons of hackers,bug,system crashes,faulty windows support,trash gun system and bullet targeting,even then went so far they mixed whole server in one crap and doesn't even make sense at all and developers don't give a damn about what community is asking am done with this game i wasted 1500 hrs on it in the hope that it will improve but i give up i cant find solid pro's in game all hackers and OP gun user exsist here don't waste your time you will end up having stress or depression"
18235,best than csgo
18236,Call of Duty with mobile game graphics and menus. Free is nice tho.

18254,"As of now, pretty shitty. The maps are garbage, game always lags, nothing is balanced."
18255,"I, like you, went how is this game any better than all the rest I have played this year well the answer is simply is just plain fun. I haven't had so much fun playing a game dying ,killing ,shooting ,dying again as I have had with this game and long time. I've only clocked in about 28 hours into it but it's addictive and it's not like the oh there's a button I must press addictive it's something a little bit more visceral the guns have a nice cathartic thump to them all and they all sound like they should. I wish that this company would make a actual like retail gain of this sort without all the loot boxes and everything and I think they could sell it for easily full price and I would pay for it."
18256,keeps freezing up when im in game and wont come back. no its not my computer. if anyone can help please do.

true story"
18261,i like this game <3
18262,"absolutely terrible, utter shit. weapons are unbalanced as all hell, the bullet spread is ridiculous, cant hit anything you aim at, virtually no health at all, have to buy grenades to use them (by using a microtransaction mind you) and just as many hackers and mod users as CS-GO. not worth the rage quit in my opinion. maybe once the developers fix a few many things i will give it a go again, but for now....no. especially when someone can fire a sniper rifle through 4 walls and kill you in one hit, but it takes 2 when an enemy is in plain sight."
18263,"One of the best FPS Free2Play games for sure. It's like a mix between Call of duty and Counter-strike,

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

- Easy to learn but Hard to Master
- Free DLC's for new Players to test out most Guns before having to buy them.
- No Pay2Win.
- Nice Seasonal events with Custom Maps/Gamemodes
- All weapons are permanent. (Only nades aren't)
- Cosmetic Weapon doesn't not have advantage over non-cosmetic weapon.


[h1]cons:[/h1]
- Too little maps
- No Clan emblems 
- Sometime FPS will drop to unplayable level. (Need to restart the game to fix it)
- Those who are still alive in game, they cannot see chat from dead.
- Awful quick matches queue times ( There are times that i waited for 3 minutes)
[strike] - Broken steam achivement ( I had join a clan in September 2017 but early December 2017, they introduce steam achievement, i didn't receive that achievement)[/strike] 
- Feeders from winning team like to say "" EZ""
- People keep on spaming radio message

Update  10 Jan 2018:
Join clan achievenemt is fixed."
18264,"I just love this game, i have been playing for about a year. Low hardware requirements, great gamesplay, just an oveall great game. I recommend trying it to see for yourself."

Pros:
-Many different options
-Daily awards for login
-Lot of in-game purcashable content
-Easy to understand controls and interface
-Variety of game modes

Cons:
-Game physics
-Weapon recoil 

But at the end - it’s free to play game and gives quite a lot fun to enjoy it. 


If You are looking for free fps game to kill some free time - I recommend You this game!"

18272,This game is cool
18273,b u l l s h i t game ever
18274,This game is full of hackers with wall hacks and aimbots. You meet 1 hacker : 3 matches. The game only focuses on making money from their Cash shops and not fixing the hack issues.

And i'm okay with that.

Nice time killer, otherwise, nothing special."
18276,Best game ever
18277,"If you're looking for a free multiplayer FPS, this one is the best. It's also almost similar to CS:GO, which is good if you're low on budget."

18280,10/10 too bad it's dead in NA :(!
18281,iss pretty gud
18282,"Don't get me wrong I love this game. But the incompetence shown in many key parts made me write a negative review.

THE MAPS: The worst things I have ever seen in my life. Normally 2 routes making 2 huge chokepoints. Wait it gets worse. Everyone has a grenade launcher and a grenade. Grenade spam heaven.     

GUN BALANCE: Many of the guns are just bad. The snipers are super op.      

STUPID THINGS: None of the damage stats mean anything because every player is equipped with a ""flak jacket"" that reduces bullet damage. So don't even look at the damage stat of guns because it means nothing.

GRENADE SPAM: Every assault rifle has a grenade launcher. Most players have a frag grenade and a smoke grenade. Combine this with the awful maps and it is a disaster.
"
18283,"A very fast paced fps. This is an amazing game i would pay five dollars for this if it costed money, but it's free!

18294,Really nice Free to Play game. To enjoy with some Friends!
18295,"If you come from CS:GO DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME, this game doesn't need skill to master since everyone is just running and jumping while shooting. The recoil is not present in most guns which makes the game have less skill cap which makes the game very bad. Although I recommend this to noobs who cannot aim for some reason cause you can just run and jump which can help you become a very hard target to hit."
18296,"Grenades are broken
Community sucks
animations are lazy 
Controls are clunky
gunplay sucks
you run really slow (Even while sprinting) (Which is middle mouse btw)

18303,"A very generic F2P FPS, the only thing that stands out are the nice graphics.

It has most of the issues that typical F2P FPS games have like uninspired leveles, boring guns, bland at best music, tiny maps where you can die to someone who's still under spawn protection even though you've only made a couple of steps out of yours, dry as saltine crackers voice acting that makes you question what the point of spending money on it was, etc.

If you're wanting to just drop into a random match once in a while to shoot up some dudes without much commitment then this is a decent game for it, but I don't see anyone getting a whole lot out of this game if they were to dedicate their time to it.

Notable Pros:
- Relatively small download
- Decent amount of in-game currency, you can buy a few weapons of your choosing permanently to start out
- Seems to run pretty well
- Community seems decent, some people were really helpful
- Quick tutorial, won't waste much of your time


If you just want to play a quick FPS match once in a while, there's a lot worse out there."

18310,"Amazing combination of COD and CS, with variety of mods to try like TDM, VIP, Demolition or Battle mode this game is probably one of the best FPS currenty, and it is free, so give it a try and you wont regret it"
18311,No NA servers.
18312,"It's good fun even if a bit repetitive.
If you just want a bit of brainless Deathmatch shooting in the same style as the Call of Duty franchise and don't have that much time in your life to immerse  yourself, then this is a game for you.

*** EDIT ***

So after playing another 20 hours or so I have a few more comments.
It loads really fast so it's fun.  I stand by the repetitive comment above; I'd really like to see a few more maps.

After a while, I can't be bothered to open the box or frankly answer any of the emails.  
It takes quite a bit of grinding to get to new and better weapons.  Quite frankly, the P90 is a wonderful ""sprayer"" with a mag of 50.  Terrific fun when the others need to change a mag.

I find the handling of the grenades a bit annoying; I trying to work out how to find a better keyboard set up so that I can just throw the frag and not have to cycle through all my weapons again.  That time delay gets me killed.

The knife is not that good.  It's a bit too slow on attack.  I'd like to see the possibility to get rid of everything (all guns, grenades and flak jacket) in exchange for being able to run really fast with a knife. 

Pretty addictive game."

18333,"good game, played it for around 300 hours would recommend to anyone who wants a good FPS which is free!

its not a pay to win game and has none of these crappy buy a lootbox system to get the good guns you can get any gun you want in the game all you have to do is play and save up your coins and medals however if you do want to pimp yourself out with a cool looking character or a cool skinned gun then you can purchase these but those of us who like to free to play there is the even boxes which you win for doing challanges which give you limited time use of the skinned weapons/items/characters.

imo this game is a 10/10 even if there is a couple of game bugs here and there"

18344,nice came
18345,i like very nice
18346,"Very fun game. I won't do a pro and con because everyone does it.. Instead I want to address something I have seen a lot both in game and in the reviews. 
Hacking. There is none. If there is it must be a very small percent of players, and even then I occasionally see that the anti hacking software this game uses kicks people out of games. But only sometimes. Maybe they were hacking or maybe it was just a glitch, who knows.

What I do know, is it is very easy to kill people. Like 1 bullet to the head, maybe 3-6 to the body. So if you have good reflexes and shoot first, chances are you are going to win. Because of this, I see some people accusing others of using aimbot or wallhacks. Like today when someone accused me -_-
I guarantee its just as simple as people pre-aiming corners, and having better reflexes. This game is played a lot like CS:GO, so simply running around like in CoD wont do you any good. 

Guns are very balanced. So if you go full on power, you lose a lot of stability and accuracy. And visa versa. Default weapons can suit you just fine, and you do get a lot of gold to start with. There is a currency based on real money, but the things you by with it are not much different than the ones you buy with gold other than the look. So there isnt any real disadvantages for any players, even if they are new.

Lucky shots are really easy to get. My last game I killed 4 people in a row just by moving a little and shooting at their heads. More often then not, one of them would have killed me though. I would say 95% of the gunfights are fair. A lot of things to be careful of: Snipers, again not like CoD(they hardscope because thats how you use them). So if you duck your head out somewhere, dont start calling ""hacker"" if you get shot by one.

Most of the people playing, including me, seem to absolutely hate when crybabies in the chat are yelling about aimbot or hacking.. But if you are a very defensive player, you will probably do good. But it depends on the maps, the people on each team, and a bit of awareness. I promise you, nobody is aimbotting or hacking. It is really just that easy sometimes to kill people. Another reason, because you have 100 health(in percent).. When its gone, its gone. So if you lose 50%... you are at 50%. There is no regen. So more often than not, you are either shooting at someone with less than their full health. And the same happens to you. And the guns in the game feel like they are very responsive and quick to draw. So someone with really good reflexes may be able to turn corners and kill people just as fast. 

I understand why people would call ""wall hacking"" or aimbot but its not. I have done it plenty of times, its really easy. Especially when you know each map and you sort of get how firefights work and where people will be positioned. But I would really, highly doubt anyone is hacking. I wouldn't even accuse anyone in any of the games I have played so far of hacking. Sometimes I get killed I its like ""what just happened.."". But I am sure if you assume that they were eitehr pre-aiming, looking in your direction already, saw you on the minimap (Oh yeah, if you should you tend to be on the minimap for a while and it tracks you. So thats also a significant reason). If you have more awareness than the other person, I am sure you will win. 

p.s It would be swell if anyone intended to play doesnt just start screaming in all caps in the chat that someone is cheating. Not on team chat, and not on all chat. Its annoying as hell, nobody likes it."
18347,"After sinking some hours into it, I can say that this game has potential. First, it runs smooth even on a potato laptop as mine, and second, you really can't feel any P2W aspect here (at least I didn't notice), as you can get 99% of the weapons for free or by earning medals, so I don't think it's unfair for F2P players such as me. Also, the weapons are well balanced, and you WILL most certainly find a weapon suiting your playstyle. Even then, you will switch to another and realize that that weapon is better for certain situations/maps, so it keeps the gameplay fresh. Also, SNIPING WORKS, hitboxes are smooth. And with all the updates going on with some new weapons here and there and new maps implemented regularly, I'd greatly recommend this game to any MMOFPS-fans out there, I got to like it really quickly. Props to the devs for caring about us, the players and the game and constantly updating it!"

18353,nice game
18354,"Ok, so Black Squad could be great. In fact, if you play with friends, it probably will be. However, I'm a solo queuer, and the game's true colors shine when you play as a solo queuer that is new to the game.

So my story goes like this. It was literally my second game, my first game was spent in a TDM gamemode that wasn't all too fun and didn't feel very tactical, so I switched over to a 5v5 demolition mode very similar to Counter-Strike. The mode itself was fun, but an issue became pretty clear. The community with this game is absolutely terrible. I've met bad apples in Counter-Strike, but my first time playing CSGO on casual the people on my team actually gave up the win to help me out in learning the game, and it made sense, it wasn't a comp match. Now here's how Black Squad went, in what was NOT a comp match btw, but CASUAL. Throughout the match the team was constantly saying things along the lines of ""just leave,"" and ""useless."" These are not the types of things a welcoming community would be saying. Anyway, I ended the match with a 2/7 KD and even though my team won, they still continued to attack me post-round. This is just my experience, and this review is negative because of it.

The rest of the review is based purely on aspects of the base game, not my experiences with its playerbase.

Graphics:
The game is actually great in this regard. I had to play the tutorial in the wrong aspect ratio, low resolution, and low graphic settings in general simply because the options menu is not available until AFTER the tutorial is completed. However, once I tweaked the settings, the look of the game drastically improved into a pretty decent looking piece of work.

Gunplay:
Here is where the game can sort of lack. The guns feel good to play with, but it really feels like there are only four or five guns just reskinned with different stats. If two guns are in the same class, it's likely they will feel the same while playing.

Microtransactions:
They're unavoidable in free games like this. The game doesn't feel pay to win in the beginning, with free guns being thrown at you constantly as you level up rapidly early on. However, these guns have time limits ranging from as long as 5 days to 24 hours before you lose them. If you actually want to accumulate guns, expect to grind out for a while or dish out some real cash. 

Overall, don't play this game unless you have a group of friends, because otherwise you will be subject to abuse. Just better hope the other team doesn't attack you in chat even with your friends (because the other team sure did join in with my team)..."

18358,"Sprays with rifles aren't a thing, burst every first 3 bullets then it's all random bullet spread. Overall very good for a free game nice skins and animations."
18359,"wow i just installed this game because it looks ok. 

pros.  
1.its new and im bored on waiting for pubg to do its 10gb update. 
.............................
cons.  
1. the maps are so small 1 nade from spawn is almost in there spawn. i bet you 90% you will make a kill. 
2. its run gun and die. 
3. 3 skills are needed for this junk. 
4. this looks and feels like a reskin of the game WARFACE. however even warface looks better and has bigger maps. 
5. and again after playing for like 30 mins. (3 games) to use the other weps it looks like its pay to win.  
6 the games a joke. i played like 4 matches. and was top  every game. most kills. and most score. 
7 uninstalling this junk. early access. haha . needs to be screped. 
8  0 skills needed. 0 aim needed.     eg.,   i was ADS. picked off a enemy with 2 or 3 hits.   but when i hipfire i nailed a headshot and was a 1 or 2 hit to kill every time. im done with this game. uninstalling. never playing again. 

no i do not recommend this junk to anyone.  

for real if you suck at gaming. and only have 1 hand to play , and are dead in both ears and are partly to fully blind. and have 1/8th of a brain. 
then maybe just maybe this game is for you.  but i doubt it.

18360,"great game, fun and realistic. at first it might not be fun but 5 mins later its one hell of a game 8/10"
18361,Can this be played with an Xbox one controller?
18362,"Black Squad is a military first-person-shooter game with gamemodes such as; 'Demolition' (Search and Destroy) in both the 5v5 en 8v8 variants. It has a 'war mode' which pits a large amount of players against eachother and a 'team-deathmatch' mode (8v8 I believe) The game has microtransactions which can be used to buy cosmetic in game items. NO PAY 2 WIN.

[h1] 6/10 and why [/h1]
[b] PROS : [/b]
Free 
Looks okay
Already a decent amount of content
No pay 2 win bullshit

[b] CONS : [/b]
VERY inconsistent damage pattern (shotguns are most noticeable)
Hitreg can be wonky at times
Occasional cheater now and then

The game concept has been around for a while. As search and destroy is most likely the main mode you will be playing, you can choose to play this with a team of 5 or a team of 8 people.
I have played a lot of 5v5 demolition so I am basing my review of my experience within that particular gamemode.

[b] WEAPONS/CUSTOMIZATION [/b]
There are a lot of weapons currently in Black Squad, with most of them also having custom paint-jobs (purchasable with 'Bullets' and 'BS Coins' (will get to this later) there is a certain amount of customizing you can do. Unfortunately there isnt a way to equip a custom scope, grip or whatever. You can equip a silencer (F) or laser (T) whilst in a match. This does not work from the main menu.

[b] CURRENCY AND CASES [/b]
Microtransactions in this game are completely optional and weapons bought using this currency does not give any advantage over the other weapons! 
In this game you can buy [b] 'Bullets' [/b] which can be used to buy either player skins, weapon with skins or [b] cases [/b].
Cases can give you a variety of items, including [b] 'BS Coins' [/b].
You can use BS Coins to buy calling cards, weapon skins and also playermodels. However these coins can not be used to purchase more cases and are not convertable into regular gold. 

[b] DAMAGE INCONSISTENCY, HITREG & SERVERS [/b]
Black Squad uses their own dedicated servers, which are located in multiple regions. I, as a Dutch player have never experienced any kind of server lagg or ping issues.
The problem lies with the hitreg though, unfortunately you can and will be killed by some absolute bullshit. But you too will kill people by absolute bullshit. In some cases aiming close to a player can already result in hitting them, which makes me suspect the hitboxes to be a little larger than the actual characters. This could also be a result of a form of lagg, where you would kill your opponent, whenthe server has already processed that information, there might be a slight delay between you and the server. Meaning the opponent dies a bit later, so it looks like bullets that didnt hit killed him
DAMAGE INCONSISTENCY!!!
This one is kind of a pain in the butt, this problem is most obvious with shotguns. For example; The KSG can one shot a person within 5 meters of you. This occasionally happens, but other times it will require 2 or more shots to actually kill someone from point blank range. Which makes it really frustrating if someone pushes you and the damage output of the shotgun was not enough to kill the opponent, resulting in your death. This problem occurs occasionally and has resulted in some really unecessary deaths. 

ALL IN ALL A DECENT GAME, IF THIS DAMAGE CONSISTENCY WILL BE FIXED I WOULD GIVE THIS GAME A 8.5/10
For now this game will stay a 6/10
"
18363,"Review from a competitive style player, +400 hours played.

Positives:
+Free
+No pay to win
+Responsive movement and aim
+Generally the game runs well with good fps (couple map exceptions)

Negatives:
-Incompetent devs [b]on a mission to make money[/b] by porting empty content from the Korean version instead of actual development
-Toxicity increasing and [b]clunky clan mechanic instead of proper ranked matchmaking[/b]
-[b]High ping gives you advantage[/b] (+ping limit is over 300 before they [sometimes] get kicked)
-Broken sounds (game-breaking silent falling, horrible positional audio)
-Mediocre, even horrible map designs
-No map queue, no map veto
-Unrewarding, basically [b]nonexistent (ranked) rank system[/b]
-Recent [b]spike in amount of cheaters and abusers, devs slow or don't act[/b]
-No in-game reporting
-No spectate
-Poor practice opportunities for teams due to custom game limitations
-Laughable skin system with [b]horrible drop rates, no steam marketplace[/b], 100% useless pity currency (BS coins) from boxes (couple percentages of the craft value as the best drop)
-Totally unrewarding and poorly planned community events, prizes for winners are insulting, often equal to couple euros in monetary value (to give more context, proper skins in this game take upwards of 100 euros to acquire per skin, and they can't be sold for any money back)
-Often [b]awful quick game match balancing[/b]
-Flashbangs are totally useless

If you look for a competitive experience, do yourself a favor and don't make the mistake of investing time and money in this game."

18365,"I want to like this game but I just can't.

Run and gun simulator, balance is thrown out of the window, so many similar weapons. The servers are fairly bad and the community is eh-ish : not too friendly, not abysmal. It gets boring after a while too. It doesn't try to reinvent stuff, but it copies stuff, and badly so.

18367,"At first I was a bit skeptical about this game but after playing it I got hooked immediately. It's almost as if Call of Duty and Counter-Strike had a baby. But besides that this game is fairly face-paced and action oriented. Therefore there are barely any times where you aren't shooting your handy dandy killing thingy. Not only that but the graphics aren't so shabby, did I mention that this game runs on an old Dell laptop that has an Intel Core i3 on it? OH! I ALMOST FORGOT TO MENTION!

18387,"Black Squad is a good contender for an FPS player if looking for a fun fps game that is also free to play.

What can I say about Black Squad, its an FPS game, its free, micro transactions are non pay to win, its visually pleasing to look at, the gunplay is good.

This game feel like a mix of Counter strike meets call of duty, it feels good. Its a game anyone can get into and have a good time, but it can also be played on a competitive level. 

The game is well optimized, mechanics are good, gameplay feels fluid and not clunky.

Overall it is a quality F2P title, a solid FPS title, and in general a good shooter.

Highly recommended, its free to play give it a shot."

The battle system works good, you can get a freel 14 day trail on a couple of weapons  and other tacticals. You can buy them later with a little bit in in game currency, you get that by playing its pretty cheap. Most of it at least.

There is some Pay to play, but you dont need it because of the small difference they make. Also, the maps work quit good, yess there are a couple of bitchy places but ones you know them it gets easier to kill them. 

And last point, it is free. Instal it play for a round or 2 and decide wether you like it or not. 
Dont like it? Then uninstall.
Like it? Keep playing more."

18435,"This game is good, as all at it stays Not PTW!"
18436,"Black Squad
-A free-to-play FPS Shooter which involves lots of grenade kills.
-Yes. *sigh* Grenade Kills.

-I was looking for some free-to-play game to play with my friends and our search ended on Black Squad.
-The game has really great graphics, the gun reload animations are perfect, the details like how slow you move when you have a heavy gun literally effects a lot, i know it's normal but this game will let you feel it, the agitation to walk slow when you're holding a Heavy Machine gun is real.

-The game runs well above 60fps at 1440x900 on ultra in my PC.
-This game is sort of like having a concept to combine CSGO and COD, because it has bomb demolition matches and also has a COD feel to it.
-The maps are sort of puzzling when playing for the first time but 60% of maps are mirror images from the centre.
-Some maps are fast paced while some involves hiding and sniping, nevertheless you will enjoy it a lot.
-It does have some microtransactions by which you can purchase ingame medals and golden ammos to buy special guns or you can grind your rear off and slowly earn the ingame currency then purchase guns, if i were you and i did it infact so to say, i grinded and purchased weapons since it's purely based on your skills.
-The grenade is one such stuff by which you'll be getting a lot of kills or you'll be getting killed a lot. The twist is, the grenade is not permanently in your inventory, it's sort of like rent it for 1 day and play with it for whole 1 day/24 hours.
The renting cost is 3.5k which you can afford, and i'll suggest purchasing it because you are gonna get killed a lot with grenades. A. LOT.

-The community is pretty good, i have met few good people on demolition matches.
-The game music could have been better and more adrenaline filled type, i have turned down the ingame volume and i play some song on discord and then play the game. MUCH. BETTER.

-Devs if you're gonna read this please improve the music.

On a scale of 11.
9/11

EDIT 1 : 
- I just discoverd they have some free DLCs which allow you to try out their awesome unpurchased guns for 15 days.
-Also there is one fortune box, add it in your game and open it, IF you're lucky you'll get some dope gun with a skin. *.*

EDIT 2 :
- Stabbing the enemy team with knife is pretty easy.
-If you have a quick reflex you can literally chain knife kills, my max streak was 5. XD 
-I got the achievement unlocked, Butcher (30 knife kills/30 melee kills) XD
-Knife people in Team Death Match, not in Demolition. (T&C applied)

EDIT 3 :
Still not regretting anything from my review XD
PS : I got a Samurai achievement for 100 melees XD (111 in my stats)"

18459,pens
18460,This game is not to bad to play
18461,"Its like CSGO and COD combined, alot of run and gun tho."
18462,"So I would say this is the best F2P FPS shooter I've played but the truth is, Ironsight seems more enjoyable.

 If you're any bit curious about this game and you enjoy twitch shooters, then just try the game out. If you played AVA, Cross Fire or Combat Arms, this is essentially those games but better and newer, and less clunky. The mechanics in this game feel very smooth much like Cross Fire.
 It has TDM so you can get a quick feel for the game and decide whether or not you like it realtively quick.

As always, there are a few minor issues that may deter you from joining in or playing for long periods of time.
All the weapons are balanced and the paid weapons are only skins and do not effect the stats of the weapons themselves. That alone is great! 
Leaving the game clear of the P2W factor that haunts every other F2P game out there. Let's hope it stays that way.

So what is the bad then? Well, sometimes lag gets into play and it can be very noticeable from time to time. The game allows you to hop onto any region you wish so the chances of playing against 150+ ping players is really high. At first you may not really feel the lag since you're just getting used to the game but after a while, you'll realize that there's some split-second shots that don't seem to line up with what actually happened on your screen. Lag is always going to be in the game but I do believe that Black Squad does its best to keep things as close as possible. At least, it seems like it does a decent job of not having the lag be overly obvious like in other games.

In regards to overall content, the game is pretty light but it does have a fair number of maps for the different game modes so I can't complain. The weapon variety is claimed to be light but if you're just starting, there'll be enough weapons to keep you busy for a while.


[b]The Catch:[/b]

So there's 2 stores 1 that uses ""gold"" which is the in-game currency you get while playing the game.
And the other store uses ""medal"" which is the in-game currency you get while playing the game, only not as much as gold. 
If you keep playing and leveling up, you'll obtain enough medal to buy 1 gun within the first 10 - 15 hours in my experience. I joined in at a time where there were exp+ and gold+ bonuses so it may take a little longer depending on how well you play and how often you play. 

That being said, Gold currency weapons are typically easier to obtain but they do have a drawback. None of the assault rifles are 1 hit headshots. This is insanely crucial in twitch shooters like this, but most of these weapons have controllable recoil so it shouldn't take too much to land 2 headshots one after the other.

The medal currency weapons are where you get your 1-shot headshots. The SR47, AK47 and AK12 being the more popular of the rifles. Their drawback is that they have an insane recoil that can be difficult to control. Which forces you to tap-fire and burst-fire most of your shots. The medal weapons aren't just exclusively high recoil/high damage weapons. There's also the MDR and the M4 which have low recoil but lesser damage. It depends entirely on your play style but if you do miss getting those 1 hit headshots, you will have to devote a little bit of time, or money to get the medal currency weapon you want."
18463,"i hope they balance gernade launcher in this game, there is much too gernade launcher attachment on gun make the gun looks silly and heavy"
18464,"It is a good game but there seems to be alot of Cheaters (keep spoting ppl using aimbot etc when in death-cam) in-game.
Didn't see them getting banned or other punishments.
Hope this majority problem would be fixed or dealt with ASAP or the game will be ruinned by them."
18465,"Yes, this game is totall worth your time with interesting modes and perfect gameplay. This is not pay to win game while you can buy most of the guns just by level up. It's sort of like COD mix with CSGO. More and more players are joinging the game now as I could see from playing this game daily 1 to 3 hours. Would recommend to everyone. Add me if you like to play with me.. my game ID is AJTran
btw, melee mode is a big plus if ya'll have ever played Crossfire."
18466,"top game universe, I played alot"
18467,"Dear Black Squad and players,

This game should not be free and I'm willing to pay because Black Squad is deserved guys!!!

Please do not play 1 match and say or judge that this game is suck. You need to play and find out tips and tricks as well as accumulate experience after every single match day by day, so that you possibly know what is Black Squad!!!

IMPORTANCE:

- This time is just an earlier access, therefore, there are absolutely many improvements to satisfy and comfort to your game's experience.

- Also, from my perspective, I hope that this game will have an auction which can be sold and purchased items. Afterwards, Devs can have profit from commission (adjust based on the amount of money) in many deals we made (win-win situation). For example, I luckily owned 2 same knifes in gold boxes and it would be great if I can sell it to other players.

- If an auction is feasible, I recommend that it is just took place either on Saturday or Sunday only and players will put their items on the list which is announced to all of players on every morning day, so they will have sufficient time and preparations until the auction comes.

ALL OF ABOVE IS ABOUT MY OPINIONS, with me, I have already satisfied with this game right now and wish you a smashing New Year filled with laughter.

THANK YOU GUYS TAKE TIME TO READ MY REVIEW.

for the most part there isn't any true pay to win in this game although spending money can certainly speed up the obtaining of guns everything can be bought at start once you have currency and knowing what is best to get will give you a advantage

has steam market


i can't recommend this game for the following reasons:
the devs are more focused on weapon skins/seasonal events then fixing real time issues such as latency or stability
there is a memory leak on this game
customer support is almost always terrible and late in responding

this game's netcode is one of the worst out there
if you live near EU server or near US-East server your set for life on this game to everyone else you teleport, godmode and use aimbots through walls
NEVER PLAY US-WEST SERVER it's practically unplayable

this game needs a 2k pc to run at fps above 100 on lowest settings
even then the fps is so incredibly unstable it seems to want to be at around 60fps no matter what fps you pull in on your pc you will see dips down to around there, worse yet any attempt to lock it in at 60 results in drops to 1fps and after that expect 1fps every few or so times someone shows up on your screen after reverting your settings

don't play this game, don't support it by buying ""a chance"" at weapon skins
just avoid it in general 
only frustration at lack of support on a partially broken game that has had years to get it's act together can be found here"
18479,cool game and quite realistic for low pc's. i like it
18480,so  easy~~~~
18481,"I had fun.. It's a SEMI fast shooter.. Not Unreal or quak fast.. but not Arma or Swat slow.. I presume it's closer to Counter strike..

I played a tiny bit of TDM and I was on top every round for the first 5 games.. with over 25-40 kills and 15-0 Deaths each.. Then i think.. Hey demolition Is fun right? like CS with the bomb and limited lifes and tactic.. Well fuck me i was wrong..

Im not gona say the game is terrible, i had fun the little time it was so i recommend you to try yourself but that.. Mode.. Must be where the cheaters are playing. Something did not make any sense.. people i shoot did not die as they did in the earlier gamemode.. People constantly knew where i was hiding.. Even tho i crouched and sneaked around.. People rushed from both the attacker and defender side to both Bases before me.. even when i switched to the knife and just legged it there they still got there way before me on both.. Hell on one map the enemy had shooting sight on us from 10 feet ahead of our spawn.. but from our side when we went there.. We had to run 100m To get to that position.. 

I normally just think people are better then me.. Im not hardcore in shooters or in any game for that matter. .but it just did not make any sense.. there speed, there healthpoints.. there aim.. There movement.. How they got to spots before we did.. How they knew where we were.. So i googled and found almost over a 100 links to cheats for this game.. And checked up there Anti-cheat..  Maybe It's turned off? Or maybe there's some desnynch i dont know off? or maybe the game is just diffrent in diffrent modes? or maybe I just suck.. I guess..  Consider it's very positive..

Still to the point, recommend? Yes I do.. I do recommend you to take a look for yourself.. perhaps you fair better then i did."
18482,BEST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED MORE HARDWARE
18483,"10/10 Gave them 20 dollars and didnt get the items, Game crashed on menu and tried play again but apprently I was already logged in so i couldnt play, Uninstalled and reinstalled still didnt work. Overall best 10 minutes of menu gameplay ive ever had, Also the chinese is broken."
18484,Awesome Game Ever
18485,not good
18486,"This sort of games is plentiful on Chinese market. Cheap-looking, microtransaction-based ripped-off piece of garbage. Shitty netcode is included. Avoid at all costs."
18487,"Poor man's CS:GO 

Pros: Generous Daily login gold/rewards
         Not pay 2 win
         All guns obtainable through ingame gold/medals
         Easy to get most of the guns in game
         Fast match making

Cons: Laggers, hackers, broken match making system, camp heavy play style game, campers

Play when you are bored and looking for quick FPS match making action"
18488,quite good
18489,"Great game, love it"
18490,"CoD series + CS series = Black Squad
GOOD GAME :D"
18491,Nice Game GG
18492,Very good game . Should downlaod this game and play one of the best free to play game after dota2. Best shooting game for free games.
18493,This game looks like it was made by 12 year olds.
18494,"All the reviews telling you this is bland or trash, listen to em, I mean its not super horrible but it could definitely be better."
18495,This game is garbage
18496,p00r
18497,ITZ VERI GUUUD BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
18498,ITSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS FKNNNNNNNNNNNNN FREE. And pretty fun.
18499,eskere
18500,3/10 - Poor mans cod
18501,"It can be a good game,  if there were balanced maps, the defense team has a hard position sometimes especially in Demolition matches, whereas the defense is put to a low ground position and the attacking team has the high ground.

Also the ping of this game is good depending on your server. Since its still an Early Access game, we could only hope on its improvement. There's been 200+ pings with certain players, and that's gonna be bad if you want to shoot and eliminate them first. 

If you came from different shooters like CS:GO, COD, Battelfield, etc., don't touch this one. (in its Early Access state) 

Stick to your game. (for now)"
18502,Its okay its kinda bland and has nothing to really set it apart from any other shooter but its pretty good ui could use some work other than that its kinda fun.
18503,"As a CS:GO player (3k+ hours in the game) I really do enjoy this game. It's simpler than CS, but has more new content being put in. It's my ""relax"" shooter. I hope the devs don't destroy the game with stupid decisions. Also, BattleEye doesn't really offer anything new here, cheaters all around, but since I don't play this competitively I don't really mind it that much."
18504,"Great shooter. Haven't noticed any P2W. Won't say there aren't any hackers, but I have noticed people getting booted for cheating. Nothing has ruined the experience for me. So many nuances I really like. I never played CS:GO or COD but I really like this game and have done decent from the start. Love the sound and feel of the guns. They all have a unique sound and handling. I really like that when you kill someone it shows how many times they have killed you as well. The map call outs are really simple though I haven't used them in TDM yet.

Don't forget your grenade launcher when you get a rifle upgrade! Press 1 twice to select the rifle and switch to grenade mode. Love this feature."
18505,"cool game 

just that the maps r to small"
18506,"Similar to CS:GO, this game is very fun + free. How can you say no to a good free game?"
18507,"nice gaem, works in potatoes as well!"
18508,this game too hard for me
18509,"7/10
Haz probs but it gud game 
Free game too
 
Very gud and Very free
Reminds me of old game 
Ya know what I'm talking about bby 
Blackshot
Hav similarities
So vry biased

Bad thing mang
Needs more content 
Not gun skins that fuck with ur ego
Needs moar weapons that you can earn through playin bby



"
18510,Please create Aussie servers. I will then reinstall this game. Oh and thumbs up...
18511,"these are 3 common things in this game:
1. sh*tty hitregs for all
2. If you are looking for a ""one for all, all for one"" FPS game, you shouldn't choose this one.
3. Too many cheaters, non educated kids and unexpected languages.
"
18512,"Great For A Free To Play Game, Nice and Fast Pace FPS"
18513,very nice but i have noticed wall hackers recently but other then that it is fantastic
18514,Love this!
18515,best free fps for 2017...
18516,not a really good game
18517,"Solid game so far tho pings in SEA region aint so good ,"
18518,Really great and stable for a free to play game. A decent time killer with a balanced non pay to wil gameplay
18519,Such  a good game
18520,Really bland free to play shooter. Not sure why it has such good reviews. There are better free games to play.
18521,Its' not 1996. I don't remember what engine this runs on but it's shit.
18522,stop disapearing from me bruv man's getin vexed an all
18523,"Yt's very nice nice gamplay
"
18524,Great shooter and lots of fun. The problem for me though was that it doesn't include any proper competitive game mode.
18525,I Think I Recommend To This Game Beacause its a best highlight is is free to play and its combinantion of COD and CS I Think You Need To Add Some More Features On This Game First Your Shooting Cosept is amazing i never saw before and second amazing weapons and knife and axe but here no Top player leaderboards And Some Other Features Are Missing I Think everyone try this game once
18526,make ocianic servers
18527,"Its the Best Free to Play game and its not a [u]Pay to win[/u] its a [h1]Play[/h1]to win :) 
hope you all play it and thx for this nice Game."
18528,"THIS IS EASILY ONE OF THE BEST F2P SHOOTERS I HAVE EVER PLAYED, and i have played quite a few. This and Dirty Bomb and maybe TF2 are like the only good f2p shooters on steam right now!"
18529,Servers worse than CS:GO
18530,"no help what so-ever. at the moment i wouldnt reccomend the game. keep taking game off, and reinstalling the game i have the same error over and over. its so annoying. Its the 'anti-cheat software error'. before any say anythink i dont cheat what ever"
18531,"Just play it
"
18532,it good good
18533,this game sucks dont even lieing one of the worst free to plays fps ive have played not play THIS GAME
18534,great
18535,"this game changed my life, this game doesn't deserve to be free."
18536,My life was completed after launching this game
18537,I just like it Bottom Line!
18538,"basically pay to win fuck this game, its also full of hackers"
18539,"From what I have played...it is pretty fun...I had a pretty good first match going 20/2 and I enjoyed it. Although there are a lot of non-English speaking players, the community is friendly and accepting."
18540,"good F2P shooting, like it

update/
Welcome Steam Community Market
all attributes csgo skins, knifes. $$$"
18541,"Just another almost straight-line COD rip off. Similar control and game modes. Mediocre selection of guns, with the better guns purchased through in-game currency only obtainable through real world money, or HOURS AND HOURS of grinding... Small map rotation, which always breaks down into two phases: Grenade-fest, or no-scope crouching while jumping and side strafing headshot fest. Do you like aimbots?

Pros:
Free
Easy to learn

Cons:
Pay to Win
Grenades
Aimbots galore
Grenades
Game becomes boring quickly from small map rotation
Grenades
Small numbers of readily available, quality weapons that don't have to be purchased with real world money conversion
Grenades
Grenades
Grenades"
18542,It is atually a pretty good game. I'm a csgo player and love to sniping but I found out that sniping in this game is not smooth compare to csgo. And I think reload animation is not convinent at all. Once I put the mag in the gun it should be finish the reload like csgo and I don't have to wait for the animation finished. Otherwise I have to reload again. Same as reloading launch grenade.
18543,its good game
18544,men
18545,it was ight
18546,my name jeff
18547,"For a free game, this is very fun. Unlike a lot of others, this isn't a pay to win game either. The weapons you can earn over a few hours of playtime work just fine. About the only thing I wish was possible would be the ability to make new maps. The game feels pretty damn good as it is and if we were able to create our own maps, I feel this game would take off even more."
18548,Port it to x32bit you nignogs
18549,nice
18550,shitty korean game
18551,"if you are one of those that rage really hard i wil say then is not for you.... its take really long time to kil someone.
i have been played it did like it but when you have to take a long time to get a new wepon
ITS NOT LIKE CSGO"
18552,"“It’s a lot like Dark Souls” 
-God"
18553,"Just watch this video. 

it seems the ""mods"" are trying to hid something from us players. i'll just go ahead and repost this. the players have a right to know facts! 

https://youtu.be/P8k4W5F96Bo

11/3/2019 - thought i give it another shot. boy o boy was i wrong. this game is filled to the brim with cheaters. Do yourself a favor and just forget this trash game. ""Devs"" allow cheaters, no working battle eye , just complete trash. never Download. needs to be removed off of steam."
18554,"Well the game is a fast placed fps game its f2p so go and try it by your self!

All i missed wascapture the flag mode but thats what i preffer"
18555,"This could be a great game if they actually banned all the idiots who use esp and aim lock hacks... sad... 
I should add it is fun to play or rather troll the idiots who do hack, man do they get butt hurt!
And its no wonder there are so many hackers when the devs advertise hacks to download on the games website... smdh."
18556,love the game so good fro a free game keep up the good work
18557,needs more work but good game overall!!!high ping frequent interruptions!!!
18558,"the maps are copys of cod
"
18559,why i always get anti cheat error? i m not able to fix thing.
18560,Great game for the PC. Would like it to work on my Mac as well so I can play anywhere :)
18561,Game is great.
18562,"The game is good so far but it needs more things ,options like changing names- buying skins with medals , chat voice ... etc 
"
18563,"One of the best games i've played!
Best thing about this game ; No P2W, it's all skill dependent.

Best $Free ever spent xD"
18564,"So far in my Time playing Black Squad since the day of its release. It has been so far the BEST EVER First-Person shooter game by far of 2017 for FREE. No bugs, server issues, or anything has ever happened to me (I live in Eastern USA) and everyone is welcoming to each other. I did not get to sign up for Partnership with Black Squad, however I did recommend a streamer who signed up and is partnered with Black Squad that and he doesn't regret getting the game and joining me. 

If anybody reading this sees this comment and is looking for a good FPS game, *This* is the game for you try out! Don't miss out on this christmas' specials!"
18565,cool game
18566,nc game
18567,"Mse Csgoe vli free to play... Vse cs baza javabe
Mgn hack dre vli mn chizi ndidm ta alan 
:))"
18568,Good game all around. Combine CSGo and COD. The Only problem is that theres no OCEANIA SERVER. i have to play on a 234ms all the time. I would recommend the gameplay but cant recommend the game.
18569,"Ive been playing since the June of 2017 and its freaking good for a free 2 play, I would go so far as to say its on par with call of duty if not better because its free and runs better,"
18570,This game has become a pay to win game that can not be played in the oceania district due to its lack of servers in this area. There are too many wall hackers and it takes too many bullets to kill one person!
18571,Good game IF you can find a server.... ever.
18572,better than cod
18573,"Convenient management, nice and clear design, everything you need for a good game! Also pleases the system Donate.  10 \ 10 ... I advise"
18574,downright horrible
18575,"After many hours of play, the game are same as my last recension.
Why developer upgrade only skin of weapons,and don't work on a good anti cheat system.
Actually game are full of cheater,you may play only 1 or 2 good game  over 10 games. this is why i suggest to try other games,developer never focused working on cheat system.
And, if you are a cheater reading this,tell me:why you cheat on online fps game? for what? many kills? of course,kill 60-70 times and die only 5-6 are good,but remember,that's not you,thath a cheat.you have no balls to run game without cheat,because you know you are bad shooter.anyway f...you cheater.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Nice game but anticheat system not work. too many cheater ingame.some session are uplayable because full of cheater. 
So ok, im noob in fps game, but is simple to find how cheat and who use it.
sometimes game crashes  at the midlle of gaming,result you lost time and points.
Indeed, game is beautiful when you joiyng a session without cheater. weapon are balanced,and in this game you see ability of player.

After last update,some box released when you paly 1,5,10 times. but content are bad. evere time 1day weapon's,char.
So can we have probality to find lifetime box?i think is really little.

I suggest this game because is free-to-play, only for this."
18576,"Very Addictive and NOT a P2W. Easy to pick up mechanics, Come join the USMC on our Daily Custom North American Server!!!!!"
18577,"I have only played this game for a few minutes, but even with that short amount of time, it certainly exceeded my expectations of an FPS game."
18578,"Game is great for F2P, however, there are some annoying things with the game. How people spawn camp because the maps are so small. Or the fact that there is only one spawn placement so pretty much know where they are when you kill them or vice versa. it's great as it's not really P2W. Mostly cosmetics and if you want to spend money, you'd just be getting guns faster than people as the guns you can buy for money you can unlock with in-game currency with due time. Great game but due to the lack or larger maps and immersion, I just can't play it anymore. Even with friends as friend's aren't a big thing to the game."
18579,"Most everything is locked behind a paywall. Unpolished gunfight, maps, and gamemodes. Not P2W at least."
18580,"Fun, no bullshit, non-pay to win FPS. Plain and simple."
18581,gg GOOD GAME
18582,"Awsome game, super fast pase and never gets old. Played for ours at LAN party. Best played with friends in a private lobby."
18583,BEST GAME EVER
18584,When comparing this to other fps games black squad is like a cold plain bagel. Would be more entertaining to play volleyball with a hand grenade.
18585,"Pulled out the knife and right clicked my way into top spot in round leaderboards,  several times.

10/10 would stab again

"
18586,"
 As the headline claims B5 does indeed have excellent mechanics and good servers .  Im excited to see the evolution of this game as it looks visually impressive and brings innovative concepts to the genre ( which is tough to do ) .

  If you are a fan of [ Realistic ] FP- shooters and want something top-shelf that isnt too overwhelming , Squad has a lot to offer and i 100 % recommend the dl is surprisingly small for a game this robust .

  If shooters arent your thing you might still want to give a try , it is a unique experience with lots of variety and a good place for anyone looking to dabble in the genre due to its friendly community and accessible play structure 

 ~"
18587,Yea boy
18588,"as for a f2p mmofps - pretty good.

not pay to win

good enough graphics

solid playerbase. as for dec. 2017

variety of game modes

TAC RELOAD!

all and all - worth checking out atleast"

18593,I just played this game and loved it in an instant. This is a great FPS game!
18594,"this game is awesome :D when i download it i thought it's another version of cs:go and i won't play it unless 10 mins ...
but now i am playing the game for hours, daily ! xp

i recommend this game for all the shooters lovers (Not only cs:go lovers)

Note: i dont like cs:go but i like Black Squad :3"
18595,"Cool and construtive game!
Like warface but i think its better"
18596,"[h1]A pretty dang solid F2P FPS[/h1]
BlackSquad is [b]very solid[/b] FPS, probably indeed one of the best F2P shooters, if not THE best F2P shooter on the market just as it sells itself to be.
Gameplay is fast paced, with the short ttk and pacing of CoD/R6S and the non-regenerating HP and Gunplay(with the addition of ADS) of CSGO. Where all it takes its 1-2 shots to the head, or 3-4 shots to the body to kill.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*] Clunky and Quirky gunplay in a GOOD way. (You'll like this if you like CSGO, just way faster paced)
[*] Absolutely no Pay2Win. All guns can be permanently unlocked via ingame currency, [u][b]only cosmetics require actual $$$moolah$$$[/b][/u]
[*] All weapons are fairly well balanced, apart from the fact that a team can have 5 snipers with 0 drawbacks( all semi snipers 1 shot center mass)
[*] Fairly regular updates and events (Kudos to the Devs for giving us a chance to get free perm stuff from these! \(≧ᗨ≦ )/ )
[*] Team Balancing is currently pretty okay with the new system they've implemented
[/list]
[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*] The same old F2P FPS Lobby style, both system wise and UI wise. It's [b]Fairly Clunky[/b]
[*] A [u][b]Very Clunky[/b][/u] Party System, could be alot better
[*] [b]Ping.[/b] Currently high ping provides a very large advantage in gunfights. (つ﹏<。)
[*] The inability to do anything while you matchmake e.g Edit loadouts. Checking the store etc.
[*] DropRates for cosmetics are fairly terrible averaging roughly €400 before you get the ""best"" item in that particular lootbox
(I understand that cosmetics are their only ways of earning $$, but I think they'd be better off having the rates be better, which incentivises people to come back and spend more, instead of scaring them off with the terrible rates after they had dumped a large sum of cash on the lootboxes)
[*] Also Grenades and such cannot be permed...oddly enough, but guns can be permed! 
(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
[/list]
All in all, I'd give BlackSquad an 8.5/10 for a F2P FPS

18597,Best Free Game Ever.
18598,"its cool game some of my issue ( MINE!!! )

-1 Maps: the maps doesn`t have a lot of place to do somethings like hiding or something
-2 other things that game don`t include it and its the grenades like the flash or somethings like fire u know what i mean do u?

everything is cool but is their something to detect cheats?

( all of this thing is my own opinion and u don`t have the Rights to say any Bad words and of this game include all this thing i give it 100%"
18599,map design is the doo doo
18600,"to much arcade
not pay to win
good graphics
good gameplay."
18601,I'd like to say that this is a great shooter that is free-to-play and it is also very fun! Game gets regular updates which is nice but the map design in my opinion is so basic unlike other shooters out there (CS:GO). However I still recommend this game to others and can be a good time-pass when you're bored or not playing Call of Duty.
18602,"I just find this game bad, bland, boring, and unfair. Overall not my cup of tea..."
18603,Good game for a free game
18604,"best f2p fps game 
csgo+cod= BOOM
black squad

18605,"THIS IS A SUPER GREAT GAME I LIKE IT A LOT SO GO GET THIS GAME BOYS THIS IS 1 FREE 2 GREAT 3 GREAT 4 MORE GREAT 5 GREATEST 6 THIS IS THE SHIT 7 GET IT LOL

18607,This is for the people who loves first person shooting!!!!!!!!!
18608,very good game five stars
18609,<3 <3
18610,was fun the first few weeks then gets boring
18611,Its literally people rushing eachother and whoever gets the jump wins... boring
18612,"Amazing game with some best graphics, though it looks complicated, but actually very simple. Though theres a few gamemodes you can play, overall this game is fun and not pay to win!"
18613,"Just as good and generic as most $60USD FPS titles. However, this one is free."
18614,"very good and fun game, and it`s free :)"
18615,"I love this game it is now one of my favorite games to play on steam because it's free to play, has very fun gamemodes, and the supply drops are amazing. I highly recommend this game."
18616,cool game
18617,I played this game for  1500 hours  and has alot  of   memories with my  friends  but now this  game dead because of  cheators and develpers doing nothing about it to many players with aimbot and wallhacks and battle eye is kicking players 2 whose ping is high
18618,"Surprisingly, a really good game."
18619,"不错的娱乐游戏，开始还以为是和CF一样的坑钱产物，玩了才发现错怪他了
nice game to have fun, thought it would as bad as crossfire(CF), but its doesnt, no p2w in here, at least now"
18620,"NOICE can run on any old potato which most russians have (add me and lets play csgo, not this game)"
18621,nice game!!!
18622,"Sooo I have a few hours on this game and it really feels like its taking me back to my roots with F2P FPS's. I played Combat Arms from like 2008 till 2013 off and on and this game really makes me feel like its well put together. The only down side to this game right now is that because its so new the lack of maps can get super boring. All weapons are obtainable if you put some work in, and the DLC packs that are FREE give you an insane start to the game. Pretty much every weapon is in the DLC  packs so try them out then decied what weapon(s) you want to buy for perm!"
18623,yes this game is sick but when i am in a game it gliches when i have like a 100 or 98fps
18624,Very Nice.
18625,"Couldn't play because even though there was 10k players online, I was playing with bots! The bots had autoaim and when i decided to join a different game. It was filled with hackers. 
At the moment, until it's fixed I don't recommend it."
18626,"not bad, but shit"
18627,I can't play this game anymore... I keep getting the anti-cheat error which closes my game and I don't know why... I have tried to contact the support but they didn't answer...
18628,"BEST GAME EVER!!!
THIS GAME PUTS ALL OTHER GAMES TO SHAME.
IT IS JUST LIKE COD BUT FREE, AND BETTER THAN CS:GO.
THAT'S ALL I COULD TYPE RIGHT NOW, IF I HAD SOME MORE TIME I WOULD HAVE WRITTEN A ESSAY, BUT GOTTA PLAY BLACK SQUAD. 
SO BYE, GOOD LUCK"

18630,"1/ much Cheaters
2/ Players know ONLY CAMPING
3/ Every Map is same
4/ HitBox coded by an old american monkey
5/ Recoil of weapons is totally Random

just Close this game and come on in PyongYang for the real batlle"
18631,still some room for improvement in the menu for instance but overall it's a good game.

18633,"Great Game & Well balanced. any paid items don't give you any advantage over the person not paying(only gives you astetics eg. gun skin but same stats. Netcode is amazing, better than alotta AAA games! their a video analyses of the netcode of blacksquad on youtube if you wanna check it out for yourself.
Great game to add to your libary & playin rotation, i know plenty on people with alotta hours in-game who would agree with me to defantly recomend it! 

P.S: id tune out most of the people who will never be happy & will always find a way to bitch about the game in the comment section like if someone can come up with 25 nitpicking reasons, me nor anyone i know has ever ran into i wonder how many endless pages of complaints they could come up with for a game like cod, or even in the real world sience were all far from perfect if we being honest"
18634,"I enjoy this game, it just needs Australian severs, bring those in and you've got a regular player"
18635,this is a very nice game. It's a COD like game and i like it.
18636,"One of the most heavy rated  ""Top  Rated FPS Game's of 2017""


This game has been open to the kor  public for 2 years. & came to the world by storm  10/10 game play. 

""As for the negative  reviews"" 

These kids..... ----> They have no talent and should go play there   call of duty games like good little kids."
18637,High Ping but fun :D
18638,I wis there will be a esports community in the Philippines
18639,The game of hackers... why the fuck mostly ppls use cheats in this games lol?!
18640,Just wasn't fun.
18641,i couldn't even get into a match for fucks sake
18642,"I love this game 
Nice graphics 
Good strategy for play and awesome features 
More interesting when yoy play with friends"
18643,"u only can paly this game in peace mostly after update,then next couple of day,game become very stressfull due of cheater abuse this game. sad dev..not update anti cheat engine regular like others fps game..stupid game"
18644,Nice
18645,"The game is pretty solid. 
No P2W, Even weapons Etc.

But the lame part is that despite the weapon balance, assault rifles are the top choice. This mainly because of the grenade launchers attached to it. Allmost no one uses SMG's anymore.

Next up is the Team balance. team balance can be OK most of the times. but the Ping of most players... 
Fighting against 4 people with 300+ ping is nearly impossible because of the hitbox lagg. 

In general pretty good F2P game."
18646,"well reward sucks, from now on getting plain weapon skins are from grindy hell non-stop

ping are not kings anymore, everything lags

currency are nerfed and has been changed

i have been playing almost 2 years, im going back to CSGO"

18658,"For a free early access game it is pretty good. Movement mechanics are a bit off, but it’s still early in development. I’ll cut it some slack. Whole server thing is weird. It wants to you go into a server with higher ping for better matchmaking? Overall, it’s a step up from flash games, but hasn’t quite leaped into a full game yet. 7/10 for me. There’s better out there unless your computer is a potato."

18662,great game!
18663,"Very good and fun. Just need to add a report system, also a way to change my  name would be nice, I accedentaly picked wrong name"
18664,nice game
18665,Best FPS free-to-play game on steam. Love the mechanics and the graphics. though it is a very low chance to get skins for guns but the rest is aite.
18666,"Decent shooter. I'd say if Call of Duty and CS:GO were to make a child this is it. So far its a promising shooter, seemed fluid, the tutorial was immersive right off the bat so hopefully the devs dont fall asleep on it like others do and we gamers could have a good title on our hands, and best is iits FREE!"
18667,"After 10 hours of playing this game, it seems to be alright, especialy for a FTP game"
18668,Very nice game considering that it is free. Very fast paced and addicting.
18669,"Not at all terrible. Feedback from guns / kills is a bit much (better too much than too little on that TBH). Netcode isn't terrible. Weapon unlocks seem a bit uphill, in the sense that based on what I was earning with 1st and 2nd place in DM it would have taken about 100 +/- matches to unlock a new gun. Cash shop doesn't SEEM crazy, uses some minimally trashy tactics (character costs $13 in currency to make sure you invest $15 etc). Matches are fun, but with how small the maps are they seem way to long. The system for inviting friends to matches is cryptic AF (have to be in a lobby and use messenger to add them), but that's a fairly minor gripe.

If you haven't tried it and you're interested *at all* just DL it and check it out. It's not going in my normal game rotation, but it might go in yours."
18670,Best game ever.
18671,"this game is so riddled with hackers it is crazy. wall hack, esp, aimbots, mass damage.
would be a great game but playing against so many hackers you have zero chance at getting anywhere."
18672,"For FPS lovers. 

The game has lot more to offer depends on your playstyle.

Cool events, Cool weapons, Cool characters."
18673,Good Good
18674,thje best gmai ever played!!
18675,better than CS:GO
18676,Black Squad is like a quick-paced version of Black Ops or any shooting game on a console which is pretty great. I would recommend this for the people who love shooting games online.
18677,This game is ok
18678,"I'm amazed at the length of time spent in 'the recruitment arc' - it's a lengthy process to join a clan.

We played one round and were in!

You can't argue with their ability to spot great talent."
18679,"Where a Call of Duty/CS:GO crossover could've done so well, this game fails. I do play it frequently, but what they've done here is meshed parts of games that just don't work. Weapons can scope - but only with the scope that comes attached. Not that scoping is genuinely important, as it's plausible to get headshots by accident unzoomed from across a map. Speaking of maps, they're cluttered and small. While in a small setting one would expect close quarters, active combat; this is not at all what is delivered. The clutter makes it hard to get around - except for in a situation that requires sniping. More often then not, people will sit in their own spawn zoomed in on an area that a player from the other team would emerge right after invincibility runs out. Ah yes, spawn invincibility. While this isn't present in game modes that offer 1 life (duh), it is obviously active in others. I understand the concept of invulnerability, its the same in every game - prevent spawn killing on teams already being wiped. Sure, but this lasts too long on such small maps. When a map already has no room for movement, the moment someone emerges from the spawn you're in their view - and you guessed it - he or she is still fully invincible. Grenade launchers are rampant and don't really work properly(functioning essentially as just extra thrown grenades). While it most certainly isn't P2W (which is the biggest UP this game can get), the idea of having a nice knife/gun skin is more farfetched than on CS:GO. Chests offer a 1% chance at recieving an item, and the paid chests offer no better luck than chests bought with in-game currency. That's my biggest gripe - for this reason - The company will lose revenue in every aspect or have to go paid subcription if they keep the store the way it is. Nobody will pay for the ability to open chests if the chests offer no reward. The game also offers no real competitive side to alleviate the ridiculousness of playing with confused people who have no real grasp of aiming. There are clan wars, but it isn't taken seriously nor should it be. The small assortment of maps, broken shop, nonexistent competitive play, and lack of players with any real understanding are just a few of the things that make this game fall flat overall."
18680,laggy as hell lot of aimbots trash company. still no change still shooting through wall and aimbot. 10/10 devs dont even try
18681,this game is really awesome
18682,amazing game and free
18683,"Great game, with no pay to win aspects!"
18684,"Best F2P shooter i've played yet. There is no pay to win, although higher tier weapons do more damage than others, and can be bought with real $$$, they are unlockable by simply playing a day or two of quite layed back deathmatches. Mechanics and gameplay are solid, can't really complain about anything."
18685,This is such a good game just the only thing it needs it’s that you can customize the guns and that’s all
18686,"Black Squad is a mixture of two popular shooters, this is CS: GO and Call of Duty. I liked the game: balance is present, donat small, you can play without it. community, for me even better than in CS. so you can create a party. fun game 9/10"
18687,Greatly made really fun!
18688,free to play giving good content and nice mechanix
18689,"I've played a lot of these types of games (AVA for example), but none of them have achieved the level of fun that Black Squad does (in my opinion). Adding the fact that this is game is not a pay-to-win game (like AVA and CSGO), it just makes this game all that better. Granted the graphics aren't the best, but who cares about graphics if the game is good? Long story short, get this game, you will have fun if you are an FPS type guy/girl (2017 cant assume genders). Cheers guys!"
18690,k.nice.uzuzuzuweeieasjufiefosass
18691,"Pros:
1. The performance is amazing, i have played it both on a 2017 gaming pc and on  a potato. Both ran perfectly on low and even high settings.
2. There isn't much Pay2Win in this game but there are some things that just suck
3.  I must say, the skin and currency system is built nicely, and the bullets are relatively cheap.
the skins and guns are mostly original
4.While not having much Quick Play modes, it has a lot of custom gamemodes which i enjoy playing
5. The free DLC for the game is not bad, and i think it could be helpful for new players to choose whether they want to buy a gun or not.
Cons:
1. Pay2Win exist, but not much of it. (i'm not counting the 200,000 gold you get from the start since i spent it all on cases) You can get a gun (for example, an ak47) after you've played the game for long enough, but a rich person could buy it before they even get into their first match.
2. The shop is pure @#*&. When i saw the shop, i instanty thought ""Wait, did I launch Warface?""
Buying grenades is not a good idea. Having weapons that you can use only for a limited time would only pass of as a bad joke.
3. While not a really bad mistake, the english translation needs some work.
Overall, i liked the game, but it has things you should change. This is Early Access, so you have enough time to fix this. I didn't play the game for very long, but i doubt anything will change except my loadout.

If i had the opportunity to rate it out of 10, i would rate it 7.5/10.


Edit:There is a bug(At least for me) that after a match the Random Box menu will not be openable. No matter if i had enough bullets or coins. 
 
Also some ways you can fix the bad parts of the game.

1. (Problem - Pay2Win exist, but not much of it. (i'm not counting the 200,000 gold you get from the start since i spent it all on cases) You can get a gun (for example, an ak47) after you've played the game for long enough, but a rich person could buy it before they even get into their first match.) 
Fix - I'd say add a ""Unlock Weapons Before You Can Use Them"" feature. It could really make the game more friendly for new players. Oh, and also make some kind of skill level separation. 

2. (Problem - The shop is pure @#*&. When i saw the shop, i instanty thought ""Wait, did I launch Warface?""
Buying grenades is not a good idea. Having weapons that you can use only for a limited time would only pass of as a bad joke.) 
Fix - Just scrap the shop in this game completely and make it (As said above) ""Unlock A Weapon To Use It""

3. (Problem - 3. While not a really bad mistake, the english translation needs some work.) 
Fix - No comment.

Edit 2: 

I thought of some ideas that really could make the game more community-friendly.

1. Workshop integration. A good idea would be to make the Workshop like in CS:GO. (Custom maps that can be downloaded for free and skins that can be voted if people want them in-game)

2. Now, the UI is a bit confusing and i recommend you change it. Make it simple, with the shop, medal shop and case shop in the same section, Custom and Quick Play in  the same list (Kind of like in Battlefield 4).

3. While it would be expensive, a companion mobile app would make the game better. Being able to buy skins or guns while you're not near your computer is a pretty good idea.

4. While not being the best idea, being able to sell skins on Steam would be interesting. Although this may bring up gambling sites, then other stuff like that, and the game would be in the same situation as CS:GO, where skins would be more expensive as a new phone."
18692,goood game i love it
18693,Fake csgo
18694,...ok
18695,"HEY ADMIN...ITS GREAT EFFORT FOR THIS AWESOME GAME....ONLY 2 SUGGESTIONS...HOW TO TURN OFF RADIO MESSAGES (Z,X AND C COMMANDS)??? AS SOME PLAYERS JUST SPAM THESE MESSAGES LIKE == MOVE FORWARD ETC.....AND ALSO SOLVE THE HIGH PING ISSUES."
18696,"In a game made in the Source Engine and has people constantly rushing you for kills as well as the usual absurd amount of snipers, I wouldn't recommend this game. Yes, it says it's not pay to win, I didn't look too far into it, however, I did play one match. In that match I found out, my sprint is bound to scroll down, no toggle crouch, and no voice communication. I looked to rebind these keys, but all I found was the keys to change my sensitivity. Which, to be fair, is a good idea, but in times to communicate it doesn't help. The game has potential to be fun, maybe with a party, but not alone.

It also gives off a CS:GO vibe to which is not for me."
18697,Tac reload simulator 2017.
18698,Best f2p fps ever.
18699,"Very nice, a good shooting game."
18700,CSGO and Warface had a child and hence Black Squad was born.
18701,At first I didn't believe it's not p2w game which is free to play but it turned out just the opposite. It's fast pased FPS and it's pretty enjoyable.
18702,"Can be fun to play, but spawn protection lasts way too long, enemy spawns can be seen from too many angles on all maps.
have to constantly keep paying for grenades to keep them, otherwise you lose your grenades. next to no bullet penetration on any item as far as I can see."
18703,"Jogo Muito Bom.
Recomendo Demais."
18704,good
18705,Good Game
18706,"A fun game,surely not a game for noob gamers."
18707,good
18708,Basically dead
18709,Awesome game! I love it! One of ny Favorite Games!
18710,definitly has gotten better since eirly access so give it a whirl the server pings are spiky at times but other then that DECENT
18711,"This game is a fast pace FPS(first person shooter) game.this game is still in early development and it is very good considering it is a game still in its early stages.Although I recommend to check your bindings first as it might be uncomfortable for some people.normally if I were you,I would go for the shot guns since the maps are very small"
18712,"I find this game very fun for a F2P shooter. There is a lot of grinding involved but it's actually not that terrible because it's just normal gameplay. You could put out some real money on this game but it's not really P2W because anyone can get the weapon it just takes time to get the medal needed. If you like Counter Strike you should try this game out. I find it more fun than Warface, mostly because it's more PvP based. 

Note to reader: When you start the game, you'll have enough credits to buy one weapon from the shop (gold). Don't buy any weapon with a low stability. Weapons like the HNK417 are really janky because of low stability so it makes getting kills a chore. Buy something like the R5 GL or any weapon with a stability above 70. Try to balance it between power and stability."
18713,"It uses the default controls and code provided with U3 with seemingly very few changes. While U3 is a good ground work it's not supposed to be a full game. 
"
18714,Great game if you're too much of a cheap ass to get CS:GO. Crouching could be elliminated or timed for at least every thirty seconds so when you go to aim people aren't avoidijng death as they kill you. And Claymores could be completely eradicated as it's basically a go to weapon for laziness
18715,"Ik i have low hours on this game but my first impression is that it's a good game, feels similar to CSGO but holy shit the grenade spam is real lmao. The downside is the settings for the controls is below average and my FPS keeps dropping to 30 ish even tho im running a GTX 1060 with i7-6700HQ and 16GB RAM. But it's a early access game and it's still in development so yeah i get it. Hopefully they'll fix that soon. Overall it's a good game, recommended if you want a alternative to CSGO, Battlefield or COD lol"
18716,THIS GAME IS RACIST!!!!!!
18717,"Jeezus fuckking christ, this game has alot of hack users.... never have I encountered 3 hack users having the most ridiculous scores in a destruction game. even in cover i get killed, bullets magically go through layers of boxes. at least the uninstall button works, thank god for that."
18718,"Black Squad is basically a more tactical CSGO. Best thing is, its free.

Pros:
1) ITS FREE
2) The graphics are really good 
3) Unless you have a toaster, the FPS should be decen (Im using a GTX 960M)
4) The gamemodes are very fun, especially the 5v5 Demolition mode

Cons;
1)Its still early on, so there might be some bugs


Overall, 8/10 i recommend. i think it still requires a little more content to make sure the players have enough things to do, because although gamemodes are fun, but it might get boring/ repetitive after a while. But other than that, Black Squad is on the right track to being a great game."
18719,Nice !
18720,not bad for free game!!! nice
18721,pretty bad /
18722,"Hmmmm, for some reason this game reminds me of Tactical Intervention and CSN: Zombies. I wonder why... OH RIGHT! Because they're all shit!"
18723,If you like CS GO you will like this game. It is addictive.
18724,"Crashed while trying to change sound settings.

10/10 earf*ck"
18725,"Pretty cool game.
Its really like CS:GO but a lot ( i mean A LOT ) better than it!"
18726,It's a simple Shooter game like CS:GO. Good graphics and no pay 2 win. Each day you'll get gold and medals after some matches and each 7 days. Skins are the only paid thing in this game for weapon or charakter.
18727,Very nice game! Keep up! :)
18728,"One of the best FPS Free-to-play games for sure. It's like a mix between Call of duty and Counter-strike, fast paced and good modes (My favorite is 5v5 demolition, probably more to come). If you Like or love FPS, This is a MUST.

18731,"the game is good and enjoyable. but, nowadays there are so many hackers using wallhacks, aimbots, and speedhack.. i hope steam support will solve this problem. otherwise this game will loss more players. 
"
18732,"5 thing you will like about this game:
- Average system requirements, computato friendly. You dont need a NASA PC to play this 200-fps-locked game.
- Various & well-balanced weapon system. Free access (with much effort, ofc) to all weapons. No pay2win.
- Many missions, events with generous prizes.
- Easy to play, fast-paced action.
- Plenty of support dlc.
5 things you will dislike about this game:
- Lack of in-game comunnication since there is no voice chat.
- Matchmaking sux.
- No vote kick/report system. If you got a cheater in game, pray that he is disconnected or just disconnect yourself.
- Only few game modes.
- Lag!!!

18744,Good game. Maps could be bigger and there are too many greande launchers. Gun customization could be better and bigger.
18745,"The damage is so inconsisent it makes the game awful, if they fixed the dmg it would be top tier, 5/10"
18746,Small cluttered forgettable maps ruin what would otherwise be a great game.

- easy progression

Cons:
- uninspired differences in guns of the same type
- few game modes
- short matches
- no way to spectate / review kills
- lots of cheaters
- no way of reporting people from a match
- lots of hackers
- no way of blacklisting people you wish to not play with again
- lots of aimboters
- no way to filter players / matches by region
- lots of wallhackers

other then that the game is great"

E de 20 caixas que abri ganhei  apenas 25 medalhas e no final de todas essas caixas oque 250 medalhas compra ?

NADA ATÉ A ARMA MAIS MERDA É 1500 E AS MAIS DESCENTES SÃO 2500. E as recompensas que ganhamos por jogar e talz é extremamente lenta neste jogo vale mais a pena só entrando e se logando para pegar recompensas diarias do que jogando."

18780,"Black Squad is a solid Free2Play Shooter, with some good features and no Pay2Win involved. 

Pros:
- No Pay2Win.
- Ranked games included
- 3 Sets of equipment that u can choose on every Roundstart.
- Many Settinngs to mess around with.
- Your PC should be able to run it, if u are not playing on a Potato.
- No overpowered stuff.
- The Gunplay feels Good
- Nice Seasonal events with Custom Maps/Gamemodes
- Active Community / Community Managers.
- Ironsights/Aimpoints on every Gun
- Easy to learn but Hard to Master
- Costom Game Rooms
- Dead Players spectate on First Person
- Guns are not expensive to Buy
- Free DLC's for new Players to test out most Guns befor they have to buy them.
- A Box for Ingame currency where u can get Knifeskins from.
- Soundplay works perfectly in this game.
- U can mount a silencer on nearly every Weapon ingame, exept some pistols and all 
  Snipers.
- Crouchspamming is fixed (u will slow down while spamming)

Cons:
- To many Grenade Launchers.
- Some maps are really confusing for beginners.
- Clan Emblems only as a reward.
- Confusing UI if u launch the first time.
- No Gun Custimisation. (espacially for Scopes/Iron sights)
- To big Viewmodels of the Gun ( but thats my personal opinion)
- A Big Hacker wave ruining the Competative scene ATM

All in all a Good Free2Play shooter. It is a good mix Shooter with Features from ""Counter Strike"", ""Call of Duty"" and alike.
The stuff u have to Pay for will not make u Win easy, but will bring u some Shiny Skins or a nice EXP/Gold Boost.
The Classic Gamemode ""Search and Destroy"" aka. ""Demolition"" is really fun and works well in a 5v5 Clanwar/ Competative Match.
Funmodes Like, Mellee only, Sniper only, Battlematch, Assasination and alike will help u, if u are tired of 5v5 S&D.


Love this Game 
I would rate it a solid 9/11.

*Edits:
- Deleted some Cons that got patched.
- Changed some words for understanding reasons.
- Added the Missing Steam achievments on the Con list.
- Missing Steam achievments are fixed now.
- Added rankeds to Pro and the SMG buff to Cons.
- Edited nearly everything 'cause the game changed a bit."

18782,"THE BEST F2P YOU'LL FIND IN THE WHOLE COMMUNITY! Well, according to my opinion that is! You'll never know unless you try out. Black Squad (BS) is a Free To Play game for all FPS lovers out there! For me it is a next generation Free To Play game. I know some prefers CS:GO or Other Famous FPS games so I respect that. You do not need to pay real money to have weapons or skins since the BS already gives you most of the weapons for free! This is why I recommend this game! TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELVES!!... :D

1 downfall, Updates takes 24 hours before finishing. So plz fix this. And plz add voice chat and mute system on Black Squad thank you!! 


--- 08/27/18 ---
Please fix the Auto Team Balance! I already experienced a lot of issues about it, for example when I enter a sniper survival mode the enemy team's ranks are major, captains, etc. mostly silvers and my teammates are all dogtags, and sergeants. Is that even fair? And the matchmaking too..please don't let the players join a match thats already on going, even though their lacking players. Its kinda unfair if you join a game and the only rounds left are two and you joined the losing team like 6-3 out of 8. Its just too unfair. Please fix this.

The new sniper rifle: G28E, WAYYY TOOO OP pls fix



*FROM THIS WAY  ON I WILL EDIT MY  REVIEW ABOUT  THE GAME*

First,  Useless  Auto Team  Balance System.
Second, Ignorance  Among   The  Players  By  Ruining  The  FPS  (Updates  Ruins The  Frames  You Know?!  we have reported  that many many many times now!!  Still  no fix after 6  months and still going on with  the updates?! curse  you all! Dev's becoming more  and m ore lazier.  At first,  I thought this game  was  awesome and so interactive. But  I was  wrong...after  a long time of playing the game...I  loved  how it  was.. I loved the  frames  I get  before..  I had like  almost 200  FPS  when I tried the game for the  first  time...But now?! guess  what..most of   us gets less that   60  FPS  now!! and you  just kept  the updates  without  optimizing the gaming experience for budget gamers!)  I only  the game  would be the same as it  was...optimized,  balanced,  awesome, interactive..but no, it isn't anymore.  And even thought I  edited  this review..I am still sure  none of  you will read it.   Nor try to fix the game. Hate me  all  you  want  I don't care  anymore. F to the mods. :>"
18783,"I like the game mechanics but if u could allow 1 vs 1 battle ,  it will greatly improve the game"
18784,"no future, will die out slowly, i liked to play it but devs dont care."
18785,Not a bad free-b fps only thing i don't like are the maps
18786,"Fuck this shit. Ping is stuck at 988. We can't even communicate with the Management in this game. Globe ISP, Philippines. Fix our server cause time will come this game will sucks even with good graphics. just saying."
18787,Worse balancing than the first few days on Team Fortress 2's Meet Your Match update.
18788,"HOW THE hell do you play clan and learn more!?!? im stuck with deathmatch quick p[lay.. i wana do the real stuff but have no idea how yet... all the cool COD features finally in a CS type game play...
"
18789,this game sucks
18790,"It's a good game. Its F2P, and its just geniuine fun for when you're bored of vsing smurfs and hackers and dealing with shitty teammates on CSGO. It really does remind me of CoD, as it is run and gun, but demolition gives that CSGO feel. Its a really nice blend of them both, and i highly reccomend for any casual gamer, or any gamer who's just bored and wants something to play. There are lots of weapons to chose from, not too much grinding necessary and a not-so-great laptop like mine can run it.

It's a good game."
18791,"Dead game.
Stupid recoil mechanic. Why does the gun stop recoiling upwards after a few shots? It just strafes left-right-left-right afterwards.

Still better than CS:NO."
18792,".
"
18793,"Buy Counter-Strike, not this."
18794,"Edited my review.

This game is ok but It gets boring after a while and you can die extremely easily but it's fun when you're bored. The only thing I don't like is similar to Counter Strike: Nexon Zombies (not a good game) there are stupid looking schoolgirl/anime looking girl characters that don't fit at all to what the gameplay is about but I think that it's because the developers are Korean, also like Counter Strike: Nexon Zombies.

I would give it a 5/10."
18795,THE LAGG
18796,really good game D:
18797,Nice game :)
18798,"It's a okay game needs more modes and maybe a zombie mode. Update the UI and update tick from 30 to atleast 60. 

I wouldn't say its pay2win but there should be a way to earn skins even if it takes alot longer."
18799,"I love this game, the game always have updates, and it's more and more goody!! Awesome game.

My only one question is only, i play this game lot of times and i why don't have Welcome Fortune Box in my DLC Inbox? :/

Thanks for Support, Ingame name: Clinkzes"
18800,"waste of fuckin time :(
"
18801,"One of the best f2p games out there, if not THE BEST
Sure, you get pissed all the time, but there is a feeling to it
Just play some Sabaton in the background, and you'll feel like you are in a war. 
"
18802,"This game tends to be fun at the beginning, the gamemodes that you're given to play are fun, but can get very bland very quick. 
It's a [b] Play-To-Win Free-To-Play Game [/b], that's what most companies do today.
Don't need to spend money to get items, you'll eventually acquire them later on in the game."
18803,"I don't play a lot of shooters. Black Squad is your typical lobby shooter. You goto quick match, choose team death match and there you go. I didn't play any of the other modes so I can't comment on them. What I did play, I honestly didn't enjoy. Guns, at least at first, are affordable but the net code is bad. I found myself getting shot from around a corner at times even with my ping saying 40 ms. Things like that did not happen to me in BlackLight Retribution or Warface.

The tutorial is minimal. There are also some things that look like cover but do not stop bullets. You can be shot through them. It makes sense as they're flimsy wooden boxes but it took me a few deaths to really learn which ones they are.

Then there are the maps. The majority of the maps turn into massive spawn camping fests as the TDM's last about 150 kills. There is only a handful of spawn points, usually 2 for your team that are both easily camped with the, I believe it's 8 v 8 matches. There is also a bit of balancing in TDM with some of the guns. The sniper rifles for example, at least the M10 is pretty much a 1 shot from full HP no matter where you're hit. You also don't have the options  of classes in TDM, at least not from what i've noticed. That means no strategic planning like claymore mines or the like when in a normal match.

All in all, I think Warface does it better than this game. The netcode is shoddy and honestly the gunplay just isnt' fun. It seems like it takes a billion bullets for me to kill anyone with an SMG while 2-3 bullets from a rifle pretty much ends me instantly. I've already uninstalled but don't really plan on picking it up again."
18804,it sucks so bad
18805,"Very fast pace, super fun to play with friends. 
Thumbs up"
18806,I really enjoy this game. As i do not own a gaming computer this game works very well.
18807,"nice
"
18808,"Ghost in the Shell Online died, so I migrated to Dirty Bomb, it died too, so I tried Iron Sights, didn't like it. Black Squad kinda hits the mark for me. Reminds me of A.V.A in terms of movement, recoil, gamemodes and weapon variety. 

Has a unique game mode which has BF conquest like objectives on the map and CoD like kill streak skills and classes. These classes and skills only work on this mode and the PvE mode though. TDM, Demo doesn't have them.

Graphics are a bit old but I don't mind it. It looks on par with A.V.A or CS:GO on mid settings.

There are lootboxes and keys in this game, but don't worry, there are permanent weapons and skins that you can acquire without paying anything. If you want you can get weapon skins very cheaply in Communty Market, much like CS:GO. The only items which are always timed are grenades.

Variety of weapons, game modes and competitive keeps me returning. Shooting feels good, movement feels good, game rewards me for my effort and success, so I like it overall. It's not the perfect tac-shooter I've been looking for, that spot beloned to GitS Online, R6 Siege is really good but it doesn't play like anything in it's genre. So Black Squad seem to be a really good alternative for dead GitS Online may it RIP."
18809,"Free to play
No pay to win
Fast Paced 
Ive rarely seen a hacker 
Pretty good game overall"
18810,ok f2p game
18811,A very average but fun free to play shooter that does many things right with a couple of flaws in its free to play model
18812,Great Game
18813,"Nice FPS game, love to play CS:GO and this game"
18814,A very good game with dedicated severs
18815,goog

18818,hacker play ingame [RAM] i need baned him
18819,GOODGAME
18820,"Black Squad is a mix of CS:GO and Rainbow Six: Vegas. Its non-stop action that can be as tense as it is quick. It abandons realistic bullet physics for an arcade F2P FPS that is very addictive, with full casual and competitive support."
18821,The game's user interface needs improvements. I opened the game and it was kinda a bit off a turn off due to the UI but I ended up playing it everyday which is a good thing I guess :D
18822,"Games decent. Just need some Aussie servers and I will be very happy.
Not to bad for a ""Free"" FPS."
18823,I love this game
18824,"its a good game and fun, we can paly with freinds"
18825,"Well, first of all this game is a giant blend between *inhales*, CS:GO, Battlefield, COD and RSS. *exhales*. The best thing about this game that it has the elements of the above stated games but hey it's completely free! The only drawback that this game is kinda Pay-To-Win, you either gotta grind a ton or spend a ton. [Trash community tho.]"
18826,"The game is so good actually more like combat army and counter strike coming together in one game, definitely enjoying my time with my friends"
18827,good free fps game. i haven't plaed much of it lately but it definetly is good. try it.
18828,"Once you go black,you never come back."
18829,awesome game! i would recomend! realy relaxing and fun to play!
18830,so nice like counter strike
18831,"Pretty cool game. 9/10
Please remove the administrator prompt because im not an admin on my PC and have to launch steam as a admin to play
also you should think about that launcher whether to remove it or naw. idk"
18832,"I am already a huge fan of this game. If you loved the days when Ravenshield, pre athena sword and  Counter strike rulled the roost then this is the game for you. A ton of different game modes, fast paced action and smooth running graphics. The game play is great fun and i am fricken loving it. I have been so disappointed in the FPS series of the last 7 to 8 years, Yeah you know the ones. C.O.D and the BF series. Then give this one a go. These guys are getting it right and it is about time someone did.

Two suggestions for the developers. 
1st. We need a hardcore mode, No rets and high contact hit detection
2nd. Limit the bunny hopping

9.5.out 10 guys , great job"
18833,"A free-to-play FPS that's actually not pay to win (yet xd)

I recommend this game if you're bored with CSGO or CoD.

Either way it's still pretty fun to play."
18834,This is a great  FPS game for free and I highly recomend it.
18835,Awsome game!!!
18836,"not p2w, plenty of game modes(they even have a budget cs:go mode) and all the guns are balanced.
also great graphics, even with onboard laptop graphic processor."
18837,More than you might expect from a F2P game. No pay wall either which is great.
18838,i love gam so muc it moistens my cervixs flaps!
18839,A great F2P FPS game... and the great part is you can even play it on potato PC xD hoping for more in future
18840,"The anti-cheat system in this game is so advanced that you cant play this game even if ur not using any cheating softwares. 10/10 to this anti-cheat system.

20/12/17:
Game working without any errors."
18841,"Wow this game is cool, the graphics is lit."
18842,"great game! very fun and challenging. pretty much CSGO, but its free, i recommend downloading it"
18843,This game graphic is nice and its free...soo download it now...ITS FREE GUYS...FREE!!!!!
18844,best free fps here!!!
18845,"game super played 17 hours. There are almost no chiters, Donat does not affect the game for this respect to the developers;) but only a little weapons, I suggest adding from the sniper rifles ""Steyr Scout"", ""СВУ-АС"", ""ax-308"" and ""T-5000"" because I'm a sniper, and there's almost no weapons. If you add at least one, I'll be very glad"
18846,"Fun and free. Just stay away from lottery micro transactions 'cause your chances are very, very low get the skins of your dream.  Custom weapons work great anyways. Most of the non-skins weapons are availiable with in game golds and medals. Great clans features. Populated servers from 8 to 16 players. Non-stop action. Anti-cheat by BattleEye (a good one) but still few cheaters out there.  I came across  2 in 3 weeks of playing the game. They have been reported in forums. For an early access game I must say that it's a pretty well accomplished game already. No major fixes required. No bugs. Joining a game is fast. Servers very well populated. Average 8,000 players daily.

Overall, this isn't Arma's  war simulation game. Just a fast action shooters game, and it's does very well what it supposed to be.

7.8/10

P.S. Achievements don't work at the moment."
18847,really nice game      but the guns are a little expensiveeeee
18848,good game
18849,Like bro ;)
18850,"-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Access - 27. November 2017
:
[68/100 Points]
If you want a free to play game then take this. I really had fun playing it although it takes very long to unlock new weapons but regard: It's for free. I wouldn't really call it a pay to win game because the expensive weapons aren't overpowered. The game is something between CS and CoD.

18852,"Servers take too long to join and ranking up in this game is a bitch. The games free though so at least I got that going for me,"
18853,The BEst !
18854,Good game but need anti cheat system coz lot of hackers!
18855,Lots of bugs since beta. But so far so good through gameplay
18856,The best f2p game on the market. Buy the dlc to support devs.
18857,Not Bad
18858,"[Call of Duty + Counter-Strike = Black Squad]

Gameplay is smooth, graphics are nice, most of the maps are fine.

Has microtransactions that typical asian first person shooters have, but nothing here is pay to win.

At first I thought this was going to be another generic free to play first person shooter, but Black Squad was above my expectations. It gets fun once you get to know the mechanics and the map layouts.

(By the way, if you want the best guns, buy either the AK-47, AK-12 or SR-47. These are harder to control than other weapons, but really rewarding.)"
18859,"Super fun. I just recently started getting into fps games, and for one that was free...well, I didn't know what to expect. Really loving it though!"
18860,Such awesome free to play games much wow !! Some hackers abuse it still it is much more fun to play
18861,"great game, finally a simple small map easy to get goin no bullshit fps"
18862,Not worth it my time after the patch they do Australian cant even play anymore the lag is so real why oh why before australian can play in southeast asian server now imposible thanks im quit
18863,"I think it's an excellent game irrespective of the fact it's free. It's a cross between CS and COD with a nice range of play modes, nice maps & decent graphics. The play modes and weapons are similar to CS and the entertaining reward system is similiar to COD. The fact it's not pay 2 win is also something I strongly support in principal. 

It's great for a couple of quick matches when you don't have much time or in my case, when you need a break from overdosing on CS.

I'm glad I tried it and it's a keeper!"
18864,"Take Wolfteam.
Remove armour, wolves, and the ELWRCI

Now you have Black Squad. 


It[b] feels	[/b]like a F2P shooter, but without the Pay-to-win. It has a large competitive influence in Asia due to the balance of the game. Permanent weapons are easy to get and you can choose between a vast variety of permanent weapons based off the gold (currency) you get from logging in. There is abilities, but most people use flak jacket which is just armour. It is balanced because you are missing out on an ability slot which can be used for zoning or killing pretty well.

TL:DR : Great, balanced, competitive, not pay-to-win competitive shooter"
18865,It's janky but fun
18866,Nope. Pay to win. #ripoff
18867,"This game is extremely satasfying, when you hit someone it feels like you've hit them."
18868,"“Tac- Reload” 
Black Squad is a fast and fun shooter without any “Pay-to-win”
features currently. This game is still early access, but has very good potential. Especially for the price.

Pros-
Free to play
Not pay to win 
Hacking community is small
Servers attempt to give you a lag free experience. You still have those players that should be on another server closer to them, but choose to lag in your game anyway.
Daily/ weekly login cash/ medals and bonus money if you play 10 hours
So far, very few toxic people in the community 
Free DLC content. You can try almost every gun in the game for free

Cons-
Stability issues. Server disconnects still happen.
Not a very big streaming community. Not that this is a real con. It is growing slowly.
No Moderators in game. At least I haven’t seen any on the NA server.
No active GM’s checking on servers in game and feedback in real time of players 
Hit registry can be random as hell at times. (This has been better after a few updates)
Friend list gets in the way at times
High store prices

Other Thoughts
There should lag penalty to players 150ms+ ping time.  Anyone over 150ms should not be on a server with players of a much lower ping time. We know it is recommended to connect to a server close to you, but a lot of players do not. 
You do spend real money to buy bullets. Bullets are the games currency. So, if you want to buy a crate for a chance to own a fancy weapon, you will need to spend money for it.

18894,This game is really fun and a bit addicting despite the constant lag as I live in Australia and experiencing 200+ ping is not always fun lol
18895,Best FPS game of the year~!
18896,10/10 fun fps game

18898,"Great game, especially for being free! You'll find yourself at the edge of your seat as you fight for your life and team against another. With a price like this, you can't really complain... Unless of course your a millionaire! And if that's the case please send me money. Need games. ;)"
18899,"Very good game, very balanced and it's free, plus you can run it on any pc definitely worth checking out!"
18900,"It's a really good game with perfect hitbox, good competive maps, lot of updates, skins but if wont starts on ESL its will die ...
(Everybody hope will start soon)"
18901,"Amazing FPS despite the fact a lot of cheaters are around. The devs are trying hard to fight them off... and I hope that is going to get better. This game is fast, raging as much as it can be fun. It s a free game which I would always play. The money is not a must in it as the weapons can be acquired easily with DLC to try and then medals or gold. The payers there do it only for customisation of it s avatar or guns... great game despite some lags and as well some ping problems if you are not playing in a server near your location.

update, the cheaters are less and less and battle eye did a great job on this. Still there are some and will be always but that is now more likely to be playable. 

Cheaters are not always cheaters too!! some players have skills and are really good. I am not bad myself but to be honest, I still am amazed by the skills of some other players and I know for sure they are not cheating.

So to say, practice, learn, try, test, shout and don t give up and then this game is just an amazing strategy game and even if you are good, all depends of the team you are with and the team you play against."

18911,Best FPS game!
18912,good game but sometimes cant understand u shoot at the enemy with sniper and sometimes dont hit likek u dont need to move a mili secs but good game
18913,"For being a free game, it offers quite good content. Many maps, different gamemodes, the weapons are lovely even if as usual snipers and AKs rule above everything else.
Do not expect this game to be like CS, even if the bomb mode is quite the same, the gameplay itself differs a bunch. There isn't a big community and it lacks a lot of clan related gameplay, making it little competitive.

I have yet to understand why switching to your knife makes the player run faster. IT'S DANGEROUS TO RUN WITH A SHARP OBJECT IN HAND!

7/10 game worth to play when bored for some random quick matches."
18914,This is  quite a good game to spend some time

Oh yeah this is a GOOD game, fun to play and it's balanced absolutely NOT pay to win!

Just a small thing, i know this is still early access but maybe have better/closer servers in the future!

18928,"Like this game, amazing."
18929,"Im honeslty shocked im giving this a thumbs down, but there are reasons people. I have played 25 hours into the game which isn't much, but for an fps you can get an impression of the game, to give some of your opinons.

Maps - are just to small, you will either get spawn killed by the enemy or will do the spawn killing yourself, which is frowned upon by me, even if my team is spawn camping personally wouldn't myself as i hate to be spawn kill. 

Hacks - now there are uneducated players that think hackers are fiction lawls and make themselves look stupid when they say there are non. I consider myself to be a intermediate skill level with 1.5 kd and have been playing games were you can just tell they are using some hack either ( wall cham, color aimbot, or some no-recoil macro with some mouses or autohotkey )....people its not as hard as you think to use a hack.

Now, if you don't care about getting spawn killed on some maps and encounter hackers every so often then atleast give this game a try, but hackers ruined this game for me and had to uninstall it...untill they fix this issue won't be playing it anymore.

18930,"This game surprised me on how similar it is to the old school call of duty games. The graphics are simple and well done and the gameplay is smooth and nicely paced.

18941,"Great free to play FPS game. Players who end up purchasing items don't always end up dominating the game. It takes strategy and a good aim to win not overpowered weapons. If I had to compare this another game, I would say its a mix between CSGO and Call of Duty. There is strategy involved but the gun system is more Call of Duty like. Personally I think this game would be a lot more fun with more game modes.

[b]Rating:[/b] 8/10 (For a Free Game)
[b]Should you play this?[/b] Yes
[b]Comparison:[/b] CSGO and Call of Duty Mixed"
18942,"Very fun, kind of like RSS if you look at the combat of the game, rarely do I get bored playing this game. Highly Recommend."
18943,"Great game, engine is good. I reccomend it to anybody who enhoys fps titles like CS:GO, CoD and Battlefield"
18944,"This game is not a good FPS in my opinion. Where you are easy enough to get guns, and also having a shortage of weaponary. Not that much of a customization or maps."
18945,"Just started playing this game. It's a very good, simple FPS and you'll probably really like it if you prefer run-and-gun style gameplay. No pay to win whatsoever."
18946,"After Combat Arms got infested with Hackers, I had no other choice but to search for another similar shooter to full fill my need. I tried a couple of them, such as Warface, Phantomers, Dirty Bomb. I was considering buying CSGO until I found Black Squad. What caught my attention was the ""NO-pay-to-win"" headline, and I'm really glad this is actually true. 

At first, the game give me really good impressions, specially the graphics and gameplay, but after 2 months playing everyday, I can finally give my ""final"" analysis. 

The Graphics: They are good and runs smoothly in my laptop, tho they aren't impressive or revolutionary. The character model is really interesting and well done. Tho, the scenery lacks of detail, in most of maps we have those huge, flat, corridors with little detail. There is also not much happening in the background. 

The Gameplay: I really enjoy the gameplay, but comparing to Combat Arms, I found harder to control the gum while shooting. I was used to shot in burst mode instead of full-auto, that give my shooting much more precision (in Combat Arms) But here in Black there isn't the same, it's not that big of problem, but affects me a lot. Also, the lack of ladders, tilt aim and climbing edges really bothers me. 

The modes: I really love ""Capture"" mode, it's so much fun. Sometimes strategical, sometimes like a real freaking war! Hahaha! It's really too bad we have only two maps for this mode. Also, the Korean version have more modes I want to try out, such as Airborne. The other modes are the same you expect from an arcade shooter. TDM is cool, tho the maps don't help much. 

The Maps: They are the lowest point of the game unfortunately. There are some few good maps, but most are really boring and unimaginative. Mirrored maps help balance the match, but it's so boring! It's really sad, cause the game is cool. I mentioned that Capture Mode has only 2 maps, both nice maps but you can get tired pretty quickly. I wish there was more maps for Capture mode, perhaps with two Capture points! (that would be hell on earth, but interesting). Combat Arms had much better maps, I have to say. Hope they fix this by adding more maps in the future. 

The guns: No complains, tho there are really few shotguns and pistols. I wish there is an option to customize your gun, adding scopes/sights or hand grips to improve stability. I also miss some of my favorite guns, like the FN F2000.

The paid content: It's not pay-to-win, but there is paid content, in form of skins for weapons and characters. These paid content doesn't give any advantage to the player, it's purely cosmetic. Witch is really nice! Thanks! But, I really wish I could just go and buy the stuff I want, instead of those annoying random boxes (yep, you buy loot boxes). 

The Verdict: It's a really nice free-to-play online action military FPS. The best part is not being a pay-to-win game. Isn't perfect, tho it's really competent, I'm sure they will add more content in the future, and things will improve significantly. 

MORE MAPS FOR ""CAPTURE"" PLEASE! :D"
18947,It's a pretty damn fun FTP
18948,Really awesome game. Hope you guys like it.
18949,"Okay so, this game has a ton of potential. It's a great FPS and the fact that it's free makes it better. You can change out your weapons and change how your character looks, and you can just have a massive amount of fun. Playing my first match on this game was a blast, I had so much fun running around the map shooting and even dying. This game just has so much potential and I wanna see it blow up, it would be amazing if this game had a larger playerbase"
18950,"i want to play ""COMPETITIVE"" match in this game. like 5 vs 5 or 10 vs 10 with rank"
18951,"Amazing game! nice graphics too :) Not the best but its ok
EDIT: Its a better game since the full release!!"

Just a small thing, i know this is still early access but maybe have better/closer servers in the future!

Other than that, it's 10/10 :D


NOTE: after I posted this I started getting MUCH better ping, lovely! :D"
18959,A good free to play game.
18960,This My Favourite Game.When i get bore i play this game.this game has better quality but some times there is a server problem when start the game.but i like it any away :) :)
18961,done!

Being a F2P game i never thought it was this good

18965,its fine
18966,free version of cs:go
18967,"Free to play! just try it. if you enjoy fps sure you have a great time. after 1 year still got strong community. hopefully game will become stable in the future, currently the fps dropping the only issue for me to fully commited to the game"
18968,Best game that can counter counter strike
18969,"The game is well polished, not pay to win and fun to play. But, it has one setback which is the presence of hackers."
18970,Simple shooter cod style. Its free. good on lowish spec pcs. not bad considering its free.
18971,"Biggest update ever :
SKINS
SKINS

MORE SKINS
MORE DLC

18972,"Good game..
"
18973,"A very good fps and it is free to play,hope this will be better than cs:go in one day!!"
18974,Great Game
18975,not bad
18976,"For a free game, this game sure delivers and goes beyond. There are constant updates (at least once a month) and the game runs smoothy. There is a similarity with Counter Strike in some areas but it does have its own unique stance. I found this game fun to play with my friends and fair in its allocation of rewards. I would recommend giving it a shot."
18977,"Love this, so much fun :)"
18978,Fuvhing garhbage
18979,my strange addiction
18980,If you want to play cs:go but you're broke af like me
18981,"Nice game to play line ""CS-GO"".
its working very fine in multiplayer 
"
18982,"I can't really say much about this game. It doesn't really have anything that labels it as a bad game, but there's also nothing about it that makes it stand out. The guns offer some variance and I could tell the diffrence between assault rifles, but my performance saw no change switching from one to another. 

I guess the best way to classify this game is it's a poor man's counterstrike. I'm not recommending this game just because it doesn't have anything great to say about it, but it's free so no harm in trying it for yourself. I just think they're better ways to spend my time."
18983,Best Free to Play Fps Game
18984,i loved the way this game is cool :)
18985,kinda like a break away from cod. kinda feels like cod a bit. i like it
18986,like to play this kind of game . it tooks like
18987,"COD+CS:GO = Black Squad

and by the way, it's free;)"
18988,"Edited on 27 May, 2022 @ 11:32AM
Any changes VALOFE made destroyed the game further. The ""Reorganization of Melee Items Balance"" on 25 May, 2022 makes all the melee weapon become jokes. I played the game mainly for the melee games. So these ""reorganization"" are additional aside from the patch note:
- Melee weapon has different damage on different body part now. From highest dmg multipler to lowest: Head, torso, arms, legs.
- The range reduction is more than I thought, most of the ones which has attack range reduction becomes ""practically"" impossible to use. It becomes faster but none matter if the longer ranged weapon can practically OHK (one-hit-kill) now. More ""funny"" because if the melee with longer range misses, that player can retreat/run away and make more headshot attempts. Technically, most weapon that has the speed (advantage +1) get both range reduction and dmg reduction (disadv -2) while the longer range get the opposite things.
- The melee weapon stats preview in the shop/exchange-shop becomes invalid (or straight up a scam), they have the old preview before the rebalance. Take Nimvarus (the default melee weapon) Vs. Karambit: both has the same ""range 5"", but you can test it in gameplay and you get enlightened with a big lie.

As a melee player myself, this patch makes me feel like ""it's harder to balance the different weapons"" because ""the weapons has more factors to take account now"". I'll be frank, the melee weapon before the rebalance works very fine with me and it's mostly about players' skills (movement reading/prediction, strike/attack timing, distance reading/calculating, etc...Perhaps ""baiting"" is also one of them).

I don't dislike shovel as I used it from time to time but: As of writing this, Shovel has this change: ""Increase attack power, increase attack range, decrease attack speed"" and people can just use it as meta. Left-click spam and retreat/running without thinking works most of the time. This will favor anyone with lower ping and their judgement and actions has less thing to worry about.

P/s: In addition, the game is even more friendly toward cheaters now. Yes, you read it right: cheater-friendly. One can just enable aimbot (to the head) and hold left-mouse-button and they become highly trained professional melee players. I started to think the devs just switched to sell Cheat Programs behind-the-scene to make profit instead.

Thanks to ""VALOFUN"" who evals 0 fun, I feel like the game is not even worth my attention, let alone recommending to others.

18989,Fast and fun to play
18990,Good game to play!!
18991,"Fast paced, early CoD style game. really fun to play and has a good skill cap, easy to understand. At the time of writing this review i have 32 hours played on a free to play game; that's pretty good for a free to play game. Also this game doesnt shove microtransactions down your throat, rarely do i feel pressured to buy things in this game. definitly worth a download and play"
18992,"Not that bad, but not the best"
18993,DRAGUNOV BEST GUN
18994,good free game for relax game time..
18995,HELL NO HELL NO!
18996,This is probably the least p2w free fps game I have played in years. The community is also one of the least toxic i have seen in a long time on a fps (free or paid). Netcode seems pretty solid and gameplay is smooth (probably even if you have a old pc).
18997,GOOD GAME
18998,one of the best F2P ever
18999,"A very good and in-depth game for being free to play.

Its like CoD and CSGO had a love child and this was the great infamous creation that is Black Squad..."
19000,Nice and fun game.
19001,F2P with no P2W material.
19002,WOULD BE A GREAT GAME IF NOT FOR BATTLE EYE NOT DOING ITS JOB OF STOPPING AIM BOTS AND WALLS HACKS.
19003,"Really brings nothing new to the table, atleast weapons aren't rentals. Pretty boring, and almost zero reasons to look down sights. It's CS/CoD for poor people."

Overall It's great game"
19030,Bland and uninspired. Just another fps drifting into the sea.
19031,i love it
19032,i love that
19033,Reminds me of an old game i used to play named K.O.S Secret Operation in the Phillipines but got terminated really recomend other people to play this game and its so satifying to shoot
19034,Basically Cod + Csgo for free. What more could one want?
19035,"once you play this, it grows on you like a fungus"
19036,"Good game, without pay2win"
19037,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
19038,Its a good game
19039,best game 10/10
19040,It's not Pay 2 Win at least. But it's the most generic shooter I have ever played. The graphics and animation are functional but the very slow movement along with the very high bullet damage leads to a lot of camping. Not exactly sure what this game brings to the table that others don't.

19042,Better then CS:GO...
19043,"Good gameplay, nice grapic. One of the best 0.00$ in the world ;)"

Thank you black squad team!
"
19046,Its the most addictive game i have ever played after CS GO. It would be nice if we could get invetory system like skins and guns for this game.
19047,"awesome, could use some touches here and there, but it's good for starters."
19048,A free to play first person shooter thats actually not pay to win. I mean where can you find a game like this?
19049,"CSGO+COD.?? Yes...kinda true.Pretty fun to play. Varity of matchmaking, skins and lots of other stuff.Want else can you expect for free!!! :)"
19050,ok
19051,damn so good tho
19052,The game is very cool.Good job guys!Recommend this game!!
19053,"Kind of like an estranged child of CoD and CSGO, but its ok because you can't hear everyone else screaming."
19054,"even though this games still in alpha, its still a pretty good game, although some aspects like a report system would be great, and hopefully a way to purchase skins off the steam market than in game would be good, but if youre looking for a game to play every once in awhile or alot, this games pretty good for your needs"
19055,"It's an okay game. If you have nothing really else to do and want a simple shooter then you just might like this. I hope that the developers will one day implement a report or kick feature for hackers or trolls. As for the content, it's not really pay to win because if you are decent at the fps genre then you can still do really well if not the best in your team."
19056,"Fun game, no pay2win element whatsoever, evey gun can be purchased with just playing the game and the premium boxes contain only skins.

I am no longer a twitch partner of this game as of November 2018, but I hope to apply again for it in the future.

My positive review still stands.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT:

edit as of may 2021: It's been a few months since the change of publisher and this game has dwinling population now because the publishers are a bunch of scumbags.

DON'T GIVE THEM A SINGLE CENT, MARKET IS DEACTIVATED SO ANY MONEY YOU GIVE THEM IT GOES DOWN THE DRAIN.
THEY ARE TRYING TO KILL THIS GAME."
19057,"Call of Duty Free2Play, complete with wall hacks, aimbots, and lopsided balancing you could ask for. Could be fun to play at times depending on what server you get on..."
19058,"This is an excellent Free-To-Play FPS game. It is one of the best all-around games I've ever played. Although I'm probably not what's considered a ""hardcore"" gamer, I do enjoy this game a lot, and would recommend it to anyone. 

It is not pay to win at all, as the gun you start off with is just as good as any other gun, just with different specifications. It is also easy to purchase guns. The maps are well made, and are fun to play. 

People complain about hackers, but I have encountered very few of them. Some people are just dang good, and others like to whine about it. 

No obvious negatives off the top of my head, so just do yourself a favor and try it out. A+ Review"
19059,"Its Pretty much fun to play it for people who don't owned CS:GO and Black Squad have its own awesomeness..

Mostly,it have a good skin of weapon and its pretty much different then CS:GO.. :)"
19060,"Fun free to play game. The Devs actually make fun of people who use money to purchase items in game by calling the purchased currency BS coins.
There is a decent selection of guns, knives, and maps. Guns each have their own feel to them. Seems to be balanced well. Multiple modes to play: team deathmatch, clan battles, hostage, and several others.

Good base of a FPS, and still being worked on."
19061,One of the best free to play games. Alot of fun.
19062,This game is legitnessssssss
19063,Yeah its perdy good
19064,"If u dont want to get a game ban record on your steam profile cuz you too good at the game, then dont play it, my friend here sniper main, actually good, been play for awhile, former championship of CrossFire Vietnam. Get a Ban record because he ate too many reports at once while playing competetive. Dev be like: this person is sus, lets ban him. Complete no evidence of he using any cheat program. A dissapointment. Roast me if want."

19075,"Insane potential, but still needs some work until it's perfect for me. I give it a go everytime after a big update, just to check out the changes made. So far they haven't made the right update, to make me stick to the game like i did with other fps games.

Edit after 1500 hours into it:
- The anticheat is useless. The game has been invaded by hackers...
- The game still has bugs even after leaving ""Early Access""
- Toxic community
- Unbalanced maps
- Matchmaking needs to be improved
- All of the new updates are useless, because they only add new skins and stuff

And yet, here I am, still playing it..."
19076,good game
19077,It's a good game.  I just want to be able to lower my graphics even more and be able to play in full screen mode.
19078,Dont want to pay for Counter Strike? Download this.
19079,Devs seriously need to do something before it's too late...
19080,"Very addicting and enjoyable game, It is NOT pay2win

Mix of Call of Duty and CSGO

"
19081,this is fun
19082,"[b] Reasons why i not recommended this game ""2020""

This game is literally unplayable, can’t believe the devs do nothing to fix this game!

1. Cheaters ~> Boost service in ranked - competitive. 

2. Laggers 120-250ping - lagswitchers ~> killing you behind wall, teleporting in front/behind of you, alot of my bullets going through the enemie 0 dmg given, I dying before I see the enemy comming around the corner, In some rounds you can pre-aim and start shooting before the enemy comes around and still die earlier.  RIDICULOUS!!!

3. Netcode Broken.

4. Unbalanced ranked.

5. Full of bugs / glitches / errors. *game crash without any error*

6. Hit boxes problem.

7. Server tickrate 30 or less.

8. Player Base = 2000~2500 online, game is dying!!!

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME TO PLAY THIS SH*T!

19101,"A really nice FPS, running fluently on the Unreal 3 Enginge. Performance is everything! I love the destruction mode. I hope more gamers will join in the future, so that Black Squad keeps being on air.

The only contra i see so far, is the mass of cheaters. If this could be resolved, maybe the best thing for this shooter will/would be possible anytime soon: E Sports adoption. Than players would make a one time payment, for example, to join that fun inbetween CS:GO and Call of Duty."
19102,"100% recommend. Perfect game , can't stop playing... The best of fps 4 me!"
19103,"Best FPS game ever. Beautiful graphics, hit reg, fun, free and not pay to win only skins in-game, highly recommended! Company was involved in making Alliance of valiant arms this is a AVA 2 if anything! Thank you for the awesome game!"
19104,Too many cheaters but a great game
19105,"Update 01/08/2019

Taken at face value this game is really fun to play.  The matches are fast paced and can get very brutal.  The maps allow for multiple points of attack and very few bottlenecks to slow down the action.  The only thing that completely ruins this game is the dam community!  There is far too many performanced enhanced hackers to let us enjoy this game.  Autofire, bullet spray removal, and a host of other enhancements makes some of these players impossible to play against.  Almost as bad as someone running an aimbot but far less obvious.  You put almost a whole clip into someone to have them drop you with a quick tap.  Now, I'm not the best gamer out there but I will get the drop on someone every now and then but it's impossible with this level of hacking.  The stragiht up matches are a blast but when you get the hacktards rolling in acting like pro players it loses its appeal very quickly.

Unfortuantely the Devs completely ignore the cheating and let the hackers go on their merry way.  You see the same people every time and getting called out by several people but there is no consequence to their actions so why bother to stop?  Bottom line as long as the Devs are making money their is little chance they are going to care or do anything about these hackers. 

To me this game has passed the point of no return and shall be stricken from my hard drive just like every COD crap game I have ever wasted time on.   
_________________________________________________________________________

Early Access Update:  This game is devolving into a hacker's game (who has the best hacks).  Typical community blind eye to the problem that if you complain you are just a terrible gamer.  Throw the shooting mechanics out the window because crosshair locks all over the place turning every weapon into a 100% accurate weapon from the hip with no way to prove they are cheating.  Dev's don't seem to care about the cheating because why ban the few people who are playing this game.  The game is fun when you remove the cheating element.  Close games can be really enjoyable but the bad games full of cheaters are beginning to outnumber the good games.   


""Battleye support, dedicated servers, great shooting mechanics and amazing netcode. Black Squad is a military first-person-shooter game using the Unreal Engine 3 to show realistic graphics and dynamic visuals. Absolutely no Pay-to-Win. Welcome to the best F2P shooter on the market.""

First off, ""great shooting mechanics"".... Yeah that would be a no since every weapon has about the same accuracy and hip fire is just as accurate as aiming down the sights.  No real bullet spray (as there should be) so you can just run with a sniper rifle and make kills.  Game wants to be a COD clone but takes all the things you hate about COD and throw them into normal gameplay.  Gameplay is mostly running in circles, bunny hopping, and spraying at everything.  Spam grenades hoping to get lucky.  The graphics look good, maps need to be a little bigger, and no there is no pay-to-win option because you can earn everything right in game.

Anti-cheat system seems to be useless.  Games full of hackers stating they are professional players.  Given the horrible shooting mechanics they are not as easy to spot.

Very toxic community.  Given this is an Early Access game people should be allowed to voice things they would like to see changed but dare to say anything about changing the game and you will be attacked by trolling little children.  Yelling at you to go play some other game and not provide any opinions."

19107,"no longer a good game, full of hackers."
19108,"dear black squad how about u all make voice chat next updates .... btw great games ever  and this games make me addicted haha after i play dota 2 for first round then i play bs haha...

p/s : please make animation for climbing ladder and want squatting when want to turn left and right.. the old animation kinda look funny ahha"
19109,"this game still good , up to now !
when i'm using knife to kill their sniper in the back , the Battle Eyes kick me from battle ?? wtf ?"
19110,each time i click the play button the game wont start.
19111,"pistals do no damage, all is over priced, boxes have lowestr odds ive found. 

its a fun game but not if oyu dont want to pay money,

lagggg is terrible too"
19112,Piece of crap
19113,It's good graphics and good teammates... this is a very good game its very advantage is when u are about to win you can get a adrenaline rush while playing and you can comeback and win the game.. happened to me many times as i played 30 hrs because i too is a decent FPS player. And i nominated this beacause it deserves it. :)
19114,Pretty gosh darn addicting once you start really playing.
19115,"No controller support, so easy to add....brainless devs, I don't give a F if mouse and keyboard is better......They even block you from using any kind of controller-kb mouse emulators, real f-ers. uninstalling this junk"
19116,"Very nice FPS game, i recommend this game very much. Must try."
19117,awesome game
19118,MMMM IS GOOD
19119,it's very good for a free game
19120,"ok, this game is actually not bad. I expected it to be bad because it looks like a mix of COD and CSGO but even tho it has its own thing I don't know how to explain. downside is that there is no voice communication which makes it boring at one point and also it gives huge advantage for those who play with friends on programs like discrod or Teamspeak because they can give information to each other,  also it feels like dmg on guns are inconsistent like I could be shooting 10000 bullets at enemy and yet he's still alive and sometimes they die by taking 3 shots from that same weapon without taking any dmg before. after few hours of playing it becomes repetitive and kinda boring tbh. my verdict is 7 / 10 not bad, have potential but lack few stuff to be a very enjoyable game (with voice communication it would be 8 maybe even 9 /10 )"
19121,Please make a server near to the Philippines or in the Philippines cuz lot of us are getting mad because of the ping!
19122,too much ping (australian)
19123,"Even though this game is slightly unoriginal, as some people say. This is still one of the best free FPS, and probably one of the only worth playing free-to-play FPS ever."
19124,"game is trash . you shoot the crap out of people and dont kill them then they shot you one time and kill you .. what a joke 

worst fps i have ever played 
"
19125,"literally broken, no balance at all, run and gun simulator, you don't need any skill, half of the guns are fucking laser beams and other half have obnoxiously high recoil, snipers doesn't need any skill to use, toxic player base, you will get your ass kicked by players 40 times your level because there is no balance in level matchmaking, level 1 players get matched with other players with level 30, anti-cheat system more useless than VAC, in some maps the bomber team get in the spot first than the defenders, no sense of team work unless you are playing with some friends, you waste like 2 magazines in the enemy, and he just shoot 3 bullets at you and you are already dead, your bullets are made of paper, if you want a competitive experience besides cs:go / rainbow six siege, keep searching, there is no balance in this game, the bastard son of cs and cod"
19126,"This game is ridiculous.  I have been trying to play this game for the past few days and have received numerous errors while trying to do so.  Error code 000c00F, ""maintenance(7)(3)"" etc...

I have barely been able to play the game with less than 10 hours of gameplay over the past week.

Now I'm banned???/

This is ridiculous,  14+ years on steam and I get a ban and tarnished account?
EXTREMELY Pi$$ed off.

Will be contacting steam immediately,"
19127,hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm? idk
19128,This thing does not work for me i press play then nothing happens
19129,Succ game. Look in the steam discussions for some truth.
19130,"Very fun, its like any other AAA shooter, but its free. highly reccomend."
19131,"After some hours in this game, I would say, stay out...
Overwhelmed by hackers, BattleEye protection is a joke and the crate system is plain steal.
20€ and you get nothing. Better buy CS...
For a free game, doesn't mean that you can easily overlook sh1t...
Play at your own risk...
"
19132,"This game is OK to play when you wanna take a break from other shooters, but the only thing bad about this is finding games.... It takes well over 10 minutes just to find a game using the ""quickgame"" options, the whole point of quickgame is to find a game, QUICKLY. 

5/10"
19133,"I actually like this better than CS:GO. I was an active CS:S player in the days and really dislike CS:GO. But Black Squad is a very nice game that ""brings back"" atleast some of the fun to us that is not moving over to CS:GO.

It does take sometime to get used to, and i still havent figured out everything. But still a game i will use more time on."
19134,"damn, great game, have a nice performance!!
"
19135,"money grab, tons of hackers

DO NOT INSTALL!!!"
19136,Please remove all the players whos using map hacks and auto aim.
19137,""" Absolutely no Pay-to-Win."" this is the reason why I got this game and really there is pay 2 win and due to them lieng. How can we ensure the rest of the description is not fake and plus for the love of god please do not get this game its grenade physics are crap (meaning that it sticks to one place and it doesn't bounce) and all an all it feels like an cheap  arcade game that you can  pay a few dollars to play at your nearest mall or theme park arcade! Just please dont waste your diskspace and save some space for other more worthy games....God speed."
19138,"
I like this game. I wish they would make AI perm. Also if they do make it perm, I wish they give you healer or make medkit cheaper. Also I wish they would kick people who hack. I notice people who hack names cannot be kicked."
19139,Game Fucking God
19140,awesome game
19141,I was bored out of my mind playing this.
19142,Graphics look like Golden Eye from N64.
19143,"Very fun game, Kind of like CSGO love it 10/10"
19144,NICE GMAE
19145,wery good
19146,this  is the best fps game..dont listen to others ..u will enjoy if u like fast paced millitary  shooting..plus it can also run smoothly on low specs
19147,"This game is like a good mix of Call of Duty (not the shitty ones i mean like BO2 and WWII) and CSGO. It Takes all the fun aspects from both games and combines them into one clusterfuck of funness. Though it does have some bugs, it is an early access game, so it will have bugs. bugs include little lag spikes every now and then and thats real it. kthxbai"
19148,"1) To all the people saying it's a CSGO clone... you've never played CSGO.
2) All tactical elements... none? Uh... there is almost 0 tactical go ahead. You don't have to move slowly because you can just wipe entire groups of enemies with your super lazor cannongs that they give you because power ups are cool... I guess...
3) This is A CALL OF DUTY CLONE MORE THAN ANYTHING.
4) CoD clone makes it shit...
5) Guns don't kill people... nothing like eating up 30 bullets to the chest. Feels good.
6) No ability to change class in game to meet different situations.
7) Accuracy system is ass because it's easy mode. Guns barely have recoil so getting instant 2 hit headshots are cake walk eazy mode.
8) Minigun all day to win...
9) Why are we even considering this f2p repeat garbage... it's the same as every other f2p shooter...
10) Just don't..."
19149,Nice Game Loved It
19150,Its not as good as it looks
19151,why this game keeping alert anti-hack while im not hacking  :@ fk u
19152,"WOW GOOD CSGO WORTHY MHMMMM 
"
19153,Very fun mmofps. Very limited in the pay to win depatment so far which is a huge plus.  Cant wait to see what this game grows into!!! Very promising
19154,Verygood game
19155,"stupid ugly game lol
"
19156,"PING  |  LAG

There's no Asian server,so the ping is an issue."
19157,"another generic f2p trash shooter with bad netcode. you'll often snipe them in the head and hear hit sound but niggas just dont die 50% of time
meh"
19158,I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes first person shooters. It is free to play and isn't absolute garbage
19159,"[h1] ""A definite alternate for CS:GO!"" [/h1]

This game was one of my very first downloads from steam, and even with the games ""Team Fortress 2"", and ""Counter Strike: Global Offense"", I still play this from time to time! This game has pros and cons, but I am sure the average player would find this game amusing for its price / quality. 

Here are some of the pros of this game.
[list]
[*] Runs GREAT on low budget PC.
[*] Gameplay that is leveled and easy to enjoy.
[*] Balanced Guns, almost none of them are Over Powered!
[*] New maps come out all the time, and they are actually good!
[/list]

Now some cons.
[list]
[*] Not to many customization options at all
[*] 1 - 2 minute wait times for gameplay.
[*] No voice chat
[*] No user `help` (No Workshop Support)
[/list]

Overall, this is a decent game! I say its a rating of... [i] 8/10 [/i]
But thats my opinion, try it out for youself!"
19160,"works pretty good with low end PCs , I have a fx quadro 3450/4000 sdi , which is not a gaming GPU but it does work , , honestly i  am not a big fan of these maps nor the game UI  but the gameplay is pretty nice and fair"
19161,Feels kind of like an in-browser game. Not impressive.
19162,Love the game. It's a lot of fun with friends.
19163,its just call of duty and cs go when u take it way to fucking far
19164,More addicting then drugs
19165,"Great one to play! Nice sound, Visualy looks great, Gameplay feels awesome as well. Knife is so easy to get. This game is not Pay To Win."
19166,"COME SUGGERISCE ER GIOCO QUESTO è PROPRIO UN GIOCO DA NEGRI DEMMERDA, NA CAGATA PAZZESKA SE SEI NEGRO TE PIACE FORSE"
19167,nice game and good graphic i like very much
19168,"Black Squad is definitely a fast paced fps that will capture your lightning fast senses while playing. Sitting still waiting for the enemy to approach will certainly get you shot. You have to take the fight to the enemy. The range of guns is useless because all you need is a few top rifles to make this game interesting. It could use a ""q"" and ""e"" movement. 
"
19169,"This is a GREAT game! Best of all it's FREE! Runs Great, Looks Great, And the gameplay is TIGHT! Quick and to the point. Once you set up your binds and adjust your mouse sesitivity the game is spot on! It is ""NOT"" a Pay-To-Win game. You can make purchases to buy skins and stuff but it is just for cosmetic stuff. Everyone has the same abilities and the same advantages with the default weapons available in game that you can purchase with points earned by playing the game and moving up in rank. I can honestly say that this game is my favorite team based FPS game. Even over some of the other games I actually paid for. Check it out, You will not be dissapointed!!!"
19170,"Bom, porém poderia ter Voice Channel, ajudaria mt na comunicação! Mas tirando isso, otimo jogo."
19171,"9 hours in i can aim everyweapon unlike other games that have been released of late....for a person that playes on a laptop with integrated graphics this is a and still 70 frames im not gonna fight that and with time should or even does stand in the ring with cs:go 

i could be wrong but there is no ranking system that keeps the new player outta games with vets reguardless i still have a decient kd ratio 

to the dev goodjob guys
11/18/2017"
19172,good csgo type game
19173,yes papi
19174,fuck this game
19175,fun game because it has a lots of maps i was playing 4 hours and its super fun
19176,"good game bro
"
19177,"Great free-to-play first person shooter with no pay-to-win gimmicks.
Nice, frequent updates with weapons and maps.
This game can fill that nostalgia gap for those who enjoyed Combat Arms.
Many fun game modes.

9/10"
19178,"When you first play this game, 
Meet jumping players with snipers get headshots on you
Hear the spam of Tac Reload
Realized that you downloaded it because you most likely didn't have enough money for CSGO
"
19179,I love this game but theres lag on my screen
19180,Savage play for free game.Plenty of servers to join with multiple game mode's.Could do with some new map's at some point.Big fan of sniper mode :0  ranking up is quick if you give the game some time and play it.
19181,if you get this it takes a while to download but when you open north america maps glithcehs and its just boring
19182,Great free to play game. Maps can be repetitive but the community is good. People complain about cheaters but I havent noticed too much. Worth a try if you enjoy fps games.
19183,"knockoff GS:GO, shit mechnanics to top it off"
19184,Its more like counter strike game especially the concept of playing with your team and seek for the enemy and if you are counter terroreit u must not let the terrorists plant the C4 .
19185,Haven't even completed the tutorial and I already think it's an awful game.
19186,"No wonder this shit is free... 
Turning 360 degrees with a 2400 DPI mouse on the highest sensitivity takes about 6-7 huge mouse sweeps...
This game is clearly made by idiots, for idiots!"
19187,very good
19188,"kick by anticheat by regular 3 kill 
fucking game 
dont download it 
Poor anti cheat system"
19189,not bad
19190,try it once
19191,"i just played this game, for only 15 minutes and i can already tell what kind of game its gonna be. its another fps game with cod like feel but a lot of CS:GO inspired controls as well. its a nice change i guess from the norm and a really well put together game from what i can tell. but there is one problem, you can just jump around and shoot people, and the accuracy is amazing while jumping. im not sure if thats what you would want in a fps game, but i know it really keeps me from playing it safe when i can just run and jump around a corner and get easy kills because no one is expecting it. great game for Early Access, but defniatly some changes are needed to keep the game going"
19192,Awesomeness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
19193,Literally now the only thing that this game needs is more players. Great game.
19194,"Arguably the best free-to-play FPS ever created and I've played a lot of them (Combat Arms, Soldier Front 2, Alliance of Valiant Arms, etc). The gameplay is very smooth, their is definitely a skill gap which allows for high level gameplay but some players who are new to FPS games may find it frustrating. The competitive scene died within a month or two of release due to the lack of support from game developers though. If you're looking to compete, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a solid free game to play with your friends, this is the game for you."
19195,"Look, lots of potential, but right now its a pay to win cs:go. Its cheaper just to go by any counter-strike than play this, and I am not even that big of a CS fan. It could be so fun, but they had to add random ass OP and just out of place shit. There is an extremely cartoony oversexualized female model you can buy that actually gives you a smaller hitbox and more health. No downsides. Its OP, out of place, and its kinda sexist, though I am not a woman so eh thats up to them to decide. There are actual weapons that will one shot you will fulll accuracy, no recoil, and shoot as fast as a Vector. So yea, just go get CS:GO or any counter strike and I assure you you will have a less stressful time."
19196,"This game wouldn't even start 0/10 IGN.com

literal shit"
19197,kusoge
19198,Was going to play.... saw that I'd have to pay $20 to be a girl.... NO
19199,"I suck at this game, but its fun so download it
"
19200,The maps are just bad. They feel so boring. They are just wayyyy too small. They all result in major clusterf*cks because there is almost no option for tactical advancement are interesting placement. Just go into this funnel and shoot.
19201,Game needs improvment .... As for 2017 graphics really look too simple and cheap ... Movement and aiming is not as comfortable and natural as in the other shooters .... Also i do think this game haves some hakers .... In few of the matches guy with similar nickname to this one 034934932r3 just kept shredding me on sight ....
19202,Hahahahahaha. crap game. waste of 6gb of my Monthly Data Cap.
19203,Well this game is something between CS:GO and COD... I like it. They should just add competitive match with rank skill.
19204,"controls are awful movement is slow hit reg is awful, its rehashing combat arms"
19205,GIMME MY ACHIEVEMENTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
19206,Sick
19207,"Disspointing thing is, 1) it is not Tactical Shooter Game
2) it looks like cod but acts like counter strike"
19208,soooooooo good for a free2play game
19209,"Fantastic game. There are some hackers here and there (no I'm not a bad player that's salty, look at the discussion page, there are a ton of reports (not that devs read forum hacker reports)) - and there's no report button."
19210,"I am not really into fps but I really like this. its easy to get into and yet it motivates you to come back to unlock the other weapens. If you like fps you must def try this one out maybe its gonna be to ""bare bones"" for you but its still in early access and its for free so you have nothing to lose except some time to try it out. also UNTIL NOW it is NOT pay to win it is only skins and characters that you can buy. there is one gun i think that you can only buy but all the stats are worse then the already existing free guns availible. the only minus for me is that there are not so many maps yet> have fun"
19211,"Its not the best FPS but its well-balance f2p game (and not p2w at the moment im write this).
All the weapon in game can obtain by playing the game. and its quiet fast to gain in game money too (compare to other f2p game out there.)  more importanly.. ""skins"" are only cosmetic !!  (both weapon and char) this isnt happen very much with f2p fps from korea.

I have heard someone said this game is p2w but its not p2w at all but this game isnt perfect.
First down side imo is the quick match system is a bit weird sometimes game throw all newbie fight agienst vet players.

i dont know if its only happen to me but sometimes quickmatch use too long time to find any matches (my longest time is 5 mins till it found a game). Why its call quick match when its slower than custom match lol

another qm problem is most of the time its random in to the same map everytime i queue up. It'd be better if players have a choice to choose which map they want to search for.(or at least option to not playing the same map over and over again)

Hackers issue is the same with other f2p game so i dont really care about it cuz every f2p fps (or even paid one) have this issue and noone seems to be able to fix that.

In game community is really toxic (im playing on SEA sv).  I think its normal for f2p fps but still, its very toxic (or cancer u name it)  i wish dev have something to do with this. Because this reason alone can stop players from playing the game.

If anyone i know asking me is this game good? 
I'd say its good. 
But if they ask me do i recomend this game?
I'd say no. Its not that kind of game u'd like to play repeatedly with a lot of problem in this game right now.

6.5/10 
p.s. my english is bad i know. but its not my first language doe :D  





"
19212,Very similar to BO2 which I like and it's free :)
19213,LOVE THIS SHIT!!!
19214,its cancer
19215,"fast paced, highly enjoyable fps. would recommend."
19216,Nice game
19217,"hello. i can't seem to purchase Bullets. .my steam acc have enough balance to buy bullets but i just can seem to buy it. .""purchase failed"". my overlay setting is on. ."
19218,"Free to play COD (with some elements borrowed from CS:GO) with good optimalization. Nothing original or really great, but enjoyable."
19219,love it
19220,good game
19221,"Where should i begin, idk. Uninspired maps, well they are Inspired by other Games which isnt making the fact any better. The Gunplay is, well. It just doesnt feels ""good"" for me. The weapons feel like a cheap version of CoD, and they also sound like that. I really liked the amount of Costumization the game offers for your Sensivity, but why cant i just adjust the FUCKING numbers. Using the sliders was a Pain in the ass. It just doesnt feels good after all. The whole gameplay is so slow and the gunplay tries to be fast and it just doesnt works for me. Also, why cant a Special Forces Soldier sprint? Is it a new rule in Warfare? Idk. I dont like it. Yet. Still, its early access but in this state i wouldnt recommend it unless you are really, really broke."
19222,CSGO for the poor.
19223,"It is weird to go from a game that has those ""that should have hit"" to ""im a god"" feeling game. Run and gun feels really genuine. And this is crazy good progression for a free game. Just download it and give it a try. If you can get through the weird menus this game makes you write and awkward review like this one. I love you <3"
19224,"A Very Fun and Exiciting game i definitely reccomend other People to play this game as it has a wide variety of gun, maps and game modes"
19225,"My review of Camp Squad

PROS->
F2P
There's no p2w
Community not toxic
Game has nice graphics
Pretty ok maps
CONS ->
THIS GAME NEEDS A F.U.C.K.I.N.G. ANTI-CAMP SYSTEM
Full of campers
Hackers....Hackers everywhere
Needs a better Anti-cheat
Movement is kinda broken
Hard to earn in-game currency
Playing with a MG or LMG requires no skill at all
Gets repetitive pretty fast

I give this game a 6/10 but i don't recommend playing it.It gets real boring real fast."
19226,"it is a fun game to just shoot some stuff
most pepole say its a pay to win thats only if you want skins for guns and characters
you can also make a clan so you can get some of your freinds in there or make some new friends

my one problem with the game is it keeps crashing everytime i start up a match plz fix"
19227,graphics are ok. but the game is  bad.
19228,外挂横行，打不过外挂的就不要玩了，心脏不好的也别玩
19229,what happen 2/9/9 what i did not understand
19230,"Anti-Cheat system is a joke, if devs dont solveit, this game will die rapidly."
19231,"Its CS and COD with much better graphics and more cheesiness.

Being a tactical player this game made me cringe and want to punch a kitten but I made it through 2 matches and what would you know it's a perfect game for teens that is actually not pay2win.

Good:
- Looks decent, some animations are better than that of ""AAA"" games.
- It's your arcade shooter standard.
- Gives you a good starting point and comes with a tutorial.

Bad:
- Cringeworthy sound effects and visuals :D I just can't help myself, it makes me giggle whenever match starts and there's ""tac reloOOOd"" from every player xD
- I hate this type of shooters, just a personal choice.
- Crappy guns (they are well modeled actually but I'm not a big fan of next gen weapons OR fictional ""ak47"" LUL)

So all in all I don't recommend this game generally but if you're a teenager who's bored out of his/her mind and has nothing better to play this is the game for you and considering it's free to download I am giving it a thumbs up.

*Arma, squad, PR, S4 etc players should avoid it."
19232,Save up some money and buy a real game instead of wasting your time.
19233,"Even when I was doing well I was irritated, if you want a real FPS you are gonna have to buy it and if you want a free one get dirty bomb"
19234,"I lost the ""No Nut November"" because of the new girl charcters' boobs, overall the game is lit"
19235,"once you get used the confusing outdated UI it is amazing for a free game. I own many games and still play this one daily. CSGO is trash compared to this, the games sometimes take 100 seconds to get going but it is addictive. Every gun has its own playstyle and IT IS FREE! most free games are crap, salute to the devs for giving us a playable game that is actually pretty fun!"
19236,"It's a lovely game for sure
Great optimization for an early access game.✅ 
Nice shooting mechanics.✅
A lot of mods.✅ 
No P2W.✅
Servers stability.✅
Just need more attention for the normal shop.⛔
At the end its just 5GB.. So go download it and give it a chance."
19237,"Hi
"
19238,this is a awsome game u got to have it
19239,10/10 jiggel phyics for paid characters anime boobs
19240,"TL;DR:
CS:GO with flavor of CoD makes this game going toe-to-toe with CS:GO, and for me making it better ""alternative"".

Game is really obvious copy of Counter Strike playstyle, but I dont have feel that this game is rip-off but more like mod for game that changes stuff which makes this game much better than its counter part. Graphics are decent similar to CS:GO, gameplay is also similar but theres no buying weapons but loudouts which you buy before game like CoD. Doesnt have any P2W mechanics as far as I have seen.
What i dont like so much is kind of slowish currency gain (which is 4 in game). You get gold for playing (120+ matches for 1 weapon), medals for leveling up (100 on level up weapons are 2500) and didnt figure out where to spend real money currency. So you need about 12+ hours of play for gold weapon and about 20-30 for medals weapon which is a bit much for me.
What also seems stupid to me is grenades, their trajectory, physics and explosion effects are all kind of retarded, you can throw them really close, bounce like bouncy ball and explosions are from doom 2 era (on lower settings)

Overall great game that i would take over CS:GO any day."
19241,"Trash F2P game. Trash wonky spraypatterns and recoil. The worst maps ever, encuraging camping and punishing people for moving from their cover. Annoying tutorial."
19242,"I would no recommend this game, for the fact that if you shoot somebody in the head, say the chin right. it is considered an arm shot. The majority of the people who quit playing this game quit because NA does not have a ping limit and all these people with over 200 ping are coming and lagging to where you get a ton of hitmarkers, yet they dont register on them. I dont care if bryan kim says oh we wont put in a vote kick system because people will kick just to kick. i mean there is so many trolls that sit there and stand afk, or have over 900 ping and cant move, or you have somebody that just doesnt know up from down. and they should play tdm a game mode that doesnt take a little bit of skill. Also he needs to fix his ridiculous que times. Instead of putting more maps and such. he needs to fix his hitboxes, his damage output on guns. 

What Bryan Kim could do is......
-Make another NA server with a 200 ping limit
-Fix his hitboxes because a chin shot should not be considered an arm shot
-Fix his que times because its ridiculous sitting there for over 900 seconds in a game lobby waiting for one
-Fix gun damage instead of having a bullshit number that doesnt add up when ya do the math of hitting a player
-Also put in recoil patterns for guns


Doing these things would bring in even more money to this game cause people will start to like it, people are leaving because of alot of these issues. Do us a favor and please fix these ridiculous issues"
19243,legal
19244,best netcodes ever
19245,Boring after 2 matches
19246,This is a cheap version of CS:GO. This is free but i still would not recommed it.
19247,"Thougth this is like arma or Squad just in more close Quarters...
No this is just csgo for the poor."
19248,Sorry to say but this just isn't the game for me. If you're looking for a snipe fest that becomes very bland very quickly then this is for you.
19249,"Yeah it's free to play alright but recently this game is all about skins every update there is a lot of skins & lot of skins but they don't solve the issue's of core gameplay. No hit reg , Bad Server & Lots of cheaters. I know this game is still in beta version but i won't recommend until they solve the small things first. :3"
19250,"7.5/10
Recommend it
it is a very good f2p fps
but lacks weapon modification (attachment etc)
very good map weapons skins etc
would give 10 if weapon modification is added."
19251,GG
19252,It's not pay to win. A lesson EA could learn from a real f2p game. Also I love the arcade shooter style this game has. It's fun to hope in and play a game of tdm on their simple maps. And weapon unlocks are dependent on the time you've played. Each weapon is different and goes well with each players different play style.
19253,Good game .. is like cs go and call of duty.. try this game...
19254,Love this game <3
19255,"Posted a bug two days ago. Haven't heard anything from the devs or support. The bug is for UHD screens being unplayable as we can't even enter the game. There is no way to select the initial server to launch the game.

No official responses or help. I assume the devs are busy with other things. Too bad. Would've liked a reply or fix.

UPDATE: I did find a fix, you have to edit your .ini file. Google it. 
After getting into the game I find it's basically Halo where you run around a very small map, shooting anyhting that moves. It's a ton of fun for 15 minutes. Enjoy. -- If you want a better gun, you can buy one."
19256,I keep gettin sniped by anime girls
19257,"Just another awesome game, not pay2win, fun, easy for all, smooth, COD + CSGO = Black squad"
19258,its a good game recomended
19259,"Nice, fun, has good graphics and doesn't need much ram. Good fps game"
19260,Great game for people with no money to buy cs or call of duty
19261,awesome
19262,"This game isn't the best but it's not the worst. For free, this is a pretty fun game. Yes you will run into a modder here and there but you do on most games these days anyway. If your bored and want a game that can raise your blood pressure and be fun, I'd download it and try it."
19263,"Very good game really fun i love this game i would spend alot of money on it :P
"
19264,"This game is very awesome. Yes, it’s still being developed and 2 or 3 weapons are out of balance, but everything else is just perfect. And that’s coming from a guy who gave up on shooters a loooong time a go. And aiming down the side just gives that little extra that CsGO is missing. Try it out!:)"
19265,"one of the best free to play FPS on steam!!! 

no hackers
no pay to win

best part you can market items on community market!!! 

thanks :D"
19266,its been almost a year and iv kinda fallen in love with this game its so much fun!
19267,"Solid FPS. Segregation of servers helped alleviate A LOT of the high ping players. NOT Pay 2 Win, although there isn't much progression."
19268,Dosent have SEA severs
19269,The best free to play game on Steam. A mixture between CS:GO and COD; with a predominant CS:GO feel. Only thing that I would suggest is allowing players to buy and sell the guns using the Steam Market
19270,still not as good as roblox
19271,SKRRRRRT POPOPOPOPOP 8/8 M8 KYS R* GAYMZ
19272,it's a $0 game...
19273,bad game
19274,d hgjfhgkjkl
19275,OMG best for 0 dollars but jeesh theyre deffinitly tring to rip off csgo and battlegrounds and also first person shooters they deffinitly need to make some improvements before ill try it again
19276,Most of the maps suck and you are basiclly fighting down 2 choke points most of the time but it is still pretty fun for a free to play game
19277,Tac reload
19278,"needs more work, looks like a beta in its current state







































also no au severs"
19279,nice game
19280,"Great Game, No pay to Win. Great F2P system.
It is alot like CS:GO though there are more guns and modes.
It is pretty fast paced depending on game mode. 

CS is Coca Cola.... It is the Original; the Classic.
BLack SQuad is like Pepsi, It's not quite Coke, but it's definitely a step above RC cola or Store brand.
Pepsi will Never be Coke but Pepsi is pretty dang good.... 

Cheers!"
19281,One of the best fps games i've played that is free to play.
19282,Its like Blackshot.......except theres less hackers and more fun and not pay to win. Itll be great if theres more weapon tho and even better if they decide to add DM (knifes only)  mode. Oh and pls...pls for the love of god show the damage that is given. Sometimes it took me like fkin 10 bullets to kill a guy. its okay that i died in the game i can accept that. What i cant accept however is knowing that you nailed fkin 8-10 bullets to the enemy face and they dont die. At least knowing the dmg gives kinda closure.
19283,AWSOME GAME.. NICE goooo with it
19284,"A very immersive shooter. It has, tolerable controls, and very good gameplay, its your everyday shooter and its quite fun to sit and play."
19285,i hate this game sure its free but still is sucks 1/10
19286,doidao
19287,Fun game very reminiscent of CS:GO
19288,nice game. somewhat P2W weapons and bullshit deaths sometimes but all around good one.
19289,"it's pretty good, i guess"
19290,"It's your average $30 shooter, except it's free to play."
19291,"After playing this game for about an hour, im too tired to play it more.This is why:
1.As some people mentioned-netcode.  The only available server for me is EU(80-160 ping) and the suffering i get when i try playing it is too much.
2. Hit registration-might be because of my ping, but even when the enemy stands still and i shoot him in the head(sniper rifle,pistol,assault rifle) he just turns around and insta kills me.
3.Balanced teams- teams are sometimes pretty strange. Today, i was the only one with kd at least 1-2, while all my teammates were just dying at spawn.

But the thing i noticed, its actually a pretty good game, if you compare it to warface(f2p shooter, p2w) If the netcode would be better, i would play it for hours, but when i get teleported every second, im not even going to launch it.
If you have a good internet connection-go for the game.
If you live in a s**thole like me-go play something else.
6 tactical reloads out of 10"
19292,best $0.00 i ever spent
19293,you can be braindead but if you have granades yuo can win the game
19294,Its like call of duty online. Only its not only for chinese.
19295,CSGO but Call of Duty
19296,"Pretty good game for its price which is 0$. I dont really find anything bad about this game and there is absoulutly no pay to win... Unless you're too lazy to play the game for a couple of hours to get new guns and cuztomizations.
I give it a solid 7.5/10. Anyone reading this should go up and install it to give it a try"
19297,Nice game but very hard! :)
19298,lol
19299,h mama sou
19300,"interesting game
"
19301,eh
19302,"The game is fun but the problem is the interface of the menu, it feels clustered and newer players will have a harder time navigating."
19303,Given that it's free is great
19304,Rocks!
19305,so fun
19306,Great game
19307,Bad quality and bad graphics
19308,"this game is amazing

better then call of duty
"
19309,"Two games in and people are already calling me a cheater

10/10"
19310,"5 stars for free game, top 
GOOD GAME :D"
19311,"Hey, Love the game however their is this one REALY anoying thing i like you use the scar-h gun but hate alway having to cycle through two scope types is their any way you could allow use to program a button to do this ie set a mouse button to veiw 1 ans veiw 2 or just let us pick which scope to use"
19312,"Very enjoyable as a Free Early Access Game, very little pay-to-win properties. If they can maintain the balance they have now, they will be very successful."
19313,"PROS: A goog game with decent graphics and decent guns. Getting kills is really satisfying too! I personally think this game is better than call of duty based on gameplay. The game modes are really fun (assasin being my favourite) and are good when you are bored. The levelling system is great with the titles being realistic.

Cons: The weapons are extremely overpriced and the currency is odd. The cases are 30,00 gold and thats pretty expensive for some grenades and collored gas. Personally i wouldn,t spend any irl money on this game. 

GIVE THIS GAME A GO AND YOU MIGHT LIKE IT :D"
19314,"game is extremly good would rate 5 stars 
best 4.5gb multi-player game 
smooth and logical gameplay
good guns and skins 
in shot 2nd best FPS game i had ever played after #csgo 
still playing 2k19 <3 best so far 
overall pretty nice game"
19315,"Game isnt that bad, however there are already cheaters.  Gotta love when people have 100+ kills when the rest of the team has about 8."
19316,"So far so good, well balanced for a F2P and no pay 2 win like what can be found now even in some full priced AAA or subsribtion based games........(you know what I'm talking about)
There are few maps especially in PvE (only one if I'm not wrong) and no AI practice but that's to be expected since it's an early access so looking foreword for more.
My only complain is there are no insta-kill headshots with most main weapons aside form some sniper rifles, and pistols feel like BB guns.
Overall: a great light CS like pfs for free but needs some polishing."
19317,"A lot of fun, a more fast pace version of CSGO. 10/10 would play again."
19318,TDM is sick ^^
19319,"its good if you like free fps games i guess..
"
19320,"bring back your old sensitivty options, untill then 5/7"
19321,"Fun game i really like the pricetag of the game, my only complaint is i dont think there are enough tac reloads we need more."
19322,very hard to control and graphic pretty bad ... but those who dont want to spend money to buy any FPS game should try this
19323,:))
19324,AMAZING FREE ONLINE GAME
19325,grenade launcher is too op = clusterfuck do not recommend.

19328,Great game Love it
19329,A+ Rated Game from those from Velociti Entertainment. This is a fun game. However tho there have many cases where i have ran into hackers.
19330,"Black Squad, i love ur game and love it when u guys update it!..I was wondering of i could get black squad id card
"
19331,love
19332,VERY GUD
19333,Nothing but a cash grab game who treats their partners like crap and the community in general by insulting their intelligence with things like adding so many unnecessary skins and no real improvement to the game.
19334,it is a fun game. I like it
19335,It's sad the way they tried to make this game look so cool. In the tutorial i litrelly did half of it and when i died i respawned back to the start and all the doors were locked so i coudnt finish it and i somhow used the airforce to drop bobs in the wrong location and i suddenly teleported back to where i died. Shame
19336,this game is good for a free to play...
19337,"Good game but need optimizations , unbalanced team death matches."
19338,"i never Write a review on games,.. Yes im that guy who reads reviews and doesnt post them..
But here goes...


For a free game this is the dogs nuts its in no way pay 2 win and a free game is very rare.. would i have bought this game 
knowing if knowing it was this good... Absalutly but free,.. ill try any game that is free and im glad i did download this game i even got a few of the lads to download it having lots of fun Its like a mixture of Call of duty (back when it was good) and counterstrike Source so you can tell its pretty damn good and very fun not been into shooter games for awhile apart from pubg and fortnight But you get the drift. ... well worth every bit of Gig on the harddrive :D"
19339,Its as if Counter Strike had a baby with Call of Duty
19340,"if the game have plant and defuse game mode it can be thrown to the trash right away (why do devs still try to copy cs go?,it wont work)
"
19341,"Show the skins, and no gameplay in a trailer, that sounds great!"
19342,Pay to Play
19343,"Really liking this game so far, I definitely recommend. This game is something between CS and Skill2SF. More like SF actually but with much better graphics, smooth and fast paced gameplay and very  very few hackers (at least I havent seen but only twice)
Reasons for Thumbs-Up:
1. Not pay-to-win, definitely
2. Fast paced and fun
3. Good mechanics and game mods (team deathmatch is best if you are bored by dying much :) )

Thumbs-Down for:
1. Since its F2P, there is a cash shop. Tho it doesnt affect your gaming much, if you want some skins or visuals or to grab your favourite weapon early game, you gotta pay. However, it aint necessary, you can just invest a little bit of time and you can nearly get anything from the cash shop (other than hot gal skins for your character :) )
2. Earning in-game currency by playing is slightly slower. Reasonable from developers' point of view, so that you support them by paying some real cash.

Give it a try, you wont be disappointed.
Good alternative for CS:GO
Much much better alternative than Skill2 Special Force.
"
19344,"то же самое, что и CS:Online, CrossFire, Warface и многие другие забытые всеми игры, имеющие идею F2P с 99% донатом и покупкой вещей на день, неделю и месяц.
Устаревший жанр, но подходит для тех, кому просто хочется потратить лишний вечерок в простом убийстве противников и ни о чем не задумываться. Ну, и ещё в игре можно купить золотые гранаты, да. Золотая дымовая граната. Стоит того."
19345,It's just like CS:GO and COD combined. Except that the viewmodel fov can't be change
19346,at least the weapon skin doesnt give any extra damage or advantage for the cash user.As i can say this is the almost good f2p game i ever played i would recomended this game if u wanna try skills vs skills f2p game and its free hahaha
19347,fun and enjoyable non P2W FPS!
19348,Cant start the game -_-
19349,fun game to play would recommend this to anyone interessted in a first person shooter thats free to play
19350,"Just as they said, the BSCOIN is BS


*review is neutral*"
19351,nice game
19352,"*Writes really bad review* 
Dont waste youre time even trying, its not good lol."
19353,"Fucking hell the maps are trash. So much camping. The maps usually have two side hallways are are a great place for camping. The game basically is JUST camping. Oh, and the spawn camping too! Actually shit map design."
19354,Counter strike killer
19355,"Only played an hour, but I have no complaints so far.

Pros:  It's basically discount f2p call of duty but without all the Activision.

Cons:  The game makes zero attempt to explain the UI or how progression works.  The tutorial showed me how to USE grenade launchers, medkits, airstrikes, etc...  But I still have no idea how to unlock the damn things.

I recommend so far.  If anything else comes up, I'll update the review."
19356,"Hello to the developers of this game. I would like to thank you for making aa game that is free, but also offers fast paced action, team based mechanics (Results vary), and the graphics are great, even on the Potato I have as of now. I would love to give feedback on every update, if possible. Although I only have 2 hours in the game, I must say, those hours were really fun. I was able to coordinate with a team and help bring support to those who needed it. I also like the system in which there is no Pay-To-Win. All weapons can be purchased by F2Ps or P2Ps, and there was nothing I didn't like about the game.

Overall, I give this game a 10/10 in my book. Thanks again for this great game.
"
19357,Love this game. Reminds me of the olden days of cs 1.6 but able to look down the sights. Fun to play with friends or by yourself
19358,"i love this game, it's fun to play and its just liek black ops!! <3"
19359,"No idea where they got those screenshots from but the game looks like it was made in 2005, plays like it too. You can find a handfull of games exactly like this, it's dull and uninspired. I swear a good 2 that i played had the near exact menu as this. This is just another poor mans CSGO"
19360,"Games is kinda cool, but looks like devs partying since august cuz they totally forgot about the game.Every single update is just skins and .... more skins.No voice chat,no ingame report system,no kick system,no updates about competitive scene.Also guns sound is similar to  toy guns.Overall:game is fun,worth to try,but if devs gonna keep working like that just leave this game, there are a lot of fps coming out in 2017-2018 ."
19361,nice game e
19362,great game! worth my time to download it! it could be better with a full campaign though. i definitely recommend this game to people who like first person shooters!
19363,Free to play my ass the shop is expensive as hell and there are a bunch of cheats and hacks in this game DONT waste your time and the admins are not doing crap about it.
19364,Not enough for steam.
19365,TAC RELOAD!
19366,"Not bad actually. I enjoy the game overall, but not  having the P2W guns like the AK puts me at a severe disadvantage, luckily 90% of the people with it have potato aim."
19367,"A great shooting game, fun missions and great guns. 10/10 would reccomend."
19368,"Previously gave a negative review, staff responded and I removed it to give them the benefit of the doubt.

2 months later, including tickets sent to the admins with video link proof of hackers, yet still no action taken.

This game is not P2W but it's definately a place for FPS hackers to play. That is, unless you are willing to pay for the hack itself.

Doubt I will come back again, as Black Squad has lost my trust in providing a fair and competitive gameplay for players.

Regards,
Melvin"
19369,"Was a part of the closed beta and since then you can tell the improvements whether it be from the game balancing to the anti-cheat actually working how its supposed to. For a Free-to-Play game it isnt bad at all and a pretty close competitor to csgo, plus its not pay to win, the only thing you have to pay for with money is the skins and some characters, but thats if ya really want to, so I recommend this to anyone whos parents dont want to give them £12 for cs :3"
19370,"Fun little game, somewhat decent gameplay but still requires server improments."
19371,"Free to play is free to play and not pay 2 win. Became addicted to the game the moment i downloaded it :p.
I'd suggest random boxes should have a limit, for every person who won it. This will force the game to make new skins. Agree?

"
19372,Great game thats really easy to get into. Market has a few issues with to many currencies but after a while it works. The lack of local servers on my side ment it was just a temporary place holder till I could afford Counter Strike XD
19373,really good game
19374,The name of this game is racist

--- REVIEW START ---

Fun game to play, if it actually works.
The 0x000005 error got resolved on the 9th of november, which took NeoWiz about 4 to 5 days to figure out and spread news about. (Read point, j)

I enjoy the game, my clan makes it fun. Playing competitively against better players than public matches makes it enjoyable aswell. But that doesn't mean the problems aren't there or that we , the NA and EU market don't face problems. I respect that this game is in early access in NA and EU but don't forget, this game is already available in Asia for quite some time.

PROS:

Game has huge potential in the EU and NA market to become big for the public aswell as competitive
Game looks nice
Tutorial mode available

CONS:

a)	No communication from developers (Or responses that aren't even remotely mentioned)
b)	Bad translation in-game
c)	Bugs are unanswered for
d)	Developers are avoiding community questions or are VERY selective.
e)	Crosshair dot is still bugged since start of the game (mentioned over 331 times)
f)	No public available roadmap
g)	Game is slowly dying because all the cons that are unaddressed for
h)	Randomized spray patterns? What the actual hell.
i)	As a new account, the tutorial is WAY TO LOUD!!!!!
j)	Why isn't Black Squad or NeoWiz using a main source of information spreading? Now bits of information can be found on either twitter or discord, not user friendly.
k)	What is the grenade launcher doing in competitive? It’s breaking gameplay.

Well, time to bite my nails and wait for Brian to make another Tac Reload meme. #FML

--- REVIEW END ---

--- COMMUNITY QUESTIONS START ---
These are a few things that EU players want to have fixed and / or information about if it's already known or not. These questions are based upon EU region and are uncategorized.

1.    Any plans on doing something with the feedback given to you? If so, how are you going to show to the community you are doing something with this information? 
2.    Why randomized spray patterns?
3.    When is there going to be ESL support?
4.    When is there going to be a practice mode with unlimited grenades and spectator mode?
5.    When is there going to be a ping limit in EU Ranked Clan War matches?
6.    How are you going to fix the net limiters or aren’t you aware of people net limiting to get peek advantage?
7.    Is there going to be a map pool available you can choose from in Ranked Clan Wars, so you can practice the map with your team?
8.    Any plans on sharing your road map with the community?
9.    Are you going to hire more people to help with programming, network code, visuals and PR?
10.    Are you going to fix the DOT crosshair, so it scales with given “size” in-game?
11.    When are the hit sounds going to be fixed? 1 shot in arm/shoulder is headshot sound, etc.?
12.    Is there going to be an ELO system for Ranked Clan Wars?
13.    Are the smokes going to be fixed so it’s not turning when you turn your camera? 
14.    Are you going to add basic RCON commands like swap, restart, kick?

Again I'm sorry for your negative experience, again please submit your suggestions/reports/ questions to our Support Center, where there is a large team that can help you and all other players. Thanks! http://support.blacksquad.com/

My response 16 November:

My fault for not editing the post that my error got fixed on the 9th of november. But still it's remarkable that a lot of questions are unanswered for. It seems that the developers don't have a clear understanding about where to funnel information to or from. Since twitter is being used to promote the game rather than talking "" real time "" to their player base and discord has a discussions and feedback channel which is getting overrun and hard to maintain. I'd suggest removing "" Send messages role"" from these channels and tell your playerbase where to post their suggestions and feedback.

Side note: Since 4 days I have the 0x000005 error (can't connect to server, stuck in EU server limbo), which is aswell unaddressed by the developers. (last tweet, 22 okt about biggest update, nothing after that.) PS: The 0x0000005 error got fixed for me on the 9th of november 2017.

--- REMOVED DUE TO OBSOLETE END ---"
19376,hi iam balance
19377,"They need to improve a lot of things, when you shoot someone player looks like having a seizure, a lot of people cant get in EU server for 3 days and keep counting, still no explanation or fix. You cant get skins easily even with money. They are giving impression like they care money more than development. If the game develops for better gaming experience, like removing flinches when you shoot someone or server problems its a good shoot and run game."
19378,"Sooo.. Just download this game again after about a year of not plying, and I have to say it is still old good Black Squad :D

For me this have give me good moments back in the day when I played it.

In my opinion this game is great for people that have low spec pc or no budget for buying game. 

Is this game worth playing in 2019? If you want to play some random game,hangout with your friends, this is great game for casual gaming. But If you want some competitive gaming experience this game is not for you.

Still enjoying this game form time to time, good luck for developers for keeping this game as long as possible."
19379,Great free to play game with a very fair free to play model. The gameplay is very good as well.
19380,"gud

19381,"Hackers, Spawn Campers, Shitty Maps! If you like all of that it's right up your alley!"
19382,"More than 300 seconds to find a server (we canceled because the counter is boring) in duo, is this normal? I do not think so..."
19383,"the most generic shooter you could play in a good way. it does everything ok but nothing horribly.

pros: 
graphics aint that bad i've seen worse
gameplay is pretty fast
skins look cool
isn't pay to win

cons:
menu is a trainwreck to navigate
no voice chat
if the other teams alot better you will get spawn trapped hard
not alot of players for a free to play game"
19384,"One Of The Best FPS Shooters Of All Time!

At First I Was Confused Because I Was Referred to This Game By my Close Friend, When He Tells me About the Mechanics, I Was Instant Veteran!

This Game Has Good Graphics and It Has a Similar Feel to CSGO and Call of Duty!

This Game Is Great If You Have the Graphic Settings Set to the 'High' Preset.

Keep It Up Game Developers!

PS: I Host Servers and I Would Like to Host a Server For This Game Because This Game Is The Best!"

EDIT: Valofe bought Black Squad and then ruined it. 0/5 Don't recommend. At least it's still better than Ironsight, less P2W.

I've been playing this game for a few years now, and it's pretty good.

The playerbase and servers might be lacking in your region though (I'm in NA region so matches are longer to find). Occasionally lags and stutters (not a hardware performance issue but a bug), but plays fine overall. It's not perfect but it's still very fun to play casually. The recent P2W mechanics have been backed off a bit after some backlash, which is good. There are hackers, but as with any free to play title there are usually more hackers because the hackers don't lose money if they get banned (given if they haven't bought anything). 

I would highly recommend this game, especially since it's free and new players get a generous starting package. Many other games make you grind for every little thing (for example Ironsight doesn't give you enough money for a new gun and attachments, which every veteran you play against will most likely be using as Ironsight does not have fair matchmaking). Black Squad's guns already come with attachments which can't be changed (which works out well as you get more stuff without grinding for hours.) Black Squad gives you enough starter currency to buy at least one more gun so you can start out with multiple loadouts tuned for your playstyle and combat situation.

The G28E is no longer so OP, as it's now like the MK11 except it has 2 zoom settings. 

Weapons seem pretty decent right now and a new players shouldn't have any problems with some of the credit weapons. My suggestions for starter guns are described below, and for some weapons I include a suggested Medals gun upgrade. You get enough currency to buy at least 1 weapon. I would suggest getting the SCAR H or a sniper over an AR as you get an AR at the start. I would not suggest shotguns and SMGs as they are less versatile because of their close range only nature. LMGs are very inaccurate, so not recommended either.

G36 is a really good and well rounded AR and is better than the S15 (so new players don't have a disadvantage). Comes with a grenade launcher and 30 round magazines, or a variant without a GL and 40 round magazines.
Suggested Medals Upgrade: M4. However you lose the Red Dot Sight which is the best optics in the game for ARs, so it may be more of a sidegrade although stats say M4 is better. Or AK74, slightly weaker than M4 but gives you RDS so it's a direct upgrade.

ARX is good if you want a super accurate laser type AR with minimal recoil, but don't mind sacrificing damage. Comes with a grenade launcher and 30 round magazines, or a variant without a GL and 40 round magazines.

HK17 is just ok imho. If you want a high caliber AR, you be better off just getting the SCAR H DMR. Comes with a grenade launcher and 30 round magazines, or a variant without a GL and 40 round magazines.
Suggested Medals Upgrade: SR47. You get a RDS instead of a holosight, which is better so it's a direct upgrade. CZ BREN is newer and even better, still has RDS.


SCAR H if you want something more versatile for short and long distance targets and don't mind losing the grenade launcher (which isn't that great imho, but gives you free permanent although weak grenades). DMRs in Black Sqaud are fully automatic and take around 3 chest shots to kill or 1 headshot. They are also very accurate when tap fired. 
Suggested Medals Upgrade: MK14 fires a bit slower, but kill with one headshot while using silencer. Essentially a direct upgrade as SCAR H cannot one headshot kill with silencer.

Blaser is a good credit sniper with one hit kill capability as long as you headshot or have a slightly injured enemy. Bolt action so every hit must count. Cannot be hipfired easily.
Suggested Medals Upgrade: Barrett. A bit slower, but 100% one hit kills to head or chest. Essentially a direct upgrade as Barrett is the most reliable 1 hit sniper.


Dragunov is good sniper if you want something a bit faster than Blaser but still keep a somewhat high probability on a 1 hit kill even on the chest although it will happen less often as it has slighly less damage than the Blaser. Slow semi automatic is more forgiving for less accurate players. Cannot be hipfired easily.
Suggested Medals Upgrade: G28E. It's not exactly a direct upgrade from this weapon though as it's weaker but faster firing. This would be a sidegrade, and you may still like the Dragunov.


MK11 is good if you want to quickly and aggressively snipe, particularly in shorter distances where time is more crucial. Fast semi automatic is very spammable in very close quarters in a panic (anything beyond that will miss). You'll find much more often you need two shots to the chest to kill. It can still be used long range however and kill with 1 headshot. It does quite a bit less damage than the Dragunov, but more than the SCAR H.
Suggested Medals Upgrade: G28E. You gain an extra zoom level, which improves extreme long distance usability. Essentially a direct upgrade as extra zoom is great."

19400,nice game i like it im a dota 2 player and i want to play new games then i saw this game playing my brother then i try so its good its like csgo :P
19401,This game is very good.
19402,"Run of the mill free-to-play shooter that plays like a weird mix of CoD and Combat Arms. Snipers are overpowered (think pre-nerf AWP from CSGO but even faster peeking and no counter-strafing needed), but surprisingly, the guns are *relatively* balanced. Definitely certain guns abused more than others, but due to the game's handling of high damage weapons and their relative fire rates, no one gun has overpowered DPS from my experience. The game is very generous with its currency system, with most weapons being permanantly unlockable.

I suppose since this is one of the least cancerous F2P shooters I've ever played (with a generous currency system, which is a huge plus), with fast-paced gameplay, it honestly could deserve a good recommendation.

tl;dr free CoD but very low levels of pay-2-win BS, also overpowered snipers"
19403,"Great f2p fps, could use more in game items to purchase but other than that is very fun game"
19404,super game :)
19405,Nice Game but sometimes lag
19406,The best free FPS multiplayer online game. I haven't played Black Ops 2 but have heard from other gamers that its very similar to that. I recommend this game. Black Squad rocks!!
19407,.
19408,"This game is for broke kids who can't afford CS:GO...

It has the same bullshit marketplace we've seen a million times in every other asian fps clone, nothing new here... just a graphically outdated, boring rent-a-gun, uninspired, CS:GO ripoff with a wallet vacuum microtransaction system.

This has all the hallmarks of shitty eastern f2p fps's and brings nothign new to the table. 10 years later and the fps scene over there hasn't changed a bit. Stay classy Asia.

Every match is identical, there's only like 2 death noises, everyone just throws grenades fucking everywhere, botters, uninspired map designs, a few of which are stolen straight out of CS, Some guns have so much recoil and spread they shoot bullets sideways, meanwhile most pistols have no recoil and 2 shot everything. Everyone is either a kid or doesnt speak english so you have your choice of underdeveloped or unintelligble insults.

But mainly just throw fucking grenades. Be sure to die as quickly as possible so you can get more grenades..."

19415,"If you like Call of Duty, you will like this. Now this game isnt perfect but is any game perfect? As a game developer myself, this game is a game for any indie developers dream. I donot think an indie developer made it but the did a good job. The graphics are fantastic, the servers are very good. Now it does have its problems, Like it crashes in the middle of the game, visual glithes and so on. But trust me It is a very good game."
19416,"I've never rated a game before, but i had to after just an hourish of playing. This game is a mixture of Counter Strike and Call of Duty. That said, its a fun mixture. In my hour of playing i killed 6 people in under 4 seconds, sniped and got sniped from obscure angles, and even did a 1v1 knife fight. The engine and the game are fun, the pay to win is kept to a minimum, and cheaters are removed almost instantly. Definetely a good game worth the price"
19417,"amazing and fun
"
19418,Fun Game! Want to level up your steam account! Add me :)
19419,"This game is just outright awful,
As a new player joining the game every person who has become familier has their camping spots and thats all this game is.
Whoever gets to the window first gets the first shot and its GG. Snipers own the map not worth useing any other weapons.
Disappointing. Really wanted to like this game, Mechanics are pretty solid."
19420,"Great game, many map options and game play..."

It's a shit












Nah it's pretty good with knife wars ;)"
19422,"This game has it pros, its balanced and yeah no pay to win, but the gunplay is unbelievably boring, there is no recoil its just spray. I couldn't find myself enjoying this for very long with knowing how many better f2p fps games there are already this game just does not stand out."
19423,Free FPS

19430,Good game to chill after csgo with Russian gopniks
19431,A really amazing f2p game. It is a tiny bit like CS:GO only that this game is much better. I really love that they didn't go for the p2w system. It makes a lot of good games unplayable. But in this game you only need skills. Really enjoyable i can't wait for full release. Respect to devs.

- Free to play

19442,"This game is all around alright and pretty fun. You will not see p2w anywhere so thats good. The game play over all is so generic and over all awful. Its a spray and pray game that repeats itself in every match you play. Sniping for one is the most horrid thing ive ever seen. The snipers are usesless and slow . Reload times in this game is a joke. I recommend other games such as csgo.  

This is by far not the best free to play shooter as it claims to be.
Rating this a 7/10 for that its free to play no p2w and good servers. The rest is downright awful"
19443,its awsome
19444,"just like they say, this is the best f2p fps on the market in my opinion. just try it, its free."
19445,"Free to play FPS with about zero P2W ! 

+ all weapons can be unlocked with ingame currency
+ weapons aren't too expensive  [unlocked about 8/10 of the shop(~100h playtime)]
+get a high damage rifle (ak,sr,) accurate rifle (m4,s15,etc) and a sniper (Dsr,m107) and you're good to go
+ only 2 blatant hackers in over 100h playtime ( never saw them again)

-too many bloody noobs 
-no  MM balancing at all? ( maybe there is but if so it's trash)
-waiting time can go up too 200-300 sec searching a battle match in EU


Cashing players can get themselves weapons and Exp/gold  faster duo to boosters and skins in the shop but even your stock weapons are pretty good as everything in this game is balanced pretty good (except the assault class *cough*)

It's FREE, it's NOT P2W , just try it out.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update: Queue times  are much better now, max. of 60 sec for any mode in EU and much custom lobbys"

          -Harder to connect to servers not always enough players playing
          -Lootboxes (They got to make money somehow tho)
          -Not enough rush B

Verdict= Poor mans csgo
"
19451,"[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ No Pay 2 Win. Only things you can buy with real money are cosmetic items. (Weapon skins, characters, cards, etc.)
+ Arcade gameplay. Feel like a generic shooter but has CoD aspects.
+ Nice graphics.
+ Nice soundtracks.
+ Variety of guns, Spray gun, Tap god gun, semi-auto sniper, 1-shot-kill sniper, pump shotgun, auto shotgun, etc.
+ Boobs physics on female characters ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
+ ＴＡＣ ＲＥＬＯＡＤ

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Confusing UI of most menus.
- Some maps have confusing and uninteresting layout.

[h1]Maybe Cons[/h1]
- I'm playing on SEA server and it pretty toxic. 65% of games, I saw ""LOL NOOB"", ""NOOB TEAM"", ""PUTANG INA MO BOBO"" at least one time per game.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
It's fun and enjoyable. I'd recommend if you're looking for new online FPS games or you're bored from CSGO, BF4, CoD and want to try something new and simple yet fun."
19452,very good gam to pla wit uer punts dovn

19456,it's okay i guess
19457,it;s quit good
19458,It's like Crossfire but has Better graphics D.O.P.E 8\10 :))
19459,the game is awesome 9/10 the community is awesome the potential is there the anticheat os battle-eye the gun play is amazing the characters are awesome but i do think there should be  character customization more maps wouldent hurt as well and MORE GUNSSS!!! maybe a few more gamemods like idk zombie survival or mutant mode somthing like that but the game is free and there is no pay2win sh*t you can only buy skins for you're guns and thats it                                                             good game lets keep the positivity going and the devs rly listen to the community GG :D

19462,"This game is probably one of the biggest reason i havent bought csgo yet.

PRO's
>Good graphics
>Good mechanics(kinda similar to CS:GO)
>Huge selection of weapons (even though most are losely based on the real one)
>Great server (they claimed it has one of the best netcodes)
>All weapons can be bought for FREE using ingame gold currency which is fairly easy to get

CON's
>Some maps can be quite simple and boring(though its my personal opinion)
>All weapons and player skins except some knife skins are only available by using real 
 money(though thats the only way for the developer to earn money,and i think we should buy them 
 to support the developer)

19464,The game is like a copy of Special Forces 2 but better when it comes to graphics. but it still has more room to improve. The sensitivity is Shit and you cant do anything about it.  i like the game it's just that i hate the sensitivity and why the hell does it have A Present 1 to 3 when it comes to sensitivity when we only stick to 1. for no ill give it a thumbs down.
19465,"Play this game while its good and not ruined/plagued by crybabies.
If you have ever played the old f2p FPS games like Combat Arms, Crossfire etc., this is that but much better. Hit sounds are very satisfying. Skills (in specific game modes like Destruction) are unique and fun to use.
CSGO players will like the usual demolition mode (boring!). 
Destruction (or Battle Match) is where i get the most fun.
Easy to earn money and buy guns. Smooth game. Runs well on low end.

P.S. Since Patch 11, the matchmaking is taking very long for me (south east asia region). Before that, it always took around 15-40 secs to find a match."
19466,good
19467,"This is probably one of the best F2P games ever. Especially for a shooter. Games like 7 days to die have so shit graphics and decent gameplay for the cost of a high price, for such a trash game. This is like a combination of every single shooter. COD, Battlefield and CSGO. I wouldn't say its better than CSGO and Battlefield and some COD but its a combination. If you started to get into pc gaming and you didn't want to waste so much money on a computer and don't want to pay so much for games. I'd make you start with this one. Its very optimized and you could prob play from a 2010 computer and get good frames. Although players take like 10 shots, its a very good game especially the graphics. Most F2P games have shit graphics and shit content because they feel they're never gonna get far and thats true if they keep thinking like that. But this company did a phenomenal job. Thats why it has so much positive reviews."
19468,"""Protected by Battle-Eye Anti-Cheat""  what a load of crap that is.  There are so many cheaters in this game it isn't worth playing.  I tried my best to enjoy it, but in the end, there is no point in even playing a game if everyone isn't playing fair.  No way to report cheaters so they can cheat with impunity.   Don't waste your time."
19469,"Well all I can say is GOOD BY CA forever HELLO BLACK SQUAD
For an early access it's very good and fun game"
19470,"Tried three games, feels like CoD. All run and gun, or embeded campers. This isn't a tactical shooter at all, this is more spray and pray. Small maps, even on sniper games, matchmaking of ""You need a game, here's a game with two dozen experienced players, you can handle that after doing the tutorial can't you...""

The game itself is good for a spray and pray type, terrible as a team strategy game. 

Nobody talks... nobody gives a **** beyond their own stats. 

There are pro's though. It looks great for a fast paced FPS, and is well optimised. The community in the short play I tried as an unresponsive melee. 

All this game proves sadly is that we need another Ghost Recon or Rainbow Six game that isn't poor. 

My recommendation is actually a ""Meh"" depending on your taste, for me it's a no though."

19506,Worth of try!
19507,"It's a good game, but it takes very little skill. Like a mix between Counter-Strike and Call of Duty. 7/10"
19508,Join any match and get owned by higher ranks.
19509,Big problem!!!! So one day i woke up and tried to play but the game failled becuase of battle eye launcher and i went on the website and i tried every solution it listed and non would work pls hlp
19510,"Great game, love it"
19511,Yet another F2P shooter with real money shop and awful graphic. Don't play this
19512,"This game is so awfully made i do not know where to start.....
from graphics to loadout to gameplay to texture filtering......
I knw that this is a free to play game butthat is not an excuse for shitty content.
there is so many free to play games that are much better than this one.
WARFRAME
WARFACE
SKILL SPECAIL FORCE 2
NO MORE ROOM IN HELL

downlaoding a movie would have been more amusing at least woul'vew had an hour ot two of fun unlike this all it took was a few min to know how bad it truely is............"
19513,"Did play it for 38 hours.

Liked it.

Then, all the sudden, for no reason, I can’t open it anymore.

It’s been MONTHS.

Still can’t play it.

I’m not the only one according to all those forum trying to find out a solution to this issue.

But here’s not real solution “beside format the computer and install windows again”

Seriously?

Fucking fix it already.

Fucking ridiculous.
"
19514,game shit
19515,"Bottom line: Avoid this game. It's Free to Play for a reason.

JAN2020EDIT: Devs are simply getting greedy. These last few patches have done nothing but hinder the game. You now can't see how many times you died in a match. What? How about the network issues, and game breaking bugs? No, lets just change a UI element, and add a ton new cosmetics. I understand that this is a F2P game, but it's only went from bad to worse. Now most of their ""competitive"" tournaments are ran by random people, and support has only gotten worse. The gun/gameplay in a nut shell is about at the CSS level, but there are a ton of weapons that can simply instantly scope and 1-hit you above the waist. If I wanted to play instagib, I would load up Quake.

OCT2019EDIT: Holy crap, this game was great in 2017, but now it's been driven into the ground. I do not recommend this game currently.

Fast paced competitive shooting that has absolutely no pay-to-win that is fantastic for the price.
This will be edited as needed, with edit notes being below.


[h1]After 400+ hours in this game, streaming, uploading videos, and spending hours acquiring data, this is my honest review of this game:[/h1]

MAJOR EDIT:
This game is not to be taken seriously/competitively with issues with latency.

[h1]Pros:[/h1] 
[b]-No pay-to-win.[/b]
[b]-Free-To-Play[/b], but doesn't suck. Seriously, this game plays like a mid-tier first person shooter almost on par with CSGO and COD.
[b]-New guns/equipment can be acquired quickly through normal gameplay.[/b] No grinding for a week for a new gun, you'll have one in an hour or two.
[b]-Fast Paced:[/b] Compared to other AAA competitive shooters, the action is fast and hard.
[b]-Large Variety of Weapons:[/b] This game has a gun for everyone! Guns for Sprayers, 1-Tap Gods, No-scopers, whatever playstyle you have, there is a gun/knife for you, and it doesn't take long at all to get!
[b]-Positive Community:[/b] Most players you come across are positive, you can easily find people to add and play with.
[b]-Hit Registration:[/b] Unlike CSGO, I've never had one instance of a shot I know landed not register.
[b]-Global Support:[/b] There are servers being released often, and support for you to play normally with servers around the globe! Definitely give this game a try if you don't live in an area that is usually supported by game developers servers!
[b]-Multiple game modes:[/b] There is a game mode for every FPS player! Team DeathMatch for the COD players, Demolition for the CS:GO players, Battle Match for the Battlefield players, BOT TDM for casual players, and Assassination for the awesome players. There is even a PVE mode they have released for Halloween that is a true challenge, and might even stay in the game!
[b]-Holiday Events:[/b] They gave skins out just for playing the game during Halloween, introduced a new game mode, and implemented a lot of new items during the holiday update. I hope this trend continues!
[b]-Community:[/b] Unlike a lot of other games, this game isn't toxic as hell. Even with random strangers, most of the time you'll have have a good time. The discord is almost always popping with players discussing the game, looking for a clan, or challenging one another. Beware, people still get salty!

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
[b]-No voice support:[/b] You need Discord or another program to communicate via voice.
[b]-Netcode:[/b] This works both ways, the greater your lag, the longer it takes for the server to register your shots. If you go up against a lagger, he will have a slight peek advantage on you. If your ping is in the 300+, you will suffer, but there shouldn't be an issue with servers all around the globe.
[b]-Early Access:[/b] Now, I'm not going to complain because this game is free, but it's not perfect. I've not run into anything game breaking during my gameplay, but just keep that in mind.
[b]-Hackers:[/b] I have 250 Hours in this game, and I've only ran into ONE hacker/cheater during a battle match. In all of my competitive gameplay, I've never observed, or went against any cheaters. People do cheat, but it is rare in this game. Anyone that says they run into hackers all the time most likely aren't used to the game, or don't play on a higher skill level.
[b]-Boxes/Crates:[/b] These can be opened by spending Real Money to buy bullets. Bullets is a currency in Black Squad to open boxes, and to also buy exclusive boosters, epic player models, and more. There are a ton of different boxes in Black Squad, so you know exactly what you will get when you open a box. Want a legendary AK-47? You can click the box and know exactly what you might get. Usually they contain an ""epic item"", such as a rare skin, and all the other prizes include gold, medals, BS coins, and sometimes, even lower tier skins. All the boxes, except for one, require you to pay, and everything inside is purely cosmetic. The only box that you can open for free have exclusive knife skins that you can only get by spending gold to open. Some people get lucky, others do not. This is for you to decide.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]-Uninspired maps:[/b] Most of the maps aren't that great in my opinion, they release new ones nearly monthly, but some of them are just...awful.
[b]-User Interface:[/b] The main menu sucks. The friendslist/chat gets in the way of anything on the right side of the screen, you cannot chat in the main menu screen at all, and some items you can double-click to quickly navigate, and other buttons you can't! Why? I blame this on early access, but this goes down as a con for me. I enjoy my efficiency!
[b]-Lack of a competitive scene:[/b] Yes, this game is early access, but the only way to find ""competitive"" players is to either get lucky on a clan match selection, or find a team on the official discord. There are clan ranks, but no one takes them seriously right now.
[b]-Matchmaking:[/b] There have been times where I've went against a team of 5 when I was by myself for 3 rounds before other players connected. This has happened when I've went solo, qued with a team, or just randomly jumped around. The game will TRY to match you up based on rank, but after 30 seconds, it will just throw you with whoever is on. Doesn't really happen in the competitive gamemodes, but if you play assassination, it will happen a lot.
[b]-No report system:[/b] Early access, I know, but if someone is being really toxic, or is cheating, the only way you can report right now is by posting a video on the discord. It's better than nothing, and the mods actually do their job!
[b]-Currency:[/b] There are 4 different types of currency in this game: [u]Gold[/u], which is gained just by playing the game and given as a daily log-in reward. Gold can be used to buy most guns in the shop, and is easy to obtain a huge amount of it. [u]Medals[/u], which is gained every 7 days as a login reward, and is gained every time you level up. It is used to buy guns/knives/characters from the medal shop. (There are two shops in this game, more on that later) [u]BS Coins[/u], which is only gained by opening boxes. They can be used to buy different skins, compared to just winning them from a box. Finally, [u]Bullets[/u], which is the currency that can only be bought using Real Money. You use these to open boxes, or to buy a special model, or EXP/GOLD booster. I spoke about boxes in my Neutral section of this review above.

 If you're broke and want to try something new, give this a try! You get free currency just for doing a quick tutorial, and if you look in the DLC section, you can try almost every gun in the game for free for 15 days! That is more than enough time to amass enough gold and guns to supply your own Black Squad. Give it a shot, and feel free to hit me up at IGN SL4DE. Happy Fragging!

(P.S. I spent a while writing this review, a thumbs up would be appreciated! <3)

EDIT1: Formatting."
19516,"Nice game overall.

Needs new maps, bigger maps and different kind of maps with new mechanics.
It would be good if you could choose your sight, even if you have to buy it.
Prices are fair and absolutely no Pay 2 Win.
Matchmaking is a bit off but you will get paired with people with your skill 90% of the time.
0 lag, balanced weapons and really entertaining game modes."
19517,Good I guess if you don't have any money to spend on a non F2P. It is pretty much mindless shooting but offers fast paced gameplay in short length games so you don't have to spend a lot of time in one session.
19518,"I really enjoy this game. If you want a FPS that takes elements of CoD and CSGO, and puts them into a F2P game, this is worth checking out. Might not be perfect, but I mean c'mon it's still early access. Play it, and take it for what it is. It is still a developing game. It has great potential. It runs well on my old toaster laptop, has fun game modes, and balanced guns, cool maps, so I vote yes for Black Sqaud, despite its minor flaws."
19519,"WORST MENUE LAYOUT EVEEERRR. But decente game. Offline practice is just enemy models that do nothing. Also, the menu is worst then you think."
19520,"If you are a FPS,Squad/Team based FPS fans should get this!!

Action packed,Realistic recoil,Awesome Gunplay,perfect game to just chill and get those kill streaks.

So this is more a first Impression than a review. First off I have to say this game is a LOT of fun and have a decent amount of maps and game modes. The gunplay is SOLID and weapons feel great,huge weapon variety and recoil definitively play a big difference between guns. This game and devs should get a lot more praise and recognition then they are getting. Their Free 2 Play model is something us gamers should really cherrish,since it's something we don't see much of in 2017. There is absolutely NO pay to win elements in this game (something other dev's should take note from). BUT... There are some issues: It is often hard to get in to a game/game mode you want,so more often then not I just end up selecting a random match just so I can get in to a match. I think the Free 2 Play marked has gotten such a bad reputation over the years,that people are vary of f2p games and rearly even bother checking a f2p game out. It's sad but there's so much garbage drowning out the few gems,that it's really hard to even start digging through the pile in hope of finding a good one. This is one of the F2P GEMS,if you are a fps squad/team based fps fan you owe yourself adding this to your library and trying it out..You will NOT be disappointed. I think the devs wanted to prove that it's possible to make a good f2p game with out all the p2w aspects,and I applaud them for it. BUT.. I think they could perhaps get a higher player base if the game wasn't free (maybe charge $3-5) and then make money on weapon/skin packs like they already do or something similar. I really think going payed might be worth trying. I also think they need to promote this game a LOT more,get streamers and youtubers to play it,make deal with Twitch personalties (not necessarily sponsorships) but yeah..more promotion needed.  The Dev's definitively set out to create a good funtioning game,over making a mediocre cashgrab game. If I would guess this game is for sure mafe by gamers. So far I give"
19521,Great Game!!
19522,launcher is too small need help i cant play
19523,"Great game, indeed not p2w, but also well balanced

If you want a specific item/weapon, DONT waste your money at the beginning, pro tip
Some weapons cost 120k gold, and you earn 1000 per match (ouch). Earning money is easy though, just do the missions and log everyday, costs nothing and easy. However if you want to buy a lot of weapons, you gotta farm for hours, (not a good point) but it's not neccesary.

But it's a free game, so i think that's normal  to farm a little if you don't want to pay anything. And the farming is way easier and faster than the other free games
Moreover, play with friends, that shìt's boring alone"
19524,"This game is pure ♥♥♥♥... I know it's early access but still...

Brilliant start. Well, when i first got ""recommended"" this game I thought it looked quite decent. Reports on it being completely not p2w gave me hope that this game would keep me entertained for hours. But then i played it. First match in, I realised that this was not what i hoped or expected it to be...

The weapons where suprisingly balanced, i haven't raged just because i was obliterated by this one op machine gun. Also it was not p2w at all, it only encouraged consistant logins (which is fine, beter than farming for hours on end with no prevail and the only way to stop your suffering was to buy in-game currency with real world money). Also the netcode, which the developer, NS STUDIO, boasts as being ""amazing"" is quite that. Amazing. i never would of thought that games like this could have decent netcode. But the positives end there. 

The maps... Jesus Christ, the map design is awfull, complete ♥♥♥♥. At the start of every round, everyone, whichever lane they're going to, lobs the grenades over to the other side, killing some and inguring all. The grenades are not even the worst. Some maps are biased to the opposing team, giving flank routes that other team don't have (because normally, in games like this, the maps are symetrical, kind of) and better cover. In some cases, you are forced to change your weapon type based on what map it is. This is just not right. If someone wants to snipe then let them snipe. Don't make the map consist of no sightlines and millions of crates just lying there to simply help camper scum and block the sightlines.

It is just another generic shooter, out to make some cash. The animations are crap [although i do like those boob physics ;) ] and the graphics are that of a 2014 game. Also, the gameplay is ♥♥♥♥♥, i can never understand when to ADS or Hipfire and the lack of sprint in a game like this really pisses me off and holding a knife to go every so slightly faster is not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sprinting. (i know it works in csgo but thats a slow based TACTICAL shooter and involving lines like ""TAC REALOAD"" does not make it a MILITARY SHOOTER)

You like sniping eh? Then you've come to the wrong place. Go fok off back to mid of de_dustII and awp innocent CTs whilst they're trying to escape their inevitable death. In games like this, there is no reason that you should not be given a one-hit-kill sniper right from the start. It's not op as it rewards good accuracy and headshots are a pain to get in these games. Instead you're foreced to buy a 1 hit kill sniper from the store which costs 135,000 gold (the in-game currency) that is 9 days of CONSISTENTLY logging in, just to get a sniper.

This is not all the problems but I've been typeing for quite some time now. DON'T get this game. It's a waste of your time. I would highly reccomend Warface over this. (atleast that game has some unique game modes.)"
19525,"please develop this game for mac please
"
19526,i just started and im playing with p2p players wtf how the fuck i would win with this shitty gun and first of all the sentivity sucks and how character moves make me sake i rather play sf 2 or csgo than this shitty game
19527,Great game that still requires polishing.Generally the maps are original and Gameplay is good
19528,"A casual fps game that is f2p, some guns are locked behind BS coin that you have to buy box and be lucky to get them but otherwise the rest of them you can basically earn enough to buy them from gold/medal shop since the nicer looking one are basically skins for some of the guns. Same for the knifes, normal looking one are buyable from medal shop and nicer looking one are those either you get lucky or spend enough to get them.

If you going to complain about game having microtransactions, cs:go have them, overwatch have them. As much as I don't agree with games having microtransactions, some people like having their stuff look nicer which is understandable, whether you want to test your luck on trying to get nicer looking weapons or not, it's your own choice to keep yourself in check so you won't be drowning in tears when you spend 100 bucks and didn't get the weapon from the box.

There's also server for you to choose from, don't be stubborn and play in a server that you have high ping on and complain that you kept playing on high ping, choose the server closest to you god dammit.

Would I recommand getting your friends to play together? Sure. Either way there will be people that make you mad because of some questionable choices they made. If you don't have cs/cod, you can try out this game.

[spoiler] Salt and cancer will hit you even for a person like me that play casually and suck[/spoiler]"
19529,One of the best games I've played in awhile and for some reason it's free? I would've paid $49.99 for this game no joke. Who would ever imagine that a free game could top cs:go? Well it's looking that way everyone! Join the fun!
19530,"good on graphics but i really do not recommend this game, it's half baked, even the sensitivity of the aim is poorly made that i have to switch over to 6000 dpi just to get my aim correctly when i just normally use 2400"
19531,"The game is plagued with hackers, the blatant ones who rack up 40 kills with all head shots never having to reload with no recoil. There are also speed hackers  and few other more exotic varieties of cheaters. For to common to take the game even remotly serious.

Other than that it is a CoD/CS rip off. It has even more annoying perks, gernade spam, rocket spam, bunny hopping, campers and the rest of the cancerous grief that comes with it. There are also a lot of lag issues and very high ping (200-300+) in all games.

"
19532,The only PvP game I am good at. Would recommend. 10/10
19533,First FPS where its not pay2win and spending money has no benefits except cosmetics. Great gameplay and devs listen to the community. Girl charecters are worf.
19534,"100 bucks but no best skin. wtf 
Game is ok but is not worth spent any bucks on it
So I spent $300 on a skin and then the skin 30% off first and then 50% off in 3 months.
???????"
19535,"Recommend for FPS junkies.
Not recommended for rage-gamers"
19536,"Black squad has a lot of vibes from cs go, but it also brings aspects of Call of duty and Battlefield into the mix, a great game filled with lots to do for hours, if you're a team player there is lots here for you. a great game with only a few things i would change. 8.5/10"
19537,"Fast-paced budget CS where grenades actually do decent damage

It's also not pay-to-win"
19538,Decent Game and its still early but feels good. (Y)
19539,"a game of honor, I recommend !! 💪💪"
19540,Great game make sure to pick the right weapon at first
19541,"Arcade shooter feel - cross between call of duty and a wannabe CS game.

Also should note that I'm a Battlefield player, which could be why I couldn't get into this game."
19542,great free game. id pay no more than 10 for
19543,Nope Didnt liked the game soreh
19544,Best graphic
19545,"Played Combat Arms back in the days? played crossfire? all them games? this is the closest FPS shooter multiplayer out there thats close to them games, pretty easy to get the hang of when you start! Pretty fun! much better then DIRTY BOMB because no disadvantage !"
19546,"Come back to see after I quit for 2-3 years. (since they removed Destruction mode from quick match)

This game seems to has been faaked up so bad from a series of bad decisions, in current state, I'd say it's dead. You will be waiting forever if you hope to find a match from matchmaking. (there're a few rooms here and there in custom) A lot of stuff were made into RNG model, some medal guns and knifes you can buy are no longer available, characters can't be bought aside from loot box, even normal weapons that you can usually buy with gold are also packed into RNG loot box. No new gun were introduce. Cheaters still running rampant but many do get live ban during the match. Now there are many new games in the market, you would be moving mountain if you think this game can become alive again.

It's a pity since this game has quite distinguishable playstyle from other FPS games, but incompetent devs faak all. A tale as old as game development. Just play Enlisted or CSGO."
19547,Shit game with shit lag with shit servers. Don't waste your time
19548,"Very bad game. Just don't waste ur time.

19549,i fuck with it 4/5
19550,add more guns and new game modes and workshop thanks.
19551,It's just boring and repetitive.
19552,"Good gameplay, kina funny that the first time i played, someone got kicked by the anti-cheat. My main concern is how to get coins other than ""gold"""
19553,"Boobs move when you rotate the characters

10/10"
19554,It's not Pay2Win at least. But it's the most generic shooter I have ever played. The graphics and animation are functional but the very slow movement and tiny maps along with the very high bullet damage leads to A LOT of camping. Not exactly sure what this game brings to the table that others don't.
19555,good game it is like call of dutuy
19556,Really isn't very enjoyable.
19557,"Absolute shit, you gotta buy items just to basically play the fucking game, AND IT'S MENT TO BE FREE TO PLAY. First game I jump into, there's a fucking spinbot hacker on the enemy team."
19558,Needs more improvments but like wt* its better than csgo or any othere shooter game i hope it gets better in time also you cant hack in this game wich is so good
19559,I do not know why I got out while playing. Fuck.
19560,good
19561,game is baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad
19562,the guns are shite not balencd at all
19563,When I first got this game I felt it was a combination of Black ops and Counter Strike Global Offensive. I got really addicted to it when I started playing it. If you like shooters or are a big fan of Cs Go get this game! The TDM is really fun.
19564,"Modern day Combat Arms, but way better love it."
19565,Govnina
19566,PvE is not bad and fun. But the PvP side is full of quickscopers and stupid perfect acc of any weapon. Most snap shots feel so quick that they are aimbotting. Its basically a giant S*** show of online play.
19567,"Simple and fun, maps are kinda blocky and unimpressive but that's kinda the standard for this kind of shooter."
19568,"It's a nice game as this is my first shooter game..I have to say that it's really good!
I would defently recommend this game"
19569,.
19570,"there is only one thing to say about this game : FU****ING AWSOME , damn its one of the best shooter games i have ever played in ma life , surely recommend it :)"
19571,zhops
19572,hit reg are bad and lag server
19573,Nice game!!!
19574,"This game Definitely has Great graphics if your computer can run them, but that's about where the Realism ends.
There is virtually no weapon or character customization at all. the feels like a CoD campaign with the focus for counter-strike weapon skins. Not the typical ""tactical"" shooter in the sense of the word as in both pvp multiplayer and pve missions 1 headshot even with high caliber guns does not kill unless it's a sniper. Not a bad game, but i can't recomend it if you want more than a flashy fps Cod/CS clone."
19575,"This game is an absolute, I am about to reach 100 hours of game-play, it has the best game mechanics and the best match-making system with custom matches, you are able to make your own servers!!"
19576,Not bad though
19577,"me:mom gimme 10$ i'll buy Counter striker global offensive
mom: no
me:ok
I also know a mentally unstable handicapped child that only plays and dedicates all of his time playing this eventhough he has csgo rainbow6 and pubg
11/10 would play again"
19578,Poor man CS:GO with no salts and no Gaming computer required
19579,Basically CSGO but free
19580,"Very nice game, just that grenades cannot throw really far."
19581,"Black squad is a multiplayer or single player first person shooter. The game is hard to get use to at first, but once you put in the time to explore the game, you'll get quite attached to it. It's free! So download it! I'm pretty excited for the Biggest Blackest Update on October 28th."
19582,"very good for a free game 
"
19583,Great Game
19584,Nice alternative to popular FPS games. If you are looking for a revolutionary change or have high standards set already look elsewhere but if you are looking for a change and are patient this game can get you hooked.
19585,sucks ass
19586,"To  me this game is great. 

The gameplay works perfectly fine to me and it doesn't lag or anything.
There's quite some weapons and the updates keep bringing in more of them.
It's pretty fun that you can open up a certain box which gives you a chance to get a skin for a knife, for only in-game money which you get from playing, so no real money!

You can still buy more points to open crates for a chance to get a fancy weapon skin, but even though this is the only way to get a skin, it's ofcourse completely optional.

Overall, i think this game is very good, the updates keep making it better giving it alot of potential to become a bigger game.

I would really love achievements in the game though, it would give it a more challenging touch.


Pros:
*Great graphics, looks like a game you would pay for.
*There's no lag depending on where you're playing the game from. (i have no lag, i live in the Netherlands)
*The weapons are cool and it doesn't take much to get them.
*The game is very rewarding, when leveling up you get a certain kind of money which you can use to buy guns, or even knives like karambits.

Cons:""
*It sometimes takes quite some time to find a game with enough players. (around 2/3 minutes.
*There's no way to test the weapons you're about to buy.


I definetly reccomend this game.
It's free, so why not give it a try!

19592,"the game play is good, the problem is the server. after the last maintenance I can't fuckin play the game, can't launch the game. need  a lot of improvement"
19593,good
19594,"This is a very casual shooter. I couldn't find any reason to get upset about it. It's pretty fun for what it is, but it's so painfully generic that I find myself only playing for around 2-3 matches. It gets pretty stale when you play on the same map for the umpteenth time.

I recommend playing Dirty Bomb over this, it has much more character and is a lot more competitive."
19595,"similar pb/ava , not pay to win"
19596,"Love it, but one problem is I want to play it on the mac, the graphics is like real life and I just cant stop playing it"
19597,my girl friend left me
19598,Please put the drop down options on the top of the screen or allow us to change the size the launch menu because I can't access the drop down menus because its literally below the window and I can't reform the window size etc. SO PLZ FIX
19599,"This game obviously tries to be the next CS:GO, which I really appreciate, because I don't wanna deal with the toxic community and the scammy skin business over there. So I gave this a go.

First off, the [b] gameplay feels great [/b]. The weapons look great and really have some punch to them, and the hit sounds are just music in my headphones. The gamemodes are fun as well: Quick TDM, CS-style bomb mode with 5v5 or 8v8, a fresh new VIP mode (where you either attac or protecc an AI VIP) and the ""Battle"" (haven't tried that one yet).

The Free2Play aspect is well implemented, making you earn enough ingame currency in free play to still be able to buy new weapons and grenades every once in a while, and it's not an absolute pain to save up for a new gun. Thumb up for this one. And if you wanna spend money, there should be enough gun skins etc. to keep you interested. :b

[u][b] HOWEVER: [/b][/u] One thing that really annoys me and that's essential for a multiplayer online FPS like this is the matchmaking. As all players join the round and load the map, it's still open who's in which team, and this gets assigned when the round starts. And here's what sadly happens way too often, this example taken from my latest game in TDM: There's 4 really high-ranking players (you can recognize by their level icon) and the rest of the players all vary between complete noobs and guys who at least have a few hours in the game, like me. [b] How difficult is it to split the 4 elite players 2 and 2 into the teams? [/b] Instead, my team got absolutely slaughtered, because all 4 of them were on the enemy side. We played on a small warehouse-like map and they were besieging our spawn so hard that any of us died as soon as spawn-protection wore off. That is just [b] horrible [/b] matchmaking/balancing, and really needs to get fixed.

In summary, I'd still recommend this game. I had a lot of fun so far, and it's refreshing to have such a variety of guns available, and to have 3 loadouts to customize and freely interchange between rounds. I'm definitely gonna play more of it, and recommend it to my friends as well. And since I believe in the whole Early Access thing, I'm sure there's gonna be a lot more content and fixes coming our way, so the game will one day perfectly achieve what it aspires to be."
19600,ok game till they changed it very dumb guys
19601,This game is if csgo and cod had a baby
19602,Basically Call of Duty and CSGO Mix. Works Well. Really Fun.
19603,"After the new update , i feel soo bad..its cant runn...when the map was loding. then the gmae close ..
"
19604,Very nice Effects! Nice kill sounds!
19605,"Blacksquad is what we all want in a F2P FPS game. In depth guides, dedicated servers, real weapons that actually work they way they should, fun leveling, (Grinding is actually fun here!) In my personal experiance this game beats most FPS games on the market. Dont worry if you're not good at fighting other players, they have an AI bot selection with NPCs that actually know how to fight.

Now for the bad things:

If you dont have a rather powerful computer lag may be a big issue for you.

Sometimes the ingame friend menu does not respond and you have to try it multiple times.

Since their newest update you have to revalidate your game files in order to play the game or else you will only get a Error Maintenance [3] [7]

Depending on where you live and what time of day it is, servers may be slow and unresponsive.

All in all, I'd give this a 7/10  all it needs is to smooth out the lag bugs and some extra server support and this could rival CS:Source in its prime"
19606,custard
19607,"to be fair, this is not a bad game. it's most like CS mix with COD...
so the bad stuff I hate about CS is here, the predictable recoil pattern...
you really need set the sensitive above 15(my DPI 1600) to control the gun.
or use a MACRO...witch is cheating.

other then that, personally I think most the maps are over designed.
it's very hard to pre aim if you aren't familiar with the map, they're not very big, but it's complex still...

the pay 2 win aspect wasn't so bad, after the tutorial you can buy one permanent gun.

last, the FOV only support up to 80 witch is not enough..."
19608,i have 32 bit and i cant play
19609,"XDDD

19610,Oceanic servers pls
19611,good~~!!!!!!ㅌ XD XD
19612,"The latest update is having many bug , sometimes you cant choose your class in the event mode , and many people said that too difficult to win the game (the PVE event) , and the there are many problem about the transaction of the Chinese . Howeveri think this could be the best free FPS game on the market"
19613,nice game!!!
19614,"Pretty good game one of the best free fps games ive ever played so keep it up
"
19615,Really fun and lots of team work on other game modes but if your feeling like rushing team death match is is a good place to play without thinking to much
19616,"this game isnt the best, but it is still amazing for a free game i would recomend if youre steam wallet is empty but if not don't get this game. like insurency or rocket league there really cheap but again get it if you have little or no money on steam."
19617,This gameplay just like CS..better to play
19618,"UPDATE 7-1-21
going to check this out again. valofe is now starting to get tough on banning. more to come...

UPDATE: still not good. still full of cheaters. still declining population. full of trash.

was very fun... now full of hackers. auto aiming and everything else. they are ruining the game... just like all the OTHER games."
19619,Cheap mans call of duty... but it's suprisingly fun. With friends it is a great game but when playing solo it can get quite repetitive and the grind for new weapons is certainly a flaw.
19620,"Looked promising but too many quirks right at the start.
Issues with controls and an apparent mouse  sensitivity issue that prevents you from even completing the tutorial.
Basic look and feel was a 4/10 (TripleA titles mainly getting a 6+)
Did not expect great graphics but was ok for what it is.
Unfortunately, since I could not get past the tutorial stage due to control issues, I have to rate this game a 2/10.
Dev does respond with a ""fix"" for this but  it requires setting your sensitivity to default and frequently, from what I experienced during tutorial, hit and hold f1,2,3 to ""reset"" it.
Solid base but shakey execution.

Rating: #/10

Graphics:  3/10
Controls: 2/10
Multip:  ?/10
sp:  1/10 (tutorial only)
cost:  8/10 (Takes into account cash shops)
prospects:  4/10

conclusion:
If you can get the controls to work it might show some promise. I am NOT uninstalling but I will wait for an update to see if this resolves any of these issues to give it a fair shake at a later time."
19621,a 1/10
19622,This game is worth of your time if you like playing fps the good thing is it has no PAY TO WIN you heard that right everyone is on the same page skins do not help just cosmetic but people here keep saying oh it generic it boring it basic JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP if you have issue of the game then uninstall and never download it jesus GO PLAY YOUR P2W SYSTEM GAMES fuck off
19623,"I would like to add mini games as hide and seek as in cs:go greatly improve the game

19624,ITS GOOD THAN CS:GO
19625,"There's a huge Brazilian problem on NA servers. Everyone has 200 ping and only speaks Portuguese, with no in-game auto-translation function. There's only one solution to this problem, and it's region-locking servers based on IP address.

EDIT: Well, US (East coast) is officially dead. It's borderline impossible to find a game, regardless of what mode you queue for. You're forced to play customs by either west coast or EU players. Even west coast servers are dead most of the time. You're better off not bothering as a US player. It's still a fun game if you like customs, but you aren't gonna get any event currency. If you do find a server, no one's speaking English. RIP USA community.
(Worth mentioning EU servers are still lively, though, so if you live in the EU give the game a go. It's still fun.)

EDIT2: Update. General consensus seems to be that the game is dead in 2020, if you ask anyone who isn't a zealous fanboy for the game. Which is a shame since I was hoping to give it another try."
19626,"игра топовая,но много чего можно переделать в лучшую сторону,например: хорошо бы выбор оружия увеличить,еще лучше сделать раздел внешнего вида как в ""Argo"" , сам выбираешь внешний вид,включая мелочи типа очки,повязка,рюкзак,ботинки и т.д.Разнообразия карт не хватает! Но в целом игра очень хорошая,советую всем поиграть)"
19627,"Still needs some work to make it a good game, but the basics are good"

19633,Competitive FPS where grenades are hidden behind currency farm.
19634,very similar with cod
19635,Such a refreshing FPS game :)
19636,"If you are not into cheats and hacks, just forget this gamethe devs fully embraced hacking and actually support it so complains will most likely get you banned.
MOST of the players in any given battle are hacking. That's the reality.
If you think this is crazy, go to YouTube and see for yourself how easy it is to cheat in this game.
Remember that most players can see through walls and smoke and they have auto aim.
A battle is decided by the amount of hackers in each team and not by quality of team.
The devs accept and support cheaters so if you are not into cheating, play other games.
Just a tip, if you are in the lobby and someone asks you what server do you play on, don't tell them, they are using a hack to kick you out of the game (yes players are ""allowed"" to use that hack against someone complaining about hacking).
According to some, the devs not only embraced hacks as they actually sell them.
As i said, if you are a loser and want to feel ""better"" about yourself, go to YT, watch the reviews on the several hacks for this game and go foul yourself into thinking you are a ""great player"". The  hacks won't get you banned so you don't have to fear.
So to finish, this game is dead and the devs support hacking.
If this is your kinf of ""thing"" go ahead and enjoy yourself."
19637,it's fun and most important it ain't pay to win and lastly it's free to play :D Love it my csgo escape :D

on the game add voice chat improve the matchmaking to be skilled base q and a lot more instead of keep making skins the game will never be competitive"
19647,this game just to fuckers
19648,"Ive been playing online games like this since medal of honor first appeared, got really big into COD4 and then the trail went cold. The COD series of games following COD4 were no where near as good. And until Black Squad arrived I felt I was missing out. Im no ninja but this game is very very good. Love the graphics, anf different game style options, the weapons & sounds are brilliant. I would really like to see bigger maps dedicated to sniper only games, like COD2 had. IE a non crossable map with about 15 players per side, nobody else does that now."
19649,Pretty Lame.

19656,"Game is great, but something is lacking. Something every part of the world has, except for Australia/Oceania. If we could just go without 200 ping I'd play this game every day of the week."
19657,Worth while to kill some time. Decent amount of guns to start with. Hope they keep it up
19658,"No wonder it's free, CS was better even by old standards in every way. It was fake as all heck and the Graphics are not something to enjoy. The game mechanics are really really bad omg like COD and CS mix. The  Grenades sound like distorted speakers and the explosions well my gosh no words can describe. When you shoot soldiers on the tutorial they react the same for every bullet that hits them. I mean good try but saying No ""pay to win""  is a joke considering you can buy booster packs ???. I bought Battlefront for $6 a while back and that game was so much fun. This game better be free as it was not even close to being fun."
19659,"gooooooooooooooooooood
"
19660,"Its  a ""Okay"" Game guns are good, sounds are good.. Its a ""eh"" game for a free to play BUT ONE DAMN thing about this game is the maps... GOOD LORD THESE MAPS ARE SO SMALL IT TAKES YOU AT LEAST A HALF OF A SECOND AND YOU'll ALREADY BE AT THE ENEMY's SPAWN POINT.. If this game had much larger maps it would  be a perfect free to play game"

19663,"Ok, i've got 1k hours on Alliance of Valiant arms, which i REALLY enjoyed playing back in the days, was in one of the top clans but clan went extinct due to poor leader, This game is similar to AVA, dont be fooled by the bad reviews of this game it has its flaws, like underbarrel grenade launchers which are kinda annoying but give opportunity to get rid of snipers hiding behind corners. Most of the reviews are based off of players who have played this game for <1 hour / 15 hours at most and the only matter these reviews touch is non stop grenade spam and grenade launcher spam. That happens only if you play annihilation (TDM) or against AI, Grenade spam doesn't happen on demolition, cos people dont have grenades to throw and they could be used in a better way such as nade spots to kill rushing enemies. I give this game a strong 7/10, has its flaws such as unbalanced GL attachment, Silencer on everyweapon is overkill. walking is good as it is, just get rid of the silencers on 3/4 of the weapons. 

TL;DR Game is good, play it first, but dont play TDM (nade spam)"

19670,"Games just full on dead, if you do get a match it's with hackers, (and I'm not talking someone better than you, someone spinning in a circle a billion times a second and headshotting you with a pistol across map). Anti cheat has been fully defeated by groups, the only reason people get banned anymore is mass reporting or some random forums admin seeing a video of a hacker and (maybe) banning the right person. This ends up with a constant gamble of doing things like competitive matches, cause if the other team hates you enough, they just get their clan to spam report you, it's common to see ""win=report"" in anything in competitive. There's a lot more free games out there for your time."
19671,The game is not that great..... But it is fun to run and gun ! Fun to play when you dont have time for a full match of CS and you want to get some frags in before you start your day.
19672,"Old:

Pretty decent. The skin and weapons system need a bit of a rework such as guaranteeing a skin in payed boxes. Needs a matchmaking system where you only play with people of your rank and not high ranking people with customized blazers.

The main problem is that the servers in North America are high ping, there's no voice chat, and matchmaking is ridiculously long.

Updated 5/2022:

They've fixed most of the major bugs, main thing now would probably be making the performance as good as possible"
19673,pretty good

19680,"Thats a great gaming has a potention, look this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POHqvEm711w"
19681,"This game was free and I still want my money back. There's really nothing unique or redeemable about this game. It's a straightforward, nothing-doing military FPS. The game is incredibly laggy even with good internet, and sometimes you'll teleport at random and get killed/completely miss. Everyone in this game plays the same exact way, not that there are too many opportunities for different playstyles. The maps are too narrow so there's no dynamic. It's just two teams bumping heads until one wins. Every match. Black Squad also centers around the ""plant the bomb"" mode we've been playing since CS Source.

This game offers literally nothing of any value to make it at all interesting or particularly fun. If you have to get an FPS, just go for CS: GO, which this game is the freemium wannabe version of. CS: GO is not that expensive."
19682,the blazer r93 has a spelling error in the description.
19683,You can't complain much at a free game. They update small things a good amount and you are able to get everything in game just by playing. Skins are the only items you can buy that cost real money so its not a pay to win game. Rewards for playing the game and logging in help when trying to get weapons that cost medals. Not perfect but is reccomeneded if you are looking for a good free FPS.
19684,"Not impressed.  I've played it on day one, excited for it, and while the opening was really cool, it was just kind of meh.  No offline mode, no campaign and no bots.  Just a free to play mp shooter that looks and acts like Call of Duty.  I haven't been keeping up with the game so I don't know if any things changed."
19685,"It's alright for free... I guess

Reminds me of cs:go"
19686,I spent about 100 hours in this game. For a free game its not that bad.
19687,"preeetyyyy goooooddd for an early access game but the main problem is with servers they take a minimum of 30 sec.

in quick match to find player and some more time to load the game and map so yeah we cant wait we are impatient people please fix that and make sure that you guys give more shotguns....

other than that no hackers have been found in asia server coz i am usually playing on asia server and whenever i played i havent seen anyone cheating because the battleeye anti cheat is way too good...than vac ban

i totally recommend it mainly because....

its 18+......

its 12+.......

its awesome.......

its multiplayer........

players are not noob....

did a great amount of minute detailing.......

and its too good than battlefield 3 which basically has no multiplayer servers of its own...

I have played loads of FTP games FPS games and i know how to spot a hacker and i cannot belive my eyes not one person hasent killed me without some sort of hack. Im not supprised because its a Free To Play game but this is the worst i have EVER seen its un bearable i want to love this game but i just cant way to many hackers dont waste your time with this ship FTP FPS"
19693,havent played much. but if you play FPS shooters this will be super easy. most guns have little to no recoil. movement is fluid. unfortunatly most guns are not temporary. there are many types to choose from but they only last certain amouts of time. unless you pay for them. you make in game money slowly. like a couple K a match and most weapons in the market are 150k and up for the better ones

19705,gud game
19706,"Pros: -Fun
         -No P2W
         -Not many toxic players in the community
         -Gold and Medals are made quite easily (You get Gold from winning / losing a match I think, and you get Medals by leveling up)
         -Weapons are balanced

Cons: -There's always that one Sniper in your team that either camps the whole match even after the enemy planted the bomb or just dies instantly because he/she goes for noscopes / quickscopes / close range combat
          -The matchmaking is pretty shit, since it will mostly have you on teams with lower levels who play worse and the enemy team is basically full of highest level players who are pros and most likely get you a bullet in the head right after you go through a door
          -No report button for reporting hackers / griefers / trolls etc.
          -Buying crates with Gold will most likely earn you a Frag / Smoke Grenade (this really pisses me off, I'm not buying a crate until they make grenades a lot less common)
          -A few hackers
          -Getting kicked from a match on a EU server because of high ping even though I'm in EU

Pretty good game, no bugs / glitches and can be enjoyable with / without friends, it just needs a little more work."
19707,good
19708,lol
19709,Game is so shit. not even worth a try. it's like a flash game...nvm it IS a flash game
19710,It's really fun. Kinda mixes Counter-Strike with Modern Warfare. I really like this. Nice community too. Haven't found any toxic players (Yet anway) I admire the fact that it does not try to be so unique. Most of the time when people try this with thier fps games it flops. This is just a solid FPS expiriance that's F2P. Also this optimization is great! You can run this at more than 60 fps on anything! I would recommend this if you're looking for a new and fun fps game to play :D
19711,"Wasted hours into this game. For an unknown reason, it seems addictive to me. Try it out. Maybe you would also like it and enjoy it."
19712,"basically this game is the best alternative for cs for people who cant afford it , this game is really good with a wide range of mods,weapons and skins and the best thing is that its free , i rate this 9/10"
19713,"Can't recommend. The US population seems so small for this compared to europe and asia and as a result you get people in your lobby that lag like hell and shoot you through walls..cause the devs thought 'favor the shooter' was such a great design decision. This game doesn't have penetration like COD but hell, you could sure fool me, seeing the amount of times I have ducked into cover and been shot or even HEADSHOT through full cover because Mr. 300 ping still 'saw' me out of cover.

Combine that awful netcode with the rampant hack problem that Battleye most definitely did not solve and it's hard to play this game as anything more than for a joke. Don't even think about going competitive because there are way too many factors at play that ruin any semblance of competitiveness. Dying not because of my screw up but because some kid with mcdonald's internet or someone half the world away got thrown into your US lobby (yeah, the game grabs people from outside your region if it can't find any..fantastic eh?) is a whole new level of frustrating.

How I managed to soldier through that nonsense for 14 hours, I don't know..but if I ever do play this again it's to do dumb shit like charge at someone with a knife or suicide run rambo-style..cause anything else is likely to be marred by their awful netcode that favors the lagger.

Edit : To put it in perspective, I'm getting 34 ping while facing a pile of 150, 200 and 300 ping people that are most definitely not from the US region. All cause they refuse to put in a ping limit."
19714,this game is so awesome <3
19715,"Needs a good amount of work. Apart from that, its pretty good for a free-to-play game."
19716,"....Installing Game...

19717,Can't sell my skins that I bought anymore. Utter Dogwater
19718,"as a person who has played this game since it came out in 2017 here are the good and bads of this game:

The Good:
1)nice graphics
2)Decent sniper mechanics
3)new maps with every other update or so
4)custom rooms

The Bad:
1)TERRIBBLE hit registration
2)HORRENDOUS UI
3)quite bad map design for 75% of the maps in terms of balance
4)HACKERS
5)terrible weapon spray mechanics
6)you gotta buy nades in game currency
7)Skins are literally impossible to get for the average person without buy tons of loot boxes
8)No basic offline functionality
9)weapon price inbalance
10)no audio slider for the headshot sound so youre constantly getting ear raped 

Conclusion: This is a mediocre game that can provide decent fun but without a doubt in my mind there are certainly better alternatives to this game such as csgo.

- there aren´t any pros about this game, really

[b]Cons:[/b]
- hackers
- bad servers
- no fun (for me)

This game is boring. You could rather buy CS:GO instead of wasting your time with this game.

[u]0/10 it´s just bad.[/u]"
19721,"No SEA servers.
As I'm at SEA, it's important to play at the nearest server to achieve lowest ping as possible, sadly this game doesn't have a SEA servers, rendering asean players unplayable under any circumstances. Really hope they add it soon."
19722,This game's gunplay is so watered down that it could give COD a run for it's money. Takes no skill to get a kill. It all boils down bullet hose vs bullet hose.
19723,+
19724,"Things to improve in Black Squad
1) Translations. Right now it is very cheesy and just bad
2) More loadouts. I have sniper, smg, rifle and would like to have 4th loadout for shotgun for example
3) Map layouts. Some maps are just frustrating and dont make sense in gameplay
4) Customization in general for free to play and preemium players
5) Menu looks messy and ugly overally
6) More gamemodes
7) zombies or horde mode would be awesome
8) commands sound bad
9) More interesting progression with rewards. Medals does not motivate
10) More maps, weapons, characters etc

Hope game improves otherwise slowly dying"

19726,how can i change my user name of the game ?????
19727,It's a very easy to play free fps. It looks great thanks to the team at Neowiz and all others invested.
19728,its a great game but the con about it tho is there is no open mic chat if you added the micrphone headset it ould be even better the guns are good it would be great if it could be controller applied aswell but the overall of the game is still needing to weed out the bugs its a great game i recomend it
19729,"MM system is joke,you can be afk as long as you want noone cares you can't even kick it,nothing to do in this game atm i don't see anything good exept item microtransaction"
19730,"well this game is good,what's wrong if this game copy CoD or CSGO because this game want a poor gamer who dont have money to buy CSGO and CoD to play and feel it.Anyway cool game bro."
19731,"get it now this is going to be the next c.o.d :) loving it so far
hope they dont rek later this is a really fun online fps"
19732,"GOOD GAME TO PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS :D ,
6/10"
19733,I like this game and i feel good when i play with my friends.
19734,"Please put a Server for Middle East players.. we connect to asia server but still our ping range 300-400+, and that sucks for a fps game."
19735,"Hopped into this after Ghost In The Shell : First Contact announced the server closing. RIP that game.

TL;DR this is probably the trashy free-to-play fps shooter you're looking for.

This game is like CS:GO with ADS (aim down sight). Quick time to kill,  mostly small close quaters maps with the special battle modes (destruction) providing larger maps more appropriate for sniping / camping. All weapon content is immediately availible to buy permanently, if you like the game and grind naturally you'll probably have all the guns you want in 1-2 weeks. There's even two free DLC packs with 15 day trial versions of (i assume) half of all the weapons in the game each, which I reccomend activating one at a time and stretching it out over a month. This can help you when deciding which weapons you want to buy permanently. The game even starts you off with enough to buy one of the gold guns permanently, read a steam guide on weapons before you decide so you don't waste your money. There is very little content that requires you to spend money, couldn't be happier about this. I reccomend spending some money on 2x exp / 2x gold, it's cheap and the benefit for new players is immense. 

If you're a TDM / demolition player the tutorial will mislead you about the nature of the game, there are no classes in the those modes, only for the strange battle modes, which mainly operate with 16 v 16 players trying to break the other teams boxes. Strange, takes time to grow on you, never quite feels appropriate. Luckily you don't have to play those modes.

My only complaints are: 

- That the battle mode in unintuitive and weird, two teams pelt eachother with ovwerpowered skills while trying to destroy the other teams boxes, luckily this is all optional.

- That ranked is linked to clans and is really quite stupid if you think about it, just doesn't work satisfyingly and doesn't give you a way to throw yourself into serious matchmaking without clan organization.

- I was going to complain about there being no female characters but one is coming on the 25th of October.

"
19736,"Eh i liked it at first but then it kinda got boring then the servers were compleat trash, i recomend this game if you are very bored and just looking for a half decent fps game to play."
19737,"good shit
"
19738,"It's ok, the shotguns are fun, feels a bit generic though."
19739,game bad
19740,since the last update I cant play because it says select server first. Yet there is no place to select server from. GREAT update broke the game at least for me
19741,Very good game with big gongas
19742,one of the best f2p games out there
19743,it's a good game. i love it!!!
19744,that is best better good game smooth clear best guns all it so repect game i love it
19745,NICE Game
19746,if grenades are permanent it would be better xd
19747,This is one of the best free to play FPS games out there imo.
19748,"Game graphics are somewhat wierd but gaem iz gud. Could have been better evironments and competitive gameplay.
7/10"
19749,"Good game, hip fire accuracy needs a little nerf. But the game is free so no one can really complain.

This is pretty much a solid version of AVA for those who have played it.

Would recommend as its free!"
19750,"nice game
"
19751,This game is COD on training wheels. Just hold w Shoot and reload. Clunky slow movement. Spend your time somewhere else.
19752,"hahaha played at 500 ping and won with 31 kills
A real competitor for csgo"
19753,It is a good game. It needs work.
19754,"Pretty much CSGO.
Aids when you're in combat as your player has about 1% health and whoever gets the first shot will always finish you off without you giving a chance.

Only play if you're level-headed and don't rage."
19755,This game is the best game in the fps market.
19756,"its a good game it just needs updates
"
19757,"i dont know i cant play the game i need 64bit but the game is 32bit please see to fixing this or if i can play in 64bit plz tell me 

- Eco932b
"
19758,"Love this game, simple to play yet unless a cod or csgo play you have to build that skill.  CSGO and COD players I'd say it's a great place to practice if your interested in any of the later it's a great place to see if you like the format.  For me it's been an awesome experiance has become my go to game not just for the game play and the exp to git gud for other games like the earlyer said, pubg and even Fornite BUT a great way to relief that stree pressure free of stats and no pressure to do micro transactions while there being opions to buys fav weapons and cards (still not sure what they are for) and nad's (and something about bullets I don't yet understand) while not loot crates, pods or containers in site (yet) just good old grind for metals and gold.  Ending as I started I love this game as so hope it gets the attention I thinks deservers in the US.  Also hope they don't screw it up on the way to full release or take to long to add maps and other things to make/keep it fresh"
19759,This is great because it is better than Warface. It is not laggy and  it is fun. I don't have anything else to say but I want you to get this game pronto. It is free.
19760,ห่วยแตกเกมส์ก็ไม่มีระบบรีพอทเจอแฮกก็ทำไรไม่ได้สมจริงก็ไม่สมจริงควย
19761,"pros:
- battleye
- feeling

cons:
- every game u start with -1 ammo in magazine. (you have to always reload at start game, total retarrded)
- shotguns are total shiit (2x head shot and still no kill, pathetic) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ2So7WMR1I
- bunch of retarrds dying becouse running and switching primary weapon and knife like in cs;go
- few ""in game currency weapons"" and tons of ""weapons for rl cash""
- cs;go copy paste audio things
- bad programming (u hear rain, make 1 step to building and instantly no rain sound, pathetic in 2017)
- quick match works like total shiit (most times u enter to game where your team is almost lose becouse when ppl losing they just leave and quick match system put you for thier spot [there is no way to set: start only new matches])

NOT RECOMMENDED at this moment, if something change i will edit my rewiev.

/edit/
it keep getting worst, they add pink hair outfits. bumper flashy weapons.
every couple weeks there is some useless patch providing total nothing.
no future for this game, next crap"
19762,i will be more better if you have voice chat
19763,"This is probably one of the best free to play games ive tried out, already bought the founders pack and spent a bit money on this game to support it(got the coolest looking AK skin)
(the only thing to spend money on is weapon skins this game is not pay to win)
everything that effects gameplay is given to you by playing the game
i highly suggest everyone who likes CSGO or COD to try this game out
its like a mash up of both games 9/10"
19764,"pretty good free to play the currency system is a bit unforgiving but other than that its easy to learn and play and all of the rifles weather it be sub machine gun or assualt rifle do around the same damage even if they are payed weapons so thats a good balance, graphics are really good for a free to play shooter and game mechanics are unique"
19765,"Awesome game. Free to play normally means you need to spend in-game to get somewhere, not with this one. Highly recommended as a more relaxed version of CS:GO."
19766,GOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
19767,This game is dope
19768,Mechanics are shit
19769,"It's just another one of THOSE games that on their ads they say ""Best free fps game of all time best year best gun best ping"" so. Don't bother playing it."
19770,"good game, gets boring after awhile"
19771,"This is the most balaced fps game i have ever played esp the guns and chars. Easy to get familiar with easy to learn no complicated mechenics. This game is just the freaking best fps i have ever come across.
Try it i gurantee you will not dislike."

19775,THIS GAME IS LIT!!! NO RAGRETS!
19776,"Bot mode was kind of fun but the bots need work, the AI is rediculous."
19777,"I have played this game alot on my other account and i can say it's a gratefull game
I like the mecanics , i like how you can shoot even trought a screw hole and all i can say about this game is :
If this game was like 5$ or 10$ it would be almost as played as h1z1 now, or csgo , smth like thiis.
From my point of view this game is better than csgo because the comunity is less toxic and here are no mic-spammers etc.

19778,BEST GAME 2K17 SAVED ME FROM DEPRESSION.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!! !!! !!!! !!!
19779,Not a bad game at all as a free fps
19780,not bad at allc fun game
19781,LOVE IT NO PAY TO WIN MAKES GAME A LOT BETTER THAN OTHERS.
19782,"Is it my network?
When i run i get teleported al over the map."
19783,"trash ass game, play it just to unistall it later
boring game, full of nonsense controls and shit mechanics"
19784,Pretty decent game. its youre casual fps. Probaly one of my favorite free fps's
19785,"I dont have to move my mouse once i find the height of sombodys head...i can just click when i have a good shot.

Needs alot of work but good game"
19786,"Amazing FPS for a free to play game. However, I would like to see more skill elements in the game. Even if you are moving, it seems that your weapon's accuracy is always 100%."
19787,"ITS FREE!!! But besides that, with every update the game gets worse. You shoot and guess what you get killed by a headshot from a person not even aiming at you. As a matter of fact I've been killed by someone backing into me as I unload a whole clip on them. If you want to smash your mouse get the game. Then again it has a ton of potential and the graphics are good for a free game. Can't beat free. Its a very fast paced game that you have unlimited lives in if you can stand getting killed 100 times by the same camping sniper. Its also nice when you start a tdm game and half your team think they are pro snipers on the smallest of maps."
19788,"This game is one of the best F2P shooters on the Steam Store. It's good fun for the most part, though it isn't perfect."
19789,">Downloaded Black Squad
>Joined the first match 
>Been killed 20 times with a grenade
11/10 would be killed with a grenade again"
19790,Pretty sassy good!
19791,"What do you get when you mix Call of Duty and CS:GO together?

This game.

9/10

Honestly the game isn't P2W which makes it great as all weapons are affordable after grinding for not THAT long. Some of the best assault rifles you can get right away and the best sniper after a few more hours. 

One thing we need - OCEANIC SERVERS then it'd be perfect."
19792,"IP Blocking is required. The amount of lag in this game keeps it from being a satisfying experience. Allowing users to join a server where they become a drain on everyone elses experience, is not a good thing.

8 gamers get into a room and 6 or 7 ready up immediately, then wait 1-3 minutes for the others.

IP blocking by geographic location can be done, and if you want the user community to be happy, you will."
19793,"Decent game and free to play, There are pay elements too speed up getting guns but after around 4 hours or 3000 kills you will have enough credits to buy any of the top tier guns, Really is no need buying credits as one of the setups they allow you to use at the start, the SMG is one of the best guns overall.It just suffers at long range like any SMG. Any of the HK,AK,RG rifles are the what you are aiming for. I like how they've stayed true too the supressor aswell and not reduced it's damage like most games do to balance it for you not being shown on the HUD radar when a shot is fired.

The servers are good too, Using a auto kick feature for anyone with a high ping keeping the game a enjoyable experience with minimal lag if any at all.

Map size are small compared too even Call of Duty but it's a quick combat FPS so plenty of action all the time. A bit of variety since i started playing they're was only 4 maps and now they have added a new one aswell which is decent So it does look like they are actively developing new content. 

As for microtransactions like most F2P games yes you can spend money on skins or gaining certain guns/equipment but honestly no need like i said above within a few hours you should be able to obtain the rifle you want.

Actual graphics of the game decent nothing spectacular.

6/10  only thing takes off so many points for me is the map size honestly this game with big maps would be a blast."
19794,GG
19795,"Apparently I have 1.4 hours in the game; I launched it and it crashed steam instantly, I relaunched steam and it says I am in game still (After killing steam in task manager). I think little of it, shut down the PC and head to bed.

Queue a few hours later, boot the PC up, go to download some work stuff and find it wont complete the download, then I notice my anti virus won't connect. I boot steam and lo-behold it says I am playing Black Squad again, how? I had turned the PC off, how and why would the game even launch again without me doing anything but signing into steam. Not only that but killing steam still doesn't kill the game, there are still a couple of steam process that throw access denied when trying to close, including the process to the game. 

Booted in safe mode and deleted this crap, issues resolved."
19796,"Came from Combat Arms by Nexon. Also from Line of Sight. 

Gotta say that I absolutely love this game. It's a modest Free-To-Play FPS that has a nice level of skill required to do well. Each gun isn't obscenely OP (AHEM combat arms) and  the community is relatively nice. There aren't any crazy glitches or gimmicks (LIne of Sight). Hackers get banned and shamed mid game (Battleye Anti-Cheat). 

Good FPS to kill time. Not many people playing though. Can barely get a game at night.

Still fun af"
19797,"This game has potential to be a great FPS game but cheating/hacking reporting system needed to be more robust and efficient. What I have noticed when patches are made for Black Squad plenty of high kill rates players stopped rushing the map to kill opponents. Most cheaters and hackers started adopting the use of slow peeking, slow walking and actually do try to avoid getting hit by flying bullets. When the new hacks overshadowed Black Squad Battle Eye Cheat system the common hackers with high kill rates starts doing their BS thing all over again. One shot, two shot kill joy. Black Squad has to improve by way of letting other player or players to capture Hacker's game tag and report to your security team. These people are ruining the game. Black Squad will surely loses its legit  players just like Combat Arms did."
19798,n1
19799,bad game all around
19800,pretty good
19801,"i cant even open the game, when i clik play the hud dissapears and made me think when does it launch and it doesnt at all"
19802,its very fun to play with friends and mess around.
19803,Complete bs
19804,"Boring CoD/CS:GO clone!

Timed weapons...
Small Maps... with base raping...

...poor..."
19805,Not a bad FPS to play when you're bored.
19806,"A few maps suck

Better gun mechanics than CSGO

Can ADS

Runs well

Some symmetrical maps

Balanced

Not pay to win

Free

Higher pings than I see on most games but mines usually the lowest with decent internet connection

Uncapped fps

Currencys arent hard to get

Default guns work well

Nice community

If you liked CSGO I think this is the remastered version"
19807,Its very good for being free i would expect this type of content to be $20
19808,"boring gunplay...
boring game..."
19809,"i have played this game and enjoyed it a lot to get away from games i already got tired. the gameplay is solid even if at times can feel cheap, both getting kills and getting killed. headshots can happen pretty randomly and sometimes bullets won't go where you thought they were supposed to go. nothing new to a csgo player. i even spent a bit of money on the game and really regretted it: i didn't get anything from it. i spent 5$ and got zilch, nada, zero. save yourself the trouble and don't buy anything from it. the problems didn't stop there. i then moved to a different pc, where the game decided that it didn't want to work. i contacted support: i was promptly ignored. i contacted them on twitter: even more ignoring. well, you got my 5$, are you happy?"
19810,I would writ6e a review but the game wont fucking work!
19811,"At the moment, one of the worst free2play shooters.
Positive:
Works well with mobile internet
Negative:
Everything
 And developers show that they did it on purpose. After playing 10 hours you will understand this. I do not know why, I just can not understand. It's a brain drain.

Skill does not solve anything. Everything is decided by the weapons and the team. Standard weapons kill enemy with 15 bullets, ak or g36 with 4-6. Are you serious? First I played with the score 1: 3 after buying ak in tdm my score became 3: 1.
 There is no auto balance in the game. Every fifth game I play 2 vs 5 or 3 vs 7. In addition, there may be afk. The selection of the team is simply terrible. The 4: 1 score will not help win. I remember how I lost to TDM with a score of 51-12-18. The chance of a good team is 1 to 10. I'm not kidding. You will just be humiliated and humiliated. 

Also in the game there are some bugs that sometimes will not give to play."
19812,"amazing
just amazing"
19813,"I'm unsure what I should start with in this review; I suppose I should make note that the controls did not feel very nice, an example being that the default way to sprint is to hold to equip your knife to move faster by clicking the mouse wheel. I couldn't find a way to toggle crouch instead of having to hold it and the default aim down sights is toggle instead of hold, but that is easily changed. Could have a bit more detailed/advanced keyboard mapping option but it's no big deal.
The gameplay itself, well just look at my play time. It instantly felt like the bad elements of both CS:GO and BF:Hardline jammed into one game. I couldn't even finish a full match it was so bad. I was constantly quickscoped and it felt like some people had either aimbot or just absolutely remarkable accuracy and I can't exactly place which it was. Anyway, it's not exactly my cup of tea and I don't imagine these elements would make it most peoples' either. I feel that improving small details such as time to kill (which is currently not the best), increasing ADS time for heavier and powerful weapons, adding actual sprint, and maybe leaning would really take the game in a better direction. But currently it doesn't feel like anything unique by any means. Pick up if you're into quickscoping and CS:GO like combat, avoid if you're into more tactical combat styles like Siege."
19814,"sexy
"
19815,This game is pretty good and runs smoothly compared to other FPS games I've played. It's nice that you can permanently unlock weapons rather than having to rent them all the time. Most of the maps in this game are pretty good and fun to play. Some of the smaller maps are no fun at all.
19816,"really good game
"
19817,one of the best f2p fps games right now 11/10
19818,"Played literally 1 match and I instantly liked the game. Sure the servers are a bit tipsy at times, this game has it all. It really is a great game for it being f2p after all, I expected it to be a pay to win counter strike nexon-like piece of crap. Turns out I was completely wrong.

7/10"
19819,"I personally would have loved to have had a single player campaign or something eqivalent to Payday2 wherby you can lock out the public and learn to play accompanied by AI characters until you feel ready to join MP. This game has great potential as I have over 300+ hours whilst playing off a different PC and under a different game tag, so do not be fooled by my lack of hours on this PC.

I wish this game allowed you to play with AI team mates just like PD2 sadly though I uninstalled this game a while back as I am fed up of the cheaters who have ruined this game solely because they are naff at this type of game; if you want you cheat to win then urinate off and set up a server that will only allow cheaters like yourselves to join and leave us genuine gamers to enjoy the fun of this game!

### DEVELOPERS ###

Why not consider including a SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN as a more effective Tutorial before joining LIVE SERVERS?

I will await the final retail release of this game before I go into further detail as it would be grossly unfair to the developers to slate them when this is a work in progress!"
19820,"So my first review, here goes...
I have put in just over 21 hours into the game over a week or so. And i can say i enjoy it! Don't get me wrong though, there are a few things that i am finding annoying.

PROS:
1) I like that if you purchase a weapon it is perm.
2) Armour is standard throughout. No upgrades (As of yet).
3) Weapons seem well balanced, no real OP weapons out there.
4) Maps are reasonable well designed. No real easy way of bottle necking.
5) Like the custom game feature, no having to scroll through loads of rooms if you are just looking to get involved and don't care where!

CONS:
1) Seems to be a bit of questionable play, but i find this with alot of FPS games. It does seem however that the ban system is working through it.
2) Grenades are not perm?!
3) Need more maps! 21 Hours of play, and i am starting to get bored of the maps.
4) Map designs, think they could be better, they aren't bad! But could be better.
5) Custom game feature, some times takes a long time, if not fails, to find a game!

I am hoping over time, more things will come to improve the game, and the Devs will take on board what people are saying, i will continue to play the game in that hope!"
19821,"Good game but im really annoyed that there's no restart game option, i messed up by buying random boxes now im poor and i get killed so easily because i have no good weapons and no money, this is unfair because i want to buy a good sniper but when i play on sniper mode there's like 20,000 blazer snipers that 1 hit you and the starting sniper is really bad because its like a 3 hit torso, please add reset game option"
19822,Game for 10 y/o... So laggy and jumpy can't even play right. Premium weapons give advantage. Pay to win...
19823,this game is fun and enjoyable except for the fact that it tells me i need to update it but it will never update.
19824,great game
19825,Great mix between COD and Cgso nice work! Still some changes to make but is a reat game 8/10
19826,"After 43 hours on this game, i would say its getting boring...only 2 maps got destruction mode....
so many hackers...

oh btw...i came back to this game after a few months...i find their ""Absolutely no Pay-to-Win"" a joke.
just buy their latest char skin, with a bit of skill... anyone can become god."
19827,"Terrible sound effects 
20 years old sound of walking
basic FPS, nothing great or special
people can freely stare at your spawn and kill you there
you can't change sensitivity while in tutorial
- If you want good F2P FPS, play Blacklight Retribution"
19828,"Nope. Just no... 

I played many games like this and it doesn't match my type of play because of game mechanic."
19829,"need some security maintenance cause some hackers get in in the game and it is not really fair, otherwise, it is a good game!"
19830,not bad but takes some getting used to and a bit different to other FPS
19831,The game is alright aside from the fact that you can't ignore/block someone that doesn't know how to stfu in game or vote to kick or even report hackers. Literally just played with a low rank headshotting everyone 55/5 score in quick play battle. Pretty garbage. Not to mention it's been about a week since I wrote a ticket to support and STILL nothing. Useless support system but game is decent.
19832,good game wonderful graphics i love it
19833,This game is literally Spawn > run around a corner or 2 > kill/die > Repeat. My first match I went 28-22 in a 3-5minute period. Lame AF
19834,Dotto
19835,"This game feels alot like counter-strike and plus it's free! I have no complaints about the game, but there are sometimes unfair matchmaking whice leaves you either 1v5 or 2v8. all in all it is still a fun game that makes me come back to play it."
19836,"No 2 Screen support, game crashes and locks the pc so you have to restart when you change settings."
19837,"Players here are laughably bad. 

Will come back and kill noobs 10/10."
19838,Boring
19839,"Excellent
"
19840,Good game like CS. TDM is the best. Good and realistic weapons. Must try!
19841,"easy to play, fun, free game!"
19842,Another time killer :D
19843,Good game but it needs more maps at 18 players not only 2
19844,"controller support is needed asap, or me and my friends leave. and the travel of bullets is too long"
19845,> tons of hackers cough cough
19846,"After a couple hours of the game I can conclude that this game is in fact pretty good. Its got decent graphics, can run well on a low end pc, and the gameplay overall is actually really fun. But there are ofcourse some flaws in the game such as the voices. The voices really suck, it sounds so cheesy and just annoying. The matchmaking is quite one sided, a high rank can be in a match with a beginner, this can make it hard for the beginner to get better at the game. The game is still in early access so most of these problems might soon disapear. Overall I recommend this game for people who just want a free call of duty and have some fun."
19847,One of the best free to play fps game on steam i have played!
19848,:D
19849,Think of csgo and battle field game modes with a cod like conrtol and style.
19850,"""TAC RELOAD"""
19851,fun free to play like counter strike but more of its own game with moving and shooting and movement in general
19852,Fun to play
19853,Shit
19854,This game is very fun but does have bugs that should be adressed. If you enjoy games like CSGO this game is for you. Except it is free which makes it much better.
19855,"it's basiclly cs:go for people who can't afford it.
it's still beyond the level of a free to play game - this game is awesome!"
19856,Awesome quick action packed game - hate having to buy granades thou
19857,tutorial fucks me hard in ass
19858,it good because to play  with your friends
19859,THE BEST FREE TO PLAY CS:GO
19860,"Good game. It's like CSGO, Rainbow Six Multiplayer, and Early Ghost Recon multiplayer had an abomination of a love child. I'd reconmend it."
19861,"Not bad for a f2p.....

                



CLICK BAIT!"
19862,"Very Fun, Fast pace FPS game! Not COD quality, but it's good for a free game! It would be much better it there was in game voice chat to communicate with teammates!"
19863,I love this game. But the Game is still in EA and many improvements like more wepons and skins can be added. I would like for there to be more servers as my game can get glitchie because i live in AUS.
19864,"There is no noobie area, so get ready to be bottom fragger for 5-6 hours of grinding.
Also hit detection is horrid."
19865,"\\I SEE THE FUTURE OF 1,000 HOURS IN THIS GAME//"
19866,it's good
19867,It is a great game it is fun to play.
19868,"Early Review: 

Let's see...I only played one quick match and did the tutorial. If you ever played Combat Arms by Nexus, you'll get used to this layout and gameplay. The two games are very similar, but I'm sure the differences will be spotted out the longer you play (which I intend to do). Playing this game brought back memories of my younger self waking up early in the mornings to play Combat Arms, only to be destroyed. 

If you're looking for something like counter strike, this is NOT it. Worth checking out!"
19869,"Good game play and nice maps, the weopons are great for me especially the S15-GL, however as any game u will encounter some hackers and a lot of noobs.
the game still need massive improvements and changes, like a new ranked solo system and friends tthing"
19870,"I actually exptected to be a copy of r6s and i kinda hoped for that and got disspointed its a copy of another free to play game and its actually better than this one i am not gonna say its name to respect the owners (probally insulted them arleady but what can u do) i would not reccomend this game the recoil is supper weird u dont know if the silencer incresses the range or whatever or lowers and yeah ik its eary acces but as far as i saw its all about that one free to play game everything is weird if u are a broke gamer and have no money dont go for this game tbh search for others go to youtube to find better than this one, There are good parts aswell i had fun but that will last idk couple of weeks myb and would deleted and thats the only think i can tell about it"
19871,VERY NICE AND GOOD GAME
19872,kinda like counter strike but better i think
19873,The game modes gave me cancer. But not too bad for a CS ripoff. 4/10 if I had to pay for it.
19874,"Good Game...still developing day by day which is good..
one of The best FPS online multiplayer"
19875,Nice and Fun game
19876,best game ^_^
19877,Pay to win shit. I dont even know what i expected .....
19878,AMAZING GAME !!! BEST FREE TO PLAY GAME 2017
19879,"Although I don't have much hours on Black Squad I still think its an awesome game. Pretty well balanced and fair with good weapons that are not overly OP but still very good and effective. Looking at your CS:GO. Gameplay is like your classic FPS shooter with very minimal differences. Pretty good graphics indeed as well which isn't bad at all with all things considering. Overall a polished, entertaining and fun game especially since its still on early access. 

Bottom line if you like run and gun FPS shooters definitely give Black Squad a try. PLUS, it's free
11/10 Would Trigger folks again"
19880,★t★h★e★w★h★o★
19881,말이 필요없는 갓-겜
19882,This is one of my favorite fps games and strongly recommend it the only thing that would improve this game alot is some more dlcs and easier to play privet games with your friends on steam.
19883,"This game is weird. The graphics and gunplay are superb. The movement, gameplay, and controls on the otherhand is one of the wierdest experiances I have ever had. The sensitivity depends on the gun it seems, as my weapon would accelerate quickly on my first class but seem half the speed on the second class. The movement is very slow and there is no run mechanic, which is odd since it is using the design of a Call of Duty game and not Asia. The gameplay is odd since there is no real objective accross all gamemodes-its just kill and keep gunning. The graphics-however- are fantastic and is probably one of the most beautiful games of this year. The gunplay is fluid and every shot feels quick and not delayed-making prefire less of an issue. 
TL:DR
  -Graphics good
  -Gunplay fair
  -Movement & Gameplay ok"
19884,Terrible FULL OF SQUEAKERS
19885,It was a fun game but id prefer if you made the game able to support mics
19886,"OOF
GUD GAM"
19887,its beytter than line of sight and stable
19888,"Want to win? just take awp there is no effect of sniping, just point and click"
19889,you can't even sprint what a ballacks game
19890,"It's pretty good however i wish they would add a ban feature to ban players that exit mid-game without a reason like high ping so basically just rage quiting should be bannable for 1 day or something cause i hate those pussies that leave the game all because the team is losing by like 1 point in TDM or something and im just running around killing guys while those dicks leave and make me do the work.

other than that it's pretty good does take quite the amount of skill but once you have it in the bag you start racking kills like a god. still i hope they will make it easier to get gold and medals cause buying guns takes like 3-7 weeks  just to get a gun with medals depending on what gun.and only 1000 gold per round for being in the top 3 is kinda low i think it should be at least 2000"
19891,"Is this game controller compatible
"
19892,"the latest patches makes my game unstable , ping is high because there are no servers in Middle East , but the game is good i love it , i love it more than CS:GO"
19893,"how the fuck is it possible to to get kicked for high ping on all servers except for the asian servers and then i still end up playing with 457 ping on the euro server i kicked for having 223 how does that make sense. do not recomend if u live in africa or have shite internet
"
19894,i reccomend cause its like cod but free also that i like the gameplay and also more
19895,Fuck White People. Go black squad because they made the univers.
19896,"I am the type of person that will tear a game apart for the smallest of reasons. I hate games that don't deliver on their promises. *cough* ubisoft *cough*

Anyway some people would call this a free to play CSGO. Partially they are right. It plays a lot like the counter strike series except for the important part.

In CSGO they decided to add a bunch of game B.S. where you have to memorize stupid recoil patterns and other meta crap to be good.

So if you're a god at an FPS you will not be good at CSGO until you learn how it works. Though if you're good at FPS games you'll be able to stomp the Trash that plays this.

The fun part is people recognize each other in matches. You know who is good and who sucks. I've never been so hooked on a free to play shooter.

There is zero pay to win. It is unbelieveable. You can test almost all the guns out via the DLC tab for 15 days. You can easily unlock all weapons through in game play. Without huge major grind like games such as War Thunder.

There is no reason to spend money on anything in this game. Though you can if you want to. It is the best F2P model I've ever dealt with.

No one has a god gun or something you can't achieve within reasonable play time. Just give it a shot. I own and xbox one and have a high end gaming machine. I usually do flight simulation but this has got me hooked for my shooter fix. Beats that COD WWII beta I played."
19897,Not bad
19898,Great game!!
19899,"BLACK SQUAD > CS:GO, COD, BATTLEFIELD, WARFACE"
19900,"For a free game , such graphics .
Toxic people i guess after 5 h in ""Competitive 5v5"" matches in rest all it's okey.
Recommend."
19901,High requirements for not so good graphics cant even run properly
19902,enjoy the game but crashes waaayyy too often
19903,"Not like counter strike or other multiplayer game of that sort. You could more like relate it to call of duty and Medal of Honour: Airborne. It gets boring after couple of game session. 

Hope this helps!"
19904,"*Kicked due to high ping*

maybe get some oceana servers

so if you live in Australia, New Zealand, or any one of the various island countries around here don't bother, the game is literally unplayable"
19905,"
A pretty good game ... I appreciate the fact that it's free of charge. It's a bit copied from zula but it has much better graphics. I appreciate once again that there are many weapons in this game"
19906,"Este un joc foarte bun , foarte interesant. Cred ca voi face ceva 1000 de ore in el :))"
19907,"Why can't i recommend the game even if it makes alot of fun ? Hackers. They are currently in all bigger lobbys completly ruining the fun. But they are not your usual type of looser kid running around with rage settings killing everybody. Nope, they are running around with modified damage to destroy enemy crates withing seconds. This makes a 15 Minute game last 2 minutes. I hope this will be adressed soon, otherwise i don't see a bright future for this."
19908,"Black Squad is a military first-person-shooter game.

+ Guns
+ Maps
+ Game modes
+ Dedicated servers
+ Community
+ Graphics
+ Free to play

+/- Early Acces"
19909,"Pros-
Good community! 
Good graphics
Absolutetly no p2w.

Cons-
Smurfs are swarming in nowadays
Recoil need to be bit better
Need to be region locked"
19910,"Ez gameplay - very nice graphic
But need add more map TDM :))
Great game 😙"
19911,good game
19912,Really fun if your looking for a cheap call of duty substitute
19913,"maps get boring and not creative enough... money making is hard without buying... skins for weapons suck... battle mode is good, if you want other modes CS:GO is better. since it is free and has room for development , I give a positive recommendation."
19914,good geame
19915,I enjoy the competitive shooting skills that Black Squad brings to the table. The maps are enjoyable and it's a surprisingly a clean environment unlike some other games you play and everyone is cursing up and down because they keep dying K/D ratio is in the toilet and they know it's not their fault.........
19916,only one work Awesome
19917,"25 Hrs at the time of review.
Simple breakdown

CON:
The game in development for 3 years and it is... 
1. A generic FPS
2. Graphics and textures look dated for a free to play
3. Hit reg and hit boxes is a hit and miss depending on the ping
4. Region settings don't prevent players from other counties from entering into the match which causes high ping (200-400ping) in the matches.
5. Special combat skill system is not in place (execpt for the tutorial)
6. Battle eye anti-cheat is ineffective, just go to youtube and you'll see recent video's posted by hackers.
7. No character customization and limted weapon modifications

PRO'S
1. Free to play
2. No pay to win
3. Fast pace action"
19918,Best Free Shooter on steam.
19919,Really good game.  no ptw.  not many hackers.  nice game modes.  decent maps.
19920,"I think this is a great game- decent gun control, good maps, and good graphics, this game is awesome for an early access. While there is some pay to win- gun crates bought with real money, skill can get you there pretty easily, and the only ""grinding"" you'd have to do is log in everyday for your prizes."
19921,"The game is good enough to play for distraction I guess, but the scoring is terrible. I was in 6th place with 21-6, while the first player has a score of 24-27. I usually don't care such things but you know, I need more points for weapons and grenades plus why would I play if the best player is being chosen by lottery. This is unbelievable. Edit: talking only about TDM mod which gives points only to kills and assists etc."
19922,":O
"
19923,"I personally cant even find a simple, ""play"" button lmao. I might just be that stupid though"
19924,It's good for a F2P game. It's just a mix of CSGO and CoD. Less toxic it seems.
19925,AWESOME GAME. NOT PAY TO WIN. NEED TO START ADDING SOME NEW MAPS NOW.
19926,nice but if be a full conttelor it will be better
19927,Very good free to play game would recomend kek xD
19928,"Probably one of the best online FPS game aside from CS franchise.
SEA server available."
19929,hgfhfhfg
19930,Basically a cheap version of Call Of Dutyjust as good and fun!! :)
19931,GOOD GAME RECOMMENDED TO FPS GAMERS
19932,Very fun free to play game but don't expect much.
19933,"itz gud

19935,good gem
19936,tac reload
19937,THIS GAME IS BADASS
19938,its alright but could be better
19939,"I think it's a really good game. If I had to suggest any improvements, it would be to tighten their security against hackers. To make the sound of footsteps a bit more clearer and louder. It's a FPS beginner friendly game but I wouldn't say it's up to the pro level. I'm happy with this now. But once I get into competitive gaming, I might grow to hate this game."
19940,"Sorry, but this is pizdec"

19950,Very good game not pay to win very nice graphics for a free to play game and yeah :D
19951,closest server is over 300 ping....
19952,Have you heard about cod community? yea? this is even worse.
19953,Vetcor is favorite gun but its not the best. Make it better. Now.
19954,simply put; this game is lame.
19955,"Can't complain really over a free game.
Over and all a fun, but the maps aren't creative or original.
Would also like to see a better menu in the final release."
19956,"Valofe killed Combat Arms, Valofe will kill Black Squad."
19957,its cool
19958,its almost simliar to call of duty modern warfare
19959,"this game could have been better ONLY IF there were no hackers/ no p2w/ and weapon that makes sense, if they fixed any 1 of these 3 problems i will change my review to recommended, DMRs and shotguns take more time to kill than an assault rifle WTF, i have seen a lot of aimbotters recently that will make you uninstall this game with no regrets, p2w is absurd you cant even buy the good weapons with in game currency"
19960,Best F2P Shooter out there :)
19961,mostly pos my ass if you like playing in the  laggy uk/sa server all the time fucking can never get good ping because the morons took away server selection now your are forced to have over 150+ ping instead of 30-40 because of they decide what server you go to
19962,"[b]Very Fun Game [/b] 
[i]recommend this game for those people who likes multiplayer first person shooter[/i]
[spoiler]To be honest this game play's like crossfire but updated graphics![/spoiler]
[h1]Maybe thats all for today[/h1]"
19963,"This game seems to be cool but since its no controller support and the devs said they will not make it controller compatiable i guess ill unistall, im not a big fan of key board and mouse for FPS."
19964,"black squad

>no black people in the squad"
19965,OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
19966,This game is really fun! Reminds me a lot of Combat Arms back in the day. I'd reccomend this game to anyone who is looking for a new game to goof around on with friends or get competitive with.
19967,"- Very good Gunfights
- No pay 2 win

I love simple shooters like this, and i think il stick to this one. Much love!
Lets see what updates will come to the game

10/10 would get again.!"
19968,"Not sure how this FTP got so many good reviews, there have been so many more better featuresd FTPFPS games that have vanished from existence and not sure how this one got through. Game is boring and repeitive and the mechanics of the shooting in the game are mediocre. The game with the best gun phsyics/ mechanics was operation 7. That game used to have thousands of players but recently died because steam refused to put the game on it."
19969,"First of all let me say ""Absolutely no pay to win"" is perhaps the greatest joke of our generation.  If you want the big strong guns you're paying around $50/ea for them.  You can earn one of there many types of currency by playing games but there is a handful of gun choices for that currency.  What you buy is much more abundant and will cost anywhere from 2k-20k tokens costing you .99/8, you can do the math there.

Spawns also need a great deal of work on this.  I was in one game where for about 50 of there kills they sat in a room just above our spawn and killed us as we came up.  You and your group have a single spawn location you all ways spwan at.  It's box spawn not position spawn.  So you have one box location for each team and thats where your team spawns.

The gun movement feels fluid, movement itself feels cheap. Hit register isn't bad but not great.  You can dance in this game which means you have to get lucky or reallly do a good job predicting their dance movements.  Hit markers arn't bad but medium to close range when you're both dancing is frustrating at best.

Thats about all i had time to really get a feel for.  After a few matches og getting spawn camped with more powerful guns that I was willing to spend the money on i said enough.  
If the cheap mechanics and spawns fixed, make movement more realistic it would be a decent game.  Might even be willing to drop a little on buying weapons if they lower the price a little.  But for now i don't see why it's been reviewed so highly.  Pass."
19970,reminds me of CSgo not bad!
19971,most of the time you wont be with players that are your own skill level so u will either get rekt by gods at that game or steam roll some noobs its pointless
19972,"PIECE OF SHIT game, cheaters online, Graphics are shit and there is NO REPORT button???!
The way it was made to earn money/Xp also is crap.. idk what they were thinking at the time, maybe on drugs?"
19973,"I've been playing this game since 2016 when it's not on steam, there are lot of cheaters after couple months. Thank God they moved to steam!"
19974,"Positives: game plays very smoothly and looks great

Negatives: TDM spawns do not move, which gives very little reason to push into the enemy team when combined with health that doesn't regenerate and no health packs. No rewards for doing well with a 2/3/4/5 kdr either."
19975,Its sucks its just COD AND CSGO MIXED BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
19976,"Cant launch it 



Luckily I can delete it"
19977,"What an absolutely awful game. This is worse than COD for spawn camping, so doesn't give new players a chance, despite this I still managed to get a positive KDR, but if I wanted a game exactly like CS:GO, I'd go play CS:GO.

Uninstalled after less than an hour, would not recommend this game even to people I dislike, no one deserves this sort of punishment."
19978,I love it Its a very fun game and It has alot of maps one of my problems with it is that the BS are way too hard to obtain (I still havent gotten a single one)
19979,"Hi, im great fan of Black Squad, I play many hours, but I think Black Squad someday turns from Free to play to Paid Game, because since the game was released, the updates are all with many new features and in relation to the new characters, new weapons, customizations, among others, comes practically almost everything with the price in BS coins and Gold, an exaggeration altogether.
I would like Black Squad improved this, because if nothing is done, where is the reason to win the game's coins, and then I can not use them any more in more opens, i don't bother if others things cost more, but at least we have the objective to achieve that amount of game coins playing."
19980,it feels very unnatural and i didnt like the gameplay
19981,Very enjoyable all round game
19982,the grapichs are ofcourse not as good as in the trailer but its a fairly fun game to play
19983,Probably the most well behaved FPS community
19984,"This is a poor game. Maps are the smallest I have ever played on.
The demolition modes are ok, think CS or S&D on CoD. But even still, just a bad game even for free to be honest."
19985,bad game
19986,ONE THING! THIS GAME IS TOO GOOD TO BE FREE!
19987,"it would have been great if you included the two countries as a card item, the ones that i've mentioned numerous times on your FAQ and everywhere else that i could. talking about Albania and Kosovo, we got quite a few players that are waiting on them. im posting it here cause the only way you will ever notice is if its affecting your ratings."

19999,honestly i played this a few times back in like 2017 or something but it was pretty cool i guess
20000,"TAC RELOAD!
TAC RELOAD!
TAC RELOAD!
TAC RELOAD!"
20001,"I will give a balanced review.

This game has more older school gameplay.
Dont expect brand new stuff.
Even older computers can run it easily.

Game play is okay.
Guns and hitboxes seem okay.
Graphics are a bit old, but its clear and visible.

Comparison to some older free games:

Wolf:ET
Warrock
Blacklight Retribution

These above games, were better polished and imo the best free fps.
So if Black Squad moves in those direction that would be better.

I think Black Squad has potential.
Add more maps.
Improve the speed, running.
Improve graphics.

Otherwise, I recommend trying it if you are tired of mainstream games,
if you like older style games and so on.





"
20002,"Black Squad is an AWESOME free-to-play Miltary FPS. To be honest, im not the kind of guy that does reviews. But this game is so good, i just had to let people know. The game not only has a VAST variety of settings, it is not pay to win. There are a variety of different fun gamemodes that will keep you on your toes! The combat is very fluid, fun, and engaging. I highly reccomend this to anyone who is looking to install.
"
20003,"Its like CSGO, but free and unbalanced"
20004,super fun free to play fps .
20005,"Great game, well balanced, llightweight and very smooth! suitable for players of all skill levels! looking forward to updates! 

Would definitely reccommend. check the link for a full review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4DReDUol9Q"

20008,"zzz
"
20009,"I enjoyed this game better when it was downloading ,becouse i have good internet but i had like 300 ping all the time idk why."
20010,nice game ^^
20011,Great realistic shooting game. Just as infuriating in gun play as all the shooting game genre. Please add more characters into the game to add charater diversity. As far as gun diversity it is good but I would like to have gun customization options like putting a grenade launcher on my favorite gun and so forth.
20012,"its free so i automatically reccomend this game.

however this game could be soo much better if the developers had some common sense, i mean the controls are very odd. using the mouse wheel to run and change to weapons and grenades is a bad idea and the character pulls out a knife while running. Furthermore it will make you bad at other FPS games. 
there are not more attatchments other than laser and supressor. there are many hackers, and the physics are just bad.

HOWEVER! its a free game so its very good for the price lol. it does not require high specs, i mean i dont have a gfx card and i can play on high setting. its quite enjoyable too. 
so overall a nice game."
20013,The map is inbalance and please nerf the nades this game is shit when your team just keep on camping
20014,Good growth potential
20015,"Would love to even play the game but the damn thing won't even launch, i've tried numerous times, my PC isn't the issue cause it's pretty powerful, however i open up the little menu that says play, i wait for the game to launch but it doesn't"
20016,"Game plays good, wish there was sprinting though. The game plays very familiar to a different game I used to play called Alliance of Valiant Arms. There are classes for certain modes. My only dislikes is that there aren't customizable weapons with mod-able parts. Also I am getting around 140-350 ping on NA servers, which is the region I am in."
20017,"Meh, if you dont have Overwatch, play Paladins. If you dont have Call of Duty, play Black Squad"
20018,its gat
20019,the graphics made me threw up
20020,"Nice looking game, ok to play but just too much crap, trying to copy all the bullcrap in all the AAA games is a bad way to start in my opinion, but still the game is decent and has some merit.  I will follow it and see the updates etc."
20021,"For a game out for so long the number of guns available is horrendously low( which is my main issue with this game)
Few maps
Weird head shot system(tested with a friend had to hit him 3 times with the HNK to kill him while standing still at point blank)
Very few game modes, nothing besides the generic stuff

20022,"very noice

20026,mabe you have to put a kick button to the game or report button?
20027,"Decent game - the graphics don't feel very high-end to my tastes, but it makes me feel nostalgic at some points. I love being able to add a suppressor on the fly in-game. I find that the gameplay is easy to get into and to be good at for someone who has played shooters a fair amount, but you can die as easily as you can kill even with possibly the least accurate weapons as long as you're not trying to kill someone from sniper range with anything but a sniper rifle. Granted, I don't get why the LMGs have such poor accuracy - surely a more realistic and maybe fairer penalty to these guns should be for movement? This would mean that snipers, shotguns and high-caliber handguns won't the only exclusively powerful firearms out there. I'm also a bit annoyed by how the bipods of the LMGs are unusable even though the Pecheneg has them down.

The game feels like CS:GO, except with more customisation, a F2P model and none of the BS about having to play like a professional, which I welcome.

I love how there is no BS about having to repair your weapons, and I love how you're given a generous amount of gold from playing the game the first time that could go to a weapon that is always permanent, at least in my experience. 

The class system gives you a bit more freedom as well with what firearm you want to equip alongside tactical or support equipment, which I think is quite convenient compared to other shooters where you're stuck with highly specialised firearms for your class.

Just one bug I wish they would fix - OBS doesn't do a very good job of being able to detect this game in Game Capture. I can use Window Capture instead for the time being. Also, I keep experiencing the Under Maintenance notification whenever I launch the game."
20028,"Played this game on release, the hype was deffinately bigger.
However there is still a solid playerbase,

I would recommend this game to anyone sceptical of trying it. The worst thing is that you dont enjoy the game, but many do becuase it is well made.
I read another comment that mentioned quick matches being a stomp or get stomped fealing, which was true for the most part. This is a rather easy fix if they implement an elo system or mmr.

I will deffinetely be revisiting this game often for it has alot of potention even in the competetive market of FPS and making its way to ESL and events as such.

- 11/26 -
Game still feals great, still free 2 play, and I still recommend this to my friends."
20029,"NO pay to win, BETTER and Decent graphics than CS:GO, menu need some upgrades rest is quite good for early access game"
20030,"better than cs:go
"
20031,This probably the most pay to win game ive ever played in my life.
20032,"""It is CrossFire, CS:GO and COD together. It's NOT rip-off, it has a lot potential. The hitbox is very good. As Early Access it have some bugs at general. Also it is active. ""
Posted: 3 Oct, 2017

I review again now after 2 years. The game is well-organized, devs seems to made awesome job. Game running much smoother now, even at my low end PC. You don't need to pay for good guns, cause with the reward system you can buy them in less them easily. If you know what to buy and what no, you can enjoy it like all others. It's my opinion after all. I think this is the best multiplayer FPS game ever for PC, in it's kind, and i have played many all these years."
20033,Not bad.
20034,"kicked bc off high ping lol
10/10"
20035,"TL;DR: The core of this is an okay shooter, but it has these glaring flaws that are apparent from the first match you play. Ignore the positive reviews with half an hour of game time, it seems despite ""enjoying"" the game they couldn't be bothered to ever play the game for even an hour, which is telling.

Black squad is a game i recently read someone mention was a good f2p fps. I installed it, i tried it. The production values are kinda low, especially in voice acting, and the tutorial was more annoying than anything else (not rebinding wasd to azerty keyboard properly, the tutorial actually locked you out of changing any of your options, including keybinds). The menu's and general language isn't great, but serviceable. It's kind of obvious the developers are porting this game, with their primary language not being english.

So far, nothing terribly great, nothing really bad. But then you get to the gameplay, and... well, it's not terrible either, but it's definitely leaning towards the ""bad"" side on the scale, to the point where you should really not expect to play this g ame for a few hours at most, if you can stomach the issues. It's got all the basics of an fps, but the mechanics leave much to be desired. You have 100 health, but in reality you might as well be running on 2 health, with guns either doing one or two damage; the time to kill is just ridicilously short. And with no way to regain health, getting hit even once typically means any next engagement is suicide, with no way to actually regain health. Sure, in a single game mode there's a single class that can give health packs, but they only give 50 health (so, one bullet worth from an assault rifle) and cost a resource that's better spent on things that can't evaporate instantly. The spawns in the maps are 100% static, and many maps are an exact mirror from one side to the other; this doesn't really aid replayability, and spawncamping can be an issue... mostly in the big gamemode with classes, where an airstrike can be placed right at spawn, so anyone not in the 3 second invulnerability dies right after spawning with no possible countr.

The gun variety is good on first glance, but i've found a lot of the guns to... largely feel pretty much the same. I'm sure there's a few guns that stand out in terms of stats, but in general, they're all the typical modern guns you'd expect, and they all feel largely the same despite being different guns. This probably has a lot to do with the time to kill: when you can die or kill in half a second or less, any gun can probably do the job so long as it actually shoots bullets. At least the guns feeling so similar has one nice benefit; you can just stick to the standard assault rifle and not miss out on much. And if you do want to get one of the other guns, the ""gold"" you start out with is enough to buy one or two weapons. Grenades are a daily rental which is odd, but they don't cost much and you also get a reward for every day you log in, so that sort of pays for itself. Trying out all the weapons would get extremely grindy and involve paying actual money instead, but it's far from being pay to win, which is good. There's also (currently) free ""dlc"" packs that give you 15 day rentals of most weapons for free, so you can try them out.

One big glaring issue in the game overall is the snipers... they're expensive, the starting one sucks, and maps are designed to be advantageous to snipers, while they have no scope sway or really any downside. The result is that half the time you go across a corner and immediately get one shot. Not even a headshot is required for the good ones, just in the torso is enough. The majority of your gameplay in this game will be spawning, running across any window or past any corner and instantly dying. While the extremely negative play experience hints at hackers/aimbots abusing the sniper mechanics, it's difficult to tell if that's actually what's going on, due to my next issue....

The netcode. The steam page touts ""amazing netcode"", but over half the time it works plainly terrible. People will hit you through solid cover constantly, and i don't mean ""i just dove into cover"", it's not uncommon to go behind cover and then get hit over half a second or even a second later, because someone decided they could still shoot you and the server simply okays that action. Because of this, getting one shot from full health is common  even for assault rifles and SMG's, and combined with the terrible time to kill, if anyone shoots you and you didn't see them first, a lot of the time  you're already dead. Not in the ""you're going to die"" sense, you're literally already dead on their end, and the server has already decided you're dead, but your game (despite running at 50 ping to the server) hasn't caught up yet somehow. This is a constant damper on any and all gameplay, making people randomly phase through bullets and able to shoot your past self.

As a final note, this game is in ""early access"" but from what i can tell, it is a port of a game that's already been released years ago in korea. As such, i don't think you can expect it to improve much in the core issues like netcode, since they've had years to do it before in their other version and this port makes it clear they didn't. That's not to say it CAN'T change, but it's very unlikely. Launching in ""early access"" when your game is already in a fully released state is kind of a poor way to try and raise more forgiving opinions of the game."
20036,"From the perspective of someone who plays NA server and mainly TDM and Battle game modes.

Pros:
+All guns when obtained are permanent (aside from the DLC on the Steam page).
+You can try out several weapons temporarily for free from the Steam page (15 days when activated) 
+The game is simple. Not much needed to understand, many maps are very identical in layout for either side.
+There is a custom game channel where you can go join whatever room you want and has a little variety of stuff not in the quick game channel.
+There's a solo practice mode you can enter to explore maps of all the gamemodes and lets you set up target dummies and try out nade spots.
+Ingame currency for regular shop is easy to obtain from matches, daily login, and playing for certain amounts of time a week.

Cons:
-The game has mediocre English typos throughout the place. 
-As with all FPS titles, fair amount of toxic players who chat more than they shoot once things don't go their way. 
-It seems whenever Black Squad receives a significant update it resets your settings (or at least it happened to me recently). Potentially have to redo your sound settings, reticle settings, and sensitivity.
-Wouldn't say it's dead but the servers are barely active when it's a bit into the night (10/11pm PDT). 
-Lately they've been releasing most new weapons to the medal shop as opposed to adding anything else to the regular shop. 
-Grenades are temporary purchases.
-Practice mode is limited in what you can test (no moving targets, class system for battle mode, objectives for battle mode).


If you're only interested in killing stuff in TDM/Battle mode during the evening, sure go ahead and try the game. Don't expect too much out of the game though, It's a ""meh okay"" overall."
20037,Very nice. i'm random box i got karabit
20038,great except for high amounts of spwan camping in TDM and a lack of original game modes except for assasionation which i have never see in a game before (but.thats probly cause i dont play to many fps) otherwise considering its still in EA its pretty decent as it has no pay to win and give you 3 free weapon dlc packs that grant you free weapons for 15 days to activate at your own liesiure and a you earn money pretty quick and all purchases are for cosmetic and in no way give you an advantage overall it earn an 8/10 in my opinion
20039,for free (y)
20040,"Someone explained the game to me and I was ok with it.  How the game work and how to buy the weapons and other stuff without real money and with what to buy it with a few tip also.  The game is very addictive, want more and more.  I still play the game and will keep playing it.  

Not to hard to play as a game.  Very simple actualy when knowing how.

The weapons are cool and fun.  Just enough weapon for now, cause more with OP weapon will destroy the game.  Imagine any OP weapon with a one bullet kill !!  

Its october 9th 2017 and since yesterday there is at least 10% of the players that are cheating.  This is only since yeterday that I found that there's more... so sad.

I hope they will not let the cheaters overwhelm the entire game.
The cheaters or the hackers are what makes good games go sour.  So don't let them.

I still find the game very good but I hope they will do something about it or the game will be dead in no time.
I don't know how they manage to cheat but they do.

I hope it will not be an other game that I will have to scrap because of that."
20041,I found this game extremely fun as my laptop cant run the best stuff. This games runs fantasticly on my laptop and its not even graphicly bad. i found the gameplay very intense and fun. and players should play before judging. 9/10. only 9 cos i suck at the game :). good game
20042,takes awhile to get used to shoot and aim but its a nice game very nice very nice but only play 10 games a day just so you dont rage.
20043,"Very fun, jus lil slow pased"
20044,It's an alright game but it's not my favorite game
20045,niceee gamee :)
20046,It's not worth downloading it plays like an mobile game trash graphics and gameplay warface is alot better
20047,"#1 every game since getting SIZMPX

"
20048,"It's free so I do recommend that you try it out.

I deinstalled it after a few hours. I don't feel it's worth my time.

Main reason is that it still is a very basic grenade spam, sniper camping FPS.
Also when one side is slightly winning after some point they will in most cases steamroll the other side. That's due to the reward system (killstreaks). I really disliked that.

I found the netcode to be mediocre, it seems to favor the player with higher ping.Too often I've been shot before I could see the player coming toward me."
20049,"Objectively this game really is not bad by any means, of course there is room for improvement. 
- Shitty UI
- Poor map design
- Some imperfect aspects to the gunplay, but it isnt bad at all. 
I am recommending this becuase these are issues that can be fixed easily. 
For a F2P game, it really is not bad at ll."
20050,"i was hoping there would be a store for in game items
"
20051,"I played it for about half an hour, and I am not going to spend half an hour writing a review, that said: 
It looks good, but that's the end of all the positive things I could say about this game. The few maps I played were terrible, and all of the rounds ended up with one team spawncamping the other. And if they weren't spawncamping, they were camping elsewhere. A bit of camping would not be a huge deal if it had not been for the fact that there's no sprint options, just imagine playing Battlefield without being able to sprint, and you understand how bad that fact is. 

The gunplay was shit, and all the guns were basically laserbeams. Shooting from the hips did not have any drawbacks either so I just used that when aiming down the sights were too bothersome. 

I'd pay for this game just so I could ask for a refund."
20052,"nice game

Not so great menu, but fun as hell...

I recommend this game, but it definetly needs work!"
20058,"I've barely even played this piece of shit and i already love it!
The mechanics are more COD but then the gameplay feels abit more csgo sided if you get me.
CSGO is dying and until valve fixes it i think most players will move to this sort of game!
Love it lots of fun lol idek wat else to say i have 4 hours on this game ;)"
20059,its a good game well polished for a early access game i would like there to be a little bit better sniping but then again thats just me good game would recommend getting

20062,"Finally!  An FPS that you don't have to play non-stop to get good equipment.  An FPS that old guys who played Halo, unreal tourney and the like can be competive in without having to spend time we don't have grinding for gear whilst getting smoked by some 12 year old.  Good ""old"" fashioned team death match were skill makes a bigger difference than equipment.  The best part is its free but I will make the $30 purchase to support the developers."
20063,"Its free to play,,,,its a fps game and its cool...especially camos/skins"
20064,"Great game!
"
20065,"Tired of CSGO? Has Call of Duty lost your attention?  
Why not play both?

Black Squad is what would happen if CSGO and COD made sweet sweet love while listening to community concerns in each game.


COD like features:
Huge variety of guns that can all be purchased with the free in-game currency. 
Hitmarkers like COD
No economy, choose your weapons at the start of each round.
Very balanced grenade launchers on roughly 25% of guns.

CSGO like features:
small maps for Demolition ( de_ )
Recoil control incredibly important, no holding M1
5v5 bomb plant mode ""demolition"" plays exactly like CSGO besides a 6 second plant / defuse timer.
Movement

Blacksquad is one of those rare free to play games that are actually.... free to play. Everything besides skins are earned with ingame currency that you gain by playing and logging in. 2-3 days of play per weapon has been my average. You can speed this process up with boosts but not needed whatsoever.

Blacksquad also has a major advantage that other F2P FPS don't have. It has a Thriving competitive edition in South Korea. This game is a port from that game with a few western twists and it is obvious that the devs are experienced with how smooth their weekly balance and skin updates are. Battleeye anti-cheat is amazing and in 80 hours I have experienced 2 cheaters. 

Overall if you want to get in on the ground floor of the next thriving competitive F2P games start practicing now. 7k avg players will skyrocket once more people try it out."
20066,"game is good
"
20067,"good game. but give a better chance to get skins. thats gonna best.
 
9/10 for this game"

20071,"very good game, I enjoy playing death match mode"
20072,"Good feeling FPS, would play again if it had better optimisation."
20073,awesome
20074,recomend it for a free cs go alternative & call of duty alternative i recomend it only grip is ping is horendious for new zealand but its part in parcel with a free game. Taken to it like duck to water apart from the lagg fun part is getting a satisfying headshot kill on a camping sniper thats nailed my team with lagg. The only game i have played where players with a ping advantage still can have a run for there $ against players with a nasty ping & be competative. I use to be a big half life counter strike player in the day so for a free game been a good progression. Interface is a little out of wach but its part being a free game tho for what it is great game to play for free. Highly recomended even the hackers & cheaters have a hard time cheating if you know how to counter them. Great game for newbies if they want some nice high ranking scalps to notch to your service records.
20075,nice game
20076,"For a free game, it's really a great game, I'm sure I'd recommend trying it, you will not regret it.

Thank you from the creators of this game"
20077,"this game is defintly, an awesome game. they have tons of updates, and a good amount of guns, i do recommend this game"
20078,"I really enjoy black squad. The maps are a bit small for my liking, but for a free fps and as much effort as the dev team has put into this, I absolutely love it. They are constantly putting out content and fixing their bugs shortly after they discover them. I see this game off to a great path of competitveness and feel it's gonna be a great full release when the time comes. I recommend this to FPS enthusiast."
20079,"The gameplay is boring overall, the sensiitivity is super slow by default (adjusting it is difficult), guns don't feel alive they just feel like im clicking and something is happening on the screen, and enemies die in 1 second and you die in 1 second. Maps are so small that you can go to the enemy spawn in 5 seconds of walking.

The tutorial didn't fit the game either, it felt like that of an fps story-based game. It kept locking your controls whenever a hint popped up, gave unclear instructions and ended with an unnecessary cinematic.

The controls to the game are also a bit funky as middle mouse button is sprint for some reason.

Overall, I went in wanting to like the game and it couldn't even keep me hanging on for more than 30 minutes."

20112,"I wouldn't of downvoted if it weren't for the misleading, over-confident description.

""Battleye support, dedicated servers, great shooting mechanics and amazing netcode. Black Squad is a military first-person-shooter game using the Unreal Engine 3 to show realistic graphics and dynamic visuals. Absolutely no Pay-to-Win. Welcome to the best F2P shooter on the market.""

-Battleye clearly isn't going well when the other players are complaining about cheaters in the reviews.
-Dedicated servers? Check. 30 tick? Check.
-Shooting mechanics are medicore at best. Shots didn't register with snipers whatsoever during my gameplay. 
-No pay-to-win? Why do you have to buy guns then?
-ALL animations, voice acting, 'dynamic visuals' like blood, all just feel awkward.
-Takes mechanics from CS:GO such as game-made map callouts, no sprinting, shift walk, move drastically different speeds depending which weapon is out, left & right click knife, lots of knife skins, fast zoom ins etc. (just what I noticed after an hour of playtime without even trying to look for CS:GO resemblances). Thinking about it, it just feels like a cheap CS:GO knockoff... without voice chat, yep.. no voice chat.

The only thing going for this game is that it uses Unreal Engine 3. 

Welcome to the most mediocore F2P shooter on the market (if even)."
20113,"Amazing, I would easy pay $20-50 doller for this game. The graphics are outstanding and the gamemodes are like COD and CSGO mixed together. I reccomended this game to all of my friends because it is outstanding."
20114,cool
20115,"This is a good free fps game with good gameplay, acceptable graphics, and a decent community. Only problem is the spawn killers due to the small maps and the hackers. 
"
20116,"The game is not really p2w, but it is very heavily ""get outgunned often till you have grinded a weapon that functions"".

This mostly ties to the purchased guns with varied stats from the ingame shop using various currencies. 
But lets focus on the currencies for f2p customers of gold and medals. 
Which highlight the ""pay2winnish"" aspect of the game best.

Gold is received from matches, daily logins and quests. 
At a rate which could easily allow a player to gain 2 new ""gold currency"" guns per week.
  
Medals are earned from every 7th day login (500 medals) and from daily quests (max 100 medals). 
Medal currency pistols cost 1500 while rifles start from 2500. For a player to gain medals for the rifles they would have to play a minimum of 15 days, fully completing the multipart daily mission each day. 

So why are these 2500 medal rifles so important? Well...
All assault rifles capable of 1 shot HS kills (SR-47, AK-12, AK-47 + DMR MK14 MOD1) are all behind medal currency.
And lets be honest here, aside from sniper rifles in godly hands, the smgs, shotguns and MGs can run into very bad engagement ranges.

Thus the ""king of the field"" weapon category AR and especially its best performing models are what this game centers around. So for those aforementioned 15 days, players are somewhat gimped depending on their preferred initial weapon choice and maps(specifically types of engagement areas) they happen to play in.

Also due to the damage multipliers and shots to kill damage numbers certain weapons are just way better than others.
IE. G36 GL which is the best (HNK417 GL has vastly worse stats and cannot even 1 shot HS) grenade launcher modded AR capable of 3 bodyshot kills from the gold currency store. 
Its counterpart MDR GL on the medal currency store has 1 less dmg 34 instead of G36's 35, 
but this difference does not matter since its still 3 bodyshots to kill and with other MDR GL's stats being vastly superior.

The game has no hit tagging, so guns with lower damage and higher rate of fire fall further behind high damage guns. Aside from sticking to very close range engagement areas of the maps with smgs/shotguns/high RoF AR's or using a sniper rifle. There isn't much else to do than accept the fact that you are literally getting outgunned for a minimum of 2 weeks (or you just log in and out of the game for the next 4 weeks).

The medal currency store also includes such items as the Desert Eagle which is the only pistol capable of 1 shot HS and 2 bodyshot kills. Or the ""high skill ceiling"" sniper rifle M107A1 which can 1 shot kill even from a toe or finger nail hit.

Game itself is a good mid ground of CS:GO and CoD, but only when player gear start to be on a level playfield. But be vary of the initial wall you will have to climb over if you dont put money in."
20117,"I know no one gives a sh1t, so let's just skip the part where this game is meant for rejected asians that suck at CSGO and it's literally spray & pray.

No matter where you aim, most of the time u just gotta click a couple of times near the chest and somehow you get a headshot, even at point blank and NO, it's not the recoil/physics bullsh1t, it's a mindblowing embarassment.

Won't bore anyone with the details.

PROS: 

- Easy af, and I mean it.
- As september 28, 2017, still isn't a p2w, but it's slowly heading there (skin's hitbox are off, SOMEHOW, noticeable on the guy with the tanktop).
- Engrish is rampant and hilarious, expect buyed, bobs and vegenas.

CONS:

- Battleye, the amount of hackers is quite a sight, most popular hacks seems to be no recoil and autoaim
- Devs don't give a flying sh1t about players feedback.
- Unbalanced weapons.
- Outdated version of the game.
- UI is literally a mobile clusterfck, if you wanna learn how not to design a UI look no further.
- Alt + Tab during a match cause my computer to unlock god mode by skyrocketing ping, enemy team rages, I moan.

Wanna keep this short, doesn't even worth the time, but did I mention devs don't take feedback into account? well they don't, I grew spiderwebs waiting for a fucking colorblind mode since beta."
20118,crap
20119,"Quite a good game, I like the mix between other great games like COD and CSGO! 

If your looking for a free to play shooter, then this is the best one in my eyes"
20120,It is a lot of fun the games are always different and playstylew is awsome. very quick games
20121,8/8 IGN WOULD PLAY AGAIN
20122,"Great solid game for an early access that is free to play.

I think I enjoyed playing this more than CS GO.

Everyone should at least try this game, gameplay is smooth and exciting.

So far, I haven't seen any enemy lag moving which makes this game awesome. 

I can already see myself spending a lot of time playing this cool game.

20123,"way to many cheatrs

20124,"Graphic are not so good

If u like Call of duty with all the air stike u gona love this game.. Air stike ,missile and all stupid stuff

20126,You are calling thi SH!T a game????
20127,"Eh...
"
20128,"I so badly want to recommend this game but I just can't. It's mechanics are really good for a true f2p except the fact that if you move while shooting your sniper, it goes everywhere else besides where your ""crosshairs"" would be. But there's one thing that makes it more annoying than anything. It's the connection. In the short time I've played it I can't tell you how many times I would shoot someone on my screen and instantly get killed by that person without them taking any damage. You could snipe someone dead center in the chest and it registered as you shot a blank. At least in games like battlefield your bullets would still register and hit even if you die. If they fix the connection I think it would be one of the best f2p games on steam."
20129,"Shit game, eat dix."
20130,please play this game for the love of god you will love it
20131,"GOOD GAME BUT FULL OF AIM BOTS MANY HACK THIS GAME MAKE IT A SHITTY EXPIRIENCE ! 
dont download it beleive me"
20132,FPS for free? Play this!
20133,"It's an excellent game and easy to pick up, however I feel like the game needs a VAC system or Anti-Hack program to prevent hacking. There is already a website out making hacks for this game and a lot of users are using walling programs and aimbot. Other than that it's a great game."

20137,If you play csgo and are good this one lets you dumpster on plebians. Honestly th game feels well optimised for a higher end pc as you can get constant 144 hz with it being smooth and looking nice. Overall fun for free
20138,"Riddled with cheaters and trolls.They need to remove the radio feature as it is used not to help functionality of coordination in the game but rather as a troll to annoy the team with annoying and loud in-game vocals, that you cannot mute. =/"

update: i am the best at this game"
20143,"I will still give this game more time to improve therefore, I will update this ""review"" in the future. For now, I will give it a tentative thumbs up as an indicator that the game is already good in its current state and this is one of those high potential titles for me. Also, this one isn't a pay-to-win title despite it being a free multiplayer shooter so this fact already gives it a +1 in my book."

20146,"before this game came out i was really excited about it 
few weeks later after i saw the trailer to this game i found out yay i can get a key to a kinda closed beta.
(it wasnt a closed beta cos u could join the discort server and ask a bot for a key an even send a text message to the headleader of the game) .After few hours of testing i was really disapointed . [Disapointment] = [I went to youtube and watched some tutorials. How to kill my self there i found a viedo where a guy did a tutorial about a forbidden knot it helped me alot  . before i finally considered to kill my self i stil was in the black squad discort server
where i tried to contact the head leader and saying that this game is really trash .......]
okok guys now ill say why this game is really trashy
pros
_____
There are non cos it is really just like the others free to play shooters with trashy hit reg and where u have no difference in the accuracy of the weapon when u shoot with aim and without aim (with rightclick ur bullets are like 5 % more accurate than
without right click ) i mean this game have  the trashyest granade ,smoke, and flashbang physics i hav ever seen in my entire fuking life . i was even watching their stream where they said in korea its will be like an ESL or something but i dont think that
 will happening . guys if u say yes but this game is stil in early access (i dont care cos its even too bad for a early access
 [shame on the developers])after closed beta this game finally came out as an early access where u hav to play the tutorial
 again with some new features like centry and a airstrike after the tutoriel i have never seen it again and still shitty hit reg and
 still like 5 % more accuracy while aiming

pls guys do not play this game
there how many times i reapeat it to not play this at home

20147,"At the start of every Korean Free2Play FPS I am kind of sceptical. Generally the gameplay is good to great, however it is all up to the publisher to make the game stand out and make it survive. We have all seen great games like this go downunder, because of Pay2Win elements destroying the ecosystem. Luckily so far, Black Squad isn't one of them. 

Guns are easily purchasable trough playing. Armor or repairing isn't a thing and the only way this game allows you to spend money is trough cosmetics and boosts for xp/money, which doesn't effect gameplay by one bit. Speaking of gameplay, the game is fairly decent. No extremely overpowered guns and with NEOWIZ bringing out updates regularly the balance is decent. 

All in all I would currently rate this game 8/10 if you compare it to other Free2Play shooters. The game has potential, but we have to see what happens to it over the next 12 months to really find out if this one to stay for the long run."
20148,good!
20149,"So, I've nearly put/over 100 hours into this game now and i must say it is very fun and addictive. If you are looking for a fun free FPS game this is the one for you.
A few problems with the game though: Hackers, There are a few hackers in Black Squad i have run into that weren't going obvious but you can tell the Anti-Cheat for Black Squad needs to be improved.
Another thing, Campers. I know the Devs can't do anything about how people play the game but there are alot of campers in Black Squad that get very annoying at times.
Something that is very annoying in Black Squad is the Matchmaking (MM). I think there needs to be a better MM system in Black Squad because in-game i am lvl 2LT which is ok but i am getting matched with very low levels or very high levels and full squads beyond my skill group.


That wraps up this review of the game and if you are new to the game and want a strong AR with a lot of recoil i recommend the AK-47 or if u want accuracy i recommend the S15

Thank you for your time"
20150,"A good game for early access.

Play once you will play again 

One hard pet is that it takes a long one to get new weapons.
So things in this game should be easier to get."
20151,ghdfghgh
20152,You know the game has a problem when most players have an average of 300 ping.
20153,I like this game because it can run on my potato pc

20159,"Great game to play, will and have recommended to many friends."
20160,Game is free. I want my money back.
20161,"It's more like white team.

DreamTeam4life"
20162,"Fun game to play every now and then. However, I just wish there were a more variety of shotguns, pistols, LMGs, and pistols because there are too many assault rifles in the game. I also don't understand the buy system: why use buy systems that only last from one day up to a week or so when you can just buy the weapon you want and keep it forever? I also wish there were more gamemodes, like I don't know; hostage rescue, search and destroy, capture the flag, something like that.

In short, this game has potential, but it needs more weapons, a better buy system, and more gamemodes in order to make this as playable as other games such as CS:GO or Sven Co-op."
20163,so i spent 9.99 on 1200 bullets....i went to go buy some random cases ( which are 80 bullets ) and when i got it....i was only able to get one case.....plz tell me i made a mistake or something...btw please line up the iron sights on the deagle
20164,This game has amazing graphics no lag and fair play i would recommmend this game to everyone love this FPS game keep up the good work!
20165,"I've never wanted to uninstall a game so fast.

The hitreg is a nightmare, everything is clunky and stilted, you run around like you've crapped your pants, the netcode is sh!t, the weapons have no impact and feel exactly the same, they say there is no pay to win but there are items of greater stats behind money-bought currency than what you can get for free, hackers ruining everything by sniping you through 4 to 5 solid walls.

The entire thing is a pile of hot liquid-garbage. Don't pollute your system with this cancer of a game.

--UPDATE--
I tried playing the game again recently. The only difference between how it was in the past and how it is now, is that now movement is completely floaty as all hell and there isn't much in terms of hacking. That being said, the game's netcode is still completely fuckked and overall after an entire year, not much has been added to it content-wise or mechanics-wise.  Not to mention the fact that I believe the game still thinks it's the christmas season because it was giving out holiday boxes upon login that mentioned ""happy holidays""  Chances are it is due to the lack of updates regarding the game."
20166,It's basically free CoD.
20167,"be good if there was an esea like thing for this game 

"
20168,"This game was quite fun when I started playing it but not anymore because of all the hackers that are playing in this game and there is no point to play because you cannot even report people.

Please help.

It is a really cool game except for the people that are hacking."
20169,"This game honestly just feels like trading kills 
its pretty boring"
20170,"Big streamer for Black Squad. If you play CSGO, Combat Arms, AVA, Point Blank, Project blackout, Soldier Front and pretty much any F2P Shooter game, this game is worth the try!! Best F2P shooter game by far!

There is a small base competitive scene for NA and EU. Hoping ESL Gaming will pick this game up after TwitchCon. The Developers are doing a great job listening to the community and they also do Weekly Streams on Wednesday. 

This game is strictly F2P! The only thing you pay in this game is only SKINS! And the skins in this game are way better than CSGO skins.

This game is worth a try! You won't be disappointed. If you would like to know more about the tournaments in this game. Hit me up on twitch!! Very big Black Squad Streamer! pretty well known around the community :)"
20171,I don't recommend this game.
20172,"I simply got bored. There are better games like Blacklight Retribution that are much more fun to play. Agreed on 2 things -
Doesn't take long to connect to the servers.
And second - The players who play it are not toxic.

I've barely played this game to even have an opinion, but this is my personal opinion - I am more of a CS:GO player so it is kind of difficult to get used to other games like these.

I love how everything in the game can be earned, all games should do that haha."
20173,"Probably the most average game (not just shooter) I've played this year. Aside from competent hit detection and decent sound design, I found it to be an awfully generic by the numbers F2P asian millitary shooter with no redeeming or standout feature. It has the most basic movement system and the most basic gunplay you can think of for an FPS title, and the 5 or 6 maps I had ""pleasure"" to play through belong to wtf-tier of ""How To Make Shooter For Dummies"" map making tutorial, and the general gunplay plays like your standard low budget F2P millitary shooter. I can see why this game has an audience especially since it's free, I personally just found the game to be shockingly generic with no identity at all."
20174,"why there is no more weapons
"
20175,"Good FPS even though its P2W u can pwn ppl with any guns ,Hackerz included (bad anti-cheat... i think)"
20176,"+ Nice graphics
- Bad controls
- Not much to do
"
20177,"Hybrid of CS and COD.
Not bad sound effect, and need more fine tune.

Of course more dedicated server are must, like China, Japan, Hongkong, Singapore and ETC in ASIA one, now Asia server has high ping & delay. I'm Asia player anyway :)"
20178,"Good game Still in early Acess Still waiting for the final
EDIT: still the best game"
20179,Best Game Than Blackshot
20180,"To me it seems like a modernized clone of WarRock (if any of you know what that game is)...

I liked WarRock...

I like Black Squad..."
20181,"holy crap! aimbotters everywhere ! .. in my 2 games played i encountered several botters and even a few using wall hacks to walk up walls.. 
good mechanics though"
20182,"Typical FPS. Good game, easy to play and seems to keep getting updates from the devs. Big plus to this game is it doesn't take much to run and have a good time"
20183,add me  iam  play 20h  best game we neeed team
20184,"This game works fine as a free Call of Duty multiplayer clone although lacks the perk and killstreak mechanics, making combat in this game simpler, but also more uninteresting, compared with CoD.
 
Progression is rather slow, the game gives you enough to purchase a few guns when you start off but then it takes a while for you to make that money back. Slow progression was obviously implemented to persuade gamers to buy the ""premium"" currency, which I find hilarious because the game's info explicitly states that is ""not pay to win"".

Maps felt unbalanced to me, there was one map where I could aim down a staircase and just mow the enemy team down, fortunately there is spawn-protection but you can position yourself so close to the enemy spawn that it's nearly useless.

One positive is the robust servers, I've experienced less serverside lag on this game than on Black Ops 3 (most likely because there are nowhere as near many players on this game)

Pick this game up if you want a simple, fast FPS but aren't willing to invest money in one."
20185,"-If you really have a game that is so unbalanced that newcomers will be put off by the gameplay, it is bullshit, hitting an enemy in the face 12 times only for them to turn the corner and 2 shot you because they had that big of an advantage, it is rage inducing, not fun and most importantly not good game design. It's fine if weapons have niches, not monarchies.
-The movement is clunky, map design is shit, oh and don't get me started on the interface, when you say it gives me a ""key guide"" I want to see the keys so I can skip the shitty, glitchy, laggy, rough and not very helpful tutorial, which teaches you about things YOU CAN'T EVEN ACCESS!!
-There is potential, but the way I see it any of these points would ruin a game and this game hit each possiblity.
If you want a fun balanced FPS try CS GO, for a weird unbalanced addictive one try TF2.
Valve, Battlefield and Call of Duty already beat Black Squad decades in advance."
20186,"sad for only 64 bit os:((
"
20187,"The game is okay for what it is, but im not sure if i can call it fair gunplay considering the weapons you can bring from class choices, there is a mode where you gotta destroy bases (and thats the only mode i know that people play) where you get these powerfull abilities based on what class you pick and things like being a juggernaut with a big minigun and airstrikes going everywhere makes it hard to wanna play, whether its if im bad or if the style of play is bad, one things for sure i cannot play for more than 30 minutes before i get tired of it.

Some of the things to say the least has been done right that i am aware of, there is nothing in the shop that is pay to win, and the graphics are pretty good, and shotguns are actually underpowered if you can believe that, so there also isnt corner campers, however there is claymores everywhere and with how fast you die you cant pay attention to claymores and kill the enemy at the sametime so its either death by a thousand year rain of claymores, or die trying to stop people from mining the entire area which is impossible.

Eitherway i guess in a general standpoint its not a horrible game, i could be just bad and need todo better, but being bombed every 5 seconds from explosives is kind of hard to deal with from the very beginning, i give this game a sort of 50/50 kind of rating, isnt good, isnt bad in my eyes.. but dont let me discourage you from playing this alot of people have put positive reviews on this but this review is mostly to tell you what you are gonna be getting into."
20188,How to win: Jump around spraying your gun and nade spam every round.
20189,Great
20190,"This game is better that a lot of other FPS games that you have to pay for. It is def not AAA quality, but it is a good game. Def worth a look."
20191,"Eerst vond ik dit spel geweldig en was er goed in.
pos:
Snelle actie
Mooie wapens
Goede graphics
Snelle laadtijden
Geen lag
Maar nu is het niet leuk meer om te spelen.
Neg:
Hacks, cheats.
Voor de gewone gamer is dit geen uitdaging meer als je geen hacks hebt."
20192,AMAZING! and its only in ealy access and its FREE wow whats it gonna be like when its released!
20193,good game !!
20194,"Just check for your self. 

https://steamcharts.com/app/654180#7d


june 15 2020 and still no working battle eye, still lobby's loaded with cheaters, still worst game on steam. here i thought after a year from it the devs would have realized how to run the game but nope. they honor cheaters! this game needs to be removed ASAP from steam. tons of us have put in to steam to have it removed. DON'T DOWNLOAD, ITS A WASTE OF YOUR TIME."
20195,"I played this expecting a free to play no pay to win CoD game and as such i was both right and wrong and here's why:

the weapons are really overpowered and as such you need to chose the right weapon for you in the begining becourse it will take alot of time to get a new weapon (btw you don't need to buy the weapon in the match like CSGO but you can only choose from 3 premade sets that you put together) so choose wisely becourse you get 1 for free when you enter. 

it's got the elementh from both CoD and CSGO and as such the ""Brawl"" game mode is kind like trash but it's a little fun if you don't have anything else. so i enjoyed it but you need alot of skill to not be a burden for your teamates.

all in all quite good but don't expect much since its in early development."
20196,"This game is quite similar to CS:GO(Not sure about COD).I have also heard that its also similar as battlefield.Its a fun game to play and you should get it if u cant afford CS:GO.It is also similar to Critical Ops,which is similar as CS:GO"
20197,"Having played this game for 6 minutes I can tell you that it has some potential, but it's really not that good. Considering that there are other really good FPS out there like CS and six siege I don't see any point to playing this. On top of that this is really just CS:GO and COD smashed together in unreal engine."
20198,its a mix of call of duty and raibow six siege and csgo i do enjoy it
20199,"I like this game and the staff tries to make Black Squad better but this game gets worse and is not recommend for people who likes to play solo atm:
- playing solo in quickmatch because you often play against a premade team
- auto balance is bad when soloing (ex. 1vs4 at the beginning of the game)
- no beginner mode for noobs
- unable to chat with the team when dead
- nerfs make guns useless and not viable anymore
- the SMG class is nerfed too much, extremely limited to close range and cant even compete in it against AK12 or SR/AK47 or even other good guns. imo, the SMG class was balanced before because it didnt have the grenade launcher. nevertheless, mobility doesnt matter much in this game so that there is no reason to pick up the SMG class when you are as fast as a sniper at a certain point at the beginnning of the round
- AK12 and SR/AK47 are easier to play than any other guns because they are OP because of their 1 shot headshot and 3 body shots ability (no, my k/d is not 0.8 and I spray my AK12 to get ezpz random headshots)
- the hitbox is still not fixed and a hit on the upper leg is still a torso hit
- the mouse sens is changed to 5 in the middle of the game randomly when a round starts
- last update resetted all settings although it was mentioned that we should only screenshoot our mouse sens
- the ping limit of 220 is still too high for EU
- the kill hud is still noticeable delayed when killing someone
- too much side recoil on laser/balanced guns or even on SMG so that they cant compete against high recoil guns which can be bursted or tapped easily
- ADS while moving is OP and even much more OP which crouching
- sometimes grenades bug into the wall and explode there
- smoke grenades are not covering well and the FOV allows you to look through them sometimes
- medals can be obtained by spending IRL money which is unfair as a beginner who does not play much because the better guns or all pistols are in the medal shop
- some players teleport
- grenades are not permanent in your inventory
- you can drop from higher areas without the drop sound
- the profit for selling weapons is too low
- the run and gun map is horrible and cant be removed when playing quickmatches
- lobby isnt responsive sometimes (server lag?)
- female characters are glowing and dont have a visible outline like the regular free character so that it's a p2win item atm"

20202,"One of the best free ""FPS"" games, But still need some improving"
20203,How come when I click start the game exits and nothing happens? Please help me.
20204,"Overall its fun a bit of the same ole same ole crap. Id give it a thumbs up if there wasnt a hacker in EVERY game you play..
"
20205,"Game play look like AVA but dont have sprint , guns easier to shoot than AVA , and easier to boring than AVA

20206,"they should fix hot boxes becuase i am a sniper guy that gets pissed when poeple push me so i like to take them out but most of the time i hit them point blank and yet they dont die, please update, and all its a really cool game when i 1v1 friends, i recomend it"
20207,I see GREAT potential in this game
20208,"It's flawed but it's free.

That will be all."
20209,"It's like Call of Duty without the cancer included. 

10/10"
20210,"It's worth giving a shot. At the moment there isn't a ton of games modes or  guns available for free, I wouldn't call it it a pay to win game but if you are willing to put some money into it you would definitely have an advantage gunwise. Also I've had problems saving my keybinds and ultimately that's what made me delete the game, it's really annoying having to remap crouch to C EVERYTIME you start the game. If you can get past this, the gameplay itself isn't bad. 6/10 for effort"
20211,nice
20212,"Should you get the game?

Pros: 

- Headshots Matter
- Fun gamemodes
- Easy to pickup. (IMO)
- All weapons are obtainable without spending any IRL cash. (Its easier to pay for it though.)
- Fun to play with friends.
- Really cool mehanics.
- Lot of weapons. (Although some are almost the same with a different visual)

Cons:

- Grinding is teidous.
- Not that many maps.
- Battle is repetitive. (Only 1 map)
- You dont get enough XP from.

Conclusion:

This is a great game, but needs improvements, the devs are still updating the game so you should try it out."
20213,"IM LOVING IT!
GET IT! ITS HELLA FUN!"
20214,Dat's racist!
20215,This is a good game :)
20216,Git gud. It would be nice if they had ESL tournaments and etc in this game :) Maybe a idea for future . But still great game
20217,shite
20218,"I adore this game at the moment... It isn't a pay to win game, there isn't an OP weapon that everybody abuses to level... The only 'advantage' you can get in rounds is power ups lets call them... You can pick your class and get points for playing the round... They range from rpgs to airstrikes and sentries... There are much more!
9/10"
20219,"tihis game is the best! I love it! Pls, more uptades!"
20220,this game is to good for free
20221,you have to equip knives to stab. you have to equip grenades to throw them. 0/10 gave me cancer.
20222,Needs more improvement but great game CSGO like COD
20223,"This is some really janky stuff. It's another mediocre Korean game with terrible sound effects (seems like everything has only one sound effec that is repeated ad nauseum) and average visuals. Movement and camera effects make it feel like a slow 90's quake. Maps are hilariously small. It's a mindless shooter grindfest. Nothing like CS:GO or CoD, so I don't know why other reviews were saying anything like that. Just one more company perpuating the trend that Korean companies can not make decent video games."
20224,great game so far
20225,"Still a lot of things to improve, but has everything to be a very good game in the future"
20226,"Very satisfying game I must say.

- The blood effects and the sounds look and sound very realistic
- Doesn't try to be anything too special (which is good) 

Oh did I say this game is satisfying.... well sure."
20227,"This is an early access game? DAMNNNNNN. Better than many, many full, paid-for games. From the moment you start the game you can already see a lot of great features, like the free 15-day trial of most of the guns in the game or the wide variation of gameplay. However, this game isnt for graphic junkies, as they are average at best. Yet for a free, early-access game this is a must own in my opinion for shooter fans. 9.5/10"

20237,"This game is the BASE of fps,every FPS game should be like this,not like COD has weird jetpacks or stuff,The best free FPS you can find on Steam.CS:GO is almost the same."
20238,"This game is shit. Full of cheaters, and also definitely pay to win unless you want to grind for a month to buy one new gun."
20239,Great game alittle mix of CSGO and COD plus it's free.
20240,recomanded because its very good and i dont any graphics card to play my graphics card has gone to fixing but i can play it on very low setting with no lag!
20241,Garbage
20242,Delete nades from this fucking game
20243,"Trash game, guns are bad."
20244,goood
20245,"The idea itself is not new at all: CS:GO has the same goal, Warface has the same inventory setup (paying for weapons).
However, this way of obtaining weapons puts non-paying players at a disadvantage, since the weapons you can get if you have money are a lot better and this affects the whole game, not to mention the granade launcher, of which we can see the effect in CoD-MW in Hardcore matches. One word: cancerous...Just as the behaviour of the Beta testers. If you pay attention to the chat you can see the use of vulgar language written carefully with the most advanced grammar there is, mostly coming from paying players.
All in all, I think the game will be a terrible version of CS:GO and even less fun than Warface after a month. If this will be F2P there might be new people joining in but if not, well..."
20246,"Game has more potential than a Filipino Senior High-School Student, UI is a bit cluttery and unorganized but gameplaywise there is loads of room for improvement."
20247,0/10 misleading name no black squad to be found only a group of 8 year old asian boys
20248,Devs are to busy adding pay to win guns and stupid waifu models for the 11 year olds to jerk off to that they cant make an Australian server... no matter how many times you contact them and no matter how you contact them they do not listen and will NEVER fix actuall issues. terribly greedy game that is unplayable for anyone who doesn't live in a country with a server.
20249,uninstall button works perfectly fine
20250,"Very fun, little to no hostility from players"
20251,"Quite Fun Game and Not Really That Stress Compare to Other Compertative Games Such As Dota and Especially CSGO(They In The Same Category As FPS,Obviously)
Pros-
-Nice Graphic
-Very Leisure
-Multiple Game Mode
-Create Clan For FREE 
-All Guns Can Be Purchase With In-game Money,Just Need To Use Some of Your Time,Wifi,And Electric LOL(Skin Are Available But The Original Gun Can Be Purchase With Points Instead of Real Cash (All black hahaha)
Cons-
-Clan Battle Are DYING Even Thought This Is A New Game Lol
-In Game Support Button Needed(Should Be Fix Soon Enough So I Think No Problem)
-Community Are Not....Talking,Speaking nor Chating as if I Am Playing Alone With Some Single Player FPS Game(Can't Blame The Company Though,Because This Is Not Quite A Harsh Compertative Game Yet)
-No Scope Are Not Possible Because Shoot Without Scope Will Randomly Shot Somewhere,Quite Not Logic(Maybe There IS Logic I Donno XD)
-Team Work Is Not Possible(All People Run On Their Own Way),In Game Voice Chat Is Not Been Promote Properly(I don't even know if there a voice chat or not),Too Unorganized

20252,"If you're looking for good shooter game, try to play this one. All weapons are permenant except for grenades."
20253,"The game is cool but it needs recoil fixing.I made 1v5 with the started weapons(F1).As a quitting Counter-Strike player i like it.Graphics are nice, hud is cool, game for some casual players seeking what to do when they are bored.I will say 7/10.
Needs recoil fixing and some bugs i found when playing.Its cool and nice you should try out."
20254,"Very good fps, thats it. GO FOR IT, its free bruh"

20266,"Bullets are the P2W currency in this game, thats good because I need a loaded gun to shoot myself"
20267,"Its kind of an odd choice to be a CS:GO clone especially with having ADS in the game but its not bad. But with all F2P shooters you're going to run into a lot of cheaters and this game has a ton of them. Id say almost every game theres one and it gets obnixious fast. That said, the biggest issue is how many 200-250 ping players there are. Even after the Asia server theres just too many. Too many times youll run into someone you have to put an entire clip into and they may still kill you before you kill them. Its actually worse than dealing with cheaters."
20268,"Great Free 2 play Game. Obviously a lot better than the older F2P games like S.K.I.L.L every other f2P games i have played.
Most of the Pros outweights the cons in this game.

The only thing im dissapointed is the fact that theres no solo vs solo players in quick matches. Quick matches on Demolition mostly ends up on me having a full on solo queue team vs a full lobby level 2 rape squad

Nexon Pls fix / still a good game though"

Gameplay: 2/10
Sounds: 5/10
Multiplayer: 4/10
Graphics: 8/10

[h1][b]Pros & Cons[/b][/h1]
- Painfully generic
- Below average voice acting
- Average gunplay
- Average map design
- No weapon customization
- Awful netcode
+ Good animations
+ Good weapon detail & graphics
+ Not Pay-2-Win

[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]
Blacksquad was recently released, but it feels like its been here before...1000 times. The game is so painfully generic with barely any redeeming qualities. No weapon customization, check. No innovative gameplay elements, check. Every-single-generic/boring-fps-gamemode-out-there, check. The visuals are good, however but they conflict with the average sound effects and badly voiced characters. It's a free game so give it a shot, but you've played this game before.

[h1]3/10[/h1]"
20270,"Absolute garbage, waste of time and hard drive space."
20271,"Get it, don't get it, it's free, it's actually fun and enjoyable. Why not, right?

Just before you start questioning the fact that I'm writing a review with under 30 min (now 4,5 hours) spent on the game, hear me out, okay?

So the game is actually really enjoyable. For someone who doesn't have money for Black Ops or CS:GO, or any FPS-game whatsoever, this F2P game is really worth downloading. 

For me it's really fun playing since I, who's not too shabby of a CS:GO player, I find the game rather easy to play. Not to brag or anything but I did get 50+k second game. :)"
20272,"Going into it with friends, we expected a crappy, buggy, p2w bootleg Counter-Strike that we could play for an hour at best and laugh at how bad it was. We were very pleasantly surprised to learn that not only the game DOES NOT HAVE ANY P2W BULLCRAP but it is an incredibly well made and fun tactical shooter.
The guns are all balanced, look and feel good, the graphics are very damn pretty for a free game (the game is on Unreal Engine 4 so no surprise there) and the sounds are powerful and visceral. Overal, it's a very strong game with loads of content that doesn't require you to lighten your wallet to enjoy it. The only obvious problem was the convoluted UI, but other than that, I can't say anything terrible about the game.

TL;DR The game is amazing for what it is. If you're looking for a free alternative to CS without any P2W, definitely give this game a try."

20274,"Update 1/24/2018

Neowiz hired CMs aka gestapo who have no knowledge of the game and probably dont even play it to police the social media and community in the game. 5 months later still has been 0 actual patches to the game other than shipping skin related content from korea. NA scene is all but dead and servers have degraded to an almost unplayable point. Pretty sure BattleEye is not working or even on anymore they probably stopped paying for it since it's expensive and they clearly don't give a shit about this game. I would need to see some serious evidence to show BE is actually implemented and working because when I do occasionally hop on there are pretty blatant togglers/wallers going on. Neowiz Paid streamers to play the game but continue to ignore their already existing streamer base who been at it since day 1. They did finally add a section on discord that tells you when partners are streaming but it's in an obscure location with no notifcation so unless you scroll all the way down to see it you'll never know it's there. Meanwhile if any staff go live on their ""personal channels"" that have nothing to do with the game theyll tweet that shit out and spam it all over partner/official disord in everyones face. 

I highly advice anybody looking into this game to stay away. Neowiz has made their intention as a company clear and BTW this game has been dead on Korea since 2016. They had a 4 month contract to broadcast the competitive matches but it died out because no one gave a shit about it. This game is as DEAD on Korea server as it is NA. Just brought this up because seen lot misinformed people talking about how this games a Esport in korea. IT was for 4 months.. 2 years ago and their game has drastically different mechanics than our which include weapon tagging that we don't have. Any streamers who got contacted about streaming this game please actually research the kind of shit you're advertising and read.



Subject to change.

So after 300+ hours decided to finally do a review. Also keep in mind most of the positive reviews are people with Sub 3 hours play time. That's like... 5-6 Games and some menu camping. Also lot of the higher hour reviews are done by the developers and Moderators trying to fluff their own reviews... Atleast change your names and try to hide it's you.. NOTLIKETHIS.

positives:
-Free
-Will have steam market integration soon hopefully so I can sell my skins and get my money back for wasting so much time with this game.
-Has potential to be a great game.
-Great for Casual players who don't want a game with high learning curve like CS or OW

Negatives:
-Korean company that almost tanked after ruining the original game in korea farming money with this version
-Early access despite Korean version being out for 2 years so just another excuse to deliver half finished product and slowly milk money out of us
-Competitive scene is 5% known cheaters 94% failed rejects who couldn't make it outa ESEA open who quit CSGO/Siege/OW to be mediocre in this low skill ceiling FPS. 1% are actually good solid players but they know better then to take this game overly seriously.
-QM has no rating system and half time you're 1v5ing. Solo players get qued into full 5 stacks pretty much on regular
-Game has progressively gotten worse with every update and last 2-3 updates were nothing but Skins/Gun additions/Cash Box changes. While the servers get worse and worse and NA server is riddled with Asian players despite them having their own server
-Ping... so the netcode in the game caters to high ping compensation allowing people with 80+ ping to have a peeker advantage over everyone else. This is why the Asian community feels its necessary to play on the NA servers despite having 300+ ping because it allows them to basically see you first and shoot you first through walls and other objects not to mention they teleport across your screen and damage dump you. Developers seem to be at an impossible junction where if they Region lock QM servers they lose a majority of their games playerbase which is Asia by all accounts.
-Game was more competitive and Esport ready in the early beta phases and has progressively become more and more casual with the removal of recoil patterns and Tagging. Skill ceiling for the game is extremely low which is why there are so many self proclaimed ""pros"" in the game atm who are C- 8 RWS career ESEA players in a real game called Counter strike.
-Tactical depth to the game is severely lacking as the Maps designs are some of the worse I've ever seen. Questioning whether the map designer for this product has even played a competitive shooter before. Smokes and Flashbangs have limited use making the majority of the game 1:1 Aim duels. Meaning the compeitive potential for this game is extremely low and most likely will get boring and old after a 2-3 month binge then die out.
-Community managers dick ride established well known streamers and content producers who play the game for maybe 1 day then never touch it again. They also dick rode a team of known Cheaters who cheated people out of cup wins for almost a month and were given free items only to later be banned by Battle Eye *FacePalm*. Let's not even start at the unprofessional weekly twitch stream they do where they spend 60% of the stream shit talking negative reviews on the steam page.
-Instead of taking feedback from the higher level competitive players they continue to just do random game changes that make 0 sense like removing Tagging from all the guns in the game during the Closed beta and making 80% of the guns laser beams. 
-Early Cash boxes were extremely rigged and later the developers even admitted to it and slowly began increasing rewards drastically from the boxes but failed to compensate any of the early box openers who spent money basically screwing over a large majority of the community.
-30 tick rate servers... Word is the new competitive channel will have higher tick rate and be better overall servers than whats currently been given to us but every patch the servers get worse and worse and I've even teleported randomly with 20 ping before. Not sure if this is related to the extra strain the server goes through to host all the 300+ ping players who still haven't been locked out of the server they dont belong in yet.
-Community expresses how much it hates SMG and how they ruin the game and Developers respond by adding another SMG into the game a week later and actually somehow messing up a patch that was literally 95% skins + 1 gun and the gun had old coding from closed beta where tagging was still implemented.

Overall:
I've invested into the game and hoped for its pontential to shine through. Things started off great but it's becomming more and more clear that the priority for Neowiz is the Korean version. This is just a cash grab in order to get the Korean version pumping again. How Steam can allow them to market this as Early access when all the content is already created and existing in the Korean version that has existed for over 2 years is beyond me. The games skill celing is low and to be honest most of the actual good players have already quit. The only people who are gonna continue to grind this game are going to be the casual players and the low skill players who find success here because of the low skill ceiling. Most of the predictions I made about this game have come true. Playerbase is slowly decreasing more and more everyday and I don't see this Game making it past January with any more than 3-4k players which is a 70% decrease from what it started with. By the time the game maybe becomes competitive ready and starts actually hosting competitive leagues and tournaments with proper Anti cheat and prize money it'll most likely be too late and this'll just become another AVA or SF2 and have a very small dedicated competitive scene of slightly above average players who seem to flock to these f2p shooters like flies to a steamy pile of dogshit."
20275,Fantastic shooter with very solid gun play. Every gun I've used has felt strong and the over all experience has left me wanting more. For a Free To Play experience you could do way worse than Black Squad. You owe it to yourself to give it a try.
20276,"A fun free to play and so far not pay to win (paid items are skins etc). 
"
20277,"only snipe
"
20278,"It's really hard to rate for this game because is made by Unreal Engine And i think the NS STUDIO is not 100% use unreal engine but hey this is unreal engine  Yeah is use unreal engine but not that ""unreal"" it can making better with unreal engine"
20279,Not good
20280,dope
20281,Amazing
20282,"Alt + F4 not working. I can't ragequit this game.

Also game mechanics feels cheap. Every single gun is like just shoot enough and hope someone die. Some weapons don't even have recoil. Btw why do I hear everyone yelling about reloading his weapon? And it happens very often. Its annoying.

Only thing that is good about this game is its not pay to win."
20283,Have Fun if You are Competitve Cooldown ahahaha
20284,I fuck cheater
20285,Nice game
20286,"Like MACCAS , IM BLOODY LOVING THIS GAME"
20287,"The damage model is what keeps me coming back. The game has its little quirks but its nice you dont have to empty a magazine into someone to kill them. I like the basic ""grind and buy your weapons"".  I wish you could buy the attachments instead of them being preset. Excited to see new maps and maybe bigger maps along with more equipment and character upgrades."
20288,I rate this game 10\10 it's the best f2p non p2p game of the year
20289,"New update messed some things up. 

- My settings (key-bindings, sound, sensitivity) all got reset.
- Lag during games (Delay on reloading, shots not connecting, jumping frames).
- Complete server dc's.

Not a very good update, hope they'll fix everything soon because it's not really playable atm."
20290,Great
20291,"After watching a fellow AVA player getting banned TWICE (on his main and on his alternate account), I honestly cannot put my faith into Neowiz and that trust is breaking apart greatly. This sets a precedent in the case that if you are too good at the game, you can get banned at any point and the casuals who report you will get you banned in no time, even if you are not even cheating at all. What's the point of BattlEye if the other people can report your account and the odds of it getting banned will be greater thanks to this example? 

This game is a complete joke now. I cannot recommend this game until the developers address this matter, in which I have very low hopes that will be resolved properly.
"
20292,been playing for 5 hours already... so i know when someone is playing using a cheat... please make a report button for people to make a report instantly.. thanks...
20293,"By far one of the better F2P FPS games out with absolutely no p2w which is great.  Yes there are still things needing to be worked out with the game, but they are working on them week by week which should be expected in a pre release game.  I have put in over 1100 hours in game since it was released last year. if you do decide to give it a try have patience and learn the game and adjust your settings accordingly.  If you need any help add me on steam or in game Xx19xX i dont mind helping.     Hope to see you in game, happy fragging  edit IGN is now TTV*CrucifixFPS"
20294,"This game is like call of duty and counter strike had a child, Black Squad. The game is amazing especially since it is free. To be honest when I downloaded this I thought that the graphics and game play would be worse than csgo source. But It surprised me after I played the tutorial. Sometimes it pisses me off on the speed of the players and how fast they could stafe it is almost like using the scout in team fortress 2. But overall it is a great game and it just takes a little bit of time to get used to."
20295,"solid old COD clone, fun, free!"
20296,"This game was similar with csgo but it was more easier to play for newbie ..it was combination two game ,CSGO +COD"
20297,bad call of duty type game
20298,"Horrible game.  Nothing about it is innovative; If anything, it's taking steps backwards in terms of first person shooters.  Running with your knife out makes you faster?  What is this, 1999?  The only thing going for this game is the graphics.  What are you guys applauding?  It being free?"
20299,"its a awesome game ,only the lottery system sux i spend 1200 bullets on them and only got 500 bs points and 500 medals no guns no nothing ! please do increase the chance to win some of these nice weapons 

anyways i wont be spending anymore money on it until we are gauranteed to get some nice weapons"
20300,bad game
20301,"I love this GAME!!! It's like im playing COD:black ops on PC.
The game gives of a COD vibe"
20302,"Un muy buen juego que seria un mix entre cod y cs go. la jugabilidad es optima porque los servers estan bien distribuidos por region entonces practicamente no hay lag ni ping alto, ademas, cuenta con una gama de armas muy amplia y todas se pueden adquirir (aunque jugando por largo rato-_-!) en lineas generales yo lo recomiendo, y esperemos que con el tiempo no se transforme (como la mayoria de los free fps) en un p2w game xq esto a la larga termina matando este tipo de juegos.

edit: a la fecha es puro p2w con un lag terrible no lo recomiendo para nada..."

20304,Free to play?  This game is so underrated.   One of the best FPS game I've ever played.  Realistic guns make this game so attractive and enjoyable.  Although it needs some fix for lags and disconnect.  But it's still fine tho.  Now we have an asian server so I m fine with lags now.
20305,i ts nice game
20306,"I hated this i highly dont recomend this
"
20307,"What can i say, its a SOLID game"
20308,"It's not a pay-to-win game, the graphics and mechanics are decent, there are plenty of stuff to go around with but all that doesn't matter once you get raped by 10 levels higher players who somehow ALWAYS happen to be your opponents. Grenade spam, broken headshot system and huuuuge unbalance between teams make this game a rage-cooking machine.

If you have strong nerves, sure, go ahead and play it but if you are a normal human being, skip this one."
20309,"A really fun arcade styled game extremely similar to CS:GO as the bullets fire directly out of your head (from the crosshair) rather than from the barrel of the gun in games like PUBG*. It might keep you occupied for a good hour or so per day but you might lose interest in it if you don't play with a friend. There are 3-4 modes so it will just be a matter of time until you're bored and looking to play some other game again.

* - PUBG stands for Player Unknown's Battlegrounds"
20310,"Easily one of the worst free to play fps games, just tries to be blacklight, cs go, cod and any other free to play shooter where you buy coinc for guns u get to keep for a couple days."
20311,"ok
"
20312,its amazing game
20313,"I like this becuase its easy to use the controls. I recommend this game to everyone thats only if you like shooter games 
"
20314,"Just another FPS build on the crappy Unreal Engie 3, which is not designed for a Tactical Shooter like  this. *clap* *clap*"
20315,"Nice game, Recommend!"
20316,"Good, Laggy.. lots of fix needed. Gameplay is Quite good."
20317,đc đếy
20318,"Rant: I would recommend the game if your just looking for a time killer, though if you are looking for a game you wish to player for a year or more than this game isnt it. Spent couple hours on it and I was having fun. Then I started ranking up and saw that I was ungeared. Looking through the store you will see there are I think 5 currencies in game. SIlver, BS, Medals, R, and bullets. That in my eyes is freaking ludicrous. This game says its not pay to win but in orget to get the amount of silver you need you would have to play alot, in order to get medals you have to play alot, in order to get BS, well i dont even know how the frick you would get that. Bullets is trade from real money to in game currency. Back to what I was saying, this game says its nt pay to win but, you need alot of one of those currencies to get any good crap in game. I got one sniper rifle because they give you money for doing tutorials. Im sorry I dont feel like playing tutorials, I want to kill people. All these people will have better weapons than you, and you will see that when you level up. I could shoot a guy several times in the head with a assult rifle, but when he does it I die. This game is a load of bs, ""were not pay to win"" -_- yeah right. Also a ""First Sargent"" Rank has Three Chevrons and Three Rockers with a diamond in the middle. 

Conclusion: Personally I do not take this game serious, so I do not recommend it. If they fixed the in game currencies and made it easier to aquire weapons then I would consider recommending it. Hey its just my opinion, play it and find out for yourself, it might change, it might not. You might have a different expierence.  
"
20319,"If you are into FPS games, I would recomend you give this a try. Fun modes to play. Definately not a pay to win game. I am getting hours of enjoyment from it."
20320,The developers are great about updating weekly and trying to adress the concerns that players like us have.  The only thing i feel thatneeds to be changed and updated is the max ping cap it seems like people with 400 ping have the advantage and it shouldnt be that way.  The guns stats are fair for the most part.  I do have to see they need a report button feature for all the hatred and racism you see from players its pretty harsh.
20321,wallbangs are too op
20322,I honestly really like the game but it has some problems and it wont let my mouse move. So once they get this game fixed ill actually like it again.
20323,I tested this game at 2 completely different times of day with great internet and this game is just a huge lag fest. The game is cool. The  lag is not. Literely all to say
20324,Needs improvement but it's a pretty decent game.
20325,very good fps game

20328,Nice Game but cant talk with people other then in chat
20329,Games that are free have some hidden cost but this is not true in this game... this is truely a free to play game. Its a mix of all the Triple A title FPS games that are out there and its super fun to play on your own or with your friends. I recommend playing the TDM. Try it out for yourselfs and get addicted to it
20330,"Great fun but needs drastic changes if it wants to be big, it has huge potential though.

Suggestions for changes

https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackSquad/comments/71zf93/black_squad_feedback_and_suggestions/"
20331,"Really awesome game, mix of a classic 'Counter Strike', 'Call of Duty 4' and 'Battlefield: Bad Company 2' with some unique features. Game code well written, had zero lags and freezes within six hours of straight play in different modes.

Overall graphics and animations quality on a decent level, everything looks smooth and well-detailed.

Gameplay itself consist of team only modes - classic 'team deathmatch', 'demolition' and 'assassination' similar to a bomb defuse and VIP-escort from a CS1.6 and 'destruction', similar to  a 'rush' from BF:BC2. Plus, theres few optional rulesets, such as 'rifles/shotguns/knives only' or a 'survival' version of TD with disabled respawns.

Game modes, maps and inventory balanced nearly perfectly, comparing to a similar games. Most maps are symmetrical in terms of walkable path (but not in terms of textures, theres no copy-paste of same buildings, roads and static things) and key objects  in 'destruction' mode.

The only asymmetrical maps are made for  a 'demolition' and 'assassination' modes and Id like to point that maps for a local 'bomb defuse' mode created with higher quality comparing to Counter Strike: Source or even Global Offence maps, and feeling much more accurate and tactically rich, reminding best maps from CS1.6.

Each gun have unique stats (within 0-100 range). Theres no uber 'pay2win' guns at all, every gun have own strengths and weaknesses. For example you can pick very accurate or fast-shooting rifle, but with a small overall damage, few powerful rifles with nearly twice as much damage, but with an awful recoil as well. 
[i]Personally I prefer G36GL since its a well-balanced gun both in terms of damage and usability.[/i]

The only weird thing is that all grenades (HE, smoke and flash) are temporary and require periodical repurchase, while all guns you can buy - always permament, requiring one-time purchase only. Luckily this is not a problem at all, since 15000 free coins being given every day, and this sum more than enough to buy all types of grenades.

Immediately after registering a nickname (no e-mail, date of birth and other info needed) youll recieve 200000 coins plus 15000 within daily event. This money is more than enough to buy 1-2 new guns (which are being sold for in-game currency and real money).


[i]I was able to recieve around 80000 coins after six hours of play in a different modes, and common prices for a gun in a store - 95000\120000 coins so its more than fair deal [/i]

Moreover, theres no hardcore money grind like in a similar 'f2p' games, youll recieve coins and medals for a daily and weeky events (daily check-ins and total played time for a whole week respectively), level ups as well as for every finished match.

Additional advantage of a 'Black Squad' - game being protected by a 'BattleEye', really effective anti-cheat tool comparing to an awful 'PunkBuster' or a passive 'VAC'.

The only problem that can occur - awfully bad or selfish teammates on your side, since theres only quantity autobalancer, not a skills-based autobalancer. For a 'team deathmatch' and 'demolition' this is not a real problem, since everything depends on your sole skills and due to a lagless servers (at least european one) and proper hitboxes its possible to outsmart and outplay even few enemies, paving the headshots road to victory.

The only mode, in which success depends on luck and random than on skills - 'destruction'. This mode looks alike 'CoD4' and 'BF:BC2' combo in terms of gameplay, with four different classes, possiblity to accamulate special points for each portion of damage you was able to inflict, which later might be traded on different one-time abilities, such as mines and grenade launchers, healing and ammopacks, fieldscan and bombardments. The one and the only objective - to get rid of all enemy command posts, which is impossible without decent team play.

In conclusion Id like to say that I tried many 'F2P' games such as 'Operation7', 'Crossfire', 'Counter Strike: Nexus', 'Tactical Intervention', but 'Black Squad' was the only properly made and properly balanced grindless game among those I have played. Thus, I highly recommend to play this game."
20332,"[h1] REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE TEAM BALANCE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE [/h1]

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[i] REE continues on for some time.  [/i]

OK. That's done. I'll get straight to it. The game is well, great. But you're probably wondering why I put ""REEE"". I'll get to that. Anyway, the game is easy, even a noob like me can get kills, all guns can be obtained with playing, NO MICROTRANSACTIONS, thank god, the guns are decently balanced, and the [i] class system [/i] is not even a class system at all. 

[b] Class System : [/b] Not aa class system. It's just that in some game modes, after you get one kill, you get to choose from a ste of abilities (four sets). While playing, you gain points for doing things (kills, captures, assists) and theese points are used real-time to use the abilities (like a power bar, building up to special attack). The abilities use points, and out of 4abilities per set, you only unlock abilities by in-game ranking up (leveling up).

[b] Team Balancing; [/b] They can't balance teams. They say auto-team balance, but they don't balance. One team is noob, other team is pro. All I have to say about that is REEEEEEEE. It's playable otherwise."

You couldn't get more stress from this game cuz your team is fucking shit"

20336,"-everyone is spamming grenades
-hackers
-  sometimes random freezes while in game even if i have a good net speed and PC
- bad ping in some servers
- you get bored too fast 
but if you're a f2p player and you can't offer to buy better games then it's okey to spend your time on it! 
it's 100% free 2 play after all"
20337,its a shit
20338,Controls dont work! suck ass!
20339,Awesome Game
20340,"on my laptop this game has serious mouse lag problem,..FPS drop from 60FPS+ to 1-2FPS when moving mouse (Fps drop speed belong to how fast you move your mouse),..can't play,...it only happens on my latop with external mouse,..Touchpad works well and my Desktop run this game very well with no problem,..i'll give this review until developer fixed that problem,.."
20341,update more gun and more scope please boring man
20342,TBH never thought this game would have been this fun . I went in not really having any expectations but it’s actually a really fun fking game; glad I got it.
20343,"Very fun game, Its like a mix between Counter Strike and Medal of Honor in my opinion."
20344,"it's definitely not pay to win 
I really like this game and will buy the founder pack as soon as i could 

However the game still has many problems like map design , LOW ANISTROPIC FILTERING , USELESS ANTIALIASING and NO ZOMBIE MODE .Imagine  a 32 player zombie pvp mode with special ability like in battle match mode ( except all the airstrike killstreak types ) and shits ... , damn i can't wait for that
zombie maps should have dark and creepy atmosphere just like in AVA , the zombies are mutated soldiers (just like in Crossfire ) or similar to the zombies in  counter strike nexon zombies . i really hate AVA's zombies

Should i leave this review as a negative for all the downsides that i mentioned above ?"
20345,Just another Game based on the UE3...sucks.
20346,It sucks dick.
20347,NEW FAV GAME ? I THINK SO

20351,"Pretty fun game, sorta like that game called phantom forces on roblox. BUT, it's a bit too pay to play, and you dont really unlock any new things while leveling up."

-Slow combat
-Few kits at start
-Too much microtransaction reliable
-No proning
-Too slow when walking

20354,"-Despite the fact that it says ''random map'', you'll be playing the same maps over and over and over and over and over again.
-Atrocious team balancing.
-Firearm mechanics that are questionable and unreliable at their very best.
-Extremely limited game modes.
-Poorly designed HUD and UI that is not designed for ease of use."
20355,no permanent grenades
20356,Really fun game i love the gameplay and the graphics are even legit.
20357,very good game love to play it
20358,9/10

20368,yes.
20369,"Wow this game is fun and addictive! I was looking for a new shooter to play and this game suprised me beyond my expectations. It's filled with a lot of snipers but overall it's a fun game. Thought it included a story mode but only pvp. No mic functionality is available, I hope they add that in soon. Also, you can't really group up with the same people unless you memorize their names from the matches. In other words, a not too social-friendly game if you ask me. 

This is similar to Warface if you've played it but 10x better hands down."
20370,"Lacks on things it needs to be hard on (Competitive, Equal playing Field) is very hard on things it should not be (skins, ""play"" to win)"
20371,wont let me get dlc :(
20372,I've spent no money on this game and I still feel like I've been ripped off
20373,Nothing but hackers... dont waste your time.
20374,"I came from Indonesia and back then I was playing a shooting game called Point Blank and maybe most asians know this game cuz Garena has this as well. This game is so nostalgic for me, it has the same feelings to it.
Overall this game is really good.
But now I live in New Zealand, so kind of need a new server in Australia."
20375,This game is ok for free. If you like to shoot someone like 8 times before they die and you die in one shot. Very good game to engage in rage quitting if that is what your into in a game.
20376,"this game is perfect
i enjoy it very much
i have put 15€ into this game to support the developers
much love,much respect"
20377,Very good game since I cant get csgo or cod this is like a sub

but there is one problem solo queue and party queue
there are times that i ended up on a team with 1 party on enemy side and sometimes I ended up with 4 players party

they need to fix it"
20381,This game is so fucking awesome. Love it <3
20382,"the game iz just awesome with the various modes available to play. + point for me was asian server, glitch free gaming at low ping. ultimate game easy to play and free. i will rate it better than cs go"
20383,Great game never had so much fun in a long time and the optimisation and gameplay is great.
20384,csgo sucks
20385,good game
20386,"Es uno de los mejores shooters que han salido desde hace mucho tiempo, tanto su forma de jugar, graficos y skin, ya hacia falta un juego como este. Tambien quiero destacar sus variedad de armas y su falta de bugs, lo que para un juego es muy importante.

Por otro lado, la optimizacion que tiene es increible al vez que sus pocos requesitos para ser jugado, este juego me gusta mucho y me encantaria que siguieran trabajando en el.

Psdt: El unico fallo o mejor dicho falta son servidores mejor distribuidos ya que las personas de latinoamerica sufrimos a veces, ya que si esas personas no viven muy cerca de brasil por ejemplo que es donde tienen un servidor el lag que pueden llegar a tener es tremendo, yo tengo un internet desentemente bueno y soy de chile y cuando empece a jugar no tenia problemas, pero ultimamente me va muy lageado(no el juego en si, si no que al entrar en servidores, porque los fps estan muy bien). Bueno esa es mi opinion sobre el juego y si pudieran solucionar ese pequeño problema, les prometo que estare muy agradecido.

Gracias por su atencion."
20387,neutral
20388,4/10 This game should be called overwellming simulator because all you do is run the whole time because there are just TOO many enemies.
20389,"Are you fed up with cs:go, lost interest and/or not having fun anymore?
You came to the right place."
20390,"A decent FPS game, no pay to win. A mix between CoD and cs. Better performance than CS GO."
20391,"Ridicilous pay to win mechanics,like it's not even trying to hide it,exclusive op weapons if you pay to buy them,this game is like designed to fail"
20392,"Worthy free alternative for famous game. First 50 hours you will have incredible fun, but then interest will start to fail you.
Says to be in early access, no idea how long it will last. For more play time it is still too dry.
Review updating. 
Your game is so poor that I can't even chose a server I want to play in. 
Your game is so bad that my steam disconnects even when I'm trying to launch your game. 
Your game is crap cuz every single first match I start my ping is always fucking 292!
Remove yourself devs, with this game.
Review updating. 01.12.2019 10:58
If you are lucky, some nice loot may be dropped.
06.05.2020 review udpate
Still not recommended. Ah, btw, if you wanna get some nice drop from this game. FORGET IT. First you'll have to donate millions dollars, then maybe... Oh, and if you want some premium quality stuff, first you'll have to ra.pe yourself by opening 100 cases. Yes, 100 fu.cking hundred cases. It's it's not a joke. Save yourselves! Run!!!"
20393,Theres nothing bad i can say about this game.... Just the best shooting game i played. Im playing non-stop since i download the game and probably still would until im old lol.. Definitely would recommend it to everyone.
20394,good game overall
20395,good gaem
20396,many of hackers  :(
20397,"Ok , so i decided to Edit this review , my opinion it's :
Pro:The anti cheat has updated and now the cheaters don't appears in matches.
I like the weapons but add more 
Contra:Sincerely i don't have contras"
20398,fps gamers out there this is the worst fps game ever you cant ever run with shift you need to push down scroll to run and brings out knife for a fucking reason second they let them to come to our spawn and we keep spawning the same spot and spawnkilling is easy third the guns sucks
20399,"Well made, Basiclly a cheap battlefield which is actually awesome
"
20400,I really love this game but can you guys change  the animation of Machetes plz? I really regret buying one because I thougth it was going to be the same animation as the last old game. plz change the animation to spinnging one
20401,Amazing game for free.
20402,Amazing game for free. Feels like a better version of cs go. An believe it or not this is not a pay to win game.
20403,trash game 1/10
20404,"I love the game, now that they've fixed the mouse glitch!"
20405,"Awesome game 
Simple to play 
The only thing that needs it's to be a little more clear on the inventory .. other than that awesome game 

If you like csgo cod and fps games u should download it and give it a go"
20406,"this game sucks, has serious problems with the mouse and glitches out all the time."
20407,Games great if you like getting hacked aka play against cheaters all day everyday.
20408,i very good free game hop[efully they will have aussie servers in future
20409,The game is a pay to win peice of shit. The ak 2 shots anywhere and one shots to the head while all other guns 7 shot to the chest and 4 shot to the head. Oh you have to buy the ak with in-game currency but it will take a month of getting stomped by people who payed real money for the ak.
20410,quite the shitty CSGO rip off here.
20411,"First and most important thing: NO P2W, AT ALL. The only thing you pay real money for are SKINS (just like in CSGO).  Great game to kill some time off. It works for both type of players: CS and COD. You can use the crosshair or the gun scope at any range with the exact same results depending on which type of fps you feel most comfortable with. Beware theres enough players who would get down on their knees as soon as they see you , constantly crouch (and walk crouched sometimes) or simply hide behind a box or in a corner and wait there happily. Just like in CSGO, watch your minimap at all times to spot them. If you dont want to appear on the enemy's minimap just use a silencer the whole time. Also the grenade launchers from the weapons are perfect if you think someone is hiding after a corner or in a room, just use the launcher before entering the room and you might kill the guy or seriously damage him."
20412,Great game. Especially with friends online!
20413,"The default controls are absoutely terrible, the sensitivity is a pain to set up. 
Once its all set up though, this is a fun game, its not pay to win, its face paced. 
*edited*"
20414,"Extraordinary f2p First-Person-Shooter! Classic Team-Oriented Close Combat, that plays like a perfect mix of Counter-Strike and Call of Duty. Right now development is very active, with weekly updates, wich offer gameplay enhancements, maps and new guns to play. You can get very unlucky in the ingame shop atm tho. Keep your eyes open if you goin to spend money. It's not quite there yet, but this could become the shooter I've been waiting for since Call of Duty 4"
20415,"TacReload. Says enough like come on so lame, even the miltaryt in real life would laugh at this!! Supposted to be a great military shooter but is just empty of guns but ill say theres lots of add ons for the guns you do get. Combat arms is way better as long as your not in a match with a hacker. Maybe in the futrue up dates it may get better and hopefully take out the dumb tac reload you keep hearing XD"
20416,"THIS GAME SUCKS. I can't even move my camera! In the pause menu, my mouse works fine, but ingame, i have to reset sensitivity controls and apply then it's ok, but as soon as i switch to another weapon, my mouse freezes again. WTF!

You can have the game, I probably won't play for awhile."
20417,Yoink (Great game btw)
20418,k
20419,"Great game, really fun and enjoyable. I like this game so much and i'm not even good lol
"
20420,The only thing i don't like about it is the fact that you can get spawn killed.
20421,Very good game like cs go but more fun
20422,I like it but i wish you could have more customization to the weapons but otherwise this game is very fun
20423,"Wow this is free ?! Try it, you will not lose anything and will not regret it for sure !

If you find CSGO boring and COD too childish , this is perfect mix. 
It is NOT pay to win, you get all weapons free 15+15 days as part of steam free dlc, 
In that time you can test them all out and make money to buy those you like !
Only microtransaction in game are for skins, NOTHING ELSE !

To be honest maps are small, but well done, it is not problem for me I like smaller maps.
Matchmaking is good and fast,lot of servers and game modes, you also have clans. 
Most complained are for slow server because there are only 4 servers for whole globe, 
and you can play on any server any time it drives some people crazy. 
Other companies are cheaters, but I do not find game over run by them, 
you sometimes find one or two which is normal for any game.

But dev update game often im sure these problems will be solved as player base get bigger.

Thing I would like added: 
-Weapons attachment customizations.
-Free for all (1vsALL) game mode."
20424,"This game is very well developed. The physics and the idea of the game, make it like a giant online shooting mini-game!"
20425,really good game just a free cod basically so i highly recommend this game
20426,Its just a mindless game I play when I dont have anything else to play.
20427,soild free to play. shooter needs a australia server but other then that all good.
20428,REALY fUN
20429,Very fun i play it pretty much every day but there is a weird crashing bug and i cant open the game
20430,i like the game but why did you put  girls/women with big tits bruh why

20437,"You enjoy CoD and/or CS:GO?Then this is the perfect game for you.It´s somewhere between these two games (CoD and CS:GO) Good graphics,good gameplay,no lags and good gamemodes.
The weapon balance is...well...meh...but still,there is no weapon where I would say it´s anoyying.I have played every of the gamemodes and I enjoyed 5v5 the most,it´s the same concept as in CS:GO but the rounds normaly are not that long and you only need 8 rounds to win a game and there is no ranking system,maybe they should add it?I´d like the idea.
TDM is also fun but I like gamemodes where you can do some tactics.
In some rewievs I saw that this game is Pay2Win.THAT IS NOT TRUE!!!
You can get >EVERYTHING< for free.For all you need money is the weapon/character skins but they don´t add ANY extra skills or anything!!!It´s true that you can buy stuff for real money if you don´t want to ""waste"" your time for unlucking the guns/items/knives but YOU DON´T HAVE TO!!!
Overall it´s a really funny game,I enjoyed playing it a lot,with and without friends!"
20438,Good game but have so many cheaters.

20441,Good for noobs :)   (Like me)
20442,I like this game but it needs to fix the problem that you will keep disconnect in the match.
20443,csgo2 that all
20444,"pleses add aus servers 

"
20445,they have zero balance you start and you are playing vs people who have played hundreds of hours and youv been on 15 seconds through the tutorial just a bad idea
20446,I like this GAME!!!!
20447,"Needs Oceanic servers tbh. Beyond that, it's a solid shooter. I played for a third of an hour because the lag was horrendous.

I can't recommend this to Australian or other Oceanic players."
20448,new update  destroyed my game
20449,"Generic Free to Play FPS, lets get the elephant out of the room, is the game p2w? no, but you can spend 30 bucks on the game and get access to all the weapons that takes about a month to unlock each, the reason why I don't recommend the game is the trade off between weapons and some weapons are just straight up op because of the map designs.

Also the game with match you up with potato players AGAINST people who are at your skill or higher (k/d), while that is a good deisgn overall but imo that just puts too much stress onto the people who are good. (being punished for being good at the game)"
20450,"my camera won't move no matter what, fix it."
20451,i love FPS but this game is just boring
20452,"Wow. So I saw this game on a youtubers channel and decided to try it out since it was free. It reminds of csgo mechanics mixed with call of duty gameplay and its actually extremely fun. The download didnt take long at all and the game runs and looks AMAZING for being a free to play game. Overall this game is a very rare pick to find and im glad I found it. 

Honest Rating 9.3/10"
20453,Very fun game :^)
20454,It gets boring very fast.
20455,Too weak.
20456,FUCK THIS SHIT. The fucking game has glitches that wont let you aim!
20457,"This game is similar to CoD and CSGO, without the toxicity (so far) in online competitive games, mainly due to the fact that most of the game modes do not confer you a competitive rank, besides changes to your K/D, unless you're playing clan ranked games, for which you don't get stuck with randoms trying to derank anyways.

My first impression of this game reminds me of the days playing Alliance of Valiant Arms, similar types of graphics and settings, and game modes even, except the battle mode which is something unique.

The game features skins similar to the CSGO system, though not tradable so mainly just cosmetics to show your skins off, and does not offer any material benefits such as stats unlike the capsule guns in A.V.A. It isn't hard ""grinding"" for the guns either, you win 10 games per day and you will get about 100 medals, every 2 or so hours gives you $15k which stacks 5 times per week. Daily login reward comes with $15k and on every 7th day you earn 500 Medals. On average if you play 2-3 hours a day and win 10 games, chances are you get to buy 2 new permanent guns every week ($ Shop and Medal shop respectively).

The game also offers DLC Try-before-you-buy system, you get to try new weapons out for 15 days just to get the feel of it before deciding on which weapon you want to buy with your hard grind cash.

This game is still being developed, and for a free to play game, I'd say the pay to win element isn't there (yet), and that the devs do listen to the community and make appropriate changes and steering of this game's direction. Although that's pretty much the same with every other game during its early project life. So about this paragraph here, I've yet to comment anything more than that until in a few more months time when this game matures a little more.

I do hope seeing some larger maps in the future, some of the maps are too small with about 30 odd people getting tightly packed which turns even long-range sniping into CQB sometimes."
20458,juicy
20459,"The better you play the game, the worse teammates you get. There's no depth to the matchmaking and skill progression, just a stick to beat you down.

And they have the audacity to require quickmatch wins in order to get daily grind reward.

My last 10 games of TDM are a wonderful example. The objective is the first to reach 150 kills with 8 people on each team. I had 1.65 KDR with 285 kills and 173 deaths in the last 10 games. I contributed 112 positive points towards the win objective and i won 3 of the 10 games.

If you're a masochist interested in games with broken monetization and frustrating gameplay than go ahead. The core mechanics of the game and netcode are decent but everything else is dog poo. The matchmaking won't give you competent opponents. It'll drag you down with teammates who are significantly less skilled than you and your opponents. The loot boxes are a disgrace. I spent 4 € trying to get a single weapon you can buy for silver equal to logging in 6 days in a row WITHOUT playing. I got enough BS coins (bullshit currency) to buy one THIRD of what you get for free every 7 days you log in and how much one basic weapon costs.

This game is not worth spending your money on. Just log in daily and play a tiny bit for fun. Grinding daily missions is pointless. Also try not to be too good if you don't want to be actively sabotaged by your teammates. Be satisfied with a 50% winrate because that is all you're going to get. If your KDR is 1, 1.5 or 2. The game is going to find a way to beat you down in a way that's unpleasant for everyone. The people who are added to your team as dead weights and get 4/4/20, all the other decent teammates in your team and most of all you, carrying the scoreboard but still loosing every second game because that's what ""balancing"" teams is. Adding 1 or 2 really bad players to the team with a mediocrely skilled player. 

I admit i am no pro and there are many people significantly better than me. Perhaps if you're reading this review you are too. Trust me, it won't take much to get to a point where matchmaking is actively throwing people way out of their skill level on your team to bring down your win%.

The current black squad user base really isn't that good.

Get the AK-74 and just demolish everything only to lose again and again and again and again."
20460,Good for a f2p game.
20461,"Very good game. At first I thought that the devs are lying about the no p2w, but after playing the game I can safely say that the only items that you can get for real money are cosmetic.v In my opinion, the only thing that needs to change is the smg called MPX. It is too powerful and I think, that it's magazine capacity and fire rate should be nerfed."
20462,"Its also a FPS and good game
"
20463,Карты кал
20464,Like all Neowiz games. Good and fun for playing but full off cheeters all of kind. and nobody care of them.

FINALS WORDS: This is best F2P FPS game I've played before Blacklight: Retribution went to shit and TF2 did the Meet Your Match update. The game is fun and well balanced (for the most part) but requires some work to iron out some fiddly mechanics. You should try it."
20473,"this game ...is wow. i wasnt expecting this to be such a great title. jumping into it , it feels like a freemium game at first but its not pay to play at all and then playing it felt like a perfect combo of counterstrike and call of duty! gameplay was smooth and precise like counterstrike but the customization and the class's and the aim down site with the quick respawns made it feel a little like cod so it was nice. this game is a perfect combination of the best fps franchises out there. and its free to play what were they thinking this could of made so much money but i do thank the devs for making something for the public its perfect.<3"
20474,Great game but not many people on the asian server and it kicks me off the eu server because of my ping. Please remove the feature of kicking people from eu servers like that. It may be for a good gameplay but I can't join any asian servers because of no people playing on it
20475,Very nicely made. Is fun to play. Try it as long as it's free
20476,"shit game
"
20477,"Very good for free game. Amazing graphics and gameplay. Overall wworth the 4.3 GB download. 

Only one problem:-
-If you are a new player then you get killed every second. But in thee end you will be a pro"
20478,Any one who likes shooters should play this game!
20479,"This game will kick you for high ping at the end of a hard faught ranked game where you go 20kill 7death just to get kicked at the end and not be able to join back again which makes the stupid game believe you had no part of the win when you carried your entire team, it will give you a loss not count your stats and not even give you a fucking win, just completely ruin your day and stats."
20480,Very nice game! but cheaters is ruining it.
20481,No AU server at the moment.

20487,nice
20488,its awesome shooting lil nerds
20489,i really like the game so far but i just wanted to know if you could like keep the game rank when you get a promotion in game and the next day when you get on your a private
20490,It's like CSGO mixed with COD. Very good game for a free to play.
20491,Scam dont buy any bullet's it is not worth you sped £4 and you get like 0.2 out of it dont get this game its BS
20492,GG good game.
20493,"Do you want a game that reminds you of the old Call of duty games? this is it.
It might be in early access but so far i've seen some updates and they are great.

i love the way you can run and gun.its amazing. Really quick gameplay as CoD's in combinement with CS
is Black Squad.
not much to say just that this game is reccomended and it should get way more attention that it has now
just developers keep on working on this game and of course. add more maps / modes."
20494,"For a free to play game, the microtransactions arent bad. good to hop into for some variety from csgo. quick paced. 7/11"
20495,Its a grate game but my mouse locks in one place so i cant turn around
20496,"very very bad game dont waste your time downloading it
good graphics
bad discord community 
mouse doent work sometimes
its not fun at all its trying to copy csgo
UI is the crapest thing i ever seen in a game 
you cant customize weapons 
netcode runs at 30hz i dont know why they say thats amazing
they cant make good maps 
yeah thats it dont download it"
20497,The game is amazing! I love it it's like COD for free but dude it gets boring! I got bored once and then i bought a karambit and i started to play the game for a while again but it got boring because i wanted more skins but the way to get skins in this game is FUCKING impossible unless you have like 100-200 bugs. ALL I AM SAYING IS PLEASE DEVELOPERS PLEASE MAKE IT EASIER TO GET SKINS PLEASE!!!! THE GAME IS AMAZING AND ALL BUT PLEASE!! There is no ranked and other stuff like that so the only thing left to do is get some nice skins to look at when you play TDM. Again please developers make an easier way to get skins! Thanks you! :)
20498,"Very good game!! 
Best free to play game :D"
20499,Mouse movement doesn't work.
20500,"For the peoples /

I gonna do it quick, this game is free, it's 6 gigs, it's a lot of fun, not pay to win at all, you can easily get all what the game as to offer in a short amount of time without putting any cash to it. The devs listen to the community feedback, frequently update the game, and actually they care about peoples opinions.
Download it, it's free, it's fun and if you don't like it just uninstall it.

However, there are the cons ;
The cheating scene is growing lightning fast since 1 week because you can't report cheaters and battleye (wich is the anticheat system) needs an update asap.
Laggy peoples are gods that can teleport through the matrix and take half a clip of an ak 47 in their stomach without dying.

Other than that the game is pretty okay and you must definiltely try it  :).

For the developpers /

Hello devs, i'm actually thinking that you don't really understand what players want, please add those features and everything will be fine (that's only my opinion) :
 
- Ability to report players that are obviously cheating and they don't even hide it because battleye is pointless and you have no fucking way to report them.

- Upgrade battleye, actually it's a joke, each clan match there is peoples exactly knowing your position even if you don't have done a single noise or been seen by anyone, they just use wallhacks and they don't care much of hiding it since it's a free to play and if they get banned, well let's make another account.

- Some major changes needs to happen to make this game more balanced and competitive, such as reducing the time you need to wait for shooting and aiming again after switching from weapons to weapons or knife to weapon, reload times are too long and needs to be tweaked.
Add a cooldown to crouch cause actually peoples use it as a way to cheat in combat like they use macros to spam the crouch key and make them more harder to shoot.

- If you don't want to give us Vocal chat it's fine but atleast let the dead peoples in teams, speak with other teammates that are alive to give them informations about the game, what's the point of a team based game if you can't help your mates and give them the last infos you got ?

- Restrict ping to 150, 200 is too much and 220 way to much, i'm aware some peoples don't have servers at the moments and are forced to play at high ping but the lag in this game is terrible you're seriously advantaged when you are lagging (wich is weird but i supposed it's due to some sort of lag compensation system)

- You put way too long time between shooting with the barrett 50. it's really weird and not worth playin it, blazer is 100 times more effective for the same results.

- You should stop adding weapons and focus more on the anticheat system and find a way to report cheaters because the cheat is becoming more and more a plague each day, just play for yourself 5 games of 5v5 demolition and you will see how many hackers you will encounter, they're not even hiding it.

This message was not a hate message or something supposed to be offensive, i'm just trying to help out improve the game since it has great potential but is ruined by some really weird gameplay mechanics wich from my point of view, needs to be tweaked or removed to use the real potential that this game has and make it a real fun experience.

In addition to that, that's only my point of view and your welcome to disagree with what i said i'm totally okay with that, but for me this is the way i see this game grow bigger and better and i'm just exposing my point of view and my general feedback after having played the game for a while."
20501,This is just a shity CSGO. pls dont get.
20502,"foarte fain
"
20503,"Last update 2021:
What everyone was saying for a long time, did happen, it's DEADsquad now!
I didn't played for months now and tbh i don't miss it.
I had fun on this game, made friends and did put alot of hours into it,
But bad devs and way to much cheaters did ruin the game.
Goodbye!"

20506,"Fun game, developers listen to players and nice updates. Better version of CS:GO."
20507,"I have impressed about the game because 

-The gamemode idea are amazing 
-The game is 3D than crossfire or it have amazing light and shadowing 
-Reload animation are realistic. Even the reload of the 2 light machine gun 
-Nice attachment on every weapon. Even I like the grenade launcher attachment 
-The game have fast ranks up
-The game has better anti cheat software (BattlEye) that the developer of the game still cared the game development than crossfire is full of cheaters and developer of it's game doesn't cared their game anymore 

I recommended the game cause you can find out that what type of role you are and skill development here also"
20508,love this game pls more cummies
20509,great game maybe even better than csgo
20510,great game
20511,This game is a unplayable with 0 mechanics and weird controls.It sucks balls...
20512,"Review one Early access.
Now blacksquad is a good game. Just the problem with it is the guns are a little bit not really on the realistic side let's just say. The game description said it is based on ""Realistic Combat"" But i disagree with that fact. Because the gun's let's be honest here are complete bullshit. Recoil is fvcking insane stats are all fvcked up and yeah."
20513,"why i cant play ???? it say that i have to update and restart the game ??? please help 
"
20514,"One of the greatest F2P games, as of right now it's awesome, can't wait for the full version! Keep up the good work! 
Only one thing, if you could customize your gun without spending real money, that'd be great, thanks! :D"
20515,Instantly hit with the maintence in progress when launched. 10/10 would wait again.
20516,"Great game, Fast paced and reminds me of the old shooter before they became to complicated. Seems to be no cheating yet. Hope it stays that way for a while. Download it, you wont regret it !"
20517,"wasnt my kinda fps game, but its free to play so no harm no foul"
20518,this is normal game but need more guns
20519,"I really, really like this game.  Its like a mixture of csgo and call of duty and rainbow six seige all in one.  I LOVE IT!!  I recomend this game alot!"
20520,"this game is actually pretty decent, its like counter strike but you can actually kill someone."
20521,"COOl, BUT ONLY IF YOU PLAY KNIFE ONLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
20522,"I have been very impressed by this game! Well-balanced gameplay, good weapons selection with genuine tactical trade-offs, and fun maps. The upgrade system seems fair with players being rewarded for attendance and increasing their skill level. The different game modes also keep the game interesting but the TDM is so solid that it should keep you busy for quite some time. I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys multiplayer FPS. Also can't beat F2P!"
20523,kool
20524,"Grenade Simulator!!!
also if you buy a gun with money 1 hit kill, if you use a ``free`` gun you have to hit 10 times more....

20529,yes
20530,"GREAT GAME, few hackers but they catching them, the biggets problem is the QUITERS, there needs to be a HUGE
penalty for people that quit when they start loosing because then you come in fresh and get put on a shit team
with no players and the match is 75% over. This is not the Dev's fault but needs to be dealt with."
20531,"A nice f2p fps than can run on almost any pc, nice gameplay and usually you join matches pretty fast :)"
20532,"Uninstalled. I really enjoyed the game at first, everything was nice. Then 2 things gradually poped out killing my game:
- Ping 200+, although I chose Asia the closest. 
- Maps are over-complicated with too many obstacles, levels, corners... They have thoughts, but to me it's like a cook trying to mix all of his best ingredients into 1 dish. All stars = no star. It's ok in DM where you respawn quickly, but for bombing (my fav) it's easy to get tired of watching all those walls, boxes, holes etc. every several steps, suddenly get killed out of nowhere, then watch your teammates watching walls, boxes, holes...Maps should be more concentrated on 1 or 2 team-crashing points where a team can decide to take risk and win big. 
That said, I dont want to downvote, I still recommend give it a try. The ping is kind of infrastructure problem, not the game itself, and the maps may be just personal taste.
I'll give another chance in the future, not sure when though."
20533,no just no
20534,"hey,

i really like the idea of the game and when i was able to play it it was fun!

but with the newest update, i can't even move my view around, doesn't matter if i restart or change settings.

also since the beginning of the release i can't move it in window mode nor maximize or anything like that.

i would look forward to bugfixes of that since now it's basically not playable."
20535,it a mosawdsd
20536,"Do you love games that have screenshots that looks nothing like the game itself? do you love CounterStrike? do you love Call of Duty? well this is the game for you, it takes everything that was bad and annoying in Call of Duty and puts it in a brand new FPS that plays like a game from 13 years ago.
Experience the thrill of hearing the sound of your character shouting in your ear every time you reload, just to remind you what you are doing.

Think back to the days of your youth when you couldn't wait to go home and play that good old fps games where aiming down sight was the same as hipfire all combined with the common nerdrage of people calling you a noob because your team lost.

On the upside though, it's free and will probably kill some time if you're really bored"
20537,It's free
20538,"yo pretty good point and click adventure, would rate."
20539,Good game.Good Graphics
20540,i think the game is awsome but is too cs:go realated i think the game has a lot of potential add more game modes to gcreate some diversity

20542,450 ping minimum on every server.... European 450ping Asai 450ping....... Nuff said

would recommend to have a go"
20544,Jeu toujours pas opti après 1 siècle... crash et perte d'fps juste dans le menu ! woah good job
20545,"this game is the single most barebone shooter i have ever played.
everything is really basic, guns have basicly no recoill. zooming in with a sniper or using ironsight is instant (wich i dont mind)
but my biggest problem with this and all shooters is the simple fact that the devs feel like they need to clutter the screen with useless notifications when you make a kill. stop that bullshit. trust your playerbase to have knowledge and know when they killed someone. 

but, if you dont have any money to spare and you want a solid shooter that doesnt do anything original.
then this game is good enough i guess. even tho i didnt like it that much. its a simple game and i could see why people would like it
its not bad but its not good either"
20546,"GAQY,
"
20547,This is a great MMOFPS game. Spent the whole night playing it. Love it.
20548,i love this game but i cant recommend it to people in NA because they dont give a S H I T about NA no ping limits for NA or anything wtf
20549,i was to paid to right this
20550,"Very rarely does a game leave a poor impression so quickly as this one. The volume was ridiculously loud as default and the controls are clunky. This would not be a flaw save for the simple fact that there is no way to do anything about the deafening noise or general cludgbe until you have completed a tutorial that only serves to demonstrate just how infuriating the volume and controls were. After enduring the forced tutorial I was introduced to the first elements of the in game shop, which looks to be yet another pay to win model disaster. After the deafening hell that was the tutorial I said no more and uninstalled. 

Take that for what you will."
20551,"One match in, game is meh, spawn camped to hell and back, deleted"

20554,its good
20555,"A faster and more casual Call of Duty. Has some nice weapon and player models, decent performance, and an accessible FtP model, but plagued by lag and what I can only describe as Dancing Idiot Syndrome. Thanks to the lack of spread while changing direction, it's a viable tactic to just spam the A and D keys like you're trying to imitate the latest dance video. No fun, especially when coupled with the massive disconnect that high ping players bring. You will find a lot of them, because apparently the Asian players get better pings to the NA servers than to the Asian servers.

Time to kill is absurdly low, but also very inconsistent. Weapon balance is questionable, with some being outright useless or redundant in the face of other guns. Map design is pretty much only narrow corridors with one or two angles in on them, barely any open space to speak of. Long sight lines are quite rare. Some elements of the maps are also notably unbalanced toward one team or the other.

Cannot recommend until there are more servers and ping limits, as well as weapon balance passes, maybe some movement nerfs. As it is, it's more frustrating than fun."
20556,For the type of game it is its preety good and it is doing its job perfectly.
20557,"This game was good but the devs of this game are to busy doing things that dont really matter right now.They added a Asia server which was supposed to help but it didnt, the american servers are flooded with people from mexico and asia with 200+ ping which makes them impossible to kill.On top of that there is no form of skill matching be prepared to get put with people who are 20 ranks hire than you. They dont even match solo players with solo players they will put 8 solo players up against a full clan of max rank it rediculouse i just unistalled the game because i got put with 8 guys from asia withh 200+ ping and all with a 3.0 K/D or higher its rediculous.So untill the devs decide to region lock teh game so u can go on other servers or at least put a pink limit of 150 so you dont have laggy people flooding the servers and add some sort of skill matching like every other multyplayer game has and stop addind stuff like 3 sensitivity settins for each class i will not suggest this game to anyone."
20558,muito foda
20559,Ok gameplay but there's like 5 hackers every game
20560,Literally 10 hackers every game lol
20561,"Uninteresting generic gameplay, limited weapon selection, boring maps with poorly designed objective and spawn locations. It doesn't do much to set it self aside as something worth more than a few hours but it's not a bad game."
20562,"“TACTICAL RELOAD TACT RELOAD EUGHHH EUHHHHGGG UGGHHHH !!!!”
*Input same voice lines in and out*

Jokes aside, I picked this game up to try it for a casual, primary TDM based game, and for what it stands for being non-pay to win game that is also free to play, the only thing it has going for it, is that concept and decent gameplay. 
Gameplay is quite reminiscent to a combination of Call of Duty and Counter Strike, and quite nostalgic to Combat Arms style gameplay. The EXP and Money earned per game is quite miniscule, so prepare to grind to gain new weapons to use on your loadout. Three loadouts are given to customize, and the game starts you with starter weapons that are subpar to other guns in the game. 

Once you start to get used to the aim and mechanics of the game, is where the game’s ideation starts come into play, being a pure skill reliant gameplay, where no factors of paid weaponry can dictate who wins a gunfight. Other reviews will also touch base on the region lock, and playing in NA servers, be prepared to face people from other regions with 100+ ping. 

From the start of the game, you can see a lot of obnoxious things to nitpick, which a few comes to mind is that during the tutorial, they force you to use default sensitivity and settings, which comes with deafening audio of headshots and the same death cry used repeatedly, which results in annoyance (yet seemingly funny) experience as a player of many titles of the FPS genre. Guns have a missing a single shot in their magazine, hit reg could sometimes be buggy, and other times it becomes a clusterfuck of nades and dead bodies, wreathing in agonizing pain of the same voice line. Sometimes I feel this game takes itself a bit too serious, or is clearly making fun of certain themes of other iconic FPS games.

But giving the benefit of the doubt, it is still in Early Access, so a lot of things can be changed to develop this game into a rather enjoyable game that both sides of FPS gamers, serious or casual, can both enjoy. Until then however, I will be enjoying this game on an ironic standpoint, playing this game only when bored or wanting to have a giggle.

F2P but not P2W"
20567,"Ive played this game 10 hours around now. I dont review games really but this game really made me want to give something because this games free, got no pay to win aspect on it, the only thing u can spend money on is skins. It feels smoth and even a low end computer can run it ive not got the best of computers but i play this with 80 fps on lowest specs. Also it feels like csgo/Call of duty and it runs amazingly. 

Things id like to see is something headshots dont regester when you headshot them
Id also like to see ranked mode for people who dont like clans or that stuff

I 100% think you should get this game it really is worth it"
20568,Is good when you are bored
20569,good graphics
20570,"I am editing this as of 11/28/17 to give my actual review of the game. As you can see I have plenty of hours in game and I would have to say it's worth it. It's actually free to play and the free DLC's allow you to try out every weapon in game for 30 days to let you get the feel for which you like. Along with this there is also the Welcome Fortune Box which is free and will give you either a gun with a skin or a character which is pretty cool. The gameplay is solid and is generally tons of fun. You rarely if ever deal with hackers 1 out of 50 games usually at least. Grinding is simple and you improve quickly as you play.  Lvling is fun and you will probably gain a lvl on a rank every two or three days or a few times a day at the beginning. It's just in general a good game and there are very few things I can think of as cons like the fact you can NOT just shoot a rifle and  have it hit in the crosshairs. You actually have to aim. For any of you who are planning on joining the ak47 is powerful but you can not spray. It's just all over the place. You have to tap fire or aim down your sights. The m4 is probably the best assault rifle for stability and aim as you can just spray and it is really accurate. If you have a crappy computer just turn down the graphics quality.  I hope this review helps you all out.





















DEV PLEASE READ I REALLY NEED HELP
I really like the game but I've only been playing for 5 days and there's already a issue. Everyone keeps moving in the same direction and the game says I'm disconnected from server and shuts down the whole game. the error code is all zeroes. 

I am editing this 10/22/17 to notify you of another error. When you launch the game it gets buggy and when you click play it will do the intro of it saying Black Squad on screen but then it will give one of two errors. Under Maintence [3] [7] or Invalid Approach [5] [8]. I've reset my steam, verified file integrity, switched internet connections, restarted my computer,etc. Still hasn't worked."
20571,the game just dosnt want to run on my potato pc evan though its mostly capable of running black squad at very low settings for any computer.the game opens but says that there are security problems.thats the only thing thats bad about black squad u cant play.if u can fix this that would be helpful because i heard that black squad is a great free 2 play game. but i wont recommend playing it until the game is properly fixed.
20572,Literally just a free to play imitation of cs:go
20573,"maybe remove the reload thing at the beginning of the round. adding only 1 bullet. i think this game will be better if weapons are not purchasable. hoping to see a competitive mode soon, also fix the UI, just make it simplier.
just like csgo, make all the guns available in a competitive  at the beginning of the round. and the major thing i noticed in this game was the slow bullet hit, just make it fire like a real gun. im looking forward to this game that it will be better soon. it was the next gen Fps game that can beat the old mechanics and visuals of csgo. Just dont let the cheaters/hackers ruin the fun for us."

20580,NO WORKING TO OPEN !
20581,Almost like  Call Of Duty if ya cant afford lol
20582,.
20583,"this is once of the best FPS games i have ever played.
10/10, deveopers."
20584,Cheatcrap.
20585,"fast paced CS without the teamplay, or CoD without the gay shit. My perfect game. git gud."
20586,Completely F2P you can spend all the money you want. It WILL NOT make you good.
20587,TAC RELOAD
20588,The free to play model is not that bad and you can get good weapons fast. They even give you 3 DLC full of weapons and attachments. But BUT the maps are soooooooo boring and short. The spam of granades and artillery is so shit and annoying. This in my opinion is the biggest flaw in the game right now. The game runs very good i have a shity laptop and i can run it at 60 70 fps so yea its eazy to pick up.
20589,"Servers are too bad, ttk is way too quick for it's own good, and the bad ping causes kills to be extremely random. Sometimes you end up having to spray half your clip after a couple shots to the head and without having been hit in the previous engagement, the guy will one shot body shot you around the corner. Random and orderless"
20590,10/10 would TAC RELOAD again
20591,"Game is Good... Mechanics are OK.. Since I was a hige fan of Ghost Recon Phantoms, I dont find this game much interesting because the mechanics in GRP was much more intense.. This game has the capability to become a huge hit.
I would love to see a few changes:
1. a key to switch from first person to third person and vice versa.
2. cover mechanics in the game is missing and i would love to see it. Cover mechanics and cover shooting would be love for this game..
Hope the devs add these two things in the game.."
20592,NICE GAME
20593,"The maps are crap, they did the thing call of duty did mw3 and on where you cannot play patient and wait for someone to come around the corner, you have to go around yourself so 90% of gunfights are hipfire spraying in the same room. It's also like u have to head shot or you will not win any gunfight which is kinda annoying tbh. I'd say try it and see for yourself considering it's free"
20594,"I like it alot,its very balance and its not low quality,its not p2w its just aswome for a f2p game its amazing
"
20595,"Recommended.
It is a F2P shooter game with amazing netcode, great servers (AWS) and tight gunplay.
There are a few caveats though, but hey, it's Early Acccess.

+ It's not pay-to-win.
+ The devs improve the game. BattlEye killed the game for me weeks ago because I had Dropbox running. Now that's fixed.
+ The gun models look amazing.
+ The game engine scales down and up on a great range. That is superb, and more games should do this. You can play with potato graphics and with amazing ones.
+ Tight gunplay.
- You have to click ""set default"" in control options, else the mouse won't work. Kinda an issue as this may make people mad.
- Maps need a lot of rework. They are very small.
- Bit of an Eastern bang to it. Like the blood splatters are HUGE, bigger than in CS1.0, which is just silly.
- No blood (at least on my PC), and decals. Can make seeing hits and whatnot quite hard.
- No brass. Why? I like hearing and seeing my bullets and magazine drop.
- The sounds are AWFUL. They serve their purpose but please, do not be Valve. I mean the current CS:GO sounds are ""Okay-ish"" but far from good. And everything in CS:Source and CS:GO until the rework recently was bloody awful. So it's now on that level. Check Battlefield, check Insurgency, do nice sounds. We love gun sounds and they can be heard just as well.
- Menu system could use a rework. I mean it works, it's not that confusing, but it's also a bit basic."

20597,fucking boring
20598,"Shitty game i don't know why should do i play this game anymore,is playing with my nerves and if i get triggered it will be not good so...DISLIKE"
20599,"Overall its good, just need to fix the SEA server, the ping is just like in other servers."
20600,An actual good game!
20601,its like free to play of csgo really good job and one more thing please remove timed wepons i hate timed wepon and i bought random box and i got bs coins what do i do with that and please remove timed weopons thanks for this awsome game and good job black squad team and please add prement granade and smoke and flash
20602,"Nice free 2 play game, everything except skins can be earned.

Worth a shot.
"
20603,"shit game.
dont put money in it
btw i didnt"
20604,Garbage.
20605,"My new Favorite Game! (Besides Fallout)
"
20606,"Very nice game. Great to play and it is for free !!! Who looks for free a ego shooter like counter strike or something like that, this gameis the right for him.

Wish to the producers: Could you add a new gamemode called weapon game or something like that, so the player must get kills and therefore he gain new weapons to kill again and so and so on... woul be very very nice :)"
20607,"Poor ping, unbalanced maps and gameplay"
20608,I don't know what i was expecting when i installed this i guess the intro video had me thinking this would be a fun call of duty clone. What was i thinking of course this is just another poorly made free to play shooter with ping so high you would think that the servers were hosted at someone house. Thats a 0/10 for me would not even recommend even installing this.
20609,"for a f2p shooter game it's really good especially when you are playing with a friend

it's true that there are some cons but people seem to forget that the game is at it's early access stage

"
20610,"Played this game quite a bit, its a very generic fps. Fast paced and good enough to kill some time and ofcorse free. But like virtually all fps on steam, there are no asian servers. 200 - 300 for a ping remined me of the days playing CS on a modem. Great idea to use ping locking except for the other 2/3 of the worlds population. Really smart"
20611,"ANIME PLAYER MODELS IN A SHOOTER, CAN WE HAVE THE SPONGE BOB MODEL MAYBE NOW?"
20612,where am i?
20613,Meh.
20614,"I read some of the lower played hours and the people are wrong. The game is super fun and addicting. It is a mix of CoD 2 and CS:GO. But don't go into this game expecting 100% counter-strike because it is not that. The meta right now is AK 47 and deagle. Both of these guns you can unlock for free. The maps are really good, I enjoy em. I have over 1k hours on CSGO, and been playing counter-strike for years now, going back to 1.5. This game feels like maybe Call of duty pro mod. You get rewards as you log into the game everyday, and on the 7th? day you get a bunch of medals, which you can buy weapons for. The weapons you can buy are not a 14 day trial, you will have them forever. It does not take long to grind the weapons either. They have matchmaking and it works well. I'm a huge CS:GO fan, and you can easily matchmake for a 5v5 bomb & defuse match.

They do have random box skins, and they are hard to get just like in CSGO. The only thing is that you can't trade them with other people.

I have seen some reviews about hitboxes being bad, but there is a mode where you can test them yourself, and to me, they seem fine. Not sure how they are when the person is moving though. I have been playing a bit so far, and it seems solid to me (when someone is moving). This is a korea shooter / call of duty ISH type of game, so you can get some random running head shots.

I said earlier how I do like the maps. The maps usually have a 3 lane, sometimes they do split off, which is nice. You got your standard path to A and B with a mid for sniping.

They do have a clan system, which can be leveled up and you will get a cool emblem.

If you like CS:GO, and find some korean shooters fun to play, I would recommend this one. I been enjoying it a lot. It has that ""one more match"" feeling like CS:GO, and maybe that's why I keep playing it. Plus, it would be nice to get some of the sick looking knife skins :) .

Lastly, the devs do check the discord and steam forums as well. They always do streams on twitch and talk about the things they see the community chatting. They are close to the communication like Blizzard does with their games. They are VERY open with answering all kinds of questions as well."
20615,اه
20616,A good game for free
20617,"Not very exciting, but would be playable with a half decent UI and Guns that dont dissapear after a set time."
20618,Fix you broken ass game with the hitboxes. Shits too unfair
20619,"terrible, the games are completely one sided right at the beginning. whichever team has the better weapons is going to dominate the game the whole time which makes it not fun whatoever."
20620,"Said by someone who has thousands upon thousands of hours in shooters (this is not my only steam account), I would say that this is the worst game in my steam library. Just because it's free doesn't mean it's good, or even mediocre. It's barely passable. Sure, it's in early access, but I have no faith it's going to get much better. In an age of great FPS games, this is too little, too late.

The menu is horrible, the visuals are underwhelming, the sound design is fairly bad. The gunplay is bad. The maps are extremely tiny, like 20 seconds to run across it, but the bullets still hang in midair for a moment before hitting the target. I get the idea of having projectile bullets instead of hitscan, but there's no reason to have to predict where the enemy is moving when they're less than 20 feet away. Oh, except for the sniper rifles that oneshot you across the map.

This game doesn't know what it wants to be, and it's worse than all the things it's copying."
20621,Pretty good for a FTP. Reminds me of NEXON's Combat Arms
20622,yes
20623,"A fun free FPS that is devoid of any P2W that I can tell. It's got balanced weapons, I haven't paid anything yet, and when I'm in a game I feel as though I'm on the same level as everyone else. 

As for the gameplay, it feels like a mix between COD and CS. All guns have silencers and lasers that you can enable/disable whenever you feel like it. 

The graphics are nothing to write home to the lady friend about, but they aren't at all terrible or distracting. 

All in all I support this game, it's fun and free, it deserves some props."
20624,S.S.D.G.
20625,"its pc version of COD. same playstyle, no recoil really. menus are hard to navogate, but fun with friends i guess. its free come on. ALSO IS NOT PAY TO WIN"
20626,"I highly reccomend this game. It is extremely competitive and has a very large arsenal and the gameplay is dynamic with stunning graphics. Its kind of like a mixed breed, most of the concepts from CSGO and then COD mixed in there. The maps however are extremely unbalanced, so is the damage from hit points."
20627,lol this game needs better physics and hit registry but other than that when it does work right its really fun so i recommend it too people that dont get angry quick but very fun please up date the engine devs would make the game so much more fun if the hit box is fixed
20628,"Good game, it has one flaw (hackers) but at the end of the day - it's free.

With that said, every free game I have ever played (and the majority of paid for games, for that matter) has hackers, so it's a bit of a null point.

Hackers will always find a way around whatever anti-cheat is implemented into a game and even if they were to get banned - it's not hard to create a new account and start again, so it would be pointless to give this game a negative rating, solely on the handful of children that can't play the game properly."
20629,shit
20630,Fun Game! Kinda like CSGO but a bit better graphics... Haven't ran into any problems yet. Keep up the good work.
20631,Stupid af. Will connect me to their Virginia server even though there's an Oregon one. My ping ends up being in 150 instead of 50.
20632,"Its a good online shooting game. Unfortunately like all online shooters, they are very repetetive (ie. boring) and eventually you just want to play something else instead."
20633,good
20634,Big big no no feels badz
20635,"This game is complete trash. 
AntiCheat System - TRASH
Community - TRASH
Gameplay - TRASH
Everything is copy-paste from other games.
I suggest you not to invest any money or hard work to this game because game has A LOT of bugs and you can just lose access to the game without a way to fix it. Please don't invest anything in this game because you will lose it."
20636,Better spend 7 euros on csgo.
20637,"Black Squad is one of the better Free-To-Play shooters out there.

It's like a Call of Duty/Counter-Strike hybrid."
20638,"Definitely Recommend. Just like overwatch+csgo.
Easy to play , learn (if you've played FPS before)
Nice Gamemode (not boring at all)

Menu needs redesign. Make it more simple then this game is gold

(+Please, not pay2win or pay4skins dev :D )"
20639,nice game .. love it
20640,"Full of cheaters that dont get banned
No balance/gameplay updates
North American Servers are dead... game is only played in Asia, South America and Europe

No new content

20643,dadadadadada
20644,amazing
20645,"Im changing my review since I realised this game is all about AK47. You can make 1 shot from any distance, its so stupid. You dont stand a chance if you dont use AK 47."
20646,"nice 
"
20647,Very good gave me aids and cancer
20648,"Ok so I have been playing this game with hardly any major problems so far. Until today that is.... I started up the game today and everything was running as it should. But then when it came to playig I had no control with looking around... When I whent to check on the mouse settings everything looked fine. But just in case I did a minor tweek with the sencitivity, and just like magic it worked? No not really.... I WAS able to look around until I jumped or tried to switch weapons. I tried getting it to work but no luck so far. And it's not like my computer isn't able to handle the game, I have been playing it. It's only until they did A maintnence update that this happend. I would like to see this game work out I really would. But for the fact that there system is shut down all the time to have work done, and for it not to work just gives me a reason to give this a thumbs down.... Sorry guys but if you could actually fix this issue that would be great. Saddly I'm sorry but it's a no go on a good game."
20649,"YET again another horrible game. Looks great but the idea behind it is absolute horrid.  FIRST and foremost NO real world scenario would you have a sniper looking down his scope going down hallways and around corners to kill someone THAT isn't how sniping works.  2ndly, I just played my first game and at 3 different times I hit a player with 5 shots and I get killed with 1 shot GIVE me a break. This is call of duty but a few levels below it.  There is no boards for sniping PERIOD not real sniping. Lastly, if there is an objective mode MAKE it an objective mode the rest of the game isn't based in reality so why in a demolition based game mode does it just simply feel like a TEAM DEATHMATCH once a team dies the other wins so it absolutely is a TDM even though it says DEMOLITION.  These war games like this one and countless other need to bring in REALISM not a dreamworld based idea.  Like I said for someone to literally take 5 shots and NOT die or be hindered from killing someone else but just go about your marry way as nothing even happened is absolutely insane and a stupid idea all around.  Lastly, other than battlefield that is out currently there is NO real sniping game out there at all.. NO SNIPER in any real world scenario is walking down a hallway looking down his scope for a kill or running around a board for that matter doing that LOOKING for a kill in any real scenario.  I wish these developers would make a quality game instead of one the kiddos enjoy to play because it is simply free. I played the game once and that is literally all it took to realize how bad it was actually made and the concepts behind it make no sense.. HORRIBLE GAME DON'T WASTE your time."
20650,Fuck you guys for defaulting the game to max volume
20651,Wunderbar!!
20652,"If youre looking for a multiplayer game, like Call of Duty and you also like Battlefield, youre most likely going to love this game. Its pretty fun and given thats its a free to play game, i can see myself playing this for a long time."
20653,Not very fun!
20654,They ruined this title stay far away. I honestly don't know what the hell they were thinking. But adding anime titties to a dam game and ruining the game-play entirely does not help it whatsoever. Absolute trash now.
20655,"It's kinda like Crossfire & Counterstrike with ADS and high graphics, and the rubber bullets is real. god damn it.

and it does not base on the cartridge it uses aswell, same as Crossfire and such, it mostly base the gun's damage by the weapon type and how it looks instead.

PKP Pecheneg 7.62×54mm vs R93  ‎7.62×51mm NATO

PKP Pecheneg (Type: Light Machine Gun)
I have to shoot the person who has an R93 6-11 times before I kill him. (rubber bullets)

Blaser R93 (Type: Sniper Rifle)
He just have to shoot me anywhere just once to kill me. (instakill)"
20656,"You're all Liars! I trusted you and downloaded this. This is EXACTLY like wolf team. Plays the same. Works the same. Will end the same. This is NOT poor mans counter-strike / CoD. 
Don't. Just Don't. Fun for an hour."
20657,"DO NOT LET THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS FOOL YOU

This is one of the best F2P Games out there. I don't understand why people are negative about the game, ITS FREE! What do you want?!
It is a fast paced game and plays like Counterstrike and COD, what more do you want.

Its worth the download just to try it out, what do you have to lose"
20658,so need controller support. i really like the look of this game......
20659,needs quite a bit of work.
20660,It's CS:GO for poor people. This game is free and I still want a refund.
20661,"When I got this game i was instantly pushed into a widely multiplayer game but on my first game my team got spawn killed over and over by the opposition and for the first game i felt very threatened to go into my next. enough chit chat, the game is basically a poor mans Call of Duty and Csgo mixed together. So its a good game but still needs to be worked on.
6/10"
20662,Nice game
20663,"Basically a free version of csgo except the maps are much smaller, it harder to kill someone, the weapons do less damage, and there are more try hards and barely any hackers. i've never seen anyone blatanly hacking and the community is way better than csgo. sometimes you get an ""ez"" or ""you're trash but so far no toxic players 7.5/10 Would reccommend for someone to play if they dont have 15 dollars for csgo or if they are bored , or if they are tired of hackers and toxic plebs on csgo."

I was super excited for this game but kind of a let down that i cant even look around except the direction im facing when i start.

20669,"As CS:GO wasn't fun for me anymore and no game was bringing me attention, I found this little gem which is Black Squad.

In short, Black Squad is a F2P FPS with no pay-to-win. It can provide fun to all players, from casual to competitive and hardcore players.

Updates are somewhat frequently. The devs are always trying to balance things, add new content and make the game more enjoyable.

I recommend you to try it out, even for a little bit. Not all people like it, but if you do, you'll definitely love it."

It's a good F2P game,worth checking out!"
20682,"An arcade shooter game that has disappointing graphics, uninteresting shooter mechanic and outdated user interface."
20683,"Please read carefully.

This game is extremely early access! 

First point, I have tried to get through the in game tutorial 7 times since I downloaded this ""thing"" (I can't see calling it a game at this stage). First 4 times I make it to the jump ""tutorial"" section and this thing crashes saying I don't have enough internet connection, etc. Reboot and reload, make it the crouch section and nothing works. I mean nothing! I can move, and jump, no mouse support, no other key support. I had to manual reboot to get out of this turdfest!
I almost wrote this review at that point, but cooler head prevailed and I waited. I load up next time, several days later. The game crashed, with the standard crash report, but kept playing the music and Steam even showed me as in game. Another reboot to escape this thing again.
So, I was done. Completely done. CS:GO, I shall return to. For some reason I decided to boot this shit show up one more time. Holy fuck, everything worked (or so I thought).
I had a hell of a time navigating the menu, the match making is absolute shit. Others have stated that the entire playing community camps (while this is horribly accurate) it gets worse. I remember the glory days of playing COD online (about MW2 era) when good players existed and the game was infurating yet enjoyable. However, this things entire concept is to try to make a COD game, where you constantly pay the devs to not be prison shower raped, yet it keeps happening. I had absolutely no intent of giving these guys money, unless I really felt the game was justifiable of the extravagence. IT IS MOST CERTAINLY NOT!!!! 
After being ass raped for the 20th some odd time, I said fuck it and left the play sphere, to try to complete the tutorial hoping for some nugget of knowledge about counter rape. Guess what I found, no mouse support in tutorial. I have mouse function through lobby, actual game play, menus, etc. Nothing in the tutorial! Well, that was the straw that broke the camels back for me. 
Avoid this train wreck of a COD clone! If you're wanting an online shooter, go play CS:GO, at least everything works, and the game is fun!"
20684,Its a good game!

20691,"Black Squad Early Impressions:

Here's a short little review that I decided to post up based on my early impressions on the game during its Early Access.

The game has a lot going for it that seperates it from other free FPS and for the matter, current paid FPS games like CS:GO. It leans towards the arcadey style shooter akin to the CoD series but brings good mechanics over from games such as Alliance of Valiant Arms and Counter Strike (such as strong, predictable gun recoil and control, attachable silences mid-game, lack of sprint, etc.) 
It's a solid FPS experience that takes from good gunplay mechanics from the Counter Strike series but pairs it with good aim-down-sights action from CoD and blends it really well. Each and every weapon has its own unique recoil pattern and bring their own pros and cons to the table.
The game may seem to lack 'customization' options to weapons that seems to be trending on new FPS releases but in my opinion, this helps keep the game balanced as nearly every weapon has the same capabilities from fresh out the store (the guns already are decked out in 'tacticool' mods) and everyone is on the same playing field. 
The game also does extremely well with its current Free to Play model which, let me stress, is 100% free to play and 0% pay to win. The only microtransactions that you can pay for are RNG boxes that contain skins of guns that you can otherwise unlock through either in game credits or this other currency called 'medals' which you get from doing daily quests. I only started playing today and I'm almost nearly on my way on getting a perm weapon from the medal store (1600 medals but I need 2500 medals for the purchase).
Oh, and all the guns in the in game store are for permanent purchase. No timed frills except for nades and event items. 
On the server side of things, there's currently only 4 servers up for North and South America, Europe and Asia which is fine even though I play from Oceania. My ping is a playable 260 even in North America and I don't experience that bad of lag except for the 'no-regs' when I go up against a Sniper player who is quick enough to trade blows with me. 
The one thing that I must take away from this game is that... the map designs are some of the worst I've ever encountered. Choke points on literally every map, on nearly every corner which strangles teams because there is no dynamic spawn system and follows more tradition T base, CT base style. 
Despite this, the overall game is pretty damn good and hits the market hard as a strong F2P FPS contender.

Review Summary:

*Combat & Balance: 8.5/10 (+Extremely good gunplay with good weapon variety and damage models, -nades can be spammy at times)
*Customization: 7/10 (+Good system customizations, +Different characters, +a strong assortment of modern weaponry, -limited weapon customizations, -limited in depth customizations)
*Payment Model: 9/10 (+True free to play with no pay to win aspects, +Very easy to get cash by normally playing, +Methods of farming in game cash too, +Daily system is not intrusive, -Minor negative for those who don't like rng boxes)
*Servers: 7/10 (+Competent servers that work, -'Only' 4 regions)
*Map Design: 4/10 (+Lots of routes to take on maps, -Not competitively designed, -Terrible chokepoints, -Especially bad map design when you take into account nearly every gun comes pre-attached with a grenade launcher)

Overall Score: 7/10 - Black Squad is a solid F2P FPS to pick up if you're in the mood for a fast paced, arcadey, boots on ground FPS with a true free to play model that boasts a good assortment of guns coupled with extremely good gunplay."
20692,it started  to wwork but there is  to much maintance but i  still play it because it is   enjoyable and i am a great sniper.
20693,Amazing! Better than COD for sure!
20694,Like Cs

20699,The pistols are WAYYYYYYYYYYYYY too fucking op
20700,"Batter than COD

10/10"
20701,"I just played for a bit.

I would say ""the feel"" is better than when I first play CS:GO

I have high hope that this game will be a success."
20702,"Some learning curve. Shooting mechanics and feel is not as super polished as other games but it's 90% there. Game modes are crazy fun and there're plenty of players. I love that there are plenty of weapons to choose from but there's a confusing amount of various currencies to use. Gold, and Medals and Bullets... Still, with the variety of weapons (each showing different stats) it feels like it's worth playing. And there's light additions like turrets and air strikes that just makes the game more fun and crazy yet still rewarding to be tactical."
20703,Shit Game
20704,"It's a pretty fun game especially with the new updates and stuff. Its not pay to win unlike alot free fps shooters on steam which is good. The only con right now is the inconsistent hitboxes and players playing on servers they shouldnt be on to gain advantage. Even though they gave asian players their own server, they still go on other servers and have like 200-300 ping and one tapping guys. Even tho i only have 57 hrs. on this game, ranking up to second lieutenant wasnt that hard, except for the inconsistent hitboxes. Sometimes I hit players on the head once or twice, while also hitting them on the chest and they wont die even tho you see blood coming out from them and then they go right ahead and kill you which is a little bit frustrating. Although it doesnt happen frequently, I hope they take a look at it and fix it. Overall, I would recommend this game to people since it's not really competetive, and it has fun game modes that you can play with your friends."
20705,"This game is not as good as other ftp shooters out there. It has poor translations and awkward wording all over the confusing menues. 
The weapons do not feel balanced or consistent. There were multiple times I would not kill an enemy with a headshot from a sniper but a body shot would 1 shot an enemy. 
The controlls felt sloppy and the player felt more sluggish then they should. 
Game was not a satisfying experience
4/10
"
20706,"This game have litteraly no pay to win so play the game and the only money you pay is for skins 
i love this game so mutch"

It's real fun and engaging. Server quality and hit reg are awesome.

Basic customization and progression.

No P2W content.

Decent looking.

Loved it."
20709,"The game itself plays well, and although some people seem to take me out in a two shots while it took me five or six I chalked it up to they grinded more. I was able to stand toe to toe in the few matches I played. That is the crux of my problem the few matches I played kicked me for high ping. I wasnt able to finish one match because the game would constantly keep kicking me. Overall It's a good game but there isn't a server for West coast players to connect to so until then I can't recomend the game."
20710,boring generic shooter .
20711,"I reloaded by tactical pistol yelling ""TAKKRREEELOOAD"", then strapped my tactical pistol onto my tactical vest next to my tactical grenades. I then got out my tactical rifle and turned on the tactical light and loaded the tactical grenade launcher, then attached my tactical supressor. I then went forth into battle tactically but was overwhelmed by the tactical hacking tactics of the koreans and tactical chat trolling.

My Experience:

Overall the game feels a bit dated and slow paced, having played many diffrent kinds of shooters over the years I found this one to be hard to get into. I tried about four guns before figuring out what worked best. Accuraccy is your friend, it is pretty much whoever sees the other fist wins (as long as they are accurate or use the MK46).

For me personally I did poorly untill I turned the sensitivity up to max on everything, shrunk the crosshairs and disabled their movement. Then I could actually use guns other than close range SMGs and the MK46. Since I made the control changes I manage an adverage KAD of 32/8/7 after a week of playing.

From what I hear this game plays like CS:GO, I have only played 10 minutes of that so I couldn't tell you if that is true.
I'm used to playing shooters where you are a bit more of a super soldier but they are well balanced such as Planetside 2, Doom and Halo. Coming from those you might stuggle adapting to this pace.

Other notes:

You start off with enough gold (IGC) to purchase pretty much any of the weapons in the game, just know that your play style may call for diffrent types of guns than you would go for in other games.

The maps are really well done, balanced sightlines and spawning, however I have only seen 5 across all the gamemodes I have played. However as of the time of writing the game is still in early access and I'm sure more will be added.

I have yet to see a positive thing in chat, all to often I see kid, noob, fag and other online ""insults"" thrown around, NOBODY likes this and people in chat just resond to it with more of it. How people forget that there is another living breathing human on the other side of the screen is beyond me. So if you see it, don't get trolled. (also I don't think there is voice chat)

For a free game and a smaller download size, it is worth a try just know that it may take some getting used to. I have played off and on for a week and have had some fun.

8/10 Im not a bot.

Hard to argue against that."
20720,"Confusing menus, disadvantaged beginners, generic gameplay, no weapon spray whatsoever, infinite range, lack of communication, casual normie players, watered down CS:GO mechanics, easy gunplay, and that goddamn one-hit sniper that you [b]don't have to pay for on a game-by-game/round-by-round basis[/b] and [b]cannot be kept between rounds if picked up[/b] are the main reasons why this game is absolute balls.

P.S. That sniper really is BS. If someone has it and you don't you might as well quit because you can't get it off of them."
20721,the best of all best copy ninja csgo
20722,good game
20723,ok but laggy and I have a good pc
20724,"Just overall terrible and bland, makes the same mistakes as other modern fps, f2p games."
20725,"As many others have said, Black Squad combines the objective-based gameplay and map design of Counter-Strike, along with a few other things, such as making noise, and combines it with the gunplay of Call of Duty.

Whereas other F2P shooters have massive balance issues and generally require tons of time to unlock new weapons, it's more or less the opposite here. They start you off with enough to buy 1-2 guns right off, and you can earn enough of the game's currencies to buy more in a few hours of play, though the starter guns are still solid options.

The game uses Battleye, which, while not a perfect anti-cheat, does a pretty good job. I haven't seen a single cheater since I started.

Overall? 7.5/10. Room for improvement, but it could be a whole lot worse. It's great for a free game, and really breaks the mold that F2P shooters on steam have created over the years. Give it a try, and if you don't like it, no money lost."

20727,ADD FUCKING HEALTH REGENERATION
20728,This is the best free to play FPS I've seen in years! I highly recommend this game to poeple who can't afford Call Of Duty or Modern Warfare. I also enjoy the fast pace atmosphere giving players with skillful aiming an edge.
20729,"OP wepons and armor, spawn killing, crappy controls, bad ui and menus... nope"
20730,Imagine if CoD and CSGO had a retarded baby that was somehow kind of lovable.  It's be Black Squad.
20731,"8.5/10
very good game. fast paced, tons of different game modes, interesting weapons. combat is fairly routine and easy to grasp. maps are well designed, if sometimes a bit one sided.

Servers are often under maintenance which is a masive pain."
20732,"Finally, a good free to play shooter."
20733,Fun and fast pace game...
20734,"Terrible game. Zero recoil, poor animations, the sounds are just funny. Some keys cannot be rebinded, or they even just binded natively to something truly useless (i happened to have the run key binded to the mouse scroll wheel ckick! ) The maps have a nice settings, but they would look poor even by 2007 standards, very little detail (the interiors are literally empty). There's also a bot mode that's useless imho."
20735,"""Absolutely no Pay-to-Win."" 

You can buy all the most OP guns with in-game currency... I think they're confused."
20736,the game was fun until showing up the some fucker using hack in the game and and no way to report it
20737,"This is a VERY GOOD GAME with excellent graphics I recommend it !!
"
20738,It's good i guess...
20739,"I'm sure it's a great game and all that, but this game requires connecting to US government IP's before you can even get to the menu.
No thanks."
20740,"Updated:
I have actually been able to play the game. It seems the addressed the mouse issue. Not a lot of time playing yet, but so far it's decent shooter. Bot and PvP rooms.

Will update when i get more time in-game, for now it's  a thumbs up. Even though I am a bit disappointedd in the lack of more direct support."
20741,"The gameplay is fairly decent, but it feels really cheap. I am not going to be complaining about the online users, but some shit they do doesnt add up. For instance, i was once crouching behind a wall and someone in a completely other section of the map somehow managed to shoot me somehow. My biggest complaint is that the matches give you VERY VERY little money. 400-500$ per match (if you win) and having the guns cost at the minimun of $96,000, makes for a painstakingly long grind to get that weapon, to the point to where i just logged in every day for a week to be able to afford a shotgun. The next complaint comes from the fact that i havent been able to play the past two days anyway because it's ""Down for maintenance"" but what takes this long to maintain?"
20742,fix your sound and you reloading.
20743,"i like the game and i like the guns and the mechanics 
but the maps are bad 
every map is just 1 side is the side where you can camp
and the other is just where you get fucked over becuse you cant do shit 
the game needs to change maps so there arent that many camping spotsbecuse the game just becomes boring
with all of the campers 
fix pls"
20744,"god damn its a good game but their are way too many hacker just like unturned back in the good old days lol.

you need a better anti cheat...

if you still play this game then you are loser this game so trash now it has turn into shit show

i seen atleast 100+ hacker get banned thanks keep up the good work.

20748,"First of all, this game is sweet. 
It reminds me of Call of Duty 4, not too fast good feel on the guns and overall smoothness.

There are only two things i would like to see changed in this game...
[olist]
[*] Nerf the insta kill snipers.. Insta kill on headshot? Sure.. on body? No.
[*] Nerf/Remove the grenade launchers. they do too much damage for their rof and amount of usage.
[/olist]

The matchmaking feels non existent, on my second match i was playing against people who were a lot higher in level than i was and most of the time they were full premade groups :-("
20749,"Reminds me of COD in some ways, and Rainbow Six Siege in other ways.

However, THIS GAME IS NOT CSGO.

I repeat, THIS GAME IS NOT CSGO.

I'm done with my life. Smashing my keyboard was a sign from Lord Gaben that this game is not worth it.

But I'd recommend to COD players, 9/10"

20754,"Black Squad is a neat FPS Game, it is rather fun, and while it has very minimal pay to win elements, (better guns, and more selection). It is fairly well balanced, weapon wise despite the liberal distribution of gernade launchers (they have explosive free matches). 
One thing that majorly detracts from this game, is in later matches after you have warmed up and the mm starts to put you with window lickers and high pingers, it gets pretty agrivating, the highpingers especially, they get a major first sight advantage when peaking due to the generous amount of interpolation, to the point that trying to peak against them is suicide unless you too have 2-300 ping, it breaks certain maps.
There is also liberal use of lag/packetloss switchess to make their charictar teleport from point to point, at times it is pretty broken. 
They do have a great anticheat, only seen one person with an obvious wall/esp head baninging people behind crates and corners out of the blue, Battleeye the best in the buissness, but due to the developers lazy net coding, lag & packet loss is exploited to the extreme. 
Maps are microsopic for the most part, there are a few game modes where it is reasonable for the game mode but for the most part way to small, I dont know if it is due to the engines limitiations or the developers willingness to tax the clients pc or their servers by making them larger.
Shooting mechanics are over simplified, shooting while running in sidestep for ex. if you are looking for something to kill an hour or two while you wait for something to cook or before work, sure it is fairly viable fresh experiance. but after a few hours of play, or to play as a main fps game it leaves to much to be desired for me to bother putting any money into it to support the developers.


TLDR:
Pros: 
- Fast Paced
- classic fps, & counterstrike like game modes and elements
- some variety of characters and gear
- pay2win is not as ever preasent as in many other f2p games.
- could be a fun basic shooter game to play with friends, & clanmates.
- push buttion loadouts, (great idea)
- ballstic object penitration
- rather light resource wise (probably good for crappier computers)
- matchmaker seems reasonably fast.

Cons:
- Lag exploitation!
- Phone booth sized maps 
- no actual customization of weapons (preset attachment loadouts)
- very slight P2W element in the weapon selection and capabiliy compaired to non premium weapons.
- high pingers are not kicked or seperated from people of <100 ping, 
- a little to many gernade launches in game in general.
- very simple/basic shooting mechanics, rediculious run and gun side strifing is possible, head shots are also not 1 hit kill except for sniper rifles.
- limited selection of armor/character appearance.
- poor map design, TDM modes tend to devolve into spawn camping halway holding slaughters no matter what team you are on.

the one thing that prevents me from recomending this game above all else is the lag explotation, and bad net code. If it was less prevelant, or mm matched players aproprietly to ping I would have given it a recomend. but until then you should wait to see if they address these issues before diving in and potentially ruinging your experiance with the game long term.

20755,"This game was more enjoyable then expected. Its more of a fast paced style FPS. The graphics are not great, but it works for any level PC. Deffintily worth a try."
20756,"Great game but I would recommend a name change. If you shorten Black Squad you get BS, which in my opinion isn't really a good abbreviation. I would recommend you use a different BS alternative instead. Other then the name, I really enjoyed playing with BS."
20757,"Great game! Played a lot! Enjoyed a lot as well. If you are a FPS fan, then get this game. If you are not owning this game and u like FPS games, then what's wrong with you!"
20758,"This game is a huge pay to win. I hope the developers abandon this game.
"
20759,"Worst FTP action shooter played this year. 
To not be so much negative about that, I would say that this game would be good in 2014 or earlier, but with hudge amout of FTP shooter games which are out, this gameplay, graphic, controls etc. is too old when you compare it with others. 
And I almost forgot.. it's a weird combination of cs:go and CoD which doesn't came very pleasnt from this developers."
20760,"it runs pretty decent on my pc which is not very good, thats all i have to say"
20761,"It is like a even more retarded CoD :))
Do not play this shit !
I can't understand how any normal FPS player should like this crap :/"
20762,nice game
20763,Please nerf grenade and please ban people with 100 ping in asia servers please ffs 5/10
20764,this game is like a free cs:go. It's actually really fun!
20765,"It's in the early Access, but no, dont bother, if you have ever played AVA, this is basically this but muuuchhh worsee, less features and worse gameplay, ava has little recoil etc. Terrible mechanics of every single old school fps with progress unlockables. not worth your time, unless they rebuild from ground up"
20766,"this game is basicly the love child of cs and cod 
pros 
-nice guns and gun animations
-f2p 
-runs good 
-you can choose between crosshair and sight 
-you can customize your crosshair 
-many aspect ratios

20774,It wasnt really a solid shooting game. it feeld a bit clunky. and the setting i hit for my laptop not even balanced well. hell i even play modern warfare 2 and 3 still get better frame rates than this. but overall its not that pay to win type of f2p game.
20775,HELP ME :my game has a erro code
20776,Junk
20777,"I don't see what the MAJOR negative reviews claim yet. I enjoy this game so far. The only thing I would say is that it needs the sprint option, and possibly more health/armor, whatever matters more. The fact you can die by basically one shot from every gun is slightly annoying. 
But OVERALL I really like the potential this game has."
20778,;P
20779,"This game has a horrendous menu interface
This game has a horrendous, glitchy tutorial
This game has a horrendous map design
This game has a horrendous control setup
This game has a horrendous....ly amount of people who dont say or type anything 
This game has a horrendous effect on the soul with how tedious it gets 

So why am I recommending it?

For an early access game
This game has decent visuals
This game has decent gunplay (but needs work)
When people talk, This game has a decent community
No Pay-to-Win system. At all. Seriously

If this company had more support, maybe the game could be more, but as it stands it feels just like any f2p fps and it gets boring quite quickly. My first impression was also bad because the tutorial was buggy beyond belief and was poorly done. Im recommending it though because if they can overhaul these god awful maps, and revamp the menu completely, then this game has plenty potential.

Edit: I'll address some of the comments here.
     1. The tutorial may not have been glitchy for you, but considering I reviewed the game based on MY experience instead of yours, I'm going to put that it is wasn't the best experience. Don't like it? Tough.

     2. I am by no means saying this game is complete. It still needs ALOT of work. But considering that I have heard that the devs are putting in alot of work into the game, then I trust they will listen to their fans to make the game better. If my understanding of that is incorrect, or if I am misinformed, then I will change my recommendation for this game because that is literally the reason it was tipped from not rec. to rec. If No Man's Sky gets recommended because the devs decided to work on their game, then this deserves it too (for an early access anyway).

     3.  When I typed ""dont say or type anything"", I didn't know there wasn't any voice chat at all. Either way VERY FEW players say anything at all in the text box, literally with many matches passing by before I found one person willing to say hello. The community matters too and if they dont say anything, then the game suffers for it. Granted at least it isnt toxic, but hearing toxic players whine is more entertaining than feeling I'm playing against bots. 

     4. There may be alot of maps, but they all blur into a mesh of poor design and generic gamemodes. I don't really care how many there are, for an early access, I'd rather have a small bite of steak that makes me want more vs a large buffet of crap sprinkled with cheese.
 
     5. I played this with a friend on his account for a few hours. while 3 hours there and another half here isnt much, its still plenty of my life to judge a free game based off my time of it. I'm not going to spend another 3 just to make sure there might be something that I missed that would completely change my outlook of the game because I'm pretty sure there isn't.

What is funny is how sensitive everyone is being over the fact that I called this game a mess with potential, when I'm giving the game a recommendation because I believe in the fact that if games with potential are recieving care and attention from the devs and could be good, I want others to see it. I'm not going to lie about my opinions or experiences just because people, who have nothing better to do than to whine about reviews, don't agree.

FINAL EDIT
 
After doing some research on this game, I am changing my recommendation on this game. It literally is just another crappy, generic f2p, but my hope was that this game would be updated to something better. Considering it has been out for 3 years already, and only just released to the US as early access, I hold no hope of significant changes happening to this game. If I wanted to play a Call of Duty style game, I will play Call of Duty. I played this game for 3+ hours on multiple accounts, and I'm not wasting any more of my life on it."

20825,hello me encanta este juego solo que me dice connet fogin 299
20826,Dropped CS:GO and went for this game.
20827,Love this game. ^^
20828,"game is already plagued with cheaters. just like all others.  these losers just can't take losing.  pretty pathetic. game looks promising.  no way to report possible cheaters. and recent players do not come up on steam.  like they are encouraging the cheats.  not gonna waste good hard earned money on this game, not yet anyway.  needs much improvement. decent kill cam and anti cheat system.  but steam has failed in all those areas.  maybe a bot driven version or lan/friends version would be okay for a while but will bore you soon.  not enough maps for tdm.  no dom or team defender.  cheaters eat shit and die."
20829,"Do I reccomend this game? no.
Will I keep playing? sure. Apearntly I got nothing better to do.

Here is why this game sucks.

1:Shitty community. Full of people who think Having a high ping or using sweetfx gives you a ""advantage""

2:Shitty updates. We got a new server this update. to bad its still shit for australians and the communtiy think high ping is giving us an advantage. So they are still stuck with us and we still have to deal with their BS.

3:Stereo typical TDM maps. Now, some maps are fine. But the amount of spawn camp maps that are just shipping containers and nothing but shipping containers is not only lazy but straight up anoying.

4:Player collision. Your rockets, nades and bullets do NOT go through teammates. This means if a team mate steps in front of you as you launch a missile. Youc ommit suicide while he dumbly walks around wondering what happened then gets shot.

5: Too many currencies. There are 4 in total. First I will call ""gold"". The next I dont even have to change. its called ""BS"" or black squad. Next is medals. Then finally Your cash shop money. There is no need for this much. Im only level 30 and I have 10k+ of each (minus cash shop of course)

6: Pay2Win. Whoa. I know. Shocking. This game says its not Pay2Win. now sure. I can agree there. But its 100% possible in the future considering the current system. In random boxes you either get your gold, BS or medals. These are the most common. Otherwise its a skin. Now, currently most weapons are about 100k. What I did was spent some of my own money to see the chances of getting skins. Turns out, pay enough money, and you can earn 500k gold, 50k medals and 50k BS. Thats enough to buy 5 regular weapons, 5 (give or take) medal items and then using the BS you can buy EXCLUSIVE skins.... if you get more because its all super expensive. So yea. All they have to do is release a real OP weapon then BAM! No need to grind just spend some cash money.

7: Lies. The trailers and product page show off characters that are currently avalible in the korean version. One thats far more updated than ours. Long story short, that means if you see something you like on the product page, ignore it. It might not even be in the game yet. Example being, the female models. not at all in the game. Some of the maps only just started coming into the game even though they were in the korean version already.


Positives?

There are a few.

1: its easy to get into. Just jump in and play. simple as that.

2: Its unreal engine 3. Now I know UE4 is new and shiny. But devs using unreal engine have far more experince using UE3, moving over to UE4 can be a hassle. So making a F2P game run on a new engine isint the best of ideas. As can be seen by the many MANY horrible UE4 games on steam. Most arent even Free which is the sad part.

3: Game file size. its only 5gb!! Now, I dont have an issue with drive space. But to me having a game this big only be 5gb is quite nice and definitely a selling point.


TL:DR: Community is shit. We having missing content. Game has player weapon collision. Something only games where team killing exists would have (cant team kill in this)."
20830,"Great game overall really fun, only problem i see is a couple hitbox issues hits not registring sometimes could be a server problem not sure.
if soloq ranked comes out this game is perfected"
20831,very nice game
20832,"we need mid-east servers. and this game should have voice chat for better gameplay, like i need better comunication with my teammates when i play, because i don't always play with my friends."
20833,"I've been playing this game for 26 hours since the past 3 weeks.
Im playing with a HP Pavilion g4 series Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit AMD A4-3305M APU with Radeon(tm) HDgraphics 1.9Ghz and 4GB ram.
.
First of all i would like to thank the devs for hearing our feedback and always twitching and inform any updates on this game. Altho the dlc's are expensive, i will buy it to support the devs and hope the game will continue to grow bigger and better. :D
.
PROs
1) Graphics are quite good, of course it didnt reach the peak that you're expecting but what do you hope from a FreeToPlay (FTP) game.
2) The gameplay is smooth, although im from asia playing in europe and south/north america with high ping doesnt effect my gameplay. The best part is they finally added Asia Server.. Thanks Devs
3) Variety of Gameplays, If u wanna partake in kills u could go for the TeamDeathMatch (TDM) , if u wanna go for the team objectives u could play Demolition , Assasinations and BattleMatch. Every gameplay gave u a different experience from every game such as CounterStrike and COD
4) As an EarlyAccess game, the Devs did quite a great job informing and taking feedbacks from the community, Twitching and Streaming. This game has a bright future with their devs being very active and wanted to improve the game to make it the best fps in this era
.
CONs
1) too many controls. I suggest the devs to recreate the controls like CS:GO. U can just have 1 button to interact so i dont have to plant bomb with this.. and defuse bomb with that.. run with this... switch the weapon with that.. sometimes it annoys me and sometimes it gave me a headache.
2) A really simple way for clanning. Devs, u should set for someone to make a clan, they must pay. With this style of Free-Clanning, people won't come to any clans and just make their own. So what's the use of having a clan system if people would just make their own clan and will have 1 player that is himself in the clan.
3) The system of matchmaking, u should start matchmake people according to their ranks or elo points maybe. I dont like how... when im a SSG step 4 and suddenly i got matchmaked with a newbie.. and it all turns to a 1 hard carry game.
.
I guess that's all.. I recommend u this game and buy the dlc's to support the developers. I give it a 6/10."
20834,must play game no pay to win game all you require is skill
20835,"If you want a midpoint between Counter Strike and Call of Duty, this is your game."
20836,"This is the first game I've actually YELLED at my screen in quite a while, probably since MW2 days. Cant put this game down. The guns feel so good; the maps are roomy enough so that you're not on top of each other, but small enough to keep the action fast-paced and exciting. I'm excited to see what's to come out of this game. Definitely worth the FREE DOWNLOAD"
20837,UTHERLY TRASH
20838,amazing game decent players and one of the best free to play fps games ive playeds
20839,best game i ever played
20840,Reminds me of the good ol days of soldier front....with out all the hackers and pinoys 10/10
20841,"Bacically Counter Strike, Battlefield and Call Of Duty had a threesome and had a Savant."
20842,"Awesome game, I love it!"
20843,wow..
20844,it aight
20845,Not P2W.Only things that need real money are skins.And most importantly:it doesn't have a toxic community.
20846,"its a counterstrike copy. its a little fun, but it has the clunkiest tracking issues ive experienced in a possitively rated shooter in a long while. I dont suggest it, most because I didnt enjoy it."
20847,"Very good game, I love this game, It is good."
20848,A promising FPS game that combines Counter Strike movement with Call of Duty gun handling. The execution is damn near flawless.
20849,"Great game I recently hit 28 days logged in, in a row and it recet me back to 1 day (didnt reset stats or currency, just the login count) and ive gotta say im not mad. Im excited to work back up to the 28 days again"
20850,Mom can I have 60 dollars for the new shitty cod? No.
20851,"Could someone fuck up the controls more???!!!Controls suck sooo much...If you will fix it ill come back to this game.You will laugh when you will see my time spend at game,but I just cant play this even for a minute more."
20852,"This game is awful. I picked it up because there were plenty of positive reviews but now that I've played it I realize there's nothing special here. The sound effects are HORRID. Someone could be standing two feet away from you and the gunshots will sound exactly the same as they do twenty feet away, or behind a wall, or across the map. On the topic of audio, the sound mixing is really atrocious. Every time you get a kill it plays an extremely loud stock gore sound effect which can't be turned down or disabled, this is aggravating to say the least. Every single gun is the exact same thing. You either take an accurate high rate of fire gun with no recoil (TAR-21), or a high damage low rate of fire gun with lots of recoil. (Any AK, HK14) The sniping is a joke because there is no scope sway if you move while scoped in. Shotguns are useless because they don't one shot and most rifles with kill you in 3 to 4 shots. The music is cringy, the ping is terrible, the translations are laughable (e.g. ""It was too hard"" is an actual voice line on defeat). The classes are groan-inducing and only available on the worst game mode, they're just in the game just so they can say it's a class based shooter. None of the weapons are purchasable for any time other than permanent. This wouldn't be a problem if they gave you more money, but after playing for a couple hours I only have enough for one very cheap gun and a rifle. (About 220,000 for both, all of which came from the money they start you with) and you get around 800 currency in a round where you did really well. The single redeeming feature of this game is the detailed gun models, which isn't even that big of a deal because you'll only be able to own two or three of these guns (besides the default three) before running out of currency and grinding TDM lobbies full of wall hackers and poor sports.

tl;dr This game is bad, play something else."
20853,PLease add SEA servers !! i really love it
20854,ni
20855,"Take grenades out of the game please they are a ******* joke.

Otherwise 10/10 good F2P game."
20856,"movement was slow. they say no pay to win but you know, was not a fan"
20857,WHEN IS SEA SERVER COMING? IM DYING
20858,"While this game is full of Russians who barely know how to move their mouse, I think it's one of the better free to play games out there. First thought was, free to play? Must be full of hackers, it isn't. The game is a little bit unbalanced, but that's an easy fix, and can be excused as they're in early access.

Of course, since the game is indeed free-to-play, it will be plagued by hackers soon enough, there's plenty of them already and you'd be lucky to find a game with proper team mates.
The thing I certainly like the /most/ about this game, is the fact that the chat is hardly noticable, so it doesn't take up your entire screen if somebody types, and I usually don't even notice it. But back to the best part about this game, there's no voice chat. If you want a proper team, find some friends to play with and use Discord/Skype/... to communicate, but voice chat with randoms would be an absolute horror in a free-to-play, you'd need chemotherapy from all the cancerous Russians with dollar store microphones, and trollers.

I would certainly recommend this game (for now)."
20859,really decent f2p shooter
20860,Nice game. :D
20861,"Generic F2P FPS with nothing distinctive worth mentioning, dont play it unless you really REALLY dont have anything better to do.
btw South American servers are filled with toxic BRs and wallhackers (ideal combo)"
20862,"One of the best F2P FPS out there...it's not P2W at all either. You can obtain any gun in the game just by playing, plus you get to try almost all of them out for 2 weeks to decide which ones you want to use in-game money to buy. Highly recommended!!!"
20863,NICE GAME BRO!
20864,In some situations i cant even shoot or aim... Dont know why but this game is trash
20865,"Cool, easy gameplay; nice graphics; and very interesting modes. Developers please, do the customisation, and more weapons. You're best! Thx for this game


10/10 tac reloads"
20866,"Well i played only like 3 matches, and i am done with it, it was so bad experience :D And well if you are going to play it anyway, be prepared that you seriously need to adjust your sensitivity as soon as possible, if you wont..well you are done :D And NEVER, realy NEVER buy shotgun, its so bad that if i was running there with boiled noodles i will do more damage then with shotgun."
20867,this is probably one of the best FREE 2 PLAY First person shooter out there that i have seen. No pay to win since every weapon is obtainable through playing and no guns from boxes deals more damage than the regular version of that weapon.    Every day you log in you get 15k gold and every seventh day you log in you get 15k gold + 500 medals. the developers are continiously listening to player feedback and they release patches for the game weekly.   They have the usual TDM and Demolition game modes along with Assassination game mode where you either kill or defend an AI   V.I.P    They also have a mode called Battle match where you destroy the enemies 5 objectives and secect one out of four classes with the killstreaks you want to use however for this game mode gives you an in match rank you need the rank up in order to use the  later kill streaks.  This game is very fun i would recommend this game
20868,I played this game for a while but I can't recommend this unless they fix the high pingers and get better tick rate servers. You will  die behind a wall or people laging around.
20869,1/10...  Copy Of Counter strike global Offensive... Movement of this game isn't real...  Recoil system also not right too!! No fairness in game ! Should be copyright for copying csgo i guess. Server isn't good as well. Everything is bad because its a Free game Yeah.
20870,"Hackers and no Oceanic servers make this no fun for me, if there was servers and people getting banned it would be an amazing f2p shooter"
20871,From my short exp with this game so far its very fun game i like the fact its a decent free to play first person shooter but i only have one issue and thats the massive lag issues on there servers it gets the point i can barly play the game and i tell you its not my laptop because my laptop is a high end gaming laptop i guess what i am saying is this game has a lot of potential but they need to optimize there servers better to help get rid of most the lag that makes the game extremely difficult to play on my end anyway but other then the not so good optimized servers i would recommend this game to others. but this game is still in early access so maybe down the road they will manage to work the issues out with the servers.
20872,its shit
20873,"Only got mad and cried, nothing more, also sensitivity options are broken.
Black Squad - 100x worse cersion of CS GO

0/10"
20874,"its a free game and dont listen to the idiots who say this is a bad game. For it being free it sure does its job, think of csgo mix with cod. Not saying its a great game but its not bad at all. give it a shot, its a FREE game."
20875,v bad is like cod of duty but take too many shot to kill little baby boy - slav
20876,"EDITED 16/09/2017

Seeing as there are kids (or maybe it's the devs using alternate accounts , fuck knows), who can't afford buying a game and can only play free games like this one , commenting and saying how bad my review is and how I should go play something else , which apparently means I can't rate this game based on my experience and and give my opinion about it (lol) , I've decided to change this review :

Bad game. 


Have a nice day."
20877,"I take back what i said previously, realised you have to change the sensitivity for each preset... DERPDERPDEDERPDERP"
20878,"SHIJT game so not balanced ur 1 shot kill, u cant even walk everyone is camping"
20879,Fínasta skemmtun
20880,This Game Sucks!! You must really improve the fucking servers. I AM PLAYING LIKE A HALF ROUND AND THEN I GET KICKED COUSE OF AN UNKNOWN ERORR!!! THIS GAME SHOUDENT BE ON STEAM!! Steam NEEDS GOOD GAMES NOT THIS SHIT!!! PLEASE DO SOMETHING VALVE!!!!  AND REMEMBER: DO NOT INNSTALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20881,nice game
20882,"I came into this game expecting Squad, or Battlegrounds type gameplay. Instead, just another Call of Duty. Literally every 5 seconds there is an airstrike, and the maps are entirely too small to handle the amount of constant barrage of explosions everywhere. If you cant afford CoD, then this is fine. Also, watching a guy turn into a juggernaut WALK THROUGH AN AIRSTRIKE plus the barrage of bullets firing at him and team whiping the other team SOLO is a little ridiculous...."
20883,"The game is alright, sucks that you can't run in the game, only time you can run is having a knife. But overall an ok game."
20884,"Great game, anyone who played combat arms will enjoy this... Not pay to win at all."
20885,great game >D
20886,Neary everyone who plays on the North American server is from Asia and has 250+ ping. Don't waste your time.
20887,NOT RECOMMENDED YET. STILL NO SEA SERVER GG
20888,"This game is good FTP but poorly made:
- Still few bugs.
- Hacks; i'm not sure if it's free hack game, but i have seen speedhacks who ended destruction game in few seconds.
- PING?: no ping check or limits? maybe now in quick but not in custom? i have played sniper and melee with 600 ping!
if you shoot at him you won't kill him but if he shoot next to you he will kill you. melee too they can kill you from 10m away with a knife and you have spear and can't kill them. i played TDM with player with 800 ping and he killed me with a grenade which i didn't see because it wasn't there. it just poped up and blew me. (it's important devs allow room masters to make custom ping check. if i want to play a good game with not lags. i would set ping to 200 max. so no more delay and unkillable players with range like a pike!)
- More servers (ASIA is most important) for PING like above. and most important because i'm playing in europe servers and most asia players play with 300 ping which is very laggy and game stopper.
- Force player to server: (game should autoconnect players to nearest server. There is 3: Europe, North America, South America. (I have seen american players use europe server to use ping to their advantage espiecally in melee and sniper).

In overall it's a good game but kinda lazy devs. i would recommded it after 2-3 months when no more 1000 ping players are playing freely."
20889,"Rlly nice game, it's so catchy !!"
20890,"this game is by far the best free to play shooter.
but...
pls add more guns"
20891,"This is the best F2P game I've played and even better it's a shooter! 

I'll address some issues people have been mentioning in the negative reivews first. 

Ping - Some people have complained about ping on the servers being too high, I've been playing on EU servers for about 2 weeks now and have never gone above 30 ping. 

Hackers - I've yet to find a hacker in game but am often accused of being one. 

People of other regions joining - There is a high ping auto kick system in place that doesn't allow this to happen. 

Okay, now on to some of the pros. 

Developers - The developers of the game from what I've witnessed have listened to the community and are often transparent through their patch streams on twitch.tv

Guns - The guns for the most part are balanced, you don't see everybody with the same assault rifles running around and each gun appears to have it's advantages and limittations. 

Gameplay - I mainly play the 5v5 demolition as I've come from CS:GO, Insurgency and CoD. This mode I get the most enjoyment out of but they also have other game modes such as TDM and a protect the VIP as well as a 16 v 16 ""battle mode"" which I've tried and is actually really fun and unique. In terms of the 5v5 demolition the only thing I would change is the short bomb timer for the time the defending side has to defuse. It's around 45 seconds right now I believe which is very short especially if you're on the other side of the map. 

Gun Mechanics - The gun mechanics feel like a mix between CS:GO and CoD. They're hard to describe in words but recoil with some guns can be a b**** and you might wanna learn to start popping heads.

Community - Overall the community within the game seems to be active with 5v5 clan wars ongoing. This being said I struggle to chat with my teammates with a lack of voice comms which should really be added into a game of this type. 

Overall this game is fun, f2p, and definitely worth a shot. If you believe I left anything out of this review or wanna play sometime on EU servers feel free to add me!"
20892,awesome game.
20893,I must amend my earlier negative review now that there are servers near me.  This is one of the better f2p and not p2w FPS games on steam.  If you;re a fan of the CoD style FPS games i suggest trying it out.
20894,"shit game
"
20895,"Great game ""Absolutely No Pay to Win"" Kappa its still early access anyways 11/10 would play with my squad."
20896,"This game is great, unlike Squad. That game you can't get a single kill without dying dozens of times. But in this game, we can get a few kills in before our first death. I like the rifle that looks similar to the M16 (or M4, however you see it as). On the other hand, it needs a bigger arsenal of pistols and the ability to customize our rifles/ pistols to our liking."
20897,its a nice free game to play
20898,the most realistic game i have ever played in my enitre life
20899,"It is free, runs acceptably on old machines, and you get daily rewards and stuff. No real money pay to win.

There the good things end, sadly. Who plays frequently buys some imbalanced weapon and has, let us say, a single shot killer shotgun. Run around, ignore all fire from ridicuously weak MPs, and kill mobs by the dozen.

Odd settings, a hell of a mess of an invite system for team-gaming, and then the shooting itself. 

Grenade launcher (in tutorial) does not even damage enemies, a vector (my first weapon of choice) misses a mob in 2 meters on full auto, as though all bullets vanish in thin air. Four headshots with my vector on enemy, and he still stands, and kills me with two basic rifle shots. End. Game over - if you want somewhat fair gaming go and play CS-GO. 

I bet Paladins offers more fun, unless you want to enjoy a somewhat lackluster balanced and programmed game - grenade physics are from an alternate universe. I really expected something with a feel of CS, but was sadly disappointed."
20900,"I really enjoy this game, and its perfect for the current desktop I have right now. only problem is after a recent update it crashes on launch which really sucks. ill try and get it fixed, but for those who that problem doesnt apply to, download this game. super fun!"
20901,"Never tell your password to anyone.
3:12 PM - Empress~: Black squad
3:14 PM - Empress~: Who r u fighting, white squad?
3:14 PM - Scout: lag
3:14 PM - Scout: I'm fighting lag



."
20902,"Um lixo, toda hora da disconect, vai se fuder
"
20903,"In short, this game is reincarnation of AVA.  If you are looking for a mindless, fast paced, arcade shooter then this has a potential.  It is not as demanding as newest releases, looks decent, and can be optimized for a better performance.  Game elements are tried and true – nothing exceptional or bad there.  From personal experience, what drags this game down is the amount of lag.

Servers must be improved and ping locked.  If they are, it is not working.  People with ridiculous pings are joining, playing and dominating games – which makes one wonder about presence of cheating, as well.  I don’t know about you, but if I want to play a competitive FPS, I want the online experience to be smooth.  Otherwise, what is the point of playing?  
Desire for frustration and self-punishment?

Thumbs down for now.  If online performance improves, I will update this to thumbs up.  Otherwise, forget it.


"
20904,"Pros:Nice population,Enough game modes,Kinda enough map variety.Many updates happening to increase gameplay quality.
Dis:Not balanced weaponary yet (I think).Clans dont give any benefits to followers.

Still fine game."
20905,"Got to SFC Step 4 in 12 hours.  Was entertaining for a bit, but too arcadey for my personal taste.

It plays like Unreal Tournament with objectives, if you're playing Battle Mode, the best mode, which has a 4 classes, each with their own deal that cost skill points to use in Battle. 

You get points in battle mostly by attacking enemy boxes (most people use knives for +12 points each quick swipe and not as much noise as weapon fire), which you spend on skills, like Claymore, UAV Recon, and some high-tier 1000 point skills like air strikes and artillery.

Doesn't seem like the Command's Helicopter Support is working at the moment, though.  It's mostly a 300 XP pinata right now.  Fortunately, Command has AT4, which can be a boon or a cancer, depending on if you're using it, or it's being used to one-shot you like the Quake Rocket Launcher: bunny-hop one-shots, often multi-kills, and accurate at all ranges, so you can shoot them at people and objectives, through windows etc.

You at least get warning when air strikes and artillery are coming at you, but there's no teamkill damage, so you can just fire at will with whatever support options you have, unless you frag or air strike yourself.

Teammates can block your shots, though.  Lost more than a few AT4 to people running right in front of it.  Ended up killing myself once this way: guy moved in front at the last second, he got hit in the back of the head, and I died from my own explosion.  Genius.

This game really needs teamkill damage.  Otherwise, there isn't much thought put into your skill use other than where to put it.  If your friendlies are in the air strike area right now: send it, they'll be fine.

Gunplay needs some work.  As is, submachine guns are super-accurate at any range you can get the shot on, and shotguns are obscenly powerful well past believable range, and bolt-action sniper rifles are capable of one-shotting people in the knee while the sniper is bunny-hopping.  

Snipers are racking up the big scores right now, because Recon+bolt action tends to be like having an ESP hack with a one-shot weapon, so snipers are leading killboards each game.  I didn't even want to buy the bolt-action, because I was already an AT4/Shotty cancer player, and I didn't want to become a Claymore/Hellpike/Bolt Action cancer player, too.

The balance in this game needs more work, but it is in early access, so please leave feedback on wherever the devs are listening.

Overall, I enjoyed my time in, but I'll wait to see what happens as it develops after leaving my feedback on the issues I saw."
20906,"Compared to the flagships in the FPS category, this misses to deliver a good feeling in terms of weapon handling and map design.

Some maps I wasn't sure wether to call large or small.. wether to pull out the Sniper or the SMG. The Red-Dot-Sight barely brings any improvement, the Grenade-Launcher on the other hand seems to be the way to go.

Just judging this as is, it's worth a try for sure. It's free, not pay2win and cheaters are rare.
Yet I uninstalled and went back to other, purchasable FPS."
20907,"Very good free game, its easy to get the hang of due to its simpleness with other FPS games such as CS go. the graphics and gusn can be debated between players in the community. however to improve the game. there needs to be some sight image fixing, for example the huge mass of the holograpic compared to the red dot. 

also add micraphone's to the game, it feels very anoying not being able to talk to teammates and give them info.
Buying the equipment at the begging of the round would also make the game more player orentated, not needing to buy the gun. but to use a holographic sight, or laser E.T.C. and have a set limit of money or number of equiptment. so you can equipt yourself for your playstyle or tactics"
20908,No budget for CS:GO or COD? Go Potato Gaming!
20909,"So many things are done right in this game but also so many things are done wrong in this game.
The weapons look nice, the aim is good, the reload is good but then the amount of ammo you have is low. Running is only possible with knife and thats quite stupid. Damage model is super terrible cmon half a mag for one guy. one shot headshot is not kill. I expected leaning out of cover like in rainbow six but no. you got a game that is trying to pretend to be a fast shooter but its not a fast shooter. Online service is great. overall its good that this game is free because at the moment i think its still unfinished"
20910,"Don't get fooled by the positive reviews.
This game is completely filled with Pay To Win.
AND HOW COME A KOREAN GAME DOESNT INCLUDE AN ASIA SERVER? 250 FTW BOI OOOHHH WEEEE!!!
First of all, the menu is shit. Its confusing, simplify it and it won't be an issue.
Second, the game netcode is complete shit, i shot to that guy 10 bullets before he turns around, he shot me once and I'm dead.
Third, the game pretty much is a combine of many fps game. And trust me its shit. It doesnt work. The aim sight is somehow horrifically slow, I'm not sure if this is intended, but as default, being that low is fucking shit.
Forth, the first thing i mention, Pay to Win. Dont fucking give me that grenade for 7 days for fuck sake. Either dont give it to me or give it to me permanently. You can buy a shit OP gun for real money.
The gameplay is just fucking trash overall, people are constantly spamming grenade every fucking time they die. The damage is ridiculously huge even at far range. Smokes and Flashes are basically right next to useless.

TL;DR: gameplay is trash, no asia server, pay to win."
20911,""" Absolutely no Pay-to-Win. """
20912,"September 5 -

Sniper precision, 10/10.
Default mouse sensibility, 10,10.
Sniper precision, 10/10.


Good game for who has problem with aiming on snipers, cause if you aim into the body, the bullet will just go on somewhere else, so..
by this logic, you can just aim in somewhere else, and you will get a lot of head shots.

Still, best Sniper precision,  10/10


December 19


i've downloaded the game again and i had a surprise! the game stills a piece of shit! a waste of time!"
20913,"[b] First thing I have to say is Black Squad is one of the best F2P FPS at this time . This game has enough features to keep you playing for hours . It's a mix of Call of Duty and Counter Strike . You can easily jump into battle without any skills or practices . It has a lot of modes , so you can choose which one suit for you . The weapons are balance and cheap , you don't have to waste much  time to farm money like other FPS games . And they don't need to be repaired , either . So when you buy one , you keep it forever :)  [/b] 

[h1]    PROS    [/h1]

+ Good Graphics ( in my opinion ) 
+ Low specs
+ Balanced weapons 
+ A lot of maps and modes 
+ Free To Play but not Pay To Win
+ Easy to control ( even for newbie )
+ A lot of features but not too complex 

[h1]    CONS    [/h1]

- Music theme is bad ( not a big problem )
- Customization is annoying . You have to put laser sight or silencer on your gun every time you respawn , there 's no way to put them at default . 

[h1]    Score : 8  / 10 . Recommended   [/h1]"
20914,"A great FPS for no price, but it would be greater if there were more servers throughout the globe especially a server for Asia"
20915,For a free game the foundation is here. Now dears devs work upon it and don't fak up with P2W!
20916,Best F2P Fps Game Eva!
20917,Good free FPS. No lag. For some reason there's only servers for EU & NA but you can still find a quick game if you just want gun and run with lots of ppl.
20918,Not worth time. And... alt+f4 does not work
20919,It feels like an ios game!
20920,good shit
20921,"Too cheap game, i'll play CS: 1.6 rather than this."
20922,for a free to play game its pretty darn good! i havent spent a dime yet but i might soon to help the devs out.
20923,Kajagajk
20924,"Don't listen to the reviews. This game feels like a cell phone game that was ported to PC.

20925,im so good at this game that it isnt even fun also way to many fucking hispanics
20926,Alway been kick by high ping
20927,"[i]Edit: Almost an year later nothing has changed.
- This installs their own spyware launcher and it installs the battleye spyware as well.
- Runs like shit, unoptimized.
- Items are still with limited duration, nothing is permanent except for the worst items.
- In-game currency bullets can only be obtained with real life money.
- There are random messages on the screen of some random people receiving rare stuff from boxes. That is so shady and it's used to suck in gullible people who have gambling addiction.
- The only ""decent"" rewards you get are the daily login ones. Typical garbage practice from Asian publishers and mobile games. The shit you get from actually playing the game is completely useless.

The publisher of this asset flip thinks people have to purchase cosmetics with real life money if they want them. LOL In case you didn't notice, this works ONLY if your game is actually good and not an asset flip Asian shitbag infested with cheaters.[/i]
[h1]AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS![/h1]

[h1]This is another Asian FPS asset flip. If you have played one of them you have played them all.
Same models(different clothing), same menus, same game mechanics, same physics, same cosmetics, same weapons available to you only for few days unless you buy permanent ones with real money. Avoid at all costs and stick to FPS games made by AAA publishers.[/h1]

Can't obtain the paid currency ""bullets"" by simply playing the game. Considering how expensive the cosmetics are compared to how low the quality of the game is I can only recommend AGAINST buying any cosmetics. Since you cannot obtain any cosmetics there is literally no point playing the game if you have CSGO. If you are sick of the cheaters in CSGO and you want to play BS thinking there won't be any cheaters in it you are out of luck. You will find plenty of cheaters here as well. Also this game comes from Asia, Asian games very rarely live more than 2-3 years, this has very high chance of dying at some point. Just take a look at what happened to Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - First Assault Online on Steam. A great game ruined by stupid Asian publisher, the same thing will happen to this game except this game isn't nowhere near the quality of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - First Assault Online. This game is an asset flip. There are other Asian free-to-play FPS games that have the same assets as well. It's using Unreal Engine which is the most popular engine and it's normal for most free-to-play games to be asset flips."
20928,"REVIEW: Good game, well make!"
20929,"scoped aim is horrendous, and the overrall aim of the guns in the game is just bad. i play a lot of FPS games and this one is one of the worst aim mechanics i've played recently."
20930,Actually Black Squad is a superb game and I Recommand it for all Gamers.
20931,Yes its a good game but .... its confusing bc the tutorial is miss leading with the air strike n shit like that so I recomend it 6.5/10
20932,Punishes you too much for body shots. You'll have to dump about half a mag into someone before they die.
20933,"If you enjoyed playing A.V.A or S.K.I.L.L SF2 in the past and got scared off by how the devs made it insanely pay to win. Then this might be the game for you! You will feel a lot of similarities. But this game actually does reward players for playing instead of paying, you can unlock powerful guns by earning medals which you can gain by playing and leveling up fairly easily. I've really enjoyed playing this game so far as the devs listen very well to community feedback and perform weekly updates that mold themselves to the communities crying calls for changes or new features. <3 U Bryan!"
20934,"Good graphics, good gunplay, a variety of weapons, decent maps and gamemodes, all for free. Yes there are some bugs and things that flat out don't work correctly, but that is to be expected from an early access game. All in all, a good free to play fps that isn't pay to win. 7/10"
20935,"I'm only not recommending it for fellow Aussies, there are no Australian servers making you choose from North America, South America and Europe.

But other than that the game's mechanical side is nice, movement is simple and the graphics are amazing. 

To critique a few things... getting a hit marker on someone sprays out silver(something)  everywhere and just look terrible, the Sensitivity needs to be simplified and for new buyers please find yourself the settings button because your eardrums will blow off when you go to splay the god awful tutorial.

Other then that just please understand that Australian Black Squad Lives Matter. Get some feckin servers.

20957,It's a nice game but nah you get bored fast too repetitive.
20958,yes
20959,"((Stop Kicking me out of your game if you want me to play it!

I can't even play one round of this game because after just one minute in the main menu i get a disconnect error and the game completely closes for some stupid reason. I can't recommend this shit unless this is being patched out!))
EDIT: THIS WAS FIXED, thank you.

Now that i got to try this game:
Its like counter strike mixed with warface, graphics are good, sounds are kinda annoying and some are way too loud, game is well optimized, great performance, 0 lag and even the menu reacts fast, gameplay itself is very fast paced (if not a little bit too much), you die pretty fast so watch out but its still alot of fun, makes you very ambitioned.
translations and bot AI suck reeeally bad tho

Oh and the Grenades are waay too overpowered, need nerf"
20960,Tac reload
20961,"This game has a great F2P model and honestly feels great to play, Aside from the lack of region locking. If you are NA at least you will be fighting 80-95% people with 200-400 ping. As such it pretty much kills the competetive feel and jsut starts to frustrate after your first few hours. 9-10 with region lock, 1/10 without it."
20962,"Black Squad is on of the better f2p games. All of the guns you can obtain through grinding out the levels and getting your daily rewards. It has a moderate learning curve, but that's what makes it pretty good. You don't have to have the best of guns, although the SR and AK are pretty good. The cost for the higher-tier weapons are reasonable, not making shell out $ irl in order to gain an advantage. These weapons can be purchased using Medals. Medals are awarded at the end of each week on your daily rewards, and also through ranking up.
Overall, its a very clean and simple shooter that's pretty easy to pickup."
20963,"I love this game and WOULD recommend the game.

Just a short note to the Dev's :

you can silence a sniper rifle so please allow us to do so. 
Next please add more bullet proof vests and weapons.
Add creats that conntain daily rewards like timed weapon rents and in game money.
Add a campain mod so we can earn in game money quicker to buy more gear.

Thank you."
20964,Cool game
20965,Great game.
20966,"I would not recommend this to anyone our side of America or Europe as there is no server support for elsewhere.
Im in Australia and until there is servers closer to me i cant recommend this game"
20967,"Hated game because AK OP.
Bought AK.
Now love game because AK OP."
20968,"I love this game.  It's almost everything that I've wanted from Counter-Strike that it doesn't deliver.

The graphics are gorgeous, highly detailed, with wonderul special effects.  Yes, they aren't current generation graphics, but compared to Counter-Strike?  They look amazing, and are exactly what I dream of when I think of Counter-Strike with better graphics.  

The sound is raw and gritty and supremely satisfying.  The sound of headshots is gory and rewarding, making me really cherish them.  And sound design is expertly done, focusing on clear and concise noises that clearly indicate where and what is going on.

The gunplay is tight, but quite forgiving.  This is basically a somewhat easier Counter-Strike, where your friends that lack First Person Shooting skills could still pick up some kills if they use a Sub Machine Gun, but will still lose to more skilled players due to superior recoil control, movement, etc.  

And the most key factor for me, matches only take 20-30 minutes as opposed to Counter-Strike's mostly hour long matches.  

And to top all of this off, the game is free and actually fair.  There's only one currency you can purchase with money, and you can't purchase any advantages with it.  The only ""advantage"" you can buy is either a $25 DLC that gives you a weapon and an exclusive skin for said weapon, or a $30 DLC that gives you 7 weapons.  All those weapons can be acquired in game and they also offer a 2 free DLCs that allow you to try two different sets of 7 weapons for 15 days each which can help you make informed purchase decisions.  

All in all, I hope this game succeeds and continues to grow and build an audience and improve itself."
20969,"This game can probably be good for someone that does not have a iphone because this game is basically a mobile fucking fps. Like i even think some mobile fps games have better graphics and quality of gameplay then this type of shit. I don't understand why this game is mostly postive when this game literally has the worst gameplay for a fps game. and one of the worst map designs i have seen in a while. Like why even add a fucking sniper class when all the maps are basically close ranged and everytime you try to snipe you fucking die by someone charging you with a smg that kills in like 3 shots. Like i can't say anything good about this game its just so bad. Please just save some money and buy games like: 
Csgo 
overwatch 
OR EVEN GET PALIDANS LIKE WTF AVOID THIS SHIT Xddddddddddd"
20970,good game
20971,better than csgo
20972,"This game is horrible. MAYBE would have been OK when Half Life 1 came out, but now?
- Graphics are a decade old
- Sound effects are horrible
- Gore visuals and sound are complete shit
- Game feels like an arcade
- Grenade physics is just absolutely pathetic
- Weapons feel and handle like toy guns
.......

This game is shit. Just pay already for ArmA3 / Squad, CS:GO, CoD, Battlefield or Rainbow Six: Siege, depending on what you like. All are MILES better than this game.

Uuuuh, it's free to play. Yeah, if you can't afford the, what, $10 for CS:GO, then have fun. Everyone else, you get what you pay for.

Also, NO GAME EVER should request admin privileges to run. EVER. Your game doesn't need them, your anti-cheat doesn't need them, just use an existing and well-established one, or at least get it out of the fucking game exe itself. That alone deserves an uninstall. I know this is common practice with eastern MMOs, and it's utter horseshit. Learn how to write secure programs, thx."
20973,"This is a AMAZING game! It has a battlefield feel to it, but with COD size maps. Going lone wolf can be fun, but i would say that you would get more kills if you tried a more tactical appproch to it. The guns are good, players are good, i would say that black squad is a 5 stay game. But don't take my word, please try it for yourself!"
20974,"I mean... if you mostly play free games, this sure is a free game. If you don't play free games, well... this game feels like a ten year old, free to play mess with gunplay about as stiff as a corpse of the same age. 

Hilariously awkward, with guns that lack any sort of satisfying feedback but kill in a second flat, maps are usually so small you can throw a grenade clear across them too. I guess I could say the class-based mode and maps are much better, larger and fun but we both know better so listen: No matter the metric this game is throughly mediocre as far as shooters go and the only reason you'd be playing this is if you can't play a paid one. If that's your case, shame. If you CAN buy literally any other shooting game in the market, go ahead and go do that because it'll be much better."
20975,"Netcode ain't that good. Has cheaters. 
Gameplay with too much kids blocking and bumping you."

20979,Pretty dank.
20980,"Great game would recomend for all
"
20981,Crap Game
20982,"In this review I'm not just going to say ""This game is terrible, rip off of CS:GO."" I'm going to list my pros and cons for this game. Either way, its a free game. Its not like you're spending $60 on this game and the reviews are going to determine whether you buy it or not. If you think you'd like it, play it.

That being said, I can't recommend this game. Putting 16 hours into this game I've found some things I really don't enjoy.

Starting off with the good stuff. The ability to buy guns without paying real money. This is a good concept to keep the game from being pay to win. Also, the daily rewards and rewards for ranking up are a nice addition, so it won't take that long to get the gun you wanted. Possibly only 5-6 rankups.

While I did have a lot of fun with this game, it isn't because of the game itself. Playing this with friends is like watching a movie that isn't terrible, but you laugh about its noticable flaws.

Some guns have little to no recoil, meaning you just hold mouse one and you can kill someone. Only select guns have noticable recoil (such as the AKs). This isn't good for a game that is already considered finished and an esport in some countries. Also, the damage is horrendous. You can unload 20 bullets into someone's chest from 5 feet away and they'll still be alive. I've experienced this many times myself. Snipers are too easy. There doesn't seem to be any penalty for missing a shot, because you can just crouch while locking in another bullet, and pop up and instantly shoot someone because there isn't any penalty for shooting while standing up. Also a lot of the snipers are one hit kills. Now you may say that ""It's just like the AWP in CS:GO  I don't see your problem,"" but in CS:GO at least you get punished for sniping while moving, uncrouching, jumping, ect. In CS:GO your movement speed is slower when you have an AWP. In Black Squad, there isn't that much of a speed difference. Hitreg seems really bad as well. You can be aiming right at someone and the bullet or knife won't hit, even if you are right in front of the person. People can join any server region they want so you need to deal with someone over 200 ping stuttering around the map. Please make dedicated servers so people won't join servers and have over 200 ping. Lastly, the community is so toxic. It seems like you can't join a 5v5 game and just have fun without someone being toxic on your team, or the other team. I know that the game devs can't do anything about this, but still, beware that people are very toxic on this game.

TL:DR This game has potential, but in its current state I can't recommend it. There are too many bugs and things that are just bad, like the gun mechanics and that isn't good, considering its out of early access and an esport in other countries. If you want to try this game, get it, its free, but I can't recommend it myself.

EDIT: Also forgot to add about how loud the game is, how slow the sensitivity is, and how weird the controls are during the tutorial, and you can't change them until you finish the tutorial. M3 doesn't seem to be a good key for spriting in my opinion."
20983,This is the retarded child of Counter Strike
20984,Great game i honestly recommend this game.
20985,"Ehh it is what it is.. for a FREE game its ok.. but that's it.. the controls are sluggish even after tweaking them, the lobbies and rooms a bit laggy when you are like one of two in the entire server with a ping under 40 and everyone else is  150 to 250. That in its self is a game breaker for myself... But again for a free game its not bad, if you can handle unrealistic gun handling, aiming, and movement. It's like an unreal tornement game with COD type guns and look, but without everything that makes those games what they are lol. Sorry it's a no for me!!"
20986,I was enjoying the game but became utter garbage once i went on the next day and everything reset as if my hotkeys and time put in didnt exist. WOULD NOT RECOMEND IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD SHOOTER
20987,"I think Black Squad is the surperior f2p fps game in the world right now. It makes Combat Arms look like childs play. Black Squad has a large amount of maps right now. This help's it in some ways, but it can be overwelming depending on the game mode(s) you play. 


The shooting mechanics are not like your CA, Crossfire, or AvA. Black Squad is unique in this regard. It shares some CS features as well. Just a lot more scopes, silencers, etc. Recoil is real on all the guns, and no scoping is almost nye ! It's great. That being said, quick scoping is very accurate, you'll notice that. 

I reccomend this game to anyone trying to escape all the fps shooters out there (f2p) ones. Save your selves and play this game !"
20988,No asia server = Unplayable
20989,"i tried this game some time ago and stopped playing cause the sensitivity system was trash. picked it up again and started to have a lot of fun with it, eventhough the sensitivity system is still trash. Also almost all ARs have a grenade launcher and its SO lame that they do like 60 dmg + each. its takes no skill. so tilting reeee. my salty review smile. :)"
20990,feels like a clunky mobile game.
20991,"i can't play the game guys. everytime i click start nothing happen, i already google all the possible solution even the solution in the forum. i love fps games and i have the interest to play this game so please fix this unknown bug for ""Us"" the gamers who has the same problem. (I still recommend this game, try to watch it on youtube)"
20992,"This game is amazing no fps drop even you have wooden pc,
 great server and also amazing pings balanced, if player have over pings or lagging so server kicked them it's auto. But the main problem is team balancing. And also they make it look like CSGO and COD but there is no device like COD that part of game it's not good otherwise game is awesome.
I give it 8 out 10.
"
20993,"It's acutally good game with good quality (u don't need expensive computer for that), good shooting game but it's free wich is not bad, but you can meet 'trollers' or some hackers. But it's new game so we can't expect absolutly awesome game with no isues. :)"
20994,Nice game :)
20995,"This game is one of the best games I've ever played!

I love (nearly) everything about it, from the guns to the maps to the gamemodes, everything is awesome.

My fav mode is 16 v 16 Destruction, even though it's 32 players, the rooms fill up really quickly, so you don't have to worry about grading.

I can run this perfectly, with nearly no lag (only 10% of my games are kinda laggy), even though my graphics card is integrated graphics and way below the minimum.

The graphics look great, and I love the idea of calling for artillery support, those things can really be a game-changer.

But there are a few things that I sort of dislike about the game.

For example, I get kicked from literally every single Quick Match that I try to play, I literally join the room and run for 2 seconds before I get kicked out from the game.

And also, It'd be great if there were fewer bots in BOT TDM mode, as me and only 1 or 2 other people go into the enemy's territory and there are literally like 20 NPC's swarming the room, and they easily kill us all.

But it isn't too much of a problem, as I like a challenge, but it'd be great if the devs could slightly decrease the amount of bots in BOT TDM mode, it would be much appreciated.

Overall, despite the one or two minor cons, this game is an awesome FPS and I'd happily spend dozens, if not hundreds of hours of my life on it. :)

9/10"
20996,"This game is a fusion of Counter Strike and COD. I like the graphics and different maps of this game, but I didn't like hold mouse scroll button to run. So I changed it to shift button which is better than default settings. Also default mouse sensitivity is too slow, which made me frustrated when I started the tutorial. It should be set in middle as default. Not only that, sniping is tough but it's fine. I would say that only graphics made me to like this game. So it's a recommended game from me. (Y)"
20997,Ping can't be above 200... How about you give the whole world dedicated servers then? t(-_-t)
20998,"it a really fun game i enjoy it but the sensertivity for this update is bad i want to old sensertivity

21003,"This game really fills the person into some energy, easy shooting, easy interface, user friendly in-game settings, challenging modes."
21004,"I am really liking this. Its like a very nice updated cs go. If your use to those controls, you will find this game ez getting use to. Although there are somethings you need to learn like how far away you can be from the bomb or how fast you can defuse :) . Its a good game and is free. So give it a shot"

21006,Fps Is such garbage i hold right click and its fine but as soon as i let go the shit hits the fan and i get a middle school powerpoint. Very bad but i understand it is pre beta. it is fun would be more fun without shitty fps drops.
21007,this game is fun but the stupied Ping is more then redicilous if only the devs would make a dedicated Australian Server but no obiously never going to happen coz weve asked in the official discord server amd i know people that have asked in the forums to only be ignoured or banned bye the devs and or moderators becouse they cant take the bad reviews and fix it.
21008,thumbs up!
21009,Generic fps...boring.
21010,Interesting game. Needs a lot of work though....

21012,"Heres an actual review rather than saying ""oh, it works on my potato laptop"" or ""I expected p2w on this f2p fps but it's not"". 

1. You can get kicked by high ping. Lets say around 200.
2. the hipfire its even more accurate like 1 pixel between the center of the crosshair
3. the crosshair expansion when moving is still too small
4. hipfiring in this game is the most accurate thing ever happened among any other FPS even csgo
5. People hack in this game even the game uses this so-called best anti-cheat
6. this game is made in Korea and we all know Asians can be the smartest in hacking (so which makes them bypassing american anti-cheats)
7. Help me add more negative reviews because american devs are so much better
8. I prefer CSGO than this game
9. Hitreg is terrible
10. Hitboxes are shit like when csgo had to patched theirs
11. Bullets travel too slow
12. who ever does more damage per headshot wins
13. csgo is worth its price for what they have"
21013,"not as good as i thought, other free FPS games have better specs than  this game."
21014,"Can I get refund of my life for trying this game for FREE
UN-INSTALL
Play it if you like PS1 quality games  ""might have been a hit 20 years ago"""
21015,"are there any real players in this, or it's just AI bots?"
21016,"Garbage, no one plays for objective in destruction and TDM is a joke where enemy is easy as bots and search and destroy is a clear rip off of csgo but even shittier."
21017,This is a great free to play game Ive been playing since the alpha and I have to say they add alot more content then overwatch and IT IS NOT A COPY. I suggest this free to play game to anybody
21018,....
21019,"Cheaters need to be booted from the game, will not play until sorted."
21020,tac reload.
21021,"A very average FPS game, no skill is needed to get the highest score.
But its okay I guess."
21022,"Very great game, awesome to snipe!"
21023,no voice comms and reminiscent to getting noob tubed across the map in call of duty 4.
21024,"It may not be special, but it's fun which is all that counts."
21025,"Black Squad is a decent game. It doesn't have anything that special about it but it is free to play so whatever. I would recommend this game, but if you have CS:GO or some other game, just play that."
21026,CSGO/COD crossover but good
21027,fuuuuuuun love this game
21028,Its Good Shooter Game If You Like Cs Go You Will Like This Game You Should Buy It
21029,"Got a high ping because i play at SEA, but I can still play  smoothly. I just dont like the latest update that the system auto kick all player with 200+ ping. From that update im sure this game have lost a lot of players. I do not recommend this game on sea, this game has a one sided management."
21030,"Very first day was fun! The day after that, my aiming sensitivity just went down astronmically. Re-adjusting the sensitivity doesnt do anything other than relaunching the game after every single match. I am very displeased and aggravated."
21031,"10 hoolidelies out of 10 hoolidelies                

-FLOWEY"
21032,"Game was  extremely fun ,unti the latest latency and bug fixed update.Its like Counter strike and call of duty.Played the game alot .COuldn't get enought of it until the update and everything went to shit."
21033,"Game feels kinda clunky, sound effects are almost comical.   
bullet travel time is so slow that guns just feels very unresponsive."
21034,Roblox wannabe of a game
21035,"Go f**k yourself,stupid game
Just been kick in loop due to too high ping
And I can't join any game in NA or SA servers"
21036,A very good potential game! It has good graphics and quality of gameplay. The aiming system movement needs to be a bit faster. The range of the grenades also need to be upgraded including some physics behind it.
21037,Why dont have Asia server?
21038,"Im putting as much effort as it takes to get a kill into the following bit of the review.
."
21039,"A classic fun, free, polished and optimized run n gun fps game. You can't go wrong with trying this game if you want a fast paced action based shooter. May not be the greatest one ive played, but it sure is fun."
21040,this game is about like an copy to csgo but it is free u cant talk to communicate but if you cant buy csgo you should get started with this until you can buy csgo.You guys i recommend this game
21041,the some gun need a nerf then the game will be very good
21042,"even if its free it gets very stale within a matter of 2-3 games, the ""free to play"" game is free, but some weapons you need to either spend absurd amount of time to get, or simply spend real money"
21043,"Hello i really liked the game played it for so long now, im addicted xD. But after your last patch, i always join servers that give me high ping. When i started the game i have no ping issues i was running at 120 to 140 ping or sometimes lower, but when the patch have been released my ping has been 280 to 340 to every server i join into, by that i always get kicked and cant play a single game. Please help, im looking forward on playing your game alot in the future :D."
21044,++
21045,:/ THANK FOR THE UPDATE FUCK UP MY SETTING N MY SENSITIVITY
21046,"Pros: The game is good, not PAY TO WIN
Cons: lack of servers like SEA server"
21047,"Finally there is a Asia server, now this game is perfect for me! 

Great game with Good server, so why not try it out if it suits you..."
21048,"The game is so good and the weapon balancing is done well that even the first weapon you get is enough that you wont need to buy other guns.
"
21049,Takes over a second of constantly hitting the enemy to kill them.  If you like bullet sponges than have fun.
21050,"great game for a gamer who has only played fps games on a console, i recommend black squad for a beginner to pc fps games"
21051,"Pretty good fast paced gameplay, a bit like COD with relativly small maps mostly such as Shipment or Nuketown, but it is pretty good. It is well optimized and can run at highest settings on a GTS360 card with 1GB of vram. I would recremmend this game to anyone who is new to steam and is looking for games for free or anyone who wants to try out the FPS genre on their gaming pc. Note that this game could potentionally run on low end hardware such as a normal HP family system."
21052,"Great F2P FPS game, f2p while not being pay to win. Everything can be unlocked with ingame currency. Weapon skins can be purchased for real money (bullets), but stats for the weapon do not change. It is purely cosmetic. The net code in this game is amazing and the DEVs actually care about the game. 

There are frequent patches and the DEVs will have a patch stream letting you know what will be in the patch before it happens. The DEVs also actively listen and talk to the community. 

Here's a montage of some blacksquad gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhOzjoqM-Iw"
21053,"its good could be better with a few things changed but other then some things that are REALLY stupid its a good game

pros.
1 its not csgo its more fun then csgo
2 its not cod its less 12yearold infested then cod
3 its not battlefield its faster then battlefield
4 its not argo its WAY better then argo in EVERY way

cons
1 north american servers do not have a ping limit and playing vs players that have beyond 200ping is REALLY annoying
2 the glock is stupid op accurate its a lazerbeam its a 4-5shot kill and it out damages most other guns in the game
3 the recoil on some guns is so bad they are unuseable for real example the ak12/ak47 mk14 all really powerfull rifles 2 of which have grenade launchers but the recoil on them is insane even when u ads(aim down sight) the recoil is really high and not easy to use where as other guns like the tar21 lazerbeam no recoil can melt thru enemys that needs to be changed so the aks and mk can be used easyer lowering the recoil will help so much they are very powerful but power means nothing if its unuseable
4 the maps are not very good some of them literaly feel like a copy and past of half a map like the map storage its like 100m wide 200m long a few shiping containers in the way a few boxes in places and thats bout it where some like dustshield feels like a good map like the made it all not just copy and pasted half of it

overall

its fun id recomend it it gets stupidly annoying but it can be very fun and funny there are hackers tho sadly and necause its a free to playgame the anticheat is not the best of the best they use battle eye which is a 6 out of 10 on the crap scale on arma3 from what ive seen its sad really hacking scum ruin everything"
21054,"tac reload

it's pretty plain, but as far as f2ps go, you can spend your time in worse ways for sure"
21055,Pretty nice!
21056,maybe ther are hackers in this game but i love this game
21057,the game is great needs a little more work but thats y its on early access so ya give it a try.
21058,This is the best fps shooter that i have found on steam
21059,Love this game!
21060,dont. play. this. game.
21061,"The game is fun, its like a cheap boys CoD.
game has some fun gameplay elements aswell, but u wouldnt play over dirty bomb, cs go and tf2.
but i do have 1 problem, thier are new asia servers, because i live in australia i have to join europe servers, but i get kick. it would be great if you had an asia server.

7/10"
21062,"This game is far batter then stupid warface,and i strongly recommend this game for all fps lovers.but its all about depend on NS STUDIO, How long they can control to stop hacking."
21063,good game
21064,Nice game!
21065,What i will say is : What A NICE GAMMEEEEE
21066,The game is fun but needs some work to many shootin through things that you shouln't be able to and to many times have shot someone multple time in head an chest an then whem they 1 shot me out of the blue instead of dying.
21067,"Even for a free to play game - its bad.

Even with GTX 1060 i could not get constant fps.
The overall movement of chars is horrible.
Game feels like fps made in 2008s."
21068,"Autobalancing system is extremely bad (or non existent), you'll find yourself playing 8 rounds in a 3v5.

Inability to modify weapons/attachments etc.

Decent game nonetheless."
21069,"Fun little game, good game modes, the maps are decent. Generic to the genere but still fun to play."
21070,"This game was an amazing experience for the first few hours. The tutorial is complete garbage. Once you get past it and get to the meat of the game in the 5v5 demolition, it really starts to shine. The most unfortunate thing about the game though which you will quickly realize, is the excessive amount of hackers that are in the game. I understand the developers have this title in early access, but the ease of hacking into the game for aimlocking and walling is unacceptable. If the developers work on a better anti-cheat system and purge the game of hackers with a system similar to CS GO Prime, my opinion for the game may change. As it stands though, this is an attractive potentally great shooter to be avoided until it's fixed."
21071,"EDIT: Finaly able to play now great game no dubt 
10/10 worth it"
21072,it`s a verry bad game.
21073,"Well this was a colossal disappointment.

It feels like a shiny new Combat Arms without the P2W aspect (YET, I noticed several ""premium"" looking currencies in the game) with a VERY small selection of weapons (from a level 1 standpoint) and it seems a large cheater pool.

I frequently noticed people would shoot me before i can even see them from around a corner and its always a one shot headshot. I'm fairly skilled at FPS games and though I could pick up kills easier than Combat Arms thanks to a better weapon system, everything felt just as clunky as CA.

Netcode was an issue, it felt the same as CA, and I have quite a few hours in CA to know whats up.

Teamplay is non-existant and an overwhelming number of cheaters forced me to quit early.

Do not recommend. Don't waste your time."
21074,Aim bots and pay to win.
21075,its pretty good for a free game
21076,"Have to equip knife to sprint? You are still carrying the same gear when your knife is equiped, but you are quicker?
FIX THIS?!?!?!"
21077,this game requires no skill
21078,Can't see your legs.
21079,"WOW i didn't expect it to deliver....
it's MW2 all over again."
21080,Better than CSGO
21081,Ey i like this game but the new update kills the joy >:( it kicks me out whenever i play a match in Europe server due to my high ping. Please intergrate a server in SEA so people there could play :)
21082,"The game is great, I absolutely love it. I'm just hoping you guys can reduce the recoil of the mk14 mod1 its super high for a gun that costs that much and takes away its effectivness"
21083,Pls! Bring back the old sensitivity setting. And fix the auto balance system too.
21084,"I love this game so much.
The graphics, the smooth gameplay (40/50/60 etc. Frames per second and its constant)

The players are competetive and this game reminds me of CSGO and Modern Warfare and so on.

To be honest, my one true fear about this game that, even tho it states in the description, that it will become a Pay To Win game, as alot of the good Free to Play games have.

Keep up the good work, can't wait to see this game released entirely and in it's full glory, definitely recommended"
21085,f2p
21086,Can you add Thompson with a drummag and M1 Garand and add WW2 characters pls :)
21087,"I do not expect a lot from a free to play game, but what I hate is the fact that it is similar to Line Of Sight. Small arenas, also kills can be easily made. The graphics are not very good."
21088,"I can't even play it because of the insane ping I get, they need more servers in more places!!! Other than that a really fun game. If you can get more servers set up for people in different places, it would allow more people to play!!! I really want to like this game, however it does not seem like I can."
21089,"Fun! I have CS:GO and I played it but I must say this is much more fun at the start or for inexperienced players than CS, also I love the game modes, and the looks, you can see it's a new game."
21090,Bland copycat cookie cutter shooter with wonky gameplay and UI. Hard sell even when free.
21091,nEW uPDATE rUINED gAEM. rESET aLL sENSITIVITIES. aRE yOU oK rEATARD?
21092,What a avesome game.... Till patch 5. The ping cap. Yes i know its frustrating that sometimes people cant be hit when you shoot them but goes both ways... anyway the reason that i dont like the ping cap is purely coz there is no servers for this gam (any many others) so my ping is alwats so HIGH that it reaches 220. But yeah now i cant play this game and makes me sad. Well over to the next i guess
21093,It's very fun. One of the better Free 2 Play games I have played in my time. It is not P2W whatsoever which is absolutely fantastic due to the fact that most F2P games are currently pay to win. I would certainly recommend trying Black Squad out.
21094,"On one hand, it's a free to play game, what more can you expect? The biggest reason I'm putting this review up is they say absolutely NO pay to win. But there's definitely a pay to win mechanic here. I've gotten my hands on some of the higher level guns and I'm tellin you they are so much better than the junk you have access to early in game. So how do you get them?

Well technically you can't just buy them outright. So if you call that not pay to win, then sure it isn't pay to win. But in reality they have these stupid random boxes that let you get random loot that you spend real money on. You can get better guns out of those. That sounds like pay to win to me. 

Also, you can just pay to get double xp and double gold, thus speeding along your progress to the next set of medals or whatever to get your next big gun. I don't know what planet you're from, but to me that's pay to win for sure. The only defense you could say to this is I guess skill does have something to do with it too. Just because you have an awesome rifle doesn't mean you'll win the firefight. But odds are if your shot is as good as theirs you win the firefight every time with a better gun. Not to mention BS things like grenade launchers attached to better weapons. Assault rifle will lose to grenade launcher every time. So yeah, I'm calling it pay 2 win. And for that I think it's just $hit that they decided to call it not pay to win.

What they should've done is taken the high road like league of legends or whatever. Not a pay to win game, but all cosmetics can be purchased. Then it would've made a lot more sense. Shame on those liars, if you're asking me. But then, who is?"
21095,nice game
21096,"It's okay.

The gameplay is generally quick-paced and requires little skill to play. Maps are either too open or too narrow (imo). Gun selection is.. just a lot. Some of them are just skins for the guns, which I don't know what the benefit is to it. As a f2p game, it's alright. They should release more maps, I might just keep looking into this game as it progresses."
21097,"The Game over all is alot of fun. There seem to be elements of Battlefield, Call of Duty, and CS. The hit scan seems to favour the shooter as there were times when i had been behind cover for a couple seconds then died to someone who when i checked the scoreboard had 300 ping. havent played too much yet but like it advertises there isn't really pay to win. The in game currency isn't supper hard to obtain as you can easily get 1000 in one game with guns costing between 90k and 200k. the game starts you off with 200k so you can buy a gun or to you think you might like."
21098,"Very competent, nothing special.

Black Squad doesn't seem all that original compared to other shooters, but I'm not sure it was trying to be. Certainly it isn't going after new-to-the-genre players, as the tutorial/training modes could only be called inadequate for actual training. 

There are both quick-respawn deathmatch and team-based objective missions, but most players gravitate to deathmatch for quick play so they don't have to spend most of the time spectating. The added classes of Destruction mode may indeed be the deepest aspect of the game, but they are hard to experiment with since they aren't available in training and can't be switched mid-match. This is something I hope NS Studio adds to practice mode (at minimum), because I think it might hook people if it wasn't so inscrutable.

Overall if you really like PvP shooters and want to try a different take, you'll find Black Squad competent and even prefer it to competitors. But if you're looking for something that innovates on the traditional shooter, I can't say this is it. It's exactly as fun as other games in the FPS genre; no worse, no better."
21099,"For a free to play game, it's actually pretty good. This game isn't pay 2 win like most games, your default weapons are good, and when you want to purchase a new weapon, it stays forever, hopefully this doesnt change. I can't say much more since I only played for a few minutes. but I would recommend checking it out if you like shooters."
21100,Decent game i suppose.
21101,"Good game! Very solid f2p FPS, gives me something to do now that I quit CS. If ur looking for a great time filler and got tired of playing CS for 10 years this is really good."
21102,"Nice game! Has amazing visuals, detailed maps, multiple guns and much more! Definately recommended."
21103,Store brand Call of Duty. It seems to belong on a cellphone. played the begining party. basic controls dumb AI. Not going to try the multiplayer.
21104,nice game i loved
21105,Just get Combat Arms
21106,Nikdy viac tento trash pojebany
21107,"this game is pretty good considering it being a free to play game, it does take alot of the aspects from other games but its pretty good. although the maps could be tons better, very small but very hard to keep a position and not die 20 times. more game modes should be added aswell something along the lines of deathrun would be really cool."
21108,"I bought a Ak12 box thinking it would give me a gun, 10,000 gold, and 100 or 25 medals but it didnt I spent a $1 on a free game just to get 25 medals that I can get from completing a weekly mission such bullshit its a scam never told me that I would only recive one item. This is a very fun game but dont ever buy anything they are rip offs, I spent a fucking $1 for 25 medals thats stupid asf I want my refund wtf no wonder they dont tell you what you get fucking bullshit"
21109,"If you have a low spec laptop or PC,then this is game for you! Its not like every other F2P game on steam..a fact that it is not pay-to-win makes this game even better! I still have so much fun playing this.Movement is very annoying to control when you are shooting at someone in very close range.Sniper is not hard to control,even though sensitivity can make it sometimes harder for you to shoot someone.But I can garantue you a lot of fun if you are fan of a FPS games."
21110,"Terible game feels like a copy of others. The fact that it is free is ok but there IS NO AUSTRALIAN SERVERS! DONT KICK PEOPLE FOR PING WHEN YOU DO NOT GIVE AN OPTION. AMERICA DOES NOT NEED TWO SERVERS YOU CAN MANAGE YOULL GET MORE POPULATION IF YOU PROVIDE IT TO OTHER PEOPLE!
People=Money
"
21111,xD
21112,"full of hacker, this game is dogshit"
21113,"This game is fun. This game is better than counter strike global offensive. This game has potential.I love the game and gameplay.I would recommend improving some of the front menu for less lag and get better and bigger server but the game is beautiful and I want to see the game grow.This gameplay is smooth. I can run with a nvidia gt 710 2Gb on high with 34-54 frames per second. Make the server better/bigger,fix homescreen lag in some areas and you will have solid gameplay. Also in the tutorial the mouse sensitivity is too low when you begin so make the tutorial sensitivity on half.I hope you read this and plz keep up with the good work. This game is worth everyone's time.Developer do this I guarantee you this will be a top fps shooter and well known one.Thank you."
21114,love the game its awsome
21115,great
21116,from what ive played this game is not much difrent from the others but its a nice lil game that every one can enjoy
21117,"good servers
"
21118,"Probably the Best F2P FPS out on the market right now in EA. 

Pros:

- no Pay2Win
- Good mixture between CS and CoD
- Clan system
- Clan Wars
- Clan Ranking 
- Clan Server, Custom Room Server, Quickmatch Server and a Competetive Server for each 
  Region
- Good amount of game modes
- Search and Destroy ( aka Destruction) is probably the best to play if you are looking for skilled 
  play.
- Skin system (the only way to pay real money for something)
- Most skins do like very nice
- Movement is smooth
- Gun play is relativly easy to learn but hard to master
- Possibily to switch on and off your silencer and laser during a match on most guns
- Great Perfomance, you can run it on cheap/old hardware or with a NASA PC
- Graphics are nice 
- Destruction Maps are well designed
- non toxic community

Cons:
(this review is written during EA, so somethings might get improved or fixed in the mean time)

- too much Explosive Spam (Technically each player could have 1x Nade and 2x GL)
- No Crouch Spamming block
- ATM most patches are just new skins or cosmetics
- the game already exists in KOR for a while and here on the western market it is still in EA
- Clan matchmaking isn't fair. Most clans drop their points to play against low rank clans
- General MM isn't that great
- No weapon Customization (Scopes are already premounted on most weapons)
- Most TDM maps are bad and just mirrored 

TO BE CONTINUED

If you are looking for alternatives to Counter Strike, Warface or Combat Arms you should definitly give this game a try.

ded game"
21119,"This game causes rage beyond belief, if you want to play a shooter game spend £10 on CSGO £25 for Siege, dont cheap out on this weak excuse for a tactical shooter!"
21120,"What an awesome free to play title I give this a 5 star rating man its a boomer of a game I love it
"
21121,"The skill curve doesnt exist. Literally, the tutorial is as difficult as the game gets. If you want a game with any sense of skill or achievment, go play dirty bomb."
21122,"It's a fun game very similar to CSGO and COD, if you can get CSGO go ahead and do that but this game is really fun too"
21123,"it makes Call of Duty look like an amazing game.

without question, the worst FPS game I have ever played. if you like braindead shooters, this is for you.

no aim required. held LMB and prefired every corner, got at least 3 frags each time. blindly hold LMB at any corner, enjoy your free kills. jump shooting choke points, free kills. not even worth playing."
21124,still better than call of duty 7/10 would recommend
21125,Very good free to play game i recomend it if you like cod ect.
21126,"We Need Malaysia flag card, Thailand and Singapore got their own flag card but why no malaysia

anyway, the gameplay seems very interesting and make me keep playing non-stop

it would be 5/5, but i give 4.5 for not having Malaysia Flag Card

[UPDATE]

They got added!"
21127,I played since beta.Its okay.
21128,This Game Was Fine But When they add It The High ping feature ..
21129,doesn't let me PLAYYY i have like alot of ppl a ANTI-CHEAT error and its crashes my game tried everything cant fix it :(
21130,"I normally never post a comment on games, but this game is so fun and VERY competetive, it been a long time since i played a game with so good input lag and responsive movement, Very awesome game, i recommend it!"
21131,"PLEASE READ*****

This game is totally amazing, it plays well and get high fps on potato pc's. But 2 things that I think should be added into the gameplay and into the actions of the characters are:

1) Strafing/moving the gun diagonally left and right to look around corners.
2) Crawling/Lying on the ground.

This would improve the fun of the game entering into a hide and seek availability aswell."
21132,"Very bad gunplay, terrible sounds, unballanced weapons, small maps, pay2win, full of cheaters, laggy servers. Just another free2play piece of shit."
21133,A
21134,"Great game :^)

Failed to load game data"
21135,"Actually it was a great game but there's no asia server so every time I play on europe server it will suddenly kick me cuz of high ping even my ping was just 150
"
21136," this is good ! 
"
21137,"Extremely Good

Good Settings , even a toaster would run this game
Nice Gameplay
10/10, worth playing."
21138,This is game is just awesome.
21139,-_-
21140,"I HATE THIS GAME! Sucks crap. + swering, is boaring, and for some reason I couldnt figure out how to get on a game. WASTE OF TIME DON'T GET."
21141,"Ok. Its a free to play game and it has a very high fps. But there are a lot of problems. 
1)They tryed to make a full realistic game but the sights are ratarded.
2)the game is unfair, because at first place a new player has shit weapons and cant kill anyone. And you cant kill anyone of higher ranks because they have the best weapons in the game and the best armors.
3)Camping. Everyone has camped at least once at this game, even me who i hate camping, so if you like camping that definetly your game!
4)Shit matchmaking. I havent played this game so much but i can understand that i am palying sometimes with palyers from the higher rank of the game.
5)Weapons. The weapons are simply unfair. You have to play a couple of hours to get a new, better weapon.

CANCER WARNING; This is a view of an idiot newbie and not the point of view of an expert of this game.."
21142,The game is very fun to play and has lots of potential.
21143,.................
21144,Very good game im gonna keep it playing
21145,"Really fun mix between battlefield, cod and csgo"
21146,This is not a bad game but DONT GET IT IF YOUR SOUTH AFRICAN YOU ARE WAISTING YOUR TIME you get kicked for ping being to high and there is no SA server`s so dont download it at all
21147,"has potential , just hope this doesnt becoma zula , shooting needs to be improved ,  and servers lag , optimization is bad also EDIT: iafter 2 months i dont think this game will fix , it just gets worse , it doesnt deserve u playing it , becoming cashgrab with no skill involved, no recoil guns, maps are garbage with no tactical element etc"
21148,Its a very nice free to play shooter game
21149,I nominate this game with category labor of love because i think the developers have worked hard on this game and still working and trying to make it better and bigger i really hope this game can win this prise
21150,you dont see bs like this everyday
21151,GIVE ASIAN SERVER
21152,it crashes to much
21153,Lika
21154,"This is the best best FPS game i ever played even better then CS GO for free but it lacks many resources like  maps with different gameplays, guns, workshop and other minor improvements like Achievement ( Now Done) and Steam card and i think that it should be a paid game and not for free.
8 stars for this game and 2 stars more if they improve it and not become greedy like CS GO.

21155,"Good game. So far its not a P2W at all. Fast paced, good graphics and free. What else you can ask for?

UPDATE:
After playing more I must say that this is simply a great game. I tried some FPS in the past couple years, but I have not enjoyed anything like this since TF2. It is very fast paced and still not a pay to win at all. You can buy pretty much all the guns with the in-game money you earn and there is no superior gun. I still use the default weapon in most of the cases.

At this point you just sign up for a game and you can't select the map you'd like to play on. Finding a match is really quick, in most cases it happens in about 10-15 seconds, and never took more than a minute.

Well done developers, I hope this game will gain more popularity."
21156,Very cool free game!
21157,good
21158,It could be better than this!
21159,"I'll leave my original post underneath. Came back after a long time and seems they are making a good effort at making the game better. Better team balance and haven""t had any issues with hackers. Some good new maps to play. Would recommened to give it a go and see what you think.
Very good game, one of my favourites, I have 200hrs, but very bad company, lot of cheaters at times. Getting kicked from rooms that a cheater is the moderator and he can turn off the player balance system to suit himself and his team, e.g. game I played tonight had 5 more players on the other team, this will kill your stats! Some great players, lot better than me, but games are not balanced and it can end up a wipe out! Each team should have the same, these are the awesome games you can have rarely that are so close your hands sweat by the end, but doesn't happen often. Lot of abuse from players in the forums, and the same people in the forums at times, abuse too people that are just trying to have a good game experience, and the forums are controlled from people from the game. They will delete posts if they don't like what has been said, as what has happened to me in posts I have commented on. Loosing  purchases before the ones you already have bought have timed out due to updates, meaning every time this happens you have to re-purchase again. Ping times getting worse on some servers, one server has gone from 200ms to over 500ms at times. A real dissapointment for how big this game could have been. Read the the forums before choosing whether to buy or not."
21160,"yeeeeee

21161,When koreans make a better CS than Valve 10/10
21162,good gaem gg
21163,"This game is legit just a more modern version of Combat Arms. It follows every F2P shooter model that for some reason is pumped out of South Korea and I can only assume this one is backed by Nexon too. It's a fairly basic FPS, it has a really lame over the top cinematic tutorial that tries to make the game way more cooler then it is but fails at even being cool and is just annoying. 


Seriously though it has pretty much the same menu as Combat Arms, and has the same business model where you ""rent guns"". For some reason though as far as I can tell you can buy every gun permanent for free, you don't really have to rent the guns, you can just save up until you can buy them perma. Which makes me wonder why you even have the option to rent. Only explanation I have is that the shop is the one from Combat Arms, because like I mentioned it's almost the exact same menu. Which would explain the rental option despite the business model currently not being geared towards you paying for permanent equipment.



Overall this game is Combat Arms, if you want to see what the games business model will be like in the future look at Combat Arms because that is what this game is. This was obviously some attempt to take that game, put a new coat of paint on it, and rake in a few more years worth of revenue."
21164,"BEST GAME EVER BUT I CANT PLAY IT BECAUSE IT SAYS ""Blocked of the file""
THEN GIVES ME A 0xc000009a error or something like 0xc00009a 
IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS PLEASE MESSAGE ME!OR GO TO MY YT CHANNEL AND MESSAGE ME

21165,"its a F2P FPS so i went in not expecting much, but with the way i played it just seemed to be a braindead run in and shoot them and hope they dont shoot first, if you dont take it seriously and you just run around and murder people its pretty fun, i enjoyed my time with it"
21166,"Enter Europe server with 220ms and get kicked for having a high ping
BUT
Enter South/north american server with 280-500 ms allow me to play with shitty lag.
SERVER FOR MALAYSIA PLEASE"
21167,The game should have an Asia sever
21168,"Early Access and the game already has aimbotters going 50 - 0 with a 100% accuracy margin and 100% headshot margin on their stats. 

Your game is already worthless, there is no report button"
21169,"Solid Shooter, nothing really innovative about it, if you've played a f2p shooter you know what to expect.

Execution is solid, fun gameplay, tight controls and an overall good experience. 

Maps are small, kill times low and respawn times lower make for fast paced combat reliant on quick reflex's and a good aim.

Microtransactions are cosmetic only, no one weapon is overpowered in my experience. 200k gold right at the start (2 or so weapons perma unlocked depending on what you purchase)

Hopefully it gains some traction and the dev team rolls out new content to keep the player base happy."
21170,Hackers and Hackers and Hackers
21171,"Released a month ago and there are already plenty of cheaters. The plus side to this game is that there is no Pay-To-Win, it's an even playing field until cheaters enter the game. Also, their anti cheat cannot detect the actual cheaters but it can disconnect my teammates during a match.

Fix it."
21172,CAncer game ever
21173,"Broken, Installed over tether (took a few hours at that) finally got the game installed ate up 3/4th of my internet for the month (which would be fine IF it worked but no. I repeatedly get a error on load up of game ""NOTICE Invalid approach [5] [8] CONFIRM"" game instantly crashes afterwords. Read thru the forums for help (multiple threads about it with 0 mention from the devs) no fixes went online watched a few videos and nothing that worked.

I would not recommend a game that is broken and can not even launch to anyone under any circumstanse. Maybe one day if they fix the game instead of ignoring the problem existence.

After a dozen or more tries I've not even got this game to load to the menus... When trying to leave a review it wouldn't let me saying ""You need to have at least 5 mins of in game time to leave a review"". I honestly wonder how many people have this problem who can't even let others know since they can't get the game to load to get to the 5 min mark. 

I simply window tabbed out of the game with the error message up just to get a few mins of useage to leave this review."
21174,Will not recommended this filthy money sucking games full of cheaters.
21175,You can practice your skills before you play csgo
21176,"This game plays very well, similar to CSGO but alot easier, However it suffers from poor map design which makes it extreemly easy to spawn trap. Most maps are atleast 2 lanes and a square box. More creative and complex maps and this game might be a decent game."
21177,"i didnt like this game. to me it didnt have good gameplay. also u have to buy tjings with in game currency, so that was a downside"
21178,"I am actually loving this game and I can't believe for my first game, I got pretty lot of damn kills for the first time. I don't want to compare any game like COD or CS:GO in this (because who would?) and I will tell you about my experience playing this game.

1. When you play the game and finish the match, it will not give you too much coins at the end (unless you getting a LOT of kills)
2. There is no rent feature when purchasing the gun. So the developers made a DLC weapons for 15 days to try which guns are suitable for your.

My conclusion for this game, try this game out and let the judge be with you. IT'S FREE and PROMISING LOOKING."
21179,One of the best free to play games i ever played
21180,"So downloaded this game..

its enjoyable to an extent. Its basically CS:GO for free and no recoil on your guns. 

The TDM and WAR aspect are great fun but very repetative. The skill level gap is massive between the good and the average. The average are bad...then the good are super good almost hacking like... Headshot after headshot. 

Good for a few hours quickly becomes boring."
21181,rly good game :)
21182,COOL GAME
21183,"I can not say that this is a game worth trying when there is an abundance of free-to-play games with much better graphics, gameplay and sound, even for variety it aint really worth the download, there are plenty UE3 game engine using games that are much better...

Pros :
 - none that I saw really, perhaps the abundance of choice in its gui, or that you spawn immediately with zero delay.

Cons: 
 - Gameplay is extremly slow in comparison to games like Warframe, Dirty Bomb, Warface...
 - Graphics are dated and bad. (dated as in CS style)
 - Sound is dated (yep I'm saying that.. this is the 2nd game this year aiming for buzzer sounds (pre-soundcard era))
"
21184,"The game doesnt even start.

I have verified files, uninstalled, reinstalled, verified files again, uninstalled, reinstalled, verified it again, and I'm now permanently uninstalling it (at least that button works)."
21185,Pls make a report menu. cause someone used hack and Trash talk to team.
21186,"In my limited time playing Black Squad, it has a lot of potential to be a great game, so here are a list of good and things they can improve
Pros
- It's not a Pay2Win game. A lot of F2P games allow you to buy better weapons leaving the guys who don't want to spend money at a huge disadvantage. This game is spot on towards competing without disadvantages towards those who don't spend money on ingame items. There are skins and such to buy ingame but does not give advantages to anyone else.
- Sounds are really good, the footsteps are loud so sneaking around is usually the best way to go
Battle (Gamemode) is a very intense and fun gamemode to play
- Most guns are pretty balanced
- Demolition (Gamemode) is really fun 
- It's Free to Play

Things to improve
- The Blazer (sniper rifle) is really overpowered in that it's mobility is really high for a one-shot kill. If they reduced movement speed and make it more of a stationary weapon rather than a run and gun one-shot kill then I think that would balance it
- When observing (dead/spectating) teammates, it's hard to tell which is a teammate and which is an enemy. I suggest putting a highlight over teammates much like in CSGO so people know who's an enemy and who's not. Also keeping the minimap up while observing would be beneficial for players that use 3rd party communication services (discord, mumble, teamspeak) to help make callouts to teammates 
- In Demolition (gamemode) Bomb timer is 40 seconds and the defuse is 7 seconds. The maps are fairly large and as a Peacemaker (defender) will take a while to clear areas and get to the bomb to defuse. The percentage of winning a round as a peacemaker, especially when stuck at a disadvantage (1v2) and on the other side of the map, is really low. If they increase the timer to say 50 or 60 seconds it would still be competitive and give the Peacemakers a chance to win the round. Either increase the bomb timer or decrease defusal/plant time.
- Would like to see some more gamemodes (maybe Capture the Flag, etc)
- Obviously this is still early access but with time I'd like to see more weapons and cooler, more aesthetically pleasing animations when inspecting weapons
- Not too big a deal, but adding in-game microphone would be beneficial when playing gamemodes such as demolition where communication is key
- Map design is good not great, basic map styles. Some have too many openings it's hard as a Peacemaker to navigate where the enemies are. Keeping it simple will make the game flow much better
Overall this is a fun game that I hope will continue to update and get better."
21187,"Buggy, full of lag, terribly made, graphics borrowed from 2005. Overall boring, unplayable and terrible.
"
21188,"Best Free To Play FPS Game EVER!,If U Play CSGO Or Cod Its Similar But In Free To Play!"
21189,"Mediocre F2P FPS that's basically combining elements of Counter-Strike with mechanics from other FPS games such as Call of Duty or Battlefield. Is it worth the download? Well, it depends on the situation. If you don't have much money to spend on games, then be my guest, but if you already own CoD, BF, or CS:GO, don't bother."
21190,Bad copy paste of CS:GO.
21191,fxxking high pink so kick me?
21192,Good game some cheaters but is ok
21193,"Its not a bad game for a free to play!
graphics are great also the animation is amazing!
but...its clearly still early access...the maps ballance is....mha....at best
some weapons destroy others.
from what i learned the best thing u can get is high rate of fire weapons anything slow and mostly u will be out matched.
in the end a good game but ill wait until tis fully out and NOT play it now.
its not ready yet"
21194,This is a great f2p fps online game. Quality has it but badly needs a SEA Server. It's pretty unfair when your ave ping is 300+ms while the opposing team tops at 100 max.
21195,it's a good free game 9/10
21196,"The game is amazing ,friendly community,graphics are High ,sound is great , love it and currently playing only black squad"
21197,"THIS GAME SOMETIMES KICK ME FOR HIGH PING FOR NO REASON AT ALL
"
21198,Its so shit that alt+f4 doesnt work in it
21199,Kinda feels like a mobile game but its good i guess
21200,The hits feel and sound spongy and the guns don't have the desired effect-to-sound ratio. It's a free-to-play game but you are better off playing Blink or just save up and get the superior CS:GO.
21201,♥♥
21202,"Mechanics are certainly nice great potential to be better then for example cs:go

There are just a few major cons:
- no report system/admins who actually try to keep the player base fair and healthy
- no anti-cheat 
- completely over run by cheaters (cheater haven i geus)

Unless those 3 things change its not worth to play for any one who wants to enjoy fair competition or just general fun play."
21203,"Very interesting game, but it is pretty dang fun! For free this game is worth a shot (4.3GB). I'd have to say this game is better then CS, but then again i'm not very good at CS. =D"
21204,"After trying to play the game again, I wondered if my connection was bad or was it thiers, I tried playing other online games to see if my internet was slow but as it turns out my ping is ok, but when I play this game my ping is 3 times higher either fix your servers or goodluck maintaining a good game with bad servers.

And Did I mentoin how bad battleye is like seriously dont use this program its useless af, it blocked the game's dll I mean how do I play now good luck with trying to run this game."
21205,"I honestly don't think I've found a free game that I've liked.  This is a really big exception.  I'm very glad I decided to get it because it's a friggin blast!! A little interesting in the beginning but once you get how everything works, I could t stop playing it.  Loads of fun.  Did I mention it's free??? Don't think.  Do it.  Get it.  You won't be disappointed!"
21206,nice game and game that dont have hacker.
21207,"Combine the obviously ripped off maps with the failed copy of COD and CSGO mechanics you get this horrific disgrace of a game. Not only is the player base some of the least skilled I have ever experienced the gunplay is so stupidly simple its imposible to have fun killing people without feeling like a scumbag thats abusing how easy the guns are to use. Combine this with sometimes freezing for no reason and constantly spawning without a full mag and finding out that when you reloaded a bullet dissapeared it makes this game quite cringy. They were honest about no pay to win because every gun is so easy to use that there isint any one thats particularly op. Not to mention the default side arm is just as deadly as your main weapon due to the fact that its extremely acurate with a high fire rate, damage, and capacity makes grinding people into the ground even easier. There are so many bugs, glitches, and bad or stolen maps and mechanics that the only difficulty in this game comes with dealing with the game, not the actual people shooting at you."
21208,"Black Squad (previously known as Viper Circle) is a free-to-play, military-themed first-person shooter video game developed by NS Studio through a team assembled around Park Bo-Hyun, a former producer for Alliance of Valiant Arms, at South-Korea-based NS Studio. The game was released to public in 2013 but went through a complete overhaul afterwards, most notably the setting from near-future to military theme with some elements of modern warfare.

Black Squad pits two teams, Viper Circle and Peacemaker, against each other in various game modes and maps that can host up to 20 players and ""large scale"" 32-player matches known as Battle Mode and allows players to call for airstrike and artillery support, based on a special combat skill system. Players can choose from many modern realistic firearms and improve their FPS skills."
21209,very bad its mouse sensetivety is very low the settings doesnt even work
21210,Too many hackers
21211,Easy play but if wanna getting more pro need to use real money to buy the item
21212,This game is actually really fun. Super stoked to see how it develops.
21213,TOO MUCH DELAY- Great ping- 3 tap headshot AK47 not dead- DISCONNECT FROM SERVER
21214,"The fucking amount of taiwanese and chinese people in NA servers is over the roof. Try playing a match with a team full of them and having them fly across your screen because of their 250+ ping. The lack of voip and the run and gun mentality of the game makes it a more of a "" arcade"" shooter to put it at an extreme. The game is fun don't get me wrong but the current state of the game doesn't set it up to succeed in the future."
21215,i have a good grafics card but the game still dosnt let me play what kind of graphics card do i need?
21216,"When i started up the game, the fact that they give you so many credits in the begining, and the tutorial is so straightforward that a narkaleptic gibbon could complete it with ease, made it seem good at first. however, i had many problems with the game within my first few minutes of playing. personaly, my sensitivity for aiming has to be particularly high, and i would think that an FPS would start its settings at a reasonably middle ground point for its tutorials. this was not the case, and i found myself scratching my desk to get my character to turn 90 degrees in any direction. 

the customization for characters is poor, the engine needs work, the guns are too easy to buy and anyone who doesn't notice this will be utterly useless in combat with his/her teammates, and the nicest thing i can say about this game is that its a poor man's Counter Strike. Maybe it gets better as you level up, i wouldnt know, i just stopped trying."
21217,"Having played this for just a little over an hour, I can say it is fun enough to try. 
the real fun comes from stuff like melee-only or sniper-only small maps.

I probably won't play it anymore though as i bought a gun that sucks (for me) and it'd take 30 hours to get another one."
21218,Not Recommended... very tiny maps and unbalanced weaponry. The Enemy will always have the better weapon even if you have the same weapon.
21219,Really fun. Also not pay to win
21220,"Controls are ok, but gun play is too unrealistic.  People use snipers like assault rifles, quick shooting, without any stability concerns. graphics are slightly above average, but  all the weapons feel the same.  If you want a game like this, play Warface, much better."
21221,"It's like Warrock, but worse, if that's even possible. Blasted with annoying music from the start, W+M1, tutorial throws everything in your face without giving you time to think, completely outdated."
21222,wank
21223,"First impressions after an hour is it's pretty bad ass. I'm really glad i tried it. They mention netcode and I think its spot on - the sniping is actually reminicant of Battlefiled 2, meaning, its fun and accurate. 

I haven't figured out if there's rampant aimbotting yet cuz it sort of seems like it on my first day, I will say that. 

I prefer the Battle mode where you destory the other teams control points. 

The 4 classes offer quite varied gameplay and for a free game, I'm stoked. I'll be playing this for a minute, or till I figure out if peeps are hacking or I just gotta get gud :P"
21224,no
21225,Up coming Counter-Strike competitor
21226,"Poor man's cod.

Pros:
Runs well on old hardware.

Cons:
Run and gun
Nades
more nades
more nades in face
"
21227,"Immediately uninstalled as soon as I opened it and the music and sounds were @ 917387db with no way to turn them down... Fuck game companies that do this shit! Whoever is in charge of that aspect needs to be fired, and introduced to the Clintons"
21228,very fun game team death match is very cool!!
21229,Great Graphics
21230,2222
21231,"god  game
"
21232,"Although the gameplay is smooth and it does prevent some inovetive mechanics, some of those are simply bad, I cant say i recommend this game. The graphics are really not very good, the teleporting laggy players make the matches unfair, and the main interface is confusing and not polished."
21233,SoSo :)
21234,"First I thought it would be bad after seeing Psisyn's review but then I had to check it out. Really fun, great mechanics. Needs more customization, or guns."
21235,Good game
21236,"I really want to like it I do, bu it has a couple minor flaws that really kill it in this game. 

The gunplay just isnt balanced. You either run assault rifle ""dominant"" one shot sniper rifle, or heavy mg for spray and pray. Other guns simply get outclassed. 

Designated marksmans have no room in long range at all when an assault rifle can kill across the map will less recoil, and usually aim bot assisted. Yes this game has quite a few hackers, and they're ""Working on it"", believe me it was worse a week ago.

Semi snipers dont stand a chance when a bolt action one hits anywhere on the body and can fire within .5 seconds.

Side arms are a joke, even if by some chance you need to pull one out it'd better be a one hitter.

TLDR:
This game just needs balance, and optimization to anti cheat. Ill come back to it at a later time and follow updates."
21237,Very good
21238,"Runs so great on a potato laptop!!
But we need a asia server"
21239,"We need a ping limit on CW SERVERS, People are abusing it, to get easy wins!, its no fun when you are playing vs ++300pinger the delayed shots are insane! you die 90% when you are already behind a wall!

FIX THIS AND THAN DO THE CLANMARK RACE!!!
+300 ping clan can easy rank up! they are ruining the game!

(but than the +300 cant play on eu server) if you have +300 ping your on the wrong server or you are on a public wifi with alot of traffic!
"
21240,Dont play this game if you live in Asia because they don't have SEA Server yet and your probably gonna get kicked if you join on other servers because of high ping.
21241,"Ok so you heard about this game, you like FPS and you have played many others before and want something new. 

Wellcome to Black Squad, CSGO's and CoD's love child, this game will feel very similar to both however it does have its own identity inside the very crowded fps genre, while not replacing the already stablished IPs, Black Squad shows that its got what it needs to be a propper fps worthy of becoming e-sports. 

It is known that the game was originally released in Korea and is very famous over there, however, this new release has already left the korean's versions boots and has gone on its own path patching the game periodically with new weapons, and slight changes that have already made the game play differently than its korean counterpart. If you are a FPS vet or just like the genre and looking something good to try out, definately play this game, you are not going to regret it.

And now, because i do enjoy making lists, there you have a nice big list of the Pros and the Cons that come with playing this game:

[h1]Pros[/h1]
-Feels like home for Cross-Fire/CSGO players, specially when sniping.
-The only F2P Shooter that isnt P2W.
-Guns are [b]permanent[/b] and you do not have to repair them.
-Fair ammount of maps with significant advantages for both teams.
-Amazing optimization, even a toaster can run this game. Provided you are willing to down the graphics.
-Amazing graphics that can rival some newer titles.
-The sounds are very well-made, you can know which gun was shot and were with precision.
-Custom Matches, allowing you to edit the game's values to your liking, playing pre-made modes like knife only.
-Clan Matches, allows you to set up a team of 5 and match you with other clans
-Quick Matches, a fast way for you to play 1 of the 5 available modes: TDM, Demo 8v8, Demo 5v5, Assasination or Battle Mode.
-New Mechanic called Fatal Shots, which are, FaceShots, allowing almost every weapon the potential to kill in 1 headshot provided the bullet lands in the face.
-Almost every map in the game has these spots for set up granades which are amazing and proof that knowledge can sometimes give you a couple of kills.
-Simple friendlist system.
-Has buttons to tweak mouse sensitivity while ingame.
-Color filters and Contrast settings to ease on the eyes.
-Whisper system remembers who have you whispered and gives you a list after you do /w in chat so you can pick who to whisper.
-Simple and easy to use party system up to 5 party member max (only 4 if you're playing anything besides demo 5v5 or clan matches though).


[h1]Cons[/h1]
-Poor gun balance.
-Half of the Automatic weapons in this game are practically lasers of varying damages.
-The hitreg needs to be revised.
-TDM does not use demo maps.
-On that note, the TDM are completely garbage, statics spawns, too small/open. No cover where there should be cover and viceversa
-Statics spawns for TDM along with poorly made maps means that often you will see some spawn trapping
-No way to buy weapons temporarily, specially annoying since theres no other way to test them and some weapons need some grinding to be adquired.
-Many sights in game (ADS) are misaligned to variable degrees. Beating the purpose of ADSing at all
-No matchmaking system, a lv0 player might be matched against lv20. While the actual number on their level does not really matter towards skill, someone whos fresh started are probably not good enough to give any trouble to high level players who have obviously played for many hours and have developed skills for this game.
-No ping limit as of 28-08-2017 (albeit, its on the testing on the EU servers ATM it hasnt been properly implemented in the other regions nor do we know if its gonna work in the same way and at the same limit which is 200ms atm).
-the netcode highly benefit the high pingers.


I will probably be adding more stuff as the game gets updated but these are just the ones i can think of from the top of my head."
21242,"Pretty good game, its like counterstrike with better graphics. The one gripe i have is the maps are too small but it is a decent free to play shooter."
21243,A+
21244,"Decent F2P shooter, tho there is literally no reason to buy any weapons, the starting one is probably one of the best in the game"
21245,"Probably the worst shooter out there. You should drop money in Battlefield or even COD. This game is boring, and have some of the smallest map in the history. Do not play this game, it is not worth the time and dont event drop a single $ in this... If this is 2017 F2P shooter theres nothing great about it."
21246,"It's trying too hard to be cod, but also trying too hard to be csgo.
The controls are trash and I spent 20 minutes trying to figure them out.
The starting guns are terrible so you'll put in about 2-3 shots before they turn and one shot you because they bought better guns.
It's not bad for a free game, but you might as well skip it.
[u] You run by pressing middle mouse button. [/u]"
21247,"Because fuck anyone that lives outside of Europe or America, right."
21248,Game is greater than CS:GO
21249,s
21250,Great Game :D
21251,"✅Alright graphics and gameplay
✅Rekt noobs With Left Click
(There's some flaws and such but we don't worry about that.)
Thats an 8/10 :)
"
21252,Was sketp about it since its a free FPS but to my surprise i enjoyed it way more than what i thought. Has a feel of Rainbow six siege black ops 2 and csgo. For sure worth the time. Best part is there is zero need to put any money into it and even if you do it gives you no edge on anyone for the most part. Completely fair. 10/10 just needs more content
21253,First i was'nt so sure played so many F2P and always need to buy sbetter stuff . but this game the gamplay is fun and its NOT P2W at all you can totally play for free and have fun :D
21254,"Pick up an SMG run around holding mouse 1. no need to aim just hold down mouse 1 and have your crosshair somehwere in the direction of the enemy and get easy headshot.

Grab an assualt Rifle, shoot the enemy 5 times in the chest as hes running away.....watch enemy turn around spraying with SMG and get a hs.

"
21255,A wannabe csgo that is closer to call of duty but way worse. Not bad but just buy csgo or call of duty. But if you don't have 15 dollars then go for it...
21256,It's good.
21257,"It's CSGO with several spare chromosomes left over from a Call of Duty spinoff. Avoid this dogshit like your life depends on it. Unbalanced PAY TO WIN guns in a first person shooter.



PAY TO WIN. FIRST PERSON SHOOTER."
21258,"its not a pay to win and it's balanced
[spoiler] but i hated playing it	[/spoiler]"
21259,BEST FPS F2P
21260,SOOOOOOOOOO GUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
21261,"No Asia server, fk you devs"
21262,"An f2p cod it's really good, i even spent 10$ on it the problem however are the maps they're so shit but some of the tdm maps are actually good but 9/10 when you're going for a 5v5 you're gonna get a shit map if this game actually might be worth investing hours on, but atm the maps give me a constant headache was it the ct's flanking me 10 seconds into the round.

I should also take about the weps, for some reason there are weps that are just better in every stat than some like the deagle for example it's worse than the glock and the dsr is just a reskined version of the blazer it has 1 more point of damage and is the highest damage dealing weapon in the game i still get hitmarkers like crazy and even my upgraded pistol can't 1 shot them atm this game isn't worth investing hours into but if they rework some weps and rework all of the maps then without a doubt it's a good game."
21263,"A mix between CoD & CS:GO, Black Squad is a game with many flaws, yet has the potential to be a newly spawned masterpiece.
Most games I've joined are either A: Fast paced run and gun team deathmatch, or B: Tactically sound plant bomb and defend it round. Again, CoD & CS:GO.
Other than modes, what hurts Black Squad the most is its graphics, interface, and way players and guns are handled.
Graphics are decent for a free to play, but even at highest settings shadows will be boxy and frame rate crashes will be inevitable.
The game's interface, as in the menu, is a mess. While better than a lot of free to plays, I still got lost my first time playing, not knowing how to leave my inventory and enter a game (btw, servers are called channels and there's only one of each so I see no need to even make you pick the one option you have).
Finally, what was a killer for me was the fact that the default assault rifle is nearly as powerful as the SCAR H, a rifle that you must buy and is supposed to be 3 times as deadly. Since everyone has this rifle, everybody uses it, and games become massacres. Sniper rifles don't solve this, and most of them require 2 shots to the head for a kill, 3 on the body. Finally, everybody looks the same, with the Peacemakers and Viper Circle nearly exact copies of each other, only differentiated with bland colors. While this may not sound important, it greatly affects your ability to respond accordingly when the guy that just popped up could either be friend or foe. By the time you figure it out, you're dead, so making the two factions more unique looking would be a great improvement to the gameplay.

Despite all the problems I have listed, I have hope for this game. I believe that this could be the first step to uniting the fans of tactical strategy and fast paced shooters, two kinds of gamers that have been at war for years, under a single title."
21264,"This game is a mix of cod and csgo. The interesting thing about it is that it works. This game needs more attention and players. If this game is done right and given time. It can outshine CSGO. I forgot to mention that you get good fps(from my experiance so far) only thing is P2W is getting the skins lol, if you can count that as P2W. Everything is earned by playing and ranking up."
21265,"This game is probably the most promising free FPS I've seen as of late. First, I love the promise on no P2W, as that's the main reason I don't play 75% of the free FPSs on Steam. The game gives you a lot of money at the start to buy around 2 or 3 guns and getting the money is very easy. The SFX and music are very well done for a free game, but the graphics could be boosted a bit for the Ultra option. Yes, there are cheaters, but I don't see that as being a fault of the game and it will probably be addressed soon enough. It's very fun, easy to pick up, and the movement is fantastic! The whole middle mouse to switch to knife to run thing is very unique and took no time at all to get used to. Right now my only complaint would be the mouse sensitivity being wonky, as in game it's very slow yet in the menus it's normal. I highly recommend this if you want a free FPS that doesn't make you shell out dollars for the best guns."
21266,cant load in right away
21267,its good game
21268,"this game is relly fun so far












too fun dont screw this up"
21269,"I really liked this game until ""kicked by HIGH PING"" arrived! Alas! it had to end like this! had preety much fun! But only recomended for decetly high speed internet! Not for people who loves playing games through lag and suffering , lol!"
21270,"Game needs work. Add an actual run system, some more characters, more weapons, ect. and the game will be better. It is still fun, just needs improvement but that is why it is in beta. I can't wait to see how it turns out in the future."
21271,"Good game, but currently infested with cheaters.   I don't think nexion has any intention of fixing it either.  literally play  matches where  a single person has 80+ kills everyone else floating around single to bottom double digits.  Would not recommend until they get decent anticheat, and since it's free that Anti-Cheat needs to be  Hardware bans.  ban the serial codes of their gpu, cpu, and rams.   I wouldn't  even  mind  paying a couple  bucks for  the game, even with all the  micro transactions, because  currently caught cheaters can just create a  free account."
21272,"Game is F2p,

For a free game its really awesome
Just chilling shooting people . 
Not hard to understand .
Skill level is pretty low on public servers"
21273,"Another Free-to-Play First Person Shooter...or F2PFPS, as I like to call them. But, truth be told, this actually isn't too bad at the time. It controls well, most of the maps are pretty good, there's a good range of gamemodes, it runs well, there are currently no stat boost weapons (though the skins still need to be bought using real-money-turned-to-currency, in this case Bullets), looks nice, runs well and has an active playerbase already. And you can have your character left-handed, if you like. It's not much, but as someone who IS left-handed it's something I appreciate.

It still has issues like the old spawnkilling problem common to these kinds of games is still here, and we still have the awful ""rectangle map with shipping crates"" map in there, there's a lot of engrish in the text and the voice acting is...limited, and we don't know how long until the P2W and Hackers stuff will start to spill in...but for the moment, it's a pretty fun time.

Oh, and be prepared to hear ""TAC RELOAD!"" a lot. Like, a ton."
21274,"P2W, Don't even bother, if only it was only cosmetics and not the actual guns....."
21275,BEST FREE GAME SINCE 2017
21276,gud
21277,"if you don't have cancer, you will have after this."
21278,"I think this game should disband. 



EDIT: 
Its still bad"
21279,"Pros
[list]
  [*] Has four game modes (five if you consider the holiday game modes).
  [*] No pay-to-win aspect just pay for cosmetics.
  [*] The game gives you a lot of free stuff (Free DLCs, free weapon skin crate, almost 200k in-game currency to buy good weapons and a daily login bonus).
  [*] Every weapon in the game can be bought.
[/list]
Cons
[list]
  [*] A few hackers slip through the battlEye anti-cheat system."
21280,"Recent update now kicks anyone with ping over 200, as a player from South Africa, in most games my ping is between 200-250. Cant get into any games now."
21281,Great game
21282,"Pure trash. Just another Asian-style ""gun rental""  game, with very obvious exploits/glitches abused by the BR and RU players that hang out in the NA servers, alongside TERRIBLE default controls, and ""spawn protection"" which lets you run out of spawn, invincible, and kill other players, while remaining invinicible. Garbage."
21283,!!
21284,"Great lowspec system game, uses unreal engine 3. Fast paced so you can play it when feeling bored."
21285,my girlfriend left me.
21286,tac reload
21287,wull with cheaters dont bother atleast f2p better now
21288,A decent mix of black ops and CS
21289,"Fun game when u need a little break from everything else. And it's free, love free things :D"
21290,Poorly made cod with no weapon balance
21291,"add asian servers pls its literally impossible to play a game for more than 10 seconds without getting kicked from europe
(but this game is good CSGO/10)"
21292,"new opinion ~ now they have asian server , i can play it flawlessly ! great game 10/10 lemon would play again and again !"
21293,"This game is amazing!

After playing this game for a few weeks, I have enjoyed it a lot. This game has got fairly similar maps to Black Ops 2 (e.g. the boat map for Team Death match). For those that are interested in FPS games, this is a great game for you. I have also been playing this game with my friend, we both love it.

For those that want to know what weapons to buy first for a:

Sniper weapon - BLAZER R93 - An awesome weapon for long range.

Shotgun weapon - KSG - Great for enclosed areas.

Assault weapon - Tar and SIZMPX

The only disadvantage about this game is that you have to buy grenades and you cannot keep them forever, depending on the equipment will depend on how long you have access to the equipment, e.g. Grenades last for 1 day and they are then avaliable to buy again after a day.

I would love to see more updates as to what else the team creators will add, good luck to the company who created this game.

Overall, a highly recommended game for all.

"
21294,good game
21295,"Game quite enjoyable but kinda disappointed on their so-called ""dedicated server"" lul. I played with 200-300 ping so yeah, i'm gonna give this an negative for now as it does not have an asia server."
21296,gay
21297,"It's the new Poor Man's Combat Arms, which is already the poor mans FPS."
21298,i got kicked for high ping but no shit i live in Australia and there is no fucking servers close to it. Fix it and this is a great game.
21299,"It is weirdly satesfying with weapon damage and weapon control. I actually enjoyed it. Tho it got this god damn ""freemium"" currency which I fucking despise in f2p games."
21300,good good
21301,only reason i cant give it a positive is there are no oc or even asian servers :(

21303,asia server?
21304,"cant get a better game for free to play, worth trying."
21305,"its really good, but the only downside is no Oceania servers."
21306,"This game is terrible, the maps are one two dimensional it feels like, it also feels like I'm playing on the same map over and over again. The problem with the game is that there is nothing to work for after you complete your events. After playing enough your done. You can just wait till tommorow and get more gold. The game seems unfair and unbalanced. There is no skill to play and on top of that the game is unfair. Fix your problems."
21307,Ever want to play game where your enemy becomes a bullet pincussion as your bullets disapear into them? Well you just found the perfect game.
21308,"The game is fun but the UI is unintuitive as balls, and all of the guns are OP as shit. I would recommend it just because its free to play."
21309,"Do not be fooled by the Positive reviews, this game is crap. The gameplay is so cheap and old feeling its worse than original Counter Strike.
Just go play CS:GO."
21310,Please introduce oceanic servers. Playing on other regions there is no point trying.
21311,"First off, i had experience on FPS games, even F2Ps. Some of them were pretty well. But this game? I had to give it a thumbs down its because, starting off from the pre-update, i can play the game smoothly, but then when the update came, i got some major lag with my internet connection even though it is stable. When i checked i get 300+ ping, and Every game i join i get kicked because of ""High Ping"". And that's too much BS to deal with for me even for other people who wants to play the game but has to play with like 200+ ping. So Black Squad, you had potential but i cant deal with the s**t you are throwing to other players. Start right now by fixing your system and servers, especially right now its still on Early Access."
21312,The gamer itself is awesome but it keeps disconnecting every 3-5 minutes. I can't even get through a full match. Fix this and the game would be awesome
21313,I like FPS games but this one has one major flaw no controler support at all and its totorial is absolute crap
21314,its an awesome FPS except P2W NOOBS! if u wanna enjoy this game just play it stop being such a smartass
21315,Nice game
21316,Good game needs a time to get better i recomend this
21317,fun to play
21318,"Worst game ever. Developers are just gold diggers, no support. Ruining the game day day with update. Before this update my ping was 80 and now its 300. They just promoting their game for money."
21319,"Good free to play model, try not to get confused you can buy guns and grenades with the grey currency.
Currency is arwarded after each match depending on stats
nice gameplay realy fast kinda mix of cod and cs
sound is realy good, foodsteps and distance are good mixed and easy to predict
guns more like in cod so get your self some nice AR with good firerate to get a good start
Menu is a little bit nasty to get in to 
Sadly low Player population so sometimes the ping might get bad

9/10 F2P you did it right :thumbs:"
21320,"
I have to admit that I was skeptical of another KR F2P shooter but this one is different. It plays like something inbetween CS and CoD with a few sprinkles of BF classes in the destruction game mode. I really like that it isn't P2W. From what I can tell everything in this game can be aquired by either one of two currencies.
1)Time
2)Money

Whichever of these is worth it to you gives you the option to grind to earn in game equipment or to support the developers and have instant gratification.

The amount of gold you get per game is minimal but just by logging in daily you get a free 15K gold so it would be hard to argue that you have to purchase the boosters. They are there for your convience. There are also other events to earn medals and gold relatively easily. Medals are used to purchase the best weapons on the game but again it can all be aquired completely free. I like the game enough to support the developers and I am starting to lean towards buying the founders pack. 

This is coming from someone who still thinks $24(the sale price on standard edition) is to much for Rainbow Six Siege lol"
21321,"I really like this game, I find it more enjoyable than CSGO, but since the last update I cannot connect to any games for more than a few seconds before I'm kicked for high ping. Not recommended for players in Southern Africa."
21322,"Graphics look nothing like the video even on max settings -_-
The tutorial wants us to pick up a weapon without showing how to do so (press H if you are here for the answer)
The lobby chat is filled up with strange links and spanish speakers.
4/10
Otherwise it's okay for a F2P game, assuming that it is 3D.
"
21323,"It won't let me play. It just brings up the screen and when it changes to play, I click it, and it will just close.
"
21324,"i think its a fun game
"
21325,my favorite game. not pay to win and very competitive. 9.8/10
21326,"amazing netcode  LMAO sure 
other than that its pretty great game"
21327,"Imagine Call of Duty, if it were developed by Koreans.

TL;DR at bottom.

This game is incredibly well-polished, beautiful, and very fun!
I've got 29 hours logged and I'm definitely not planning on stopping.

Pros:

- *Very little recoil on almost all guns, so gameplay will depend on skill level more than RNG bullet-spread.
- Easy to obtain in-game currency (it takes around 120 games to unlock 1 Assault Rifle if you're using games alone, to obtain currency). Daily logins give you 15k currency (worth 15 games), which saves you approximately 2 and a half hours of TDM grinding. There are also bonuses for logging in every day for a few weeks.
- Finding matches takes around a minute (North American Server, Quick Match), so there's not much downtime on queuing.
- Sounds are satisfying: Headshots are indicated with a ""skull-cracking"" sound and all guns have unique firing sounds.
- *Silencers and laser sights are completely free! (They come with nearly every gun; Snipers do not have silencers or laser sights). Also, every rifle with ""GL"" in its name, will also have a Grenade Launcher! Happy noob-tubing.
- *Having the ability to aim down your sights is always a positive thing, especially when it makes a huge difference in accuracy.
- Walking makes you silent.
- *You can try nearly every gun available for 7 days to figure out which gun you want to purchase first (the DLC is split into three parts and is available on the store page. Once activated from the store page, it stays in your inbox for 30 days before it expires or until you activate it in-game).

Cons:

- All grenades are purchasable and are not defaulted with your character.
- Seems like only ""Green Smoke Grenade 3 Days"" is the only thing available in the Random Boxes; this game is only in Alpha, so that's understandable.
- It's common to see ""high-ping players"" (a.k.a. laggers) in your game lobbies since the servers are still somewhat limited. This is a problem because they are able to kill players that have exited their line of sight.

Asterisk notes (all points with *):

- When starting out, the recoil is very difficult to notice on most assault rifles; everything seems laser-accurate, leaving little room to blame a death on lag or because the bullet-spread wasn't in your favour. If you're coming from Call of Duty, this game will seem like heaven. If you're coming from CS:GO, you won't have to think about bullet patterns here. The recoil will become more noticeable after more gameplay.
- Everyone (regardless of age, gender, level, etc.) has free access to silencers and laser sights. Silencers hide your position on the mini-map when firing and laser sights have no use (that I'm aware of) other than to look cool. Laser sights are (as stated in-game) invisible to the enemy team, so don't worry about giving away your location by shining the laser into a sniper's eye.
- Grenade launchers do not explode on impact. This is a fair compromise for people who love and hate noob-tubers. Noob-tubers can use grenade launchers to their heart's content (although, you only get two grenades with no way to replenish them unless you respawn or pick up a gun that hasn't used theirs), and people who hate tubers have a fair chance to avoid the explosions.
- I thought I was going to enjoy the Scar-H, but after trying the DLC, I decided to main the RL5.

TL;DR
- Every gun is nearly laser-accurate
- Noob-tubing is fair for both sides
- Black Squad > Call of Duty
- Only BS deaths come from high-ping players"
21328,everyone camps and this is pretty much a free version of CS:GO
21329,I love the concept really but there are no Asian servers and the worst part is that the server kicks you automaticaly when you get high ping. Just don't kick people. We are waiting for at least some Asian servers :)
21330,"Nice game hope theyll add SEA server or ASIA server :)

ill recommend it 100% to my friends if it will have Asia or SEA server :)"
21331,A bit slow
21332,Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood Game
21333,Fun game and cool to pass your time while waiting the days to pass for HTC Vive!
21334,sex
21335,ABSOLUTE BEST FPS GAME I PLAYED ; BETTER THAN CSGO
21336,"good
"
21337,"Tis a great game comrads, everyone is equal, there is no pay to win or other capitalist nonsence, there is only you, your gun and the people that want to kill you, the game is actually fair, what you see a lot is OP guns for paying users, none of this in this game comrads, would rate 9.2 hammers and sickles out of 10"
21338,"Gameplay : 90% CSGO and 10% Battlefield (no buy menu and ADS)
Menu and Style : Crossfire type , fre to play but use micro transaction for extras.

I would prefer a paid version and call it CSGO 2"
21339,Jogo muito foda cara e ainda é de graça <3 melhor impossivel
21340,Good.
21341,"Definitley interesting and playable FPS .
 As any other f2p game expect grinding for life, but this game makes it interesting at least in the begining.
 
I did not encounter pay 2 win yet.
"
21342,This game is absoulutley amazing also its good because its free i would reccomend this game
21343,Really good FPS but needs asian and aussie servers
21344,3/10
21345,"A game that I'm good at. Came from CS:GO, everyone is a noob in this game."
21346,"The game is good and very potential, the only downside I could see at this stage is that it doesn't have an asian server.

21347,"This is seriously the best Free to play First person shooter ever made! When they say free to play they actually mean it, you wont find anyone who is absolute shit at the game that is better off because they spent real money on an ingame weapon. The real currency factor in this is pretty much just cosmetic! Here are some reason why i love this game in my few hours of play time (and ill be playing a whole lot more too!)

Great tutorial that will reward you for doing it
Great gunplay
Graphics are nice
Hitmarker sounds so you know if you hit them
Realistic type health
Free to play
Balanced as fuck
Takes some skill to be the best
and i saved the best for last.... SHOTGUNS ARE ACTUALLY VIABLE! seriously every game makes shotguns useless, you wont win the range fight but close quarter you are going to have a fun time! SMGS and pistols also are decent! 
In game currency is so easy to get its insane, dont be afraid to spend some in game currency for that sexy gun you're wanting"
21348,Very Fun and is a blast to play with friends
21349,"Basically, the game is like CS:GO without spawn limit, but actually better.

PROS:
Fun game/gunplay
Good guns


CONS:
Not yet

9/10"
21350,good
21351,"A f2p version of Call of Duty, just even worse."
21352,"Randome recoil pattern
Randome bullets spread
AD AD AD AD Spam
One shot snipers
Badly optimized ( 160-200 fps on i7700k with a gtx 1070) 

Maby the worst game i playd this year."
21353,"The lag is real... Almost un-playable

EDIT: Lag issues has been fixed. Not as bad as before. However new problems has arised... Full of campers every match, even ""high rankers"" and lots of ppl using ""no-recoil"" scripts/macros. Which although is not a hack, it still poses as an unfair advantage to others...

EDIT 2: Just log-in, received a ban. Didn't play a single game. Stupid dumb game."
21354,"So, im currently stationed in South Korea and it sucks that most games that I play are made for the American community, so me trying to play Black Squad I get kicked from every game for hight latency really upsets me! I cant play most games.
"
21355,"- Prompts for administrator rights when starting
- Uses intrusive shitty anticheat software (BattlEye)
- Hitting 'Play' in the launcher does nothing, doesn't even create a crash log or dump
- Clicking any links in the launcher opens IE/Edge instead of default browser
- The launcher ran stable for 5 minutes so i could write this review though 

0/10, Wasted my bandwidth.
"
21356,The best and easy game ever
21357,"This game was very enjoyable to play until they updated it. There are no servers for players in South Africa and when you join any server, you get kicked for high ping. Where should you play then ?? Devs ???"
21358,Vey fun and entartining game. Similiar gameplay to A.V.A (Alliance of valiant arms) but imo opinion much better.
21359,"Only have three sever, High Ping cannot play."
21360,"the game mechanics are horrible, the servers are horrible and there isnt that many of them, i dont even know the tick rate of the servers but its clearly not good, youll underrstand if you play the game. and the worst of all is that the games has so many hackers and no in game report system or at least not one thats easy to find"
21361,Litterly copied and pasted CSGO
21362,"Obviously this game is targeting people who are into shooting games with tactical vibes, like people who are crazily into the combat gears and wepaons. Farily speaking, BS looks damn good with all the finely customized weapons, which makes BS might be one of the few games that actually knows how to correctly add attachments to guns.
I'm one of thoes people who actually loves games that gets the weapon part right, and if you are just like me, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME BECAUSE THAT NICE WEAPON IS THE ONLY THING YOU MIGHT ENJOY.
In depth, this is just another finely dressed Crossfire, everything about this game has that stinky Korean smell: the UI, the music, the large amount of health, the good guns that require ""another form of currency"", the people jump around insanely while shooting each other. The game mode itself has nothing to do with ""military"" or ""tactical"", it's just the same shit over and over again, and you can't even hold to aim or customize your weapons.
Just so you know, people don't really shout ""Tac reload"" while doing reloads."
21363,"Typical ""Made in Korea"" F2P shooter. Maybe a bit better than others but still pretty boring. I think the real game description should be:

Battleye support, dedicated servers (Indeed!), common shooting mechanics and pretty good netcode. Black Squad is a military first-person-shooter game using outdated engine to show mediocre graphics. Absolutely no Pay-to-Win at this moment. Welcome to the typical F2P shooter."
21364,xdddddd
21365,This game is very fun and is worth playing (its free). The graphics are really good for a FTP FPS game but the graphics on it are pretty nice. I like how they have VERY low settings in case anyone with a crappo PC wants to play this game. I am currently using a GTX 750 ti 2 GB and an AMD FX 6300 3.5 GHz and get 120 FPS with everything on ultra. The recoil is pretty wierd but I usually play CSGO so recoil in other games are of course wierd for me.
21366,"Well the game is decent but here are some of MY pros and cons
Pros:
-Feeling of being good whenever gettings kills/etc.
-Easy to play(maybe way too easy)
-Nice Graphics
-Good movement/Gameplay
Cons:
-IT'S TOO EASY(What I mean is that it's so easy to play that even a 5 year old can play it, to justify how easy it is there's practically no recoil whatsoever and it is incredibly easy to kill someone running,maybe jumping, it is so easy to kill someone that if you stand still you're already a dead man/woman which makes defending someplace useless because you'll just get headshotted by a rifleman who's going 500 mph even if your reaction time is better his/her bullets will penetrate your skull before you press mouse 1)
-Connection Problems, they make you leave the game and it's pretty annoying in some situations
-No In-Game Voice Chat

Basically I do not reccomend anyone who's serious about winning and an ACTUAL GAME that's NOT BROKEN 
  *cough*csgo*cough* . If you just wanna play some FPS then this game is somewhat fun"
21367,this game is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BOOOORINNNG
21368,Good Game
21369,Great Game
21370,nice game
21371,"Feels the exact same as every free shooter I grew up playing. Atleast Crossfire had zombies and mutants.

Just save up your lunch money and get Rainbow 6: Siege or CSGO. Atleast those games have region based matchmaking and skill based mechanics."
21372,FINNALY SEA PLAYERS COULD ENJOY THIS GAME GOD DAMIIT MODERATORS HOW LONG IT TAKES!!
21373,"You have to constantly buy grenades and smokes.
Every time you die you have to turn on your laser sight and silencer again.
There is no way to lean and fire.
Recoil is exactly the same pattern every time you fire.
Perfect aim, no cadence to your walk or head bob to the camera. Everything feels synthetic.
Ping is a huge problem that will have you dying 2 seconds before you see an enemy, or getting friendly fire by walking infront of a lagger on your own team.
The ""quick match"" is not what it says it is, the fastest way to join a game is to find one yourself.
Mirroring map designs, although it is balanced, it does not make the design good.

Overall disappointed in how comically unrealistic the combat is for all its features, the solders are lacking human elements that make fps games challenging. Casual at best, I've played arcade shooters better than this."
21374,Always crashes when changing in-game settings.
21375,"OK I have no right of actually have an opinion on thiss game but I can saay that when going into this game I was hoping for a Counter strike like game with Gunplay similar to that of call of duty so that I can adjust my friend into counter strike but just playing the tutorial and playing one game after waiting for too long to keep me interested I just quit within minutes of the first game because it issn't a ""good Game"" its passable for a free game but there are so many more high qaulity F2P games out there TF2 A game from 2007 has a more live playerbase is free and has better gameplay than this it had the quality of an EA Game looks good but isn't fun at all and aall i could about this game is the fact that your friends with Autism and the mental capacity of a 13 Year old whos oblivious even to the fact his IQ is less than 80 and has mostly Fs and will think of this as fun so atleast you can play this with him just because he hates games that don't require to hold shift to run or looks like it came out on an Xbox One despite exclusively playing on an XBox his whole life (My Example is Jake from StratFarm sorry jake ik you like TF2 but i could only think of you and idk if you really are autistic you never answered that question)"
21376,Literally only managed to play for 1 day and after maintenance about half the room and i will be kicked from high ping. Unless something changes dont waste your time.
21377,"I'd personally say it's better than Combat Arms.

has potential"
21378,shiet
21379,"A really fun shooter with neat game modes. If you enjoy CoD or CS, this game seems to take elements from both and combines them into one game. The only negative thing I can say right now is the issues with players from the other side of the world going to American servers with shit ping. There needs to be a ping cap or lock the users to their closest server."
21380,NiCe Game
21381,kinda wish it had aus servers but hey im cool with screwing americans with my 200+ ping all good
21382,"The maps in this game are probably the worst out of any FPS game on planet fucking Earth. I have never played a game with worse maps, and I've been playing FPS games a long time. They need to fire their map designer because I would rather play in a one-room death hall than play the maps in this game.

That being said, the core game mechanics are surprisingly solid and the Koreans have finally figured out how to make a F2P game that isn't pay-to-win, so I suggest giving Black Squad a try if you're into fast-paced shooters like Call of Duty. If you remember Combat Arms back in the beta days, Black Squad is all that and more. As long as you can put up with the stupid maps."
21383,"It's a simplistic F2P FPS, in a day and age where ""hero"" FPS are all the rage it feels alsmost like a retro.

Something I would play in highschool at LAN parties.

It's fun, fairly well balanced, not P2W at all and the dev team listens to the community.

Give it a try!"
21384,"Very good game, became my favorite very quickly. One small complaint is I always have to press T and F to add full attachments to gun every time I spawn they should make it that it saves the attachments until I remove them."
21385,"this game have really bad servers. i mean really bad. join the match ,kick for high ping always. WTF?? if i have a fucking high ping on that match then why the hell you pick that match for me??"
21386,Your typical asian fps.
21387,"I've played a few Free FPS games now and i really like this one. Graphics are nice and i don't have any problems with handling. You can buy every Weapon without spending Money which is really important for me.
Also this game is an Alpha, that means they will still patch alot of things and add new gamemodes or weapons."
21388,It sucks so hard it tries so hard to be an csgo/cod/rainbow six siege look a like that it sucks and i uninstalled it in 5 min please dont ever download it even tho its free it also stands under steam controller but when i connected it it doesnt work en keeps giving me keyboard controlls please fix the game or remove it from steam
21389,"very good if you have the sniper rifle called ""blazer"". its practically the only weapon that matters in this game"
21390,Game is hella fun! And it's free!!!
21391,"i'm Not Saying Black Squad Is The Best FPS Game , But Its Really Good And F2P :)
i hope devs make the game's graphics better :D"
21392,Don't think the anti-cheat is active. Supposedly uses BattlEye yet is more infested with cheaters than CS:GO
21393,This game is hella lit but a few bugs can be fixed.
21394,"been playing for a short while ands it actually pretty good, i havent became fustrated at anyone in game yet so thats always a up.

this is a great pick and play sort of game so if you feeling bored and want to kill time then download and enjoy the fact its free and no p2w"
21395,"I know this is free to play game, but it is  so unbalanced that it`s stupid. Every player  that has a better(payed) weapon, kills you with 1 shoot. Also, you can unload 10-15 rounds in a guy, but he just 1 taps you. You have no grenades( you have to buy them), game is swarmed by cheaters  and campers. If devs pay atention to the cheating problem, and balance the game, it will be one of the best f2p games."
21396,"Really enjoyed the game at first, a lot like counter strike but more game modes. Better variety in weapons would be nice but they are permanent so there is that and they don't take long to unlock. Ever since the new patch I keep getting kicked for high ping ( abt 200) which never happened before  even up to 300 ping so now I can't join a game at all"
21397,No asians servers and they will kick you if your ping is high. Do not waste your money in this game if you belong from Asia.
21398,Really Fun Game
21399,"Aiming is pathetic along with several other things that have been mentioned over and over,yet, no patches or updates so... UNINSTALL. Do not waist hard drive space"
21400,"Wow! Kudos to the Devs for making a worse game than I belived possible!!!! This is a poor man's CSGO. 
Starting the first match, I was startled by absolutely clunky the gameplay is. WTF levels of BAD. Like Arma bad.
I LOL anytime someone refers to ""realism"" in FPS games. There's no such thing. The why in the ACTUAL HECK do Devs 
try to exaggerate the slugishness of ""real combat""?! Whatever... there's no hope for this rubbish."
21401,"Definitely would recomend this game. One of the rare f2p FPS games that are NOT p2w. There are a lot of different weapons to choose from and they are all permenantly yours once you buy them! It's also not hard to earn enough money to buy buy them, especially with their daily 15000 gold rewards and random 30000 gold rewards for completing missions (most weapons cost 120000 gold). 

This game seems to be a nice mixture of CsGO, Crossfire and CoD. The maps are not too big, but they are not too small either, they are just right. Another thing worth mentioning is their recent patch update on Europe servers: Players get kicked out of the match if their ping is above 200! So If you are an European you definitely won't have any bad experiences with lag, unless the problem is with your connection. :)

My ingame username is MrJerryB. Add me if you are up for a match or two."
21402,"This is game is good so far.
But after the fucking server fixing, i kept getting kicked for having high ping.
Add an asian server. there are fuck ton of asians"
21403,"Pros:

>Free-to-play.
>Not pay-to-win.
>Large variety of weapons.
>Well made FPS elements.
>Large variety of different maps & modes.

Cons:

>Lacks unique features.
>Can get repetitive due to the gameplay itself however this may depend on the person.
>You have grind to acquire different weapons, the grind however is not 
that bad as in other games but you still have to grind a bit
>In the developmental stage.
>Some technical problems.

An overall an above average FPS on the whole and with it being a free-to-play it is definitely worth a try or to keep tabs at least. Just bare in mind its cons and that it is in the developmental stage and many features can be changed, added or removed.

Overall I give it a 6.5/10"
21404,Great game. Fresh air
21405,"Why don't the game maker just create an ASIA server, it's not fair for the players which are outside the region area
And what does it mean kicked by high ping??
We are having high ping doesn't mean we can't play the game, it's not our fault far having such a high ping"
21406,"As a FPS player with 15 years of ‘experience’ this is my review:

Pros: 
-	If you're into F2P shooters then this is a safe bet as it has relatively decent gameplay.
-	NO PAY2WIN! It is all based on skill. Within 3 matches I could consistently come top of leader board! 
Cons: 
-	No replayability - As much as I appreciate the lack of pay2win, it still has all of those ANNOYING features designed to make you dedicate your life (and cash) towards only playing this game. For me, this is a cheap way of making the game replayable. This game isn’t replayable because of good mechanics; rather, it is replayable because you are stuck in an endless grind to gather more points for a cosmetic upgrade. 
-	Even if you REALLY enjoy the gameplay there is ultimately nothing to work towards. I got bored of coming top and there isn’t any incentive to continue to play. As mentioned, all unlocks are cosmetic – meaning that there is no tactile benefit to grinding or spending money.
-	I understand that this type of ‘grindy’ F2P game is popular in the Asian market; however, I STRONGLY disagree with this type of attitude as it ultimately stifles the efforts of other game developers who put much more effort into making the experience replayable by investing in solid gameplay mechanics.

Summary: Enjoyable for the first few hours but then you realise there’s nothing to work towards and that there are much higher quality games with a price point. Other game developers put effort into developing unique gameplay mechanics whereas this offers nothing new whatsoever.

Recommendation: 
-	Play the game for a few hours and then leave it alone. 
-	Encourage the devs to up their game by developing unique gameplay mechanics rather than spending their time on new cosmetic items which ‘cheapen’ the gaming market on a whole. 
-	Pay for your games…
"
21407,"Uninstalled, Not our fault we have high pings."
21408,this game is very nice! but plss i need se asia server..i cant play at europe and america server because high ping..
21409,"A decent game recommended to play
Pros:
Different types of weapons
Every weapon has a scope
Various maps and sizes
Decent mechanic
EZ wallbanging

Cons:
CHEATERS EVERYWHERE! VAC SHOULD BE APPLIED
Hitbox is basically broken

"
21410,aids.... MAKE AUS SERVERS
21411,noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
21412,"Loved the game..... until the latest update. I get kicked as soon as i join a game because my ping sits at around 300-350. ;-;  If the devs are reading this, please change that. Thanks."
21413,"is your game dumb?
200 ping i get kick for having a ""HIGH PING"".....
Go fix your shit game
"
21414,"Needs SEA. I have the worst internet making my ping 300-400 in the current servers, but still I play good. The latest patch will get you kick if your ping is high and now I can't play I will get automatically kicked out of the game. Change it."
21415,Mot bad but not fantastic!
21416,Nothing going for it that I can reommend
21417,I've played for about 40 hours but all 40 hours has been waiting in the waiting room. WaitingSimulator/10
21418,Great
21419,"fix your cool but shit game, or make servers in another country, im getting annoyed because i get kicked off the game cause i live in a different cuntry, so you update the game and put stupid kicking rules....fix or game or get rid of it
"
21420,Just please make a server for the asean.....we play in 2++ ping and the new update if there's a pplayer with 2++ ping will be kick out.....its a great game and fun to play but with the server playin in asia will give us 2++ ping.......please...................i love this game.......but with the new update its a problem for asean gamers.....please make it right by make a server for the asean or fixed the problem.....i recommend this game but with the new update.....its just make the game worst
21421,"This game is great for the people that like fps games but don't like to spend a lot, well this doesn't cost anything 👍. It can be hard to get use to but when you do it's really fun and enjoyable. Sometimes it can make you rage a bit. It's slightly hard to earn money in this game, but luckily there's 15k a day for everybody. But one issue is camping, you can't do anything about that but it is annoying."
21422,"You're broke and you want CS:Go.



Say no more"
21423,"Doesn't Start Properly Shows A small window And Says Mantinence Are U Fixing It or no?
"
21424,PLEASE ADD SEA SERVER
21425,"too addicting, in-fact, i found myself grinding out 52 hours in barely a week - toxic community - pls add voice chat - fix hitreg - clarefanclub<3"
21426,"best free2play fps i've seen so far but with one flaw...
GET ASIA SERVER PLSSSS
I CAN'T PLAY THIS AT 200 PING
"
21427,"Awesome Game, Must Play"
21428,Need some improvement especially in weapons xD hahaha
21429,dont like its garbo
21430,"awesome mmo fps and that also for free , there are some glitches though but servers are good and no lagging"
21431,"On the splash screen for the map ""Dock Night"" it shows a building with green neon letters, and it says ""Logstics Systems"" , I believe you meant ""Logistics"", also every day when I play it tells me ""Good Game Well Play!!"". 10/10 would play again"
21432,"Is okay if Heavy have minigun?
Please give Heavy minigun."
21433,"so many people cheating, using walls and or aim assist, ruining the game
"
21434,"There are plenty of hackers in the game. At first it gives a good feel to come back with those F2P P2W FPS copies, but now its boring. Sheety game. 5/10."
21435,"The game would be pretty awesome if BattlEye didn't suck at finding hackers. Also, the game is like 70% player base from other countries playing on NA servers with 250+ pings!!! Which means you die behind cover a lot. You also find players with freaking 600+ pings teleporting and since this game has no high ping kick they can play like that forever... Honestly I would rather have the hackers over teleporting players with super high ping not taking damage."
21436,"Painfully mediocre. Also, figuring out how to join a game was a bit less straight foward than it should be."
21437,honestly this game is so much fun. it gets really addicting and it's very well made. I hope it's the next big thing and it's really the best free game on steam right now. 10/10.
21438,Well cheating is a must in this game so that everyone can be even! :)
21439,"Completely pay to win, the premium weapons are pretty much double the strength of the non premiums.
Also a large connection problem with 10 of your rounds being cancelled out by 1 of your opponents.
Not worth the download unless you fancy whacking in your credit card details straight away!"
21440,"My first introduction to a run and gun type fps...normally a counter strike player and it was a fantastic experience, I see this game being played competitively in the future with some help from the community and as long as it doesnt turn into a pay to win type of fps."
21441,"Where is the button ""Report Cheater"" or something like this?"
21442,Dont even think about it
21443,"This game is about as dry and boring as a Free to Play shooter can get. Lame gun mechanics, awful gameplay, awkward movment, horrible graphics. Avoid this trash. Looks like it was cobbled together by one guy in 6 months."
21444,"Movement feels very stiff, if you like it... go ahead, if you don't then you might want to look for another shooter."
21445,"it was pretty good i highly recommend it, though if multiple people use your source of internet other than yourself id suggest playing at less busy time."
21446,Rubbish.
21447,"awesome game. Its f2p, has good hit detection and stuff (bullets are hitscans if you care)
There are a ton of famous guns eg MSR, and the infamous noobtubes.
The maps are great too, and for each map there are guns that perform better on those maps. I like that
Overall great first hour, quick and fun tutorial.
As its f2p you would almost expect OP guns you need to pay 5€ for, and weird bs skins and an RNG system. There is none. A f2p game asks for less money then a 60€ cod game. keep it up guys"
21448,"Not the most amazing game on steam, but definitely not bad for a f2p... you don't have to pay money to perform well in game. I enjoy around 3-4 matches to get my aim warmed up for pubg.."
21449,"this is a very good game i like it im pretty good at it 

BUT PLEAS ADD ZOMBIES PLEAS I BEG YOU 

PLEASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

I LOVE ZOMBIES LIKE THIS GAME"
21450,Weapons?  Great!  Game looks?  Awsome!!  Not pay to win?  Great!!!  But that is about it.  Other than that this is about as stupid of a game as one could make.  Example.  If you want to win just get your team mates all to carry gun turrets and whammo no problem.  Walk around the corner to face 4 gun turrets.  Really?   You can also call in hellpike missles as many times as you want in one game.   Oh and artillery and Many other OP crap that it makes the game no fun at all.  That is just the game part.  The next part will be the downfall of this game.  Hacks.  OMG!  Even saw an aimbot I have not seen since CS 1.4.  The spin headshot.  LOL  Walls.  I am telling you it is a hackfest in there.  Cudos Developers you tried to go up against CS.  Sorry but this is a major failure.  No realism what so ever.  Other than looks.  I would give this game -5 stars out of 10.
21451,Racist Yes. Good game? No
21452,"Honestly the game has no performance issues at all, runs rather well but the game itself is pretty trash. I played one match and went 46 and 5 and It felt like I was playing a free version of CSGO with downsyndrom. Guns have no recoil, you can jump and shoot with 100 percent accuracy. The controls are a mess so youll have to take the time to key bind everything to make it playable. I give it a 2 out of 10. Tis a shitty rip off for people who are trash at CSGO. Looks decent for being run off of the unreal 3 engine which is terribly out dated now. Dont take my word for it though, play it yourself and youll see what I mean. Unless your trash at CSGO then this game is probably going to be one of your favorites.

Only thing I really liked was how every weapon has a lazer sight and silencer that can be attached at any desired time during a match and that you can aim down your sights for every gun, tis the only thing this game has on CSGO."
21453,"This game is amazing its simple as that, I cant wait for the full official version of the game to come out. However, there are some changes that in my opion if implemented it will help massivly!
Firstly, the game needs to have an improvement recarding the voices. The voices seem to be kinda old like Combat arms
Secondly, people spam at the start of the round the reload button and it gets annoying.
Thirdly, I saw the korean version of this game and its amazing the skins and knives are georgous we need some of them.
Moreover, something EXTREMLY IMPORTANT is that the game needs to have a voice message where people can communicate.
All this comes from a guy like me who had over 2500 hours put onto a game called counter strike I reached the highest rank and I got bored.
This game has huge potential. 
Thank you
"
21454,"This must be one of the best free to play games on Steam!Definitely Download it!Its fast paced,Lost of weapons and definitely not pay2win!If you are a fps lover who enjoys a challenge,this is definitely for you!"
21455,Unreal Call of Counter-Strike...
21456,"Alright, game. good game to just play around with friends and and fun"
21457,"I am not a fan of this game. I liked it at first then started to notice issues such as physics and damage detection. If you are shot in the face it should not matter what kind of gun it is. Time and time again I have emptied clips in peoples faces only to get one shotted by a handgun WTF??? Really this could be a good game if they fixed stuff like this. Also the clipping when you are about to get killed?? I have a 7ms ping with internet speeds exceeding 500mb/ps and yet everytime I know Im going to die because the game lags for about 1-2 seconds and Im dead, no other Free or payed for FPS does this. Even Ghost in the Shell that is being shut down does not have this problem. Make guns/gear more affordable, and rewards so they are worth trying to earn.  You will loose your player base eventually with this pay to win model your rocking at the moment. Either make it a game you pay for or entirely free this half foot in half foot out approach is ridicualas. I would not recomend this game to anyone in its current state."
21458,"Game has only been released a month ago and here are my thoughts:
1. Bomb defusing time needs to be fixed in a way. Takes 7 seconds to defuse a bomb that has a short timer, and most of the time it's on the opposite side of the map.

2. I play on NA servers and I'm getting asians 9 out of 10 games.They have 300 ping btw.

3. The AK is really overpowered in the sense that the headshot hitbox is wayy to big. Nerf the dmg or the hitbox.

4. When sniping with blazer for example, the need to right click zoom in after every shot is repetitive, please add an option to change.

5. Nades need to be more mobile, I toss a grenade and it hardly moves."
21459,loved it.  game is solid.  mecanics are cool and easy.  tutorial was actually fun!  https://youtu.be/gkzXySUL5ag
21460,"It was nice at first but the comabt is stupid, the UI may just be the worst I have ever seen, takes a new player 25+ min to grasp what to do to get into a game. This game has no skill gap and requires mostly luck."
21461,Better then CS:GO
21462,"come play guys im looking for people to play with :(!!!


LEL WAT!!"
21463,"I have no idea why people like this game, this is most pure Bullshit i have played in a while, lags, want cool gun? buy it for 7 days ? cool cool, fuck no, bullshit at its best, poor kid csgo+cod"
21464,I was enjoying the game for about 1 hour untill the In game currency got stuck.. 1/10 since its broken. Complete trash.
21465,Very unbalanced weapons. Takes about 2 shots with an AK while it takes 6-8 shots with a Glock to kill. It is F2P but you can pay if you want Bonus content.
21466,XDD
21467,a good fps game
21468,Another full retard f2p shooter
21469,not bad and bot too good. but if you are looking for a free game then you can check  it out
21470,Fun Game
21471,Good graphic:)
21472,If you could integrate the weapon testing within the inventory panel that'd be great.
21473,"Black squad is a free to play FPS that has no pay 2 win and entertaining gameplay. The game has 4 current game modes, Team Deathmatch (Basic Head to Head massacre until kill limit is reached), Demolition (Turn based, Attack and defend), Assassination ( Defend NPC instead of bomb and escort to location before team is wiped out), and Battle mode (Defending and attacking certain points to destroy them and win). This game has balanced weapons but slightly unfair health which results in almost instant death when shot. The game has interesting maps which are all almost original which is good for an FPS. The game has no Pay2Win whatsoever at the moment, the only things in the game that cost money are cosmetics.

Unfortunately, there are still no Australian servers but hopefully they'll be added soon. At the moment, I highly recommend this extremely fun FPS which is completely free!"
21474,Above average f2p fps
21475,Lots of fun. Didn't expect it to be as good as it is although the guns need balancing and it appears to have people botting.
21476,Fun
21477,"This game allows people to play out of region giving them a major advantage for having higher ping. I have never seen so many high pings in the same match, with some people over 700 ping. This alone is why I don't recommend this game. If it wasn't for ping advantage, I would rate this game thumbs up.

Other than that, there is some minor quirks about the game that makes it more clunky than it should be, but it isn't nearly as bad as other free to play shooters. This game does seem to cater to old school military shooters.  If you were one of those who liked old style shooters, then give it try. Otherwise, I really don't see people enjoying it.

EDIT: Just to add, just seen that some powerful guns locked behind premium currency. Also finding many multihackers. Hacking with ping advantage... Well now, I really will not recommend this game to anyone.

THE GAME IS LITERALLY WHO HAS THE HIGHEST PING OR THE MOST HACKERS! YES IT IS THAT BAD!"
21478,TAC RELOAD!
21479,Its a good game to get if your that person taht looks for game that are free when you are borad
21480,"Good Game, does not seem to be very pay to win because most guns are unlockable via the currency you earn by playing."
21481,"Holy shit, this game is terrible.

It's a half-assed, poorly made Chinese(?) F2P tacticool shooter. Medicore graphics, unsatisfying gunplay, [i]typos in the tutorial[/i].

Do avoid if you prefer games that aren't terrible.

I thought it was so terrible I went out of my way to leave a review. It's that bad."
21482,"how tf is this game going to compete with csgo, and rainbow six?"
21483,"I played it for nearly an hour and saw all there was to offer.
The gameplay is super janky and yes its EA.
The movement is a mix between CS and Warface.
The gameplay is a mix of CS and Warface too, the game having CS movement and Warface shooting.
Scar fires 100% always center of screen and it's total BS how accurate it is.
The mouse movement feels slower and jankier than anything.

Would not recommend.
Just play CS or Warface instead. 
Or better yet, go play TF2."
21484,Amazing FPS shooter
21485,Not worth the money...
21486,"This game is fucking dumb 


10/10"
21487,"One of the best games in terms of gameplay and F2P, the graphics could be increased and more gun skins should be added to make it more fun, overall, nice game!"
21488,"Verry good game , I'm playing it for couple of days allready and feels like is one of the best FPS game out there so you gotta try it boys and girls :D The only problem that i have is one shot sniper but ill get used to it :D Have fun !"
21489,"THIS SUCKS, run at 64bit crash at startup.
run at 32 bit, crash when entering game lmao"
21490,Really nice game with good updates every time..also its good for practiceing for csgo
21491,i love this game this game has good graphics and 5 mods to play with but there's 1 thing sucks in this game and that is Sniper. but overall this game is good
21492,"great and really enjoyable game 

but i have one note that i think it will make the game more enjoyable 

and is to add sprint to the character that will be really great ! 

RECOMMEND (Y) ."
21493,"i really love this game the best thing is that its for free
"
21494,The game is excellent and finnaly a game that is csgo themed but not a complete ripoff.
21495,"Pro:
Tac Reload

Con:
Everyone has 200+ ping on NA servers"
21496,I like this game :D
21497,yeah game is mix of cs and battlefield but awsome game !!
21498,"It's a good game, but I wish there would be a customization sistem (put on another sight, ect.)"
21499,AimBot hacks like any f2p game and it sucks.
21500,"Free-To-Play done proper.Fun weapons,game modes are interesting,and good grinding challenges and nice to have something to take a break from TF2.

Cons:Not a fan of weapons that expire (especially with grenades.Please add permenant grenades&card items),Please add a feature that allows the host of the server or a vote kick option to kick anyone who is causing trouble because a lot of kids get on and love to scream ""NI**ER FA**OT and things like that through chat everytime they get killed (the main problem with F2P games),the maps are a little small although still fun,a password system on Destruction mode would be nice,and finally please allow it to where you can have any amount of players as long as they're is at least 4 in the entire room so people wont have to wait in order to play.

I give this game (although still in development) an 8/10.Good job guys.Keep up the hard work."
21501,"Not a bad game to be honest, especially for free!
I have enjoyed playing what I have so far, and do enjoy it!"
21502,"This is a very fun game :)
I really like the gameplay, animations, textures and the look of the game basically :)"
21503,When you buy CSGO from wish:
21504,nahhhh
21505,SO GOOD GAME LIKE BLACK OPS !!!!!
21506,i need sever Asia

21508,Pretty terrible.
21509,"While this is a fun arena-type shooter, I am going to have to give it an overall negative review. The core mechanics of the game are fantastic, and most of the gunfighting is fun. I have two main issues with this game that ruin the entire experience though:

1.) Connection problems. Not that I have an issue connecting, it's that people from Taiwan can happily connect to US servers with over 300 ping [spoiler](Not racist to people from Taiwan, there was a guy in a clan called Taiwan with over 300 ping in my last game).[/spoiler] In a normal shooter game this might be acceptable sometimes, not in an arena-style shooter. Most of the games I played the MINORITY of people had less than 100 ping. It can completely ruin a match for me.

2.) Grenades. Grenades are probably the one thing that kills me the most in this game. If you see the grenade indicator, you already have lost 50 HP. If the grenade lands ontop of you, you're dead and you have no way to escape it. So when groups of 2-5 people keep spamming grenades down one of the many tiny hallways this game has, it just leads to a frustrating time.

If they fixed the connection issues and (I'm not even joking) removed grenades entirely, I would wholeheartedly recommend this game. Sadly, I cannot."
21510,"its so much fun, though it can ""surly"" improve i think its really good for an early access game."
21511,Blatent rip off of CS go. Make an original game.
21512,i want to like this game its well made and the gamplay is balenced and thought out but there is in almost 95% of matches a blatent aimbot hacker not like they have a decent score they might be cheating... like 60+kills and less than 5 deaths snap lock on aimbot trash.... oh well ill check back in a month or so and see if thay have fixed the cheating problem untill then dont waste your time if you are competitive in fps gameing
21513,fucking amazing
21514,"how do you get BS coins. they need to make skins more ubtainable, game is to bland without them. people like to be custom and differnt from others
"
21515,I really like this game but i need to know if you can use a controller with it. does anybody know?
21516,Great game
21517,"Fix the map size issue, it's almost absurd."
21518,Terrible! This game is pay to win!
21519,It's pretty good for an early access game. The mechanics are simple and there are alot of game modes to choose from. The weapons are balanced in my opinion. The aiming is pretty easy to get used to. I just wish there were asia servers for lesser ping.
21520,"AMAZING ! has great potential i love the gameplay, the  main page user interface, the music, the guns, and the graphics. really good. make an offline mode and ill pay a full 60$ for it =]"
21521,"pretty Good Game , Loved the Killing Animation it got Perfect 1 vs 1 Prespect i mean it doesnt take over 5 bullets to kill 

someone which make's it normal , looooooooooved the gun animation alot better than A.V.A the game got a bright future

""I would love if you added split screen into Black Squad, then my dad and I can play! XD""

3. Zombies Mode

4.Voice Chat
""I don't know if you added this but, if you did't please add it.""

Please, Please Please add this, Im only 9 years old and my dad will not let me play Call of Duty.

You big gamer, MakinBurgers

Oh and I rate this game 10/10"
21526,Great game really recommend it to other players that love first person shooter and that is free
21527,"The overall balance is pretty bad.
Guns like the AK will outclass anything you can buy with credits.

There's better free2play games on steam, skip this one."
21528,Here's an idea for a new game...let's copy and paste CS:GO and name it something really cool. Next idea...lets use an old engine and take this game to the next level... pretty much a game good til 3017 nah mean.
21529,solid f2p fps game. NO PAY2WIN!
21530,"This is a very fun game, it has flaws, but nothing that is terribly frustrating. Its a strangely satisfying cross between Counter Strike and Modern Warfare, but manages to be different at the same time. Another good thing is that its not an annoying free game that's always trying to get you to buy something in game. The guns are unlockable through normal play time, with the option for some dlc packs and guns, this however does not make it unbalanced. There are plenty of maps with responsive and solid servers. I'm looking forward to seeing how this game develops and improves."
21531,ajaira game
21532,wery gud game +1
21533,"It's an awesome game. Has lots of options like guns, classes and characters. The feel of the game is great too."
21534,"Its 4 stars for a free game. Well designed, great graphics, and a nice gameplay!
"
21535,"It took me a while to write this review as I was on the fence on whether I could recommend this game to a friend, or not. I eventually came to the realization that I cannot recommend this to a friend in it's current state. I really enjoy this game personally, but due to certain issues which arise in competitive game play that this game does nothing to address I cannot in good faith recommend anyone pick this game up, when the competition this game has (other titles) address these issues.


Black squad is a free to play competitive tactical shooter developed in Korea with the goal of not offering an edge to those who chose to support the game with money. Everything aside from cosmetic items can be earned inside the game with enough playtime. This, black squad does well, and I have no complaints with as they've done a good job in doing so. Nothing is too unbalanced, and the devs change guns as needed to keep this balance.

The main con this game has going for it, is the same con that most free to play shooters have. They allow access to players not included in their region allowing an unfair advantage to those playing outside the server area, and they have a poor anti cheat system in place. These seem like small complaints, but when the game markets itself as a competitive tactical shooter those two aspects need focused more than the next weapon or map being added. On any given day during morning time in NA, 250 is the average ping of the people playing on NA servers: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1117520323

Their also also quite a few cheats floating around for the game, that have been here since launch. I'm not here to point any fingers, but those who are blatant stay active within the game with no seen repercussions. The worst part about this is no in game offered support to report said players. We all know cheats are a thing when it comes to any game, but at least give us the option to tell the devs which players are suspicious, so action can be taken against those players instead of having to fight them multiple times through matches throughout game.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1113860532


I know the game is still in early access, but if the devs implement changes to these regards I will update my review accordingly. The game has potential, but is in a pretty bad state at the moment. IF these issue don't get addressed soon, I don't forsee a future for this title. I can't honestly say I want to invest too much time into a game that might not exist in 6 months. Most of the time, what keeps this style of games alive is the community. With the state the game is in now, there isn't much of a community.


TL:DR
Game play is awesome, but is suppressed by the issues that community makes clear that development doesn't address. Without serious changes I cannot recommend this game with other titles like Counter Strike, Team Fortress 2, Rainbow 6, Dirty Bomb and Blacklight Retribution exist."
21536,"A Amazing Game, Still has it's slight bugs and glitches though"
21537,"not bad game, but i don't like its engine,it's too bad for 2k17 games, this game has potential 
"
21538,Great free game.

21540,"== OLD REVIEW ==

After playing for 3 days I can already write a review.

The game looks good, enough for what a shooter should look. The focus on a shooter has to be smooth gameplay, not graphics.

I like that the game modes, brings forth other games like Battlefield 3(Destruction), Call of Duty MW3 (TDM) and Counter-Strike(Demolition). I played all 3 games and I can say the game successfully brings them back.

The only major flaw in this game is balance. There is no balance whatsoever. All guns shoot the same. Rifles are more accurate than Snipers or enjoy similar feel of accuracy. You can be sniped by ARs in sniper spots by people strafing, running and jumping. Also there is no stamina penalty for running, ducking or jumping. It makes really hard for the game to find its own balance since everyone moves too fast(BF3 suffered from this) and spams jumping, strafing and ducking. Your character feels like rambo. If you are good enough, you can take whole waves of respawn with an AR, more if you are using SR-47. 

I don't mind dying fast for ARs, but dying to SR-47 or other medal weapons feels always like 1 shot episodes, even in greater distances like sniper exchanges. I don't mind rewarding players with better guns, I fact I like the idea. What I don't like is putting guns in the game and forgetting to balance it out. Some guns don't have recoil and others have their in-game accuracy set too high and combined with no movement penalty, shit just hits the fan.

I really liked the game. It is not heavy on your PC. Everything is very clear from the get-go. You get a tutorial, you learn about skills(really nice system) and you get your guns(free DLCs). But after some time you start to feel the inconsistencies.

I think the game devs needs to sit with professionals and other players and really make a huge improvement on gameplay to patch up stuff. To get an idea what I'm talking about, what Lidiel(Korean?) youtube montages of him playing Black Squad. He wields around several guns with same results, many headshots.

------------------------------- NEW REVIEW

After 800h issues remain the same, with minor patches to duck spam.

== NEWEST REVIEW

As it is with the best worst things in our life, it started it all with a promise. Now it is just a corpse of what it used to be, memories. This games needs to die."
21541,Dead game. No one plays now
21542,okay game nothing special
21543,"A CASUAL game.
The recoils are a bit strange, no damage direction indicator (or they are invisible for me); for a game supposed to be ""the best F2P shooter on the market"" I see too much balance issue, weapons aren't greatly balanced, the best weapons have to be paid with real money, by ""the best"" I mean the one that can one shot in the head. (the CAR, higher damage rifle ""avaible"" from the start can't one shot in the head but the AK47 with the same firing speed and less recoil can) 
I still recommend it, it's a good game for CASUAL players, but this is absolutly not a competitive game, balancing and the P2W/ level up to earn things are the issues.
Edit: The mouse sensitivity is horrible.
Ho and I don't recommend this unbalanced P2W game anymore."
21544,"Was fun for the first 2 hours but then after that I started noticing things that just shouldn't be a thing.

Pros-
*Pretty decent free-to-play first person shooter, if not one of the best at the moment.
*Gunplay is fun, movement is pretty smooth, and quite a bit of variety.
*Good for casual play.
Cons- 
*Hit detection feels a bit awful.
*You can constantly get killed by people who you dont even see, or when you've just entered cover. Netcode :/
*Guns feel unbalanced, there are some that take quite a long time to earn up to and just don't feel fair. There's SMGs that literally do more damage than a lot of assault rifles, people just running around a corner full speed spraying you down with one. Not to mention some sort of auto-shotgun that kills in like 2 hits.

For a player who likes to play FPS games competitively I wouldn't recommend this, obviously it's a free to play game and shouldn't really be thought of highly. But if you can't afford to be buying well built FPS games, then this is the game for you, really fun for casual play and if you REALLY want to play it competitively then you gotta put up with the faults."
21545,"So far, I am having fun like it's been amazing finding out about black squad. I even bought the ak12fennec dlc just to support the game.
"
21546,Fun game. Like an improved Call of Duty. Needs Asian servers or better yet Oceanic servers.
21547,"Besides playing agasint only people that have 300+ ping its a good game. Should prob make it to where NA is a sep server to fix the lag. 
"
21548,TAC RELOAD/10
21549,Can't change mouse movement setting during madatory tutorial. Can't get down first ladder with spullied key actions wihtout stuffing around.* No obvious exit game option from  rmain menu* Characteristic of all dodgy games. Had to Crl Atl Del to kill it.
21550,"It's like the bastard child of Call of duty and Counter Strike: Global offensive. 

But im already addicted"
21551,"حلو
"
21552,"Always been looking for an fps game that has a feeling of satisfaction when you kill your enemy, similar to old games like Soldier Front, BlackShot, Sudden Attack. CSGO to me is just old, and killing people feels bland. Just too bored of it. If you ever feel like playing any other shooter games, this is the game for you. Now, if they add more servers around the world, especially for SEA regions, that would lower the ping of NA/EU players and create a more enjoyable experience for all.

Positive:
1) Satisfaction during kills.
2) Scope on weapons.
3) Nice graphics.
4) Different modes (TDM, Demolition, Battle).
5) Good looking weapon skins. (Cosmetics require real money)
6) All weapons are free (You have to grind some gold to get them all of them).
7) Character skins (Finally, different characters, hopefully some females too.)
8) Hey, its a FREE TO PLAY game. (Definately NOT pay to win, more of a pay for skins).
9) Same hitboxes for the different character skins.

Negative:
1) High ping due to players from other regions joining in. (However, they're planning to add more servers.)"
21553,Awesome game. It reminds me of COD before they became idk...bad. Can't believe this game is free.
21554,How can this game have so many positive reviews this is fucking garbage game
21555,"Black Squad needs to figure out its identity crisis between COD, CSGO and kinda Combat Arms. The game is really fun though and planning to put some serious hours on this game."
21556,Tac reload
21557,TAC RELOAD
21558,"Honestly good game it does have some issues as it is play to win, but if you loved the old call of duty's you need to try it because it gave me that feeling."
21559,Quite fun eh
21560,Good fast pace shooter
21561,"30% Battlefield 
70% Call of Duty
Black Squad is a slighly (very slight) team based twitch shooter where you kill people and things with guns and stuff. You can think of it as Call of Duty with no sprint button (you do move faster with melee out similar to CSGO) and instead of awarding killstreaks with massacreing enemies you are awarded with points in which you can use on special abillities from 4 different reward classes that you pick at the start of each match. 
The game is definitly not for everyone and if you hate twitch style shooters then this is a nightmare. 
If you don't care then the game is free so no loss after downloading."
21562,"Kind of lame. It's a janky amalgamation of CoD, CS:GO, and Team Fortress, but doesn't do anything as well as any of those games. F2P games are usually F2P for a reason..."
21563,"Im really loving this game! in the future, it might become big of a game like CSGO... one thing though, are you guys planning to expand your servers to OCEANIA?"
21564,Não gostei.
21565,meh to ez
21566,"if you ever wanted to do a ""tac reload"" in a game while listening to tactical music, then this is the game to get. I have never felt so tactical ever since I played tactical intervention (another great game)."
21567,"Imagine a mix between CSGO And Call Of Duty then you have Black Squad. This game is quite easy to play and understand.

Pros:
+ Graphics are a bit outdated but still looks nice
+ Easy to play
+ Good sound effects
+ Fun maps to play on
+ Free to play

Cons:
– Some small bugs
– People can shoot me through walls haha
– No ranking system"
21568,"Decent if you just want a generic shooter game :)

Theres a few stuff to know before playing this game

-A few cheaters
-People from far away countries joining your region with 300 ping or more (lately you can even see 999 ping....)"
21569,"pretty good game just one thing that bugs me is, the damadge is overkill (ye get it nvm) and thus the game is easy once your in it. other than that it is a 9/10"
21570,"nice
"
21571,Well what`s hapening to me is when i start the Game everything loads youst fine then i press on play and and the Game youst closes can anyone please help me?
21572,Every1 haz aim haz and they gey
21573,NEEDS alotta work but over all ITS GREAT!!!!Tryed it first time today and im already recommending this game!!! for sure i was a avid cs source and AVA allaince of vailiant arms player this best yet
21574,"the game is pretty good for a free to play i think its much better than the original series counter strike but there s some problems to it of course first the guns have a lot of recoil wich is understandeble but one thing i dont understand is whyy always playing against people 3x better than you i mean youre like lv 5 ok so good you should play against lv 5 to 7 max but acctualy you play against clans and double clans of 3 to 4 people wth levels much higher ex i played against a 23 last mach and we had random team mean no clan against an entire clan guys like whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat explain me that give me one reason to not unistall this stupid freaking game out of my library ?? 

anyway i recommend this game its fun and fast paced but stop wth the tryhards clans pls 

MUCH LOVE FOR BLACK SQUAD <3"
21575,"This game is pretty fun.... for like the 2 first hours.
This game has a lot of problems, and I will explain them.

-The first problem is that every map has the same 3 parts:
1) The middle
2) The place where there are at least 3 snipers
3) The place that no one is going to

-The second problem is that after 2-3 hours, you will start to notice that every game is going like this: 
You're running to the middle part of the map, killing one player, almost killing the second (he kills you), you respawn and do the same thing again.

-The third problem is the guns.
There are some guns that feel the same.
There is a sniper rifle called ""blaser r93"" that 90% of the snipers are using.

There are a lot of other problems but I still recommend this game for those who just want to play a nice game for like an hour and then want to play something else like cs go or rainbow six siege."
21576,"I thought we are past '06 where items had an expiration timer.
I guess I WAS WRONG!"
21577,very good game not a big fan of graphics
21578,"This game is solid, great graphics, fun game play with excellent sound effects. I do wish the TDM maps were larger, hope they incorporate the Demolition maps into some TDM's!

Overall I give the game a
 9.0 for Gameplay
10.0 for Sound effects
10.0 Map design
7.0 for TDM map size (to small and too many ways to get cornered!)
10.0 for all other map sizes!"
21579,"Really easy game to pick up and play. Everything is straightforward. Guns almost dont even matter with what you use, it is very reaction time based as well as rng, since shots do not always register for some reason. Hit a guy with an equivalent of the AWP, a one shot, but he doesnt die and after 3 more AR shots still doesnt die. (Multiple times this happens). Hitboxes are wonky, and AR's are accurate while running and jumping, which is stupid. snipers work like AWM's though, crouch moving they are accurate, or you have to stand still. Overall, its a fun game to not take seriously."
21580,Fun at first then you find the hackers cheaters campers and quick scopers. There seems to be alot of shooting someone a bunch only to turn around and have them gun down you and 3 other people instantly
21581,This game needs to go back the browser it came from
21582,this game sucks go back to your browser ....
21583,"TLDR; This game has an amazing weapon feel, that KA-DOSH when you HS someone is so satisfying. Fast paced, polished. 
A mix of CSGO and CoD, finally a game like CS where you can aim down all the weapons. 

"
21584,"Very gud game.But please fix jump shots
"
21585,recommend
21586,"If you like Counter Strike and Call of Duty, you guaranteed gonna like this game.

This game has a good population of players, and its keep going up. 

Black Squad has a high chance to be a good competitive FPS.

Keep in mind: Its free2play (no pay2win at all) so, just try it out, if you don't like it you can just uninstall it.

Have a good day!"
21587,"You cannot report hackers in this game, many people does hack in this game. 
Game is awesome, but hackers ruined it."

21589,"Very sad, i am from india used to love this game with over 80 hours of gameplay earlier i had playable ping from 170-190 ms in EU server but from last week or so i have been getting a terrible ping of 260ms :( only in this game stopping playing this game now with a humble request to black squad team if u are reading this please fix this .Thousands of people must be playing from indian region who might be having a same thing to say and might end up making the same decision ."
21590,TAC RELOAD!!!
21591,"After playing this game, which I'll say they did pretty well on the visuals and the gameplay. However, the only gripe I have in this game is that the Maps are too small. One team could easily get spawn camped. Get it for the Gameplay but not the maps their too small, the size of Nuke Town EUggg"
21592,"I have tried to enjoy this game. However, the mechanics of it just don't allow me to. This game is directed towards those who jump around corners and then proceed to ""spray and pray"". Low-recoil guns have too much of an advantage over guns that the player has to work to control properly. This should never be the case. For those players attempting to use harder weapons, they need to be given the benefit of having an upper hand if they learn how to use harder weapons effectively. This is a dumbed down FPS game for which I cannot determine the intended audience. I appreciate what they're trying to do (create new FPS games), but they're going about it the wrong way. Games do not stay alive without a competitive scene, and this game does not support a competitive scene with the low skill-cap. You can disagree with my recommendation, but I don't see a future for this game. The only redeeming feature of the game currently is that it is resisting being a ""pay-to-win"" game. However, with every free-to-play game, this is bound to change over time. You're more than welcome to try this game out for yourself, but I will not recommend it. I will continue to play it to see if anything improves, but as of now... I do not find my experience on this game enjoyable."
21593,"It's free, so there is little to complain about. But if I wanted a shooter where I don't have to engage my brain, I probably wouldn't choose this one."
21594,"if only SEA server is available.

too lag to play in the current servers..."
21595,"My friend told me to download this game, I played it and some polack told me to uninstall. And so i did."
21596,A very good FPS game. Still waiting for the Asia Server/Sea Server. :D
21597,"Un gioco marcato pay2win.
Faccio un esempio brevissimo e facilissimo: Ti danno 3 armi, un fucile d'assalto, una mitraglietta e un fucile da ""cecchino""...tutto chiaro fino a questo punto no? Perfetto...Tu ti prendi la tua bella arma simpatica, per esempio il tuo bel cecchino, che visivamente sembra tutto bello sai una di quelle armi che guardi e dici ""mado ma con questo spano la gente!""...Spari in testa ad una persona, in testa eh, IN TESTA CON UN FUCILE DA CECCHINO e non muore...lui ti osserva quel secondo, un colpo AL PETTO ti uccide, un SINGOLO colpo al PETTO, nemmeno in testa...Già questo vi fa capire molto del gioco, il primo che paga quei suoi 5-10€ (credo siano questi i prezzi per sti giochi inutili) vince di sicuro, spari a qualcuno per mezz ora con il tuo fucile d'assalto? (vedendo palesemente 50 spruzzi di sangue che gli escono dal corpo ogni volta che lo becchi) Niente, lui si gira, 0.5 secondi che ti spara ( mentre se a metà vita) e ti ammazza, mentre lui a full vita con 15 colpi a segno su 20 non muore...bello bilanciato sto gioco eh! 
Da evitare assolutamente, se vi piace spendere soldi su giochi inutili copiati da altri giochi (a loro volta inutili) spendete i vostri 10-20-30€ e sarete felici, felici di poter avere il cazzo più lungo e potendo ammazzare la gente in meno di un secondo, senza i vostri 20-30€ ma chi se ne frega dei soldi, meglio spenderli per un free to play che morirà nell'arco di 5-6 mesi.

P.S: Mi sono informato dopo e tutti quanti quelli che mettono pollice in su dicendo ""NON è P2W GUYS NON LO E' FIDATEVI HUEHUEHUE"" Sono stati pagati per dirlo, ripeto...bel gioco! Comprarsi visibilità e recensioni positive da 2.50€ l'una per avere una massa di bimbi che non possono permettersi counter strike e quindi giocano a questo pur non avendo niente a che fare con counter strike! (se non il fatto di potersi guardare le armi da 5000€ premendo Y o che premendo Shift vai più lentamente ma hey sono cose utili al gameplay! Aiuteranno solo i bimbiminchia a vantarsi delle proprie armi in CeD!)"
21598,"Why can't I play it? It says ""An error has occured with the anti-cheat program. The game will now be closed. Please restart the game. PLEASE REPLY QUICK!"
21599,"хрень повна , я перший раз зайшов в  игру и мене вже кикнули за чіти"
21600,"After 15 years of playing counter strike and thousands of dollars and hours later, a game comes along that can truly compete with it as long as the devs don't get greedy. 5v5 competitive T vs CT bomb plant/defuse. You can't ask for more from a free to play game. Looks better and performs better than csgo."
21601,fast pace shooter good fun
21602,"Tried starting up the game, an error pops up saying there's problems with my anticheat, I don't understand -,-"
21603,"System like freaking Counter strike nexon zombies but this is masterpiece(ALL IN ONE)
MASTERPIECE IS BEACUSE THIS GAME ISNT PAY2WIN ACTUALLY YOU CANT BUY ANYTHING WITH YOUR MONEY ONLY WITH YOUR SKILL IN GAME"
21604,"Pros:
- Free
- Fulfills the basic needs of a FPS game
- Is not pay to win

Cons:
- No gun customization. You buy a gun with its own attachments (i.e. scopes) already.
- I find myself not using the scopes on a gun much. Aiming with a scope misses due to high recoil. Spraying is somehow more accurate.

OVERALL: 2.8/5
Black Squad fulfills your basic FPS game. They have four game modes to keep you playing (Team Deathmatch, Demolition, Assassination, Battle Match). So far, I find myself playing Demolition (plant the bomb/search and destroy) the most. You earn currency through gameplay to buy weapons and items at a fair rate (currency not earned too fast or too slow). Black Squad is not anything amazing, but it is not bad either; just about average or a little bit above average. I find myself playing this game when i need an escape from COD or other well known FPS games. It is free, so it does not hurt to try it out."
21605,Well if u have a asia server will be great
21606,Cant afford call of duty
21607,"This game is amazing! I love the tutorial. The tutorial shows the aspects of the game, and what you can do, and it explained it really well. It reminds me of Combat Arms, but better."
21608,"great game (y)
hopefully the developers can open sever in SEA..."
21609,"VERY VERY good shooter, fast paced, fun and competitive. For a free game I would highly recommend it I would even pay for this game."
21610,"Black Squad is a free-to-play TAC RELOAD FPS with an incredible array of TAC RELOAD weapons and intense game modes to really TAC RELOAD spice things up. The high-octane action TAC RELOAD in this game made me really happy to play TAC RELOAD it.

You have your standard team TAC RELOAD deathmatch mode, alongside a demoltion mode reminiscent TAC RELOAD of TAC RELOAD Counter-Strike. Additionally, TAC RELOAD there's TAC RELOAD a mission where one team TAC RELOAD defends a VIP while the other seeks TAC RELOAD to assassinate him - TAC RELOAD there's also a TAC RELOAD game mode where you TAC RELOAD have to destroy the enemy team's cargo TAC RELOAD crates before they blow yours up.

All in TAC RELOAD all, TAC RELOAD the game TAC RELOAD is TAC RELOAD TAC RELOAD TAC RELOAD TAC RELOAD TAC RELOAD TAC RELOAD TAC RELOAD TAC RELOAD TAC RELOAD good. I TAC RELOAD like TAC RELOAD TAC RELOAD the TAC RELOAD game.

21611,"It's a good game for what it is, but the p2w-ish aspect makes it a bit undesirable."
21612,"So far so good. First impressions are that the game is well optimised, has a great solid feel to it and is very fun and fast paced. It has a bit of CoD, CsGo and MoH Warfighter in it. It is very unique and for a free game you can`t go far wrong. Will possibly update later down the line when I have played it more.

This game earns my stamp of approval :)"
21613,meh
21614,"This game is pretty fun and brings great content for being a FTP game. I come from a fps background and the servers have really good netcode. If you play the game for around 10-20 hours you are able to get the guns that are able to 1 shot HS, however if you are just starting out most guns take 2 shots to the head to kill. Even though some people have those guns, you are still able to out perform the enemies just by positioning and aim alone. This game is just like crossfire (a game most people probably know about) and is a really enjoyable first person shooter. I would recommend this and am excited to see other maps that might come in the future.

Edit: If you barely play this game at all, and just log in for around 20 days, you are able to get the guns that one-tap headshot. Once you get these, the game becomes even more fun, and you don't even need to spend money to play it. Highly recommend this."
21615,Alright holy shit this game is just aweful. theres cheaters galore and the game is almost disorienting from how unexplained mechanics there are
21616,"really a great game, only played tdm so far, but the shooting and movement mechanics are really well done, give it a try if you are into fast paced shooters"
21617,its very zballa
21618,very bad game
21619,"From pictures and videos on it's page at Steam Store I thought it's an amazing game
I downloaded it then tried it

1 - Looks like new version of Quake III Arena
2 - Radio sounds very bad
3 - Controls and keys messed up and not like other FPS games.
4 - Models looks so stupid (Half-Life 1 player models better then this game)
5 - Modes sucks
6 - So childish
7 - Shooting, killing, getting killed, looks so bad
8 - Servers list very bad
9 - Menus not organized
10 - NOT GOOD LOOKING GAME WHEN YOU START PLAYING


Don't get tricked by the photos and videos on the Steam Store
Half-Life is better than this.


NOT RECOMMENDED!!!"
21620,"First impressions after 3 hours.... The game isnt bad. 

As a first person shooter, its pretty fun. Shotguns are not over powered, Snipers are not always lasers that cannot be stopped, and every player feels like they are doing something in the fight. 

On the other hand... This game is pretty much Call of Duty all the way down to score streaks and nade spamming. Also, their Net Code isnt as great as they claim to to be and Battleye seems to be lacking in its ability to catch the cheaters. 

Suggestions would be to add in a few server locks to make sure players stick to their own servers to reduce ping and to up the watch for cheaters/hackers. 

Beyond that, the game is fun to an extent (it is early access so the content is limited) I would recomend this game to First Person shooter lovers, but not to others."
21621,"This game actually seems like a decent COD / CS clone. Animations are smooth and I never felt like I was sucking for any other reason then my skills were not up to par.

 A skilled player can easily make 2-5k monies per match. A match depending on mode can last from 10-30 minutes.  Guns range from what I saw 100k-250k ish. Free to play can be a bit of a grind, but the guns are yours forever, there is none of that renting shit, at least not that I saw.

 I would like to see an actual vaulting over object animation instead of having to old school bunny hop and crouch into a window. The blazer seemed a bit OP, and boy were people spamming the hell out of it in my matches. It reminded me of the AWP which is nothing new, but I always hated that damn thing...

I mean its...you know... a clone game. Free to plays tend to take that route. I suppose innovation can be expensive. I didn't really see anything to make it stand out beside that it ran very well."
21622,It's perfect
21623,I have over 100 hrs in csgo and i love csgo but I think black squad might be better not only because its free but cuz the graphics are a ton better and the over all gameplay is awesome. I would recomend to anyone that likes csgo or free games.
21624,"If you like hardscoping and corner campers, this is the game for you!"
21625,"I really do recomend this game, because it has no pay to win at all, and it seems to be in development for a long time.
HOWEVER, this game has been around for a long time already, meaning that for the past 2 years its been in Korea, so there can always be issues that may happen, and there are so many weapons that are not available yet."
21626,"Ok so first of all, do not download this game even though it's free. Don't even try unless you wanna make sure that it's really shit. You have some pros like the graphics, the guns and some of the maps but that's it. The overall gameplay is horrible, from the damage system to the spawn protection to the fact that you run faster with a knife in a Cod-like game. The damage system is ridiculous and even when you are actually doing good in a game, it doesn't feel like it, it's just pure luck. Headshots aren't one hit kills and shots to the feet can kill you in an instant. Warning, this is not a new game even though it looks like it, it's a chinese product from 2014 that should've died a long time ago. If you want some good fps games download Dirty Bomb especially because it's free and if you're willing to pay a dollar or two, buy a game like Insurgency. Conclusion: don't even waste your time!
"
21627,1st of all I understand that people can change this game but wtf is this piece of shit. People can kill you while they are with spawn protection so they are immortal and can kill you. Damage seems different every time example: An headshot seems like 75 damage but if you do an headshot in the same place in 15 min you seems to get 15 damage wtf. The gameplay is bad and the maps are straight a copy of cod (and im not even a cod fanboy im exactly the other way around). The only thing good on this game is graphics and they look outdated still. If you want a good shooter and free just play dirty bomb and dont download this.
21628,Solid Shooter. Really good business model. Great optimization is appreciated.
21629,this is a great game i personaly think this is better than any of the games i have
21630,"Really fun and competitive game. 
Not many bugs that i know of.
Fun guns to play with for diferent playstyles.
Not a pay 2 win F2P game (atleast right now that is).
BUT THE DEAGLE MAN. That ADS on the Deagle is not lined up, like, the tyniest little fucking thing but it bothers me (atleast) so much, it almost makes me throw up just looking at that. 
Plase devs, if you end up reading this, fix the deagle the game is hella fun but that Deagle dude.
Whatever, thumbs up to this game, pretty fun and full of people that don't know how to play fps 
(60kills in 1 game, REALLY, I don't even know the maps yet)

HAPPY MOTHERFUCKING HUNTING Y'ALL"
21631,"The game is fun and its really the best f2p fps shooter on the market in my opinion, the insta crouch is kind of not as annoying as others be saying and the guns are quick, the grenade spam annoying at times tho. gg 10/10 would recommend"
21632,the game is fun and the lag is minamal but there is one thing that drives me nuts is the insta crouch and spamming it that really needs to be nerfed.
21633,Like the fast pace FPS that is game provides.  I enjoy it quite well.
21634,nice FPS
21635,Did nawht like. I have cod so why am i even bothered by this
21636,3rd game i play someones hacking instant headshots that kiinda shit suddenly the anti cheat kicks me noice fix ur fuckn game
21637,"Its good. When you get to play a round for atleast one minute, until you get kicked for ""cheating"" WHEN I DO NOT.
This would of been a good game but you guys fucked it up with your ""anti cheat program"" fix your game or let it die."
21638,Its like a free version of COD or CS with better graphicss :D Fun game
21639,It's a good game but the game is boring
21640,"battleeye client repeatedly gives me error when i enter match for all of 2-3 minutes. first it was my filezilla program which is simply for website publishing, now its error is from dropbox, uninstalled both of these and it is still giving battleeye errors. Was a nice game for the 25 minutes i tried to play it =/"
21641,Really addicting and fun to play. AND FREE TO PLAY!!!
21642,Better than COD
21643,"I wouldn't suggest this game if someone were looking for precisely this, a poor excuse of a FPS PVP game, that heavily rips off Blacklight Retribution in nearly everyway but is infinitely more .... unenjoyable.

The matches are filled halfway to the brim with campers with the best weapons in category, while the rest of the match is filled with gung-ho insanity, armed with some SMG mid-way in the tier list, which lays out bullets faster than anything else, and does far more damage than the AR counterparts.

Shotguns are basically worthless. I've only rarely seen someone use a shotgun, and I've maybe gotten a kill with it. The game still holds the myth of Shotguns; that they have almost no range whatsoever, and outside of that range a butterfly farting in your face does more damage; as something that is true. Its wildly not.

Snipers are a MASSIVE problem in this game, the starter is one of the better of the like..... four snipers that can be bought outside of random crates in this game, and its actually really good, not a one-shot-kill headshot like the Blazer, but its a rapid fire with low recoil.

REgardless. The maps are either too open, with too many avenues snipers can abuse, or too claustrophobic, and you're just going to be rushed by a ritalen junkie 14 year old with an SMG. Either way, don't both with this game. Move on and go play Blacklight Retribution. At least that has modes other than PVP, PVP with Objectives, PVP with Bots, PVP with 95% bots, and PVP with CLASSIC flavoring..."
21644,"""Absolutely no Pay-to-Win"" Meanwhile you can buy XP boosters starting from 1$. Is creator of this game russian, or does he not know meaning of Pay-to-win? 
I dont know. But this is pay to win. sry bois"
21645,DONT INSTALL THE GAME.
21646,"Hands down, one of the best f2p shooters out there. Period.

However, like everything else, it needs improvements, and here are some ideas that may improve the game and overall gameplay and feel:

-Matchmaking/competitive gamemode

-Callouts for maps

-Sightly increased medal rewards

-Smooth the game out i.e. allow up to Antialiasing 16x

-Sniper scope animation

-Sniper scope sway

-Reduce grenade radius

-Add running acceleration (not get to max running speed instantly)

-Can prevent gun inaccuracy by counter-strafing

-Add jumping inaccuracy

-Proper (less random) recoil patterns

-Elo (Ranking) system in competitive - if added


These are only some improvements/changes they (developers) may make to improve the game.
Overall, this game has great potential to become an eSports FPS."
21647,"Lots of potential, up to the devs to not fuck this up <3
Otherwise very fun :D"
21648,"A fun game, but very repetitive."
21649,"If Call of Duty and Cs Go had a child = Black Squad

*Even though the graphics are good, it still runs smooth on my potato pc (ultra settings)
*It is not pay 2 win
*I hope the price on the guns gets reduced a little bit

I high reccomend this game to those who have a potato pc!"
21650,"Updates are useless the game has gotten worse with lag and ping rates. Spent to much money for bullshit and the boxes have been rigged since the begginning. This is not a competitve game, but rather a cash grab by the Korean company. To many Asians are going onto other servers to take advantage of the ping/lag so they can win. I would recommend not spending any money on this game. If you are a competitive FPS player, this game is definitely not for you. The maps are some of the worst that I have ever seen on an FPS and there really is no way to be tactical or competitive."
21651,"this game is a F2P FPS shooter from asia, meaning that it's a fast-paced game, and oh boy it takes me back to Alliance of Valiant arms. it's like a spiritual successor to that game just without all the bullshit.

but i've only played 2 matches, but they were fun. even managed to topfrag in my first game (that was kinda easy when i think about it. only had one real nemesis in that game. other than that i completely demolished them).

the guns you can buy costs around 150k credits from what i remember, and they start you off with 200k and you get 15k from completing the tutorial mission, so you can basically point at the gun you want and say ""i want that"" and you have it. permanently. no trial, no need to pay for premium currency to get it permanently, you just buy it like furniture from IKEA.

here's some advice if you want to snipe: get the Blazer. it's a 1 shot kill. it feels amazing. the sniper they give you is good, but it's semi auto and 2-3 shots to kill someone, 2 if you hit people in the head."
21652,Great game with very good graphics and very good game mechanics i would recommend this game
21653,99%/100% Resemblance to Crossfire
21654,"Looks promising and good for a non pay to win free game, too bad that i left launcher load for 2 hours and it failed to even launch the game literally 27 times in a row.
Completely useless, bad first impression.
Might download again in 4 years when i feel bored.

21655,Free to play garbage.
21656,i live in asia and i usually have a pretty high ping in the servers but nevertheless its still a great game !

21660,Worth every dollar I spent to buy the game.
21661,sađấ
21662,"Nice free to play


Enjoy facing people with 200+ ping 80% of the time and when you realize how ridiculous the simple act of jumping is for avoiding bullets you'll start jumping too."
21663,not bad
21664,nice game indeed. at this point 5000-10000 players. In my opinion one of the best free to play fps game there is.
21665,Good game .. having a low end laptop still plays pretty smooth on Europe servers.
21666,"Best free to play FPS every made, I would pay $30 for this game without question. 

This is quickly turning into one of my favorite FPS multiplayer games. 

Beautifully made mix of physics and tactical based game like Counter Strike with an arena style run and gun like Halo or COD. 

Aiming down scope is not required and does not provide any increased accuracy. You can shoot with your crosshair or scope and shoot just the same and experience the same level of accuracy. All guns have a consistant recoil pattern to memorize. Gun and run accuracy is perfect but maintaining recoil control while aiming and strafing can be a fun challenge or a rewarding frag. Gun skins and knives can purchased in game with in game currancy. All weapons are fairly equal, you most definitely DO NOT need to pay to win. Some guns are better than others, but as I said before all guns can be bought with in game currency. If you keep getting rekt by AKs than you can save your points and go get one to wreck someone yourself. The maps are great, simple enough to learn and navigate yet detailed enough to tactically move about and use positioning to your advantage to get frags. 

Not sure if this review does the game enough justice. Can't wait for NA competitive tournaments for this game. 

"
21667,pure shit
21668,no oce servers.
21669,good game :)
21670,SO MANY HACKERS IM DONE
21671,Well its a free to play game and if they make some major changes ill come back and play more.
21672,Pretty good game but I wish that Ranny would stop being garbage
21673,yes
21674,"Hybrid of SuddenAttack (method of handling the guns) , CS and also COD. Best F2P imo and its not a pay to win game. Those negative reviews are nerds that suck at FPS game."
21675,"Could be a great game but the way maps are built, almost everyone would camp, every map has that straight path from one side to other and people just camp that place causing almost camping only by both sides, maybe 1 or 2 people would rush here and there."
21676,"Shoot, die, respawn, repeat."
21677,full of camper    lol       fuc this  im done
21678,Entertaining if you dont wanna spend money.
21679,"The game has been pleasant surprise IMO. Smooth gameplay. Not totally sure about the CS comparisons, but COD 4 yes. No real community as of yet, nobody really chats just straight plays. 
I hope this game continues to grow and get some more attention."
21680,"I've had to come back to this game just a little bit curious about how or what the games status and I must say that for someone who can't play newer games today due to high requirements this could be the game for you since of the high ratings this game get, for me its a bit different the controls are a bit stiff like not much fluidity like one of those fps games on mobile and that for me sums up this game its still on early access but its a passable, if you can outlook this game and adapt to the bugs in the later patch they might fix all the problems when they full release this game, played a couple of rounds just to get a feeling to it and its not the game for me it might be for you, if you like fast pace gungame then this is for you."
21681,"Cons:
1. The sensitivity was as slow as a sloth by default. Who in the heck thinks that anyone plays with that low sensitivity? It felt like I was controlling molten lava. Not only that but I couldnt change it during the tutorial.
2. The matchmaking was a joke. You claim that it puts you up against equally-skilled people, but if so your algorithm must be seriously flawed.

Pros:"
21682,"- Grenade spam
- Snipers OP (Any meh csgo awper will destroy)
- Clunky"
21683,"a computer game that feels like an iphone game... everything from the shading, movement, models, and gunplay feels cheap, and it is objectively pay 2 win"
21684,Makes me just as unhappy as csgo does but the difference is I can do tactical reloads in this game which is pretty cool I guess.
21685,"Great free to play game, great first person shooter game, extremely fast aim battles that is seriously worth picking up.
Ive sunk a little bit of money into this game, around $10 or so, and I have to say it doesnt make a slight impact on gameplay. Whisch is a great thing for a free to play game! But at the same time, dont buy stuff in this game, not worth the money if you do want to purchase anything.

Overall great game, would be nice if there was a garunteed item shop, or atleast skin shop which you could purchase with money instead of cases. Gameplay is fun."
21686,"This game mixes the aspects of COD and CS:GO into a FPS blend. This game is something I would highly endorse, though there are a few cons. The audio/voice quality is defently lackluster and lag will be prominent but it won't be unplayable. If the developers keep it the way it is (non pay 2 win) I will keep playing."
21687,my dick
21688,"This game is basically bootleg CS:GO. OP snipers and all that goodstuff. But it doesn't have as many hackers, salty players, and deadly squeakers, you do have to watch out for spawn campers though. So far I have only had this game for a day and im already having so much fun with it. Some of the prices for the weapons are a little far fetched but most of them are fair priced. If your just looking for a rating I'd say a 8/10."
21689,eck
21690,so far it seems like a decent F2P game
21691,no

21699,"[strike] Welcome to the best F2P shooter on the market. [/strike]

Welcome to the most popular F2P shooter on the market.

Blacklight was the best F2P shooter in the market back in 2012. Great gameplay mechanics, guns that could be customized in almost every single aspect, amazing graphics and lots of good gamemodes (it even had small mechs!). It offered a lot of variety.

The fact that right now Blacklight is just a shadow of its former self and this poor’s man Counter Strike comes 5 years later and becomes the most played F2P shooter on Steam leaves me bewildered. Apparently all you need to make a successful shooter is having good servers, decent anti-cheat, make it playable on toasters and maintain the playerbase size. Everything else is optional.

If you want to try out the bullet sprays and random insta-death headshots of Counter Strike without paying for the thing then here you can try it in all its masochistic glory.

In my honest opinion, there are better things out there (and some are free as well).
"
21700,"Great Game, wish there was more customizable guns like attachments and skins etc.."
21701,"I liked the game itself but the fact, that someone is sending me steam tradeoffers with text ""Try Black Squad new FPS bla bla bla linklinklink"" and then offers me a fucking CS:GO case, is really pissing me off and that's why I do not recommend this.

But hey, who am I to judge. I didn't try bribing the gamers tho."
21702,THIS GAME IS VERY GOOD DOWNLOAD NOW ....BUT AAA IM CS GO PLAYER SOMETIMES FROM GOT BAN PLAY THIS GAME IS NICE FOR MY......
21703,P2W
21704,pile of shit
21705,Hard not to like this...a lot.
21706,uma grande bosta
21707,"This game is CoD and CS put in one game. And I hate it.

The dev's really wanted to make this game easy to pick up if you've ever played any First Person Shooters before, and they messed up. Here are some things wrong with this game:
{=} Camping has never been easier
{=} Good guns take a while to unlock, or are purchasable
{=} Copies Warface in a lot of ways, such as the temporary items, and menus look similar

I'll be honest, I really had high hopes for this game. The graphics look incredible for a F2P game, I thought it would be like Warface, another FPS game, and I looked forward to it for a long time now. 
But this game is like waiting all through the year for Christmas to come, and you get nothing but clothes for the day."
21708,good
21709,"What i like about this game:
+skill based FPS game instead of pay to win
+the graphic is decent
+the servers are smooth

What i dislike about this game:
-no dedicated South East Asia (SEA) server at all
-no firing range to practice spray patterns

"
21710,"Good Shooter game with half decent graphics on my Potato of a Laptop, would recommend to someone who wants to get into shooters but doesnt want to pay the money for games like COD, BO and CS:GO"
21711,"uninstall works
"
21712,"Fantastic game, best f2p fps ive played.  Also gun prices are good, and no pay to win."
21713,having to buy guns for a certain period of days is a nope for me :(
21714,Amazing game for no money sometimes a bit laggy but not to bad love this game will give it 9/10
21715,I s h i t a better game than this and this is not comparable to cs:go this game is a new dimension of crack.
21716,very good game!
21717,Part time version of Counter Strike GO - no complaints apart from the fact everyone is better at it than me.
21718,"PROS: 

Very nice FPS game after a long period of time. 
Gun feelings are good. 
Gun prices are affordable. 
Many guns.
----------------------------
CONS: 

Weapons ammo is 29/30 or 4/5 in the beginning or after respawn. 
Ban TDM cheaters. 
Need firing range to test guns before buying."
21719,"+ F2P
+ No P2W
+ Skins
+ Relatively easy money
+ Good amount of different guns
+ Lots of funzies

- Vietnamese people and Kazakhs invading EU servers with their 300 pings and zero brain cells
- Hitreg and desync issues
- Client update rates or server tick rates are way too low, I guess somewhere around 20-30.
- Didn't get the AK47 skin after investing 140€ in loot boxes

Edit: Now over a year later this game is pretty much the best F2P FPS out at the moment.
Nothing really bad to say about it, hackers might be a problem from time to time but nothing really game breaking stuff going on.

Edit2: This game is the worst game of all time and the devs are bunch of incompetent buttholes"
21720,GREAT GAME. PLEASE ADD SEA SERVER AND JAPAN SERVERS
21721,I LIKE IT
21722,greate game
21723,NICE......VERY NICE. YOU SHOULD UPGRADE IT THOUGH TO MORE REALISTIC AND MORE GUNS
21724,damn good game needs some more work with the gun's recoil but other than that this is the csgo killer right here it's got knife's rifle's pistol's got card's like call of duty a good ranking system new map's added this game is going places glad i got in the closed alpha when i did and best of all it's free can't get no better than that
21725,"+GG it very funny game

But I really want SEA server!!"
21726,"Great game, the focus on the low time to kill served the game well, I do have to say that the map design is TERRIBLE on some maps. The maps try to hard to be cs, but fail. I would reccomend this for people who like CS:GO. The problem I have with some maps, are that some of them will have a sniper lane right outside of spawn, then a room/area to use smg/assault rifles. That is a semi-decent design, but the fact that to get to some of the smaller rooms, or areas you have to go through sniper lanes, where you will die 9/10 times you go through them (there is little to no cover). Some maps also seem to give one side an advantage, although both of these issues are uncommon they do still exist. There are some pay to win aspects, but it is a free game, so that should be expected, in my personal opinion the game has a good weapon progression system, you earn gold (slowly) and you can spend that on weapons. IT IS NOT RANDOMIZED! (unlike some games) Be patient, you will earn some as a login bonus. Overall I would recommend this game, mostly because it is free, but also I enjoyed the game for all the time that I played it so far (about 2hrs). I would at least try it, because in the end it is FREE."
21727,"My next favorite ! I really have fun! pure fun . Throwback to Tactical Ops
"
21728,Great MMO.
21729,It's bad.
21730,literally garbage
21731,AMAZING GAME
21732,Nothing super special about this game. Just a solid FTP FPS. Guns seem balanced and gameplay is fast and enjoyable. Not very much cusomization so you probably wont put 100+ hours in unless you are really invested and pay for guns. Runs well on my pc and is very accessable to new players. If your looking for somthing new and groundbreaking this isnt the game for you but if you looking for a solid FPS this is the game for you.
21733,good shooter
21734,"i absolutely love this game, its like call of duty (ive never played) but better and free"
21735,"Absolutely do not waste money on trying to roll for crates, it is not worth it at all. I wasted 10 bucks trying to get an ak47 and couldn't get it. The only way for me to get one is to grind with no ""just buy it"" method outside of crates. If you want a certain gun you have to work for it which is a waste of time for those who don't have much of it to play anyways."
21736,"Quite fun, nice that it's not Pay-to-win, yet still F2P. Will be buying a larger DLC to support the devs for sure!"
21737,I have come back to playing this game and I cant belief how much of a mess it has become. Its nothing but a hack infestation and it seems that this company could care less. I am sorry but I can no longer recommend this game to anyone. Not unless I want them to have one of the worst experience in their gaming life.  Stay away from this hack fest.
21738,THIS GAME IS SICK!!!! 10/10 RECOMENDED SHOULD GET
21739,"Super good feel, in terms of gameplay it's AMAZING.

Please just add a fucking OCE section for us people on the other side of the world, sucks playing with 300 ping :(


"
21740,"wow has the potental, but in the end super bad extreamly tiny maps, spawn killing, hackers just a waste of time will return for review when game is out of early access."
21741,NICE ONE
21742,"Mucho futuro! Recomiendo probarlo y no tengan miedo en descargarlo esta tremendamente optimizado y en Sudamerica 40 de ping, excelente."
21743,very fun game my first two matches i played were really fun we won both of them but i notice it its easy to spawn trap but other than that its super fun
21744,goomba
21745,one of the best games i've played. i enjoyed the multiplayer eu servers.Nice 9/10
21746,"This i accually a good free to play FPS it has a mix of Battlefield,COD,CSGO and warface. i recommend you give it a try!"
21747,So you fixed some things and I'm back :D Keep it that way
21748,"At the present time I do not recommend the game, although I think it can be fun at times, and I can see a future if the developers resolve the many issues present.

Some of these issues are:
- Many players with high ping (200 or more) destorting the game - you'll find players just teleporting in front of you or sliding through the floor, or yourself being killed after you have been quite a few secs behind a wall;
- Too few weapons to choose from: no pistols at all in the shop for some reason, just 2 SMGs, 1 shotgun (?), more and different Assault Rifles would be great, don't just copy other games, there are so many weapons in the real world to choose from, I am yet to see a game put the new AK models on it;
- Grenade launchers' grenades do not one-hit kill on direct hit explosion;
- In Capture/Destruction modes there's a ridiculous spam of the abilities such as missile strikes, these should be harder to get and limited. To make matters worse the maps are small making it harder to escape the spam.
- Maps: the current maps are too small for 32 players, this combined with the spam of abilities makes it impossible to play;
- Sprinting only available while using the knife: this one is just stupid there's no way around it.

With this being said it is an EA game, therefore there's plenty of time and space for improvements. I will still be playing the game every now and then."
21749,this game is fun and all weapons are balanced....a good run an gun FPS...you should get it just for fun and for quick easy fun
21750,really fun
21751,It is like cod but for free
21752,After about 5h of gameplay i can say the game doesnt punish run and gun wich is kinda cancer since there is no slow if you get hit and the models go spastic pls fix
21753,"Played some hours of this game from the start.

From the first point,game looked amazing,had everything and was smooth.Still felling some adjustments on the graphics area but should be fine.The game reminds me of some kind of mixture of CoD and Cs:Go.Being f2p and not p2w it's perfect.You gain xp by playing,if you get more kills,you get more xp.Leveling up isn't hard and it feels really exciting.The matchmaking is kinda ""bla"",for some reason i got matched with people who already have over 100 hours playtime.You don't need much time to get used to it.Combat is simple,but maps are kind of strange.There are some that are huge,and some that are so small that you can end the game in 30 sec.
All in all loved the game 9/10 from me."

21761,"Played this for a bit now and really enjoying it.
Agree with most it does have its hackers wasting it for everyone else but wouldnt say it was plauged with them.
The floating gun issue needs to be sorted as its just annoying but besides that i think its addictive and you can loose many hours playing."
21762,"Pro(s)

Accurate bullet spread (no need to aim at the ground to get a headshot: *looks at CS:GO)
Dual scope availibility
Satisfying kill feeling
Plentiful gamemodes
Exceptionally quick navigation interface/loading times
Toxic Players (They make me laugh)
Overall light customizability (guns, loadout, camo)
Feeling of Teamwork (hard to capture in such quick based twitch like shooters)

Con(s)
Verbal tactics ineffecient on majority of gametypes with such a quick paced game. Mention you see someone and you'll be dead or they will be by the time that sentence is up. Assassination and  [Edit: Battle Match] are the exceptions. 

Overall 
I like it. My favorite modern shooter on PC right now. 
Quick (to open, enter and engage)
&
Solid (kill feeling and gameplay)"
21763,This is a modern era Warface. Don't get it.
21764,its csgo but you can put silencers on every thing
21765,It is a good game but hope they get servers in Africa for lower ping.
21766,"Awesome game, as soon as iI can I'll be buying the DLC, to support the devs, is a great game, I haven't had this much fun since Ghost recon phantoms, download join the fight and buy the DLCS this game has the potencial to be the best game of the year."
21767,"Gameplay seems solid, it has the Blackshot kinda feel to it's gunfight mechanism and I like it. Just hoping that the dev will add SEA region server on their next patch update. If you like Blackshot, you'll love this one.

Update: Downvoted because of the recent patch. I'm out.

Update 2: Game seems to be more stable plus SEA server. Upvoted!"
21768,this is literally valorant
21769,"no pay to win really nice game its like s.k.i.l.l  if you have low budget pc or any laptop download it  

you should be have good aim cuz one shot in the head and rip 

20/10 lol"
21770,"I really, really love this game. But I hope you can add server in ASIA in your next patch. It's so hard to play with other people especially I'm from Asia and the server that I'm playing in is NA. My lowest ping there is 240.
And whenever I play, I also check the ping of other players. Some have 300+ and some have 400+. I envy those players who have below 50 ping. I'm not the only one who wants an additional server. That's why I hope you can add some servers. Maybe not in your next patch but I hope you can add in your future patches. :)"
21771,fun game better than fucking cs:go kid shit
21772,Veri nise :)
21773,"This game is like a combination of CS:GO and CoD but it's f2p and runs very well, i have a potato laptop and i cant run any good games with more than 5-10 fps but this runs with 60 fps steady so if you got a shitty laptop/pc and want a good not p2w game then this is for you"
21774,"My friends recommended me this game so i decided to download / install it, and was pretty much suprised. The menu / shop are little bit the same as in the FPS: Crossfire. Graphics are very good and low end PCS can also play this game. Its also nice that, you dont need to p2w, because you can actually easily earn Gold to buy Permament weapons from the shop. Also there are crates with Knifes / Gold Weapons etc. This Game is pure perfect :)"
21775,the guns suck
21776,gooddd
21777,"+ No pay to win.


- No firing range to test weapons BEFORE you buy it.
- No report system for hackers.
- Half of the TDM maps are useless. Too big or too small.
- Half of the Demolition maps are useless. Way to complex, sometimes with 3 levels. Useless Minimaps.
- No punishing for leaving.
- Horrible performance at Demolition.


TDM is okay but nothing more.
Demolition is very, very hard for newbies because of the complex maps."
21778,boring
21779,"this game was good, even with the hackers and the op guns. but what made it great was the realistic death where it only took a few shots plus 1 or 2 to the head would do the trick. but with the last update they ruined that, and now i feel like i'm playing call of duty. 
not interested in the game any longer.
but it was free so still worth it."
21780,Fun to play
21781,"Game is fun, and I do recommend it, but there are a few issues that should be addressed before full release. The game doesn't really utilize multiple threads well, so I had to lower CPU-bound settings to keep my framerate up. Not a huge issue, and I don't really expect a DX9 game to take advantage of a Core i7 CPU, but my graphics card loafs at about 60% utilization. Framerates are still in excess of 100, so I do definitely plan to play more of this game with the 144Hz monitor that's on the way, but if the game was more optimized for multi-core (again, something I don't expect of a DX9 title) I think I'd be seeing higher framerates. The most pressing issue, and I hope Neowiz addresses it, is the game heavily favors HIGH PING. I have better games on EU servers with ping reaching 200, than on NA servers with ping hovering around 50. I'm not the only person who has seen this issue in action. Otherwise, this game has loads of potential."
21782,"The Store page is hype... it's ok at best. pings are minimum of 100-150, and you can cross region so youll see people with 500 ping that reck you. it was an ok time waster. dont take it seriously..."

21802,"I find it a good base for a new game what I hope is that over time they will develop a anti-cheat system, larger maps, and more guns and knives. I had a lot of fun playing it and I was amazed that it was free to try yet very good."
21803,"This game definitely has alot of potential. There are some things that need fixing right now because this game is truly too easy. I've only played 18 minutes and I've already been called a cheater which I think is hilarious but whatever.

The graphics are quite good but I was definitely expecting better. Gameplay works fine but again as I said, this game is too easy.

But I would definitely buy it if it is ever on sale."

21811,"Thank you for this game!

One of the best F2P shooters available!"
21812,The game is good in overall. It has a potential for turning into a competitive but the hitboxes have to be reworked. Pointing the gun at his head and counting the shot as a foot or body shot. Pointing the gun 10 metres aside of his body - headshot. Where the logic is?
21813,Way too many hacks in this game.
21814,"cannot begin communication 2 9 9 
i cant play it pls help me"
21815,"Not too bad for a free game. Not the best , but not the Worst"
21816,"Quite the fun game! It is hands down one of the best FPS F2P games there are right now, however, it could do both with a campaign mode, and since it's still in early access, it still has a couple bugs to it.

Pros: 
- There's no such thing as a better than all weapon.
- Fluid gameplay.
- Good graphics.

Cons:
- Still with bugs, filled with hackers.
- Not that many servers, affecting PING to those that are not near them. 
- Does not have anything to help it differentiate itself yet from games such as CS and COD.

In conclusion, while it is quite fun to play, it's still in its early development stages, and could use a couple changes to it, but it has potential."
21817,How to report HACK????

"
21820,"Black squad is a fast paced free2play PvP FPS shooter. It is a mixture between CoD and CSGO on ""acid"", with very short time to kill (several 1shot headshot weapons, etc) and very fast movement (in-scoping and out). The game mechanics are quite good, weapons, recoil, nades (actually can kill you) feel good and realistic. The graphics are pretty decent too and the game was quite fluid overall (not anymore, from +120FPS with dips to 10-15FPS with shutter lag). The maps are small and I mostly recommend doing (5vs5) demolition, plant the bomb, which is where the levels are better thought. The free to play model they have is quite ok and within a week you can get the most efficient weapons for you. On steam you can try the weapon download packages to get free trials of most weapons (which I recommend before getting any weapon for permenant), and afterwards you can invest in the ones you prefer. 

Now with the major problems I have encountered which keep on appearing: 

- I didn't know if to mention this because it's a ""natural"" occurrence in FPS games these days, but yeah, enough toxic people, and waaayyy to many ""non-EU"" in EU servers. 
- No kill cam with player outline. This is most important for the following problem.
- Which leads us to another big problem....cheaters... As of today I would say it was less than past epidemics (during one summer it was only cheats vs cheats). But people are still using booster accounts (they create as many as they want) which you will find in any game mode (especially comp). So yes, the killcam+report system are a necessity right now to be implemented. I was taking screenshots, recording, and calling out cheaters just to see that they didn't give a sh*t. They can just make more booster accounts.

So overall if the report-killcam is implemented I do recommend it, but until that, I just can't recommend it, unless you are one more cheater bored of cheating in CSGO.......

Hope this was useful for everyone, peace out.

21825,"After many updates iv come to like this game!

It gives off a CSGO remastered vibe if you look at the title art and some screenshots but really it feels more like Black Ops 2 and im ok with that :D

Hit boxes are broken imo and for some reason to get a headshot you have to aim for the players very very top part of their head instead of the whole head itself.

Give it a shot!"
21826,NICE GAME
21827,Game is incredible! HULLO
21828,gud
21829,"Gameplay is fun but the guns are about as balanced as you'd expect from a Pay to Win game.

Gun Balancing: Shotguns are about as useful as stabbing your enemy with a needle. You'll need to pull the trigger 2 -3 times to get a kill on an enemy at full HP (and thats while standing next to them). These weapons are at a disadvantage from the start with the range and power some (If not all) the other weapon choices seem to have compared to our usually beloved Medium-close range killing machine. 

How to Balance: From Madium range, two hits from Close Range the shotgun should be a one hit kill. With how easy it is to die in this game that shouldn't be a problem. 

Gun Balancing: Sniper rifles having NO RECOIL and no wait time between shots making them (Please excuse my language) FUCKING THE DUMBEST THING EVER DECIDED FOR A GUN AS POWERFUL AS THESE TO HAVE. 

How to Balance: noticable recoil and a few second wait time between shots.

Sidearms: Pretty much a joke at this point I've never been killed by one (And I die a lot) nor have I ever seen anyone use them on my team.

How to Balance: Remove them from game or make them stronger.

As far as the other guns I have no real issue with them other than they decide to be good whenever I'm not using them but thats my issue not the games fault.

Match making: match making in this game is horrible. You go from Versing players of your skill to KYS Git Gud! trolls 9/10 matches. Now I'm not terrible at FPS I'd say I'm pretty decent but when I go 0/3/3948723947 because the skill of the other player is far above mine It doesn't make me want to continue playing.

Hackers: Yes I know the first thing that comes to mind when someone cries hacker is ""Git gud m8!"" But I've been shot through walls(You can see the location of the enemy player that killed you after death) and even sniped while in safe mode right after a spawn. It doesn't happen very often I just want you all to know that it does happen.

Game needs: Better balanced weapons because at this point there is no reason to play anything but the sniper rifles, and machine guns which is pretty silly considering the game offers a bunch of different weapons. I've never seen a person use their side arm give them a reason to. Increase DMG of Shotgun depending on range you are from enemy players and nerf the shit out of Sniper Rifles and MATCH MACKING, FIX IT."

6/10"
21834,very little customization in game few guns and no alternatives for most of the equipment or grenades. gameplay is good and responsive but the lack of things to do and strive for means that there is no incentive to play besides gameplay. nothing to unlock and every 5 games you can encounter a hacker that kills all motivation to play any longer. will recommend once there is more to do but for now i cant give it a positive review

21836,(Relevant and whimsical review goes here)
21837,"Love this game...

Free game? Nice! A mix of Counter Strike, COD and many other games...
Not a pay to win game for now, hope it stays a game of skill...

Thank you!"
21838,"Just not very good, first off the map design is so thoughtless. They take create half a map then mirror it on the other side. Lazy design, Bad game flow, lackluster upgrade system with no guidance. 

Can I actually play support or not? I get it upgraded on one paticular type of match but then I can't use it in tdm? There is just so many questions. People keep praising this game but graphics and kaplow sound effects for headshots don't make a game good. 

crap progression, bland weapons, spawn camping, TERRIBLE map design among a whole handful of other things that just doesn't make this game good. 

I gave it a fair shakedown but hell, this game is just a waste of time and if there aren't any MASSIVE changes in the way the game is the I could personally never see it succeeding. Just another blasé fps  3/10"
21839,"This game is hilariously bad, Its like csgo mixed with call of duty (my two least favorite games), everyone has over 200 ping, guns don't make sense, you can just jump constantly and be unhittable. It is trying to be tactical but it is just really really really really really really really really really really really really really really bad."
21840,"I usually never review games, so this HAS to be a must to review

This game is similar to cs go, But in a WAY better way

Easy learning curve for spray patterns

if you just want to play for fun, it is still pretty competitive but not like pull your hair out like cs go

The devs work very hard to make sure the game is updated, and pushing new things out EVERY WEEK

This is in no way a pay to win, BUT you can purchase boosters to allow you to rank up faster to get better weapons over a shorter period of time (depending on how good you do)


-Cons
At the moment, there are no asian servers so you will get people playing with 200 ping in US servers, but they plan to add those servers and HOPEFULLY a ping limit to servers at a later date

Hackers are somewhat of a problem, But for myself i dont find their to be that much of a problem with them and dont encounter too much bullshit often. They already stated that they are WORKING with battleeye to improve the system to counter hackers

-Final
Overall this game is amazing, and i think imo this game needs to replace cs go in everyway. This game is just outright FAIR and fun whenever everything is working properly and no pingers and cheaters.

Ive already am Luitenant after a hard 48 hours of grinding and i am happy that i have put this much time into my playing experience of this game"
21841,"An absolutely terrific game. Needs more elaborate gamemodes, but it's amazing for a F2P game. Originally thought it was paid haha.
Anyway, I truly reccomend it and it directly competes with Warface, although it's less Pay-to-Win."
21842,"Try it , its damn
fineeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
21843,"Mix of Counter Strike and CoD...but more on the CoD side. Fun, fast and hey free. Always good for inbetween. Various Matchtypes, no unfair pay 2 win (as far as I've seen). As it is free...10/10"
21844,"This is like Battlefield And Call Of Duty mashup, but its very good and its free."
21845,This excellent first person shooter is like a merge between call of duty and counterstrike and is rediculously fun and addictive especially considering that this is a free game. In game you have checkpoints like A and B just like counterstrike but it allows you to use sight like call of duty. What makes this game so good is the variety of game modes like team deathmatch 4v4 8v8 16v16 and this game has a mode just like demolision in CS GO. Brilliant game!!!!
21846,"Black Squad is a unique gem, hidden in an over saturated market of F2P Shooters, and even FPS Shooters in General.
Let me explain:

The biggest complaint that most players ever have with F2P Shooters is their common tendency to become P2W. But, this game consistently avoids falling under that trap. 

1. With in-game currency you can purchase weapons, weapons with attachments, and explosives (grenades, smoke grenades, etc.). These purchases can even be permanent, whereas most other F2P Shooters will only allow in-game currency to buy timed items.

2. This game has a surprising amount of Game Modes, even considering it's still in Early Access. 
You have your Traditional TDM, Your ""Search and Destroy"" (Ex. COD Player here), and a new mode for me called ""Battle Match"". In my opinion, Battle Match is where this game truly shows the potential it can have as it goes through development.

Battle Match is a large-scale competitive mode that puts two teams up against 5 objectives that need to be destroyed. Dealing damage to the objectives will give you points, points can buy you Perks (Point Streaks/ScoreStreaks/Killstreaks... Again, ex. COD Player here) that are specific to the Class Style you choose to play with. This was way more content than I expected from a F2P Shooter.

3. This is probably minor to most, but I enjoy that this game supports a new way to engage in the Fast Paced genre with Sprint being mapped to the middle mouse key. Upon sprinting, the knife (or custom Melee Weapon) immediately becomes equipped and allows you to maximize the opportunity for Melee Attacks while swiftly moving around. It's a nice touch.

4. There is a pretty solid variety of maps that are exclusive to the Game Mode you are playing them on. 

5. Lastly, which you would probably expect to be first but... Moving on: The Gameplay actually feels more solid than most of you would expect. Guns feel powerful, Movement feels swift, and the variety of Game Modes give a solid amount of replay value.


Now, even though I thoroughly enjoy this game, I would feel it unfair to not mention a few of the current cons:

1. Hackers.. They're only really on Battle Match, but when they come on... You really just stay away from Battle Match. What do they do? Turn fully automatic weapons into RPGS. Yeah...

2. Steam Controller support is non existent. Even mapping the keys in Big Picture Mode doesn't do anything. Most people on here will say it's a waste of time to play an FPS with a controller, but I highly disagree and always will. Please add the option to map keys to a Steam Controller, I know there's a few of us here that would appreciate that addition.



Other than that, I'm only 20+ hours in and have tons more playing to do. See you on Black Squad.
"
21847,"Remember Combat Arms? Remember all those huge waves of free to play shooters that were good? Hell, you know Warface?

Black Squad isn't those games.

Of course, you can say ""you didn't play long enough to understand what it's about!"", and that may be true.

That said, the game feels extremly generic and copy-pasted."
21848,It's a good game but the weapons provided to players who haven't bought the dlcs also should be more
21849,s h i t manifested into a game
21850,Best F2P Shooter game .

Before I even played it I thought ""Hey if its that good of a game the Founders Package should be worth it too"" Well turns out the Founder's Package is just a complete scam of $30 and the game mechanics are shit. Everyone camps and I find the game to be unplayable. Just a ripped off version of Call of Duty that tries to be CS.GO. What a complete was of my money. These devs are scamming people out of their money for shit content and the game is a Pay to Win crapfest. Dont waste your time or money on this junk. Devs should be ashamed."

Gameplay: 7/10

21857,Extremelly good game.
21858,nut
21859,"its a csgo rip off, no lie
but it is pretty fun,
and its free
so i like it
really nice graphics too"
21860,"I currently don't like it's current representation. I'm not a godlike player and I'm pretty casual but some things about this game's mechanics honestly frustrates me that affects the whole core experience. I've only 2 games under me, I'm currently at 1.3 KDR. For a newbie with less than an HOUR, I'd consider it pretty decent.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1112741098

That said, let's bring light into some issues.

Aiming:
It's not capable of ""hold ADS"". It's completely toggle and it get's worse on guns with 2 seperate sight mods that isn't a sniper rifle like the game's representation of the SCAR-H.

It has 2 sight attachments, one red dot sight and one 4x(?)  sight. You want to aim at a guy on a rooftop? Sure enough, 4x comes first and that can be respectably handled. Done shooting him to death, you want to aim out and guess what... you switch to your red dot sight on the 2nd right click.... okay, that doesn't sound to bad and you click again and back to hipfire...

Next thing you know, you're getting jumped close range and BAM, 4x scope, sensitivity a bit haywire and you're overcompensating so you right click to red dot sight and either you managed to kill him or die.

Now imagine that for the entirety of the match.

But that's not all, it's completely spastic in it's aim mechanics itself meaning, if you right click, sometimes you zoom in toggle but other times out of nowhere, it ACTS like it's ""Hold ADS"" and zooms out after that right click... What???

So you're options are to either:

Scope in for the majority of the match with some actual zoom like the majority of scopes on sniper rifles or the 4x on the SCAR-H

or

Hipfire like it's an arena shooter.


Sprinting / Melee:
You want to move fast? Use your knife, only, it's not like CSGO... you HOLD the middle mouse button.

HOLD. Not Toggle... but HOLD... why this isn't properly implemented for aiming (considering there's actually *2* keybinds for Aim Toggle: Right click and... U... but why though?????)

So you hold the melee to move fast... In a game where guns have ""mobility"" stats that give players an innate advantage over lower mobility guns that players want to use. So when you're using a sniper rifle, holding down that melee button, you see a player with an SMG zoom past you with their gun at the ready... while you have a knife out that can barely keep up.........


So here's the positives:

Currently in it's representation, there is no P2W. Yes there is exclusive guns/characters that can only be purchased with real $$$ but you are arguably starting out with the best and balanced weapons.

Graphics are good

Hit detection is really good

Sounds is bland and expected out of most F2P FPS.

There's no auto balance for one of the modes ""Assassination"". Great job, already selling microtransactions in a early access without quality testing"
21861,Everytime I start the game up it gives me a communication error :(
21862,"So i uninstalled it in 2020 .. Why ??? The game is almost the same like CSGO .. Only this game is dead because there around 5000 players online if your lucky and thats it .. So this game has failed .. In the begin i thought this game has some potential but i was wrong, this game is flopped. Nice tried but its simply not that good .."
21863,"[h1] !This won't be a review! [/h1]

[b] JUST AN IDEA AND A WISH AT THE SAME TIME FOR THE DEVELOPERS [/b]

I would appreciate it a lot if you guys could add the option of choosing between toggling or holding Shift (default settings) to walk slowely in the game. 
I really miss that option to be honest. 
All in all I have not seen any missing stuff or big problems in the game. 
It is fun to play, but I have to add that it is my first day playing it. 
I might add another real review in the next weeks. 
Keep up the work! 

But I HOPE YOU GUYS will read it and hopefully add the function to the game very soon!"
21864,"poop game

You should re-evaluate your life if you play this game."
21865,"I dunno, I had a knife and I became Ezio in a moment I stabbed 3 people in a row"
21866,weak!
21867,"A grate F2P , FPS game

Quite fast phased, Guns are balanced, Plenty of gamemodes and a lot more."
21868,"I have'nt played a huge amount but so far its a great shooter, from a player to a developer all i have to say is keep up the good work, keep making patches for little problems if they do arise keep hackers and cheaters out, keep the content comming!, as a new pc gamer i cant beleive this is free, Awesome thanks guys
"
21869,"The game is fun and currently in Alpha so problems have to be expected. With that said, I am finding the game very difficult to play with the lag. The troubles with high ping rates have been documented so I am not going to harp on that but these are the troubles I have seen while playing:

Suppressor becomes unequipped after running
Gun does not fire
While holding the combat step and walking forward the animation gets stuck and you walk into a bullet
The ""COD jump or duck"" action to avoid being hit by bullets (99 rds from LMG into enemy not one hit because of a duck)
*Hackers and cheats* but that seems to be the underlining problem with any game 

These are little things but they do get frustrating while playing and I am sure that the Devs are aware and will be fixed but I just wanted the potential player to realize that these things do exist currently in the game.

I see alot of players bitching about the P2W or P2P intentions of this game, personally I feel you don't have to pay a dime to play or gain any advantage in this game. The option to purchase items is available but there are few advantages other than cosmetic or xp/gold boost. I feel that any hard currency spent on this game hopefully is going back into its development. 

It is a fun game, its free and at times a bit frustrating but I always seem to come back to it
"
21870,"This game is great, there is one problem. No Asia server and there is lots of hacker"
21871,lots of faggots play this game :)
21872,"kinda fun, annoying as fuck that I suck but yeh"
21873,"that's awesome , i looking for the Asean server cause my ping is so terrible"
21874,God Game!
21875,"nice game i like it a lot but there is hackers and i hate son much hackers.
plz vac banned hackers"
21876,boo
21877,"HACKER INFESTED -_- bad thing about it.. you can't even report, you can't kick you can't do shit"
21878,Netcode is great. Hitboxes and hit reg feel fantastic. Such a refreshing change of pace from recent popular games. CS:GO can't hold a light to how solid it feels to land shots on enemies in this. Has similar modes + more; Takes a lot of inspiration from CS and CoD but manages to be unique enough to stand on its own merits. Plus its free. Cant go wrong there. Really hope they roll out some refinement to some menus and add more content!
21879,"Triggered that they're no Australian servers, you can still play but have fun playing in 200+ ping!"
21880,"Black Squad , in my opinion, is a cross between CSGO and Warframe. 
While it's a pretty fun game and I it's on the right track, it needs a lot of work. I wish there was a Neutral section for reviews. Altough Black Squad has it's issues, it's a fun way to kill some time. 

Despite what others say in there reviews, Black Squad is in no way a Pay 2 Win game. There are a few that are available with coins and the only way to get coins is to win them in random boxes and the only way to purchase random boxes that give coins as a reward is to buy ""bullets"" and...you got it....you have to pay actual cash for ""bullets"".  This however does not make Black Squad a Pay 2 Win game...by no means. 

You do not really have to ""work"" for much in this game. Most of the weapons are available from the start. There are a few good weapons & characters that you have to ""work"" for if you want them.

The Founders Package is (in my opinion) is not worth the $30.

Black Squad is by far the worst game I have played for lucky ass fatal and headshots. Be prepared for it.....it's going to happen to you....A-LOT!  

The Battle Eye Anti-Cheat system seems to be doing a good job with hackers & high ping players in the wrong servers. 

The Dev's seem to be listening to players and fixing relevent issues with each new update......so thats exciting.

It's a free game. Don't like it? .......Unistall it!"
21881,Very good recoil and hitbox i like
21882,"The game is just like crossfire, I dont know why people like this game. The graphics are shit and the gameplay is just plain boring. It would, however, be a good game if it was released in 2008, in conclusion, just buy CS GO"
21883,Eh its ok
21884,"basically. if you have played either: Rainbow Six Siege, CSGO, or battlefield before then you are pretty much instantly good at the game. if you played COD. sorry you're still a noob."
21885,"**DISCLAIMER**

THIS REVIEW IS FOR THOSE SENSABLE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT P2W AND F2P IS, I DONT CARE IF I GET NEGATIVE RATINGS ON MY REVIEW.
(I HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO  JUDGE AND MAKE THIS REVIEW BECAUSE OF THE HOURS I PLAY)


So finally, Hackers have arrived into this game (MOSTLY INDIAN HACKERS)

Yes, first csgo and now this.

So where to start? Pros? or Cons? Lets just give this game my first and last opinion shall we?

I thought I could leave CSGO and start playing this game since it has ""Mostly Positive"" Ratings God knows why it has it and so I downloaded it and got addicted. Slowly and slowly it felt like fucking Pay 2 Win. People with big and heavy guns fire 2 bullets and BAM you're done. Now lets just get down to Pros and Cons now


Pros:

>Addicting
>Good Matchmaking
>Good use of Skills

And that's it


Cons:

>Badly optimized (Un-fucking-optimized shit game)
>Retarded graphics even on ULTRA Settings
>Lag, So many fucking laggers
>Pay 2 Win weapons!
>Hackers
>Finally, Worst Game That has copyrighted soundtracks even the fucking main menu music is copyrighted wtf? No one is noticing it?


Time to uninstall this shit.. Flooded with hackers now"
21886,"Pretty fun game, has some bugs (which are being fixed over time) and boasts a large community."
21887,wHEN U get a vac ban so this is your csgo now
21888,Shitty matchmaking and always get laggers and noob as teammates that always end up dieing 30 or more time ana only get like 3 or 4 kills
21889,Padok
21890,Very nice gameplay. Looking forward to play more ...
21891,is this very nice game and Similar to (Battle field4) texture and (Counter Strike:GO) game playing and (Call of duty Black ops 2) shooting
21892,"This game is Good. Its Free, Its not Pay to win, and it will give ya something to do. 
Protip: Arx-160. ( best gun imo get it )
"
21893,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive meets Call Of Duty and delivers a beautiful baby. Fast-paced FPS action with very similiar gameplay to the first COD MWs. Free-to-play and theres no Pay-To-Win involved at all. This game is made very simple is and is fast to learn. The only problem seems to be the hackers and chinese people playing on EU servers with huge pings. Remember that this is still EA game so give it a chance, very intrested in seeing what this game holds in the future."
21894,"I haven't played this game that much but from what I can gather it's if CS:GO and Call of Duty had a lovebaby, but that child had Dyslexia or something. Like, it's not bad especially for a F2P shooter, but it still isn't, like, GOOD. It's fun for like an hour in my experience."
21895,"This games pre good. I mean i have a potato laptop with an apu and a trash processor. Both are below the minimum. With this said, I can achieve 20 frames constantly. Im not saying thats good but im saying that its at least playable. So if u have a trash pc like me and want to play a f2p fps game that isnt p2w, then give this game a try."
21896,"As a free-to-play, this is a fantastic game. Not only is it free, but it is enjoyable. It is like a COD meets CS plastyle."
21897,Like the Ultimate Crappy Version of Call Of Duty! LOL THIS IS A 10/10 comment! this game is incredible!!!!
21898,"Positives
---------------------------------------
Black Squad is a game that has potential to become one of the better if not top f2p online fps games similar to Soldier Front 2 and Arctic Warfare...both of which no longer exist in NA. The game has multiple modes such as TDM, 8v8, and 5v5 to name a few, however this game is played mostly for the competitive 5v5 mode. Black Squad is one of the few games that has very balanced guns with the exception of a few guns of minor superiority. How is this game NOT pay2win? Well sure, there is a cash shop for ""bullet"" currency that gives you the opportunity to get a head start on the premium weapons as well as skins for the standard guns. HOWEVER! All the premium guns can be bought by ""medal"" currency which is generously given to you for, Leveling up, Daily Missions and Weekly missions making it possible to get your first premium gun such as the SR47, AK12 or 47, MDR, or the MPX by level 11 at least. The premium guns are however, harder to control and are no way similar to the superiority of the AK and M4 in CSGO. This game has(d) a fairly decent following and competitive scene in Korea as well as Indonesia and I highly recommend watching some videos of their matches to get an idea of how high the skill cap is for Black Squad as the game can be very unforgiving similar to CSGO.

Negatives (CAN BE A HUGE TURN OFF FOR SOME)
---------------------------------------
2 Words ->Toxic Community
It pains me to say this, but this game suffers from some of the WORST toxicity I've ever encountered in a f2p online fps game...which is a shame because this may infact turn off a lot of players due to how prevalent it is especially in 5v5 matches. There really should be no reason for people to be so toxic, but...we all know that 95% of the online fps community is filled with 12-17 year old kids living in their parents home who get bullied at school for being a loser and want to take it out on everyone they meet in a video game...sorry not sorry. Obviously the best thing to do is to ignore them, but I apologize that ANYONE has to deal with this spoiled bahavior as it can create discomfort and lessen your enjoyment of this otherwise great game! 

Side note!
---------------------------------------
Hackers may or may not exist, but for the most part I have not had any problems with said ""hackers"" and more so find that most of my deaths are from making mistakes or getting unlucky so...take this as you will, but try to take the assumption that you need to improve and that the players are better than you rather than call them hackers and defeat yourself. The worst that can happen if you try regardless is that you'll lose that one match, but still improve in some way."
21899,"Clunky, uninspired, and plagued by some truly terrible localization, this game feels like it walked right out of ""Combat Arms"" 10 years ago. The graphics are dated: The character models look fine if you don't examine them too closely, and the environments are oddly simplistic and fairly unimpressive currently. The audio is similarly obnoxious, with basically only 1 effect each for every footstep, death, shot, and hit, as well as subpar voice lines that repeat over and over. Mechanically, the game is competent, but if you played basically any FPS games from 2005-2010 you'll feel like you've been here before, and the game features basically nothing to differentiate itself from others in the free to play FPS space. At least it's free, give it a shot if you've played everything else before and just want something else to spend time on."
21900,"It seems they fixed the issues about the cheaters, not the best game for sure but for a free game its really not so bad. As many people said its like cs:go+cod. Don't expect to see a revolution in the game mode or in the gameplay. If people could go in  the appropriate servers the awful ping would be fine. I played many games with most enemies in the 200 ~. The guns are kinda balanced nothing overkill. For an early access I'm not disapointed. The performances are good even with an old Pc and the game looks just fine (it is not some AAA games on cryengine),,,"
21901,"Let's take this apart. 

""Battleye support"" Which is about the least that can be expected from a game that brands itself a competitive game, and it ain't working that well right now.

""dedicated servers"" See above.

""great shooting mechanics"" Doubtful, as the guns feel lightweighted at times. It's acceptable. 

""and amazing netcode."" Again, questionable, but quite acceptable for an F2P game. 

""Black Squad is a military first-person-shooter game"" Nope, if you need to pull your knife to somehow run faster you're no a military shooter.

""using the Unreal Engine 3 to show realistic graphics and dynamic visuals."" Again, for an F2P.

""Absolutely no Pay-to-Win."" = And where you have to rebuy your grenades for no reason. And that effes me off.

""Welcome to the best F2P shooter on the market."" = Hell No. 

If you're into ratings, give it a 6 outta 10 right now. The menu is counterintuitive, there are some useless shopping mechanics, the gameplay could be nice - IF they had decided for anything but that idiotic 'run faster with knife out' stuff. The only game that can go away with that is CS. 
Expect an average F2P shooter with above average graphics."
21902,"When I first played Black Squad, I was the average newbie. A few matches later, I started noticing tactics from my opponents, then I used those tactics myself. Now I'm an average player! Decent K/D. A decent win rate, and a good weapon. Honestly this game is fun as hell! It's an addiction.. Thumbs up! <3"
21903,good
21904,For the short time I had with it it's not bad it's just a generic free fps game but it's okay you could try it but it's nothing special there are micro transactions that's to be expected because  it's free but if you  get some friends it can be fun.
21905,"cool game ,good controls, fast paced, but cs:go is better, 

Rating: 8.7/10"
21906,"Played one game and its the exact same as every other free to play on the market right now. It does not boast any less p2w features than the other f2p games available, despite all the praise i have seen this game being given for doing so. 

I am not leaving a negative review because it is a bad game, but because it is a blatant lie to claim the game does not feature any p2w structure. The free guns are by all means good and will prove deadly in a fight, and you also recieve a hefty sum of money free to purchase a new gun permanantly, but it's just more of the same really. 

Play if you want an ok fps game for free, but dont expect anything great, the game has a shitty economy too just like almost every other f2p game."
21907,"This game is amazing loving it already. If anyone else is loving it and wants to join a fun community, Join our Black Squad Discord server https://discord.gg/P9hmvJq See you soon :D"
21908,The game is plagued by aimbots and other cheats..
21909,"This game has potential, but there's some serious flaws. Lack of proper anti-cheating system means that cheaters are huge problem now, weapons and grinding system need proper balancing. Sadly, I don't recommend this game at the current state, but if you like cs:go/crossfire type of fps game. You might enjoy it, but I'd wait for it to improve a bit."
21910,"Great game! I genuinely think this game is more fun than csgo even though it isn't as competitive. Recoil is easy to handle can hip fire is amazing, no P2W so its actually a fun F2P game. The only thing i don't really like is the fact you can only buy grenades for 1 day and then you need to buy them again. Apart from that, really fun game with friends. I would happily pay £6 for this game so this game being free is awesome."
21911,Cancer is more fun than this shit.
21912,love it
21913,"Have you all been payed to praise this???

This game is no different than any other generic, arcady shooter for Europe/Asia markets.

Even though have nothing against those, this title - probably only brings players in of the ""asian COD"" thematics and CSGO gimmics like knifes and ""plant-the-bomb 5v5s"".

TL;DR - maps are boring, graphics are basic (on ultra) and the shooting mechanics are the worst for any arcade fps."
21914,It's a pretty good game.
21915,this is very similar to CS:GO.
21916,Decent.
21917,best fps in the market so far
21918,I will remove my negative review when you add competetive.
21919,"Love the game... but they need to add a story to it. Like a campaign or something. Other then that, love the game!"
21920,"good game but it has so many money currency i like the game how often do u need to play the game to unlock a weapon that costs 100,000 + and u start with 20,000"
21921,Amazing game. Just add customizations to the wepons so we could buy attachments :P
21922,"This game has only been out for three weeks (At time of review) and is exceptionally well made. For a F2P shooter with no Pay-to-win aspect, it's got some really good potential. Good graphics, no lag (as of yet), and fluid frame rate. On the downside, there are hackers in a lot of matches, high ping users usually win gun fights, and no way to report/block toxic people. Overall 8/10, if you're looking for some 5v5 with no screeching teammates, you should try it out."
21923,"For some reason the infernal game is running even though I ran it once and immedately closed it. Don't download this game, it is a waste of space and a pain in the ass to get rid off."
21924,"Im in love with this game!!! There's finally a truly  free to play mmofps out there!!!

PROS:
-True free to play, no pay to win
-Nice graphics (weapon designs, map designs)
-Very good balance between all weapons
-Noob-friendly
-Nice feel in combat (gun firing, knifes, sniping) feels like good old CoD
-Very low system requirements, almost any old pc can run this ~60fps

CONS:
-In about 200 games I've propably met over 10 hackers sadly :(

21925,"This game is by far, one of the best F2P FPS games on steam. It is not Pay-To-Win, and the mechanics are great. The game shows a lot of potential, but there are a few flaws in it... Although ""hacking"" isn't too much of a problem for me, a lot of other people complain about there being alot of them. If this gets fixed, the game would fully be perfect."
21926,"Fun game, just starts getting monotonous. It needs some alternative game modes added for public matches to offer a larger variety. For a free game though, it is top notch."
21927,"Aye, it's free, but graphics slightly better than a mobile game. Lag spikes, high pingers usually win gun fights. I get F2P games usually have some kind of grind, but jebus. <1k ingame currency per match if you do decent, assuming no opposing aimboters, and decent weaps cost ~90k-125k. Worth a try if you REALLY want something else, but very similar to CS:GO TDM/FFA servers."
21928,"nice game ,phsics and some things are bad,but shouldnt complain when getting for free.its a great option for people who want to play csgo but dont have money"
21929,Just Love It ❤
21930,"I dont know its a little bit complicated in the menu interface ad also the graphics dont really look good, they look like cs source."
21931,"Yay what a nice game. You start with a gun which is fun then somebody kills you. OK that's fine you respawn. You get spawn camped and when you try to kill the spawncamper he's just too good for you so you get dominated. And sometimes you're just playing against hackers... I guess I'll uninstall that game ... Great potential though but too much tryhards

EDIT : The hackers aren't really a problem anymore. Thanks BattlEye."
21932,"Not my kind of shooter, i like the style of csgo..

But this game is VERY fun i do recommed ;3"
21933,"Great game here. 
I've been playing Counter Strike since 2005 approximately and I started to get bored of the genre since CS:GO.
This game is clearly refreshing and I haven't found any P2W mechanics yet so that works well !
The gunshots feeling, the adrenaline, the relentless action is what makes this game good.
If you want to stay in the CS-like genre but to change environment (maps, weapons, etc). Give it a try :)"
21934,"I really enjoy this game. it's like CS:GO but F2P. and like other said its not pay to win. all you have to do is SCREAM, AIM, FIREEEEEEE!"
21935,Not to shabby
21936,"ok so people that have over 200ping are unkillable, they will sprint at you with smgs and shotguns in a blaze of glory while taking everyshot from your firing squad of a team at spawn. wouldnt be a problem if everygame it wasnt the person with the highest ping at the top of the scoreboard.  



my rating
2.7/13 ping isnt high so i cant play it."
21937,THE BEAST FREE GAME THAT I LIKED BUT THE MODES ARE 2-3 WE WONT MORE !!!!!
21938,"Could be so much better.. but its just a simple f2p arcade style shooter  and despite the advertised shooting mechanics and netcode it actually isnt anything more than meh or standard.

the most annoying issues with this game is the maps. they are all too small and too open to abusive gameplay such as spawn camping not helped by the fact you leave your spawn and can easily see the oposin sides spawn straight away. the grenaded physics are just dumb along with hit animation and the lack of running."
21939,"As of writing this, i've played .4 hours. 

First game i joined i had a decent time playing for the first... 2 minutes? After that my ping went from 70 to high 800's and became unplayable. 

Has potential, just need to improve on some simple stuff like spelling errors and obviously; the connection speeds."
21940,Can you say aimbot? Cause they're everywhere in this game.
21941,best fp2 shooter
21942,Game is perfect!
21943,"This game is not realistic at all with its guns, felt like the game was put together without thought, needs a matchmaking system for the amount of people that play this game 
"
21944,Got a rare knife on my first crate +rep!!!
21945,"Pretty fun game! Its not pay-to-win what so ever. The guns they give you right off the bat are rather strong. The microtransactions in the game don't make it pay to win. Teams seem to be relatively balanced from what I have seen. I haven't experienced hackers at all, not any blatant hackers at least. I just wish that there was ingame voice chat in this game. If they implimented that into the game, I feel that this game could feel more social and help people ingame be able to communicate to others. The maps for TDM are a little bit small for the amount of players that are allowed in TDM matches, and its very fast paced for the game type.  Other than that, the game seems pretty solid."
21946,"this good ok it get boring a while it just the same as ""combat arms"" and ""line of sight""

plus it need ""mod kick players"" AKA elite mod make rules"
21947,This game sucks...
21948,yo see the thing about this title is it the rise of the real fps
21949,Dirty Bomb is better
21950,litty
21951,"This game has to be the most uninspired CoD clone I've ever seen, but with tacked on clunky controls, poorly balanced weapons, bad maps, an abysmally bad tutorial, and the worst translation and voice over work I've seen in a while.

You're better off playing any of the other hundreds of FPS's out there, because this one clocks in at being mediocre even within the arena shooter/Call of Duty clone genre.

Don't waste your time downloading it unless you want a good laugh."
21952,"Shite game, too many COD wannabe tryhards"
21953,tac reload
21954,"Get killed by grenades you dont have - Get killed by guns you can only buy for real money - Get killed by drone strikes you dont see coming 

10/10 would uninstall again"
21955,"I must say this is one of the best free games i have played, and its not glitchy. only damage is the odd thing."
21956,It's an amazing game my most favorite in my library ten out of ten would recommend to anyone who likes fps games
21957,"How to tell if a game is made in asia, is there one weapon more powerfull that the rest? Do 10 body shots not kill some one but 2 head shots with a Vector do?  Do they send out news with broken english? do all premium items seems to be alternate skins and player models?  probably an asian FPS, also when they release that female Player model im gonna be spending money on this game cause I respect women."
21958,"Honestly, one of the best F2P FPS out there.

You can get most, if not all, vanilla guns in the game solely by playing and if you want a fancy skin you'll have to open a crate with a key and those keys & crates can be bought via money or, you guessed it, by simply playing the game, 10/10.

Good game, good devs."
21959,"Let me start off by saying that this game is actually very nice, it reminds me of the old Combat Arms and Crossfire kind of games. The weapons all seem balanced (except for things like the KSG, for what I've seen), the interface is nice and all in all this game looks and plays great.

There is, however, one great negative thing about this game; the connection of most people. They seem to be working with global servers most of the time, instead of regional servers. This results in games with 50% of the people having a good-decent ping (i.e. 40-80 ping). The other 50% however has a ping of around 140-300. This makes the game so much more tedious to play. When I shoot someone through the head 5 times, I expect them to die, not to walk away like the bullets never hit him.

So, my conclusion is that this game is quite good, especially for a F2P shooter. However, the people ruin it with their awful connections with which I personally can't play at all."
21960,"EDIT : I feel the need to update this review, since the developers still don't understand that certain things need to be changed. And the longer they wait the more players this game will lose.

The ridiculous pricing for the premium skins . Unless you get lucky pulling something out of a box, you need to spend around 400€ to get enough premium currency to buy the good skins straight up. 20K Black Squad coins with the current droprate is around 400€. This is the price for ""one"" skin. Someone in their company seriously overvalues this game and thinks it is ok to have such prices in a game like this.

Another thing where they don't even have plans on changing it yet, despite plenty of community members speaking out against it. Is the crouch spam, ability to sprint and adadadad spam while firing full auto without any penalty. Doesn't sound very skilfull right? Yea, no!

The final drop was the Halloween Event , where in any other game, you would have to beat some challenges to get some Event skins. To bring the community together and enjoy the holidays. 

They just threw some half arsed skins at us in boxes that you can only obtain with real money and the drop rate is 1% or you can also buy them for an exchange rate of 400€. Seriously????.




Pros :

- Zero Pay to win (guns are easy to get, even the medal ones you can get after just a few days.) Skins are purely cosmetic

- Good performance (runs on potato's)

- Awesome practice mode, to practice nade and smoke spots, explore the map and test weapons.




Cons : 

- The gameplay is flawed right now, by a weird netcode and high ping players (a lot of people tank shots without taking damage. Sometimes this even happens against people with a sub 100ms ping, which shouldn't be the case) Sometimes you die to someone the splitsecond you see him appear, without a chance to return fire.

- Extremely overpriced skins if you don't get lucky 400€ for premium skin is just obsurd. Yes you can play without skins, but if you like a game then you usually like to gather some cool ingame items that set you apart. But for this price, i rather buy 8 tripple A games made by professional companies.

- Strafe speed overall and acceleration is too fast you instantly accelerate from 0-100 and if you get hit , you don't slow down.

- the rifles feel extremely similar, there is no skill to master. Like learning recoil patterns (csgo) , learning correct bursting and recoil compensation mechanics to increase a weapons efficiency (Battlefield 3). It is either, spray and pray hipfire godguns or heavy hitting high recoil shoot more than 3 bullets and good luck hitting anything guns. The weapons have multiple spray patterns due to randomized crosshair jerk.

- Full running accuracy and jumping accuracy is way too good, this in combination with crouch and strafing spam, results in people ""maining"" smg's , full on spraying , sprinting jumping around corners. A disgrace to this otherwise awesome game.

- Crouching can be spammed, resulting in awkward character behaviour, so it is hard to get a skilled gunfight going. (You are better off with a fast rate of fire weapon spamming the body) . This results in people just hipfire spraying , adad crouch spamming. The biggest issue in the game imo.

- Horrible small tdm maps, with open spawns, you run 10 meters and you are in enemy territory, you run 100 meters and you are in the enemy spawn.

- Snipers are 100% accurate a splitsecond after zooming in, you can make a dot in the middle of your screen and use the sniper as a ranged one shot kill shotgun.


It is free, give it a try and make sure to download the free weapon dlc and the redeem it inside the game to get all basic weapons for 15 days for free. This way you can test weapons without the need to waste money. 

DO NOT spend any money on this game. Play it for free. Do not support developers that ignore their communities requests and then pushing out more paid content."
21961,"this game is truely awesome, servers are great, guns are really easy and fun to use, maps are fun and simple, free gun dlc which gives you most to all of the guns to try and test to see which ones you like.
so instead of wasting your money on that garbage game called csgo, save your money and play this for absolutely free"
21962,"I'm seeing a lot of reviews claiming hackers. I've played quite a few games by now and I have not seen any hackers.

I will explain what I do see. I see the effect of Ping/Latency and it manifests as times where you run behind a wall and you die to someone who seemed to have shot you through the wall. This is basically the effect of the local graphics rendering faster than the information from the server arrives to your PC to make your character actually die from getting shot.

Based on this latency issue, it could feel like people are hacking, but I haven't even seen K/D ratios reflect hackers in -any- of the games I have played. Some weapons are extremely powerful, such as the KSG shotgun, which allows you to essentially run around corners and simply click the instant you see someone, 1 shot = dead at close range. So it is possible to go on sprees and take out 5-6 guys in 5-6 shots if done properly. Mastering the aim and reflex time for that is part of the fun of these types of games, and there is no hacking involved, many times I go 30+ kills and 15-20 deaths, which is still positive K/D ratio.

All in all the game is decent, for a free to play you can get a few hours entertainment out of it and if you don't have any other first person shooters in the library then this one might be worth a try. Quick matches, and all in all pretty fun once you get the hang of it."
21963,"Good hitreg
Good gameplay

Granted there are some things that it needs, such as in-game voip, but given that it's early access, it's got a lot going for it right now."
21964,:( bad.
21965,"The game isn't that bad, but the simmetrical and small maps ruin it for me."
21966,I can't run Black Squad on my Lubuntu PC :(
21967,Played it more than some games I have actually paid for.
21968,"Ayy.
9/10

Pretty Good Graphics (Better than CS GO)
VERY good fps for me (BETTER THAN CS-GO?)"
21969,В игру играет очень много русских.Добавьте локализацию.
21970,"This game is Free to Play/Free to Win You don't need to spend any money.
My Only Problem is no Kick menu so many trolls and kids on this game. Even hackers to but we can't do anything because you can't kick them."
21971,seems like a fake CSGO to me cant even play this pile of garbage
21972,great game!
21973,"If you like point and click adventure games, then feel free to check this game out.
Otherwise, spend the 10 minutes you would be playing this game givin' ur meat a good ol' jerkin'.
You'll find more satisfaction out of that than this boring pile of garbage."
21974,This is actually the best F2P I have ever played! I enjoyed so much in Demolition!
21975,It's a fast paced FPS with fast respawns and fast action. I just like running around with the katana attempting to kill people samurai style aha
21976,"Hacked garbage, it was made with original unreal 3 engine, without the updates, bugs glitches and terrible netcode that has given way to backdoor hacktivists. they cant even implement battleye as if it is uncompatible for what they made. this game was an original asian fps, that was copied and rehashed here on steam for europe and the americas. 

there are active websites dedicated to selling cheat macros and the like and the devs and admin have lost control of the game.

it plays what you would expect it too a very fast paced FPS, but all of it is overshadowed by the wall and aim botting, and straight up glitch hacking that make the game unplayable for non cheaters.

the ingame market is pure greed, wanting you to spend at least $200 to get a mediocre skin for a weapon that looks better without it. and to get that skin, you need to get BlackSquad coins, to get BlackSquad coins, you need to purchase weapon bundle loot crates, with bullets, that you purchase with IRL money. these weapon crates have random chance to get a weapon+skin or BS coins or medals, which you will get medals almost 95% of the time, BScoins 4% and one of the weapons at 1%.

you use medals on unlocking other stuff like non-skinned weapons, or different characters.... at ridiculous medal pricing.

i also suspect that they actually run all the "" servers "" on the same hardware, the ping is trash. 

overall the game is bad, dont install."
21977,"Another game that did not get the weapon mechanics. 
The recoil is actually non-existent. the grenades are useless, because enemy has a large indicator.
And whole combat lies in ability to shoot before you see enemy.

conclusion: this is an awful game even for free-to-play standard.
Actually one of the worst today.

"
21978,"the worst control and recoil system in the history of FPS or any other game EVER.

do NOT play this unless you want to have some seisure while shooting any weapon"
21979,very nice
21980,Too many hackers
21981,"Kinda ok for a free game. Played my first couple of rounds with 200ping. I'm from Asia and there's no Asian server. I don't know how this game works in terms of unlocking gears and weapons. Grinding? P2w? I don't know. From my first glance, seems like weapons has a limited time for owning them. As expected from most of free shooter games. Overall this game is decent enough for killing times."
21982,"""Another F2P game""
""Trash""
Hello no sir.
This game is a mix of various games no doubt mainly involving call of duty but it's actually good in all aspects. Free to Play with no freemium crap. Actually good graphics. Mid-Yoker mechanics. An awesome arsenal of weapons and a shit load of fun in 4 different game modes. 
This is literally the best F2P I might have ever played and I would highly reccommend to play it right now as man people are just starting!"
21983,"This game is really not what I expected, it is on another level of ass.

CONS - 

The sens feels awful no matter how much you change it.
I am not even sure if there is directional sound.
half the time you can't tell where you are being shot from.
half the players in your game have 200+ ping.
There is little to no gun recoil.
You can spray freely while jumping and moving.

Overall as a shooter this game is ass."
21984,"After spending some time on the game, i would say this is a pretty solid game and it runs on potato. Thumbs up for the team and keep up the good work!"
21985,tac reload
21986,"Surprisingly fun game, can't wait till hackers infest this game as well."
21987,"This game is horrible. Its an extremely choppy, terribly optimized mix of Cs:Go and COD. I can't find the words to explain how horrible this game is and I supposed I should consider myself lucky seeing as that is so, because I don't have to waste as much time writing this review as I did ""playing"" the ""game."" All i'm going to say is, if you're looking for a good FPS game; Candycrush would be a better option than this."
21988,It's like cs:go but fun
21989,Amazing :)
21990,"This game is really well made BUT:
- asian menu sucks
- asian money factory, non permanent guns incoming!
- asian p2w mechanics, there is no p2w but you magically just cant get ak47 and deagle
- no big choice in guns, there are many locked
- no recoil, 2-3 guns has it
- shit ton of campers 
- cheaters using only snipers so you get rekt instantly:
- bad balanced micro maps

I might come back when most of this shit will be fixed.

Stay away from this game. Play Combat Arms or even CrossFire instead if you like asian games, if not cs:go is a choice for you."
21991,"EXPECTATION: It's a fun competitive game, definitely not pay to win but more like play to win. In other words, it takes time and effort to be the best, not money at all.

REALITY: If you don't like low ping advantage and constant disconnects from server randomly, you should not get this game. 
The server disconnects are very annoying and ruin the experience PLEASE FIX THIS!

HOWEVER: This is early access so please give feedback on the game to make it better!"
21992,"Great potiental just needs Aussie servers, asia etc!"
21993,Reviews are smurfs now.
21994,"I was expecting another middle of the road tatty free fps.

Instead i got a very tidy and well thought through game. 

No need for me to bang on about how much fun it is... it's free!

download it and see for yourself.

 





"
21995,Bad game u hold left click with op gun like ak and win no skill game just nade and afk to win
21996,"If you add voice chat the game would go from a 8.5 to 9 easily :) 
All around the game is great and its F2P and it isn't P2W, almost perfect but the game is free and hackers aren't a common thing but getting an anti-cheat of some kind would be great :)
"
21997,"AT THIS STAGE DO NOT PLAY.

Has potential, but is currently infested with hackers that just ruin the fun. Weapons need to be rebalanced and the maps encourage camp sniping gameplay as the snipers are ridiculously easy to use, a 1 hit kill and there are always long corridors for people to hard scope down and trap the other team. Needs a lot of work. Do not recommend yet."
21998,very gut game i like zie efekts but always get kiled bai b laz er
21999,"The fact that sprint is bound to ''middle-mouse click'' says a lot.
If you like call of duty, you will like this, unfortunately I have been raised properly."
22000,"I love this game!
"
22001,"really good f2p game
"
22002,this game is 5ra
22003,yea sure good game. just aim and click the head
22004,"Great FPS and its free to play so there's really no reason to not try it..
Kinda like old cod gameplay meet cs:go level design.. its a lot of fun
Oh and its not pay to win."
22005,"please add clan color on mini map <3
"
22006,"good fast paced, fun, f2p fps"
22007,Good Game
22008,"BAAAAAAAAD GAME, pay to win. All people wallhack, just lol game."
22009,"Black Squad is fast paced FPS although it is nothing special graphically or in game modes it could have been FUN but it's not and the 1 reason it's not HACKERS so the developers will lose out on any money that i may have spent because of HACKERS.
You would think with a game being an FPS that the first thing developers would do is install a decent ANTICHEAT system but no this game has been full of HACKERS from about the 2nd day it was released and continues to be after every update.As I have played FPS games over the years my love for them has slowly died a death of a 1000 cuts game by game.
I am sorry to the the developers who's game is FUN and FAST and that this review should have went under a C.O.D or a Battlefeild or other major developers game but until this issue is adressed i'll continue to keep my pounds in my pocket."
22010,"1 of best free to play game

"
22011,i love Black Squad
22012,NEEDS AUSTRALIAN SERVERS
22013,SEA SERVER PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ... Im always lagging 300+ ping Thanks XD the game is good
22014,"Great FPS game with a lot of esports potential. Played approx 40 hours and only encountered one potential hacker. Had some weird movements and shots. NOT pay to win. All you can buy are EXP boosters, gold boosters and weapon skins. The game store is still in development. We get more and more items and skins from the original game. Keep in mind that it takes a bit longer because the korean version IS pay to win and have a lot of flaws. These devs are balancing the weapons and making it not pay to win."

22018,"Cons
-Its stright up fucking garbage. Go to your trash can, and you will find this game.
-Pay 2 win....just kidding, the shop is still fucking gay.
-Game is full of campers, most likely 12 year olds or russians.
-Retarded community, I had an arguement with someone in game. All I can say is he can't spell words for jack shit.
-Hackers, hackers everywhere.

Pros
-There is none, this game is just plain fucking garbage. It like a burger but you only get the buns and nothing else.

Verdict
-Waste your time on something else better than this piece of shit game.
-Also the name of the game is completely racist.
-Just go watch porn, you wont regret it.

0.7/10 stars."
22019,Great game its filled with hackers and glitchers

-the physical engine of throwing grenade is bad
-still have many hackers
-some guns are useless"
22025,well the game is ok.. gun sounds suck.. inpact sounds are bad.. its seem like they took csgo and reskined it and made some small changes.. for a free game.. my review says no but i will give it a thumbs up for being free

22027,I cant change my callsign!.need help please
22028,"Fun to play, the maps could be better, player movement animation aswell, but cant complain for a  for a f2p.


The gamer is not pay2win

As soon has you start you get 200 000 gold plus more after completing the 2 min tutorial

Just buy  the G36  the HNK417 GL and the  BLazer  R93, with these weapons you can beat any one with medal bought weapons just at start if you have better skill, you will eventually get medals and buy the AK and M4.

The TYPE95 is crazy good and underrated and it's bought with gold that you get fast just by login in every day or playing.

I even bought bullets the devs deserv it.

Give it a try!"
22029,this IS the best free to play multiplayer shooter! it is so much fun and amazing guns and visuals i am so impressed whit this game. if you wonder if you should try it out? stop wondering you will get an amazingly fun shooter for free. Great job producers you guys get it!
22030,"The game is pure cancer. Weapons are purchasable with in game currency buy you will be on a grind. Some of the weapons out class everything. If you are in a TDM and are expecting some quality game play, wrong; campers every where that take advantage of head glitching. Nice try but this is going to be a skip for me. Was enjoyable for a few but the games weakness I could not over look."
22031,"this is a very good game thus far. some of the maps are very one sided meaning once a team sets up its over for the other but other then that the hit boxes are fair , guns a balanced , kill streaks are fun to use , if anyone needs to be added to this game is when you return to your home base you should be able to regain lost health and ammo."
22032,This game is like all the bad parts of CS-Go and cod put together. No skill required. Just play enough and get enough money to buy whatever gun is op at the time and just spray your way to victory.
22033,"Compare it with the ""S. K. I. L. L Special Forces 2"" but this game is better"
22034,"If there was a ""middle"" option, I would put this game there.

It's not bad overall. The game looks good and plays well, however, it feels pretty generic sometimes. The major problem that I found is that the South American servers, like in pretty much every online game, are filled with brazilians (the equivalent of russians in US servers) that sometimes ruin the experience by whining and insulting via chat.

Bottom line, there is room for improvement, and I'll go easy since it's an F2P Early Access game and, so far, it's entertaining enough for me to keep it installed. Give it a try."
22035,What kind of game does not have Asian servers?
22036,"I can't even start the game and its very irritating and I want my money back. NOW!

Im able to open up the launcher but every time it says ""play"" and I *click it, it just memes me and says NO im not gonna let you play! Then the cycle of me getting tilted every time I try to play continues.





Probably a good game when you're actually able to play it."
22037,"Generic fps. One sided maps. High ping opponents. Don't waste your time, there is better stuff on the market."

22046,"its not a bad game, 

just its too much run and gun for me, iron sight and hipfire has no difference.. 

if jumping and running and shooting is your thing youll enjoy it"
22047,nice game :D
22048,"This is one of the very few fps games since Sudden Attack that I thought was an okay game. However, there are many problems with this game that I wish they could fix. Until then, I would not recommend it as a game to look for replacing CSGO and such.

Cons
1. The KSG shotgun. This shotgun is just straight up the best gun possible. The reason being that its damage and consistency is better than rifles at medium range. I started the game and bought the KSG right away to see how good it was and it was too good. 
2. Maps. Maps are a huge problem in this game. Most of the team deathmatch and objective based game are too small to feel a real impact. You are constantly thrown into battle the moment you start out and it doesn't feel that great because spawn camping is common in this game. However, some say that it is a good thing that maps are smaller so that the battle is constantly going on. 
3. The lobby and main screen. It feels like a cluster and hard to navigate, wish they updated the UI for this. Also it feels as if I'm playing alone the whole time and no main chat for me to talk in.
4. No variety of game modes. Sure there are the standard game types like many fps games, but I feel like this game can do a lot more such as creating a game browser and letting people customize what guns are allowed or what type of game mode. Sudden Attack did quite a good job on this one given that it was old.

Pros
1. No pay to win feature. From what I've seen, no gun is a gun that overpowers people beause they paid for it. Going back to the KSG Shotgun, you can buy that gun right off the bat by playing the tutorial and logging in once. 
2. The graphics are actually pretty impressive for a free to play. 
3. If you enjoy cluster fuck of just death and battle then this game can be the game.

Note: I haven't ran into hackers when I was playing so I cannot say anything about it. I have experience in fps games such as Sudden Attack, Combat Arms, AVA, Battlefield, CSGO, CSS, and more. This game is impressive but they do have to fix a lot of things to make it the ""best"" free to play shooter. These are all just my personal opinion."
22049,"I am not sure i could hate a game more then this one. It is a Chinese bootleg of a Chinese bootleg. The game is only grenade spam and guessing who the server favors that moment. There are so many times where i should be killing people but then they just cease to exist and i die to somone thirty feet to my left. The maps are also some of the worst designed things in gaming history. If you're not getting insta-killed by pros/cheaters you are getting spammed out of your own spawn. These maps are so bad that i dont have to read any stat on a gun other then firerate and damage. ""poor accuracy? eh im gonna be shoving my gun directly down the throats of my enemies anyways! Range stat is 25 feet? Well the largest TDM map is 15. Got 6 headshots on a guy and they did'nt die? You actually missed everything because that person was not there. They tried to hard to make a fun fast-paced FPS shooter and they half-assed the gunplay, made the servers complete garbage, and the balancing as good as a morbidly obese child on a broken see-saw. Moral of the story, don't wate your time playing. The game isn't balanced in anyway and any fun even when balanced. If you also came from any other FPS and are at all an easily aggrivated person, DO NOT PLAY I REPEAT DO NOT PLAY. This game due to everything i mentioned above is stupidly agitating. The game is bad and i could write an essay longer then a novel on why to not get this game and everyway it is trash. (-EDIT-) Nearly every positive review is from people who have played for under 15 hours. I can nearly garuntee if you play longer you will see hwat is wrong with this game.,



-Edit- Legit the first game I have seen a game get worse with updates.
The balance is a shit storm, the hit reg is garbage, the maps are useless spawn battles, the weapons all feel the same, the game is a joke. It is a failed cashgrab that is somehow getting worse with time. I could not hate a game more."
22050,The game does not have alot to offer and gets boring after a while. the servers have crippled since the last time i played. i do not recomend black squad to anyone trying to play a f2p fps.
22051,"I'll start by saying wow! I feel this is how csgo should look at its stage but gabe just keeps eating steak while we suffer ;P The graph is top notch gameplay feels great coming from a long stay in the cs world but!!!! same issue is already happening in this game. No decent anticheat so cheaters are starting to pile in. If only these companies would use esea as a marker for their anticheat we'd have the next great game. Instead theyve done as csgo has and not done much for anticheat, with all that said try it forsure!"
22052,"PRO's:
• Practically CS:GO 2.0
• lots of skins to come across/ though most are purchased with $$, you can still farm some out yourself be it from doing dailies to farming holiday event(s)

CONS:
• Small playerbase"
22053,"Cannot recommend the game currently, single spawn points which is being camped by enemies.
seem like their anti-cheat isn't working properly...
"
22054,CSGO + COD = BLACKSQUAD
22055,"""great shooting mechanics and amazing netcode. Black Squad is a military first-person-shooter game using the Unreal Engine 3 to show realistic graphics and dynamic visuals. Absolutely no Pay-to-Win. Welcome to the best F2P shooter on the market.""

uhm no....

Animations and shooting itself feels very clucky, hitmarkers and kill feed are almost nonexistent and the voice acting is mediocre.
it's also possible to spawn camp (you can go right into the enemy spawn and just sit there as long as you want).
Everything just doesn't feel finished (which is understandable since this is an early access game).

The game might not be as p2w as other games but it definetly isn't the best F2p shooter on the market. 

I don't like this game, but why not try it out yourself?, it's free :p"
22056,"First of all, NO there isn't any P2W in this game. Black Squad is a blend of COD and CS with a little flavor of Battlefield thrown in as well in the Battle Match gamemode. The best elements from the other games are picked out, and implemented together to make a great boots-on-the-ground competative FPS. It's tight, fluid, and completely skill based. Most importantly, it's some quick fun without asking anything from your wallet. Hope to see the community grow, and the game to keep improving with additional updates."
22057,Good as a free game
22058,Great game it could use a few more things such as a better match making system or try to get a better anti cheat
22059,CSGO BUT WITH SIGHTS
22060,"Un des meilleurs F2P FPS auquel j'ai pû jouer ces 5 dernières années.

Black Squad est un FPS assez exigent en terme de skill. Graphiquement, le jeu est très beau pour du Unreal Engine 3.
Les maps sont bien pensées et les armes sont plutôt bien équilibrées ce qui fait que l'on peut trouver son propre style de jeu parmis l'arsenal proposé.

Les devs (et c'est important de le préciser) sont très à l'écoute des joueurs et des retours qu'on leurs fait. La CBT en a été un exemple concret, par exemple, beaucoup de joueurs on demandé d'avoir la possibilité de ""Maintenir pour visée"", l'option a été ajouté 2 jours plus tard.

Avantages:
- Gameplay exigent
- Facilité de prise en main
- Aucuns éléments P2W (j'en ai pas parlé mais les seules options payantes avec de l'argent réel sont des cosmétiques, skins ect...)
- Jeu équilibré
- Potentiel compétitif important

Désavantages:
- A l'heure actuelle, les dégats des armes semblent +/- aléatoires mais compris dans une fourchette (par exemple un tir au torse peu aller de 30 à 40 de dégâts alors que vous tiré au même endroit avec la même arme mais les devs on dit qu'il travaille la dessus...) à suivre...

EDIT: Les dégâts ne sont plus aléatoires désormais.

- Recoil pattern là aussi aléatoire, mais ils semblent que les devs travaillent dessus aussi, à suivre...

Conclusion:
Ce jeu à un énorme potentiel, qu'il faut exploiter.
Si vous êtes habitué au FPS, Black Squad est un must have de par sa qualité.

Je recommande vivement !"
22061,good game
22062,"Was really enjoying this game, and hope too keep playing over time but as of now with so many hackers and cheaters it makes it unfun very fast, once this game starts allwoing the report of hackers and makes it fair again ill bring this rating up but right now its not worth your time with all the cheaters"
22063,"Pros:
-It's free
-Not pay to win
-Good weapons
-Good modes

Cons:
-So many toxic players
-Little hitreg problems

7/10

Try it! It's fun and free."
22064,"Physics of the game suck... Comparing to cod because this game reminds me of it 5/10 where cod is 8-9/10. Need to fix how fast people run,"
22065,game sucks
22066,"Feels like a more updated version of Warface. Gun combat is bland and boring, with game mechanics fresh out of 2013. 

I mean, are is this really a 2017 shooter without a lean feature?

Game needs a tutorial for the menu. Granted there's one for basics (how to walk, how to shoot) but you get tossed into a match at level 1 and you didn't know you had to buy a frag grenade, muchless equip it.

Maps are pretty bland, copy & flip, but in that regard they're balanced since both sides have the same paths.

All in all, not impressive. If this was a title from 3-5 years ago I'd be satisfied with what's in the game, but today it just doesn't cut it."
22067,"So far so good! Sometimes you got to roll the dice on some of these games. But Black Squad is addicting, fun and the graphics are decent."
22068,it's ok.
22069,"Game is just terrible, the damage system is simply random, you might 1 shot an enemy in the chest or head sometimes, but also die, or you might need to shoot an enemy 7 to 9 shots to kill someone, its simply random, wich makes this game terrible."
22070,"Well I can't even start playing,game freezes during tutorial or in Main Screen I get some anticheat error and my game freeze so I have to restart PC,or log off windows account.I google it a bit a lot of ppl have same problem so you have to move your game directory in some other folder etc."
22071,Decent Game But Servers Must Be Improved
22072,Poor man's CS:GO
22073,"[h1]The game is so much fun <3 [/h1]. 
[b]But we need Asia servers asap.[/b]

EDIT : Not recommended. They are kicking because of high ping also they cant provide asia server.i wont recemmend this game"
22074,"A review for Black Squad ....            Well What I think Of the game if fricken Awesome Idk Why but when I play this it makes me fell like,I can do anything  why? Well i myself And A huge Fps Player And I have been fro my entire Life like its unbeliveable what I can Do. I have been playing this game now for 2 hours And some time today and Not even in 1 hour I had already had 200 kills and apperently to my friend that is alot. But The Statistics of the game are good. The Graphics are perfect for this type of game even at the lowest quality. It has similarties to CSGO but not many What is similar? To me I think That The Characters kinda look similar to the ones in CSGO and Titan Fall <---- From the one in the Totoural :P

Well My overall Review of the Game is Fricken Awesome So Please try the game and give a good Thumbs Up To It And I hope you enjoy my Opinion of the game :P I plan to play this all the time :D"
22075,Great F2P FPS. It has its quirks but still a good game.
22076,"play the tutorial
laugh
uninstall"
22077,Best F2P no Pay2Win FPS on the market!
22078,"Trash graphics, no asia servers, boring ass gameplay"
22079,"the game black squad is an awsome game 
its not compleet but for an alpha is it prddy good
give them a chance to make an awsome game i think they have the knowledge to do
for me the game is good enough 
7/10"
22080,Pretty decent
22081,"Would really appreciate a SEA server, this game is fun but it is just stressful sometimes that i have to play with 200 ping."
22082,gut geim
22083,GOOD GAME
22084,"The tutorial made me wanna kill myself.
Full of clichés
29 + 1  ammo
voice acting is horrible
Call of duty rip off grade"
22085,"Bloody piece of shit... Mechanics bad, physics bad, gameplay's bad... EVERYTHING IS BAD"
22086,No Aus Servers
22087,Very good game.
22088,Best F2P shooter in the store.
22089,This game is so focused on EU and NA. No asian servers. Freaking high delays for people from asia
22090,"Awesome game! 
Its 100% free, no pay to win! Graphics are on Ultra, it runs great (GTX 1050)."
22091,"its a good game but..

now i had fun with this game,when they said all these things like best graphics and no p2w i was uncertain but it really does do everything it says,the guns feel good and are realistic and the graphics are good and its not like cod where u die in 1 shot but there are good fire fights but there was 1 thing that stops me from wanting to play this game and that is snipers and camping.I know that there will always be those people who will camp in every fps but for how fluent the gameplay is to just turn a corner and to just be killed before you can even see them really takes a lot away from the game.when i could get fights it was fun but most of the time it was just being 1 shot by the sniper respawning then getting 1 shot again and i never had a chance because you just cant get a shot in before your dead

great game but massively ruined by camping with snipers,if they ever fix this then i will come back happy as ever but until then id have to say just go get overwatch or something because right now unless your one of those people who camp then this game will just be a waste"
22092,"This is good enough to be the next Call Of Duty 
I would like to see a zombie mode but the creators may get sued for copying COD

Overall i recommend this game to anyone who like FPS games"
22093,"So damn annoying, no depth, no complexity, spawn, kill, die, spawn, kill, die. Maps are just, well....Goldeneye 64 had way better maps. Save yourself the time."
22094,Full of hack's. Dont think or tryng it. you will die before the round starts. GL and Hf dev's
22095,"GOOD GAME XD
"
22096,"Boring repetetive free-to-play game, tons of grenade spam in the game, not a skill based game really. Not worth the time to download."
22097,"If a .308 round from a sniper rilfe can't one-shot kill with a headshot, it's not the gun that's bad - it's the game that's bad."
22098,"It's a really good game, but it's hard to like it. Everyone is running around with a one-hit sniper in a small map. That's just hardcore dumb, least make bigger maps and have random spawn points."
22099,"WAY BETTER THAN GITSFAO!

Fun game, try it out, you'll see!"
22100,"Pretty fun game that has a lot of potential. As of now, I think they just need to make it so you can 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 so you can just play with friends. Pretty annoying that you can't do that but I'm sure they'll add it soon. Other than that, games pretty damn good so far!"
22101,"I feel like I've been ripped off,

And it's free..."
22102,"Its a good game. It IS in development still but the Free to Play is damn genuin so far. Needs a larger roster of maps and weapons but its good for a very new game. Clans need to start battling and leveling and PLEASE dont put me in the same match thwhen kids have a ping of 60 when Im at a ping of 200+ or viceversa.

Definetly a WiP but its very promising"

22104,Great F2P shooter.
22105,Its a good game not enough maps thought and takes so long to earn gold to buy weapons
22106,"Just started playing this and I love it. I have about 18 games under my belt at this point, and its not getting old yet, unlike some games of similar nature. Not pay to win either as of yet, all guns seem to be pretty well balanced."
22107,nice
22108,"Great combo between COD and CSGO. Needs some love from the devs in order to improve it to another golden game, but it is on its way. If you want a good free to play FPS, this would be the one to go with. It should definitely be sold for money, not given away."
22109,fun game. bit like cod...small maps easy to camp spawns...al in ok for some fun.
22110,"Although controls are complicated, game runs very smoothly on high graphics. Gameplay is very good and it is based on commitment not p2w. There are many hackers even in the early access but I hope they will get banned when the official version comes out. 8/10"
22111,"Awesome game, lots of modes, devs are listening to community and updating the game accordingly. Worth playing. Money back guaranteed XD."
22112,10/10 zero pay to win if you like games like COD missed in with CSGO and Rainbow 6 this is thre game your looking for and it runs on every budget pc so you dont need a super pc to run this game
22113,"This game is awesome! Although it has some things it needs to fix, for a early access game it is amazing!"
22114,"game isnt bad for being free but gunplay is shit and people just run around with snipers scoped in and just shoot u before u can even react. 1 hs + 1 body shot with a rifle is a kill, or 20 body shots. 3/10 ign. its okay, play if youre bored af"
22115,A fun free to play fps with no Pay2Win elements.
22116,Good game all-around.
22117,Kill Hallway: The Game
22118,"I made sure to put some game hours in before i did my review.

1. Cheaters running wild but the game did have a battle eye update and it kind of dialed the cheating down a bit. but since this is a free to play game im sure cheaters will find a work around saying that they already have found a way to multiply there score's etc.

2. This game seem's to not care for racism as you will encounter many players with inappropriate names such as ni****killer and i find this inappropriate to the community. this game needs a zero tolerance policy against it's users who make such names.

The above two comments are just the two main issues i see with the game...

3. The game is not a bad game to be honest it is a nice mix of counter strike and call of duty feel to it. its fast paced with many game modes but the maps are extreamly small"
22119,Just like cs go but worse
22120,"Great free to play FPS, certainly will recommend to friends."
22121,"pro:
really fun to play when 5
doesn't need a good computer
a mix of csgo r6 and cod

cons:
may be boring when playing solo cause no voice chat
can certainly change the shop. i think its kind of hard to follow.
need a lot of game to unlock guns

really good game though u did great job =)"
22122,v v good
22123,"Mix of Counter Strike, Combat Arms and Call of Duty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!111"
22124,shit game infested with hackers
22125,its not very fun
22126,"An OK Free to play Shooter.

Gunplay is unrealistic in the way that there is little to no recoil.

Only some guns are viable, Snipers are one shot which is a plus but that overall makes the gunplay too fast for its own good.

I played about 3 matches and i was top fragging in all of them but the game was still not enjoyable.

ill give it a 2/10. if u got nothing else to do, maybe downloaded it."
22127,awesome f2p fps
22128,"Game never ran.
Support never responded."
22129,I know that this is early access but for someone who likes traditional shooters you wont like this.
22130,"when i try to play this game it just does not do any thing so keep that in mind

by that i mean i checked if the files are there and then try launching it multiple times as far as it goes is to a window similar to what Gaijin uses to check for updates and other stuff, but when i click play it just shuts down the program

just tried again on 9-30-17 still not working at all.


Edit: I did open a ticket with them and their only response was run it as an admin which I can do but will not do because I should not need to switch to the admin account just to play 1 game that can't be bothered to work otherwise even though all my other games work fine as a normale user on the computer"
22131,"With a game like Black Squad, there is no real reason to go back to games like CSGO. Better weapon balance, ACTUALLY FUN, and it's not too taxing to run on your PC. Would recommend."

22133,what a fucking waste of time
22134,nope

22139,"This game is good, but at the same time is bad.
When i played my first match i had a great time,good gameplay, good graphics and etc...But once i continued playing i noticed that there was guys with heigher level and that means that they probably have spent money on it so they had better guns and armor and at that moment i realized that  this game is kinda, pay-to-win, its playeble, but its no going to be as funny to the people that dint spend money on it..."
22140,For some reason my credit card got charged 5$ for this game and i have never bought anything before on steam?  I tried to request a refund from steam but they said they cannot refund for this game?  Can someone help me
22141,"Black Squad was to the beginning a very good Free2Play shooter with many ideas how to improve it and add more content. But in the end they failed there own goals. I used to play it every day and grind some new weapons. But when I play it now, I can only see a bad hitreg and cheaters everywhere. The current problem is that they are just like any other game.... Adding cosmetics and hoping that the players will forget the problems in the game."
22142,Wow! One of the best Free2Play Shooter! I hope you can customize your Weapon :)
22143,The system of quorum in the opening of the funds of the company
22144,10/10 Best Lobby music -IGN.
22145,"Similar to AVA, I approve."
22146,"This game may be free to play but there is allot of issues with it that shouldnt be in the game. It seems like allot of gamess try to do today is make it more astheticly pleasing instead of actually making the gameplay good. The game is not pay to win but it is pay to progress I hate that it takes a week to get 10K when all the guns are a hundred K and the premuim guns you buy with medals are already OP so anyone thats just like eh whatever can throw 5bucks down and get a premium weapon. The premium weapons are so OP compared to anything else in the game so there isnt really a huge point in spending anything except for medals. Also why would I invest time into a game to unlock something when i can just pay for it. Also the game is overran with cheaters people shooting through walls getting kills, and its more than just getting lucky they do it every damn kill and start prefiring perfectly at the person who is behind the penatrable object."
22147,"players starting off have a disadvantage becasue weapons for players starting off are drastically weaker compared to players who have been playing longer, if you want proof just look at one of the shotguns you can buy, it takes TWO shots to the HEAD with it to kill someone"
22148,"*takes direct hit with at4*
*lives*
*uninstalls game*"
22149,"Terrible game. They went to fast with launching the game. I tought it would be just like the old times, but its even worse. Gameplay to slow. Retarded movement, weapons to overpowerd. I'll rather go headbump my head in a wall."
22150,Seriously this thing is something similar to CS:GO but its free and u can purchase some weapon with ral money but that doesnt really matter. Despite its free but I can see that this games has alot of potential. Also if u wanna laugh like an idiot while shooting and get killed download this game please XD u will lose ur stress afterward.
22151,needs too much git gud
22152,"I was pretty skeptical before downloading to be honest, I thought the game would probably have some pay-to-win element, but surprisingly the in-game-currency is all you need, and it's pretty easy to earn too! I must say my expectations were more than met! It's really enjoyable although some game modes aren't amazing, and most people suck, but things can only get better from here! Great game! :D"
22153,"Pros:
-Balanced
-Not pay to win

Cons:
-Servers suck
-Hit reg is fucked
-Hit boxes huge

I server hopped between 5 servers and the lowest ping I saw on the US servers was 110 ping. Which was way lower than the 250 everyone else was getting. Hit reg is wonky (maybe that is because of the ping). And I assume like every F2P FPS there are a bunch of hackers. (Don't quote me on this but I highly doubt I am wrong). And the hit boxes are pretty damn big."
22154,yea
22155,"ITS BULLCRAP THAT THE BLAZER SO MUCH MONEY

22163,Too much lag if you are from the SEA region. Dont bother playing because its really bad.
22164,"I personally haven't ran into any hackers so far and I have played since CBT. However, I only really play the 5v5 demolition game mode so maybe most of the cheaters play the other game modes. 

The game runs great. I don't have a very good PC but I get 200 FPS almost all the time. I'm sure you could run this on a potato PC. 

There aren't any p2w aspects in this game. In the boxes/crates you buy with real money, all you get is in game currency/skins. The skins have the same stats as the default guns you can earn by just playing the game without having to spend real money. Not sure why I see some people complaining about p2w... dumbasses.

My biggest complaint about this game as of right now are the North American servers. I rarely play against anyone with less than 100 ping. There needs to be an Asian server added so I can stop playing against Japanese/Tainwanese 200ping cucks.

Also, when you scope with the DSR the mouse sensitivity feels super weird. It's hard to hit fluent flick shots and achieve basic kills. The MSR/Blazer and the semi snipers do not have this issue. I heard it might be a low DPI bug. plz fix"
22165,It's a good game but Cheaters ...
22166,"Gameplay is fun - sad some people don't read the guides and don't stick to objectives.

Also, no servers in SEA/Australia - Lag is too much."

Its not that. and the content theve been releasing is free so far. All of it. Did i mention its HELLA FUN? Also the only legit bad review I read on here is about the hackers. They apear somtimes. Dont really know why. Fun game though. Also free so try it instead of reading reviews. Dont be lazy.
22174,"My honest Opinion - 
It's too hard to get guns, it's a very pay to win game. 
There are only American And European servers... No Australian server or anything else which leads players like me to lag and have a decreased enjoyable expirience of the ""online"" perspective of the game.

They Just upated the whole game, It's nice to see they added more servers.
It's very obvious they tried to copy Counter Strike.
I'm not bashing the game, it's just a not-as-good-version of CS. It's good if you don't have the $15 or however much it costs to buy Cs.
It would be nice to see the Owners of Black Squad implement a more ""first timer"" user friendly experience.
It didn't take me long to figure it out, but it was confusing, and I'm still learning how the interface works.
Overall, I'd give it a 7/10 taking into consideration Graphics, controls, interface, etc."
22175,"The game is awesome, although, it would be great to have more players"
22176,10/10 Very nice Graphics and no pay to win free game! What do you need more? LOL.. What you waiting for................  Just dowload it!
22177,great ass game!
22178,how do you join a game
22179,Trash F2P game full of cheaters
22180,"A solid F2P shooter ruined by low tick rate servers and only east coast servers. Client side hit reg also translates to a lot of Asian/Brazallian ping abusers which results in deaths behind cover more often than original Battlefield 3. 

This game is ultra grind heavy too. Maintaining a solid K/D/R along with over a 70% win rate I was only just recently able to acquire ONE competitive weapon. You can bypass the grind with real currency of course. 

One last thing, this game claims it uses BattlEye, the best anticheat on the market right now. However, the extreme amount of suspicious players makes me doubt it has an anticheat system in place or maybe they just don't bother updating it. 

Overall if you're on the east coast to take advantage of 20 ping then the game might be worth your time. Otherwise it's a frustrating and tedious experience filled with what seems to be a high amount of cheaters."
22181,.
22182,"This chinese sht is complete crap!
How tha fck is this well rated??
LoS way better game and it's low rated.
-rep"
22183,"CSGO for poor people, 0/10"
22184,Awesome game download it a mixture of csgo and cod really fun hope u guys add rank soon
22185,NOTHING
22186,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1YxCFRmDwM Watching!!!!!!!!
22187,the first ever pc game ive played and i like alot 10/10
22188,"The pefect mix between CoD and CSGO. I really enjoy the style of this game and the free to play aspect as well. The Devs are listening and pushing updates as time allows.

Do not listen to the people say its a pay to win game because it is not. This game is the perfect example of free to play. Give it a try and see for yourself."
22189,"With just over 3 hours played I think I can establish some things that are good and baad about this game.  For one I love the interface, which to be completly honest, I hated at the beginning.  Another thing, their case opeinging system is cool nut can take your money away as fast as any other.  The game though being in early access gives me some great excitment as well it can handle it self pretty well.  I love the class selection and I love the graphics.  There are just a few problems that I well woudn't expect.  One their are a lot of hackers, a lot more than you would expect.  Also the game is very sniper heavy right now.  I have realized that in my games 10 people on each team will just line up and start sniping across map.  I think I have only finished one game so far in the 16 v 16 game mode.  But I do have to say the graphics and how the game hold its self still impresses me.  But as I said the hacking in this game is so bad and ruins what I think can be a sucessful free FPS."
22190,Got RSI and broke mouse.
22191,"Dear Devs, This game is good but please keep make this game free to play and no pay not win. ! add some new wepons in gold modes and please increase the gold amount in each map. It's so low amount we get if we win,, and fix the hackers !"
22192,Need South East Asia Sever.. Can You guys let us know when can you put it up? Lot of Asian fans Need to know.. Its a Good game but the thing is we need a server
22193,wish you could use a controller ut overall really good game
22194,pretty dope
22195,"As good as this game is, it is full of cheaters and hackers. Well, maybe not full, but they are there. Chances are, anyone who says there aren't hackers are most likely hackers themselves. BattleEye is not all seeing like alot of people in the discussions seem to claim. A few days ago, I saw someone (with a name I will NOT re-post due to racial slurs within it...) just jumping around, teleporting, and killing people, not even 1 minute into the match, an NO ONE on my team could even leave the spawn. This is not a noob thing. This was a clear hack. You know it's bad when his own team was calling him out and saying it wasn't funny. This guy said he was ""bugging"". Seriously, if you're looking for a good time, I can't reccomend this just yet... BattleEye is not 100%, hackers ARE in this game much to what others will tell you. I hope the developers are clearly aware of this. Give it some time... I may change this review. Keep an eye on this one, it's good, but the hacks are real man..."
22196,one word.....Trash.
22197,"I've only played two matches, the controls are very nice, has a few lag spikes here and there, but overall a fun time, I fully recomend this, especially because it's free. Hope this is helpful!"
22198,neat
22199,"This game is pretty fun.  It has it's moment just like lots of games. I think the maps could be a tiny bit bigger. Other than that thought, I like the game. I hope more maps and weapons are coming."
22200,"one of the worse shooter i've played for a very long time
don't understand the positive reviews at all

it's not military at all
you don't even use the iron sights
you just run and gun and there is no spread"
22201,This is a good game and does all it said on the store page. Not sure why so many people are going on about hackers have not even ran into one. I think the people calling out hackers are just bad.
22202,Cool game.
22203,New patch = crap
22204,Just bad. Its all of the bad of CoD with none of the good. Maps make CoD maps look like Battlefield maps. Gun play is an abomination just like CSGO. It was free and I still want my money back.
22205,"Fun game but soms weapons are really overpower like the ak-47

3 shots and youre dead
"
22206,"Big part of the newmade community of Black Squad are ex. A.V.A players. We all left A.V.A behind, because the game is dead. No competition, broken balance, P2W, cheaters, etc...
We all would like to see a lot of competition in this game, devs that will listen to the community and no P2W.
This game has potential as far as I see it.
Thanks"
22207,"Tbf I was hesistant at first when I installed this game, seeing as most f2p shooters are pay to win (which is a shame). However, the first thing I was greeted with was a very interesting tutorial which went over the basics of the game mechanics, which was a nice touch. 

However the main worry for me was if there would be a pay2win aspect to the game, and I feel as though there isn't, for the most part. One thing that was noticable was the fact that you only get grenades for a limited amount of time, and in a fps game that seems somewhat stupid to me, but you can buy the grenades with in game currency which is easy enough to earn, I tended to get about 1000 gold per game (on 8v8 demolition) when I finished mid to high table. However to get new weapons you can either grind out gold or medals (medals are awarded for levelling up). The guns you can buy with medals seem to be better, but medals are few and far between (as leveling up can take a while). As well as the guns you can buy with medals you can also get guns with the gold, and on top of this, you start of with enough gold to get one them :D Which is a nice touch.

Overall, this game exceeded my expectations, the one thing I don't like is the abundance of 'quickscoping', but it's a modern fps game so what can you do.

7/10 - Worth a go imo :)

*EDIT* The game looks great, and runs really well, my rig (i5 7600k, rx 480) runs the game at 200fps pretty much all the time on max settings (1080p), and my mate who plays it on his weaker pc still runs it at the medium settings at 100+fps, and he says it still looks great."
22208,Dont even try it 20% of the players use hacks
22209,I would recomend this game to anyone who likes FPS!
22210,really good ftp fps game... no joke... its worth it and more... id pay to get cosmetics and maybe a variant of a weapon but so far i cant find a way.
22211,"some failed copy of CoD and csgo . game is full of kiddos with auto aim ... pain in the ass to make gold you make 1000-3000 per mach and you need 200000 for a good weapon , this game has more skins than weapons and yeah i know its early acces but its unplayable"
22212,Another plain and boring crap of a free fps game.
22213,Definitely there should be knife and bomb only option/round. Great game.
22214,"Could be a fun game, needs anti cheat."
22215,Its an average game. Thats all there is to it. Run shoot and kill. I know its in BETA but its not like their going to add wall running. There are much better games out there not to mention the fact you have to buy grenades. Its completely overrated  tbh.
22216,"I'm an occasional player. Just want to sit down once or twice a week for one hour and shoot someone. I'm happy with this game, it is fast, it is cool and there is not many good players yet in the team deathmach games. So even when I'm not the best sharpshooter in the city, I can enjoy the game and score nicely.
UPDATE: after several weeks, skills of other players rised up and the game is no more fun for occasinal players as I am. So if you are really good in shooters, try it. Otherwise avoid."
22217,"Taken too long to remove hackers,

10k peak players 

45k hack downloads

No working anti cheat

Sorry but No for me"
22218,"this is a very good game, normally im not a fan of fps games but somehow i've ended up getting really addicted to this one!!"
22219,TAC RELOAD!!!!
22220,"This game is a rock solid 4 of 5 stars!!! Why 4 out of 5? Because the maps are criminally small and insanely poorly designed. Literally everything else is flawless!! This game is in early access so I implore the creators to ADD SOME BRIGGER MAPS!!!

But either way this game game's polish blows me away and I suggest everyone reading this PLAY IT NOW!!!"
22221,"After my first 5 Games:
2 Team deathmatch
2 Demolition 5v5
1 Demolition 8v8

I have concluded this game is too easy, as I average 43 kills a match (I've done the math)
With a 2.7 KD

If you're aiming, you're dieing."
22222,The most sound mechanical FPS shooter I have played in years.  Takes you back to a time where FPS games were simplistic but great.  A really enjoyable game.
22223,Just absolutely horrible. It feels like it's an under developed iphone app. Just don't get it.
22224,TAC RELOAD
22225,its a good game i realy enjoy it so far so much
22226,I can't wait for controller support. This looks great in 3d!
22227,"ok
"
22228,"SO MUCH FOR THE PAY TO WIN, GOT TO BUY THE BULLETS TO BUY BOOSTERS. I CALL BS

BUT IS A GOOD GAME. LOVE IT"
22229,LETS MAKE RANKED MATCH!
22230,i wish they make  you test weapons like practice mode or something like that
22231,"It's like CoD, CS, and Combat Arms had a baby with a Battlefield game mode on the side. Solid F2P FPS that lets you buy guns permanently with in-game money, and only has cosmetic variants available with real money (chance to win, however). Good for TDM and Demolition game modes, the Battle Match game mode is a big team clusterf@@@ but its a fun diversion. Highly recommended for arcade-style military FPS fans."
22232,"Its forsure a great game its kind of like CSGO but with the unreal 4 engine. It has better hit detection and better graphics and it even has a clan system. The devs really do a good job listening to the community and the best thing it is free.
"
22233,This was on its way to being a good game. was logging in at least 8 hours of play time on it everyday but there are so many hackers now its not even worth playing cause you die as soon as you spawn. would be nice if they had a way to filter the cheats.
22234,Daaaeeemmmm this game is good :D
22235,I think it very potential
22236,Really good game
22237,Unreal fps.
22238,"IF YOU ARE ANYWHERE OUTSIDE OF EUROPE OR NORTH/SOUTH AMERICA, this game is unplayable. Apart from the lack of servers this game is pretty good. the snipers and damage systems are broken though."
22239,decent game with decent mechanics.  Feels like COD but plays like R6.  Good game for those who don't play Counter Strike
22240,its lit fam... its lit
22241,"great game
"
22242,nice game to noob like me
22243,GREAT GAME- UNDERATED AF
22244,"Not a bad game...
but there are some issue with floating guns..."
22245,"Ugh, This game... 

 For starters, the preview content looks amazing. It gives the intention it's a little more of a realistic CS:GO.. However it's the total opposite. Litterally just a terribly balanced (maps, guns ect) game. All the guns just have a stupid fast rate of fire and can't hit anything. The one map I played was pretty much 4-5 hallways that you just battled for corners. 99% sure aimbots, too. 
 Don't waste your time playing this.. free or not"
22246,"So far from my experince this has been a really fun game to play. Free to play and not Pay to win. I highly recommend this game, you will have a great time!"
22247,No Australian servers. Cant play at 300 ping...
22248,awesome game please make a SEA sever thanks
22249,"This game is really great except for the most crucial part. There is only one server. When you start the game you can chose between NA, SA or Asia server but don't get fooled, this is the same server. I tried playing all the server and I was still playing against the same peoples no matter what server I chose. That means you're playing against people with 100+ ping. The number of time I've been shot behind a wall because of the lag/ping. It's really hard to play multiplayer fps against people with high ping. Until they really do regional server I will avoid the game for now."
22250,COD [Mordern warfare days] + CSGO = Black Squad
22251,MAKE Oceanic Servers!
22252,Although the maps are small the game plays very nice. So for anyone giving bad reviews of this game for that please note that this is still in early access. The maps will probably get bigger. Good Job to the devs for this awesome game. Keep up the good work
22253,"Sub-standard for 2017 , outdated engine and graphics / game mechanics. feels very clunky and footsteps being almost non-hearable ( with the best headsets on the market.. ) unless very close by + gunshots cant be heard with silencers even when shot near you.  Saddly its  just another rushed cash-grab and the only f2p ""relevant"" game right now."
22254,10/10 .
22255,It's a fun game but there are just too many cheaters around and no way of reporting them
22256,Great Game
22257,"Changed my review to positive thanks to some new changes, and their partnering with esportshub ladders for competitive. 


Game needs to implement rigorous anti-hacking features. 
Streamline the report process and votekicking. Reporting should actually matter as well. 

The easy to obtain weapons do not stand up to the others (I get being weaker but its more than I care for), however at least you can grind any weapon for free. 

can't customize sights on weapons, particularly some ARs could really use more magnification even if by a little to suit preference/playstyle. 

not slowed by bullets. I tend to like strafing and not being slowed much (used to love socom games). But since the TTK is so fast being able to strafe so much is not fun. 
a little bit of slow when hit would be nice. 

ADS scope that only magnifies the lens would be nice. 

not sure if walking improves accuracy or not. 
ADS should make you walk a little slower. 
Sound is god awful (weapons don't have satisfying sound). Music is okay but the quality is poor. 

Positives: 
It's free!
nice maps, character models, animations. Performance is good. 
with new update there are more ways to find games with custom matches and even clan matches is a nice feature. 
Also plenty of game modes (very cool)

I'd rate 5 out of 10, though there is ample potential."
22258,"No Aussie servers. It's a pity too because the game's gorgeous and looks like it could be a lot of fun. Good luck trying to play it in Aus though.

EDIT: THERE ARE NOW SEA SERVERS. THEY'RE NOT OCE BUT HEY THE GAME IS ACTUALLY PLAYABLE.

So yeah the game is actually pretty neat. It's got a fair business model by the looks. The engine feels responsive and crisp. Latency is unnoticable up to 150 ping (the highest ive gotten in SEA servers). Guns feel nice to use. Doesn't have the greatest graphics but still nice to look at, especially given the game's F2P. Devs seem to be pretty good too.

EDIT2: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DID BUT CONNECTION TO SEA SERVERS IS RUBBISH NOW. I USED TO MAX OUT AT 100PING BUT NOW 220 IS THE AVERAGE."
22259,"Loads of hackers! Ran into guys speedhacking and having unlimited explosives in their grenade launcher.
Everything seems to be clientsided... devs these days :("
22260,Wow its amazing. PLease lets get SA servers so this game can grow to something  beter then all the other FPS games this is so fun wow great job.
22261,amazing game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
22262,"This is too awsome but i wish its like CS:GO you need to buy in the main game not in the inventory things :/
But this is ok!"
22263,"This should be put in the neutrual section.
[spoiler]Some maps are very small, where you can have a full flank in under 20 seconds.[/spoiler]
(edit: Many new maps have been added, catering this exact issue, making such flanks nearly impossible.)
[spoiler]No ping setting for matchmaking. (Have fun dying when you're around the corner by a SEA player, very common on EU)[/spoiler] (edit:This issue has now been fixed and we can play in peace.)
Gunplay is a bit sloppy ADSing gives you no advantage, nor disadvantage. (To cater prefrence, I guess.)

Overall the gameplay is fun, reminds me of Soldier Front (WITHOUT the p2w mechanics). Clanmatches being added today (11/08) very exciting stuff indeed.

If you are looking for a F2P game where you can sink hours in without going WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS P2W GAME???? This is the F2P Shooter for you.

[spoiler]Given how small some maps are and the movement speed cap for the stupidly fast flanks.[/spoiler](edit: This issue was referenced in the other edit.) This is a good game, you get gold by playing to purchase most weapons, at a cost of 200k (~100 games) but you start with 200k so you can get whichever weapon you prefer right off the bat, and this is how you get weapons. Newer weapons being released requiring another in-game obtainable currency, Medals. (obtained by ranking up and completing events. (Free DLCs containing most weapons for 15-days so you can try them all out)

This review looks really weird, but I'll update it someday whenever the game gets out of EA. if i still play lol"
22264,eyyyyy
22265,"very fun game, only bad thing is hackers. other then there being hacker i have to says it's a well made game. it's aiming system reminds me of csgo alittle but it also has a sway, i would highly recommend anyone to play this that is if you can handle hackers every now and then."
22266,the fucking lag on this game is terrible if u live in aus. There should be more servers closer to australia.
22267,It is a nice ass free fps idk why niggas always crying over shit
22268,"Pretty good.
NetCode- ✓
Maps- Would put a bit bigger in my preference, but it's fine. ✓
Weapons- All weapons are avaliable and there is no P2W yet. 
Anti Cheat- Pretty bad, ""at the moment"", but I know Battleye just needs time to sort everything out.
Other- Needs ping limit on servers. See too many players with 150+ ping and it gets annoying because of the delay in the hit register even though the hit registration is bad already. 

Would rate 6.5/10 because of the anti cheat not doing so good right now and being cheaters heaven. Needs better hit registration. Movement needs to be fixed [CROUCH SPAMMING, A-D SPAM]. When hit body moves [Needs to be removed as it just makes it harder to hit the other shots]. Party queue not stomping solo queue players. Overall good game, mostly pure skill and a bit of love from the hit registration system. Would recommend!"
22269,Quite good for a generic FPS.
22270,so far it is an amazing game i thought the game would be completly dead but nope i can if games faster then tf2. please get a better anto cheat cuz there are alot of cheaters and please add workshop and trading
22271,this isnt even remotely or at all related to this game in any way shape or form i just want to let you know i love jake paul
22272,"good game 

pls .... Server : sea"
22273,Fun game with good gunplay
22274,AMaZinG GaMe
22275,lol trash. that's it.
22276,"Gunplay feels good, but needs ping limit with custom matches. Nothing sucks more than having someone hop on from across the planet and shoot ""through"" walls and cover, but really just taking advantage of ping."
22277,"Great game. It is well optimized, good graphics, easy to find a server with no hackers, many gun options. The only down side is that you can't heal once you get shot. I believe there is a way you can but is sucks that you have to pay for it. I'm not 100% sure if this is the case. This is more of a preference for me. It's harder to get multiple kills if you can't heal after you get shot, and I like getting kills. I also think it's lacking some maps, I mostly play on team deathmatch cause I find it dumb that if you die you're out and have to wait for the next round (Im talking about search and destroy). I played about 10-15 games and I have only seen 2 maps. Maybe I just unlucky but there should be more maps. The maps are a good size too. They're a little smaller than Call of Duty maps. It's about the size of CS:GO. The way you move and play is also very similar to CS:GO, so this is a great way to test to see if you will like CS:GO. Overall, it's a great game."
22278,Its a fun game with a very good model in terms of a free to play game. I wouldnt play battle as 90% of the matches ive been in with that game mode have hackers that instantly blow up the objective. Once Neowiz fixes the anti cheat to be more stringent than I will recommend this game.
22279,black gold
22280,"This is a great game being free to play and still in development. There are however some things that make it awkward when playing, such as the run key is the scroll on the mouse. Possibly weaponry ungrade options would make it nice. From what i've seen there is a nice selection of weaponry available. Also making it to were when you cant shoot people till you have fully spawned in. I myself get irritated with other player being able to shoot me while i cant shoot them. With thos changes this would be a better game in my opinion."
22281,"Here's my review on this game: <b> PIECE OF S*IT TRASH GAMME FILLED WITH HACKERS AND NO WAY TO BAN/REPORT THEM. </b>

Don't recommend."
22282,"Used to be a decent game until all the hacks. Not even playable anymore. This should be easily patched but it has been like this for a while now. It is just getting worse.

UPDATE:
On August 5th they released an appology for the frustration dealing with the hacks. They are working with developers on an anti-cheat. 

This is an early access game, plus it is free, so you got to give them a break."
22283,"[WOULD RECOMMEND]


At 40h in I'm still enjoying this game. I haven't spent a penny, I have all custom gear so totally not P2W.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this will be the pros.

1). its free.
2). guns, they are great.
3). Great movement, able to lump and clime.

^2) A nice selection of weapons, 3 side arms, a bunch of primary, and 5/6 knives, as well as grenades, smokes, and flash bangs. each gun will have or may not have attachments IR pointer, suppressor. also weapons will impacted movement, bigger heaver weapons will slow you down, lighter weapons you will run faster. 
 
And this will be cons.

1). some times the game will stall.
2). high ping players. (Added at 40h in)

^1) game will suddenly stutter, more then once it has lost me a stand off.

^3) high ping players, so players with 250+ ping seem to win matches, more and more join and its gotten ridiculous. (Added at 40h in)

anyway all in all this is a great game and I'll be putting many hours in here, and would totally recommend..........................
..........................17h mile stone..........................................
still haven't spent a penny, still fragging, getting better weapons, and enjoying the game a hole lot more.
i bought a crate using ingame ""gold"" which is earned in game, bought 3 of them and got some pretty okay loot.

I'll do another update when the game becomes P2W."
22284,''TAC RELOAD''
22285,Game is fun but these hackers make it impossible to play.
22286,with a playerbase of mostly hackers id say the game needs an anti cheat. played 50 games today and only had 3 games where there wasnt a speedhacking aimhacking infinite ammo rocket spamming dude ending game in seconds. fun game tho just really shitty there isnt a anti cheat OR A WAY TO REPORT HACKERS
22287,"I really want to like this game.

I will preface this by saying all my experience in the game is in Team Deathmatch, because that what interests me most. Call me a casual, that's just me.

God d*mn, is this game frustrating. There's a lot to like here. The gunplay is excellent, and the monetization scheme seems fair, as well as completely optional. The fatal flaw of this game, is the map design. The maps are way too small for an 8v8 Deathmatch, and they are designed like meat grinders. Sure, you have your three main alleys, like most modern shooters and MOBAs today, but they are so isolated from one another that you just end with a stalemate on one end of each lane.

Every map seems to have a long, straight hallway of some sort, that inevitably gets dominated by 1-3 people with sniper rifles. All of the other lanes are the same story, just with shorter range weapons like assault rifles and smgs. It feels extraordinaly snowbally, and flanking routes are placed poorly, if at all. There are also bizarre choke points, like on the boat map, where every single lane can be covered from 2 points. This would maybe be acceptable if those two points weren't on the same side of the map.

Honestly, I'm only giving this game a thumbs up because I think it has potential. As it stands though, the maps are just awful. I still have some risidual desire to play this game because of the tight gunplay, but I can say for certain, that interest is going to get progressively smaller every time I launch up the game because of the map design alone."
22288,"Literal aids in the digital form.   
-counter strike-like maps
-call of duty weapons
-battlefield health and playermodels
-1 shot headshots
-everyone is fast as shit 
-if you can flick with a sniper, you win every gunfight

= literal fucking aids"
22289,Poor man's Counterstrike.
22290,"Its the same as every other F2P game on steam, don't even bother downloading it,"
22291,"Like many others are saying, the game is plagued by hackers and there's no in-game way to report them, which is messed up. In order to report, I first had to google ""How to report hackers Black Squad,"" then I found a link to the Discord in which the FAQ finally gave me the link to the website's report page. To make things worse, they require video evidence of the hacking. How many people actually record all the time? 1%? 2%, maybe? I was lucky enough to catch a lot of them while streaming, but getting 4-5 hackers out doesn't solve the problem.

I should also mention that you'll only find hackers in Battle Mode, the main objective-oriented 16v16 gametype. If you're one of those people who's only ever interested in TDM, you'll probably never see a hacker. I, however, love Battle Mode and really hope to see it cleaned up soon. I suck at killing in FPS games, but I'm always near the top of the list because I focus objectives. Feels good.

That said, the actual game is excellent. I love the fast pace of it, but unlike Counter Strike, guns actually have realistic recoil. Anyone who's actually fired a rifle knows that it's perfectly possible to fire while jogging without your spread growing to a 30' radius.

So far, there is no pay-to-win. Every gun can be purchased with in-game currency, paid weapons are only cosmetic reskins of free weapons. Once you have a gun you like, most currency will go towards grenades. You get 15,000g every day you log in and you can get three days worth of grenades for far less than that, so gold will stack up quickly.

HOWEVER, as we've seen in many other games, this could change at any time. Never trust a F2P game to stay fair. For now though, it's a great game with a ton of potential. I'd say give it a go.

"
22292,Played some online matches and I must say it's a nice FPS tbh. I don't see this game getting a competetive stage but it's fun to play every now and then. Would recommend you check it out atleast:)
22293,"very very good game. Best part about it is that it's free to play, and not pay to win."
22294,It's a pretty fun game. Mix of counter strike and call of duty
22295,"First off, this game has huge potential. I presonally enjoy the game because it to me is a cross between CSGO and COD(sorta). The game runs very well and for a f2p game there is a lot of content and replayability. The game is pretty balanced as of right now imo, very little tweaks here and there , but overall a solid experience. 

BUT there are a few key FLAWS that i hope will get ironed out. 

1. THE HACKERS ARE RAMPANT!
2. NON NA PLAYERS OVERWHELM THE NA SERVERS WITH THEIR LAG AND OUTRAGEOUS PING (easy fix limit ping)
3. NO IN-GAME TEAM VOICE CHAT RUINS THE TACTICAL FEEL OF THE GAME SINCE THERE ARE NO COMMS UNLESS YOU ARE A CLAN IN A VOIP CHAT

IF these problems are fixed then this game imo could last but at this rate there are a lot of people i know who are about to give up on the game already."
22296,too many hackers. nothing is happening to them
22297,this is a fun game i enjoy it a lot but there is absolutly no wpolicing of the cheaters. i have had everything from wallhacks aimbot extra armor the whole bit. it makes it not fun and i cant find a way of even reporting these players.
22298,"In short, this feels like CS but good. It has ADS, is a small arena shooter, and has very quick match making.
For a free shooter I was pleasently surprised and am still having a great time with it, and 9 out of 10 times I will say I hate shooters. Thsi is not one of those cases.
It is in no way a pay to win game. You get a ton of in game cash for logging in each day and its easy to get new weapons if you simply play yhe game a little bit every day. Hell, they start you off with some money to buy weapons.
All in all I think the game is fantastic for not only a free game, but one that is in early access. I seriously have high hopes for this game."
22299,"game is super fun, but hackers ruin good things."
22300,"Fun game, but I wont put any money into it at this point, there are way to many hackers, about 1 out of 4 maps you will run into a hacker, and very obvious ones, they make rocket launchers fire like machine guns.......so yea until thats fixed I will not put any money into this game."
22301,"I have played a couple of hours of this game and I can truly say that this game is very good. To me personally it fells like a Call of Duty/ CSGO cross over but its a good thing. The game is really easy to understand and play the controls are the same as any other FPS game. Definitely would recommend this game to anybody very good game and really fun to play.

Here is a link to the video I made on this game check it out and tell me what you think. If you want add me on steam we could play together. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1BNePZCG_w&t=25s
"
22302,"I rate this game 9/10

Sounds = Good
Gameplay = Good
Hackers = Not good, very bad, need to be taken care of

Overall as I said above this is a 9/10 game. Its worth downloading and playing!"
22303,"2 Hours into to it and I'm having so much fun, the game is very enjoyable.

plz pley gam gud gem!1!"
22304,Tons of hackers as well as it is pay to win you but in game currency to get better weapons
22305,"I'm having a really good time TRYING to play, but I keep getting Invalid approach [5] [8]"
22306,"If you are looking for free to play fun FPS game, this is for you. Try it, very good  and fun :)"
22307,"like anyother free game shit tones of hackers today even meet a speed hacker he was teleporting throught the whole map it's sad that a game that has been out for 2-3 years in asia still has problems with the anti cheat ohhh wait THE GAME DOESN'T HAVE A ANTI CHEAT YET WTF?

for now it's a fucking no don't play this game untill the add a *FUCKING* ANTI CHEAT

22308,"Do you like Counter-Strike? Do you wish Counter-Strike had less salt? Do you wish that there was no cancerous voice chat? Then Black Squad is the game for you! F2P, not P2W, black squad is the essence of a shooter with less salty people.
(They might be salty, but you won't be able to tell with the communication system. It's the classic typing kind.)"
22309,Its sucks. its copying csgo in the shitest way possible
22310,"This game is great for people who want to play Call of Duty or CSGO but haven't got the money yet or maybe you just want to try something new and I'll say give this game a try. The graphics are good even if you're gaming with a potato toaster but since this game is quite new, hackers are starting to appeared and I wish the developers will fix this soon before the hackers drive the fanbase away"
22311,"This is a great game but there's already hackers in battle mode 
Please fix this"
22312,Best Game
22313,2 good 2 b free and 2 good 2 b real
22314,"Don't be fooled, this game is P2W, and the ""free DLC"" is just trying to make the game look good, when in reality it should of been in the game already (without you needing to download it seperately).

This game has no spawn camping prevention, just pray your teammates aren't idiots and can turn a 360 and shoot at 1 person. Easy enough, until that one enemy spawn camping bought enough time for the entire team to begin spawn camping.

The mechanics are terrible and obviously not their ideas. It's easy to say this is COD but with less of the ""good"" features (like spawning randomly in the map away from enemies, for christ sake)

Note: Headshots are impossible in this game, what should be a one hit kill requires you to shoot somewhere between their eyes to their mouth, and that wont even kill them. This game doesn't give you a kill cam or any knowledge of other players health, so you wouldn't know if you were close to the kill, or if they're hacking and you couldn't make a dent into them, bringing me to my final point. 

Their anti cheat is practically non-existant. I've encountered a hacker on my second (and last) game. All in all, [b] battlefield is still better[/b]"
22315,its good
22316,Really fun Like CS:GO and line rainbow six combined
22317,"great game kills sound good
"
22318,مياو
22319,i cant play..it keep saying invalid approach.
22320,It's okay.
22321,"TL DR: Not worth your time.

I just tried this game out, because my friends said I should try it. Soooo... My first experience in this game was:

1. Quick match to a game.
2. Spawn in with the free limited time ""DLC"" weapons.
3. There's literally a guy named ""Cheater"" in the game who just keeps bombing our spawn with infinite granades at over 1500rpm and teleports around headshotting people in too.
4. Quit.
5. Write this review.

Also every single mechanic and control of this game is complete shit."
22322,"The gameplay is fun and relaxing if you don't try too hard.

What's ruining that are the hackers shooting hundreds of grenades at a time and the UI is pretty convoluted but workable.

Can't say I recommend it due to the hacking but it's not -that bad- yet."
22323,Good.
22324,Play to win not pay to win awesome f2p fps !
22325,Don't waste your time with this garbage. It sucks and too many hack cheating faggots.
22326,"No server for Asia.

EDIT: Has a server for almost every region now."
22327,nice game! download guys
22328,"In just 2 weeks became filled with cheaters! No report system, no tools for kick ingame, no reaction from developers! Already dead game, dont bother to install! RIP"
22329,"Great game to play
The community is a bit questionable - alleged hackers playing in the game
It still needs a bit of tweaking as I feel like its missing something
Overall, good game"
22330,"""Tac Reload"" Simulator 2017"
22331,"Better than any CoD game,at least for me."
22332,"1. Getting from spawn to spawn takes 10 seconds
2. Absolutely no recoil in sniper rifles and pistols, little recoil on assault rifles and smg-s.
3. Of course you can pay for better guns with real money, its free to play.
4. You think a headshot will kill the enemy? Think again.
5. Tutorial explains some features you don't even use in game but doesn't explain some features you do.
6. People who are veterans at these kind of games will destroy you with 1 shots from snipers."
22333,"Good game early access so few issues to iron out , hackers being main one but new updates inbound to include HARDWARE BANS FOR HACKERS . besides this it is a fast paced shooter with a lot of fun to be had , devs that actually listen and try and implement suggestions from the community . and no p2w a refreshing change from other money hungry developers ."
22334,too much hackers in this one
22335,There's nobody online/
22336,"Hackers are ruining the game.  NOBODY monitoring time of wins vs score.  Seems like an easy way to find them.  Wish someone would stand up to these idiots.  

HINT:  You can have the best game in the world and people will not play it if you allow hacking.  Can't win battles in 30 seconds."
22337,"When i press play a little box pops up saying launching game, and when that disappears nothing happens and the game does not launch
"
22338,Other than the hackers its amazing
22339,We need a SEA server :D
22340,every match with a complementary tiny dick child who just learned about downloading hacks
22341,shit game patched hacks go unpatch idiots
22342,game is fucking great i love it i hope they have a more competitive scene with skill groups in the future i hope they have better bomb mechanics in the future i hope they balance the guns more so running and gunning is less effective and overall i hope they take notes from csgo game can be great hope they never make it pay to win and id be happy to pay 10$ for this game myself easily also lless cheaters than legendary eagle matchmaking in csgo so thats a plus
22343,"真的外掛不抓
純手動的動不動就被系統偵測外掛踢下線
不錯喔

real hack , they will not ban.
they will ban those who are really powerful.
fking shit mechanism."
22344,I defs recommend this game!! I have never had more fun playing an FPS game then this one. At times it will make you RAGE! (which if you like raging then this game is for you). It's pretty much a CS:GO/Call of Duty mash up. I just wish there were Australian servers so that way im not lagging my tits off in some of the games I play (most of the time it runs smoothly).
22345,"Black Squad plays out like CSGO, except faster, with more weapons, attachments, and the ability to aim down sight. Basic mechanics like movement/quickswitching/inventory system, etc are almost identitcal to CSGO's. You run faster with your knife out and there is even a keybind for inspecting your weapon.

Pros:
+Shooting feels good. Kills feel satisfying and meaty. Aim and reaction time are rewarded.
+Extremely sniper-friendly. Sniper rifles are significantly more powerful than the AWP is in CSGO. 
+Extremely well-optimized. 144hz supported. 
+Very good graphics for a F2P game. Animations/textures/viewmodels are superb.
+Very player-friendly F2P model. Vast majority of ingame weapons are easily obtainable with normal currency.
+Decent maps. People complaining about the small maps are talking about the deathmatch maps.
+Wide set of options; decent built-in crosshair optimization.
+Multiple interesting and unique gamemodes. Defuse, VIP assassination, etc.
+Battleye anticheat is more robust than VAC.
+Pretty good netcode. Hit registration seems very solid.

Cons:
-Not enough weapons; they will surely keep adding weapons.
-Deathmatch maps are too small.
-Grenade physics/rental system are worse than CSGO's.
-No ranked competitive system; this may come in the future.

Play this game. It could easily be 15 dollars, but it's free."
22346,"Its a good game, but it doesnt let me past the tutorial? Help me!"
22347,aussie servers please
22348,"In my short time playing I only encountered shit ping, wallhacks and terrible shooting. The guns feel weightless. You only unlock certain items like grenades for a 4 days. There are other free games that are halfway decent."
22349,Awesome game
22350,"Can't say I'd recommed this to anyone as of yet.

SMG's seem to overpower any other gun, so most players are just running around and jumping holding left click...pretty annoying.

Edit: Whoa baby. Devs are assholes, the mods are assholes. The only good part about this game is uninstalling it. 

Later fuckers."
22351,"Black Squad. the game that brings you back to those TF2 / MW2 days where fighting against a team was fun!

It brings back all the basic enjoyments of those two games such as 

Speratic movements , one shot kills , camping , kids saying they fucked your mother.... ok maybe not the last one 

But its not all fun. They CLEARLY state in the description  Absolutely no Pay-to-Win BUT as soon as you log in there is a 

MASSIVE Pay To Win System called BULLETS, with bullets you can spend money on more expensive weapons

But to counter this the game gives you around 300k when you first start it!

But then it take several matches to get back all those points you want to spend.

But on any note its fun but needs lots of work will update upon full release.

ALSO FIX THE FUCKING HACKERS"
22352,Type-95 is op
22353,Nice
22354,nice
22355,DO something about the aimbots and wallhacks or your game is not going to last
22356,"GENERIC? well, 10 years ago this game would have been generic, now its better described as archaic

if you ever got to try any korean f2p shooter in the past, then you have already played this one
its just like you imagine it from the screenshots and trailers, the same old formula of CS combined with COD, its so tried and true, its basic, its stale, its uninspired

and on top of it, the presentation its really bad, this game looks like a parody you would see on a gamingshow making fun of the genre, everything about it reeks mediocrity, like they are not even trying 

its that sensation you get from bootleg chinese toys, or those awful movies that old B list action stars from the 90s do nowadays to make ends meet like van damme or steven seagal

the art direction its super bland and boring, the voice acting its laughable and weird, the music its really cringy and repetitive, the sounds seem to be free stock ones, levels are barren and pathetic warehouses, military compounds and the ones that arent, look like artificial sets for training inside a military compound and then theres this dumb and boring gamemode where you have to stab big crates with the knife 

maps are really mediocre one stage arenas, the games are overcrowded with players, pings are all over the place and you will find people playing from south asia and the very ends of south america and weapon balance looks very questionable tosay the least

super light on content even if it has been said that this its an already stablished game in korea so they just need to localize content

in summary, no, just NO"
22357,Great FPS
22358,"SUCKS
"
22359,"um fix the servers plz, lag when my ping is hella good"
22360,You should really play this game its really fun and free! its worth the time waiting downloading
22361,"A great free-to-play game and best of all, the devs actually go through feedback threads and make improvements to the game based on common opinion, such as adding the AK12, Clan War channels, SEA server, etc. They're great, this game is great, it's great."
22362,This is a game that is good
22363,"please make for asian server, its boring with such lagging when playing in europe server.

good game btw ,ggwp"
22364,I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!!!! THX FOR CREATING IT!!!!
22365,"This game is so cool and fun, but with all the Hackers in everysingle game that you start, it just ruins the mood on the overall game it self."
22366,"it's alright, just another free too play game."
22367,Spawn camping and hacks.  Enough said
22368,"Its a pretty darn eccelent game. Its free, its not pay to win, you get tons of daily rewards, and every kill you get feels very rewarding! I just started playing but im not quiting any time soon."
22369,"Soo,
I played the game for some minutes.
-  First Match i entered was full of Hackers. 
- There is in my opinion not a good Anti-Cheat-System, The only way you can engage against Hackers is to block them.
+ You get enough gold to buy at least weapon Permanent 
+/- Concept Looks good but the way of fullfilling it is bad.
- The tutorial is more like ""Let me take your hand and hold the rifle for ya"""
22370,The game not adding in a way to kick or report people makes the game lose the bit of fun it had when I run into a hacker with a bottomless clip rocket launcher
22371,"Horrid experience. Copy and past of the cs weapons along with the recoil patterns. Smokes don't fully smoke. Grenades can one shot someone but a headshot can't. (Most if not every FPS game that has an grenade, the grenade does not do more damage than a headshot from any gun). You can run and gun with every gun and it doesn't matter what the spray pattern is. Some angles are over powered and is only a one way angle so to speak. (They can see you but you can still not see them which makes the maps that have these angles very broken and unfair once notified about.) I do NOT see this game becoming anymore of what it already is. A F2P game that will slowly force on micro transactions due to having a lot of hype but a very embarrassing launch."
22372,pretty good for a f2p game.
22373,great game
22374,"If you play this game, then you've pretty much played all free-to-play shooters our there.

- it tries to be like CoD, BF and CSGO at the same time and fails horribly
- the maps are a complete mess (each team has a few corridors that lead to the enemy's spawn, which means that there is a lot of spawntrapping)
- problems while logging in or searching for a game
- all weapons are the same and you feel no difference weither it's an SMG, AR or MG
- the gunplay is really crap, it is a twisted mess of ads and CS:GO like hipfire accuracy which makes ads irrelevant

The few good things about this game is that it has some ""ok"" visuals and it is a little fun for about half an hour before it becomes extremely boring and that you don't have to pay for the same guns that just look different.
"
22375,"This game is same like call of duty, but this game is so much better."
22376,"Help, Everytime I click ""Play Game"" It asks me to type my administrators password. I do that and it brings me to the game launch screen. I click on the ""Play"" button and the launch screen dissapears and nothing happens. I click ""Play Game"" in steam and the whole process repeats. How do I Fix??"
22377,its gud
22378,"Did a trial run of a few matches, very reminiscent of my call of duty days. 10/10 i would play this again and plan to do so."
22379,"Good free to play game by far, but once I got used to the controls I got a really good 8 kill streak in Battle Mode and got kicked for hacking. :S"
22380,Too many hackers and no Asian Region
22381,"Awesome game for party play so finally free version of cs... But looking for asian server!!!

Update
Already added sea an asia server . Gfx now has ultra details. So lit 💥

Update: still a nice game to play on INTREGATED/BUILD IN gfx,low specs pcs and laptops and to play with firends"
22382,yes i love killing and shooting i want 2 fuk clare :)
22383,FUCKIN TRASH
22384,"Game is definetly worth trying, its quick phase game with somewhat small maps. There is no pay to win in this game wich makes it more interesting for all players. There aren't any hackers, you get used to game realy realy quickly."
22385,"Really Boring, dont waste your time"
22386,"Black Squad is an interesting F2P modern military shooter in that it tries to be Counter Strike and CoD in the sense that it is very arcade-ish run n gun game play, though accuracy matters as headshotting someone in the right area can kill them instantly with most weapons due to the ""Fatal Crit"" system. Not to mention the game is extremely easy to pick up and play due to all weapons coming with every single attachment already and being rather affordable compared to most of the F2P games I've played...

Add the fact that getting shot doesn't slow you down, ADS does not penalize movement and hipfiring and ADS has roughly the same accuracy, and you have a formula that rewards skilled play, but is casual enough for even the most unskilled FPS player to contribute and you have a fairly unique Modern Military Shooter experience. 

That being said, outside of this, there's not much else that sets it apart from other Modern Military Shooters in the market, so if you're burnt out of the genre, you're not going to find much of interest here. Worst of all however, despite the Developers saying they are working hard on fixing the issue, is that Hackers are currently running rampant in the game, using Speed hacks, wall hacks, aimbots and the like to ruin everyone's fun by not only destroying them, but their PCs as well thanks to the explosion spam often causing even the game servers to become overloaded...

You can take the Devs' word for it, but considering how many devs lie these days, I would strongly avoid this game for now... Once (if ever) the hacker situation is settled, then I will change this review to recommended as it is honestly not a bad game, it's just currently being ruined by sad trolls currently stress testing the servers as well as everyone's patience with their shitty hacks..."
22387,"Currently, the playerbase may get ""tilted"" from playing with players with 200+ ping, but this will be fixed eventually.
Guns are fairly balanced, except for SMG damage long range ex/ mp7 & spx. Once the developers fix the jumping accuracy, crouch spam, and walking/running accuracy this game will be very enjoyable! If you place an smg in the virtual hands of a decent aimer, they can just hold w and jump corners and control the round. Give that tactic to 5 decent aimers and the game is theirs. Again, I do think guns are balanced, but it's the movement accuracy that ""buffs"" the smgs/snipers.

All of this is coming from a guy who's been playing since the first day of Closed Beta and continues to play the game daily. Overall, I think the game is a 3/5, but don't get me wrong, it is a great game so far! The game is still in its Newborn Stage here in NA, but I can't wait to see how it develops! With a couple changes, this can be the best f2p fps game to come to NA.

ingame name - Janks"
22388,literally first game matched up against a team full of hackers. nice game.
22389,"thanks the new update was lit!!!

comptitve match  we are 3 vs 5 gg black squad


and the game now full cheaters 

And i have lag for no reason 

Ping 90 fps 75 still lag 

good job u done well"
22390,"Black Squad is like.. COD, CSGO and Unreal thrown in a blender. The movement will throw any veteran shooter off tho.
Your insticts will be holding you back from running and gunning, while that is exactly what you should be doing in this game. Don't worry about steadying your rifle, just aim roughly at the enemy, and start your spraying while dodging, weaving and jumping to keep out of your enemy's crosshair. Classic spray and pray, baby!

The game definately still has its flaws tho, and some of them are... gamebreaking, sadly.
I'm writing this review after having played this for only two hours, but I can say I've seen enough to be able to speak about the contents of it. While keeping in mind this game is still in Beta, there's still a LOT of work to do.

The guns are, well, all in all pretty decent, even tho I'm missing some ""classics"" like the m4, the ak etc. The shop GUI where you ""buy"" new guns with the credits you earn in game could also definately use more ""order"". The way the different ""versions"" of the same base gun are shown can get a little confusing for new players, and not everyone will bother looking into them in detail.

The maps.. I feel like they're too small.. Less is more, and the lack of clutter and props does create a clean environment to just pick and shoot, but the maps could really use some extending, especially in Team Deathmatch.

Then, the players. So far, I've only played two hours on the NA servers, and most of my interactions were positive. Lots of new players at the moment trying this game out, that probably contributes as well.

But then the gamebreaking stuff.. 

Lobby's are just.. Weird.. The GUI could use a rework to make that part easier to access. Maybe add the abillity to make a game lobby before choosing gametypes etc, like most other FPS do it. 
Once you've finally gotten into the lobby with your friends, the real pain can begin.
Everyone ready's up, and we launch the game. At this point, 3 of us flip a coin. If any of our 3 coins gets a head, we'll get a hacker in the game.
Playing online is like playing a game of chance. If you're lucky enough to get into a game that doesn't have a hacker, you'll enjoy your game. 
Being a Free to Play game also means anyone can make an account, download hacks, and boom...
The lack of decent antihack software is genuinely game breaking, and needs to be addressed as soon as possible if this game is to survive.
I'm really talking, gamebreaking.. Just played three 16v16 games in a row, ONE of them we didn't have a hacker and had fun, the next game a hacker destroyed all the boxes under 2 mins. Somehow he was able to slice 15-20 times per second with his knife.
The next game another guy made the previous guy look like a newbie tho. This guy somehow managed to end the 16vs16 game under 30 seconds.
Now THAT'S impressive.
Sadly, there's no way to ""flag"" or report ingame at all, and there's no connection between steam and the game playerwise. As a legit player, for now, you'll just be forced to endure, and pray for that one match where you get don't get a hacker.

Pro's:

- Free to play
- Fun change from the classic FPS games most people play nowadays
- Wooden PC? NO PROBLEM!
- Solid engine, so fast loading times etc

Con's

- Messy GUI
- Run&Gun only, even with snipers
- Small maps
- No or badly functioning hack detection system which leads to a horrible online experience


Do you recommend this game?

For now.. I couldn't recommend it.. Until it makes up on the anti hack detection, where it completely missed the ball, I'd even say this game is almost unplayable.

It's a very solid base to build further on, but it's definately not there yet.



I'll edit this review after a few updates"
22391, No money for CS: GO ? SAY NO MORE..
22392,Bunch of hackers already and the game has no anti cheat or report feature so these hackers are free to do whatever.
22393,"Wow! Free 2 play and it's that good? Damn boi , btw bring more maps guys"
22394,"Working exploits easily found on youtube and the best game mode called ""Battle Mode"" is completely ruined by cheaters using Lawnmower knife cheats (20 knife hits in 1 second) Destroying game objectives way faster then they should be.
Oh I forgot to mention...There's no way to report the people using the exploits either."
22395,nice
22396,Only Fucking CHEATERS !!! Support down
22397,so many hacker please fix it
22398,"its very fun its like a mix of COD and CSGO i realy recomend ths game
"
22399,"EDITED:  Can't play a single round without hackers now, not recommended until they fix this, will readjust recommendation if it gets fixed.

Early Access Review:

Overall a decent free to play FPS.  Here's my pros/cons so far.  There is no neutral choice so I will recommend it, but it's close.  

Pros:

Good graphics and music
No crashes so far
Permanant weapons once  you buy
Not Pay to Win
Variety of game modes and a handful of maps to play on
Classes to help customize how you play (only in one game mode)
Reasonable free player progression
Playable on my slower connection without too much lag

Cons:
Hackers...and more hackers.  Folks ending game modes by blowing up the entire map in 10 seconds. 
No in game way to report hackers (do they care?)
Classes only suported in one game mode.
Weapons not customizable.  They have default attachments that you can use or not - silencers/laser sights

I feel it is a decent free to play game that is not Pay to Win.  If they can get the hacker problem under control it might be worth investing a little money in for preaty guns and characters."
22400,"This game how it stands now:
It feels clunky, slow; I did the tutorial (I could argue it could be more flexible, but it does what it's suposed to) all good up to here, first match I join I was paired agenst a hacker, and niether of us was able to report him in the game. But I brushed that game off and played another, paired again with another hacker.
I just got tired if it all quickly, once this game gets a major update or fixes these problems I will come back to write another review.

"
22401,Absolutely ruled by hackers devs don't seen to give one shit. No Anti-cheat if devs do somthing it could be good but there letting it die. Do not recommend this game!!! If they cant even handle a anti cheat they dont deserve funding its a joke.
22402,Really good game.
22403,fun game!!!!!
22404,"A mix between cod and cs. Good and fast gameplay with a high skill ceiling. Easy to get into, and truly a f2p game and not p2w. The game is very well optimized easy to get up to 200 fps. I've read that a lot of people are complaining about cheaters, I personally haven't gone up against a single one (that I know of) so I can't agree with their statements. I mean, if you compare the game to cs go there are almost no cheaters at all."
22405,i Like it alot
22406,Good game except for the fact that 9/10 times you will encounter a hacker on battle match
22407,Add more pistols.
22408,Counter Strike with a pointless ADS Mechanic and and Loadout presets. Was fun for a few hours.
22409,"This is like a COD:MW but only multiplayer. I noticed some bugs but I can live with it. The recent update stopped the hackers and the matchmaking is faster now. Great Job! I hope you can add some more maps especially in the battle match.

PROS:
1. This can be played on old laptops (30-36 fps is not bad)
2. Free to Play (with In-Game purchases) BUT, most of the weapons are affordable as long as you keep on playing for coins and medals.
3. Many weapons and nice control layout.

CONS:
1. Sometimes, you enter a game that has started or halfway (LAME IF YOU ARE ON THE LOSING TEAM ALREADY)
2. Jump from high places doesn't damage you (in-my case)
3. No Asia server (HIGH PING KICKS ME ALL THE TIME)
4. The damaging system is kinda questionable (people are so hard to kill even though i am hitting them hard)

This game has alot of potential and a must play!

UPDATE: Hoping for asia servers soon! :)"
22410,"This is a really cool game! You can really have a good time while playing this :D 
I hope the devs launch Asian servers too :)
Sad thing is, this game will also be ruined by hackers soon :( Hope the devs use VAC or a good anti-cheat!
Do play the game!"
22411,Great game. Full of action!
22412,Very good game 9/10 xD
22413,Just need more guns. Nice game.
22414,<3
22415,"So far out of five matches 2 out of 5 there is a hacker in the match and it is bloody annoy to play since you get fucking headshoted once you step out of spawn.  But its a free game, you can try it out without any risk and see for yourself."
22416,"Very Good game with the best graphic.

Better than CS GO ;)
"
22417,Its Lit!
22418,"Everytime I join a server, It is disaster to play in Australia. My ping went high up just like a Space Shuttle. But great game though"
22419,"Nice game with 5v5 or 8v8, DM, assasination... BUUUTTT after playing for a bit and already finding hackers and before you say l2p explain me how?
When you get in a match where a random dude pulls out a simple gun and fires 30 rounds/s and every round explodes like a  granade (seriously?).
And not to mention their knifes with 100 mile range.
Aim bots.
Its really sad and you cant report them or anything (or just i didnt found a way). 
After such matches with hackers, fun just gets drained out and all you want to do is quit it."
22420,"My first words for review? DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!
Here is my review, the Black Squad Devs are money leeches, i tried 4 random boxes and i emptied all of them and NOT 1 box gave me the colored gun, they say is there, but it ain't, also we are having a lot of hackers and the Devs don't even care, now the way the whole CLAN thing is setup is a total WAIST of time, you can't even chat withiin your own clan, because that don't have a chatbox within the clan, there is no way to do anything in this game, it's like youi are their prisoner, and when they say jump. you say how high, well i say good fucken bye.
The score out of 10? i would give it a 3, the game is all about them making money of you, and when you need to get somethings, most of it is TIME LIMITED, I lost already $100 AUD and you will too."
22421,"MM pretty broken, 250 ping players on NA servers; interpolation gives high pingers very little disadvantage."
22422,"This game is good and all, but the problem is we need a kick button."
22423,"Buys assault rifle with grenade launcher - Gets 10 kills and 20 Deaths.

Interesting.

Buys LMG - Gets 42 kills and 16 deaths/

Interesting.

10/10 Would spray and pray"
22424,"This game is very similar to another F2P title. Ghost In The Shell: FA. When it comes to weapons and map flow. Some weapons are a mix of CSGO in the recoil department(AR and Snipers) and COD when it comes to the SMG's and Shotguns(Just like Ghost In The Shell). The maps are just plain bad, and very easy to get spawn trap regardless of the spawn protect shield just like Ghost In The Shell. Didn't get a chance to test every weapon. But it seems majority of them are one shot kill to the head. So bunny hopping with SMG's will net you a headshot. I did very well in the game, ended up with a 1.6K/D with my 2hrs spent with the game and didn't enjoy it one bit.
"
22425,"too many cheaters for a not so special game 
its a 'meh' game."
22426,"No aus server, but looks good :("
22427,"In this game you will learn how to do the following: 

1) Spam EZPZ in the chat when your team won 150-149 
2) Trash talk to the other team when your winning by 1 point
3) Realise that most guns don't even have any recoil
4) See that the snipers are useless and hard to use
5) To waste all your money opening crates and getting nothing good
6) Spend all your life on this game and get headaches when you go outside
7) To lose all contact with family and to lose your social life
"
22428,I wouldt not recomennd this game until the hacker issue is fixed. each game you probably will have a hacker
22429,"UI is retarded, the first game I played had a cheater in it. it's just another f2p shooter with nothing special outside of one gamemode that's just alright. Don't waste your time. Every time I come back to see why it has so many more positive reviews I'm left confused because the game is so bad its actually unreal. Makes me appreciate owning not bad games."
22430,"i must say that i like the game,i have alot of fun,the gameplay is solid, the graphics are good
It's almost like CS GO or Skill but still
I recommend this game"
22431,"Good game, yall putting good work into it, keep it up."
22432,Can't even play 1 minute of a game online without it crashing.
22433,need asia server hurry
22434,i love the game but too many people began using hacks it became frustrating and not fun
22435,Bad For asia SO LAGGING
22436,Shoot em all
22437,"having in mind that the game is free to play it's quite a nice game without any game-breaking bugs. If the devs will implement viable anti-cheat, would recommend for people who can't afford any paid games :)"
22438,great game so far... discord server to find games >>>>>> https://discord.gg/xqA2NHa <<<<<<<
22439,"简单地说，这个游戏中可以叫做交叉火力或空白点2.
事实上，穷人的射击，穷人的物理的手榴弹，彩色的烟雾，野生差异的武器和多的所有♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 中。
玩的是不是建议，甚至与朋友，破坏心情他们自己和队友。"
22440,"GREAT F2P FPS!

Pro:
High FPS
Speed play is fast, good for player faster
Weapon permantly and another connected feature
High power of setting of the display and gameplay
Other PRO when you launch new patch.

Negative:
Cheats
Hacker
Impossible play 5+ player/friend with invite (for now)
No Ping limit for match
No IP limit for server

Need:
- Report/kick during play match
- Invite 5+ player on lobby for play 16vs16 or other mode
- Visibility of the lobby for choice and join a match
- Check matchmaking for now isn t very good, gold and high sergent team vs 1-2 lv of sergent? mmh
- Pay battleye for combat **** cheater, destroy your game and bad advertise.

I have play all neowiz game, please repair this error and follow people for best life of this game.
Good luck and my english is very bad.  :D 


"
22441,"This should be a mobile game. Graphics, controls, and design are total shit."
22442,"The game is great, the graphics is great, the gameplay is great overall i will give a score of 7/10 it'll be a 10/10 if the game will have SEA Server i hope this very soon its irritating to play on NA server which i have better ping lol 250-280 is better kinda sad but still i love the game and hoping will have a SEA Server SOON! ;)"
22443,Worst game ive ever played. Like really really bad guns do half the damage they should and does it even have anti cheat.
22444,Graphics are great even on low end pc's
22445,"It's a good game but please don't make the game available to regions like Asia when you don't have any servers for it, will rate up if there's one.

[i]We have been listening heavily on the voice of the community.[/i]

-Devs"
22446,"Они на деревьях, Джони! Читергуки, это они!"
22447,battlemode is a lot of fun... if it wasnt for that game mode then i would choose counterstrike over this... still a good game...
22448,"For an early access game, it seems like it's a pretty good build. However the matchmaking has a big problem. There's no way to invite your friends into a party, or none that I found."
22449,No.
22450,"If you want the worst of call of duty mixed with the worst of CS:GO, all with a horrible mobile game interface, this is the game for you. If you’re looking for a good f2p non pay to win fps, do yourself a favor and try dirty bomb."
22451,"For only playing for about half an hour, I'm already sold. A F2P shooter that's actually good? I love this. I seriously recommend this game to anyone who enjoys shooters. Graphics are great, mechanics are amazing, everything about this game is amazing. Can't wait to see what this game has in store for the future."
22452,game is too easy but there isnt any other f2p fps games that r alive.
22453,Every round is a hacker now. As of 8/8 literally unplayable unless you enjoy wall and aim hacks every round.
22454,"sosa and Obz are  1 shot one killing everyone without trying, please watch them"
22455,good stuff
22456,"(This is going to have more negatives than positives. I still entirely recommend this game, but it's for the developers so they know what to fix.) 

TL:DR Black Squad is a great game if you enjoy FPS with low system requirements. It's still in EA, so there all flaws; but even having said that, it's very enjoyable.

Pros:
- Not P2W in the slightest. The only thing you can spend real money on is cosmetics for the guns.
- Very low system requirements. As a person who has a low spec laptop I am greatful for this.
- Easy to pick up and play. It's not hard for a new player who is somewhat familiar with FPS games to do well.
- The graphics are good for the requirements, all of the maps have their own little flair even on the lowest settings.
- The servers are good. I rarely get over 100 ping and there is no skittering from my player model.
- The timed DLC for the weapons is a fantastic idea. It lets people use the weapons in real games to determine what to buy with the gold they earn.

Cons:
- I found my first hacker today, I left immediately, and got a deserter token for it. (The hacker had teleport, infinite ammo, rapid grenade launcher, etc.)
- Even though the servers are good and I don't see skittering, I feel that when I peek a corner and hide back I still die from behind the wall; It might just be me, but it get's aggrivating when it happens multiple times.
- The game modes state a player count. Ex. Demolition 5v5. Even when it says 5v5, three more people can join to make it a 8v8; This is also misleading and ruins the feel of the game mode.
- The TDM maps are extrememly small. I can run out of spawn in all the maps and still get shot by people with invincibility; so I stopped playing TDM.
- While you're dead you cannot give you team callouts in chat. Hopefully this will be implemented fully or at least ranked if/when it comes out.
- There are only 2 pistols in the game that I'm aware of. I bought the deagle with metals, and it won't even kill somebody with 3 headshots; this is rediculous."
22457,"Decent shooter, nice balanced weapons and good maps. I mainly play TDM and its very enjoyable.

Edit: Absolutely plauged with hackers at the moment.. needs patching ASAP."
22458,"This is an okay choice for a free FPS. It has somewhat lag but it's better than most, it feels like a mix of CS:GO and Call Of Duty. It has many choice of guns and unlike csgo you can actually hip shot and hit stuff but you also need to crouch, walk, a-d a-d spam to not die quickly.

Reccomended for low balance FPS gamers."
22459,Not sure what i expected from a free to play title but this is just another fps with maps that are too small and full of grenade spam. Constantly dying in my own base to grenades that can be thrown from the opposing base xD... most ridiculous thing ive ever seen. Keep up the good work free to play titles.
22460,"This game feels refreshing, the guns feel powerful and the kills satifying this game just needs a few more maps and the ability to change class during a round.z"
22461,sO FUN AND ITS GREAT YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
22462,maps r 2 small.
22463,"it's a fun little game. kinda like a mix between cod and csgo, but it's free. you don't have to spend any real money unless you want special character models that are purely cosmetic. So nobody is just buying their way to 1st place.
 
It's free so you might as well give it a try."
22464,So far i've played a weeks worth of game and this is what i don't like... Ok first thing i find annoying when your aiming down the sight of your gun then you reload your gun it doesn't go back to aiming down the sights. You have to click the right mouse button again.... Second i feel that the guns need more balancing when it comes to power. I brought the desert Eagle 50 AE with my medals... & my gun was more powerful than most other players guns. And they where killing me with no problem.. alos ammo capacity for hand guns are shit desert eagle being one of them. I feel maps need to be BIGGER people are in your area in seconds.. And last thing on my mind... for people that don't really have money to spend or buy those awesome weapons. With the (BS and Bulles) do what you do with the medals make.. us.. work.. for them. Again not everyone has money to blow up the wall. So for now I've uninstalled it for know but i will be keeping my eyes on things i do believe this game with be a success it just need more tweaking. So for NOW Tumbs down from Thank you for your time :)
22465,Black squad is a damn good game. I really hope the devs dont mess this one up because this game has some good potential  and its always fun with friends and getting killstreaks. Blacksquad is free so give it a try
22466,"Very fun and smooth fps thats also f2p, runs smooth and has a few different modes to play. Highly recomend to anyone who enjoys fps games!"
22467,"I give this game a 3/5

It is a beautiful game graphically and gameplay wise that balances f2p and micropurchases well.

It loses one star for the rampancy of cheating/hacking.

It loses another star because the menu and inventory systems are clunky.

The biggest downfall of the game is the amount of hacking/exploiting that goes on. From fully automatic AT4 launchers to aimbots/wallhacks.

Hopefully the devs can implement a better anti-cheat software or make reporting players more intuative. At the moment, I have no idea how to report players."
22468,"Great game a combination of cod and cs go and it can run 60 fps on almost any pc. Only like TDM and Demolition , in Assassination they need to add more ways for the hostage to escape and alow players to carry the hostage just like in cs go.  
Add more game modes similar to cod and the game will be ok :) Add capture the flag mode.  Don`t like the one shot knife from the front especially when the enemy is charging and you put some bullets in him and he still kills you with no movement penalization. The snipers are balanced since when you are scoped in and the enemy fires at you you get aim punch so no bs quick scope rush and the more damage the sniper has the less bullets you get and you move slower. AK12 fires way to slow so it`s not viable close range unless you have luck so basicly you can`t win if you get rushed by multiple players unless you only 1 tap hs and they miss most of their shots :) SMG is king close and mid range, rifle only make sense mid and long range.
Found 3-4 hackers in 21h gameplay and managed to unlock 500k gold and 2500 medals  so it is not P2W , sure medals takes some time but you can get any gun , you pay only for skins. 
The EU public servers are hosted in Frankfurt so most of the EU players shoud have good ping since all major ISP have border routers in Frankfurt. Since i heard the developer on twitch wanted to know players pings here are mine on EU servers: lowerst ping is 56 , avrage is 60 (99% of the time) and highest was 70 on FTH 300Mbps down 150Mbps up.
 Add demo recording and console just like cs go. Add the option for player in TDM to keep the weapon he got from the enemy (add F4 buy menu so players can chose if they want to keep the enemy weapon) if the previous round was won with the player still alive. The game must have more country flags banners. Add the ability to see in the profile section the players steam profile from in game or chat.
A major bug: sometime the player can`t trow the grenade and after that the swich to primary weapon is delayed.
* Update:
Now the game has ping limit implemented at max 200 :D Demolition and Assassination needs to implement a longer ping check so the game start shoud be delayed to allow more players to join , in my opinion if in the lobby are less then 8 players the game shoud not start and auto team balance based on players ranks shoud be implemented because it`s not fair if a higher rank player disconnect due to lag and a noob one takes his place or the game starts with no team balance what so ever and the disconnects can meke it even worse. SMG are way weaker. Don`t like the developer removed the flags to not offend snowflakes.
Update june 2018:
-now my ping is 99% below 50ms
- now the game has skins and cases = free money for player and developer 
- don`t like that they added a weapon : AK ZHUKOV  that can only be obtain via unboxing the frontier case or via bs coins but to be fair it has the same stats as ak only the model and scope is diffrent
- the grenade not releasing bug it`s not fix but it dosn`t happens often
Update june 2019: 
- got the AK ZHUKOV as a reward after 50 competitive matches
Suggestions: the box in a box system is ok but maybe the developer can add some rare cases that require a key to open that are dropable just like in cs go but make sure the drop rate is low and the content is nice.
- add option to equip diffrent skins for the Viper Circle side and Peace Maker side , just like cs go CT/T skins , i like my knife to match my camo :) maybe you can make it for the character skins.
- if a player picks a weapon from the ground and he wins the round he shoud be able to keep the gun for the next round but have an option to equip a weapon from his f1-f2-f3 presets prior to the round timer and after the gun he picked from the previous round shoud pe droped so any team member can pick it up , again just like cs go
- increase the bs coin reward for competitive matches to 200 and for the gold box drops from 10 to 50
-add flags back and even better add option to coustumioze existing cards with the flag in diffrent positions so players can pick the spot just like cs go stickers , also why not implement stickers for the weapons ? more free money for the developer and players
- the GL skins shoud be available to the non GL version of the weapons
In my opinion the skins from the gold box shoud be available only for one year and after be replaced by new ones , also it wasn`t very nice they make the gold box skin unmarketable and untradable but they did allow a period before they maked the change  , the best solution is to make them like tf2 vintage items and at least make them tradable , so people can trade if they like an item from the gold box.
- add an option to transform the unused temporary event weapons drops to 10% of the spent points used to open the event case , i rarely try the temp event weapons so they will go to waste :)
Destruction mode can be unbalanced and lots of players don`t forcus on the points so maybe add a small  tutorial on this mode ....
update 2020:
- you never make the items not tradeable if you want a decent game economy especially skins from cases. This has affected the market and all skin prices have dropped.
-no punishment for PVE leavers , on hard if you have one leaver the remaining players should recive a boost in damage or the objective be more resistant to enemy AI attacks , i don`t want to waste my time because of retarded leavers.
-PVE on hard reward is to low 
- I don`t like the developer removed the case key rewards...
Update 30 october 2020: 
So now Valofe owns the game and they decided to once again do the same stupid move but this time they decided to make all skins untradable and unmarketable. A slap in the face of the players who invested in skins , opened cases and participated in the events. They argue the steam market monetization was not profitable , how can a 10% cut not be profitable? Sure it was less profitable since they removed the skins in the past and the market droped like a rock but whos fault was that?  Maybe steam wanted a bigger cut of their key sales but again that is no reason to close the market and also make all skins untradable.
I sold all my skins and almost all of my cases and i will never buy any cosmetic item , i was lucky to make a profit since i read the news 17 hours later :) , i wish i had sold when i last updated this review but my lost in profit  was under 3$ since i didn`t own many  high tier skins , glad i didn`t spend money to open cases and i got rid of most of my cases prior to this. I feel sorry for the players who opened cases , bought items from the market and for players who didn`t know about this update in time and got stuck with worthless skins because of the scumbag move to only allow so little time before the change.
I send suggestions to the developer years ago about the game economy and how to fix it but none got integreated in the game. I send some questions to the developer , will update the review if i get an answer.
Update: after i ask how can 10% steam market cut is unprofitable and why they made the items Not Tradable and Not Marketable i got this lame answer from valofe support:
With regards to your question, we cannot spill any information as stated on FAQ: Besides the known in-game information, asking an update details, an update schedule, or the information, which cannot be revealed due to the security / protection / privacy / nature of the game-design, may lead to a limited answer, or may not be answered."
22469,"FULL of hackers and people with absolutely shit ping. Like, 200+ plus ping. I yes, I know they are hacking because there is no weapon that can shoot 20 grenades in rapid sucession."
22470,"Just a basic free to play firstperson shooter.
Great Game if you just bought a PC and dont have any money to buy anything else
"
22471,"Played Game for about 20 mins,Quickscoped Everyone on the sv.Got spammed for ""Cheating"" 11/10 Will get 50 kills again 8-)"
22472,Black Squad has a lot of potential to become a really great FPS. I cannot wait to see what the devs have in store for the future.
22473,gg
22474,"- greedy devs removed skins from tradability (*)

- cash grab game for parents pockets

- ignore the positive reviews, its from little fanboys.

- game is a waste of time. (game already dying, check steamcharts)

* everything you need to know about dev mindset

+ recommendation play CS:GO its free

"
22475,nice game not too much p2w
22476,No
22477,lOVE IT AND ITS FREE LOL.
22478,"looks ok :) (for free) graphic is not best ...but the game runs great :o)  (looks fair ...and i like fair games)

the game looks simple but playable :) (looks like there isnt cheaters like in others shooter games....so you can check your real skill :) ...and for me it looks easy on begining ...because i win 7/8 matches ...and i was mostly on top :) (but i play only team deathmatch) its simply not bad shooter game for ""realx"" ;) 

(i dont see there pay to win much...the 1st weapon its already ok :) when you check stats )

[sry for basic english]"
22479,"Amazing.
Call of Duty replica. 
Amazing"
22480,"For the time i've played this game, it was fun. That is if you put aside the constant fucking hacking."
22481,its a no from me
22482,full of fucking scum hackers
22483,"this game was great....for about a week and than hackers ruined it for me. instead of playing it and getting their skill up, it's aimbots or rapid fire at4 or other bullshit hacks. if the devteam would put a hack shield on it than you will get pissed off fast. as of this moment i'm unstalling this game. was fun but now it's a hackers playground"
22484,"The game is fun and it's satisfying getting a kill, the sound is perfect. However the one shot kill guns are so crap, it completely ruins the game, oh you have to either grind like crazy to get the gun, or buy it with real money, so in a way this is very much a pay to win model. 
Adding guns like this makes people want it to have a crazy advantage and so they'll pay, so I get why the devs did it, however by doing such as completely and utterly ruined the game for me, it's not fun being one shot camped at your base over and over.
I'd pay £15 quid for this game had they just allowed you to use all the guns and balance it more, so people who pay money don't rape you so easily."
22485,"This game is fucking ass. I'm talking GOD TIER garbage. Why? Their website says ""Rise of the real FPS"" while all I'm seeing is bullet sponges and a small map for breeding base rape. Do not download this game please. There is more quality put into the trailer then the actual game itself. It's a shame to call this a rise of REAL fps. Deadass this game is generic and boring. Save your storage. You'll thank me."
22486,Game full of hackers.
22487,I can see the future of this game it reminds me of those crossfire special foce and assualt force days plzz devs make yer AC gud this game has so much potential in it
22488,"Was pretty hyped for this game to come out, but it's basically a bad remake of cs:go with really few weapons"
22489,good game for shity pcs
22490,"Hackes as far as the eye can see...

SMG is just spraying...

Snipers are just campers or just running around quickscoping...

Grenades has little bounce or roll...

Some guns require little to no skill....

I know the devs are trying their best right now, BUT for ""now"" the game is a heaping pile of garbage. I still have hopes for this game, if I start to see improvements, I will change my review.


In the meantime, I'll just keep playing against hackers and sprayers."
22491,"Pros:
 +Seems to run well and probably will work on most low grade computers
 +No P2W elements
 +F2P
 +Only 5.48 GB Hardrive Space
 +Option to buy permanent guns with in game money.
 +NA, SA, and EU servers (Most FPS games don't have SA servers which causes a lot of lag and ping problems)
  
Cons:
 -Game looks very dated graphics wise and personally gave the impression of looking a bit more impressive
 -Hackers like most F2P games (7/10 games had one but only one was a game breaking hacker that sped around our spawn killing us)
 -Gameplay seems to try to be a mix of most F2P FPS games but doesn't mix well. 


Good game for those with a older or cheaper computer most likely. Personally I might not play it very often and wasn't really hooked playing. Hope it continues to improve and doesn't adapt with the modern P2W money grabs most companies do and won't get rid of the permanent duration guns."
22492,"It's alright.

It's fun as a free to play and non-competitve game, but I don't really see the game going anywhere."
22493,Its dope af. You should honestly get it
22494,"Except for the Hackers, this game is pretty good"
22495,I Honestly love this game but they should add in weapon customizations for us and add more guns! :)
22496,"If you do good your first few games, you'll be put on the losing team with a low rank every single time. Game will load you in a 3v5 in demolition at the start which gives you a losing edge almost every single time."
22497,"reminds me of counter-strike go, just with updated graphics.

fast spaced FPS with modern weapons, even better, you just respawn when you are killed during team deatch match, something you need a mod for at CS.  i am hooked.

i have not figured out the buying and selling yet but the weapons you can get or try out are decent."
22498,"A game where no skill is involved, bassically run into a wall of bullets get a few kills die respawn repeat. There is no respawn time either so death holds no impact. I only played the TDM mode though. I can say the games main menu is trash and its got the typical free to play in your face pay model. luckily it doesnt seem to be pay too win. with the starter weapons I consistently came in first or second though that may have been because it seemed like every weapon I spotted on the ground from dead people were also just the starter weapons. I did notice you can pay for better armor types which is annoying and some people were taking a tad bit more ammo to kill than others. All in all its another typical FTP shooter thats fun to waste for about 30 mins on if youve got better games in your inventory or a entry level game you can spend ours on if youve got little in terms of money. Its the top of the bottom of the barrel or in otherwords a tollerable FTP game. Not a good one but playable."
22499," +1000 points for the devs for making it free-to-play.
playable more than most of pay to play games, I liked it, had a good first impression (in battle) but still needs a LOT of work regarding the interface, everything needs to be rearranged and fixed, also regarding the shop section its like omg so much chaos and too many ways to buy a weapon which in my opinion needs to be removed, like I don't need to buy a weapon with medals, golds, bullets, coins.. what the hell bro lol, just one or 2 ways is enough. 
regarding the weapons I liked them too, but some weapons needs nerfing their ranges are too high eventhough they're supposed to be mid-ranged weapons. all in all, I loved the game truely. I already bought some stuff (just for the support) and if you're to ever open a crowd funding ingame or on steam I am willing to support you again. (I hope you will)."
22500,"THe best F2P shooter I have ever played/

Holy fuck it is CQC Combat at its best.
Nice small Maps that you Learn quickly, statisfying guns to use and hella rewarding gameplay.

I recommend it to anyone if you like shooters."
22501,"This game still needs a lot of work, but after playing it for just under two hours, I can already see that this is just another tactical shooter with no new mechanics and lacks stimulating gameplay. Please don't waste your time with this.
Pros:
-Gunplay is okay at best
-Guns are balanced
-Graphics are great

Cons:
-Level design is bad
-No armor in the market
-Gameplay is fun for two minutes, and then it just gets boring
-Small choice of game modes (only 5)
-Menu interface is cluttered
-Only three match types: Quick Play, Competitive (only if you're part of a clan), and Training (training isn't good at all)
-Small number of maps
-It's just not enjoyable

This game advertises itself as the best free to play shooter on the market. Well, that's not true at all. In my opinion, games like Warface, Dirty Bomb, and even Team Fortress 2 are the best free shooters on the market. This game is a waste of your time, and you'll most likely end up uninstalling it after a few hours."
22502,This game has very high potential but the online multiplayer has too small maps and spawns are too close together which create spawn camps but yes there is spawn timer for when you spawn you have a shield for 3 seconds but you need better spawns and more health
22503,nearly 0 recoil and the movement feels like f2p aswell after 2 rounds boring.
22504,"No anticheat, first game was a cheater going nuts on the enemy team.

Uninstalled.  GG"
22505,"It's lit
"
22506,"No Votekick/Report system in F2P game full of hackers. lul

Other than that, it's quite good."
22507,Salam
22508,I would pay money to play this game i love it
22509,"This game is amazing as soon as it actually goes competitive.
Once they add a SEA server as well as a better South America server.

Hackers will be dealt with once BattleEye is fully established.

Also once the game does go competitive im sure third party anti-cheat clients will come about."
22510,"The game just needs time
The developers are cool
They do their best
If you have less than 1 hour, don't write reviews, just play some more."
22511,"literally gave me cancer in 2 rounds

0/10 never again"
22512,too many hackers
22513,"Black Squad is a well done game. The graphics are great and are able to be converted to  work even on lower end devices. This game seems to try and become the next ""Counter Strike"" sort of game as it has similair traits. The only problem with this game, which you will notice if you download it, is that the community is lacking. People are barely playing this game, if there are even people who play it. This becomes a problem because multi-player is the only way (besides the tutorial and playing on empty maps by yourself) of actually playing the game. Therefore i really hope the developers will release something such as a campaign or single-player to bring the game back to life. Even though the main core of the game is disfuntional i would still recommend it. this game, as mentioned earlier, has potential. There is also a chance you can still find some people willing to play. if not, then just invite a friend and you will see how much fun this game is even with 2 people.

[EDIT]: The community of this game is very active, i just misunderstood the multiplayer system. this game truly has potential"
22514,Poor man Black Ops. GG.
22515,Basically the better and cheaper version of CS:GO if you ask me.
22516,"It's a great game, really good potential, but I don't recommend this game right now and here's why. Two issues: One, there are spelling errors out the wazoo (not the main reason though); Two, there is no anticheat. If you play Battle Match, 50% of the time there will be someone with cheats ruining the game. Until there is anticheat, I'd stay away from this game unless you don't care. Other than that, great game. Different guns are cool, different streaks, not pay2win. Add anticheat and you have yourself a solid F2P FPS."
22517,"This game is pretty much CSGO, but with 2017 graphics and improved gameplay :)

It's for free and by far my favorite game.

Definitely worth getting! Not like it'll cost ya ;)"
22518,This game is amazing!
22519,"Do you like a balanced damage system and a fair matchmaking system with weapon balance that makes sense?

Then dont play this game.

also its full of hackers."
22520,It was a good game once back in 2019 before the game main company selling it to a shity company and got destroyed by cheators and admins banning randomly a lot of players
22521,very fun game can be really good.
22522,sucks really this game suck s
22523,"I think that this game is a very fun FPS, but you need to twek the settings a bit for example i needed to turn the sensitivity up a bit as well as change the colour of the crosshair from green to red. But that`s just personal. You run using the knife (3) by the way."
22524,6/9 Would die again.
22525,"""TAC RELOAD"""
22526,"Early access

csgo cod
You earn little to no gold through matchmaking and weapons are 200k gold"
22527,"generic boring  game that takes a little out of every other popular fps  even the maps u probably have seen them eslewhere  


oh and full of hackers 




3/10"
22528,Its the game modes that got me
22529,This game is amazingly fun. Only played it for 2 days but its already awesome to be honest. Haven't had any complaints about hackers or anything like the other reviews say but this game is awesome its almost like csgo exepct theres no like people turtling to get accuracy everytime they see someone lol. It's fun especially the battle matches where you can use your skills and destroy camps. I would rec this game to anyone of my friends that play csgo and or COD.
22530,"pls put asian servers, everyone getting 200+ ping in eu"
22531,"This game has great potential, unless they dont fix the speedy operators that can move fast as f when shooting, also the most annoying thing is that the bullets are made of rubber and dont do damage at all."
22532,Noice!
22533,"i saw the reviews and thought it would be a fun cs rip off, i was very wrong, the controls are terrible (not to mention you have to finish the tutorial to change them) the sensitivity is way too low at default."
22534,very good game i like it not ptw at all but we have problem about hackers pls improve the protection of the servers pls if that happens much people not gonna play anymore
22535,great for a free game enjoyable and not really a pay to win experiance
22536,"Great game

15 Great players

16 You enter a mach in a cuple of seconds

16 Play it now...its amazing :D"
22537,nice
22538,"This game is so much fun. I was pleasantly surprised because I thought it was going to be as bad as Tactical Intervention.
But its far from it. The gun play is easy and getting kills is very satisfying. Once more maps come out, this game will be amazing."
22539,Y U DO DIS?
22540,Do something against cheaters please
22541,"So i played Black Squad for 48 minutes now, its a great game but i feel like the snipers are a little bit op. But overall the game is great! it feels like Counter Strike tough. (If you read this you should try it)

- Sorry for my bad englando xd."
22542,i love this game
22543,"mediocre at best game, combined with servers full of 250+ ping numbs killing u behind walls."
22544,Very solid game that features good and easy to learn controls and really fun as well. 9/10 for me
22545,Its actually fun
22546,"Black squad is a shooting game being a bit similar to CS GO, but with more actions and selectable weapons. It is good based on its game modes, there are deathmatch, demolition and war mode.....etc. Silencer, lazers that you can use on weapons. You can also join clans to battle with your clanmates, unlike CS GO, it has a better community. But its graphic is not that good as CS GO, plus it is indeed not that realistic (gives you a feeling of mobile phones). Weapons in game are kind of expensive too. I would say it's a pretty good game to play, but it still has things that can be improved."
22547,I always wanted to be black
22548,"Players are shit, except the cheaters I came across, like Pvt.Hitler Top Kek
The game is weak, has no Vac or anything like that but it's a fun game IMO"
22549,"The game format of CS:GO with the weapon customisation of R6S. I can't fault it, but those other 2 games do it better. But considering it's free to play but NOT pay to win, who can complain? Also hipfire 1000 times more accurate than is humanly possible 10/10 would not scope again."
22550,If CoD and CSGO had an autistic child this would be it.
22551,It's a nice game
22552,good game
22553,"CS & CoD's retarded brother, but it's hella fun. It's free and not the biggest in file size, try it for yourself. People are also incredibly bad for some reason, so you can probably top frag every game if you played a shooter more then once in your life."
22554,"this game is like cs:go and blacklight retribution, only worse graphics, and few and shitty servers. 

although this is in early access so it could all change, if there is anything the devs should focus on though, it's the servers.
any online game is HORRIBLE with high ping.

also the health thing, few (or none) game modes having healing, and you have very low health. so in situations where you are the last man standing it can be very hard to do anything without dying. CS:GO does this well though, and it gives you armor, but this game doesn't."
22555,Meh... Time to stick with it. The best part? #F2P #FPS #Multiplayer
22556,"Excellent Net Code. Still buggy but it has a lot of potential. Don't War Thunder this you glorious Bastards, keep up the good work."
22557,"Ok Im not gonna go hard on this game since it is free to play,but its not that good.The game requires no skill which dosent make it fun,recoil isnt even a thing in the game.Now thats just two things.To use grenades you have to buy them in the store witch is kinda dumb but I can deal with it,but the thing is that you can only buy them for a certain amount of days.I dont know who or why someone thought that would be a good idea.Ok so past that you cant even heal in the game as far as I know I looked through the store and saw nothing witch is wired cause in the tutorial it shows you how too.Another thing is that I didnt see the airstikes or other supports in multiplayer but I saw them In the tutorial.Its an ok game but needs work and if you dont have any money and are looking for a decent game to play,you should try it out."
22558,good game
22559,Even worse than counter strike. Purely arcade and nothing special compared to all the other f2p-egoshooters out there.
22560,Best game ever!!!
22561,"no
please 
its
so
bad!"
22562,FUCKKK this game. The spawn points are ass and there are no ranked matches. If you like to play against high level people during your very first game then enjoy!!!!
22563,"One of the best FPS games ever made so far. Just play it.

CoD, Battlefied and CS:GO player here.

"
22564,Boring. Just play CS GO like a normal human being.
22565,"What you will hear 90% of the game ""Tac reload! Tac reload! Tac reload! Tactical reload! Reloading!"". All the tac reloading aside it's a pretty good for a free to play."
22566,"No way to report in game, but as it being a f2p there are a ton of hackers. The following list is of hackers i have encountered in 16v16 matches. Please feel free to comment the names of other hackers.
1) getp0wned
2) P00nSlayer69
3) pedroelmexicano
4)PopAHoe
5) ShadowBroker
6) Sorkaz
7) uTorrent"
22567,"Pretty good. No sign of P2W at all, which is a relief. Graphics are easy on even my potato pc (i don't need to run lowest, i can now run LOW!!) with framerates that don't look like a powerpoint presentation. A problem is bullet sponging; a headshot with a sniper rifle does not kill. I've tried this with the bots on practice a large number of times to guarentee that. A .50 cal round to the head would certainly kill. I would heavily recommend raising the damage on all weapons. Another is hackers/cheaters. Maybe I'm just awful at some times but some kills I've had (through walls, literally aimlocked onto) were very questionable. Some anti-cheat measures would certainly be welcome in the game if not already implemented.

All in all, however, a relatively fun game, with graphics that look good but don't set my computer on fire, and entertaining gameplay, although with a few issues that could be ironed out."
22568,"This game is really fun, me and my friends enjoy playing it very much. BUT..... since the game is new and in early access there are a few bugs and things to add in. The only reason i dont recommend this game is bacause of all the hackers that have cheated there way to the top, every game that i have played so far has been full of hackers/cheaters."
22569,"Full of hackers, no report feature what so ever. Can't change the scopes on your guns. 4/10 game. Don't waste your time playing a even worse call of duty rip off."
22570,"currently full of hackers using aimbots and fly hax, hopefully someone gets on top of this problem, otherwise a nicely polished shooter."
22571,"For my first time playing its very nice, barely any lag, my FPS is just off the roof and its just amazing what they did. I do have one problem headshots, seems easy to get alot of headshots, feels like it there is no recoil at all so its easy to get kills most of the time. So do I recommend this game, YES ABSOULTLY. Easy to learn and a very good FPS F2P game."
22572,"recommended fps title not p2w, but needs a asia server for people living in asia pls"
22573,"It's not a bad game, but too many hackers. It's basically 8 out of 10 games has at least one obvious hacker. The in-game options do not allow you to report the hacker nor do they allow you to kick them. So since there's little to no oversight on the hacking problem the game is basically crap."
22574,fun and enjoyble!
22575,"The Good:
No Pay to Win at the moment, only items you can purchase are cosmetic
Responsive controls and gameplay (netcode)
Fun game modes
Interesting abilities
Queues are very short (lots of players)

The Bad:
Generic shooter, not a lot separating it from other games
Graphics are meh, not terrible, but looks about 5 years old already
No competative modes, so you'll never be matched with players of the same skill level
More pistols would be awesome
More game modes would be nice

The Worst:
Rampant hacking right now. About half the games you join will have someone with an aimbot or infinite ammo rocket launcher machine gun and there's no way of reporting them.  The silver lining is those games will only last about 5 minutes, so it's a good chance to pet your dog and watch a youtube video.

Overall:
Fun shooter, it's not going to blow you away, but I definitely enjoyed the time I spent. I'll be uninstalling it for now. Check the Steam Discussion board and if half the top posts aren't about reporting hackers it might be worth checking out. Otherwise install any other FTP shooter, you're not missing anything."
22576,"Overall, the game is fun. Im only giving it a negative review for my inability to report hackers."
22577,Great game really funny & amazing
22578,"Been playing this game for a bit, its super fun and really good. Only some things would be to add some more things like death cam, more guns and more gamemodes (zombies would be awesome!)!"
22579,Inb4 bikini clad waifu soldiers and fucking mystical dragon guns of all colors of the rainbow.
22580,The servers are very bad. Black Squad need best servers.
22581,"It might sound a little bit harsh, but I don't think I could reccomend this game even if it is free. 

The monetization is garbage, renting items with no way to buy them with in game points  is archaic and a bit insulting considering how roughly polished this game is. The animations are lackluster, matchmaking doesnt appear to have any sense of a players skill level and would rather just throw players haphazardly into a game which has resulted in many a game being obviously stacked to one side. 

Though the matchmaking is also to blame, the map pool can also be an issue. There are very few maps to begin with which makes the game a little bland after a few matches. And some maps give a distinct advantage to one side compared to the other. 

My number one complaint seems to be the server quality. When you join the game you are given an option to pick your region, which is great! However, I'm not too sure where this games version of 'North America' is because 100-150 ping should never be the norm. I don't have terrible internet, I pay alot for internet I can stream with and having a latency makes no sense unless there is no west coast NA servers and I'm being routed to US east or something equally far away. 

I will say that I dont know what the development was like for this game. 

I don't know the budget for it. I'm not sure how much support they have going into it. I am not a game developer, I am a gamer. This is an opinion from someone who sees potential in a free to play game that seems to have been flopped out on the table for a cash grab. This game walks the fine line between a decent FPS and just another Nexon shooter. Hopefully with improvements it will get better.

pls give servers."
22582,have yet to play a game without a hacker in it
22583,"With my little time playing, I've experienced everything I need to write a solid review.

It's good. It's not going to blow you away by any means, and it's not going to make you want to throw your computer out the window. It's in the sweet spot of good, and bad. It's what you'd expect from a F2P First Person Shooter. What you wouldn't expect is, a non-pay to win aspect to the game. Gaining ingame currency is not that diffcult, and will most likely bring players back who want to visit the shop more often.

You're not paying anything for it, so why not try it? It's the generic arcade style shooter. Running in gunning is pretty extensive in this game, and I recommend you hop in with some friends and have some fun. With that being said, don't take this game too seriously. You're probably going to die a lot (as I did) and raging would just make it not fun. Just run, and gun and have some fun.

Overall though, it's a pretty solid for what your paying... nothing."
22584,Great early access so far a very good experience cant wait for the full game.
22585,the female characters that appears on the trailer will be added in a future?
22586,negro squad
22587,ww
22588, Very simplistic and promising shooter. Gunplay needs tweaking but devs are very responsive to player feedback.
22589,Two many hackers do not go on battle match to many hackers I hate this fucking game
22590,Absolutely loving the game right now. My only problems so far is how how fast you get kicked for inactivity just for leaving the game to take a quick piss. That and also sprinting with a knife (Which isnt all that bad as the maps are perfectly sized for close quarters and ranged combat).
22591,no voice chat
22592,DO NOT DOWNLOAD FULL OF HACKERS AT LEAST 1 PER GAME.
22593,the pretty good versoin of CoD
22594,"No anticheat
Client side Hit-detection(?)
Always get thrown into almost lost matches (5v5 destruction)"
22595,"Played for a few hours no problem, fun game. Then today I get into two games straight with dudes shooting through walls and everybody screaming hacker. Ruins the game.... They need to add a way to report people or vote to kick at least.... I'm done with this game until that happens."
22596,"Like litterally everyone on the planet has said, take CoD and CS:GO combined and this failed abortion is basically that. Everything bad about a low-skill twitch shooter makes it's way into this mess and every horrific design mistake that plauged CS:GO is also prevalent. Basically the only things you need to play this fine piece of software is a mouse (LMB only, ADS serves litterally no purpose), a keyboard with all the keys ripped off except for A and D, and a credit card to buy the good guns.

Pros:
+It's so bad it's funny.
+No VOIP so the cancer is contained to text chat.
+Pretty decent graphics.
+Pretty decent audio.
+So easy even a 4 year old can play it (judging by the community only 4 year olds play it).

Cons:
-Litterally everything else.
-Gives an antonym for ""fun"".
-Learn Portuguese over time just by reading chat.
-Rewards cheap gameplay and shuns actually using your brain.
-Uses Battleye so you know you're getting the absolute best anti-cheat service.
-Just overall garbage gameplay that isn't intuitive or fun in any way.

22597,Awesome game! Worked the first time I installed it great graphics to be Free to play!
22598,AVA 2.0
22599,"Made A review on youtube, calling this the best free steam game of 2017,  Still holds true .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jKWDKNwsbg&feature=youtu.be
edit 2018: Still the best free game"
22600,Full of unskilled hackers who can't play the game right. Also cannot easily report them either. Good game but ruined by hackers!
22601,What the hell you guy need ban hackers.... game is dead after release. GAME IS DEAD NOWWWWW TOO MANY HACKERS
22602,It's good when you're not getting spammed with grenades or sniped out of your spawn.
22603,no this sum queer ass game they be taking 10-15 bulets to die
22604,bad game dontmplay if yuou have some skill
22605,good game
22606,"this game has potential, yet sadly right now it is ruined by a shit load of hackers and theres no way to report any of them. you can only block them, but that doesn't serve any justice."
22607,"Yeah pretty good game, pretty nice when you can get no1 on scoreboard when playing for the first time.
Has nothing to do with playerbase ;j"
22608,"PROS:
1. it's free2play!
2. the sound and animation design is pretty good

CONS:
1. the graphics are ok, could've been better
2. very un-unique, follows the same old formula for a shooter game
3. controls are a bit weird

conclusion: If you're looking for a free2play shooter game to lose a couple summer hours too, than this game is perfect! However, if you're looking for a game to play very frequently, then this isn't the game for you, it gets repetitive after awhile.

PICKLES"
22609,it is not a bad game BUT hacker are starting to over run it just like most f2p shooters and if they do not fix it now they never will
22610,"hacks are released cant play a normal game, no point to play this game but will come back a week or later so for those for pay for cheat weekly good job."
22611,"Very addictive gameplay, no hackers yet this game looks promising so far but ping is the number one problem for Asian players. We need an Asian Server and/or SEA Server."
22612,Pretty nice game . It's free that's great . It's like call of duty .
22613,"Terrible. no anti cheat, no region locking, servers are terrible this game just seems like a scam to get you to open the skin crates. my advice dont play this just yet wait until all the obvious problems are rectified. uninstalled"
22614,Bardzo Fajna gra dajcie tylko granaty na perma i git
22615,"If you want a game filled with:


200 ping players.
Cheaters.
Airstrikes.
Artillery.
Helicopters.
Spastic jumping.
Snipers.

Boring maps.
No teamwork.
No tactics.
Repetitive gameplay.


Then this is the game for you!




"
22616,like the whole game but the problem is so many hackers recent hacker ive met is randyisnutty and vynn. they are even joking about how they hack they dont even try to hide the way they hack in the game :(
22617,Decent game.
22618,"I like the way Black Squad is set up. The user starts with a solid $250,000 which is enough to purchase a sniper or a couple regular guns (ex. SMGs, assault rifles).

And then even if you blow dat cash on sum poop a$$ weapon, you can make it back real quick like sawnic speed.

The balance in this game is pretty decent; I enjoy using every gun class. Nades have their quirks, but it makes for sum dank memes.

Ogre all this is spicy meme with gud memes."
22619,For a free early access FPS game its decent and good for me.
22620,"Pretty Graphics, smooth gameplay, a nice game for Free2Play!"
22621,"╔┓┏╦━━╦┓╔┓╔━━╗

22622,"I dont ever feel in this like ""Oh, i got killed because their gun is good"" or ""They donated so i died to their superior weapons"" not at  all. The controls feel tight, Recoil is a bit dampened but thats fine, very fast paced, quick respawn, for a free game, it is truly free and i utterly recommend it in its current state.

Performance

Seems to run fine ( GIGABYTE GTX 1050 Ti 4gb ) which with my computer I would expect ""oi fuckingz cunsole peezxents dunt have sheit un mah PeeScee"" Probably staying at around 75+ FPS. not CPU heavy at all (AMD 8320E 8-Core). So overall on performance, no issues.
???/10 performance (dont have any other PC's to test)

Graphics

Colors are a bit bland, but there is a color filter setting, slap on the ""Elegant"" Or ""Vibrant"" setting and its actually quite pretty. Textures look up to par for a Fall 2017 game, (especially in this stage). Effects are fine, cant see any good points or negatives in them except for the blood effects, kind of hollywood cheap movie style, as in ketchup red and far too much comes out. Still kinda imusing. Ragdoll effects are what you would expect. Graphically is alright. 
6.5/10 Graphics

Gameplay
Very light gunfire, dosent really feel heavy or weighted, about of the level of COD/BF4. Snipers feel a bit dinky though. Weapon speed effect is in, so pull out your knife. Has some attachments you can add, all guns can have suppressors put on, some can have laser sights, some come with Grenade Launchers. You can turn on/put on the suppressors and lazers, but not any sights or grips, those come with the guns. Headshots are very important in this game, and can change the output of a firefight. Recoil isnt something you can control like CSGO, so dont worry about it, the starter AR is very tight anyways. Lazers dont seem to change much, maybe better first shot accuracy. Suppressors simply take away all minimap output from your player but decrease damage a bit. Oh also, shotguns are kinda useless.
6/10 Gameplay

TL;DR Fast paced action like COD, fast spawns, but importance of accuraccy like CSGO. 7/10"
22623,this game is just on early access so it will be crap at first and with hackers but its only in beta
22624,"A good combination of CS:GO and A.V.A in an easier, player friendly kind of way. 

Definitely a good Free2Play game without Pay2Win factor. Ofc you can buy weapon skins for real money and some of the ingame weapons need some playtime to unlock, but all in all you can have the same exact base weapon inventory by playing without paying money. 
Maybe this will change with further updates or there are going to be added additional skins, to make the developers earn money, but for now its totally balanced for any player.

Very nice FPS in terms of Free2Play Shooters!"
22625,"I thought i would really like this game.. and i really did... you see i put ""did"". Thats because i reallized that there are so many hackers in this darn game.... every demo game i join there would be a hacker with a auto gernade launcher with unlimited ammo, or a auto rpg with unlimited ammo. It really sucks when you cant even come close to win a game when someone is cheating like that. would like if there was a banning system or a anti cheat program involved. Would make the game a lot better in so many ways. Besides that every other gamemode is perfectly fine and i think this game is amazing besides the fact of hackers. would strongly recomend..."
22626,"Opens Game

Plays 5v5 Domination ( Search & Destory ) on NA server

---

Loads into match, plays against 5 Taiwanese pros with 300 ping and know prenades and strats on the most random maps.

Fun game if you dont get 300 ping beasts on the other team, game rewards high ping and they eat bullets like sponges, fun game besides that point. Fix the servers or it'll get deleted real quick though.

"
22627,Great game to bad about the hackers.  Can't get  a decent game just give this game a miss until they fix the hacker problem.
22628,looks gay
22629,"Good gameplay.  Really fun.  

Matchmaking doesn't take into account the skill of players.  Matches really uneven.  Hackers running amok.

Once they get matchmaking and the hackers fixed up this will be the best f2p alternative to cs:go."
22630,when you get 7 bans in csgo
22631,"Bullshit ass game gave me 3 SAME black tide gernades bullshit..... ""RANDOM"" fuck this shit dude...."
22632,"blacksquad >>>>>csgo

日本が運営しているブラスクと異なり、すべての武器は無課金で購入することができ、課金はキャラクターなどのスキンのみなので競技性が向上しています！
アジアサーバーが来ると公式で発表されたので、今のうちにNAサーバーで装備を整えたほうが良いです"
22633,Single Handedly making the chat cancer.
22634,Overall its a good game especially when its not pay to win and no hackers. I hope this game would become more popular its actually pretty good its like a mix of Call of Duty and Counter-Strike. Developers please consider adding a Asian servers please <3 thanks. Hope your game would raise in popularity peace.
22635,"This is a lot like Crossfire except without the p2w. Gotta say, it's really entertaining."
22636,this is a good game but they need to fix the hacker fast 10game and i run into 6 games worth of hacking and there is nothing that we can do so dont downlode tell they fix the game and ik that it has been out for like 2 weeks
22637,"It is your Generic First Person Shooter. You got your Assault, SMG, Sniper and the Overpowered KSG(shotgun). 
Team Deathmatch is a small map where everyone is gunnning everyone down as soon as you spawn. Demolition are fun with somewhat larger maps. Assassin is just kinda boring for me, but I think the last game mode, Battle is the most unique of the bunch.
 I enjoyed the game mode for a while until this weekend where it was infested with cheaters with Auto Missile Launchers with infinite ammo where they end the game in 15 sec. It kinda puts you off. I enjoyed the gameplay, so I will rate it as a 8/10, but playability I would degrade it to a 5/10 because it has cheaters and such."
22638,"hiya this is user darklik9688 i would like to recommend something please make this xbox 360 and ps3 controller compatible also curious is this going to be a full game or just a beta
"
22639,Simple good game and its not p2w
22640,"this game is stupid. for the hip fire mode the 1st bullet is always accurate. and also u can run-n-gun too. even with lmg. its like theres no different using hip fire and aim down sight. i think it make the game broken, well it juz my opinion tho."
22641,"It's like a CSGO & CoD wannabe in one. Poor game mechanics and a ugly, clustry menu. Not satisfied."
22642,already full of cheaters
22643,this game is playing Call of Duty spaan traps with cs go spawn protection and the hitbox of of an old ps2 game.
22644,"No pay 2 win as of yet. Graphics are mediocre but friendly for lower spec PC's. What matters is gameplay and it's actually pretty good. It is the snappiest shooter I have played, surprisingly. This is all about aiming for the head and reacting the fastest, just like CSGO/CSS, but with elements of Call of Duty into it. It's not a bad thing at all. Assassination is a really broken game mode with the VIP running TO the attacking team. Demolition(S&D) is fun, just like other modes. TDM is just like other games.

My biggest problem with this game is the community. As with every free game, you will get people of all ages and skill levels, and you will get called a hacker for hitting absurd shots or having faster reactions than them and it's incredibly immature. Apart from that, the tutorials show nothing about educating people different game modes so we have people rushing with horrible aim in demolition, literally giving the opposing team free kills.

TL;DR worth a download. Try it out. Your results may vary with the community."
22645,good free to play game
22646,"Making it a quick review

Pros:
- number of arsenals to use
- easier weapon selection
- guns have low damage making it more challenging to kill an opponent

Cons:
- regardless how low damage the guns are, the head shot accuracy will topple it off iff you can aim good
- laggy servers; well it is F2P

In short, play at your own risk."
22647,gud geim vyri gu f
22648,All this game needs is competitive/ ranked matches and it would be perfect.
22649,If you like S&D old cod style or you bored with cs go bs come here :)
22650,"One thing about this game: Cheap sniper skins that don't look good otherwise can unlock good snipers for you.

No need to buy cases if you know what gun and skin you need; you'll get anything and everyting on community market"
22651,"This is just like every other free to play Korean shooter that's vaugely trying to be Counter Strike you've played. It brings nothing new to the table.
During early access you get every primary weapon for 15 days. Yep, good ol weapon timers. I'm sure once full release comes around just about everything decent will be behind a paywall. 

But hey, prove me wrong and make a decent game, I dare you."
22652,its a fun game so far if it gose PTW them ill never play it ... maps are to small and spawn camping is big
22653,Very good FPS
22654,"Quick, interesting and decent configuration. The maps and modes provide an immersive sense of gameplay. The player has to be alert at all times to survive. Based on the modes i've played each mode has a different setting eg. Deathmatch, Bombing scenario, Destroy Opponent's Packages, an stuff like that. I'm still learning the game being a CS GO player this game has got me hooked. Its as additive as any other Onine Multiplayer game like CS GO or COD. Based on its neatness, it still has quite the way to go, but hey it s Free to play game with a lot of new features.
If you're looking for a new game to play and is easy to learn I would suggest this one."
22655,"played battle match today. game took 1 minute, cause of cheaters. game lost."
22656,"Fun and easy to start playing if you have minimal experience with fps.
Maps are a little too straighforward, usually right, left or center, not option to go further sideways or up/down.
Still, the gameplay is nice and smooth, guns are cool too.
Can sometimes be a little rush heavy.
Seems to be in the running for the 2nd best F2P FPS choice."
22657,"Pls add an asian server, it is so lag when i play it in the diffirent region"
22658,Amazing game with huuuuuuuuuuuuge potential *-*
22659,"It's fun, it reminds me of the old school COD-ish games. The only thing sucks is no Asia server, the ping is so high. Hopefully there will be an Asia server in the future."
22660,I really really like this game but i find hard to play because i live in asia and there isn any server in there. hope u guys fix some bugs and add asia server. tks
22661,"Good game, like the style and feel, no running and stuff like that.
Sadly hackers make me quit the game."
22662,"Pretty legit.  I have to play on the lowest video settings because of ole bessy, but it still feels suitable to play.  Comes in above 40 fps, which surprises the hell out of me..  I will continue to grow with the community as long as servers are operational.

Additionally, some weapons feel really OP, maybe the guns in general, but it makes for a balanced approach in the end.

GG&FRAG!"
22663,This game is great but my one request to the creators of this game is to add the abillity to lean and aim like in Rainbow Six. If they add this feature then this is the best F2P FPS game ever.
22664,"It's basically a good game... until full of hackers... Speed hack, aimboter and few players even do bazooka spamming ( no cool down ). If developers dont ban them then it will be dead game. I regretted to become a founder, wasted 27 euro :/ 8/10 ( if no hackers) 1/10 with hackers"
22665,"This might become the new counter strike. At first I was sceptic because it was free, but now I can say it may be a better counter strike."
22666,"It's the archetype of those generic FPS games. Very boring. I've played this kind of crap since the 90s. Nothing new. Every one of these games look the same, sound the same, same voice acting, same pompous hollywood classical crap symphony music. Hyperactive teens pumped full of energy drinks that have snake-like reflexes."
22667,good game
22668,Best game I ever played!
22669,gg
22670,kinda fun but not really the thing u want to spent ur time on
22671,personally has what it takes to be best F2p Eports shooter out since 2010 also needs to get OCE servers! as a large player base is looking for a f2p shooter
22672,"還不錯 希望有亞洲服
Hope Asia server pls"
22673,The gun play is great. i like how the guns shoot. some of them are a bit too straight on recoil but its fine. the guns seem balanced for the most part. The only thing i have to complain about is the maps. I dislike the map design but i think its more or less personal preference. great free to play game. the Pay to win system is managable considering you get some of the guns every day if you log on.
22674,word is hackers allready ruind the game.......
22675,"Great gameplay, however EVERY match has a hacker."
22676,"Costco Call of Duty but worse
"
22677,Did someone crap out some code and call it black squad?
22678,"Its a decent game, its not doing anything super unique.

I could say the best thing about this game is the fact that you can buy guns relatively easy and they are permanent.

A lot of these shooters only make guns timed unless you pay real money.

But this game you can buy the guns with in game money (which is earned really easy. They have tons of events that just give you gold for logging on)


Tl;dr decent game that isn't P2W because guns can be bought with in game currency that is easy to obtain."
22679,"Saw this on youtube so i checked it out. well i was rather suprised that its a good game, however at this point its all ready over run in some modes with hackers :( would i recomend this game as it stands NO .. if the hackers were delt with fast and with no 2nd chances yes i would recomend this game and id even spend money on it"
22680,"lots of hacker, fix that pls
i love this game though, but hacker spoil
7/10"
22681,"I think this game is pretty good. I like to think of this game as having similarities to CoD. I don't expect much from free to play FPS's, if anything I rather dislike FPS as a genre these days. But when i played this game, and i was pleasantly surprised! If you don't mind like some of the older boots on the ground CoDs with a little CSGO mix, this game may be for you."
22682,tac reload/10
22683,too many hackers
22684,"A fun and addictive free to play FPS game, fancy guns and such. Maps are on the smaller side, but is great for an adrenaline filled, fast paced game. 





needs female characters."
22685,"Mouse sensitivity is like trying to use a cheese grater with hard shit stuck in it and the controls in general are shit.




If you want a free CoD experience, consider dealing with 300+ ping in chinese."
22686,"Great game, has a CSGO feel to it. But right now No bad game. Way to many Hackers!"
22687,RE-make of warface. Total Fail. Game play is horrible for fps. Lack of control.
22688,"It a trash game just combine CS:GO and COD and u trun out with this game DONT DOWNLOAD
"
22689,Played a few matches since the update seems to be less cheaters so like I said I would change my review.
22690,"Fun Game, Mixes all of thew right parts together."
22691,"Like the game so far, The sound effects are kinda loud even with it turned down but thats mostly the only bad things about this game, hope to see more maps because it seems like i have been playing the same three maps all day."
22692,Awesome Game!!!!!!!!!!!!
22693,"ONe of the best Free to play fps aside from dirty bomb 
Its balanced too so no pay to win issues"
22694,"Extremely bad. Weak CoD clone. Can't even adjust mouse sensitivity during the opening moments. Garbage. 

"
22695,"its amazing and addictive, my favorite game."
22696,"Basically cs:go, only it's not cs:go. Even emulates the recoil patterns from cs:go, which is kind of impressive...only it's very, very basic... Which is fine and well if that's what you're into, but my personal take on it - Just go play CS:GO."
22697,Its pretty neato
22698,Every play call of duty? well my friend this aint it...
22699,Rip Off of Csgo. U can scope in with all guns tho
22700,"this Game  is Good but Free For hackers 
"
22701,"This is the most generic military FPS I've ever seen. It feels like someone who's never played a video game saw some gameplay of CS:GO and COD and then tried to replicate it. Nothing interesting is done with the gunplay, which is only fun until you realize what you're playing. The game could honestly pass as a satire of the FPS market for how generic it is."
22702,Like CS:Go without the spray patterns and more micro transactions.
22703,"What a great game.  From the first few minutes in, I was having a blast.  And then it turned from ""Black Squad"" to ""Hack Squad.""  The cheating is here is obnoxious, and no I am not talking about skilled players doing what they do.  I am talking about situations like full auto rpg's which seem to be the rage right now and the ridiculous aimbotting.  

Hard to love a great game when it is infested with cheating lowlifes.  Until this studio implements a better detection protocol, steer clear from this title. 

"
22704,Game has potential but its basic bones. If you want to win then grab the mp7 and RUN AND GUN!(my favorite way to win) Riddled with hackers at the moment. No way to report them so for now thumbs down.
22705,I mean its decent but too many script kiddies
22706,"A great game, plus with free weapons you can try tons of diffrent styles of play! Would recommend!"
22707,Very fun
22708,"GLORIOUS! (Just needs a re-name,and maps are a tad too small.)"
22709,"Not bad for a free game. Basically COD meets Counter Strike. Def dont have a whole lot of replayability for me due to lack of customization (without paying microtransactions). I say this is for the fps gamer on a serious budget and wants a fun shooter, other than that, just play counter strike. I will give it a thumbs up for being fun."
22710,"Good game, lots of potential. More maps and more customization is what I'd like to see."
22711,This Game Would Be Bombastic If It Had Controller Support Other Than That 7/10
22712,"The game looks promising so far. Smooth gameplay, weapons are pretty well balanced, there are several different gamemods to choose from, and the servers seem to be solid, no latency issues at the moment.
No traces of the pay-to-win model yet, so lets hope it stays that way.
The game is currently a bit buggy (It randomly crashes when i start it, or sometimes it freezes when the match ends), but its within acceptable parameters for an early access game.

Overall, i recommend you guys give it a try. Its pretty fun and it has the potential to become a really good game."
22713,"Dont download.
Horrible hacker problem, that makes the game unplayable. Dev's refuse to intervene."
22714,"Decent game
Lots of hackers/modders/cheaters though. Blatantly obvious wall hacks and aim bots, as well as fully automatic rocket launchers and infinite grenades. 
Wouldn't play anymore until they get some form of anti-cheat, because as it is, it's really hard to enjoy."
22715,"This game is extremely good. Battle Match is some of the most fun ive had in any shooter. Here is the problem; every day there are more hackers. People who get instant headshots only and have infinite ammo(which means that they have that in thier grenade laucher/rocket launcher as well) and they make the game unplayable. Devs.. please... add a reporting system. These people would get SOOO many reports on them within minutes since it is so blatant. Your game is being destroyed by a hacker scourge, and they have no fear because they have no reason to. I do recommend this game, I adore it, I want to play shit loads more of it, but there NEEEDS to be a reporting system and some people on your team dedicated to those reports. I like this game so much I would do it in a heartbeat."
22716,"what a fucking waste of time.
Sucks balls.
No recoil.
no spread.
just rush and spray and pray."
22717,"Looks good, doesn't work. Full of cheaters, every game I play there are at least two or three on each side. There is not point for me to do anything in a mtach like that."
22718,great game i love it best free game since tf2 i would give it 10 out of 10
22719,"There are so many hackers. Today every game I've played has had the same person firing unlimited rockets, mkaing my team lose every time. What a bad F2P game. I can't believe I'm actually calling  a F2P bad but this is just BAD.

Edit: 5 games in a row and every game has had a hacker."
22720,it should be so the party is makeable before choosing the gamemode other that that the game is really fine
22721,this game is more fun than i expected with so many free to play games with crappy buisness standerds and pay to play aspects this game was suprising and fun
22722,"It's not bad for a F2P Game. Game runs pretty decent and it's a pretty interesting mix of CS:Go and COD. May come back to this one in the future.
"
22723,"verry lagy but i will give a thumbs up
"
22724,"Like Black ops and csgo. fun for a free game
"
22725,"They say first impressions matter. Well, they certaintly do for this game. My first six matches were invested with obvious hackers. For a game to be in early access to be already seemingly overrun with cheaters is not a good portent of things to come. While the game is free-to-play, there are games out there that do everything this game does, but better. Look elsewhere."
22726,Very badly optimised
22727,"TAC RELOAD! This game is great. Similar to Counter strike but obviously free. The sound effects of shooting an enemy is... addicting! Sniping in this game is also very fun, if you've played counter strike before you will find yourself right at home with this game. Also, they give a certain amount of money to purchase weapons. You dont buy weapons each round but you buy weapons that you keep permenently and you can customize your loadouts. I recommend this game!"
22728,Too many hackers
22729,This is a good game..servers are great..no lag..fun too
22730,Bad
22731,i love the shooter idea but it would be alot better with single player missons and better key lay out
22732,"The 'Demolition' mode feels so good with this game! The TDM mode is always a kill fest (great to kill time - and have fun if you like to go out and rampage  - but it's not my thing.)

My Rating:
8.2/10 (better than CS)"
22733,its a good game even in early game access  has lots of potential
22734,"Very casual game yes, run & gun, is nais."
22735,"Saw ""permanent"" on my beginner items. Not gonna pour time to get awesome gear that I don't even get to keep"
22736,advanced call of duty aids
22737,"This game is a knockoff of Rainbow 6 and CoD. It also takes a lot of things from CS:GO. Now I'm not gonna complain about the way it ""feels"", but this game is absolutely garbage, even for a free FPS. You want a good free FPS? Get Team Fortress 2. This game is full of hackers and kids who spam down corners and in general it isn't fun. The only way to get top frags is to buy good weapons, rather than to just have skill. Thumbs down, bad game, don't reccomend it."
22738,good game not my thing but good one
22739,لعبه جميله افضل ب كثير من كونتر
22740,"The game is broken, I literally can't even start it properly. It goes into the launch menu, but as soon as I hit play it just closes and doesn't actually start the game."
22741,"-nice replacement for CSGO 
-you can win skins and weapons through ranked games
-new weapons with every season"
22742,"maybe one of the best games i have played. maybe the new cod.

another wonder from valve. 30-60 fps on potato pc."
22743,this game had potential. I really enjoyed it. They do not care about hackers and that ruins the game. I was streaming this live and back to back games hackers were using rapid fire rockets on the enemy objects to destroy and the game was over in minutes. Made it a waste of time for legite players and all of us closed the game at that point. No use playing a game with that obvious of hackers that do not get banned.
22744,"It's a fun game, but...

1. Maps are too easy to spawn trap
2. Nothing stopping you from being in their spawn
3. Small maps
4. Will end up being pay 2 win

I realize some of these will likely get better in the full release, but it is hard to put much time into the current game."
22745,"Updated Review: 

As I mentioned in my previous review the Developers do listen, and they did just that. They frequently ban cheaters & hackers and the game is perfect for those that like fast paced CQC. 








==========================PREVIOUS REVIEW===========================
Until they resolve the hacking issues I cannot recommend this game. It is blantant enough that you see a guy shooting 1000 rockets and ending a match in 3-4 minutes or a hacker going 50-0 with all headshots in one match. 

 Like most FPS F2P games there is hacking, so how they address it will make all the difference in the world. 

As it stands now it is really bad. 
- No report system
- No bans .... yet....I've checked the stats of the hackers I have blocked, but their stats just keep going up and up. 
- Developers haven't released any announcements, information, or news that they are looking into it. 

The game itself is quite fun and has a lot of promise. It's too bad that once again the select few ruin it for the majority. 

For now I recommend waiting, and  if the hacking goes unaddressed it will be DOA the moment it leaves early access.



There is one major plus and that's the developers listen to the community, so I am optimistic."
22746,Game is fun. Too bad the anti cheat sucks ass.  No way to kick a players. Only way to report is through going to their website and filling out a form.
22747,"Yeah, this is a pretty good game. Definitely pick it up since its free. No reason not to try it out. You have to go through a short 3 minute tutorial, but get past that and you will have fun. Definitely should be in your rotation with CS:GO"
22748,Really good for a free to play
22749,"Very cool game! Yourself can train and to create! I recommend someone like call of duty, BLACK OPS or CS:GO!"
22750,"This game is pretty easy to learn if you have played the game, Counterstrike, in which, I never have played. Either because I was too young at the time or I just never straight up heard of it and didn't have interest at all in it. I will have to say that the game as you dive into it is intense, that's just from only playing team deathmatch. The maps are a bit small, in my opinion, but they are well made. 

Before you say anything about how would I know if it was like Counterstrike, I have played the Minecraft version of it.

My aim is a bit shotty but it gets the job done as I play along as the game goes on. The one thing I noticed is that you can easily spawn kill people although there is some spawn protection but it may be too notice-able. I also noticed how few servers you have for the overseas players, that should also be changed as the game is getting more players over time. To me, a good server infrastructure makes a good game. 

And this, is a good and will be an addicting game."
22751,not bad at all
22752,"No point playing, full of cheaters, Steams anticheat is useless, Battleye is too.
"
22753,"GAME IS FUN AND ALL, BUT THE CHEATERS AND HACKERS FUCK UP THE GAME.



NO KICK SYSTEM. NO ANTI CHEAT. NO VAC. DONT PLAY UNLESS THE HACK IS GONE



"
22754,"Its not a bad game, its just that this game needs some better shooting mechanics and graphic updates. If yall fix that it would be better."
22755,"Did you like Call of Duty 4 or MW2 multiplayer? The gunplay reminds me of those games. So give it a try.

This is my biggest complaint. THE MAPS ARE TO SMALL!!!! 

I really love the game but the maps are TO SMALL!"
22756,"good game, its free including some dlc which is also free, it works well on my terrible computer and you can see that the creators of this game are trying however there are some issues like attachments which you cannot remove (exept for scilencer on some guns) and the voice actors are not good. overall i give this game a 7/10 jars of kompot and a squating gopnik"
22757,Very fun and free fps game.
22758,"The graphics arent bad, but aren't the best I've seen. They did a good job with the physics and the gameplay. However, you guys NEED to nerf some of the weapons because there are some powerful weapons, like the first starting weapon has been seen played by high level players and they do crazy good. Then I use it then I start getting up in the ranks. I suggest maybe adding an option to sell weapons. I bought the very last sniper and figured I could quickscope like I do on Call of Duty or GTA V but its a completely different style so I kinda want to go AR now. But it kinda was my decision so... Anyways, I reccomend it but I suggest fixing the bug where weapons float in the air when somebody dies. Lastly, PLEASE get a better anti-cheat or anti-hack program because I've seen hackers doing some of their magic and it's not fair at all.

With home of improvement,
-GeneralJay"
22759,If you dont know if you want to play CS:GO or COD
22760,"So, it was an interesting FOS that tried to merge some parts of a class based loadout system from games like the Battlefield and CoD lines. The game has simple objective game modes (TDM, Search and Destroy, Protect/Assassinate the VIP) that do not have any kill streak (or rather, point streak) perks. The one ground war-esque game mode has two teams vying to destroy 5 objectives owned by the opposing team. This is the only one with the point-streak perks active. Weapon loadouts are separate from the different perk paths you can choose in the ground war game mode. Weapon handling is okay, really varies based on weapon. Some weapons feel like laser guns without recoil where as others feel like you're lugging a giant stick around.  All in all, I would've said this game was acceptable for a free FPS... until recently. Hackers showed up, infinite rocket launchers ruining the ground war maps. The other game modes are done better in other games, so I played those far less. 

Pros: 
Decent weapon variety with wildly different handling on each gun.
No noticable rubber-banding while I was playing (decent servers).
Perk variety is fairly wide accross the 4 current classes. (Although they currently do not have any additional perks from the base set)
Fairly easy to earn in game currency between matches, daily log in, and initial welcome pack.
I found the VIP mode to be quite interesting as the killing team also needed to escape; a nice move towards balancing the game mode (disliked the VIP being AI).

Cons:
On the slippery slope of pay 2 win model. (Some things currently are locked behind pay wall)
Guns do not reliably feel like they handle well. They are missing something to make them each feel more... real.
No try mode for guns in the shop. You don't actually know what you're getting besides some numbers on the side.
The hackers have arrived. 
In many small ways, the game feels unpolished. It's the same thing that many other F2P FPS games suffer from.

Overall, it was a fun little time sink for a bit, but the amusement is fleeting and the hackers rapidly drained the remainder of the fun. No apparent report system (not that it matters in a F2P). If you want a game to play for a few hours to have fun, this is fine. If you want a game to commit to and play for a while, I'd say avoid this one.
"
22761,its pretty good
22762,"Not a bad game, just not my style of shooter!"
22763,GREAT!!
22764,Good game. However the devs should focus on getting a anticheat program if they want the legit players to stay.
22765,deal with the hackers like fuck other shootergames have people watching servers for hackers non stop when they frist come out why cant you guys put that on the front of the list its ruining the game that i was enjoying i cant recommend this game this that shit is fucking fixed
22766,"There should be easy system to report cheaters. :/

But the game look pretty good."
22767,"Black Squad is like a mix of COD, Insurgency, and CS:GO. It brings new things to the table with the Battlefield and Assasination gamemodes. It is very face paced and easy to progress and unlock weapons. Solid F2P game 9/10"
22768,It has a few minor bugs that can be ironed out over time but its a fantastic game and better yet it's free.
22769,Hackers.
22770,"Decent player base,
Free to play! No p2w,
Good maps,
Balanced guns.

All I want now is a competitive mode."
22771,"Better than I expected. It's pretty fun, but the teams are unbalanced right now."
22772,"Cookie cutter ue3 shooter.  Toggle to hold scope doesn't work, and out of the 3 maps I played they were all half acre of shit.  Uninstalled after that."
22773,The gunplay is very decent and fair
22774,"Full of cheaters in this game... headshots and one-hit kill 
In mission mode, unlimited RPG or something one man army destoryed all mission objectives


Update 1:
Played this game around 1 week, lots of hacker have cheats,  just like ghost recon future soliders(no one play it as hackers out of control like black squad), hackers with unmited RPG/Frag to finish the game and we are not playing this. 

In the game, hacking team or their customers said they are making  demo and advisements so kill all people and get 30000 scroll by one man army cheats ... And 1000+ cheaters there... (Great, this game provided the link for reporting cheaters one by one, no in game report...)

OK, you guys can experience cheating & scrolling but not playing the game.


Update 2:
I tried to report, but still have 50% chance to meet cheaters in game. Can you have fun by typing cheaters name (If yes, you can play your keyboard, no need to play game)? Is that a full time job for reporting? Salary? The game supose you use a life time to report cheaters?"
22775,Hackers LUL
22776,"Free First Person Shooter.

Free to play and when i say Free i mean Free.
No pay to win aspect.
Customization like skins.
Graphics are little out dated but i dont care.
Nice community.
Kinda big player base.
"
22777,"Its free, and for a free game it isn't bad gameplay wise. Really fast paced, instant action. The netcode is a bit dodgy though and has the same annoyance as CS where you can headshot across the entire map without aiming. The thing that annoyed me most though was that if you fire a rocket launcher or a grenade and then die as you fire, it will most likely cancel your shot/throw which is just stupid. 

 I started being tactical and using my scope, but got more kills just spraying and pre-firing corners.
Equally you can be killed by people pre-firing or lagging around corners too. Overall not that tactical, more luck based.  


However, it's fully pay2win/grind2win. The upper weapons and special weapons are MUCH better than the base items. Picked up some high ranked weapons and it was easy, the normal ones may as well not function. There is a 14 day trial on most weapons via the free DLC or by picking them up off the ground.

An OK number of maps for a free game, but most of them you can spawn camp too easily. 


I only have a few hours so can't confirm it, but it looks like really high level players unlock stuff quicker (or are cheating). One guy I was playing with got over 30k points (when everyone else had 2-3k) in 2 minutes and had all the point based unlocks (like turrets, rockets) almost immediately on my team with 1 (ONE) kill. I encountred one or two cheaters which isn't uncommon, but more than games like CSGO/TF2 etc

The tutorial was OK though and gave it more of a tactical feel. 


Overall, it's OK to kill a few hours on, and think a lot of a positive reviews give it too much leadway because it's free."
22778,"One of the best  games i have played.  Just download what the fuck are you waiting for 
"
22779,Just buy a bad company 2 or some cod from g2a thank me later
22780,"Its something you can play hours on end, it gives me alot of crossfire vibes, which is very similar to this game."
22781,Very good game.I wish to have more gamemode.But plz BAN THOSE HACKERS.They are so annoying!
22782,"Game is actually good being an F2P game. hoping this wont turn into a pay to win game and was hoping for a sea server. trying this game using wtfast at the moment! 

PS. Bryan listens to us players unlike other games! :)"
22783,"This is a good game, please give it a chance."
22784,"this game is nice and fun,but the amount of people hacking is annoying me . If you dont count the hackers then this game is not bad."
22785,"Maps are shit , takes no skill for this game , theres almost no recoil. Search and destroy maps are so small that an enemy can show up while ur on ur way to B.

Disadvantage for snipers , very few high ground.

6/10"
22786,Cheaters and laggers everywhere. Just had a one with unlimited grenades firing full-auto and another guy with aimbot getting headshots with a pistol through smoke across the map.  Done playing this game.  Get some cheat protection and some region locked servers or it will be the downfall of this game before it even leaves early access.
22787,"If you're looking for a bunch of badly inspired military graphics, rounds faster then what your mom can take in bed & a matchmaking even worse then Ubisoft - Then this is it! :D

Nothing beats a more poorly designed game, then one that is also just as fun watching as german p0rn0graphy.

A major chaos, and a great waste of time - Played at own risk ;)"
22788,Gameplay of csgo. Gun accuracy of Call of duty. And the graphics of battlefield. This is an amazing game for a free to play.
22789,Loving this game so far! Not perfect but it is a solid shooter and excited to see where it goes
22790,"Whilst looking for a quick FPS, the likes of Warmode or Battleground, this game came up ;) A quick look at the requirements stated that my laptop will have a problem. Starting the game went oke, finding a match worked as well. And damn still i need low settings but its quick. Even with the HUB visuals, kill cam and body pill ups. Black Squad gets my Thumps Up."
22791,"F2P and a lot of fun how can you go wrong ? ... 

It does have hackers as you would expect with any game that requires skill ;)"
22792,Dollar store call of duty
22793,"U guys did a great job but we are facing many hackers at this time. I hope you will fix this issue soon. Anyways, is there any hope for players in Asia, I mean the ping is high."
22794,"well done, EARLY ACCESS, hackers running all over the place, firing AT4 like LMG. well done. i can see this game future going down the roads of hell ;D"
22795,This game is very fun and even though the game needs some gun balancing it is the most fun ive had in a while
22796,wow this game is awesome y love it y think you can put a campaing in other maps or something like that and you can put a part named social that you can do friends and play with them y think it could be usefull ¿no?
22797,to ez bro
22798,"its just another trash f2p fps. so boring and the gun sounds sound bad.
2/10 highest i am giving it."
22799,"Very solid game, it's ,mix of CS and CoD 

Only thing missing is competitive mode,last kill cam ( not nececary), and most important weapon balance(recoils,dmg,etc.)"
22800,look so bad. To fast dead. and its pay to play good.
22801,"Seems like some garbage straight out of 2005.

-Shitty UI
-Bland shitty gameplay
-Everything seems pretty shitty

If that's your thing you will like this game."
22802,good game
22803,"Great game i would recomend . Looks like bf 4 graphicaly and gameplay is a mix between cod 4 and csgo 
"
22804,"Such a bad game, just get csgo."
22805,damn sonnn thats the game they do it
22806,Very funny game. I love it 10/10
22807,󠀡
22808,woah.....
22809,for many many many many many days i have played this game and uhhhh it is so amazing due to the fact uhhhh that it has guns.
22810,Best free fps out there
22811,"Wow where to start... Another FPS game that has loads of weapons for you to buy so they can make money. talk about unbalanced. so people with higher rank will of course have better weapons which means more damage. 

You can do demolition where you plant bomb, most competitive game mode ever. YET when you want to play that mode, you will 9/10 join a game thats already started.

Dont have a competitive mode and not be competitive. holy shit."
22812,"This game is absolutely the best fps shooter can you recieve for free!
Even better than CS:GO in 100 percent.
So:
Pros:Low-Medium sized graphics which is good for players who have a bad computer.
        A lot of weapons to choose from.
        Balance and very good hitbox.
Cons:You should run without a knife equipped.
         TDM maps are very small and there is not a lot maps.  So after a long time it being bored to play TDM
         Most of the weapons are from 15 day DLCs
         No skins.

Graphics:6/10
Gameplay:10/10
Tutorial:10/10
Sounds:10/10
Others:3/10
Overall: 7.9 points! I recommend it"
22813,"I like this game, but until they get off thier asses and do something about the hackers, i'm going to uninstall. It make no sense the amount of hacking that's going on. And it seem that the devs don't care at all. Fix this game."
22814,nice
22815,Bland
22816,Good remeber A.V.A
22817,"It's ok but not good, server is laggy and I blink around quite often like I am tracer from overwatch, gunfights are boring because guns have nearly no recoil, but aiming is quite frustrating due to the lag and the movement of the characters are very weird, sound effects are totally shit, maps are not well designed as most of them are quite small so if you can spawn camp in TDM you basically win the game, overall cannot recommend"
22818,Best game ever
22819,"The animations, sound quality, graphics, and gameplay are all a solid 10/10.

But the fact that anyone with a toast connection can join your match with 200+ ping and lag their way to victory brings this game down to a 3/10. Until I can play a match and not worry about someone killing me around the corner, I can't really recommend this game.

Update: The amount of hackers in game is reaching a ridiculous level. And without a vote kick or report function, it makes the game even worse."
22820,this is a great game! Although there are some things that could be improved. First off i think that you should be able to use a mic in game. it would make it more fun and more team based. i also think that it is kind of hard to get enough gold to buy weapons and i think that the costs should be reduced. i also think that the interface is kind of outdated and kind of hard to figure out. I feel that this game should also have some sort of ranking system. it is very fun but having a ranking system would push people to grind and try to be the bestl. this is one of my favorite games ive played and its free. overall its a great game! But like any game it has its flaws.
22821,"Игра очень хороша!Она непохожа на такие игры как CS и CoD, больше смахивают на игры Cross Fire,Point Blank и Battle Carnival.В этой игре другая система боя, если пришли с CS то вам будет сложно,но если вы играли в игры похожой тематики то вам эта игра будет доваться легко.Да и в этой игре на даный момент донат не решает, а решает твой скилл.Советю всем пойграть хоть она ещё в раннем доступе!"
22822,"cs go clone ran smooth, no frame drops or other issues like dc but a boring dumb cluster fuck like cs go or call of duty games."
22823,"gooooooooood
"
22824,"It's acutally a pretty good game for a free game, are graphics good,  and gore is good i would reccommed this if you are in a FPS type mood."
22825,Spawn Camping Simulator 2017 is the best game. Map design is so good... so good that the majority of the maps have one side just duplicated and mirrored on the opposite side. Give 10/10 on weapon balance. KSG is 10/10 best balanced gun 10/10!
22826,"fun game 
"
22827,"Maps are small, shooting mechanics are horrid, you spawn on top of each other, everyone jumps to dodge bullets, you have to purchase grenades.... Over all, a low budget shooter that was probably better on paper than what the final outcome is."
22828,one of the worst fps games ive ever played
22829,BEAUTY
22830,GG
22831,"i like the game but i hate when i playing i go back to lobby itself so fix the problem bitch
"
22832,"I deleted my previous positive review.

I'm setting this a negative review as this game is a simply worse version of what it has been. While the gun play and the maps are fine, the direction this game is headed is a gamble at best.

In their latest patch, they removed the ability to see how many times you died during a match. Most updates are only about adding new cosmetics to the store with little to no change to the gameplay.

"
22833,no
22834,"its alright, devs have to fix sniper recoil and the maps"
22835,Hackers already swarming the game.
22836,"
PROS:
Fun, Cool weapons, Not Pay To WIN,  I have not seen any hackers, community seems ok.

CONS:
To few maps"
22837,this game can be considered as good as csgo or r6
22838,"So far this is a very good and extremely fast paced free to play shooter. The different guns have different feels, but since it's so fast paced there isn't really any inbalance, just skill. Big problem though, no latency limit for ANY labbies. I'm on the NA server, living in Canada, and I'm getting about 60ms ping. I'm playing in games where most people have 100+ and a few (usually the ones doing the best because this game favours a worse connection) have 200-300. It's infuriating outplaying someone in every way but still dying because the game engine decided that they could see you first because of their horrible connection."
22839,Good Game #BestReviews
22840,"This is a great game but it really really........... need SEA sever, we love this type of game, relaxing, don't need tactic of teamwork, just shooting and having fun. Great game"
22841,Awesome...
22842,о
22843,"Although you might think its pay2win game it is not, its fast, fun, and easy to find a match and you don't have to pay money for better guns to own them for few days (warface) because all guns can be bought with in game money and even the weapon you start with is good when you got used to it, but the worst thing is the cheaters since there is no anti cheat system so good luck with noops. 7/10 overall worth a try"
22844,"rage inducing pile of festering garbage
-disgusting gameplay(it takes little effort to be good)
-constant spawncamping
-and much more."
22845,Snipers are OP. Shotguns are worthless. Maps are extremely small.
22846,"CS:GO wannabe.

It seems to me as a student's work, not bad as a first shooter game project, lol.

Playing this game you'll understand how good CS:GO actually is, he he.

I feel sad for people who play this game."
22847,Pretty good game
22848,ye
22849,Its like a better version of SF2 if you have ever played that
22850,This game is garbage. Every match has at least 3 hackers in it. Was fun to try but the fucking anti cheater shit needs to be updated.
22851,"Amazing game! 10/10. Really fun FPS, it's free and the servers (from the given regions) are very good!"
22852,GREAT GAME!! Pretty Fun!!
22853,"great fun, amazing community, i havent found a single unkind person, whether they are on your team or not, everyone is just looking to have a fun gaming expirence"
22854,I played this game for thirty minutes and I am in love.
22855,is prett gud
22856,Wow another good free to play game
22857,muito bom
22858,great game no p2w bull just git gud and enjoy mixture of cod bf and cs
22859,"Looks like a good game. Would be good to have more guns and maybe more maps BUT the biggest issue is matchmaking. Skill balance is off, way off. 
Overall GG. Hope the developers dont abandon it cause i can see lots of people liking it."
22860,"TL;DR: Genuine f2p shooter that doesn't nickle and dime you, solid gunplay


Black Squad is a unique to say the least. It's a free to play shooter that plays well, and hides nothing behind paywalls except for cosmetics. All guns, characters, and equipment are bought through the in-game currency, which is aquired fairly easily.

The game starts you with about 250,000 credits, which is a surprisngly large amount. It's enough to buy 2 guns outright. The guns are all equipped with a laser sight and silencer, which can be toggled freely. Some rifles also have a grenade launcher as well.

The only place the game really falls short on, is the maps. They're quite small, but they are well designed and play well. When it's all said and done, Black Squad is an excellent f2p FPS game, and could easily set the standard for what games of this genre should be. I'd give Black Squad an 8/10 overall."
22861,hacker everywhere.....  For west coast the ping is very high..
22862,this game is awesome and cant stop playing
22863,Just in the short amount of time I have played this game it has been amazing. Coming to this game from CSGO was a breeze  the only key that took me time to learn was the running. The knife mechanics are almost the same as CSGO. Sorry to compare to CSGO but that is one of the only pc games I play.
22864,"I actually really enjoy this game. That being said its nearly unplayable. The hackers in this game are awful, you are lucky if you go one game without them. Sometimes its a guy teleporting with a knife, sometimes its a wall hacker with aim bot doming you the milisecond your hitbox is seen, or maybe its the guy with a bolt action snniper rifle shooting grenades at the rate of an mp7. 

I sincerely hope the devs find a way to combat these hacks, great game, just no fun for the people playing fair and having a good time."
22865,"So far so good! Real, good fun."
22866,"This is a worse version of Warface. No sprinting, no sliding, ADS is worthless, its better to spray from the hip and not ADS. No tactical or strategic elements at all. Every gun is like a lasor and it's a battle of who can spray faster. Also there are not one, not two, but THREE premium currencies in the game. This is getting rediculous. Go play Warface, Combat Arms, Alliance of Valiant Arms, CSGO, or a miriade of other games far better."
22867,i put in password and it doesnt load i think its a scam or virus attack.
22868,"You might get some hackers on, but developers are working on it."
22869,"I am quite fond of F2P FPS games, and this one I can see myself playing for quite a long time. It's got loadouts, so if you've played Halo Reach or Halo 4, you'll know what I'm talking about."
22870,Amazing game should play
22871,its a pretty good game but it needs game chat. it feels a bit to quite. i might be retarded but i don't think there is game chat . and if you do add game chat maybe have the default key to c since it fits most peoples hand
22872,"Arcady shooter. Fun to just blow some steam running around killing dudes. Not pay to win. Most of the micro-transactions are for unique skins or to get more guns faster. Guns essentially have no recoil. Think of each gun as the P90 from CSGO, everyone is strafing and running and gunning. You can quick scope in this game!

Fun game though. Just nothing to be over serious about."
22873,"- Opens laptop
- Loads steam
- Sees Black Squad and seems impressed
- Reads review
- Downloads game
- Game finishes downloading 
- Loads game (Okay smooth so far)
- Play tutorial (Hm may need to put up mouse sensitivity) 
- Goes on menu (Nice game so far)
- Get's reward
- Woah I can buy this bad ass gun! 
- Buy's gun
- Play's quick match as Privite
- Woah this is so smooth and no lag!
- Woah I suck at FPS but this is actually fun
- *Game ends* Wow now I'm a Serg. Major!

This is an actual fun game. Much more fun than COD or CSGO. 10/10"
22874,This game is so good
22875,"Pretty solid shooter, can't complain much.
Gun sounds and graphics could still improve and personally, I'd love to see proper customization (attachments and character gear) later on."
22876,"So far of what I seen of this is a 2017 reskin of CS:GO. Granted the graphics look good, but beyond that, the authors of the game seem to aim to make bank by skins. Because that is what magically my focus was drawn to before I even started the game. Just like CS:GO, every microtransaction for these skins will land money in their pockets and they seem to want their goal of several hundred dollar skin transactions.

I saw someone say absolutely no cheaters. This is pure BS. My first match there was someone on my team facing a wall and getting kill after kill. It was then when I realized there was no anti-cheat software that loaded with this or seems to run along side it. Essentially this game is CS:GO for all the non-skilled losers that were VAC Banned from CS:GO.

As it's current state it has promise, but it also needs to have ways to report hackers and/or VAC or some other software to ensure proper punishment bans are happening. I know some of you will cry about VAC, but in the end it blackballs you on VAC games and add's a remark to your Steam Acct that you have had a ban previously. Out of most of the other games I play, none seem to be as harsh to the punishment like VAC, so I like it for that aspect."
22877,chave memo
22878,"Love love love this game. Great Free to play game. most free to play games have weapons that are only temporary or constantly need to be repaired. This game doesnt! all weapons are permanent, money is easy to acquire and no repairs needed"
22879,"this game is fun and addictive as hell, has a lot of potentials if the dev decided to keep updating it.
but as every new game it has some flaws that hopefully they get fixed, like :
-region lock  
-hackers 
-no voice chat
it would be great if they add an elo ranking system (like csgo)
but over all, it's a fun game to play."
22880,"this shit , is absolute gAdbage ,if u play u aint got a mother single brain cell in yo skull, u get put in box to shoot another mother fucker there is no tactical anything in this game unistall abort this shit like dean hall aborted dayz"
22881,A very fun game. If you like fast pace action games like call of duty you will like this game.
22882,this game is alot of fun quick-paced action u can ADS and no-scope people buy attachements with gold/medals/bullets and other currency the types of game play are alot of fun i like TD the best its just an all around good game to play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so have fun with it and go kick some ass.......
22883,"Super fun game, have been wanting a different fps to play and did NOT want to fork out 60 bucks for an old CoD. Great Game!"
22884,"Ok, so for starters, WHO THE FUCK MAKES A FPS IN 2017, WITHOUT THE SPRINTING ABILITY. THIS IS MADNESS. We're at war, walking towards like fokin dolls.

Now, the graphics on the other hand look freakin amazing. But the gameplay, is completely shit. It's messy, not precise, too much things on the screen I feel like I'm in a helicopter. And what the hell is that interface. Everything is mixed together in the inventory, and the sounds are awful.

BUT the graphics are really good !

"
22885,it`s a neet little fps. needs more custimization
22886,"So this is one of the best F2P shooters I have ever played. And when I say free to play, its actually completely FREE. Weapons and many of the main things can be purchased with in-game currency, and so far, there is no way to buy it with real money, so it's not pay to win. It runs extremely well with great visuals and a solid framerate. Animations are great, voice acting is ok, and gameplay is somewhat unique. Imagine Call of Duty mixed with CS:GO and a MOBA game. There are so far 5-6 gamemodes. One of which has skills you can use by building up points for every action you do. Demolition 5v5 has the style of CS:GO and tactics very much like Rainbow 6 Seige. Anyways, in conclusion, I highly recommend this game. It's definitely worth your time."
22887,very smooth game :)   I enjoyed it :D
22888,Better than CS:GO
22889,"How does this game have a mostly positive review score? Let me explain what this game is:

>90% of the soldier dialogue is ripped from Call of Duty and performed nearly identically by a bargain bucket version from the pound store of voice acting

>the kill sound is practically ear rape 

> I feel like alot of the shooting mechanics take inspiration from Counter Strike, however with all the skill removed and boiled down to holding left click when turning any corner for ez kills

>the only thing I'm happy about in regards to this game is the fact that it's free

>the tutorial is more exaggerated than a Micheal Bay film

>how people find this game remotely interesting is beyond me. Guess they must enjoy feeling like a god in a game where most players are sat on their parent's laptop fiddling with a trackpad 

>do yourself a favor and don't play this game thanks"
22890,"The graphics are passable. Nothing more.
Audio is passable. All the guns sounds the same. Somewhat satisfying kill-sounds.
Map-layout. Absolutely horrid. Most of the maps are way too small. Sight-lines are poorly layed out. Way too camper-friendly.
Game-mechanics issues. It makes no sense at all to have temporary invulnerability after you have left spawn-room and are actively engaging in combat. Especially since the maps are so small that you end up in these situations more often than not.

This feels like a very cheap COD-clone with some CSGO elements.

"
22891,"better then i expected, in fact. its alot of fun"
22892,TAC RELOAD
22893,"Awful... Game is rigid. Guns feel very much like an arcade game. No real accuracy change between aiming and hip fire. Feels like a CoD, Rainbow Six and CSGO knock off, but somehow in some dumb universe acctually made CoD look realistic. If that last comment did not make you think this game is bad, it is clear you a moron who buys every CoD game that comes out thinking it is a better shooter than Battlefield and Arma 3. If you want a good shooter/military sim buy Arma it is worth the cash, and is not a microtransactional shithole that this game will eventually become"
22894,"if you like csgo and cod, perfect game for you (easy)."
22895,good mix between CS:GO and COD. And although it's F2P it is not pay2win. hard to get into but much fun when you are good.
22896,"it's Free to play But it's not Pay to win

very good Graphic
No overpower weapons
Easy to get money in game
Cheap guns
Gun's recoil is easy to control

Black Squad is worth to play"
22897,"This game is totally awesome its not too hard to learn mechanics and its not a pay to win game but,dev's need to fix hitboxes really.."
22898,kys valofe
22899,"Nice game
Really fun
Bryan notice me senpai"
22900,"This game is an amazing free to play fps game.
It is very enjoyable and fun to play.
I have been playing this game for 2 days and there are no complains to be found in this game and the graphics are very smooth and almost any pc could play it atleast on medium - high graphics."
22901,"If u like call of duty but thought cod needed shittier movement, guns, gameplay, and maps this is the game for u"
22902,"hacking prevention uses battleeye. Hackers are getting through without issue. Until they can get a better hacking prevention, or put in a report via in game, I can't recommend this game.

Sad too cause the game is pretty enjoyable."
22903,"Looks promising! Perhaps I am just dumb, but once I finished the Tutorial, the only server I could have access to was one I started up. So, maybe not many people playing atm?

Edit: I am dumb. Game is good. Has aspects of the Call of Duty mixed with Rainbow 6 and CS:GO.
Not bad, face paced action. 7/10 would keep playing!"
22904,Not Bad Just Hard As Fuck To Get Into  [the tutorial was confusing AF for me]   and jumping in to my first game was......Lets say.....Special....
22905,Report system desperately need for this game... cheaters are gathering.. and match making is really unbalanced.. full clan with TS against random team who may have full beginner.. Good job... uninstalled.
22906,The game is great apart from the snipers are Over Powered. The dev's need to add sniper sway.
22907,"Really nice game, but need an Asian server. Keep up the good work on the game!"
22908,All the pluses from COD and CSGO. none of the minuses. Except the maps are a bit too small.
22909,Already has fucking disgusting hackers. Seriously? Uninstalled.
22910,"This game is absolutely bullshit. Every match has a hacker on each team using god mods, aim bots and wall hacks. The security in this is so terrible that it's impossible to play it without somebody killing you on every fucking encounter even if you've shot an entire magazine in there fucking head. This game is essentially pay2win as well because of a secondary currency that's in it that costs real money but can be used as a substitute for the primary currency and you don't have to spend as much of it as the other currency. Also microtransactions. This game is a shitty version of what happens when you mix CS:GO with Warface and remove PvE functions. Also just for the idiots who aren't paying attention I'll give you an example of a hacker fucking me over. Me and someone else were like ten feet away from each other side to side and somebody who comes in FRONT of use kills us both with one bullet."
22911,its a good F2P FPS atm... but kinda suck for SEA player ... only EU and NA server atm .... 250 ping but still kickass...
22912,"Pros:
+ Good balance between weapons. Makes my wheels tingle.
+ Decent hit registration. You rarely feel cheated out of a kill.
+ It's fun. When I play, I enjoy myself. It has a variety of gamemodes to suit your needs.
+ When they say absolutely no P2W, they MEAN no P2W. You can unlock any gun in the game withing several hours play, fewer if you try and go for the daily and weekly missions. You can acieve about 100 medals per day just through missions, and you get 100 every time you rank up (which is frequent). You get 500 medals every week with attendance bonuses, and 15,000 gold a day with bonuses alone, more through gameplay and missions. I cannot stress enough how nice that is.
+ Weapons; they just [i]feel[/i] nice. That's one thing they did very well. Lower power weapons feel almost nimble in your hands, while the higher powered assaut rifles feel like they shoot bricks. Whether you prefer damage or accuracy, there is a gun here for you.

Mixed Feelings:
+/- Mixed community; some toxic people, moreso in this type of game, but also quite a few people willing to be helpful and work as a team, which is refreshing. If you can deal with/ignore toxic people, you'll have no trouble here.
+/- Netcode is NOT amazing. While you may never feel cheated out of a kill, you may feel cheated in a death. I've encountered numerous times when I was in cover and/or couldn't even see the enemy and still get shot. It's most apparent when sniping on the Battle Match maps.

Cons:
- Hackers; every game has them, and this one is no exception. Out of 14 hours played at the time of writing this review, I've encountered 1-3 hackers total. It was very apparent. Some people are just really good at the game, though. There is an almost tangible skill gap. This is worse than a wobbly wheel.

K.A.R.T. Score: 8/10"
22913,"This game has potential but right now its shitty.
-Unbalanced teams
-Small maps
-Shitty netcode
-Shitty hitbox
-Not enough item/weapon"
22914,Another free 2 pay game  i played for an hour op weapons shitty main menu and hackers. I know it's early acces but for now i wouldn't play it.
22915,gooooooood game
22916,Nice game! I RECOMMEND!
22917,"Have enjoyed the gameplay so far, however cannot recommend this game until they introduce more servers. Playing from Australia is not enjoyable on US servers."
22918,It's something to do.
22919,Better then Overwatch
22920,"I wasn't expecting much from this game. When I did the tutorial, I wasn't impressed. However, when I got into the game I found that it was so much fun. I saw that the game was still in early access. I hope that the game continues to change and I look forward to playing as the game evolves!"
22921,decent for free
22922,"decent game. free makes it even better, but if i have to hear tac reload one more time ill kill myself. other than TAC RELOAD its good. (calling a reload tactical doesnt make it tactical, pls stop) ps. tac reload."
22923,"In this stage don't even bother with this game.
CONS:
- No PING LIMITER/ IP BLOCKdude's from other end of the world can play with you, which means you need to enjoy
+200ms ping players.
- Bad netcode, 3/4 of deaths are bcs of ""KILLED BEHIND COVER""
- Bad hit registration
- Bad hit detection
- Optimization, game looks bad but still like to choke on good PC's without reason
- BAD respawn system, specially in TDM.


PROS:
+ SO FAR! Looks and feels like true F2P weapons can be easly buyed via cash, which you earn
by playing the game.
SO FAR skins can be buyed by REAL CASH, but THIS CAN BE CHANGED
+Few game mods, few maps
+ No Hackers SO FAR
+ Game based on skill, but with BAD NETCODE/HIT REG it's just sometimes LOTTERY

"
22924,"i love this game way better than warface,

my only problem is theres a short amount of weapons,
and its hard to get them

but still i love this game keep up the good work"
22925,Can somebody give a reason why the communication and team chat is blocked for me in every single servers?
22926,"It  have become a  S H I T game now..Dont bother play it please save yourself

1.Unreg problem 
    E.g : ak47 shot to the head did not do any damage but r93 blazer shot to the body insta kill for 500 meter WTF???
2. Server issues
    E.g : server always kick me out of the game.I have a good internet connection FYI.
3.Lag issues.
   Just the whole game lag not just server but the screen lag is also F K I N ridiculous.
5.Hacker/Cheater.
   E.g : It just too obvious...Like really a player who can see me thru wall not smoke but WALL!!!!.

In conclusion, just save you time from  downloading this game.They are not gonna listen to the community or the player.New s tup id skin every update and skin prize is also F K I N expensive for a s h itty skin.JUST DONT DO IT AND SAVE YOUR SOUL."
22927,"Best Of Game n Graphics
"
22928,WE WANT ASIAN SERVER PLEASEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
22929,full of cheaters
22930,"I love the game so far. The hit reg works and guns feel smoothe, and it runs great. The one wish that would want granted soon is that they add a competetive game mode, I think it would add life to the game."
22931,"good game, now we have a server for Asia. Nice try guys !"
22932,the game's mechanic is bad. Shooting full auto feels like a fckin laser gun and theres hackers everywhere and the playerbase is godawful
22933,if u whant 1 shoot to head kill need pay 9.99$
22934,IT AWSOME! but hope it will add asia in to
22935,"No team balance, lost 5 times out of 6 in TDM while being 1st or 2nd everytime, with 1+KDR. The skill level of this game is so low you can do 1v3s with a TAR21 ( the base assault rifle which sucks )."
22936,"Very simplistic, yet highly addictive gameplay. Don't expect any realism, but as a casual run and gun game, this hits the spot. Weapons have laser-precision accuracy and very low recoils, snipers can be used literally midjump with no accuracy loss. This is the sort of gameplay you get here, some like it, others don't. I personally do. It's a nice change from playing something like Insurgency and then this to relax afterwards. Very casual, fast paced, fun. More akin to arena shooters like Team Fortress."
22937,This game is fucking good
22938,"This need to be controller supported, but other than issa great game."
22939,create brazil and sea servers tired of playing with third worlders
22940,This game is fucking horrible. I'd prefer playing cs1.6 instead of this game. Bad!!
22941,"Please put an Asian server
I am from the Philippines and everytime I play in all 3 servers i get high ping, so please. Please put an asian server. Thank you!"
22942,I really enjoy this game and its free!
22943,"how to fix Invalid approach? 
I cant play it"
22944,i can't report or kick f*cking hackerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
22945,"Whats happening?? I can't enter the game!! played 10hours on it and now I can't enter the game. Launcher seem good but I can't enter into the game!! PLEASE HELP ME ASAP!! I WANT TO PLAY NOOOOOOW!!!!!! :((((
"
22946,pay to win
22947,"As an early access game, it’s quite good so far, how the developers seriously need to stop and ban those players who cheat and hack, it ruined the experience for every other player when a player is firing a rocket launcher constantly without the need to reload...."
22948,Really Nice Game Just One Thing Could You Please Put Steam Controller On There Other Than That Its A Good Game
22949,Felt like call of duty only worse
22950,"Game is awesome. F2P not P2W. *skins* are a bit odd . But less servers. Need those Asian Servers quick. Please Asian servers . Would be appreciated by all asian/surrounding gamers.

Update: Game was F2P, now its P2W, P2P etc.,,,  just another bunch of money eaters."
22951,good game
22952,NICE GAME
22953,"I like the game, but it just feels cheezy to me. The first match I played I got highest score, and I'm not good att fps...
"
22954,"This is an amazing game and has an absolutely amazing future it is like call of duty and counter-strike put into one game that works amazingly It does have some bugs here and there, but it is still massivly skill based due to seeing people raging because no bullets hit there opponents because they are running and gunning

8/10 great game has bugs but still in alpha
- dealz"
22955,[i]Love This Game <3[/i]
22956,"Looks alright, runs good, hit detection seems to work fine. English translation could use some proofreading, and ""voice acting"" is just laughable. It's like a 20 year old nerd doing his best Buff Shooter McSoldierman impression, just check out that training mission.

It's a free CoD clone. It's bland and shallow and repetitive, much like the actual CoD, but if you like this kind of games - you could do much worse than this."
22957,this game dumb
22958,Asia server please!
22959,"What a garbage game, first match i get into and half of the screen is cut off. This happened by just simply raising the sensitivity mind you... If you are 8 years old and have the macintosh, i recommend it. If you are serious about a real fps... DONT GET THIS GARBAGE NOT EVEN TO JUST TRY IT. Put your dick in a box and you might have more fun than this fucking garbage."
22960,gut game
22961,CS:GO but fun
22962,"GREAT GAME ALOS BIGG SUGGESTION ADD ZOMBIES AND IT WELL BE PERFECT
"
22963,gNARLY
22964,"Very good game, its unbalanced but at least is fun with friends"
22965,not bad
22966,that good
22967,"This could be a good game but they desperately need mics. It is pretty decent, especially for a free a game but it is not good enough to make me want to stay on forever so I can try and meet random players in the chatroom to play with only to hope that they are elite players like myself and have a discord to actually communicate with, only later to learn they are bums just like everyone else I ran into while playing this game jumping in front of my gun fights, throwing bad grenades and flashbanging their teammates.

This has made me very mad and it is all because this game has no mics and there is absolutely zero communication. I am appaled. 

"
22968,"Need SEA server sea players lag like hell in other servers
"
22969,"Can this game get AI Mode to play offline or Zombies mode COOP?

It will be interesting to play to other bots depends on the diffculty and please try to make CTF (Capture the flag) i just think this game needs it. Plus all the maps middle are to complex and alot of cross. There really are no tactic when playing a large map. Sometimes all the maps are identical and thats really lazy. Its best to make 2-3 way to Site A or B, And Make sure don't make middle connect to all the sites. If you play 5v5, it will make it harder for them to defend or attack. Please just make the map not complex, i coudln't remember all the maps even in 1 hour. It should take about 10-20minutes to learn the maps. Its my advice to your future carrer of making these maps and gamemodes.

Thanks, Zackler"
22970,"es vury geed gaem, wood recoomond"
22971,This is a very good game. It's kind of like CoD with a Counterstrike: Global Offensive feel twisted in there. 10/10 would recommend.
22972,"This game is like a cross between Battlefield and Counter Strike, if you are familiar with CS then youll be right at home. The game seems very well balanced to me and I can definately see room for improvement considering this is an early access game. Id at least give it a try its not for everyone but at least its free to play."
22973,"The prices for the ingame items are very fair, but this positive point alone does not rectify the glaring issue this game has, bad gameplay.

My experience:
I went through the tutorial which felt like watching a cutscene made by a 12 year old in MS Paint thinking to myself: ""Well It won't let me change my graphics settings yet so hopefully it will be better afterwards."" I was wrong, everything was already on max settings apart from anti-aliasing which I turned to full. It still had aliasing problems when playing a multiplayer match as well. The sound design is absolutely horrible and sounds far too rough to be pleasing on the ears, just loud banging the entire 5-10minutes I played. 

I was a little astounded when playing my first match to see enemies in our spawn area as we were respawning. I thought maybe we are invulnerable while here to deter enemies from just spawn camping, nope. Myself and another teammate walked into the enemy spawn location where we just sat and headshotted other players as they respawned. Then I was disconnected from the match and my game crashed.

In conclusion:
Avoid this game if you are looking for a new FPS to play, it is a poorly designed and developed game on par with mobile game first person shooters, despite its description claiming it is the best thing since sliced bread.

Also the default key binding for sprint is your scroll wheel."
22974,its like a cod online sorta
22975,Gotta say the game is pretty awful. Think I will stick to my horror survival open world games xD but worth a try
22976,"I just started playing and I love this game, the best so far I have seen. I would love to see this game in Linux plataform."
22977,Very GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
22978,"10/10 
Would take black squad over 59.99$ COD ANYDAY ~"
22979,"Many things have changed over the few months. So i'll start with the pros this game has, followed by it's cons.

PROS
1)Fast-Paced
-The quick match choice the game has allows for people who doesn't mind random possibilities and can jump right in to action. Which gives the game a decent consistency of no-need-to-wait.

2)Unique
-Guns have grenade launchers, all rifles can be equipped with laser sights, suppressors. And having bullets remaining in your clip actually reduces reload times gives the game a ""unique"" impression to me. This may seemed pretty optimistic to say so, but it is sth worth mentioning.

3)Good Alternative 
Let's say you're tired of CSGO, AVA, CF etc. This game isnt really a new game but being the fact its published by steam in a recent matter. Its actuallly worth TRYING. (i capped trying for obvious emphasis)

Now......thats basically all i can say for the pros of this game. Time to start with the cons.
1)Imbalanced weaponry.
Many weapons in the game tends to have a similar stats. You will notice that the assualt rifles are either
-Sprayable, accurate, but kinda weak in firepower.
OR
-NOT sprayable, CAN be accurate, Headshot on 1 taps.
and thats basicallly it. Nothing special for all the weapons. 
In conclusion, you don't see a lot of various ""styles"" the game has offered for the weapons.

2)Unbalanced matchmaking in Quick Matches.
Encountering 1 or 2 smurfs/ highranked players is quite a common sight in any pvp games. What about facing a team of high ranked players WHILE you have a team of rookies. Thats something quite frequently occurs in my experience of playing this game for 41 hours. And without a doubt, we received an awful lost. In conclusion, the matchmaking has space for improvements. 

3)Everyone is using the same weapons!
I mean yeah, there's the Hnk, theres the typ95, R5, etc. but no matter which match you are in, TDM, or demolitions. Everyone is using an M4! or an Ak! Yes i know, they are good weapons, one taps, or accurate and decent damage. But its quite discouraging and you can say indirectly tedious. Getting killed by the same weapon aside, seeing how others only use that weapon is quite leading me to wonder is it pointless to buy other weapons. making the game tasteless and sorta not long game viable.


Overall, the game is WORTH TRYING. But is it worth playing the game for a long time, that depends whether u have the commitment for the game....and perhaps friends who also joins you to play this game."
22980,"Installed.

and then uninstalled....

It wasn't necisarily bad..... it was just lacking.
I guess it is a free to play but i still hate the shop systems
The gameplay was super fast paced. like. i could kill a guy and then he'd meet me back where I killed him in a matter of seconds. could just be that the maps are tiny. 

and the graphics....

oh boy....

i guess its still free to play....

Sorry if any of my words or grammar offended anyone. love you all, just not the game"
22981,"Before you play, I warn you that there are so many laggers in this game. In addition, the laggers in this game have an invincibility coat, When you have a good ping you need to shoot laggers 4 to 5 seconds before they can die or recieve damage and by that time you already dead. In this game its so common to see people over 220 ping on the top because they dont take damage from you if they can kill you within 4 to 5 seconds. At least punish the laggers first because it is ruining the game."
22982,"Was expecting a mindless shooter, like CSGO lite with CoD elements. Seeing as CoD titles are literal garbage on PC, plus activision destroying it anyway they can.

This game however isn't like that at all. Like a fast-paced Insurgency, there's no monotony and takes somewhat getting used to. 

Games are quick and have the feel of being simplistic, but doesn't go far enough.

For that, it makes it another generic shooter and those are a dime a dozen. It doesn't capture the essence of what made Call of Duty so appealling.

That may appeal to others but for me, I'm looking for a 'turn-off the brain, and hold down left-click' type of game. This doesn't do that.

- -

UI: Convoluted, hard to find anything at first glance.
You can't even speak in chat without first unchecking boxes in the settings, and even then you have to google how to even type into chat, as it's not listed in controls. 

Skills/Perks: I have no idea what tutorial was trying to show me and how that carries over into multiplayer. It's like two different games. And having to equip grenades and not being default is just ""why""?

Controls: Annoying, and confusing. 
F1, F2, F3 pick your classes. Press Space to confim. 
I did however like the middle mouse hold to pull out knife quickly. That was pretty neat.


Overall it's free, so play it without feeling like you wasted money or save yourself the time and play any other game that this copies from."
22983,"Really cool game, I can't wait to see how it would look like after it's done. Highly recommend this game to everyone!"
22984,"First thing first, game starts without crashes. Heard about few people complaining about the game not starting at all, it's alright guys, try reinstalling.

Smooth gameplay and its fun. Funny sound effects shooting your opponents.

Can't say its the best but it's fun. With bugs and crashes being fixed with updates, it sure can set the bar up high. Plus it takes only 5GB of space. All I can say is try it out. Don't always trust the reviews. Just try it out."
22985,"Its just so bad, can you even call this a game. the layout is so hard to maneouver, map layouts are trash, no strategy required.

Only good thing is that it's free"
22986,Its like CSGO with down syndrome.
22987,TAC RELOAD!
22988,love everything.
22989,This game is so hacked its almost unplayable
22990,"It's like CSGO, but worse.

CSGO is like Insurgency, but worse.

Just go play Insurgency."
22991,this game is awful
22992,"Pros: 
Free to Play and No Pay to Win Aspects
Decent Gunplay
Good Variety of Guns
Decent Graphics and Good Optimization
Good Run and Gun gameplay
Guns are not super expensive. If you play a lot you can easily unlock them all without spending a dime.

Cons:
Complex User Interface
Map design allows spawn camping (You do get a short shield when you spawn which allows you to get to cover)
No lost accuracy when moving making the game extremely run and gun
Snipers are pretty much only useful for spawn camping
Attachments are pre installed which means little to no gun custimization
Map design and variation isn't great
No Sprint button. Sprinting is the same as CS: GO (you have to pull your knife out to move faster)

Overall a solid F2P shooter. Feels a lot like Call of Duty. If you're into COD, you'll like this game. If you hate COD you probably won't like this game. If you're anywhere in between give it a shot it is a free to play game. I'm excited to see where the devs go with this game.

""The Fox""

Dog goes woof, cat goes meow.
Bird goes tweet, and mouse goes squeak.
Cow goes moo. Frog goes croak, and the elephant goes toot.
Ducks say quack and fish go blub, and the seal goes ow ow ow.
But there's one sound that no one knows...

What the fox say?

Big blue eyes, pointy nose, chasing mice, and digging holes.
Tiny paws, up the hill, suddenly you're standing still.

Your fur is red, so beautiful, like an angel in disguise.
But if you meet a friendly horse, will you communicate by mo-o-o-o-orse, mo-o-o-o-orse, mo-o-o-o-orse?
How will you speak to that h-o-o-orse, h-o-o-orse, h-o-o-orse?

The secret of the fox, ancient mystery.
Somewhere deep in the woods, I know you're hiding.
What is your sound? Will we ever know?
Will always be a mystery what do you say?

You're my guardian angel hiding in the woods.
What is your sound? 
A-bubu-duh-bubu-dwee-dum a-bubu-duh-bubu-dwee-dum

A-bubu-duh-bubu-dwee-dum
I want to, I want to, I want to know!

"
22995,"Never wrote a review before, but I already love this game so much. This will become one of the best games on steam if the devs keep it p2w free. Don't waste your money on CoD titles, this game very easily fills that void."
22996,"Its an okay game, if it was released on mobile devices instead of steam. Otherwise, its just a god awful game."
22997,"For a free FPS game it's not bad but it needs A LOT of improvements.
Having to hold your knife out to sprint is bullshit no matter what, some the maps just feel to clunky and tight for TDM matches. Aiming down sights doesnt feel to great and the recoil feels insane and i dont see much recoil when blindifring which puzzles me, i get more kills blindfiring (from a long distance) than aiming down sights. When i get a kill or get killed i'm left feeling confused because, it just doesn't feel consitant."
22998,This game has alot of potential. I can tell with just a couple matches played that it is very balanced. No one gun is better than the other. The major problem this game has is the lag. No matter what graphics settings you use every turn you do will be laggy. Hopefully this will be fixed in time which would make it a fantastic game.
22999,uhhhhhhhhhhhh its another csgo copy but its actually decent i guess
23000,"TL;DR: One of the best F2P shooters out here WITH NO PAY-2-WIN feature at any possible point.

I'm really fucking impressed just by how fair the game is. It isn't even slightly pay-to-win at all so you can't buy weapons with any SUPER-DUPER-HYPER-COINS-thing and that's really really REALLY cool because the only thing that matters in the end is your skill, plus rifles, smgs, sniper rifles - basically any kind of weapons isn't expensive either. You can easily earn cash for them. The graphics aren't too bad either, especially if you consider the fact that it's F2P. Oh, and it runs very smoothly even on Low-end PCs. I definitely recommend it to everybody who loves fast-paced FPS games and does not want to spend any money to have fun from the game itself."
23001,cool
23002,"Too buggy to play. This game looked promising so I downloaded it. The opening tutorial bugged out to where I just completed all objectives while standing at the spawn point. After I ""completed"" the tutorial it then gave me no options in which to play the game other than to play the tutorial again. UE3 development is about as spoon fed as you can get so if there are issues with being able to complete the tutorial let alone even play the game I'm guessing this game will be plagued with issues for it's probably short life cycle. I wish I could tell more about the gameplay, but there was none available."
23003,My crappy laptop can handle this game smoothly but when you first play its hard to get up the ranks becuase of the controls
23004,it is very funny and its very cool:)
23005,Great game. Not enough players though. If this had a constant amount of players it would be a very popular game
23006,"Being this is early development I will be kind though offer some feedback on the mechanics.

Over all seems like a game I would be willing to play if it was complete when I found it as seems to be a game that is enjoyable and worth spending time playing.

That said note to the developers. The run mechanics just feels so sluggish. I feel like I am running in slow motion with walk being more proper. Should look at how the run motions acts as I just feel like in some ways I am walking because of how sluggish feeling the run mode is.

Other then tht seems OK and one I will stick with as it goes through developement!"
23007,I love the game
23008,"Good game for the low price of nothing.
Somewhere between cs source and cod.

The good:
+solid fps on old hardware.
+easy mechanics.
+free.

The bad:
-no ambient sounds makes the maps feel lonely.
-limited matchmaking.
-typical free to play fps gun store."
23009,es muy lit
23010,"Pretty Good Fps, Recommend for Cod and Csgo players.
But there is flaws.
Campers.
Sit in a corner with a shotty/rifle and just wait for prey"
23011,I can't believe this game is free. Enjoy!
23012,Recommended.
23013,ZZzZZzZzZz
23014,"Not able to play the game past the ""PLAY"" button which actually sucks because all my friends are playing it. Please fix this issue, but other than that it looks great."
23015,"good and has potential. but, already came across auto-aim cheater on my first match. and no, im not just scome guy who screams cheater when i lose."
23016,"Half a magazine to kill someone? Come on now, I thought we were past CoD standards, even if this is a freebie."
23017,"love the game but to day for the 7 day i never got my 500 med and 15.000 gold ;c
"
23018,awesome game i give it a 5 star *****
23019, best f2p game i ever played
23020,The game is pretty fun so far as a fast paced cod clone. Do wish they improve on the tutorial. I would like to see them have an insurgency based Tutorial tbh.
23021,"This is a review after 2 Days playing so dont take it serious.
Pro:
-No Pay2Win
-Weapon mechanics are made for Competetive
-Gun Balance
-interesting Game Modes.
Con:
-Poorly made Maps
-Korean FPS like (Sniper Only)
-no Spawn switch on TDM ( Maps are made for Base Campers who annoy you)
-too less support of Servers (I have people with 300 ping in my game in Europe)

I Didnt liked it that much but you can try it yourself its a 50/50 for me i say negative because i dont have fun at it."
23022,"As someone who is generally skeptical of free-to-play titles, particularly with FPS games, I am shocked at what I've stumbled upon here with Black Squad.

I've been playing FPS games on PC and console for sixteen years and let me tell you, the netcode and hit registration in this game is no joke. It makes CSGO, Battlefield, and CoD netcodes seem like they were hacked together by middle school children; considering the budget difference it’s actually quite embarrassing for the bigger publishers. This is coming from someone who is a long-time Battlefield and Counter-Strike player (and occasionally CoD fan, particularly pre-2010 titles).

Netcode is undoubtedly the most important underlying factor for a shooter, but there's a lot more this game does correctly:

- All weapons unlockable without any premium / monetary investment
- Premium weapons are literally stock weapons with skins. Zero statistical advantage. 

So now that we know the game has a solid foundation, let’s get into details:

- Starting weapons shred people, so you are golden from the moment you begin your first game
- No automatic health regen
- Multiple classes, each with their own killstreaks (4 per class) 
- Killstreaks (which are obtainable with objective points as well) are reasonable, similar to what you saw in CoD 4 
- If you have good muscle memory and decision making, you will not lose a firefight unless it is entirely your fault

Black Squad's game modes are a great deal a fun, and they put together a well-rounded list of options. There's classic TDM, VIP, and Demolition (5v5 and 8v8), however I'm currently gravitating toward Battle Match (16 v 16) which features multiple objectives that need to be destroyed by both sides. 

Maps are comparable to current AAA titles -- there's long stretches for snipers, close quarters for runners, and generally an assault rifle or carbine will serve as your adaptable option. You have three class kits to customize, so you can easily adapt to the circumstances of your game.

There are three live currencies: 
- Gold (Purchases 14-day items. Earned through many general tasks/games/achievements/etc.)
- Medals (Purchases permanent weapons. Earned through more difficult challenges.) 
- BS Coin (Purchases cosmetic variants of weapons)

Overall I'm surprised to see myself get slightly addicted to this game. Did I mention the netcode was perfect? ;) 

Considering it's free, this game is worth your time and effort to try. Really hope the developers stick to this formula and just add more maps. Everything else is great. 

"
23023,Pretty fun for a free game. Cant Complain
23024,devs very good yes
23025,fun for a bit but gets boring quick
23026,"Good game as long as you can get use to your aim sensitivity as your look. I can not tell you how many time I have died because I either can't move to where I am getting shot, or sensitivity is way to high to even aim. Would be a lot better and would over take a lot of other First Person Shooters if you could adjust it."
23027,This game seems to be a good successor to AVA.
23028,"First of all let me say that this is a great game, but without a PING CAP the Taiwanese (aka or pingers) have 200+ ping advantage, it is not skill related. This game is RIGGED for the Taiwanese to win.
Auto Balance is based on ping for the 200+ ping Taiwanese.
Make a PING CAP and this game has plenty  of potential. 
In it's current state it is not worth playing.
You can't even dodge the high ping Taiwanese considering there is a leaver penalty (Because id gladly leave vs full teams of 200+ ping Taiwanese."
23029,literally ive played 6 hours of nothing but 200 ping players who lag around EVERY SINGLE GAME -10/10 the game itself is ok if they made a ping lock it would be good or servers
23030,"All I have to say about this game is, good pretty balanced the only fail it's the Brazilian community in the South American servers so i have to play in North American server with higher ping (80 - 100) I think you should add a live report system in the middle of a match (TAB> Click Player info> Report) so this player can have a chat mute for hours/days"
23031,"it so bad that it good kinda game. that you need to play.
IT LIKE COD HAS ONE NIGHT STAND WITH CS:GO..........."
23032,This is absolute garbage
23033,shity game 0/100
23034,"this game is for cucks 
"
23035,"actually was very suprised by this.  Feels really good, great hit reg, pretty basic as far a shooters go but it works, its not P2W and the maps appear designed well for now that there is always some way to flank.  most games ive played have been relatively close!"
23036,Terrible game hackers crawl all over it using aim hax but mostly wall. They graphics are shockingly bad with awful maps its a rip off of csgo on COD.
23037,"Very good game
Should download"
23038,"Quick tutorial that rewards a permanent gun (200K coins)
Lots of settings for customisation, good crosshair settings
Lotta fun so far"
23039,fuckin fun
23040,"Very Boring to play, Feels like I'm playing a bad Call of Duty. 
Movement feels weird and not that precise.
The ability to chose which server you want to play on is absurd and will cause  many problems."
23041,Great game and easy to get in!
23042,the most like it the best
23043,"Really, fun. Especially that its free AND NOT PAY TO WIN. IT IS NOT PAY TO WIN.

I played it at first a few days ago and tbh got bored of it...played it again yesterday and woah, i found myself about to play it right now!

I play games like battlefield 4, battlefield 1, 7 days to die....this is different.

This is cool. Totally worth a try."
23044,this game brings something special and it's only just the start...im geeked about the future of this game.
23045,"One of the best F2P FPS games in a while. 
No P2W, balanced weapons. 
Devs are listening to the feedback and so on.

Would recommend."
23046,i love this game but unfortunatley every time i try to play the tutorial the game starts and then it crashes hopefully they fix this issue in the full release. sometimes it doesnt even let you start the game
23047,"This game is an instant must-have for anyone who even dabbles in the FPS genre. Whether you play all the time or just a match or two a week, everyone wants a shooter that runs well, finds matches fast, and isn't P2W.  It's a free game that I would have gladly paid $20 for as it stands now (fresh after launch). I'm excited to see how the devs and community are going to shape this game. 

Pros:

-Quick match finds matches very quick.
-Fantastic servers. I've never once disconnected or had a teammate lag out on me.
-I really like the in-match leveling system. Basically, every match you start as a private and move up in the ranks based on score. This rank is displayed above your head for the team to see. This allows you to see who's worth sticking with on your team and who might need extra help without constantly checking the scoreboard. It's also just a cool way to measure your contribution to the team.
-No disadvantage for new players. You can buy the gun you consider the very best before you play your first match.
-Fantastic hit detection.
-Fast-paced. No killcams or lengthy respawn timers. 
-Maps (while they will also appear in the ""cons"" list below) are easy to memorize, have clear hotspots, and at least 2-3 main pathways from your spawn.
-Invulnerability on spawn lasts long enough to prevent spawn killing, but not long enough for you to run into the fight with magic armor.
-Combat rewards patientce and skill. There's no aim assist or generous hitboxes. Spray n' pray has no place in Black Squad.
-Free DLCs let you try every primary weapon in the game for 15 days. So, if you're like me and jumped the gun (no pun intended) with your purchases in the beginning, you can use every AR, DMR, PDW, SMG, and shotgun in the game for 2 weeks, which is more than enough time save up for your newfound favorite.
-Personally, I haven't seen any hackers yet. *knock on wood*
-Community seems fine. I've seen more ""gg"" than ""kys,"" which is always a good sign. Still too early to tell.
-Low system reqs-- because war doesn't have to look pretty. Still, it doesn't look bad at all IMO.
-Ragdolls are satisfying, though some might think they're over-the-top. Idk. I think it adds character to the game when bodies go flying across the room.
-No OP melee, meaning that pulling out your knife is either for movement speed or a true last resort, as it should be.

Cons:
-Maps are ridiculously small, which is great sometimes, but they're too easy for a good team to dominate. I realize that introducing larger maps is risky for a game with no sprint mechanic (especially if you advertise being fast-paced) but it's not a true military shooter if everything is close quarters.
-Guns aren't fully balanced, but who was expecting that this soon after launch? Sniper rifles zoom in just as fast as an AR or SMG, and there was nearly no sway on the one I used, if any. I suspect this is to make them even somewhat relevant on these small maps and that this will be changed later. KSG could use a slight range nerf, etc.
-No weapon customization at the moment aside from a few skins, but I hope we'll be able to use different sights and attachments on compatible guns.
-Everyone looks the same by default. You can pay real money for new models if that's your thing, though. Still, I hope we'll be able to unlock cosmetic options in-game as well.

Objectively: 7/10
Considering it was free and just launched: 13/10"
23048,pls make a server for asia. we get horrible ping playing in other servers. untill then not recommend
23049,"For a free-to-play game, this is an awesome game. It's just like CoD Modern Warfare franchise, except Black Squad is free"
23050,"For a Early Access video game FPS, its really good. Great mechanics, but, some of the guns still need some work, by Accouracy, Power, and Ammo.
This game it is great for new FPS community, Teen and Adults, and great gameplay.
From 1 to 10, I'll give it 7.9/10."
23051,Decent shooter. I dont like that you can just buy a gun he suits you with all attachments needed by just starting you game. I like to work for what i get.
23052,On i7-4770 with GTX1060 and game stuttering from Menu to in-game. Deleted.
23053,"makedem
"
23054,"Free to play, free DLC, great graphics, great gameplay, high fps even on bad PC's, no glitches considering it's in early access. It could you use a better,cleaner main menu,Overall a great game and you should download it,just do it it's free to play :D"
23055,"This game is very realistic, I love the real combat feel of the game (I would love it if it was one hit kill though).
It has sort of a pay to win feel about it, but with all of that said.....................................Its better than all the other free first person shooters (warface)"
23056,"I went out of my way in order to leave a review for this game. The only other review I have ever left was for CS:GO.

*Background*
I have been playing counter strike since Source, and have played CS:GO since release. I am a high elo player who mainly plays ESEA competitively.

I also played f2p shootersy whole life and can tell the difference in a good game and a shitty one.

This game is amazing, AAA graphics, AAA development, and it's only early access. Since the game released they have already added several new maps. The weapons have recoil patterns that need some getting used too (recoil control) which I'm familiar with from counter strike. Already the game has alot of competitive players that mainly come from other games, however this game has a huge future. Without a doubt it is the best f2p shooter I have ever played. This game will blow up and I can't wait to be apart of what the game becomes. It's safe to say Black Squad has replaced CSGO for me."
23057,please create a SEA server. i want to play this game. thanks
23058,lol
23059,this is very good game runs on low graphic on bad pcs too on 30-40 fps i recomend its like cod and cs very well made game
23060,不能玩  布告是 什么 都重新下载好几遍了
23061,This game is fun! Looks like CSGO+GhostInTheShell+CallOfDuty! i really enjoy this game! hope u make more awesome weapon and more skin character! also.. dont forget to add Asia server! hard to play with 400ms..
23062,"Good luck playing in a US server when literally everyone else has over 200 ping and melts you as soon as you see them. How hard is it to put a server browser, or force people to join their home region?"
23063,The game is awesome!! It is something like CoD but much better.
23064,"GOOD GAME 
HARD TO FIND MISSIONS (I DONT KNOW HOW TO FIND MISSIONS BECAUSE THEY DONT SAY HOW)
THIS IS LIKE COUNTER STRIKE THEY ARE SAME 
BUT THIS IS FREE AND COUNTER IS 15$
CSGO IS BETTER"
23065,"The first 2-3 days was pretty fun, but now it's overrun with hackers and cheaters. And before people say ""you probably just suck at this game, git gud"", here is a statement http://steamcommunity.com/app/550650/discussions/0/1471967615850160450/ where they admit that their anit-cheat software isn't working right now. It's a shame since Black Squad is basically a good game.

My recommandation: If you want to play without cheating, don't play this game until they fixed it. If you're a goddamn pu$$y who can't get a kill without cheating, play it."
23066,"very good game, easy to use and very fun to play, would reccomend it."
23067,"Until now it is a very fun, fast paste FPS.
Sometimes you rage, a lott, but it is like the perfekt FTP FPS.
Not that expensieve guns, no pay to win like other games just cosmetics.
I hope it will stay like that in the future.

I also think this game could have a future in ESL and other leauges.
Tho the rules must be adapted on the guns.

TAC RELOAD!!!11!!"
23068,"-Game crash without any reason all the time
-Game has cheaters cuz no working anti cheat
-Valofe ban lot players without any reason
-Hit reg is broken, many times head shot makes 0 dmg
-Game has lot ppl playing 150-300 ping
 
So game is broken and should reported to steam, devs hasnt fix any probs."
23069,Recommend!
23070,"awful piece of unrealengine paste.
takes no skill, u only play against 500ms ping players cuz the devs are to incompetent to actually put a filter in that filters everyone above 150 out, lovely clientside hitdetection will kill u half a min after u are behind the wall.
150$ for a skins that u have to buy with BS (bullshit) coins is ridiculous. 

overall, trash game with no anticheat and high ping servers
ps: battleye aint an anticheat lolz"
23071,"Has the movement system of CSGO...
CSGO Hitboxes better than this...
Damage multiplier for each body parts are probably not yet implemented in the game(Hope they will)
But most of all...

Can use SNIPER All day, everyday

Thumbs up for those Sniper fgts out there like me.. :DDD"
23072,"This game is awesome, so much better than Warface, no sliding in this game."
23073,Is realy like Call off duty Black Ops III
23074,good.
23075,Nice game play.Looks just like call of duty for bad computer users.(like me)
23076,Fun game but team deathmatch maps are too small... Its just spawn camp each other until you win or sit at your spawn with a sniper and wait for the enemy team to come. It's a free CoD so that's cool but I wouldn't recommend unless camping corners is what you're into.
23077,Another trash F2P Korean game.
23078,I love this game great job :D

23080,"Tac Reload simulator 2017

Update: Game has some hackers in it, Player base is nearly dying usually hovers around 2.5k-5k Off-Peak hours and around 8k On-Peak. They need to do better patchs and a better UI system to make it more user friendly rather than appearing as some generic cash grab that was released on a web page like Cross-Fire."
23081,"Most unlogic game ever,
i'm used to play games like Battlefield, CSGO, CoD etc.
But games like Black Squad, Warface, Dirty Bomb are just unlogic for me.
How is it that i hitmark someone 7-8 times and he kills me with 2 shots? No he did NOT headshot me.
This is what i don't understand in this game."
23082,"Update 08-07-17:   
 The game had potential and promise, but seeing as there is no way to report cheaters easily. I see another failure in the works. Regional server localization is still an issue just left a game where no one other than myself had less than 200+ ping one player was even rocking a nice 400. Perhaps the game should be renamed ""Lag Squad"".

Previous Review:
Black Squad is probably one of the more solid and fun run and gun shooters I have played in a long while, and that says a lot for a game still in early access. More maps need to be added, client to server localization needs to be more optimized. It gets rather annoying when you get the first shots on a 200+ ping player in the server yet no matter how many times you shoot them they turn around and kill you with 1 shot, repetitively. Has the potential to actually be a competitive game except for that issue."
23083,"Just like every other f2p fps game.

Garbage"
23084,"Its just bad. It is CS:GO, but everyone has an AWP every round. Its a mix between CSGO and COD and it is just terrible. Also, the only guns that are decent are the ones you buy."
23085,"All I can say about this is one word: [b]Mediocre[/b]

Pros:
+ Pretty fast, but fun gameplay
+- Round amount of gun to choose from, they all serve some kind of purpose in the game
+ Symetrical maps (some of them at least) which means the map is balanced for both sides.
+ Interesting Sprint mechanics (need to get your knife out to run + knifing is actually effective in this game) 
Additional note: for everyone crying how Sprint key is Mouse Wheel, just f*cking remap it, it's not that hard.
+ No Pay2Win bullsh*t (you can only buy cosmetics which just look nice)
+ Easy to get into it, but hard to master
+- Pretty average graphics (not too bad or good looking)
+ No cheaters yet

Cons:
- ROF means too much in this game, even if you have a DMR.
- Hit-reg which fails me even more than in CS:GO
- Weird damage model
- Gets pretty boring too quickly
- Long match loading times + playing with high ping players (over 200 and such)
- Ping gives players advantage (their playermodels literally lag behind their actual placement, thus they see you first)
- Grindful gameplay (to buy a new rifle you need to win way too many matches)
- Overcomplicated main menu UI (too much things happening at once, main tabs are stuffed in the corner while rest of the screens serve no purpose)

In the end this is pretty ""meh"" game, nothing special or unique about it other than it's new. It honestly reminded me of those chinese ripoff FPS's on phones and tablets, that's how meh it was..... But for around 5 hours, I'm sure your gonna have fun."
23086,"Update: Game is very clear of cheaters, i havent met any cheaters in my 90+ hours in this game for now.
-New stuff is being added and guns are very balanced for now.
-Que time is under 1min almost at all times on EU Quick play servers.

23087,"Pretty good so far
"
23088,"I really enjoy the game from what i've played, very fast paced 

Only downside for me is the lack of australian servers"
23089,installed no problem. finish tutorial. seems like a good game. try to play the first match ever and get yelled at by a four year old named nylanx because i got in front of him while he was camping with a sniper rifle to rack up cheap kills. uninstall. seems like a great game. dont have time to be yelled at by a little kid.
23090,I like it.
23091,"Imagine the almost perfect Combination of Crossfire and Battlefield...

You get Black Squad"
23092,"Warface clone, difference is it is actually good."
23093,"Fun and amazing, but so many racists in this game... It's like game is filled with Trump supporters"
23094,"amazing game.  i feel like all the negatives are people who only played 2 matches and just gave up or cs:go fanboys. regardless if it looks similar to other games it is still a great game. The graphics are great, guns physics are more realistic than most games, and the dev team is continously patching to make the game even better. The only downside so far is the menu UI is a bit messy and not as clean looking like cs:go's menu page but that really doesnt affect the game itself. 10/10 would buy it if it cost money 11/10 would download casue its free."
23095,Basically Combat Arms if it was up to date and didnt suck. Good free to play FPS.
23096,"Not gonna lie: I've been waiting for this game to come out to play it and see how bad and pay to win it is like almost every other F2P FPS game that tries to leech money off of you with micro transactions but honestly; I'm enjoying it a lot. Low end PCs can handle the game relatively well and the graphics aren't bad at all (though some of the terrain graphics are meh). The gameplay is solid and the 5v5 mode is enjoyable for causal play. The only thing I can really complain about is the insanely fast TTK. The Deathmatch gamemode feels kind of dull since you can kill and die so quickly. 8/10 would recommend if you're looking for a casual, enjoyable, Free to Play shooter."
23097,"Very good free FPS game. Nice graphics, weapon choices, maps and most important no pay to win. My only suggestion is, the game needs bigger maps, they are too tiny. But other than that this one is going places, not sure yet where :)"
23098,"Very fast paced action shooter. Fighting style reminiscent of Titanfall 1 (without all the special abilities of course), due to the fact that there isn't much long ranged, or camping style combat. Games consist of a large amount of players crammed into relatively small maps, causing for exhilarating fast paced combat. This game could easily cost money, and would still have a large playerbase, but the fact that it is Free to play makes it all the better. Definetely a game I would recommend.

On a side note, graphics are very good, and demand very little of your system. I do have a GTX 1080, but I can run the game on three monitors (1080p each), at ultra settings, and maintain over 120 fps. Weaker PC's will have no problem running this game."
23099,"Really entertaining game, simple yet with a tactical feeling. Nice variety of guns too, I can only wait and see how this develops."
23100,"this game is actually dogshit, i vote yes so people think its good LUL"
23101,"i dont generally write posts. This game is definatley not for me. all it is people running around with op snipers. and the chat is more toxic then ive seen in alot of games. If the devs change the game alot i might play again, but as for now not gonna happen."
23102,"dope asf
"
23103,"Runs great, plays great, it's free."
23104,Ive only played for a little bit but the game seems great! For how new it is its optimized pretty well. I have a 1050 ti so my GPU isnt the best but i still got 80+ FPS on every match i playted. This game reminds me of CS:GO so if you like that then definitly try this game. I will definitly be playing alot more of this game!
23105,"First 30 minutes in and its already a very polished game, at least from what I've seen. Very balanced and looks decent for a f2p game. But don't go in expecting too much..."
23106,pretty good for an early access game very impressed
23107,.00.
23108,awsome game. action packed. a mix of csgo and oldschool cod.
23109,Too many hackers.
23110,This game is dogshit go back to korea. 9/10
23111,"I can say that this game is worth your time. 100% Not pay to win. Skill based also they give you enough in game cash to buy what you need to succeded. Also Play the tutorial as lame as it is. 

I would give it currently 7/10 very fun and simple nothing crazy. It is free as well. I like alot of aspects and am excited to see how it goes.

Also all the people saying its pay to win must suck at this kind of game."
23112,"Good if you are poor. Terrible graphics, terrible physics, terrible hit registration. Trying to rip off cod, doesnt do very well. Maybe I will revisit in 2 years."
23113,"Smh, This game is basically Call of uzi mixed with those arcade games at the bowling alley."
23114,Great game it just needs a small cooldown on the crouch spam...
23115,"First thing's first, this game is less than a week old. I'm aware it will go through many changes, and I will remain patient. My problem is weapon balancing. A lot of guns are too weak or too strong (Aside from snipers). The SMG's are practically useless and it would be dumb to take one over a rifle. For some reason you can snipe with shotguns. There is a trick you can do by spamming control when firing and you crouch up and down rapidly. This trick confuses the shit out of you and makes it pretty hard to hit whoever is doing it. As bad as the guns are in this game, it is extremely fun. You have TDM, 5v5 and 8v8 Demolition, Assassination and some other gamemode I've never played. It is fun to play with your friends and even alone. I recommend this game because developers told me to and they'd give me free BS and Bullets to open gun boxes. Please do not tell them I said this, as they made me sign a contract assuring that everything is to remain confidential. Have fun."
23116,"[b] TL:DR [/b] Fun game 2 play 2 pass your time. 8/10
                      Some what of a similarity to Special Forces 2.
                      Not very skillbased, majority of the players are still newbies. [spoiler] not too long tho :D pls read [/spoiler]


Not sure why everyone is mentioning how Black Squad somewhat reflects on CS:GO. That's not true.
It's more like Special Forces 2 and Contract Wars combined. Or just a remake of Special Forces 2.

It has multiple gamemodes, daily rewards, bunch of weapons for a game that released few days ago,
daily, weekly quests, multiple currencies.

There are a lot of unskilled players, who still are learning the game.
And there are very, very skilled players, concluding that there should be a competitive gamemode.

The TDM maps are very small, which is a problem. Very hard to stay alive for extended periods of time.
[spoiler] i know it's a DM but still [/spoiler] 

Lacking secondary weapons. (pistols) There's only 3 including the pistol you've given at the default.

Haven't seen any hackers yet. So if you think that you've found a hacker, think again, it might just be a very good player.
Not Pay 2 Win. The only thing to pay for are skins for weapons.

They should add cosmetics for the player models. Hats, gloves, shirts, etc.


This game has potential, but it still needs to be worked on. A lot. 
Not my type of [u] game [/u], but it's still quite fun to [u] play [/u]. 8/10, would reccomend.

23117,"I have played alot of shooters and i must say this is one of the best. For a free game it truly is a very good shooter. Most of the negative comments are about hackers, but i havent seen any personally. The game is fairly balanced lmg's are a little underpowered but other than that i really like it. Textures are nice looking and i like the sounds. But it is a FREE GAME and one of the best in my opinion so you should get this!"
23118,the game is good but it needs some bots that can move around and a way to play with your friends.
23119,I cant even make it start yo
23120,"Simply a Good Game.

It's GS:GO with more weapons, More Gamemodes, Better Graphics, Runs smoother, But not Skin Based."
23121,Confusing and bad graphics
23122,First things first... Wow. This game is so well balanced... Like at first I was thinking okay cool. A free to play game that looks like call of duty and plays like counter strike... This isn't the first one I've seen. I downloaded it saying what the heck we shall try it... I'm in love... Only 6 hours played in game and it's the most rage enducing competitive FPS game I've played in a while... It may look like a COD knock off but the Dev's here don't mess around. They go out of their way to fix the little bugs. It's kind of insane...
23123,nice game its like csgo
23124,This game is super laggy and you will not have fun! there is money and you start with 200000 dollars but guess what NO! NOT FOR YOU it makes you buy a terrible/Ok Gun so yeah dont download it!
23125,The screen was so black my local police shot it.
23126,"yea uhh its fun game young blood

(on a real note this game can provide a counter strike feel with some cod elements and crisp clean punchey hit marker and gun sounds)"
23127,Reminds me of when I played Black Ops 2 on the PS3
23128,"Very unfriendly community, played 2 Games always Shittalk, at the end of the Game ''GGez'' ''L2p'' '' haha get rekt faggot'' Nice Game bad community, even CS got a better community. :)"
23129,"Even if it is an ""Early-Acces-Game"" there are MANY disturbing things for the Gamexperiance. The Developer said ""its a *Skillbased* Game"" well.. you might believe it... after you put on the Silencer with ""F"", activate the Laserpointer next to your Gun ""T"" and than fucking Spray`n Pray everything and everyone in your Path into Bits WITHOUT EVEN MISSING A SINGLE BULLET. Also i already encountered multiple Cheaters which sometimes just playin with an Aimlock (visible when you spectate) or Shoot you throught indistructible Metalcrates right in your li`l sweet tiny Head. And yes.. there are some Sniperriffles implemented, but there is NO Map, where you can really use it unless you love to try your quickscope-Skill in CQC`s against SMG`s and MP`s. Also there is the same Problem, which most of the other tripple A Titles encounter... Spawncamping. Your lovely meant ""you are involnurable for 3 seconds after Respawnprotection"" wont help that much. Because after you run out of Spawn, away from a thrown Grenade, get around a corner, you`ll face the next Gunbarrel right at your dumb lookin face and get your ass kicked back to the Spawn. Also; if you manage to get a Lobby outside the Baserape and Spray`n Pray TDM like HQ, you`ll maybe regret the decision after you spend around 3 Mags to kill one Guy with his ""Juggernaut"" Pointstreak and catch a friendly Bomb from the Harrier Airstrike. `Nought said. I really regret the decision of installing in on my PC."
23130,"I am a huge fan of FPS games and when this game came out on steam, I saw free to play, caught my eye and said screw it, let me try it. This game did not disappoint!!! It felt like CS:GO and COD 4:MW had a baby and this was it. Great fast paced action, adrenaline rush intensity, non-stop ""OH SH!T"" moments!!! Must try, highly recommend, ended up supporting the devs and bought the game; that's how much I enjoyed it!!! Give it a try and join the Black Squad, recruitment starts now!!!"
23131,"Couldn't stop laughing when I played. People die with one or two shots, it instantly respawns you, the map I played was tiny and you just die, respawn, die, respawn, die, respawn... it wasn't fun at all, it was just really, really funny. Graphics are ok, it ran smooth, fast connection, I liked the tutorial (and if the game were one person with missions like that it would be awesome), but for now... it's a no from me."
23132,This game makes Combat Arms look like it's on it's Beta stages
23133,"Stupidly unbalanced and an all round piece of shit game wouldnt recommend this to anyone who has an IQ level of over 1.
"
23134,"Maps are all the same with different assets, Completely pay to win, Infested with ESP and No Recoil Hackers. It seems like the developers of this game did not care to balance it.

This game is purely for entertainment (I enjoy how unbalanced it is) Its a CHEAP, RUSHED copy of Combat Arms.  The chinese developers of this game probably do not care at ALL about the game and are just trying to profit off the wallets of Americans who love instant gratification."
23135,Great game.
23136,"Fast paced action with a fast respawn so you dont have to wait to long after you die. Very much like csgo.
Weapons seem balanced other then the shotgun it feels a little overpowered.
So far early access beta is fun.

if you like csgo i recomend this."
23137,Very good game but the menu could use some simplicity other then that great game that is very similiar to many other FPSs but also very unique in itself.
23138,...
23139,"I saw this a few days ago and I thought it would be bad. Then I realized that it just came out so obviously it wouldn't be that popular, so I decided to give it a try. First impressions are surprisingly good. After messing with a few settings and playing nothing but 5v5 demolition, I can say that the one thing that really stands out are how good the maps are split into lanes and obvious paths to go. The 5v5 demo game mode is obviously inspired by CS:GO with the paths top the A and B objectives being painted in red. This is a really weird mix of CS and COD mechanics that surprisingly mixes well. For example, there is no sprint (Which I love in games because it influences good map design) There is only walk with shift, and walk faster with your knife out. Gunplay definately feels like COD but more like the older ones like COD4 and MW2. Snipers are OP but they are not always practical, Its actually exactly like how snipers work in MW2 and MW3. Lots of borrowed traits from other games, and thats what makes this game seem so familiar but new at the same time. As long as it doesn't become Pay to win and sticks with skins, then this will be a good free to play game."
23140,"Free shooty shooter
Worth it's price maybe not your time if you've paid for something better."
23141,"a combination between csgo and black ops....verry good optimized...nice animations....play to win.,..a nice imitation of warface but withouth hackers...for now:D"

It will be fun to play this game in ZombieMod, like in Combat Arms.

23147,"Short story: Black Squad has good graphics, high Frames per Seconds, excellent weapon balance, solid rising community. It is truly Free to Play. Black Squad is simply the best F2P PvP shooter on PC !

Long story: Black Squad is a kind of brilliant mix between CS GO and Ghost in the Shell (another Korean game). Let’s look first at its strong points:
* Runs smoothly on old computers. My January 2012 PC runs great with all details on. What a change from games such as Ark Survival ! Also no network lag.
* Weapon balance is impressive. ARs are versatile, SMGs / shotguns are close to mid range, snipers mid to long range. At first I believed snipers were at a disadvantage because characters move so fast. But if you pick the right spot you can do many kills and also deny access to enemy. Killing is great but blocking enemy is important too.
* Maps are well designed. There aren’t many per game mode but they are subtle.
* Black Squad is really Free to Play. You can download free access to weapons for 14 days. Twice. Great for testing before unlocking. In a month you can gather enough gold and medals to buy really many weapons. Only skins require real money.  
* Developers seriously listen to the community. Recently many players complained that shotguns were OP. Nerfed in the next patch !
* Character leveling up and daily / weekly missions are well designed. They give a purpose. In CS GO you play for ranking. In BS for medals and gold.

Now let’s look at the weak points:
* Servers are often down. Let’s hope this is just a youth issue.
* Characters move too fast. Bunny hops are lame. It’s okay to move fast with the knife. It makes the game fast paced. But it should slow down when carrying primary weapon. Slow down more than it does. Arcadish sprint and jumping around is good in a hero shooter such as Overwatch. But in a ‘serious’ military shooter it does not fit.
* No matchmaking based on ranking. Ranking is very important in a PvP shooter because it allows fair games. When noobs are crushed by vets they get frustrated and leave the game. Hopefully as the game grows, Elo based ranking will be implemented.
* Game modes. This is the main flaw of the game. Firstly there are too many game modes which spray the community. Secondly several game modes are sub optimal. Team Death match is great. Battle 16vs16 with skills like Overwatch / Paladins, why not. At first it seems chaotic. But a deep strategy is possible. Next game mode, Assassination 8vs8 is boring: when you die you might wait for a long time because a team of 8 is huge. Same for demolition 8vs8. Demolition 5v5 seems good. But it requires coordination. Unfortunately, contrary to CS GO, nobody uses a mic. And many players don’t even understand the basic strategy of demolition. They play like death match. And they get crushed.
What lacks badly is a capture the flag mode.

To sum-up, despite game modes flaws, Black Squad is the best and most popular F2P PvP shooter available. Give it a try !

23150,"Finally after 9 months we get the very popular asian game publicly on steam! 
here I made a simple list for you to look at.

pros:
- very balanced game
- better graphics than csgo
- great performance on laptops
- also cheaper case openings than in csgo!
- re-Incarnation of the popular games like War Rock and Combat Arms
- also more customization than csgo has, even in EA and has an even better ranking system
- having slow internet gives you the power of ghost killing!
- FREE AHJAHSKJFJHKAJDFJKAHkfhajkHjhslop

cons:
- Speedhaxors everywhere (probably also others)
- puts you in a losing game going 0-5 and the top player on your team has 2 kills (you win at 6-0)
- the ingame stat specs of a weapon don't match their performance in game
- flamsors everywhere
- global chat is russian or german
- 80% doesn't know this gaming genre
- VIP killed me twice in this time...
- clans do nothing but giving you extra characters to your name
- noscoping, jump shooting, 420 blaze all don't work in this game

I would rate this 5,36/12 for now..."
23151,"The game is pretty dope, but what's up with the sudden increase of hackers (wh and aimbot), every other round I see few cheaters.. Fix that sh*t"
23152,"Now, I played this during its Closed Beta so, thats where i'm basing this off of. 
But, Here's my run down of the game. 

[u] Gameplay/Weapons [/u]
I'm throwing both together because of this simple reason:
 - Sniping is literally useless. Most of the players i encountered on Black Squad were all using rifles or smg's and just rushing people with sprays. Sniping was pretty pointless. The only thing you could do as a sniper was sit in one spot, and just shoot. thats it. Thats all every sniper did, aside from myself. I sniped 99% of the time i played the game. Sniping on Black Squad is nothing like CSGO, COD, Battlefield, whatever game you snipe on. You either have to be standing/crouching, have to be still, and they have to be on the dot. You can't flick, you can barely quickscope (i managed to do it a couple times out of luck). If you can, well. Maybe it was just me. It also could have been that i saw maybe 3 North American players a game, and the rest were South American's with 150+ ping, so.. idk. 

[u] GAME MODES [/u]
>[b] Team Deathmatch [/b]
 - Now in the CBT we only had 2 maps. If there are more now that its released.. i have no idea. But the maps are very small. You can run over to their spawn if you manage to get through/by the other team. Every game i played on TDM was pretty much the same, at some point in the game, one of the teams would push forward into the others spawn. Then once they died, the other team would push forward. Many of them would camp by places they knew enemies would run to, and just feed off it. 

>[b] Assassination [/b]
 - Now, others didnt really like the game mode, i thought it was cool. But it was just too easy. If you were on the assassination team, you could just run around the building, jump to the scaffolding that happens to look over at the hallway of windows the VIP is gonna run through, and then pick him off. I did it every round and if my team didnt kill the VIP, i did. It was that easy. Mostly because everyone on defending would run toward the enemies spawn, waiting for the team to kill the VIP and then kill the team when they tried to run back to the helicopter for extraction. 

>[b] S&D [/b]
 - I only remember 1 map for the Search & Destroy mode they had. It was larger than the TDM maps, but it wasn't all that great. It was a medium sized map, with a bunch of corners, and corridors to run through. It wasn't all that enjoyable. 

Honestly, the reason i'd ever play this game, is if i was really that bored. I thought it wasn't all that it was hyped up to be. It could have been better in my opinion. Play the game for yourself and make your own opinion. I'd give it 2/10 just out of generosity."
23153,"There is no TRUE reason to play this game, its a cookie cutter F2P semi-P2W game. There's nothing special to this game

It feels clunky: the movement is essentially CS:GO meets asset flip. people will teleport from place to place because their ping is a little higher than your's. 

Gunplay: most of the guns feel exactly the same with a different coat of paint. The guns are either too powerful and will destroy the enemy team or you are shooting spitballs at them. even with the best gun in the game, players take 20 bullets to kill, and even if you do kill them you might die because they shot a bullet before they died on their screen. This combine with the hit-reg isn't fun. you aim for the chest and get a headshot and vice versa.

Gamemodes:
1. Teamdeath match
Team death match is just your generic COD copy paste, nothing special about this gamemode whatsoever.

2.demolition 8v8/5v5
absolutly no teamwork, since there is no voice chat in game, communication with your team is nonexistant. 

3.assassination/VIP
assassination is a gamemode where you must either protect or kill the VIP. nobody plays this gamemode for whatever reason

4.Battlematch
now this is just a AWFUL gamemode. The point of it is to destroy these boxes scattered around the map and you earn points for your team. well this gamemode is just a grind fest. it take AGES to destroy one of these boxes and when you do you get no reward you get nothing, its such a waste of time to play this gamemode and try to have""fun"".

Clans: the only reason to ever join a ""Clan"" is to play with your friends, and even if you do queue up with your friends you might be connected to a different server than your friends. there are no benefits, no EXP boost if you play with your clan.

The Shop: the shop is probably the only thing had time put into it. the only problem is the guns are just there, no sorting of (PDWs,SMGs,LMGs,Snipers,Assault rifles,Pistols,Grenades). 

This game feels extremely forced, there's no ryhme or reason to ever install this game, there is absolutly nothing special about this copy paste of a game. The Grind is mind numbly terrible expectually if you want a weapon skin that looks like they made in photoshop in a starbucks.

I will come back to this review and edit it when it comes out of (scam your community) Early access

23157,Who needs a normal reload when we have a tactical reload
23158,For the three hours iv played this game it is really good and its free i find that so cool and yes they do need to nerf and buff a few guns like the starter pistol could do a little more damage but that could be just me bad with pistols but overall i find this game to be great
23159,"Very basic shooter, cannot recommend in its current state. It may get better over time, but not quite yet."
23160,love it
23161,It's good but it's way too hard and too many hackers everywhere
23162,good game but hackers on this already really annoying

23164,think the game is great hopefully more maps will come in time and an anti cheat seeing more hackers as the game continues

10/10 would reccomend"
23178,"1. Load up the game
2. Do the tutorial, game looks fun.
3. Find where to start playing with the ugly and cluttered UI that came from any Korean shooter game.
4. Load up a team deathmatch and get killed behind walls.
5. Get killed some more by ridiculously unbalanced shotguns.
6. Realize that you can camp spawns on insanely tiny maps with no depth.

Hopefully, the developers see this review, and many like it that write the same exact thing and they can do something about it. I gave your game a shot, now it's time to fix where your game is screwed up. Until then I'll be playing Dirty Bomb as my free to play game.

EDIT: Fix the zoom key set to actually work. That is a huge damper. If you've ever played any shooter you know how annoying it is to right click to come out of iron sights. It slows down an otherwise fast paced game."

23180,Bad
23181,Im enjoying this game.
23182,Best fps f2p <3
23183,its a fun game not p2w or anything like that its like csgo and cod had baby as you do loadouts outside of matches and can ads all guns but unfortunatly i can't recomend it every game all the highest ping players are on top of scoreboard idk why something with servers like they can shoot you from around corners from thier ping not relaying to your guy where they actualy are till you dead which leads to lots of frustration so if you do play play on a foreign server to get easy edge if they ever fix this prob i'd come back to this game untill then i cannot and will not recomend this game
23184,"It's got about everything you'd expect from a F2P FPS. Low res textures and automatic rifles with laser accuracy and no recoil are the name of the game. The questionable map design (some of which is blatantly copied from old successful F2P shooters) is only slightly less questionable than the grenade physics. The sound effects are god-awful and the cash shop has way more weapons than you could ever unlock by actually playing the game. All you really need is a shotgun for corner camping anyway, though. Seriously, this game makes me claustrophobic. So many tight spaces. I guess that's why the sniper rifles can double as shotguns too.

It's a good confidence booster, I guess. Everyone is either 9 or has 250+ ping so if you're even mildly competent at any other shooter you'll be the second coming of Jesus in this game. 

tl;dr: just buy counter strike. It goes on sale all the time and it's approximately 10 times the game that this is."
23185,"This game is what I wanted, the feel of an old Call Of Duty game, but with better graphics. This game has a high kill time, so you need to have good aim. Even if you have bad wifi or are far away from the server, you can still play normally. I strongly suggest trying it."
23186,wied filing when playn to half heave half thic and just really slow game not like warface that you can run fast and do what you want in this game you cant even run

23192,bad game.
23193,GOOD
23194,Amazing game really looking forward to see how it will develop in the future.
23195,"I've only spent about, I think less than an hour at this game. Now, you may think that ""Pffft- don't go judge the game yet without even spending a couple of hours playing it,"" BUT, let me tell you this: If the player doesn't kill you, the lag kills you.

Here's the thing. I like the game! Just from the tutorial itself and I had already gotten myself enjoyed it! The graphics? It's like you're playing with Crossfire (fellow asian players will understand) with COD4 graphics. Other players will of course, won't quite like it. But for me, I do like it. I'll let the other reviews point out the rest of the game since the message that I'm trying to get across here is this: If you live in any part in Asia, your ping will go above the roof!

The game right now, has only three available servers: North America, South America and Europe. Unforunate players, like me, will have no choice but to play in one of those three servers. I tried out playing my first game in NA and my ping is over 300! Sure, it may not sound like much to some, but whatever I do while I play, there will always be a SIGNIFICANT delay! The ""teleportation lag"" is real here. At one point, I was trying to walk towards the stairs and the next thing I knew, I was UNDERNEATH of it! And this 'teleportation lag"" happens every 5 or 7 seconds! Reloading is a hassle! When you press 'R', it will take at least 5 seconds before the actual reload starts! Heck, I can't even swith loadouts in-game! I keep pressing 'F3' so I can equip my sniper, and as soon as I respawn, I still have my SMG! Believe it or not, I actually am stuck to using the same gun every game, with no hope of switching in-game! WTF!

And you know the worst part here? I'm not alone. I checked out the leaderboard, and the ping of other players are so high, ranging from 280 to as high as 900! ALL OF THEM! I'm not kidding. Apparently, my fellow Asians wanted to play in the NA, so if you're American slash Canadian and want to try out this game, prepare to get overwhelmed with laggy players. 

""Well then, switch to other servers! What about in South America and Europe?""

Sure! If I wanted to suffer the same lag with no difference, then sure! :D

/sarcasm

Point is, the game is good. I like it, and it's really easy for anyone to get hooked into playing it, but the only thing that sets them back from truly enjoying the game is the latency lag. I will keep the game installed in hopes that the developers will add dedicated Asian servers (maybe even more), but for now, this game is a good ""NO"".

GOOD:
- Easy to play and understand, straightfoward mechanics.
- Not P2W. You can use the free virtual currency to buy any 2 weapons from the very beggining (even the one you consider to be the best).
- 15 days trial of all weapons (useful to spend the starting bonus).
- Still no hackers.
- Lot of weapons.
- Good servers, low ping.
- Real currency shop with ""cosmetic"" items (not affect the real ability on game).
- Low system requirements.

BAD:
- Very VERY small Deathmatch maps, even smaller than COD4. Not really well constructed. (no DM maps are fine).
- Graphics may looks ""Old"" for some people (Unreal Engine 3).
- Just one free model for your soldier, everybody looks the same!
- Right now, the current player base is unexperienced. It is easy to climb to 1st place from very beggining if you know other FPS (example: America's, CS, or COD4). Ah, and you may be called ""cheater"" or ""hacker""."

Having said that, lets get a little bitchy... Similar to other people I must mention that some of the DM maps are small, especially when you have a 32 player romp going on in a race to 150 kills. Small, hectic, frustrating and overall still fun.
We need Australian/Oceanic Servers. WIth the Current selection Available as Europe, North America, and South America. I have been Playing on the North American Servers and haven't had any terrible issues with latency.

I had originally expected more content within Black Squad than what is there at the moment, and by content I mean more cosmetic Items like different Player Skins, larger array of map selections. This being driven by the knowledge that the game has existed for 3 years, albeit in a different way/state. 

The Destruction mode is quick, no camping corners for 3 minutes to save your weapon, and no fear about having to manage an economy. You choose your loadout long before you get into game and you can swap in game between 3 options. Deathmatch is exactly as described and fast paced with rapid respawns, although the spawn protection does need some work.

Should you try it? Definately, I mean it's free! and whilst I cannot say whether the scary Pay2Win is present I haven't noticed anything, nor read anything which causes me pause. I can see it being a grind to buy different weapons, but aside from the shotgun, which is a bit OP, I can't see much benefit or defecit in a chosen weapon over another.

Game runs well on my mediocre system(which is not much better than the minimum recommended set up).

Looking for a break from CS:GO et al? Try Black squad, you can always uninstall it without haveing to ask for a refund.

now off to whine about AU servers, and their non-existence......"
23218,good game for free
23219,"Alright listen up deciders,
I bought the founders pack going into this game not knowing how it plays or feels.
I can say that was a very good desicion. This game is very good, so smooth, so easy to get into.
It feels like CS:GO and Call of Duty had a baby, thats Free to play. All weapons seem balanced, and are overpowered only in 1 way and always has a trade off. 
So far the player base is at the moment a bit too easy, and every once in a while you'll come across decent players. Its really competitive, and addicting.
                Yours Truly, ChhimPanzee"
23220,"When the devs will stop the 5 minutes notices with the servers beeing shut down for inspection then I will modify my recension.
It's happening almost every day, we are all getting disconnected in the middle of the game..."
23221,"Do you like being shot behind walls even tho you already have made it past open ground, then you have come to the right place for just a little of your time you can play with CHINA NUMBA ONE players, and their 200ping and they can legit shoot behind walls because CHINA NUMBA ONE. 

On a real note , game would be good if they have ping limits, 200+ ping legit ruins the gameplay in this. If you have 10-70 ping you've already lost."
23222,"This game is one of the best !

-Is free
-Good graphics
-Very good anti-cheat
-perfect match-macking
-Very fun
-lots of game modes
I will like to see more guns and a voice chat !
8/10"
23223,"Awesome potenial but one MAJOR problem for most people


The maps are way to small you can easily go into the other teams spawn and since the maps are to small as soon as one team controlls the middle of each map the game is completly over... You will lose.. Also maps are very linear and cause chaos..

ALTHOUGH

This game is really fun love playing it and as long as the Dev's keep working on it I see great success in the future"
23224,"I thought that this game had potential, but boy I was wrong!

#1 The game has horrible mechanics starting off with ""hold scroll wheel to sprint"" are you f****ng kidding me? You adapted the sprinting mechanics from Counter Strike (runs faster with knife---->""[strike]GENIUS![/strike]"") in the freaking fast paced FPS, this has to be the worst decision by you guys.

#2 Maps are designed badly, mostly players have nowhere to go but left or right and face the enemy within 5 second after their spawn time because if they go anywhere else they will get killed by shameless campers around the corner.

#3 Tutorial of the game was disgusting, you could have just made firing range rather than ""SPEC OPS mission"" type of thing.

#4 Some guns are just fine but some are straight up trash. I get it, not all guns have to be good but the starting Sniper Rifle/DMR is horrific. I chose the Recon class to try out the sniper rifle/DMR and I got disgusted by it. I had to pickup the enemy's gun everytime I respawned because the said gun was peashooter which has accuracy of -516 compared to any other gun in the game."
23225,it the best game in free to play
23226,"what did i expect from a free to play game? Clunky mechanics, Garbage combat system, Terrible hit registration. the only plus side i had for this game was that FPS were pretty good. My neigbors dog plays better than this game, and she's blind and deaf.....

oh an i almost forgot to add. Game claims to not support Pay2Win, but like most free 2 play games. thats a lie. you can buy OP guns right from the start if you are willing to pay cash for them."
23227,really fun game played it for 5h strigt!
23228,"If you have really good aim or have good FPS experience, you are able to average 30+ kills per game."
23229,"The worst game I've played in all my years on steam. Poor mechanics and physics. 
Claims there's no pay2win when you can buy the op guns early."
23230,"It didn't even let me play, all I got is ""Invalid Approach"" then the game shut's down, waste of time of download.."
23231,Love it so far!
23232,Very good!!!!1
23233,It is better than Counter Strike. I like it very much
23234,Really fun game. Lots of potential and I hope to see this grow into a competative game. I really with though that the game had a server browser. I hope this added in the future as it is still early access.
23235,nice graphic fast pace game
23236,"Does not Work with my Computer
Might i add i have 

Intel I7 6700k 

Gtx 1070 

32GB Ram
 Everything else SSD and HDD

theres no reason why it should not work

"
23237,this game is a joke. everything about it is wrong i mean everything.
23238,"The game is fine, but nothing great. Shooting is nothing but arcady. The game is closer to the older Call of Duty games then counterstrike.
I'm trying to give a positive review, but I can't recommend the game"
23239,Great game !!! Just add more servers such as ASIA (y) (y)
23240,"A game that tries too hard to be what it can't be, but the best that it could be is garbage."
23241,Free to play and a well rounded shooter. yes please
23242,"its not pay to win 
at least for now
good game its kind like CS GO and warface mixed but so far the game is pretty neat
i haven't encounterd any hackers for now
Download and try it out yourself why are you reading this!!!!!!!!!"
23243,"its hella fun i'll say its actually more enjoyable than csgo and any other ""free"" fps game out there imo, but everything have it downfall tho the game is fun and enjoyable the weapons in the game is not the most balanced and some weapon does need a buff or a nerf. tho the game is running really well i have to say that it need more server because i have seen people with high ping in most of the match i played. Tho the skin doesn't change anything from the game but its very expensive to get especially when you pay 10$ for around 10 crate and i can tell you that those skins are not dropping like rains. the weapons are unique but also hella expensive the only way you can get money fairly fast is buy waiting to rank up or daily mission and daily reward. overall this game is a good fps if theese things are fixed this game could grow as a very fast rate and maybe even could be one of the biggest fps out there imo. thanks for reading :D"
23244,Can You Add Mic in Game??? :v
23245,very good game...
23246,"Poorly optimized game despite subpar graphics with odd movements. Hard to control player. A cheap counter strike knockoff (But to be fair, I was never a big counterstrike fan to begin with). Tiny maps (which might be your thing). I honestly cannot find any positives about this game. It just feels so undone."
23247,"Very fun FPS. Lots of violence, speed and momentum with this game. Will be playing a good amount."
23248,"great game would be nice if they add a short range auto pistol like cz 75 auto from cs go,it would be a good firearm for sniper"
23249,"This game straight trash bruh, moving and shooting is whack, sprinting is whack, the whole game is whack, I tried killing someone onetime and they dissapeard. The game is BONE-IN!!!!!"
23250,"Stage four terminal cancer of the brain. DO NOT INSTALL, IT IS MALWARE FOR YOUR MIND."
23251,.
23252,fun free game to play!
23253,Its a good game but really for some reason doesnt run well with  7.87gb of RAM.
23254,"After three rounds in this game and topping the board on all three I have come to the conclusion that this game requires absolutely no skill or thought process to play. If you are looking for a mindless shooter where there is no recoil whatsoever, bullet spongeyness, shitty maps that evolve into shooting down the same two hallways, and literally so easy to play that any player with half a brain will top the charts easily then this is for you. To me these types of games are fine because they provide a few matches of entertainment just waxing people but the game is no deeper than that. You wont feel anything topping the charts, you wont feel anything getting a triple or quad kill, you will just keep killing and mindlessly doing so. 

So I guess it depends on what you are looking for. I probably wont be playing this game again so I am giving it a negative as nothing is there for me to want to continue playing it."
23255,"I enjoy this game. It's as plain as that. The only changes I think need to be made are the weapon damage rates. People should at least have a fighting chance when they come around a corner and someone prefires them. Other than that, well made game!"
23256,TacReload.mp4
23257,not very good
23258,"I originally gave this game a negative review due to poor performance and optimization alone. After letting the team release a few updates and reinstalling the game, I was finally able to play the game without any issues or drops in performance. I have to say, this is probably the most solid FTP shooter since Crossfire (the original version).

Pros
+ All weapon purchases are permanent
+ Gunplay feels solid and ADS is NOT required to hit shots
+ Movement feels similar to older CS titles
+ The bot system helps you learn pre-aiming angles across all maps and can easilly be set up to your own personal skill level (note that bots are stationary and added by keystroke)
+ There are viable options in the shop for in-game currency
+ The payed weapons are ballanced fairly well
+ Battleye anti-cheat
+ Hardly any cheaters (Super surprising considering the game's business model)

Cons
- Not all weapons can be purchased with in-game currency
- Those weapons DO have some advantage
- Semi-confusing UI (easy to overcome within hours)
- Some maps feel super generic even for a free to play title

With all that said, Black Squad is an all-around solid shooter with good gun play and tight movement. I would recommend this title if you're looking for something new to try. Fans of classic free to play shooters like Crossfire and Combat Arms will enjoy this game as well.

Disclaimer: This is a review, meaning that it is only an opinion. Take everything you've read with a grain of salt. You may play the game and feel differently."
23259,"Pros:
-Map design is great; most maps are three-laned, but have alternative routes to flank.
-Weapons are balanced, there isn't really such a thing as one good weapon in this game.
-Medal Shop is where most of the ""P2W"" weapons are, but it isn't Pay 2 Win, because everyone
has to grind to get these weapons with an alternative currency known as ""Medals"", and you can't buy them
with real money. You earn Medals by playing the game.
-Hit Registration is phenomonal. Like... amazing.
-Weapon feedback is great, killing people feels nice, the sounds that play after a kill are N U T T Y.

Cons:
-Assassination Mode is dead. Nobody plays it.
-The community can be toxic at times.
-KSG OP pls nerf

I rate it 4/5."
23260,Black Squad is an Amazing game and its free and one of the best shooters ive played
23261,great game and a lot of fun
23262,"its a really nice game.
"
23263,crates.
23264,Up for this. Best FPS!!
23265,"Like CS:GO but for free. Good game and would reccomend. The only bad thing is that there is occasional frame stutter, which is very bad for a FPS game. I am sure that the stutter is not my computer because it is very high-end."
23266,there should be a competitve mode... that would be dope
23267,Horribly RNG based game. Spray and pray. No skill involved. Hit reg awful. Movement too quick
23268,"It's just to buggy and unstable and when it crashes it brings the whole computer with it making it slow and unresponsive. 
Reboot is the only way out. Decent FPS when it works though."
23269,this is a great game however there is still room for improvement. I hope in the future there will be more weapons and maps. This game game run on a basic computer as well!
23270,"Game is shit... Devs are liars,etc.
I hope that this game will shut down like did in Korea.
GG"
23271,"It's a good game. Only problem I have with it is the Battle Match says that it is a random map, yet, I have played the same damn map five matches in a damn row. But I do recomend the game. Its fun and the controls are easy.
UPDATE! NEW MAPS! WOOHOOOOO!!!!
Update 11/17/2017 
Somehow Black Squad unistalled itself from computer. pisses me off."
23272,"I love everything about this game. I also love how transparent Bryan and co have been about what's been going on in the process. The selection of weapons and game modes are pretty good! Though, some of the players are kinda..Odd.  Aside from that, it's all good! I highly recommend this game to people who like FPS games! 9/10!"
23273,"Basic shooter, really fun. Sniping is dumb easy and fun."
23274,"Maps suck. The movement isnt that great. Was easy to kill people, but not recommended."
23275,it's real fun. try it :3
23276,Be aware this is pretty much a CSGO and COD clone but it is pretty fun for a time waster casual free game. I will be interested to see how much th9is will be when it comes out but I would try it if you're looking for a casual free to play FPS.
23277,good game i love this game look like contur strike
23278,best free to play fps of 2017
23279,"I don't usually play FPS games, I just don't like them(I do have CSGO but didn't really enjoy it :3)  xd, but this one hooked me up idk why tho, i just feel like im doing something in this game not just running around getting killed with one bullet, but one thing is bad about it, KSG MUST GET NERF, anything else is just great maybe needs more weapons but overall just a great FPS F2P game :)"
23280,I downloaded the DLC but for some reason its not appearing and it says I bought it 12/31/1969???
23281,"OK, i've had enough of the game to do this review. IT'S GREAT!
pros:
-free to play
-great gameplay
-a lot of weapons that you can get with in-game money (you don't need a lot of money, that's good too)
-ALL weapons are good enough to go on a spree
-not pay2win
-developers listen to the community
And the coolest one so far: at the moment of me making this review, you can litteraly try all weapons by downloading FREE DLC. HOW COOL IS THAT???? (and it's early access too)
cons:
-some players are toxic
-small maps for deathmatch
-no sprint button"
23282,"This is in Early Access,so I will cut it some slack ^^ .

I put into this game 2 hours and I am already falling asleep.One BS thing,is the fact that your health doesn't regenerate.Wait what?I have seen myself COUNTLESS times into the less than 10 health mark,and all you can do is die in the next engagement.What about classes?Well,only 2 game modes allow them.But people mostly play TDM as always.I do not care about this game enough to go deeper into the gameplay.Last thing,the sprinting system is just bad IMO.But,you walk really fast anyway,so,I don’t use it cause you switch to your knife in order to run,so you can die if you meet an enemy by the time you get your weapon.

I know this is the kind of shooter like CS:GO,its the regular shooter with minimal recoil and kick so you can shoot from the hip while moving fast,but you can aim down your sights at least.Though,all you do is peek-a-boo or go in spraying and praying and double kill 2 enemies and have like 6 health remaining because netcode is bad and enemies are missing you 75% of the time.At other times,you die 2 seconds later and do small amounts of damage to an enemy. 

To be honest,these are not my biggest complains.The worse thing about this game..is the shooting itself...I know this is not Arma or anything,BUT,any kind of weapon you use,LMG,DMR,assault rifles and Sub-machine guns feels the SAME.I used the scar H DMR and it had a  20 round magazine and it was firing like an assault rifle,full automatic(where is the semi-automatic?What the heck?),it was laugable.If that is a DMR,then I don't know what the heck a DMR is,but whatever,its not meant to be realistic anyway.

But the sound when you hit an enemy?Wow,just wow,its like breaking someones bones infront of a mic,its unbeliavable,replace that sound effect immediately I had to turn it down cause it was too loud and annoying,plus,the sound for the ""man in the back"",saying the usual,""objective is nearly done"",is just mediocre,so,sound effects are mediocre at best,guns do not sound incredible either,and that ""tactical reload"" from you and your teammates?,hehe,you better be prepared to hear it 1000 times.

But last but not least,one of the most frustrating things about this game is...the maps.The maps are sometimes either a Great selection of...drum roll please...corridors.And small ones at that.Not only of course are the maps bland as always,I barely even remember their names(its a casual F2P FPS,what can you expect),but its just boring.

I remember at the map which is in a cruise or a ship,that you spawn and you either had:Corridor no.1,a narrow corridor where snipers would camp and kill anyone that went there,so,none of my teamates went there after they died 10 times.Then we have corridor no.2,and it begins after a starcase,and what basically happens is that,both teams stand the end of the corridor,shoot each other a bit,maybe move on when nobody is watching,which leads to an actual open area that is...just a point to access most of the corridors.WOW,amazing map design,then to move to the enemy base,there were ways to access corridor no.1,which would mean pure death,and then you had a small corridor at the north of the open area,which basically led to the enemy's base.At one point we were spawnkilling them,which is a bit alarming cause the map is just to damn small.

To be completely honest,most of the maps where just that,a set of corridors and an open area to give more ""freedom"" to the players.Yeah,I wish,after doing the same thing,in the same maps,in the same corridors?Yeah,tedious is the word to describe the gameplay.There is no ""different"" way to approach the enemy,just some high Points Of Interest thrown here and there,to give the advantage to people who are willing to go in the same spot,over and over,just because they can ambush people(I am reffering to that tower in the desert town,and a small bridge at an other map,which was like a plant or something).

I can asure you that the Batte match is far more interesting and its where the classes are available,you just have to wait more in comparison to TDM.Also,the maps are bigger(but corridor-ish again),but still better.Also the regular TDM is 8VS8 while this is 16VS16,so go out there and kill each other.

Anyway,to address the “other” portions of a game,I can say that,the Free “DLC” was a good move,cause it gave you a good amount of pretty much all types of weapons,for unfortunately 15 Days,but whatever,positive about that(We will see if that was only for early access).The prices of the  weapons,while a bit high,are actually obtainable,something like 120K+(or even lower),is an OK amount,cause you start anyway with 200K+,and,you get something like 1K and lower “gold” per game,and,you get 15K per day if you login.There are the usual crates,which need premium currency to open(bullets they call them),apart from a 30K gold one that gives you melee weapons and grenades,so,a no for me.

So F2P players?This looks OK,we will see how this will change in the near future.Apart from that,that’s all for now,graphics are OK for the regular potato PC,not amazing,runs smooth.Tutorial was just bad...tried way too hard to get you into the “hell yeah war is badass” mood or whatever.UI needs some tweaking here and there.Servers were unstable,once online and once offline,but this is launch so its OK,now it seems more stable.

So overall,is this CS:GO:poor man's edition?Yes,I would say,if you are into this kind of games,try it,go ahead,but just be prepared to feel the small amount of content.Personally?I would go play dirty bomb,neither is that game great but I find it more interesting and appealing than this.

But one thing I can say,is,that this was one of the “better” experiences with F2P shooters,I played far worse shooters and this was much better,so I am happy about that,if they fix the issues and add more content this will sure be a shooter to play.Wait and see,wait and see.

Maybe this was really good for some,but for me,its was mediocre at best,but hey,the best things are the simple ones.I simply cannot recommend this to someone apart from the fast paced competitive shooter fans,so it's a 5/10 for me."
23283,"Good ass F2P game. The netcode is great, very well optimized, and honestly im enjoying it more than I did CSGO. Not P2W it seems, but game is early access so much to come"
23284,"I play this game for 2 hours and just I can say that's a realy cool game!have lot of fun on that!the weapons,maps,everything is good but it needs more and better!I hope that the future game is good!"
23285,"this is now my top 5 favourite games ive played. its so much fun, great style of play. i would love to see how much health the player has after he has killed me tho that would be a good update...
"
23286,"A nice game of hand-only Play values ​​need some improvements:

1 . fix c4 plant glitch in some map . 
2. Add voice chat! . 
3 - Servers in more places in Singapore and the Middle East! . 
4. Develop a 5vs5 Comptitive Mod  with prizes for the game's own money or Pack !

..."
23287,GOOD
23288,"I had my doubts about this game, but once you start playing you start to wonder how it's a free to play game."
23289,10/10
23290,Dumb fun FPS. Not bad at all.
23291,"There is no appeal, its a copy of COD and CSGO, the guns are all unbalanced, the maps are all small and disapointing, the only good thing about the game is that you can unlock everything without paying. Also the game crashes almost everytime you try to change a setting or do something other than play"
23292,not too bad of a game very low quailty graphics even on ultra but if you like the call of duty franchise then this is your cup of tea but otherwise would  not recomend
23293,Pretty funny
23294,"This game has all the makings of the best free FPS game on the market.. The guns are great, the cash shop is full of mostly cosmetic upgrades, and all items you can recieve by just playing the game and earning them, and the gameplay is engaging and fun. The maps are a bit small, but even so, don't take a whole lot away from the frantic deathmatch style experience. Why then, am I giving this game a negative review? Well, to put it simply.. Hacking in this game is rampant, and battleye doesn't seem to be catching even the most obvious ones. Until this has changed, I cannot recommend this game to anyone.

EDIT: After looking further into the issue, it does seem that the devs are working hard to get rid of the current flaw in the anti-cheat that is allowing this flood of hackers into their game, and seem to be confident that it will be resolved soon. The game itself is very fun, and quite well made. If the hacker issues are sorted it will surely be one of the better free FPS games on the market. All in all, my review has been changed to recommended, as it is afterall a free game, and quite worth you making your own decision on wether or not the hackers are as huge an issue for you as they are for me."
23295,"Not a bad game
Very similar to AVA/COD 

PROS: 
-Satisfying to kill since it is so easy for one to die
-Very optimized for an early access game
-Simplistic gameplay which feels smooth just to spend time and calm down on
-Access to guns early on

CONS:
-Somewhat unbalanced at the moment (KSG shotgun)
-NADE PHYSICS are rather poor compared to games such as csgo
-Mediocre soundtrack

"
23296,For sure the best f2p shooter out there!!!
23297,"Pretty good. Just a tip though... don't spend all your gold you get at the start on sh*tty guns like I did...make sure the guns you get are good. You should probably just go all out and spend your gold on one really good gun. Even if you spend your starter gold on crap like I did, you can still make it back. You make at least 15K gold every single day because of the daily rewards. It's a pretty good game and there is no paying for anything. But a problem is that the desert eagle is way underpowered. It's a desert eagle, it should kill someone in one shot. It's pretty unrealistic that it doesn't. And the community sucks... half the people who play just act like autistic pr*cks all the time. They always type into team chat ""lol he died"" or ""nub"" or something along those lines just because that was the last person to die. And many times the last person to die is carrying the team, so the dude just saying ""lol he sucks"" is literally talking about the person carrying his team while he is doing absolute sh*t. It gets very annoying after a while..."
23298,"It needs some changes, like you can shoot and run with too many weapons.. and other balance changes like that but ye. Not bad, not bad."
23299,It is a good game....
23300,CSGO with ads and hitscan #lul
23301,"I never liked a f2p shooter so much! 

Definetly [h1] the best [/h1] free shooter out there at the moment"
23302,just to start this game is really under rated people compain to much about nothing. for a free to play early acces game this is really good yeh it is not perfect but it is a lot of fun. Playing with friends is a blast and you just can't stop playing. I don't have a lot of hours in this game but I think I won't stop playing this game for a while. I really reccomend getting this game and it's free so why not plus almost everyone can run the game so you can play with all your friends. and the best thing is that it isn't pay 2 win.
23303,So good game! i like it
23304,"Soon to be a Free-to-Play | Pay-To-Win game, the grind is too much"
23305,8/8 would play again. Im gonna go pro in this game. im pretty good
23306,csgo 3/4/5/76/idk
23307,"I wanted to stream this game, but obs cant pick it up. every other game works but not this i'm not sure if its because it's 32bit. but ive tried switching the 32bit obs and no joy. If anyone can help let me know. I done the tutorial and i want to do more but on stream."
23308,"Great game and was shocked for a f2p game. Its pretty solid and looks polished and finished despite being early access

Pros. 
Addictive gunplay
Easy to learn and jump right in,
No p2w items and good weapon balance for a ea game. (Minus the shotguns they are op as f**k)


The negatives are what you expect  from early access games.

Lots of maintenance and down time 
A few netcode bugs leading to hit regs being missed at times.
Weapons still need fine tuning grenades, snipers and shotguns seem op or too easy to use.

Definitely worth a look at. Probably the best f2p shooter ive found since 2003
"
23309,Have an Asia server and i will play it everyday
23310,very nice
23311,Not sure if the servers are down right now but overal this is a very unique game other than some items and bits of gameplay are based on other said games. I also really enjoyed the mechanics. It's in good standing as a f2p early access shooter.
23312,it only allowed me to do the tutorial and then i could not play any thing else. the game itself is a pay to win. it does not explain how to play or get around the menus very easily it is up tot the player to figure out.
23313,"I saw i downloaded i played and to show support to the DEVS i  bought Founders Pack and some gun boxes to help the team!

Pros:Free to play
         Many different guns
         You dont need to buy new guns in order to win

Cons:Now and then i get lag spikes wich almost always result in me being owned
         Could use new bigger maps
         Spawnraping is an issue but i think its cause game is new so none of us a really skilled so its easy to get trough(or cause of small maps idk)
         No ranked games only clan war(for me personally its not a problem casue i love this game :D )
         NO AK 47 or COLT COMMANDO(CMON DEVS ^_^ PLEASE!!!!1) ofc IRON SIGHTS ONLY :D 

This game is worth your time and if u like FPS try it out!!

23314,"Game was good before they stop making weekly updates. I don`t recommend play the game now because they only adding new creates/skins and 1 weapon( + First Release DLC and they said first release dlcs won`t last long on the market but AXMC dlc still there :d  ) and thats it. Also every time they making excuse to make discount and begging players to buy Bullets -_-

UPDATE 18 September: And there`s also have hackers now : - |"
23315,"As an NA player, going against player with 200-300 ping is complete bullshit and at times feels almost unplayable. I dont understand why the devs let EU and Asian players with over 300 ping into NA servers. This game is mediocre at best and if you want the same experience just go play CSGO until the netcode issues are resolved. 
The game has a very good foundation for a fun competitve shooter or for someone looking for a fun, casual FPS game. But for now i could not reccomend playing the game until the networking issues are worked out."
23316,best game duhh
23317,actuly its a very nice game with nice config and weps but some weps got time limit but still for an early access game its a nice and prrety awsome f2p game
23318,"Bad gameplay, bad weapon balance, headshot with shotguns from miles and low damage with rifles. Ah and is full of cheaters, beware this shitty game."
23319,Best camper fiesta i ever played 10/10
23320,听说是  开发CF的公司开发的，这么多年就弄了这么个玩意，射击感确实和CF相似。服务器无敌的烂，如果三年前玩玩还行，这都2017年了。
23321,"So i rarely write reviews but i thought to myself that i actually needed to write this one. (TL;DR Below aswell as Pros and Cons).

So i don't want to overdo this review and write about small unecessary details that could be easily fixed, yes this game is in it's early stages so i can't expect everything to be 100 percent. But this game actually managed to caught my attention, not only is the game fun and fast paced but it's tactical. You don't heal overtime so you actually have to think about your next move and think about how much health your teammates got which i do like a lot since it increases the difficulity to a really nice level beetween casual and hardcore.  Didn't take to long to get into this game either since it's quite easy as in the aspect of anyone can play it but only few can become really good at it, something else i think is good in this game is that you actually get to customize your weapon in game with a silencer and laser if you want that, equiping these accessories both has it's advantages and disadvantages.

All around just a great game and to make it shorter some pros and cons

Pros:
Dosen't require a beast pc
Easy to learn
You can buy permanent weapons instead of renting them like in other games
Settings for everything
Good Maps

Cons:
Some glitches/bugs 
Few servers with decent ping
Few weapons to choose from
Few gamemodes to choose from

TL;DR
It's a game, for free... that's actually good. 
"
23322,AMAZING
23323,shotguns are op and it's like cod 4 with all the grenades that are being thrown across the map.
23324,It was good until it got a river of hackers. Not more new content just new Skins.
23325,"This game is soooo bad. Spawn camping to horrible latency is the main issues. Lack of real classes, no more than 3 weapons to start with, etc. Not worth playing if you already play cod, battlefield, or any other triple a fps. If your new expect to be killed and killed and killed until either a you slowly grind your way to a good gun or pay real money for one....sigh."
23326,too many brs ;/
23327,its fun and fast pace but unfortunately the lag pike make the game unbearable to play.
23328,"This is just a slightly better Combat Arms clone where did ""best f2p shooter"" come from?

if you want a free shooter that also runs on UE3 play Blacklight."
23329,"Firstly I'd like to say that this it isn't a terrible game and it isn't an amazing game either. When I first had a look at the trailers and previews, I really like the visuals and the concepts however when I first got ingame it was nothing compared to what I had initially thought it would be like. I still loved the graphics but I feel it didn't meet nor exceed my expectations. I was hoping for something different, something new but all I got was boring gameplay. When I loaded into the home screen I instantly HATED the monetary system. By the fact that you have to buy guns that you don't own permenantly really ticks me off. I don't want to have to grind day in and day out just to get the best guns. Secondly, there is nothing special about the game. I know it is still in early access but I feel like they are trying to sap hours out of my time where I can invest it into something more well developed. This is basically that other game ""Line of Sight"". It's just too similar and too boring for my taste. Lastly, a smaller detail that I'm sure all FPS gamers look for. When firing a weapon, I want that loud and realistic kick that the guns in other games produce. I don't want a wimpy little crack, I want a firm, sharp shot although this is only a miniscule detail. Overall, I love how it's free and looks great for an early access game but it seems like a copy off other games and doesn't introduce any new or interesting concepts. For that I don't recommend the game but I hope to see improvements in the near future that I hope to catch my attention."
23330,its like CSGO but horrible graphics very low fps even with a good pc do not get
23331,[h1]TAC RELOAD[/h1]
23332,"Although it's Early Access and it's free to play the game has good shooter mechanics.
As a CS player, I enjoyed my time playing this game.
The game has really good hitreg and there are little to no lag spikes, ever. Server quality = <3
as far as gameplay goes, it's just like your average F2P shooter, but you don't really have to worry about guns being too op or being too crap. It all feels balanced (except maybe shotguns, but it's still early access so its reasonable to start the shotgun at this pace).

7/10

only a 7 'cause it's not a finished game"
23333,"They are advertising with battleye cheat protection.
Battleye isn't implemented.
No cheat protection at all. Cheaters in any Lobby. 
Do not support such a company. 

UPDATE:
-Battleye is now working, but still not properly. At least one obvious cheater in every Lobby.
-still no ping autokick. Ping abusing in every lobby. 16 People playing, at least 10 with ping above 200, killing everyone while not being hitable.
-Hit detection is aweful at all.. It's the same fuck like in Line of Sight and other f2p shooters.
-only one overall mouse sensitivity setting. Sensitivity whil run an gun is the same as when you aim down the sight.
-skin drop rate in random loot boxes is unreasonable. It's even that low, that you can call this company just criminal.

Do not support them."
23334,Seems good but it isn't. It's mostly get a gun and spray. Aim and skill are not rewarded.
23335,fucking garbage
23336,"Really fun, like a PC COD except this one has more than 1000 a day and inst bad"
23337,"Shit game, Bad graphics andVery Bad gameplaying"
23338,No proper anticheat. Skins can easily reach 400euros.
23339,"Aside from the Mods & Devs being very patient and interactively active to all the players and supporters. This game definitely differs from other FPS games. Given it being a F2P FPS, this game DEFINITELY is not a P2W unlike other games as all guns are acquirable by in-game currency. Though there is a cash shop (bullet currency), but it's mostly for skins which doesn't affect gameplays.

My ""wants"" for this game would be the availability of changing or adjusting different types of scopes in guns.

 Considering it is still in its early Alpha stages, there's very little kinks that needs to be ironed out IN MY OPINION. Which are:

Hoping that ""QUICKPLAY"" will use the regular rooms that's created by players rather than having its own separate room because it will cut all players in half. Just like Warface, the regular rooms created by players are always empty because all other players are in the quickplay rooms. Hoping it would be the same or close to Combat Arms UI/Room Finder.

KSG (Shotgun)- Needs to be nerfed as it is definitely OP! Can dominate all other guns at close-to-mid range.

Limited players 4-man team in all modes while Demolition/PTB can be 4-man or 5-man; although, there is a 8v8 game.

Head hitbox could be a little smaller, IMO it's way too big, easy HS.

Majority of the AR (Assault Rifles) have MASSIVE recoil and spread. Learn how to tap or gg.

Switching between weapons is SO SLOW. Specially for snipers, no chance in survivng at close range unless you can HS your enemy with pistol in 3 shots - Headshots with pistol does 37 damage with default.

-----------------------------------
UPDATE: 19 October 2017

This game is now filled with crouch spammers that are using auto shoot upon crouch or auto crouch upon shooting or vice versa. NA servers are littered with AS/SEA players that takes advantage of the lag/ping difference. Not that it makes a lot of difference, but when they also use a macro? That's just freaking terrific.... Until this is resolve, I will leave it with a thumbs down."
23340,we need Asia server
23341,"Boring, generic shooter. These are the words that perfectly describe this free-to-play shooter.

This game has no depth to it other than walking and shooting, it doesn't try to do anything new or interesting. It plays it safe by having semi-acceptable netcode, little to no recoil and accuracy loss, basic maps (one of which comes straight from alliance of valiant arms), and a cash-shop system that I am fond of seeing not currently filled with extremely expensive guns that take either your wallet to get or 300 hours.

It's an alright-ish multiplayer shooter, but it gets old faster than the time it takes to download it.

The graphics are kind of passable, but with the unreal engine 3 it's not that hard. It looks like something out of 2010. I will commend that the game runs perfectly with zero stuttering or frame drops on it's maximum settings. Besides that it's not a great looking game.

Overall, if you've played any classic free-to-play multiplayer shooter around 2010 or beyond and you see this game, skip it. It's nothing that will blow you away or be interesting long enough to justify wasting your time downloading and playing it. You'll likely get a kick out of it for a few hours and simply leave it installed collecting dust on your drive, or quickly uninstall it and forget it existed.

The developers can still make this game into something more than a stiff, poor mans cs:go clone, but will they? We'll find out in a year or so. Right now it's a rinse and repeat shooter that's duller than the knives in my grandmothers kitchen.

23342,"GREAT GAME
JUST KIDDING...UNISTALL AND RETURN BACK TO WARFACE !!!"
23343,Best Free 2 Play So Far Great Job Dev 10/10
23344,Fun but definately not competetive or skill based
23345,"0% pay2win. game has balancing issues and annoying RNG spray patterns for certain assault rifles, but it def has potential. devs added a ping limit of 200 i believe and have introduced a steam market and competitive (non-clan) mode like players asked for."
23346,"This game is honestly pretty bad. I'd only play it if I had a low-end laptop and no other options. Otherwise I can't recommend it. The maps are very tiny and you can't even change gun attachments, which includes not being able to remove the sights on guns."
23347,Very cool game with huge potential! Luv it!
23348,"so damn horrible, movement is bad, graphics shit, no simple weapon customization, and rthe interface menu...damn thats sad, big no!"
23349,"The game is finally out in Early Access! I have been waiting for weeks upon weeks to finally review this game after my 2 experinces with the Closed Beta's


[h1] Gameplay	[/h1]
The game runs super decent on low end PC's including the potatoe PC's. This is also such a simple game. I find it very enjoyable for how simple the gameplay is. Now onto my favourite part, THE FREE DLC. I know that the DLC later on will not be free and will be priced! But that doesn't explain how nice they were to release two EA DLC's that allow us to enjoy the game with EVERY GUN. (Not the ones in Supply Crates).

I recommend the game to everyone. DOWNLOAD IT NOW

"
23350,meh
23351,"Why can't i recommend the game even if it makes alot of fun ? Hackers. They are currently in all bigger lobbys completly ruining the fun. But they are not your usual type of looser kid running around with rage settings killing everybody. Nope, they are running around with modified damage to destroy enemy crates withing seconds. This makes a 15 Minute game last 2 minutes. I hope this will be adressed soon, otherwise i don't see a bright future for this.

Edit : So far no hackers since the latest patches, game runs smooth, only thing that concerns me is that SMG'S somewhat need a whole ammoclip to kill somebody."
23352,Got into a game after waiting forever and get spawned camped by cheaters. Left that game and tried again same thing so I really don't recommend this game.
23353,"If you are looking for a simple shooter to kill some time with you won't go wrong here.  Though it does need a little more work in terms of balance and mode design.

On the upside, it runs well, plays well, and if you aren't killed by a blazer [strike]or KSG [/strike], I never felt at any time I died due to some kind of unfair element. The base game is just good, clean, simple Arcade-FPS fun.

The biggest downside to me so far is balance. There are some OP guns ([strike]KSG is worse than the akimbo 1887s back in Modern Warfare 2[/strike] [b] WAS OP, you can still die fast to it but it's nowhere near as bad as it once was[/b], and to a much lesser extent, blazer) and some rather underpowered abilities (Seriously who uses The Medkits or ammo restore abilities? And I havent seen juggernaut armor used once because of how stupid expensive it is)

The game modes are....mixed. Demolition is basically Counter Strike or COD Search and Destroy, though not as graceful as either. TDM is Probably the most fun IMHO, just good clean simple shootin fun.

The two unique modes however require a bit more to talk about

VIP: Good in theory, needs work in practice. Like in Demolition, there are zero respawns, one team is trying to prevent another team from getting into a room where once they enter it an Executive looking guy in a purple suit appears, after downing several rifle rounds in this guy, he goes down and the attacker survivors need to run back to spawn to get to a helicopter. 

The big problem here is that it's hillariously lopsided in favor of the defenders. Three things typically happen.

1) The Attackers never make it because everyone dies

2)The Attackers make it, but the defender's superior defensive positions allow them to get the jump on them as they are attacking the VIP

3) The Attackers kill the VIP cause someone slid right through, but they gotta go ALL the  way back to spawn....and the other team knows, since the VIP is on one side of the map and the spawn on the other, since the defenders are nearer to the the helipad, they go and camp it, and because they..again have superior defensive positions around the helicopter, they kill the oncoming attackers one by one

I have never won as attackers or lost as defenders, though it is possible for the attackers to win, most likely by killing everyone else

Finally there's the Battle mode, which is their unique mode. it's a mode where you have to destroy five armored crates (or do as much damage as you can before time runs out) before the other team destroys yours. Whoever does the most damage or destroys the other team's crates win. In this mode you get access to classes which give you a passive bonus and Black-ops 2 Style Killstreaks

It's not bad, it's actually a lot of fun once you get your head around how to avoid the sniper killzones, but some abilities could use a buff or redesign...and maybe give smokes as an ability for attacking snipers in horrid spots (more on this later)

Off the top of my head: [strike] The Grenade launchers suck, and are only useful at short-mid range taking targets out around corners [/strike] [b]NOPE! They are useful! Just situtational [/b], Nobody uses health/Ammo packs (ESPECIALLY AMMO PACKS), and Juggernaut is too expensive

Netcode is fine if your connection is fine, if it starts to die on you then the game starts to die on you

The F2P Model isn't bad, but it's not perfect. It is by no means Pay2Win, as advertised, The guns you start out with are servicable enough and you can fight back with them (Unless of course you come across a well entrenched Blazer sniper or a KSG runner...but you can easily get those for free early in the game). 

You spend money on ""Bullets"" which give you access to Counter strike style loot crates...and that's pretty much it! Everything else you get more or less through grinding (and you get enough money to buy 2-3 guns at the start...depending on what you pick of course)

My only complaint with the model so far is the timed grenades...not only are they relativley expensive in relation to the amount of gold you get per game, but they also only last for a DAY. This is only a problem with Smoke Grenades. Smokes are sometimes your ONLY option against a well entrenched sniper, and you can very much run into a situation in Battle where you have none, BECAUSE of those restrictions! Flash or frags are nice force multipliers, but you can live without them so I don't have a problem with those being timed. Maybe there can be a weak smoke or a visual screen to replace a less-used ability to ablate this?

Like I said, if you are looking for a simple Arcade-y FPS, you wont go wrong here. I enjoyed my time so far, despite issues.

Other than that, my only other request is that I think it could be cool to have class-variants of the existing modes..."
23354,"Sucked ass. horrible ""AI"". graphics were decent though. idk wtf they were thinking putting the sprint button as the mouse wheel. otherwise 3/10"
23355,"It's so hard, I feel like I haven't joined a balanced game since I started playing. But it's early access so play it anyway"
23356,"This game is fun for a free First Person Shooter, I can't wait for it to get more content. 

7 Tac Reloads out of 10"
23357,"Don't try this game at all until it gets balanced. Practically every gun one shots if you get a headshot or a if you have a gun that can kill upper body or higher. The movement is awful and everyone pretty much spams crouch while swaying side to side very quick (not like CSGO, it's that bad) the disadvantage is you need high sensitivity (yes you need it plainly becuase rn no one has knowledge of the maps and someone can sneak up from the side easily.) When you get into a new game you have 3 designed sets for melee, weapons, and items like smokes. Once you've customized the sets, in game you can't switch them and you cant buy specific items such as if you need a smoke and flash grenade to save your life while instead, for example, you are equiping a explosive grenade with a smoke. Finally, this game can make you rage very quickly."
23358,its a good game ....its free and it has everything a small game should have ...
23359,just buy a real game... smh
23360,"this game is amazing and wayyyyyyy better than freaking CSGO!! 
i just wish they would make the team deathmatch maps bigger. thay are wayyy to small"
23361,terrible
23362,"I don't recommend this game, It's the same as any other f2p, It feels more like combat arms"
23363,Nice Game I Like it !
23364,"Why is it overly complicated to even join a game, i literelly never see anything to click play or nothing. good thing it was free or id want a refund"
23365,"Actually good f2p fps, but I have a game breaking glitch where my mouse is frozen at the top left of the screen, so i cant navigate the menus.  Please fix. Edit: the bug fixed itself and now i can play."
23366,"90% of players on the EU server (I'm from the UK) have a ping of 250-350+ I have a ping of 38. It can't be that 90% of the EU players have terrible internet so I'm putting it down to the game.

You can pretty much buy the most OP guns in the game as soon as you start. The Blazer 1 shots pretty much 99% of the time and the KSG is literally a shotgun sniper rifle.

The guns are WAY too accurate, even while moving with a sniper rifle the bullets go perfectly straight meaning most of my games are 30+ kills and 5 or less deaths seeing as the Blazer Rifle is OP, it's really stupid. Strafe speed is ridiculous, this is meant to be a military shooter, not Quake.

I'd personally stay clear of this game, the ping of everyone is horrible and the gun play is really really lack lustered and boring, it's too straight forward, point gun (no matter if you're standing, crouching, moving, jumping) and your bullets will go where you're aiming and basically have ZERO recoil.

I don't leave reviews for games but this game needs some serious work, I've heard you listen to your fans and player base, which is great, please consider some of the things people have said because I'm not the only one who thinks similar to what I've mentioned.
"
23367,GARBAGE
23368,"If it continues to be FTP, 10/10. I wouldn't pay for the game outright, but I'll DEFINITELY log some serious hours if it continues to be free."
23369,"another shitty f2p pay 2 win bullshit shooter.
fuck this game"
23370,"As some who plays a ton of different FPS games. This is by far one of the best shooters I have ever played. Everygood is very good and no gun is over powered compaired to the other. 200k is given for free when you start and for that helps you start off with a game where you can but do not have to purchase anything (like warframe, grind is there). One of the best shooters reminds me of a Cod/CS Go.  Would give it 5/5 but onl;y 4/5 due to some of the ingame purchases I feel like nades and smokes should always be avaliable for all.

4/5"
23371,"Brainless fun, like Call of Duty. Some guns need balance changes (mostly damage checks). The maps I've played so far are the bane of my existence, but I didnt download expecting much. Play if you want to kill time."
23372,"GG, players models should be smaller so it's harder to hit them. 

Snipers are crazy OP

Some re-skined CSGO maps would be nice in 5v5

5v5 needs voice chat"
23373,"this game has so much potential, but the game has 2001 netcode and the hit detection is really bad. The shotguns are horribly unbalanced. Nerf the shotguns, fix hit detection, and this will be the best fps in my and many others' libraries"
23374,Cod mashed with cs go
23375,"DESCRIPTION: A mix of America's Army (graphics, models, animation, and VIP mode); COD4 (speed, game style, perks) and CSGO (bomb game mode). Fast paced, arcadish, close quarters maps.

GOOD:
- Easy to play and understand, straightfoward mechanics.
- Not P2W. You can use the free virtual currency to buy any 2 weapons from the very beggining (even the one you consider to be the best).
- 15 days trial of all weapons (useful to spend the starting bonus).
- Still no hackers.
- Lot of weapons.
- Good servers, low ping.
- Real currency shop with ""cosmetic"" items (not affect the real ability on game).
- Low system requirements.

BAD:
- Very VERY small Deathmatch maps, even smaller than COD4. Not really well constructed. (no DM maps are fine).
- Graphics may looks ""Old"" for some people (Unreal Engine 3).
- Just one free model for your soldier, everybody looks the same!
- Right now, the current player base is unexperienced. It is easy to climb to 1st place from very beggining if you know other FPS (example: America's, CS, or COD4). Ah, and you may be called ""cheater"" or ""hacker""."
23376,"The game itself is alright for a f2p. It's your generic fps with nothing unique about it. The community is already toxic, the guns are not yet balanced so everybody uses the same overpowered gun (currently ksg). I was very excited for this and played in both closed betas. In the end the expierence wasn't what i was hoping for. Hopefully time will prove me wrong, but at this point this is just another generic fps that will die out after the newness wears off. But it's free so I'd say give it a try and see what you think."
23377,"Great game to play if u play it everyday becoming a hardcore player but if you stop playing the game for a while theres no coming back many player invest so many time in this game wich there fatass stay there more then 5 hour of gameplay everyday wich they dont do anything in life but just gaming 
i used to play this game everyday during the vacation, but now i have studies to do so if u are like me used to be good and trying to get that skill back, just dont play it until you can find time to play this game almost everyday but seriously there other game that are better than this so dont waste all of your time on this game if u cant be good enough!!
"
23378,Csgo but without the suck.
23379,decent
23380,why can't there be a white and asian squad huh?
23381,very terrible game
23382,"its just your basic F2P chinese FPS that steam keeps accepting and are all the same i cant recommed this game to anyone its unblanced and just a shitshow

if you want a good F2P FPS get Crossfire its not on steam but its been going for so many years and the community is still growing."
23383,better then most games... (y)
23384,"The game needs some changes onto some stuff... but.. it's still pretty good, playing this is quite fun tbh"
23385,"This is the best F2P FPS game out right now, and possibly ever. It feels superior to Warface and Blacklight Retribution, and is clearly better than games like Alliance of Valient Arms or Crossfire. 

The graphics are very decent and run buttery smooth on nearly any machine. If you can run windows, you can run this game. 

Hands down the best feature in-game is the grind for weapons, by that i mean that currently, all guns can be grinded for by playing matches (granting Gold) and leveling up (granting metals and other cool rewards). There are currently no weapons that are overpowered and are behind a paywall. 

On the topic of overpowered, there are, as with all games, some balance issues. The Blazer (sniper) and KSG (shotgun) are clearly overpowered.  Some assault rifles are lackluster and SMGs are far weaker than Assault Rifles. Not to mention Grenade Launchers on certain maps sometimes give an unfair advantage and on others they are absolutely terrible. 

The developers have been consistent about listening to community feedback and it really seems like they want this game to grow, so please support if you can. 

TL;DR: Non-pay to win good feeling and looking Free FPS. Get it!

23386,It's a mix between COD and CSGO that hits all the right points.  Played with the GM of the company that runs this game and he was a cool guy :)

23391,"This is a great game, what it needs is its own signiture game mode, mabey something like a fight on trains, or vehicals, to reach a pont before the enemy, that would be so fun, if that was made, best steam game i own."
23392,wouldnt be a bad game if an thier was an AUSTRALIA SERVER
23393,"The game speed is way to fast. DLC's (which give you free guns, but you only get to use them for a limited ammount of time) are the only way to actually have a good time in the game or else you get destroyed by overpowered rifles. Maps are WAYYYYYY TO SMALL. As a CS, Overwatch, and BF player, I am hugely dissaopinted in the lack of options in the map, and ability to choose where you want to go, essentially once one team gains control it's over, because nade spam and locking down a choke point essentially makes it a lost game. I was killed multiple times within 10 seconds of spawning from nades because the engagements are WAYYY to close to the spawns for this kind of gameplay. 


A friend reccommended it to me, and i uninstalled in under 30 minutes. Now I like fast paced games like Overwatch, Dirty bomb, and others, but the time to kill was ridiculous, I was being heashotted before i even had time to turn the corner in one maps spawn. its actually so broken it was disgusting. Nothing is balanced, rifles and shotguns are overly broken to where its not even laughable. lack of options off the bat for people who like to use snipers was off-putting because any FPS that wants to be decently rated should not have a semi auto sniper that has less effectiveness than a shotgun from over 30 feet. The game needs to be fixed and fine tuned before ill touch it again. I would never touch this game again if I had to pay for it while it's in this state. 

HOWEVER- it does have room for improvement, and could ""possibly"" become a somewhat decent title as FTP game. But again DLC's with time restriced use on guns is not ok.

nuff said.

plz fix.

EDIT [05.11.17]: I will try it one more time, maybe it's better now.
After getting a full enemy team of cheaters I decided to delete the game"
23407,"Game is about 10 years to late nothing but a cheesey call of duty knock off. So if your a COD fan, have fun with its ugly step sister. Alot of non english speaking players with outrageous ping on north american servers"
23408,hackers
23409,"The game mixes up CS with COD a bit and does a good job doing this.

Don't really like the 'you need to buy guns with ingame/cash currency'-thing but it is not really pay2win as it does not take long to unlock things. But I don't get why they won't skip that aspect completly then and only charge money by offering skins. You could do this with the steam market integration and would make tons of money with that. It has a bad taste on it when you are able to buy gameplay relevant features out of the matches themself. Even tho I don't think it's a problem I still think there could have been a better way to do this. And that might be arguing on a high level but I say this because the gameplay is really good and the game could be even better.
But well, I just wanted to say that you really make not fault by trying that game. It's free anyway. 
So go, get it!"
23410,"Well i had trouble starting it after fixing that went and tried it out found out quick ksg is fucking stupidly op got a head shot kill from over 20 meters then the hit boxes are garbage honestly the whole time of me playing im just saying ""what even is this game"" needs a lot of work but could be ok also its that game that says ""hey you can get this gun for X amount of days or you can spend more to unlock it forever"" yet they give you so much to just unlock like 3 or 4 guns forever so im just so confused about this game.

TL:DR i think playing OG team fortress while having a stroke is pretty much the same"
23411,Really good game
23412,Great game if all you want to do is play a tutorial.
23413,Reminds me of artic combat!Love it!
23414,dont like
23415,"Pros: 
Quick download 

Cons: 
Full of hackers
Dreadful hitbox
Gun damage is un-balanced

Other than game-breaking cons, it's okay (in other words, don't bother playing this.)"
23416,"Boring, generic shooter. These are the words that perfectly describe this free-to-play shooter.

This game has no depth to it other than walking and shooting, it doesn't try to do anything new or interesting. It plays it safe by having semi-acceptable netcode, little to no recoil and accuracy loss, basic maps (one of which comes straight from alliance of valiant arms), and a cash-shop system that I am fond of seeing not currently filled with extremely expensive guns that take either your wallet to get or 300 hours.

It's an alright-ish multiplayer shooter, but it gets old faster than the time it takes to download it.

The graphics are kind of passable, but with the unreal engine 3 it's not that hard. It looks like something out of 2010. I will commend that the game runs perfectly with zero stuttering or frame drops on it's maximum settings. Besides that it's not a great looking game.

Overall, if you've played any classic free-to-play multiplayer shooter around 2010 or beyond and you see this game, skip it. It's nothing that will blow you away or be interesting long enough to justify wasting your time downloading and playing it. You'll likely get a kick out of it for a few hours and simply leave it installed collecting dust on your drive, or quickly uninstall it and forget it existed.

The developers can still make this game into something more than a stiff, poor mans cs:go clone, but will they? We'll find out in a year or so. Right now it's a rinse and repeat shooter that's duller than the knives in my grandmothers kitchen."
23417,dat $tick
23418,"Very very very buggy and things need to balanced, Not to mention the past 2 days we have 7 maintenances.... 
However the game when playable (Not during maintenance) is really fun!

Mix between CSGO and COD it's the best"
23419,"Just another free-to-play FPS out there. I don't see much in this game. 

[h1][b]0.5/4"
23420,"Pretty decent game. Also the free EA DLC is a great start for a beta! The crates are just for skins not stats which I really like. I can already tell their are legit hackers in this game that are pretty damn good at it! But, that is rare as of now. I haven't played much but this game is pretty good. I am just using a 1.8ghz dual core, 8gb ram (custom on board gpu drivers for intel) Windows 10 Pro 64bit. I pull an average of 50fps on medium settings, on low 1366x768 game still looks good and i get about 60-100fps."
23421,"Actually the game is under server maintenance every time, it can't play a complet match"

Until the server get a perm fix i will not change my review"
23423,"-Starts game
-Does Tutorial
-Ok
-Sees in-game money
-200k ok i guess guns are 400k-600k
-Guns 80k-192k
-WAT!?
-Buys 2 super good guns who already have everything on them (scope,grenade launcher)
-Didnt have to play the game to get good guns have them already at lvl 1
-Still have 30K left 
-Everyday by just playing 15k in-game money
-Ok
-Easy 10/10



After checking♥♥♥♥♥♥out i can assure u EVERYTHING AND I MEAN EVERYTHING 
""cough"" except skins ""cough"" CAN BE BOUGHT WHIT IN-GAME Money

Edit:After testing out all guns i can say that 75% of the assault rifles have huge as recoil and spread especaily the hk417 that gun should have the smallest recoild and spread but for some reason it has the biggest i wish they would lower the recoil and spread on guns for me its unplayable i use like 1 assault rifel the scar-h and the 2 shotguns because i cant use the other rifels and the snipers are ok nothing to change 
After playing Csgo,overwatch,warface,sf2 for
csgo playtime:380H
overwatch:100H
warface:400+H
sf2.400+H
i can safely say that this game has the bigest recoil and spread on guns so far

23424,Best FPS 10/10.
23425,"Decent FPS with CS like controls and quite balanced gameplay. I will be getting a founders pack soon and supporting the developers.
"
23426,better than csgo.. less stress more fun
23427,"Shotgun is really op. 100% kill with one shot.
But I liked it."
23428,"Main menu is so bugged that you can't even play. Sometimes the aim doesn't work. Sometimes you die for strange reasons.

Launcher is bugged, game is bugged.

Unplayable."
23429,Shotgun range seriously needs too be nerfed badly i should not get killed by a 12gauge at 30 ft sorry its not real nerf them
23430,this is a game where u run and shoot peopel if u into csgo or  cod u should get it best part is its free
23431,good game for a quick shooter fix. probably wont dump a lot of time on it but its a fun way to kill an hour here and there.
23432,very fun and addicting! If ur looking for a Call Of Duty like FPS this game is for you! AND ITS FREE :)
23433,it wouldnt even start
23434,The game wouldn't even start via launcher and devs aren't giving a crap about my tickets that I send in which they still aren't responded or solved yet.

23438,"somebody know what the reedem free packege is 
"
23439,"A GOOD GAME DESERVES THE BEST CRITICS

The game has improved compared to the events. But the developer has been lacking in the gameplay settings for the competitive ones (I hope he doesn't abandon it), the BS flows very well in 16 vs 16 TDM war modes and casual, but the problem is in the competitive one that he is not so prepared . For example, why can't we carry three grenades instead of just two? The Assasination game mode is generally more competitive (and more original) than Demolition! Why don't we have a competitive way to do this? The weapon's damage is too high to have little health; it is almost impossible to fight back if a shot comes from your side or worse in the back, you see = you kill ... Between this and many others, they negatively affect competitiveness."
23440,"Hope there will be esport scene for SEA too.
This game released in KR long ago but still absolutely good compared to nowaday MMOFPS game, been following since it still a TPS called Viper Circle.
Love the dev, and how they handle the community, taking feedback and quick response.
- PoohVz"
23441,"Cons and pros

Pros : 
You need good reaction timing.
Good aim.
Be able to not rage.
Not pay 2 win.
Good at FPS.
And overall just know how to play competivitly

Cons :
Some of the guns are bullshit.
Hitboxes are weird.
The game is sometimes really one sided.
Wacky game lobby. ( Game is still in progress of getting made. )
Few weapons. ( Game is still in progress of getting made. )
Few maps. ( Game is still in progress of getting made. )

Overall :
Game is really good for playing with friends. :)
Id say its one of the best FPS ive played, and ive played BF3, BF4, Black ops 1, Black ops 2, Black ops 3, CS:GO, Argo, Titanfall, Overwatch. And the list could go on. 

Go and try the game out, its F2P None pay 2 win, and its soo fucking amasing!
"
23442,Good game but servers are shit.
23443,it's a good game get now
23444,"The servers are so terrible, random disconnects happen frequently.  Having said that the game is a lot of fun.  It is a lot like COD.  I think an economy system would be helpful in the bomb plant scenerio's more like what CSGO has in place.  There is no real thought process that goes into the bomb scenerio.  What I mean by that is when the bomb gets planted there is no down side to trying to defuse you don't lose anything by going for the defuse.  I think CSGO has the right idea use an economy based system for bomb scenerio that gives the player something to think about before running in and going for the defuse.  I also think more rounds for the bomb plant scenerio maybe 20 rounds.  It is a fun game though and even without any changes I will be playing and encourage any FPS fan to support this game"
23445,"Gr8 Game, no lag and good graphics. Cool and intence battles buttttt...
Its called Black squad wheen it should be called

23450,"My simple Pros And Cons on Black squad
Black Squad is a f2p action fps that harkens back to the old fast pace boots on the groud gamply of cod 4 and halo 3

fast paces oldschool cod gameplay
polished and good maps
Amazing grafics
decent f2p modle
not p2w but pay to progress faster

Cons -

i3 6100 3.7ghz

4 GB of rams 
so you don't need beast pc to run it. Yes it needs some balance but overall i like this game. I mean what you could wan't more from free and early access game. I would recomend it for competive and casual players It has 4 game modes.

Update

******

This game now is full of hackers and it's impossible to play it nicely. Almost every Battle Mode Map has hackers that pulverize stashes and totally destroy game experience"
23465,"COD with CSGO skins.... simple as that. 

Yes its F2P, i gave it a try and havent enjoyed at all... Very simplistic, no innovation, bland modes, bland weapons, same class skills but with different names.... 

Ill give it a try later, as soon as it will be relased as a complete game, but at the moment I cant recommend something i havent enjoyed.

Mediocre at best 5/10"
23466,Really nice game
23467,Gameplay is pretty good and the graphics are absolutely amazing for a Free to Play game.
23468,Well what can i say the game is actually very nice .
23469,"IT WAS REALLY BAD
"
23470,"No ...... well just no, I would recommend to fap instead of wasting your time with this."
23471,"9/10 
pros:
its free
easy to play
lots of weapons

cons:
you have to purchase weapons
there is no ranked there is only clan wars
only 3 gamemodes, demolition , deathmatch,war battle(or something like that

its a good game try it out"
23472,solid free to play game! Reminds me of the days of mw2 :D
23473,love the game its a change of scenary for a bit till the aaa games come out. If your a fan of counter strike and fps games in general check it out mind you the game is still in early access so things are going to change but deffinetly a great game.
23474,only played a few min of this game and they need work on it and a hack shield if they dont get one hackers will ruin the game other than that it was fun and ill continue to play this maybe they will advance it futher
23475,"Black squad is not bad, its optimized and a good game and fun at early part... The longer you play the game is not fun anymore. Why? 

1. KSG semi-automatic shotgun is OP at mid range
2. SMG are not balanced properly in game.
3. Match making balancing is not that good especially in (BATTLES) joined in a match the team score is 17k and enemy score is 53k how is that even fair?
4. Hit markers are broken, shot enemy twice in the head with a sniper rifle Blaser R93(did not died) 
5. Team mates can be troublesome at some point where 5 guys sniping in one spot, instead 1 or 2 will be enough to hold a spot. 

Overall experience it is not a  bad game, and cheaters as what other people said did encountered some which ruins the gameplay experience. 

Ok after playing it longer in the end it does not make sense anymore... I see players who just spam KSG after playing for 1 to 2 hours. Quitted about 10 matches in a row. And yeah i keep noticing in BATTLE MATCH first team starts good and then after 1 or 2 minutes enemy team got 16k lead in an instant? How is that even possible? 

And the hit reg is awful even if it is on an Alpha Stage, going to lay off the game for a bit it is not fun in the long run. Shooting them multiple times and they just one shot you in the body with any weapons. It feels totally random. Instead of having more matches played i end up quitting matches that arent balanced."
23476,Tac reload
23477,Can You please Add SEA server so we sea players can play soft and smooth pings.. thanks valve and Black Squad Team....
23478,very fun game and content. very realistic and lives up to its name of a non-pay to win game. Balanced game highly reccomended. add my in game smokeyblunts ^.^
23479,"Its a good change from pubg, this type of game style is what started my fps love. Reminds me of the original clansy vegas, people complain of cheaters but I have not really come across too many. If you like fast pace arcade shooters then you'll probably like this game, its kinda simple right now but its to be expected on very early beta. We will see how things come along I'll certainly keep playing this game if it keeps heading into the right direction"
23480,good beta
23481,"Has potential but isn't very good in it's current state. 

The stuff about the netcode being good in the advertised blurb is complete bullshit. You will frequently lag out and die around corners. Hit registration is also poor which coupled with the inconsistent damage system makes for constant frustration. 

As it is, avoid it. Definitely not worth any in-game purchases until the basic functionalities of a shooter are hammered out."
23482,Not really worth playing until shotguns are nerfed.
23483,"It's a great F2P game, way better than I expected. However, I wish weapons weren't so expensive because i find myself using the same 4 guns for while  until I can finally afford a new weapon. The game isn't pay to win either so that's a plus. Overall great game, just needs to fix certain concepts"
23484,"Fast paced competitive shooting that has absolutely no pay-to-win that is fantastic for the price.
This will be edited as needed, with edit notes being below.


After 770 hours in this game, streaming, uploading videos, and spending hours aquiring data, this is my honest review of this game:

Pros:
-No pay-to-win.
-Free-To-Play, but doesn't suck. Seriously, this game plays like a mid-tier first person shooter almost on par with CSGO and COD.
-New guns/equipment can be acquired quickly through normal gameplay. No grinding for a week for a new gun, you'll have one in an hour or two.
-Fast Paced: Compared to other AAA competitive shooters, the action is fast and hard.
-Large Variety of Weapons: This game has a gun for everyone! Guns for Sprayers, 1-Tap Gods, No-scopers, whatever playstyle you have, there is a gun/knife for you, and it doesn't take long at all to get!
-Positive Community: Most players you come across are positive, you can easily find people to add and play with.
-Hit Registration: Unlike CSGO, I've never had one instance of a shot I know landed not register.
-Global Support: There are servers being released often, and support for you to play normally with servers around the globe! Definitely give this game a try if you don't live in an area that is usually supported by game developers servers!
-Multiple game modes: There is a game mode for every FPS player! Team DeathMatch for the COD players, Demolition for the CS:GO players, Battle Match for the Battlefield players, BOT TDM for casual players, and Assassination for the awesome players. There is even a PVE mode they have released for Halloween that is a true challenge, and might even stay in the game!
-Holiday Events: They gave skins out just for playing the game during Halloween, introduced a new game mode, and implemented a lot of new items during the holiday update. I hope this trend continues!
-Community: Unlike a lot of other games, this game isn't toxic as hell. Even with random strangers, most of the time you'll have have a good time. The discord is almost always popping with players discussing the game, looking for a clan, or challenging one another. Beware, people still get salty!

Neutral:
-No voice support: You need Discord or another program to communicate via voice.
-Netcode: This works both ways, the greater your lag, the longer it takes for the server to register your shots. If you go up against a lagger, he will have a slight peek advantage on you. If your ping is in the 300+, you will suffer, but there shouldn't be an issue with servers all around the globe.
-Early Access: Now, I'm not going to complain because this game is free, but it's not perfect. I've not run into anything game breaking during my gameplay, but just keep that in mind.
-Hackers: I have 250 Hours in this game, and I've only ran into ONE hacker/cheater during a battle match. In all of my competitive gameplay, I've never observed, or went against any cheaters. People do cheat, but it is rare in this game. Anyone that says they run into hackers all the time most likely aren't used to the game, or don't play on a higher skill level.
-Boxes/Crates: These can be opened by spending Real Money to buy bullets. Bullets is a currency in Black Squad to open boxes, and to also buy exclusive boosters, epic player models, and more. There are a ton of different boxes in Black Squad, so you know exactly what you will get when you open a box. Want a legendary AK-47? You can click the box and know exactly what you might get. Usually they contain an ""epic item"", such as a rare skin, and all the other prizes include gold, medals, BS coins, and sometimes, even lower tier skins. All the boxes, except for one, require you to pay, and everything inside is purely cosmetic. The only box that you can open for free have exclusive knife skins that you can only get by spending gold to open. Some people get lucky, others do not. This is for you to decide.

Cons:
-Uninspired maps: Most of the maps aren't that great in my opinion, they release new ones nearly monthly, but some of them are just...awful.
-User Interface: The main menu sucks. The friendslist/chat gets in the way of anything on the right side of the screen, you cannot chat in the main menu screen at all, and some items you can double-click to quickly navigate, and other buttons you can't! Why? I blame this on early access, but this goes down as a con for me. I enjoy my efficiency!
-Lack of a competitive scene: Yes, this game is early access, but the only way to find ""competitive"" players is to either get lucky on a clan match selection, or find a team on the official discord. There are clan ranks, but no one takes them seriously right now.
-Matchmaking: There have been times where I've went against a team of 5 when I was by myself for 3 rounds before other players connected. This has happened when I've went solo, qued with a team, or just randomly jumped around. The game will TRY to match you up based on rank, but after 30 seconds, it will just throw you with whoever is on. Doesn't really happen in the competitive gamemodes, but if you play assassination, it will happen a lot.
-No report system: Early access, I know, but if someone is being really toxic, or is cheating, the only way you can report right now is by posting a video on the discord. It's better than nothing, and the mods actually do their job!
-Currency: There are 4 different types of currency in this game: Gold, which is gained just by playing the game and given as a daily log-in reward. Gold can be used to buy most guns in the shop, and is easy to obtain a huge amount of it. Medals, which is gained every 7 days as a login reward, and is gained every time you level up. It is used to buy guns/knives/characters from the medal shop. (There are two shops in this game, more on that later) BS Coins, which is only gained by opening boxes. They can be used to buy different skins, compared to just winning them from a box. Finally, Bullets, which is the currency that can only be bought using Real Money. You use these to open boxes, or to buy a special model, or EXP/GOLD booster. I spoke about boxes in my Neutral section of this review above.

If you're broke and want to try something new, give this a try! You get free currency just for doing a quick tutorial, and if you look in the DLC section, you can try almost every gun in the game for free for 15 days! That is more than enough time to amass enough gold and guns to supply your own Black Squad. Give it a shot, and feel free to hit me up at IGN SL4DE. Happy Fragging!

(P.S. I spent a while writing this review, a thumbs up would be appreciated! <3)

23485,byhi
23486,"the game isnt bad but its far from good, really wonky gun mechanics, little to no recoil, very inconsistent, for some reason once u reload theres a 5 minute delay before the gun realizes it has bullets in the gun so u can shoot. theres no running either u have to switch to knife, that was a bad mechanic in counter strike and its still bad here."
23487," PLEASE add mic support. it will help a lot
"
23488,"Brings nothing new to the table , spongy Gunplay , weird and unfunctional game mechanics.

Save your time on this piece of Shit , it's nothing special."
23489,the best free fps game ive ever played
23490,"really really bad i dunno waht the fuck yall think but yall trippin dont even trip doge""

23491,"So far there's no point to even play this game. Except if you want to shoot others... which you can do in any other shooting game. No competitive mode, no leaderboard... Just another classic shooting game."
23492,good game
23493,"I can't play this game multiplayer!! I press EU, Channel 1 and it shows Tutorial no multiplayer. Please help. It looks awesome in the trailer and I would be waiting for it to release worldwide.
"
23494,"AVA meets SF2 meets Sudden Attack.

It's good."
23495,"this feels like a mix of call of duty and csgo.
its free and gun play is solid.
a good f2p fps game done right, nothing fancy with a decent f2p model
i hope this game doesnt become pay to win or doesnt become too grindy to unlock weapons and make is so that only skins can be bought with real world cash"
23496,dont play this shit
23497,"great
"
23498,Gameplay seems ok. Graphics are not bad and it seems to run smooth. My biggest problem with the game is people overseas logging into NA servers. They all have pings 300+ and their lag makes the game almost unplayable. If there were more NA people acutally playing this could be a pretty good game.
23499,Best FPS game ever
23500,"This is a great game, the developers listen to the community and are always looking for ways to improve the gameplay . If you like first person shooters then I suggest you give this game a try. It isn't pay to win like all other free to play fps, so give it a try."
23501,Good Game!
23502,Worst game ever!
23503,"It is a well made game. Some of the maps and guns need a few tweaks but this is one of the best f2p games i have ever played. When they say it is not p2w they mean it. all the guns are usefull and all of them work well.The give you 200,000 ""gold"" to start with. this is more than enough to buy a few guns. 

The only real flaw would be their english. Its just nitpicking but thats the only thing i can find that bugs me a little."
23504,"oui

EDIT:
After i had taken a break of several months from this game i came back to see it infested with cheaters. Its not bad in the low to mid tier ranks. But it seems like all cheaters have found a collective home in the higher tiers. It often literally boils down to who has the best cheats with half the cheaters not even being ashamed to admit it."
23505,"It's CoD mixed in with more traditional shooters like Counter-Strike, with a heavy sprinkling of Pay-2-Win. Smokes and flashes are rentals, so are all other items. Base weapons are still lethal enough, but the player movement is too slow to make pinpoint accuracy engagements skillful. The game could use an FOV slider and some sort of VOIP. The fact that you cannot talk to your team after you die in Demolition is a complete joke, so if you lose a bombsite, the round's already over because half of the team is unaware what is happening. It's a nice distraction for maybe half an hour a day, nothing more. It's free, looks and runs better than CSGO but has a far lower skill ceilling. If you can aim at people's heads while moving, you're a god on the server. Play it and destroy noobs before they figure out that they need headphones for this game."
23506,guns r  rubbish weird shooting  hackers normal stuff
23507,By the 1 hour of playing the game looks good and its a great game moreover its free to play. Only problem i faced was PING. No Indian servers or nearby... Best i could get was 220 on EU servers. Once the server issue is resolved this game is going way up
23508,"Very basic game made unplayable due to bad servers, extremely bad lag."
23509,This game is amazing whish there was more customization like attacthments or unlockable skins for your guns that you can unlock by doing challenges highly recommend
23510,it's really bad
23511,"i mean i only played it for a tiny bit but its just kinda cheesy and the multiplayer is meh

but its free to play and doesnt force pay to win in your face so breddy gud"
23512,"One of the best games I've ever played

I wish this game has a single player or mission mode, must be great."
23513,"It's a GREAT FPS Game. NO AWP WAR and not much screen tearing, but it has no server in Asia or SEA."
23514,wow
23515,if you are like me dont like pay to win game stay away from this game its an other pay to win game
23516,"at first i thought its not a P2W game but since i started to see players who are buying the DLC packs everything changed while my weapon does 75 damage in the head their DLC weapons does 100+ in the head same as arms legs and etc.

and it sucks that when i spray i hit 6 shots and they are still alive when they can 4 shot me and im dead dosent matter where they hit me.
 yes i know its a free game and it requiers skill (i have skill) just sucks to get kill by a level 1 with OP guns"
23517,Actually a really decent game
23518,I think the team is good for the players. And the F2P is really nc.
23519,An Awesome Game!
23520,"Pretty decent game to be an f2p games 
+ you get free guns
+ it's not p2w."
23521,good game.I actually enjoyed it and no doubt it will be famous one day.The only major problem other than the bugs in game is that there is too many maintenance.I barely get to play due to this maintenance problem.
23522,"It's fun, they give you enough money to buy a weapon so no worries about that. The maps are really small, which can be a bother. But it makes the game fastpaced and more arcade like imo.
The devs really listen to their fanbase, so the game keeps updated and always fair.
Only con is that, there are a lot of autosnipers, and I have no clue why. 

Overall fun shooter. If you like shooters and want to try something new, I'd suggest you try it."
23523,good game
23524,"     This game has very good grafiphics and is very well optimized.It got a lot of weapons(A little too much weapons).Some good gamemodes(I like team deathmatch)There should be added gamemodes like Free for All and Gun Game.
     ScoreStreaks.This game should get ScoreStreaks.
     Anyway from the name of this game you realize is better than Counter Strike:Global Ofensive
     I don`t know how this game could be free to play.
     Good Game after all.
"
23525,"GOOD JOB NS STUDIOS !!! 
This game is awesome. 
Only thing it needs is ping limiter, but game is outside only 3rd day so I hope they will add it soon.
8/10"
23526,shit ass game
23527,"I put in 16 hours within that time frame i have to say this. This game is really fun they have one of my favorite game modes demolition.The gameplay is excellent i didnt have any issues with net codes or frame drops unlike most EA games. However this game is far from perfect one of the most annoying thing about this game is server maintance and server unrealiablity seems like the server are basically down half of the day or they have to do maintance. The gun selection is really small and the map selection is even smaller. Despite all of this small issue i can highly recommend this game its fun but competitive.


P.S This game reminds me of A.V.A but a remastered edition"
23528,I highly recommend this game for all player who wants an awesome FPS games it has Nice Graphics and Gameplay but please can you put ASIA region :D
23529,"This game is amazing especially for a new and upcoming game, would strongly recommend to everyone I know."
23530,"In my opinion, this is the best F2P FPS game out there. Obviously, as it is new, there are many things that can also be changed/fixed.

Pros:
Game runs smoothly even on a low end pc
Its fast paced
Graphics look very nice
No pay to win
Various gamemodes
Plenty of weapons to choose from
Not seen any hackers (yet)
Community seems fine atm (no toxicity yet)

Cons: 
Game sometimes freezes and when i attempt to load it back up it wont start saying that im already logged in, but after 30 mins it runs fine again
Couple of bugs with the crosshair customisation involving dot crosshairs
Hip fire is as accurate as ADS
KSG can 1 hit from 15m away (plz nerf)

Alot of these cons can be fixed and as the game is new i presume the developers will listen to the community and do something about these. In the end, I think its a very good game and i would reccommend it to anyone. Try it out, in the end, its free!"
23531,"Hello guy i am your friendly neighborhood gopnik.I am here today to review Black Squad.

first thing im gonna touch on is requirments if you have cinder block of a computer but you want to play a competive shooter Black squad is a easy to run game. easy 10 fps on very low settings my friends.

but any ways im gonna touch on gameplay it is very fun has simple objectives,for people a little bit more special. It is however like everyother F2P shooter when it comes to gun with the whole timed use or permanant system, but its not P2W the 2 free DLC's you can get let you try them out for 2 weeks and by the time it runs out youmshould be able to purchase the guns you like from the store.(I forgot to mention you dont have to buy it with real money) There is a down side to this however there are microtransactions but there cosemetics of the weapons in the store. I have purchased some and the odds are preety shit so i reccomend you dont use your credits or real money unless its left over and you have no use for it.

overall its pretty simplistic in nature and if you are confused of how to start match click on the region you want to play and then double click on channel 1.
"
23532,very good game good gun play good graphics and free to play i recomend it
23533,"SELF NOTE: Dont ever install this piece of shit again.
So, whats Black Squad? A fast-paced die simulator where you shoot your enemy 6times in the head do to 5 damage while he insta shoots you in the head with a pistol and you die.
Campers dont exist, because you can rush god knows how the fuck you can do it, kill 10 enemy players and then survive to do it again.
PROS: Nice-ish graphics with detailed weapons
Sound is exagerrated but its fine to hear ""reloading"" from time to time
Cons: COMMIT SUICIDE SIMULATOR 2018
I dont recommend this game for those who dont have the patience to die 10 times before they can finally do a kill."
23534,"It's a very simple game built on probably the most stable and time proven engine of them all.

My favourite stategy in this game is crouching with a shotgun, it seems to work very well on tight maps, shotguns are quite powerful in this game, with the KSG I am able to 2 shot opponents even at medium distances, one shot at close range of course. Sniper rifles on the other hand are not as potent, you really have to aim at your opponent's head to score quick kills or else you will be overwhelmed with a hail of enemy fire and soon shot.
Worth pointing out that crouching also renders you completely silent, which isn't realistic of course, but then again neither is this game, we aren't looking for realism here, we just want some fast paced Arena style shooter, which this game delivers and delivers well. 

There are certain aspects of this game that I don't like or more likely, not used to, such as having to select the knife before I get a chance to use it on somebody, I am used to just tapping F in the right moment, but hey, it's a matter of habit I suppose.

All in all, you should give this a try. I definately enjoyed this more than I did Argo. May even come back and play this again."
23535,"I have a GTX 950m 4gb ddr3 , i7-6700HQ and 8 gb of RAM and it runs on 20-30 fps on low settings... hope this gets fixed so i can at least give it a fair try"
23536,need a better anti-cheat pls this game will be awesome
23537,"I am #1 Jake Pauler.

Dab on dem haters"
23538,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
23539,I liked it since I played it for the first time. Very catchy.
23540,shit game
23541,"For some reason people say this is like cs, i say this is like the love child of Osama Bin Laden, and absolute shit weapon damage."
23542,"funny game
cs +cod = bs"
23543,"its pretty bad, guns like sniper have little recoil, or sway, just a fast paced cod style shooting game. not much to tactics either."
23544,Literally warface except with more sweaty fucks trying to be pro at a game that doesnt matter if you want to smash your keyboard over a fat 12 yr old who plays it all day then this is the game for you
23545,Ive only had this game for 1.5 hours and i would like to get a refund. thanks
23546,holy shit the gunplay in this game is awful.
23547,I've played CSGO and AVA.. It's a good mix inbetween and as far purchasing goes.. everything in the game is purely cosmetic that you purchase with real money. SO ITS BASED ENTIRELY ON SKILL. NOTHING PAY TO WIN ABOUT IT. AND IT's FREE TO PLAY = Profit
23548,Good stuff.
23549,meow
23550,"One of the best f2p fps,the gameplay is really nice and the staff is always ready for fix little bugs in the game.
I recommend this game for who is searching for a competitive fps."
23551,Went 51-10 with the OP shotgun. Pls nerf.
23552,verrrrry  funnn
23553,This game blows...
23554,Shittest game ever cant even get on the actily game when i press play it just keeps going offline
23555,too laggy to much desync
23556,"ASIA sever plz, oing is to high !!!!!"
23557,"Game is good but there is some REALLY bad things that need to be fixed ""storage"" map is spawn camping material even with the spawn protection, The KSG extremely overpowered and completely retarded, Some of the maps have great spawns like for me personally I like the spawn in Outskirts and The Boat Map Thing but all the others are just Bad, I had lots of fun on this game but just not enough to keep playing even my friends dislikes the game at first we had lots of fun but another thing is the players Fucking bunny rabbits jumping around corners the guy that rushes you with a KSG and the guy that acts like this is the most competitve game in the world like actually if you are those type of ppl Fuck Off Please no one wants you in this game... But really this game is good and needs ALOT of fixes but personally I would want to stick to warface for a while untill these fixes come in! -zombeez007 (developers you guys are great and im probably gonna buy the founders pack to support you all but please fix these things)"
23558,"the game is fun and i like it but the snipers in this game are too overpowered in my opinion and at some times it was frustrating to play againt a player just sitting in a corner shooting people with a one hit kill sniper. Another things and was Very frustrating in the fact and headshots arent 1-2 hit kill, at times I was hitting people crouching down in the head 3-4 times but somehow I was the one who died from a headshot first. I like the maps but it really was really annoying that every map has a lane where snipers have a huge advantage and if you dont have a gun with good range which can reach your opponent, you're probably gonna die cuz they can shoot you non-stop.

overall: I like the game, its very fun and you should give it try but for me the imbalance with the snipers, headshots not being 1-2 hit kills, and sniper lanes were really annoying while playing.

I think I'll wait for the full release before giving it another shot."
23559,"Best FPS Gaming all hands down :)
good 'ol combat arms/sudden attack feel :)"
23560,"Sniper is too strong, otherwise good game"
23561,"Black Screen simulator 

10/10"
23562,"This game is free so I can't really complain too much. I wish there was voice communication, but for now discord will have to do. The strongest aspect of this game is the multiple game modes. There is 5v5 or 8v8 SND. Then on the opposite side of the spectrum there is a 16 v 16 game mode with kill streaks. There r other game modes but I forget the specifics. Note: different maps exist to suite the different game modes, which I find very important.

Anyhow, In the end I think anyone with an interest the FPS genre should try this game out."
23563,"Recent Call Of Duty Empty Fun - Pay To Win - $60 = Black Squad

Haven't played much at all, but just the fact that it is free and free to enjoy is worth a good review.  The gameplay is a rip from Black Ops 2 & 3 Multiplayer, but without paying a ton or dealing with bought skill.

Why can't more games be like this?"
23564,fun xD
23565,"If you dont use the ksg you dont win any games.  The Ksg wins short mid and long range against any weapon in the game but dont worry its ""balanced"" Kappa"
23566,"Overall a pretty bad ass game.
Small space usage,good performance.
idk, does this game have quick switch?

everyone is bitching about Asian server,but this is goddamn early access,they'll make one after a while, i believe.

so there's one thing i wonder,do every FPS games need to have a case opening system now?
but tbh,i quite enjoy this game.

EDIT: see, i told you motherfuckers they would add Asian server. it's time to shut your greedy ass mouthes up."
23567,nice
23568,waste of hardrive/ssd space
23569,will comeback after SEA server UP. Thanks.
23570,gets boring after 10 mins good for broke ppl tho
23571,It may be F2P for like a week and then it's P2W...also this games' gun play and movement are horrible.
23572,Porque o homi nao foi só :?
23573,"This FPS can be compared to Black Ops as they have a game mode called Destruction with  similar 'point for special equipment' system where you use points earned from kills and objective for high-powered equipment to do more mayhem although Black Ops uses accumulated kill streaks instead of points.

Is it Pay-to-Win? Not really as all items are purchasable using gold earned through daily-logins(15000 gold per day) and matches. Heck they provide 200000 gold for first time players and weapons range from 90000 to 190000 at the point of this review.

The best part is the servers. Although there's no Asia server, I still kick ass at 300-400 ping in EU,NA and SA servers and feel no stutter in movement. only delays in shots and grenades taking effect are noticeable. Matchmaking was ridiculously fast. At least 2 times it was like 1...2 then goes to in-game loading screen. Much faster than CS:GO and CS:GO has few hundred thousand players at any one time.

Developers need to add more content(maps and guns) and Asia server and this game would be even greater."
23574,"Only 7 hours play time sofar, but i love this fast paced FPS.

Especially hit req in this game feels amazing to me and better than in most fps games ive played.
The game is in early access on steam and there has been some server trouble but that doesnt cloud the fact that the game is fun.

No need to compare it to other games. Its a shooter. You kill stuff and have lots of weapons. Multiplayer.

But its just so daaaamn fun :)

Oh and its FREE :)"
23575,"Can't recommend this game at all. 

It feels a CS AWP SniperVille 0.1 with more hackers than you could ever see, some weapons you have to spray over 7 bullets in body to kill, others just oneshot without even aiming...

Recoil feels weird, basic gun doesn't even have any. Magic bullets everywhere (be it from my team or opposing team), snipers doesn't have any negative impact on aiming after moving...

Maps are confusing (particularly Assasination ones), and some are just with bullshit spots you can't know without being killed at least ten times due to the lack of proper killcam (and this is coming from a non-CoD player).

The only time I had ""fun"" is in the Destruction mode, but even this mode has its flaws. You either stomp the enemy or get stomped by them. Some powers (like the air strike) are too overpowered even if you have to stay in place for 4 seconds to activate it, and others sometimes are just plain useless like the Juggernaut. Destruction maps are also WAY TOO SMALL for the mode in itself.

Anyways, got the 10h trophy in game, this was supposed to be 10h of fun with some ugly bits. This wasn't the case, rather the opposite.

Stay clear from it.
"
23576,"It is a mix between Battlefeild, Counter-Strike, and Call of duty."
23577,10/10 would uninstall again.
23578,dead game :))
23579,"This is basically CS:GO, but free....and actually good. Only problem so far is the amount of spawn killing"
23580,not bad
23581,"Shooting feels like battlefield/call of duty, while everything else is basically a call of duty style of csgo.
At least they gave out free dlc i guess"
23582,this game isnt as fun as it looks.

23584,"Csgo meets Call of Duty

Bad: Sound Quality is pretty shitty pistols feels like a bb gun
  
Overall: Its not bad"

23586,"Wish i could play it becase it won let me pley anything besides the tutorial
besides that from what ive played so far its fun"
23587,10/10 would mix csgo and cod together with a lot of maintenance
23588,"FTP, FPS, most computers can handle this game. It's very fun, I've spent the past hour or so playing non-stop, not getting up once. You won't regret it.

Pros:
1) Shoot People in the Face
2) Camp Corners
3) Accidentally throwing a smoke grenade instead of a frag.
4) You die but respawn quickly
5) Has TDM

Cons:
1) You die a lot
2) Noobs
3) Oof"
23589,Whenever I play this I just get an empty feeling. There's nothing interesting and whenever I get a kill it doesn't feel rewarding. I also don't feel like any of the damage spread is right. A good idea would be for a weapon to do the same amount of damage throughout the body and twice the damage for the head. It's still in development so I'll wait a bit before I give up on this.
23590,Nice
23591,"Yes, this game is free to play, and it is an Early access game, this is is fun and has amazing graphics for a free to play game, but the idle timer is too short, and certain weapons are a bit over powered, such as the ksg, i may use the ksg from time to time, but lastely i have noticed that the ksg has a long shot range for a shotgun, and the fire rate is a bit too fast, and as for ar's some rifles have high damage, but ridiculous kick to the gun to the point where it becomes a tapping gun. it has some downs, such as the movement, you can rush into the enemy spawn and jump around and have perfect accruacy with an ar or a shotgun, and for snipers, you can strafe side to side and STILL have perfect accuracy. And as for hitboxes and damage, you can shoot someone in the chest in 3 bullets with an ar and kill enemies with ease, and for the ksg, you can shoot someone across the mapand hit their chest once and you bring them down to less than half health. And as for maps, some maps are too small and just causes rushing and spawn trapping. TDM turns into, ""capture mid and hold their spawn and spawn trap"" i get what the developers were trying to do with the maps, they made one half of the map, and copied it but in reverse for the other team, they would make a few changes for each side, and for certain sides, i feel like one side has the advantage, such as having more cover"
23592,"Very Very VERY good game. Appealing to the eyes, I thought the game was going to run shit on my computer and it didnt even on Ultra Graphics and it looked Stunning! Severly Optimized game super suprized that the game was free.. Cannot wait for it to be released!"
23593,Been playing this game since korea Super fun if you're recking noobs!
23594,"The fucking game doesn't work. If I try to redeem an item I am required to wait god daMN FIFTEEN MinUTeS jUSt WatcHINg a fUckINg seT oF BiTchASs ciRcLEs spIn arOUNd liKe twO intERtWIneD jAR liDS.


10/10 best game"
23595,"I am going to be comparing this game to Battalion 1944 because both games seem to have both characteristics of call of duty and counter-strike.  I will go out and say I think this game is better than battalion,  but suffers in a few areas.
 
Cons:
* The player base is smaller.
         -Longer queue times,  game isn't as exciting as bigger games (my preference)
* Competitive game-modes do not have a buy system.
         -Spoiled by counter-strike,  being able to buy your weapons forces players to learn 
          multiple weapons and become accustomed to a larger array of weapons.  In this game,  
          you have three load out slots which essentially boils down to three different weapons  
          you can switch to at the beginning of a round,  or after you die.  This system isn't as 
          engaging and relies heavily on balancing weapons of all different types in higher level  
          play whereas,  more expensive options such as an AWP from counter-strike has a 
          price for it's power.  There are one-shot snipers that can be used the entire match in 
          this game.
*Grenades are not a default thing.
         -Yeah you have to rent them,  they last a day.  It's just annoying.
*Guns are not as customizable as other free to play shooters or games.  
         -You get skins from crates.  That's about it.

Pros:
*Gunplay feels good.
*There's no prone feature.  I don't see the point in a small arena game,  so I am glad they didn't port that feature from other CoD's.
*Kills feel satisfying?  I'm unsure about this one,  it's loud and you'll know you definitely got someone,  but sometimes I feel getting kills is a bit over-the-top when it comes to sound effects.


Summary:  This game is like Battalion wearing Combat Arms as a skin.  It's okay ig."
23596,"Game is unplayable, game crashes after tutorial. Running game on an I7-6700k, GTX1080TI, and 32gbs of ram."
23597,"It's like a skilled shooter that doesn't need skill.

The guns in the game have their own ways of being used, but for the most part you just take something with low recoil and high damage, then... get this... shoot enemy players.

It's fun, download it and play it."
23598,great game really enjoy it. I was pretty excited to play it and it was definitly worth the wait cant wait to see what else this game brings to the table
23599,"I honestly can't believe I spent an hour on this game. I thought it would get better the more I played but I was wrong.
There's not much I can say that's good about this game. The controls are strange (although changeable), the guns are unbalanced, the maps are horrible, and the gameplay is like a really bad Chinese knockoff of Black Ops 2.

Back to my statement about the maps. The ones I went on were unbalanced and easily spawn camped so most of the time someone could just sit in a spot where you could hardly get them and just kill everyone.

The grenades in the game are like a subscription type thing where you have to buy them using in-game currency for a certain amount of time (ex. 1 day, 3 days, 7 days).

The attachments in the game are shallow and useless, the laser sight does nothing to help and nobody wants to use the suppressor because there's no use for it.

Some of the games I'd end up in on the NA server most of the people would have pings over 120,

Unless you're desperately looking for a free to play shooter to play with your friends I would avoid this game.
4.5/10 - Luckily for this game it's in early access so there's time for it to improve."
23600,THIS GAME IS FREAKING AWESOME FOLKS HOPE RIGHT IN
23601,"This game is really fun and addictive, i have not met any unfortunate crashes or bugs like the ones some users coplained having, the movement mechanism is okay, although it would be better to actually put a sprint button rather than a button to quickly swap to your knife for faster speed :P and the guns are really good, you start with a submachine gun (mp7) an assualt rifle (dont know the name) and a semi automatic sniper (also forgot the name), the players, well i havent met any toxic players. well not yet, im sure that becuase i havent played the game as much as my other games due to my recent download of it, another thing about the players, you constantly find them, everytime i play, the moment i click find match it only take 2-3 seconds to find a game plentiful of players, thats my overview of the game, i gonna list the Pros and Cons to further clearify my point.

Pros:

-Not a P2W game at all, as by the second day you have enough money to buy any gun in the game.

-great ammount of players, you constantly keep finding matches without waiting.

-nice maps, i have really enjoyed the maps i played in, they are well made and have different flank points wich makes the game really interesting.

-the guns, oh the guns in this game, there are so many guns in this game ranging from Submachine guns to snipers, from assualt rifles to shotguns, from pistols to knives and nades, such a variety.

-the gameplay mechanics (besides the sprinting mechanism which ill talk about in the Cons).

-Its god damn free, i mean ffs i dont know what you're doing here, scroll up, download the game and try it out for yourself, its free after all, no harm made, dont like it for some unknown reason? simply delete it, which i dont advise of as this gmae is really fun.

Cons:

-the sprinting mechanism, although this doesnt make you not want this game, its totally fine, but changing it to actually sprint rather than move faster when you have your knife out is really better, although its only a minor harmless thing.

-nothing else, this game is a F2P FPS thats not a P2W game, it has alot of active players, great variety of guns, fantastic maps, i dont know why someone wouldnt like it :P

In Conclusion:
I dont know why you're still reading this, its a F2P game after all, but since you are reading this i might as well say that you should definitely try out the game, if it turns out to be your game and you fall in love with at just like how iv'e fallen in mad love with that god damn R6S for some unknown dumb reason then thank me :) and if you dont like the game uninstall it, simple as that :)

"
23602,This game is horrible. The guns aren't balanced and the maps suck. DO NOT INSTALL THIS SLEEPFEST.
23603,Anybody who is looking for a free to play fast paste game like battlefield 4 but more fast paste this is the game it is really fun and you kill people quick and you start with money to buy one perma weapon i bought sniper but you guys could use it to buy snipers or shotguns or assualt rifles or submachine guns hope you guys enjoy it as much as me have fun =D.
23604,"I literally played this for 9 minutes. Too terrible to play again. Free but terrible but of course, it's still being updated. I don't know if it will get better but damn, i expected a good fps game"
23605,"Bad weapons, how can a FPS game has only unbalanced weapons weird as f***"
23606,"This game is awsome but some mechinacs are out of wack But besides that this game is a real time waster if you want a game you can play for hours this is your game, but I wish they would add a server so you could invite friends and go on quick match and not have to scroll through the wating list for, HOURS. But besides that it is very fun, this game has some potental."
23607,"finally a game where you can shoot the noobs and quickscope everyone

this is the best game ever made besides COD

heck ya!!!"
23608,Pretty poorly done csgo and cod mixture. Not good movement and controls. And guns are just weird
23609,VERY FUN GAME BUT ON THE HOME PAGE CAN FREEZE  FOR A LONG TIME BUT IS RARE I SUGGEST THIS GAME
23610,Its a really nice game BUT ITS SO ANNOYING IT HAS MAINTANENCE EVER 30 minutes
23611,This game is fun but gets boring quickly
23612,"This is a good Maintenance simulator 10/10 would shoot myself again
"
23613,When its not in maintenance. Its a pretty good game.
23614,game is fun but it crashes 12 times to get to lobby then after u play 1 match the game will crash
23615,I know this game is good. I played the tutorial is good but when I went to recive my rewards it takes forever to recieve it so far it's taking 10 minutes to take it the game is great but I can't recive rewards from  it.
23616,"i like the shooting mechanics in this game but everything else sucks... Everytime i get a drop or something like that and i click ""Recieve item"" then it suddenly crashes or takes forever to load.. it's like that evertime. and omg trying to join a multiplayer server for the first time is a pain in the ass. holyshit. everything sucks in this game except the shooting mechanics n shit"
23617,"Supprisingly decent. Its fun and fast paced. It looks like it wants to be a csgo-esk game, but it's a fun time waster in the deathmatch mode. If youre bored and like fps games, give this a try one weekend."
23618,Great game best F2P FPS by far :)
23619,"Review was written by a Closed Beta Partner.



Where as many free-to-play games focus too much on monetization and trying to win customers over with cosmetics, black squad simply allows players to focus on playing a good game. Skill, not wallet size, is the key to victory. The game features a handful of maps for each mode, as well as clans and squads. The game has various firearms and loadout slots, allowing players to hot-swap between playstyles. The weapons have a easy curve, and are just varied enough to have their own twist. Weapons are a simple decision between high-damage, high-recoil or low-damage, low-recoil.

The game also allows you to open two DLC packages that give you about half of the game's current guns for 15 days, so there's that. Being a beta partner, I watched Neowiz and their wonderful staff listen to feedback post after feedback post. It is obvious that they are passionate about fixing things, and are constantly doing maintenance/patches to the game, and are always active in their platforms (Discord, twitter, etc.).

Cosmetics are present, but only make the weapon look better. Skinned items have identical stats to the base items. The only microtransactions present are ""Bullets"", which are used to open crates for random items. However, you can also get the chance to earn ""BS Coins"", so that you can open crates with coins as opposed to bullets and still save money on cosmetics. You also earn medals from ranking up and completing tasks in the game, which you can use to purchase items.


Unlike other F2P shooters, Black Squad's items are ALL permanent, except for grenades. This allows you to ensure that when you want an item, you keep it. No ""3 day rental"" crap, no ""permanent only through microtransactions"", just items to be earned by playing.


All in all, Black Squad is a fun, bare-bones but addictive free to play shooter that constantly changes based on community feedback and offers a entertaining experience for any and all players, allowing people's skills to shine over their wallet size.

9/10"
23620,really good game but has no oce server :'(
23621,"Just another F2P game where hackers are running all the servers. 

This game is just a CS-GO ripoff, sure it has good parts of it, but the moment you start enjoying the game bam run into bullshit aimbotters, some will say ""Oh just get good at the game"" Trust me i am not a sore loser, this game is just bad, if they started shutting the hackers down then this game would be awesome, but i really have no hopes for this game.

Try it for yourself you might enjoy it, or you will see what i am talking about either way i do not recommend this game at all."
23622,pretty good game but im not sure if i like those shiny 1 shot sniper :)
23623,I dont recommend it for the moment. It crashed twice in 10 min. First time when I alt-tabbed and second time when I saved my settings..
23624,"This game crashed my PC twice in the 16 minutes I ""played"".

23626,its good but i wish that you guys could make it so u have to hold the aim
23627,"Definitely one of the best competitive FPS games on the market right now. It's actually kind of sad that an F2P game beats most of AAA titles. I only play 5v5 demolition (a mode simillar to CS/CoD4 Promod), so that's what my review will be based on.

I play the game on the lowest settings (something I do in every competitive FPS) and the game works like a charm. I get almost constantly 200 FPS, which is understandable considering it's UE3. There is a FOV slider which goes up to 80, though unfortunately viewmodel FOV remains unaffected by it. The mouse feels amazing in the game. It's smooth as hell, very responsive with no acceleration whatsoever. It's such an improvement over today's AAA games that the moment I first launched the game I thought I was in heaven.

Movement is okay. A mix between CS and CoD. The animations could be a little less clunky, but it's nowhere near game breaking problem.

Weapons are pretty one dimensional. They either have low damage and low recoil or high damage and high recoil. In my opinion, that's perfectly fine. No need to make things overly complicated. Arguably the strongest weapon in the game is SR-47 which has a serious kick, but once you learn how to manage it, it's really great. There is also easier to manage G36 and MDR. If you're bad at controlling recoil and are looking for a good gun to start with, R5 is probably your best bet.

The pricing on items is amazing for an F2P game. You rack gold like mad for daily/weekly events. You also get gold for logging in daily. This will buy you most of the weapons in the game (including G36 and R5 mentoined earlier). Some guns can only be bought by medals which you also get for daily/weekly events as well as for leveling up and logging in every day for 7 days straight. The only thing you can buy with real money currency are skin variations of the guns buyable with gold/medals, so no P2W at all in this game so far. If someone is willing to invest some time into the game (which should be expected seeing as it's a competitive shooter) then he won't have any problems buying things. The only annyoing thing is that you have to buy grenades every day once your free 7-day trial runs out, however, the daily log in bonus covers the grenade prince and leaves you with a lot of gold left, so it's not that bad.

As for balance, shotguns definitely need some work (especially KSG) and moveshot accuracy of sniper rifles should be nerfed as well (maybe in favor of faster scoping in?). When it comes to map balance, Castle and Carrier are way too much in favor of attacker side - rotating from one site to another takes way too long and there's no way to do it in time unless you sprint the whole time. The overall round timer is way too long as well in my opinion. Something like 2:00 or even 1:45 should be enough, especially considering how short the bomb timer is.

There's also a matter of server stability, but the game's still in early access and I believe that the server problems will be sorted out eventually."
23628,"This game should change their name to 
BLacK ScRe3N

23629,"Great FPS game, its free and so far not pay to win"

23631,this game fucking blow nigga

1- hard to get money
2- no much weapons
3- littl bit maps
4-no much mods
The good things
1-not bad graphic 
2- not bad tutroial
3-fun
4-have a noobs players so u can kill much
5-not bad maps"
23633,"what more do you want for a free game? this game is amazing and doesn't feel like a free game defently would recommened to anyone, you dont need a amazing pc to run and this does not feel like a pay to win game!"
23634,Amazing game for being F2P very fun and addictive. Feels like a paid early access game or a complete finished F2P game. One of the best early access games I've played in a long time. Would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a fun time with friends.
23635,"really really buggy, keeps crashing. pretty fun though."
23636,"really good free to play game , only with freinds tho , like every 1000th f2p game is actually

23639,"Black Squad? More like black screen amirite

because like....... it never starts"
23640,i cannot figure out how to play online only option i have is tutourial which i have played 10 times now
23641,"Another game trying to Be CSGO and call of duty, Way too many hackers and looks like they are doing nothing about it the gun sounds sound like there from 2002 the game mechanics are garbage and Soon it will be P2W....What a disappointment."
23642,"Basically at the moment I would say its in the glory days of AVA/Combat Arms, simplistic, but not pay 2 win yet, mostly because they give you enough currency in the beginning to purchase a permanent weapon in the beginning.  Worth a download if you're bored but want something to waste time with friends."
23643,Better than CS:GO.
23644,"this game has alot of potenial , its fun an low spec , however they need an anti cheat system so many hackers now."
23645,the best part about this game is trying to figure out how to play something other than the tutorial
23646,"PRO:
I really enjoyed the different point specials for the classes.
Runs fairly smoothly.
Lots of weapons!

CON:
Weird Running mechanics
Normal battle maps(Can't anyone do something cool?)
Getting a little carried away with the blood splatter?
Not much a difference between the weapons!"
23647,"Overall the game is decent, but there are a few points to note before spending any money on the RMT store or buying the founders package:

[list]

[*]Made with Unreal Engine 3. The graphics are *decent* but truly show their age, particularly with fire/smoke/particle effects in general.
[*]Their claim of ""great netcode"" is outright false. The lag is incredibly palpable, sometimes unbearable.
[*]Gun balance is all over the place and makes virtually no sense. A vector can one shot across the map, the minigun can seemingly shoot through walls and the shotgun is a nigh-invincible killing apparatus from just about any range.
[*]More of a sticking point for myself, but the translation is simply awful.
[*]The GUI is a terrible mess, reminiscent of old newgrounds flash games.
[*]50/50 chance of the game simply not booting (or booting to a black screen) which you will have to reset your graphics settings to get it to work again (maybe).
[*]Cheating runs rampant. Not sure BattleEye is even enabled as it's not mentioned anywhere other than on the store page and  the startup splash screen. Again, most likely a problem with using what is now a dated engine.
[/list]

For a F2P game, it is decent and, when it works, is actually fun. Unfortunetly, I don't believe that simply being F2P will allow this game to succeed in a market saturated with similar games (GITS:SAC - First Strike is virtually the same game as this) and it feels like Steams Flavor of the Month⌐"
23648,"So far, the game is fun. Contains several game modes like dm and others already known."
23649,"100% the most broken game ive ever played in my life, sniper bullets go a completly different way than you shot, a mp7 with a suppresser can 2 shot you to the foot with 0 recoil, AR guns have 2 mags to reload, and i keep getting kicked from games saying that there is someone already logged on under this account.

2/10"
23650,Amazing game! I think this game has potential!
23651,"It sucks, the guns aren't good
The graphics suck
Feels like a copy of COD and CSGO combined
The controls are horrible also"
23652,"It looks great, it sounds great, it plays great and it doesn't feel like it pay-to-win, heck I'd even say it doesn't feel like a free-to-play game! 

It is not perfect yet however: server stability should be improved and matchmaking should not -under any circumstance- match you up with players that have 200+ pings. But that being said this game has huge potential. 

If they can keep the micro-transactions limited to cosmetic items and tweak the servers a bit, this might be my new go to game!"
23653,"Mar 2019
Changing my review as it has been years and they have not addressed the major issues the game is having. They never fixed the poor netcode. Management was the main reason this game failed. Hopefully that is recognized, as it was a great game. They could have added ping limit and people would have likely kept playing. Now theres only a few thousand playing it, who knows how many of those are ping abusers 8). More ping = advantage btw 




Jul 2017
Pretty fun little game. However, there are some huge issues. More than half of the guns are completely useless. Time to Kill is weird. Half the maps have poorly designed lanes. Also a bug where if you disconnect while logged in, good luck getting back in."
23654,this game needs to fix cuz it often crashes and spending time in try to log in the game
23655,BIGGIE CHEESE DO AGREE IN DIS GAEM!
23656,"The game's maybe doesn't re-invente the genre but what he does, he does it pretty well, fast paced military arena shooter with NO P2W aspect and solid gunplay"
23657,"the game is better than csgo but its giving a bunch of bullshit.
as soon as im happily playing the game i get disconnected,
and then i reconnect and it says this person is already connected to the game,
so i make new account and SAME THING HAPPENS"
23658,"Can't even play the game. Started with a bunch of lines across the screen, tried t fix that and then it froze. Now every time I load the game, it says that the username is already logged in. Restarted steam and my computer, but nothing works."

recommend for playing this game!"

Nice game"
23662,"Hello to all FPS players. I'm one my self and like many vertions of FPS games. But after playing COD, Battlefield, Planetside 2, CS:GO and multipull other shooters. This is the biggest clone (in HD!) of CS:GO I have ever seen. The game play is pay to win. With the equipment for sale with real cash. The play style is health bar combat like a debuffed vertion of Overwatch. And the keyboard lay out is the stupidest layout I have ever seen. E.G the run button is holding down the MMB to run with a knife in your hand! WHY?! I can appreciate people trying to make a game that stands out, but even the clones should say ""Lets get the basics right!""

Some reading this may think I'm a hater with a K/D that makes the screaming kids cringe. But I assure you all that going round corners with an LMG in full pace. Is not ""tactical"" It is just embarrassingly easy. Please feel free to try this as it's a free game, but if you pay for anything with the game in it's current state. You can call your self mad as of 31/07/2017."
23663,"This game is so broken and bad. I get times when i will load up tthe game and all i get is a black screen. I open a gold box all i get is a black screen. this game looks sooo good the trailer is awsome and the tutorial is good but odd at first and i wanted to like this and then i go on multiplayer and then i just hate this so damn much you die from everything and its so random if you kill someone or not like wtf this is nothing like how they showed it i understand its a f2p but this is not what they said it was going to be.
"
23664,"Bull$hit ..... It's only weapon based... OP weapons


........"
23665,I like so so much this game!:))))
23666,"Very Good Game, I wasn't expecting much from this game but it turned out to be great, you may get some server lag but that should be expected by a brand new Early Access game, I know for the people who say its pay 2 win or anything like that this game is really not and you get 2 free dlcs of guns its very nice... BUT you can buy the founder pack for extra things buy the only extra things you get if you even buy the pack are a like 5 or 6 guns and a Name Tag thats all, So after all this I would Recommend this game quite alot to people if they are looking for a F2P FPS shooter this game is very nice very well optimised and has AWESOME GRAPHICS :)

GG Black Squad 







PS: Get THIS GAME AND U WILL ENJOY IT ALOT
And also here is some cheeky little advertising for my youtube channel at  : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ0nBRmex14QsCO9iw9CU8g"
23667,"Game is a very solid game. With a few more touches, I see a great FPS on our hands here. There are a few cons however...

Cons: 
-Not P2W which is always a must in today's genre of F2P games. 

-Gameplay mechanics are very fun which is very unfortunate because today's genre of FPS games have boring gun play mechanics.

-The game is very well optimized, and this saddens me due to the fact that in most cases today's FPS games a majority of people can't run over 60 fps, thus giving us an unfair advantage here. 

Pros: 
-KSG is overpowered af. 


Sorry for my bad English. It's my 37th language.

23668,"Really good game, the system is gream, a combination of a lot of games on one game- like a black & white screen remind COD, gameplay like CS GO, a little of Rainbow six, and more stuff remind some games.

23671,this game is awesome the ksg needs a nerf and more assassination maps also a wider selection of guns but in all the game is great definitley would recommend
23672,"Hello , 

I was surprisingly satisfied when i played this game for the first time..
The smoothness is just great.. the sound is just TOP , The Footsteps , the moment when you kill someone, even the music in the menu's :)
The small details in the game makes it great as well (Clanname under the players name) ,  when you press tab you can see the scores + map how great is that.
The rankingsystem could be a little bit better tho.. cuz its harsh to see which rank you are and when you can create a clan for giving an example.

You also don't have to wait like 5 minutes when the round is finished.. so thats good as well

For a free to play game this is one of the greatest game i ever played and in all honestly i spend allot of money on games that i spent 40+ Euro's on  it and never enjoyed or had a dissapointed experience

So imo they should put a price for this game cuz its defiantly worth it even i don't complain its free :) but you get my point :)

8/10

23673,fucking server
23674,"Very fun for a f2p shooter. It feels very fluid and the guns are incredibly well balanced. I have a lot of fun just sort of destroying in quick match tdm, but the game can get really intense and competitive in the other game modes like demolition. I have had no problems yes with around 3 hours played, and I'm having a blast.

Even if you only play for 5-6 hours before getting bored of it, I would still say its well worth the price tag."
23675,nice
23676,This entire game is you taking half a magazine to kill someone but people seem to kill you in one or two shots with the exact same gun you're using. What?
23677,Great Game
23678,"Very unstable, I don't even understand when it working or not (lobby waiting simulator)."
23679,Surprisingly good fun

My rating : 6.5/10"
23684,"Servers are an issue, But this IS a beta, so.. That's to be expected, The devs on discord reply / update on the bugs etc alot, so you can tell they care about you, and the game. [Devs are also patching to fix servers]

As for the game itsself, I play titanfall, Cs-go, Cod etc, So.. should have a decent idea of if a shooter is good, and this, to me, feels like a very good one, I don't write reviews much, as you can probably tell already, as for ---[Pay 2 Win? Their isn't one.]---   

The starter gun is decent enough to play with
[Remember to get the FREE Dlc for weapons on trial (15 day or whatever) so you can try the guns!]"
23685,I like this game is really fun I like all the mode the character look really nice guns are really cool with the skin the graphics is really good for a free to play game so thank you so much Bryan and Lee and Clare for this great f2p game is a really fun game I can't wait for the next patch notes score 10/10 :)
23686,"A fun and addictive game, good mechanics, and an enticing feel for the weaponry. Would recommend, 10/10."
23687,"Despite a few setbacks here and there, overall Neowiz has come together to create what could possibly be one of the better free to play games of the later 2010's. They did it once with Alliance of Valiant Arms, and are doing it again with Black Squad. The gameplay is refined, the controls are snappy, and the deaths are quick. The gameplay in my eyes is extremely fun and rewarding. A bit repetitive at times, but the overall design of the game outweighs this."
23688,"This game feels like AVA Remastered. Please don't compare this to CS:GO or CoD.. All of em completly diffrent. 
I don't and won't make an indepth review. This is one of those games that, either you like it or not. Find it out youself, its free faggot.

There is one thing, EU server does have issues alot of times."
23689,"What a suprise! a Well optimalized Free to play UNREAL ENGINE GAME? WTF? HOW? 
-Good Graphics.
-Good optimalization
-Good weapons.


Negative:
-Servers are instabile (I know its a new game, they will fix this).
-Damage of some weapons is too low and some weapon damage is too high.


10/8(?)"
23690,"Oh boy where do i start : 

TL;DR : Don't waste your time and money .

C O N S :

*Pay2win : You can pay to get the OP guns fast . 
*Freezing : Do you like games that freez every 2mins  ? well this game is  for you , It keeps freezing no matter what or where . 
*The servers : If you don't have about 100ping you're not a real player :^)
*The devs : OH BOI , They are just like all those greedy game devs out there like warface , warZ ...etc .
*Hackers : Well if get one shooted from across the globe don't be surprised , its filled with russians and asians . 

P R  O S :

*Gameplay : The gameplay is fun actually and better than CSGO , Warface and Black ops IMO and its also fast paced which is always a plus .
*Graphics : While they are not top notch they are decent and enjoyable ."
23691,">Finishes tutorial
-Hm okay, not bad, oh I got a reward on my inbox, lets check it out

10/10 would recommend and play again, devs should change name to Black Screen"
23692,actullay good and fun too play..
23693,"Downloaded the game to only be able to do tutorial rest of the game doesnt even work. Game crashes or freezes during loading into the game, cant even reach lobby on start up. Only 1 successful start up after 5 tries. Delete...\
"
23694,I spend all my life wasting time for this hoping that the DEVS will wake up one day and hoping that they will fix the game but no they keep posting new skins to get more MONEY wait what about the HACKERS IN THE GAME nah forget about them if we give them NEW AND COOL SKINS THAT COST 30 DOLLARS they will forget about them BUT WAIT what about the COMPS lets make the SOLO/DUO A SQUAD so all the hackers will make a squad and join together and brake the game faster! How about you stop making new skins to sell and fix your god dam DEAD game start by fixing your ANTI CHEAT last update was about it but i dont think so now we got even more hackers lets make it simple and fast if you are NEW here and you want to start the game DO NOT GIVE IT A TRY the only think you will encounter is HACKERS!!!!!
23695,"Game itself is actually fun. Gunplay is intuitive and fast-paced. However, game absolutely adores just crashing randomly, not letting you click menu buttons and forcing you to close the game. This is to be expected of an alpha, however.

The gun balance is totally screwed. Shotguns are a one-shot even from a range, and people can take several shots to the head however a single knife to the foot is death even from the front. 

Even with that, the game is entertaining and not P2W since you can pick up enemy weapons and use them for yourself."
23696,"I dont know how everyone else is playing this game , but all i'm getting is the tutorial. Any help out there plz."
23697,THIS GAME IS VERY BUGED
23698,"I have seen and played better. It looks like call of duty and plays like a counter strike game and its an alright time killer.
""Welcome to the best F2P shooter on the market."" Is a bit of an over statement. TF2, planet side 2, Dirty bomb are better games in my opinion and have more depth to, this is a prettyer looking counterstrike game. 

The game has ups and downs;
Looks ok, quick match making, fast respawns, easy controlls.

I can't put my finger on why I wouldn't recomed this game though... well, other than the limited usage grenades and other weps.. (you use ingame currency to purchase a weapon for 1-5-10 days or so, like the blockbuster of ""free to play"" games) the fact a sniper shot to the head on someone with full health takes 2 shots at medium range (I might be spoilt with modren games though) or the inconsistant time it takes to kill someone. 

Basically, its a free vertion of counterstike with ok gameplay/gunplay, If there was an ""eh"" option in reviewing a game I would click it... Its not bad, but it certainly isn't the best F2P shooter on the market. There are better games out there. But if you really want to you can download it, I ain't gonna stop you, I'm just a review on steam.

5/10 <Insert funny joke here> again."
23699,"For a Free to Play FPS it isn't terrible and it does hold up to its promise of not being P2W (Pay to win). Yes there are some things in the game that is clunky like the shotguns are super powerful, sniper rifles are used on very small maps, making them one shot kills if you are quick to react and sometimes it feels even though you are aiming at a guy, your bullets hit the wall. But even after all of that, you will have fun. The whole ""bullets hitting the wall"" thing is true and aiming helps only a little bit, but it isn't terribly game breaking to the point of rage. You even get a special load out in a game mode that lets you be a support, assault or two other classes that gives you benefits like drone strikes and helicopter support. Needs polish but it is free to play and it isn't half bad."
23700,Broken Game i dont see good future in this game it will die in 2 months i promise you that.
23701,I like it
23702,"I did enjoy the game, until it started freezing everytime i opened the game. Tried to stream and it would just freeze everytime. Would not recommend."
23703,"it keeps kicking me off and crashing when i play...
"
23704,i cant in game
23705,Waste of time.
23706,I can't even play it because there is an anticheat error every time i load into a game or the tutorial. I've found NOTHING onine to help. Someone please help!!
23707,"I wish I could set the analisis for something between Yes and No because this game has good points and bad points, lets see all of them.

[h1]Good Points[/h1]

[list]
[*]Extremely well optimized, runs smoothly in my PC with 2GB VRAM and in my super old laptop with 512 VRAM.
[*]Graphics and sounds are decent.
[*]No Pay2Win right now, you can buy cosmetic weapons as you can do in CS:GO but this doesn't impact the weapon stats.
[*]Daily and weekly missions. Also good login rewards.
[*]It's in Early Access and it has a lot of potential if they fix bad points.
[*]Around 10k players in Early Access launch.
[*]Interesting class and skills system.
[/list]

[h1]Bad Points[/h1]

Keep in mind that the game is in Early Access, and these things may change soon (or I hope it's soon), but I'm pointing the bad things at 07/31/2017, I'm eager to be editing this to remove bad points :)

[list]
[*]No Matchmaking (lots of easy win/defeats) just server browsing (this is not saltiness it's said in FAQ page in Black Squad website)
[*]There are hackers, but the game has an anticheat service running.
[*]No ingame report/kicking players system (Can't understand how a game can be released without this feature, even in early access).
[*]Weapon balance doesn't exists right now: Shotguns one shot kills at absurd range, SMGs with more damage and less recoil than Assault Riffles, etc...
[*]It desperately needs more, bigger and better maps. Maps right now are only killing halls and they become boring very soon.
[*]Gamemodes with class system needs to be more polished, Battle mode feels like - insta killed by artillery, respawn, repeat -.
[*][u]I said nowadays it's no Pay2Win[/u], and developers have said they want to keep it that way but [u]Neowiz is a Korean company known for Extreme Pay2Win games such as A.V.A. and S4 gaming, [b]so time will tell[/b][/u] (I hope they keep their word). 

[/list]

This analisis is up for updating with the comments if some bad points get fixed or game becomes Pay2Win (we don't want this to become Warface 2 right?).

Don't forget to try the game and comment below your thought about it.

Sorry for bad English!

Cheers!"
23708,Very Nice Game excellent <3
23709,best fps game ever..HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHHAAHAHAH
23710,POW POW POW PEI PEI PEI POW POW BOOM
23711,"shitty cs 1.6 with better graphics
"
23712,"i wish they can give asian sever
cause it have a little bit of lag when play, maybe 1 sec. But 1 sec lag is enough to die.
Still a good game."
23713,"What's this game like: If CS:GO and CoD: Black Ops 2 had a child.

Pros:
-It is very well optimised and runs on a steady 50-60 fps.
-Even though it has microtransactions, the things you buy are purely cosmetic and there is nothing making it Pay-to-Win.
-Entering a match is very easy and fast, thanks to the large number of players playing all given game modes.
-It's free

Cons:
-It feels like there isn't much feedback regarding engagement with opposing players, and what I mean by this is: the time to kill is VERY FAST, but even when you are getting shot you don't quite realise it until you're already dead.

To round it all up: it is a good game, given it's free, with a large playerbase and anyone interested in fast paced combat should give it a try."
23714,very good game <3
23715,"--Edit--

The game is still complete trash. 

Smoke grenades and tube launchers dominate TDM. 
Nobody plays any of the objective game modes. 

And hand grenades are a must so you can just spam throw them. 

Unless you're a masochist, this game is just not balanced or worth the time put into it. 

Those that disagree are the ones performing the aformentioned ""tactics"". 

It's not a First Person Shooter. It's a First Person Thrower."
23716,"
[b]Summary of this game: 
Shotgun campers in corners, spawn killing, grenade spam, everyone jumping around like a fucking kangaroo, takes like 10 shots in the head for someone to die, too many glitch spots, maps were basically made for people to camp and hide in corners, customization is ok not good, music is terrible, movement system weird, everybody using the sme overpowered guns, shotguns too overpowered, recoil system weird.
You're better off just buying CS:GO, CoD, etc.[/b]"
23717,look like a solid game. but it need more servers.
23718,"WHERE THE FUCK IS THE PLAY MATCH BUTTON!???????????
ALL I SEE IS TUTORIAL AND I DID IT LIKE 100000000000000 TIMES ALREEADY -_-"
23719,"good game, 
skill based, 
shotguns are still a bit to strong, but +1 for the good communication by the devs"
23720,"Lol new game and still 
fuckin hackers"
23721,"personally i played beta and i play it now when it came out a few days ago. with that being said this game isnt a week old yet but has a lot of potential. Their are moments when your like what? and sure you can get shotgunned across the map but black alpha is a decent game, better than 90% of those p2w games"
23722,Good idea but feels like a kids game. ie the controls and gameplay
23723,"its a great game really fun.The graphics are great for a free to play
"
23724,Fcking Awesome
23725,why no sea sever ?
23726,pretty damn awesome i tell ya easy to get in to to train fps skills. good job devs 10/10 would play again
23727,Like cod
23728,"Fun game, good mechanics. Some bits are still a bit wonky, but devs are very in touch with the community and are working on improving it. You should get it to at least try. Its fun!"
23729,Currently I wouldn't recommend. The aim is shakey and feels fake which needs to be fixed and that is a minor problem in itself but the most annoying thing about this game is the ping limit. There is no ping limit and if this continues it'll be like the rest of the other fps games which will die and be taken over by people who have 300+ ping. There needs to be a cap and an asian server not only because of high ping but there is also latency lag so when you hide behind cover the person lagging on the other team can see you perfectly fine in the wide open and this is a big problem.
23730,"first of all i have not played this game much but i am already sick of it
Cons:
1. there are many typos in the guides
2. when you start the game and go to tutorial you are forced to play with very small sensitivity
3. main screen is hard to navigate (i was lost and couldn't find the matchmaking)
4. you have to have knife on your hand to be able to run
5. recoil of every gun feels like its random
6. first game (against real players) i played and enemy team had aimbotter and wallhacker (no joke)
7. snipers are way too OP
Pros:
1. its F2P

-if they fix these then i might consider giving it a 2nd try.
-when i saw the game on steam it looked promising but after i launched the game i have only seen bad things, in my opinion this is one of those games that belongs to the deepest corners of Steam where no one visits.
this is might opinion and might not reflect your opinions, so don't come here just to comment negative things about this review."
23731,"I don't play game because ""BattlEye"".It's lose"
23732,"So am i suppose to enjoy this?

It looks like plastic even on ultra 

and you run with a knife?

"
23733,Fun game that needs some updates but what do you expect with a early access and a game that only been out for a few days definitely would recommend!!👍
23734,its great
23735,"Let's not talk about the weapons balance. For now they're pretty balance but may be they will introduce some broken weapons just like another Neowiz fps - Crossfire.

+ Fun to play
+ Well designed mechanic
+Fully customized weapons

-Grenades are not permanent, require a gun with grenade launcher so you won't spent 100k gold for a month of grenade rent.
-Lack of servers (for now there's only EU, NA and SA).

Hope u guys keep on updating the game and then fully released it!!!
p/s: SEA server asap plz, i can't carry a team while having 250+ ping
"
23736,"This is a fking scam. I thought you can buy skins with real money, but you can only buy fking retarded random boxes and gamble your money away. Pathetic."
23737,"thought this game was going to be something special. It is CSGO with ADS. And it is plagued by failed csgo players with thousands of hours, going against a bunch of randos' that most likely don't touch CSGO (like myself). it is a shame, but at least it's free aye?"
23738,reminds me abit of csgo and all the old FPS games that you played for free and had to buy all the weapons and armors with micro transactions. if you want a weapon for perminant use you are going to grind alot for that change and buy that weapon. but they have good graphics. if you cant efford 10$ for cs:go you can play this game.
23739,"At current state, I cannot really recommend the game.

- Weapons are unbalanced
- Shooting system is wanky
- Headshots do not work. Head damage is increased, but it takes two rifle shots or three pistol shots to the face to kill a hostile
- Maps feel relatively empty and do not really present interesting situations.
- Gamemodes feel lacking
- Customization is feeling really confusing with all that ""license"" system and 

Pros:
- I didn't really feel P2W.
- Game is free and it provides shooting experience for free. And it has a relatively good graphics for a free game.

Because the game is free - I may suggest you to try it and decide if you like it for yourself. I personally will be trying it after future updates, maybe balancing will make it more playable for me."
23740,"Guess its a bit pay2win/play2win People who have played more will have far superior weapons and the people who bought the dlc also, Its a alright game, Would rather play cod tbh."
23741,good
23742,i can„t download free DLC. Why ?
23743,"""NICE GAME ,CONTROL R SMOOTH AND NICE GRAPIC """
23744,"Awesome game, should play it, but a little hard to play online"
23745,hi
23746,its good
23747,"Overall good free to play shooter. good shooting mechanics, not overly pay to win."
23748,"This is the most generic free to play shooter I have ever seen.

This can either be a good or a bad thing in your opinion so I'll just go down the list of what I've noticed - 

The Good - 
-Solid Graphics.
-Guns That Actually Have Recoil
-Good Gun models and overall textures.
-To further that, Graphics are solid if nothing special.
-Guns handle well and aiming is smooth.
-High Frame Rates.
-No pay to win elements (yet) Everything except cosmetics can be grinded towards by playing.
-For now, a large player base.
-Multiple classes with various capability.


The bad - 
-Sniper Rifles are Overpowered, easily one shotting and instant aim.
-This unbalance makes assualt rifles and SMG's basically useless. 
-This also applies to OP shotguns, all or most one shots.
-Maps are very basic, and have lots of long corridors making the sniper issue worse.
-Absolutely nothing original or fresh, really.
-Very slow grinding.
-Limited selection of weapons per class, most classes having at max 4 or 5 choices. Some only having 1 or 2.
-Derived gameplay. If you have played AVA, you have played this. It is basically just a slight upgrade that runs better.

Overally I got bored with this game very quickly. I played for a couple hours at most and was completely uninterested in it. 
It is highly lacking in content with very few choices as far as weapons go, with some very clear winners in each category that make the other weapons completely obsolete. 

Such as the HKN Assault rifle and the Type 95 absolutely dominate. They do higher damage than all the other assault rifles (45) and while they kick like a mule compared to the others, their time to kill is brutal with a 2-3 shot kill (If you get a headshot, it is two shot kill). The G36 is also in a similar class at 35 damage per shot, which also promises a 3 shot kill body shot and a 2 shot kill with headshot. Though it trades raw damage for a bit more accuracy and control. If you hit limbs in can potentially be a 4 shot killer too, so less reliable. Or of the opponent has heavy armor, it can be more.

Whereas the other Assault rifles tend to have less recoil but have far less damage per shot (Varying from 27 to 33) and results in far more 3 and 4 shot kills meaning the top 3 damaging rifles outclass them overall .

It is a similar theme for the SMGs (Though there aren't many). There are only two, but the clear winner is the Kriss Vector that while slightly less mobile and with a slightly lower rate of fire, has a much harder hitting shot (28 versus 22) meaning the Kriss will always be a 4 shot kill max even with a silencer. Whereas the MP7 has to hit 5 times (Due to armor protection lowering damage further), 6 if you are silenced.

Same with the LMGs. You have two choices. One is clearly better, MK46 is better in most regards to the PECHENEG. The MK46 sacrifices two damage per shot (32 versus 34). That 2 damage could be useful in theory for the PECH if the target wasn't wearing armor, allowing it a 3 shot kill instead of a 4 shot kill. But in practice everyone wears armor and both are a 4 shot kill to the body, 2 shot to the head. In reture for doing 2 damage less however, the MK46 is more stable, is more accurate, has a higher rage of fire, and greater mobility.

The sniper files are the same way.

You have 4 choices. 3 semi-automatics that are 1 shot headshots but 2 shot body shots. You start out with a semi-auto that is pretty much no different between the other 3. They are useless compared to the other rifle.

The other rifle is a bolt action sniper rifle that is a one shot chest or head shot. So unless you are an amazing headshot guru you won't be needing the other rifles.

As far as shotguns, they are both brutal but again one is slightly superior - The KSG. Both are pump action, but the KSG does so much more damage, nearly 50 Percent more, and no one is really concerned about the recoil of a pump action that corrects itself before the next shot nor accuracy because you are using it at close range only.

So to sumarize - 

-Smooth performance and tight controls.
-Large player base.
-Good Graphics for a free to play.
-Quality modeling for weapons and textures.
-In Game changeable silencer is kind of cool.
-No pay to win model.
-Does exactly what it sets out to do: Make a Free to Play Shooter that is smooth and good looking to mimic smoother gameplay of modern AAA shooters.

-Absolutely nothing special and generic in everyway.
-Highly unbalanced weapons of which there are clear winners in every category.
-Shotguns and sniper rifles absolutely dominate and frustrate SMG, AR, and LMG users.
-Minimal content to unlock, many weapon types have 2-3 choices.
-Heavy grinding to unlock anything through gameplay. You earn 400 to 1000 ""gold"" per match for the average player. Most weapons cost between 96000 and 192000 meaning for the average player (, 750 gold per match) that means to unlock any single gun or piece of equipment you would need to play between 130 and 256 games for each and every weapon.
-Very boring and has no features as of yet that would really bring me back to it after a couple horus with better choices.

Overall I feel this game would have been very successful if the free to play market wasn't so overrun with generic military shooters already and it had more content.

However in its current state and with essentially no feature being unique in any way, I cannot really recommend this game.

Though the caviet to that - It is early access so I will keep an eye on it. 

Hopefully they will add more content, create better maps, and add some features that make it stand out."
23749,This game is a better copy of CS:GO can't say if its a ripoff but so far i like the game . Keep up with the good work and updates .
23750,"Its a mixture of CoD and CS:GO. It could be good but right now it has alot of issues. 

+ fast gameplay
+ no p2w

-Spawn protection (even after firing your gun)
-silencer will be detached after every single respawn
-silencer will disappear from weapon from time to time
-Damage model is weird
-maps are nowhere near balanced
-maps are too small

Add the fact that the game is EA so it is most likely going to fail like every single game ever that offered EA. 

As I never recommend shooters without Anticheat like CS:GO or cashgrab innovations like the CoD series I can recommend this. Its free and definitely worth to try out."
23751,Could be really good with a few updates and map adjustments.
23752,"high ping for me (sea area), hope asap create a sea server, game is fun"
23753,"Basically an updated version of crossfire. You get a hefty sum of money, enough to buy 2 good guns or 1 high tier gun, pay to win isn't present at the moment. Infuriating some times but overall very fun."
23754,Cool!
23755,"From a hour of gameplay and what ive found is this is a very good succesor to warface and id play it over warface any day
there is some obvious room for improvment like the hip fire accuracy issue but thats what early access is for and sniping in the game is amazing its a mix of cod and csgo sniping which is just the perfect combination 8/10

Pros:

Can buy any gun  u want right off the start
Not pay 2 win
great sniping mechanics
guns are balanced
very nice graphics for a f2p shooter

Cons:
you have to have a knife out to sprint
you cant prone as far as i could tell
maps could be a bit bigger it seems as if your fighting for a hallway most of the time 
Terrible and confusing ui"
23756,piece of shit
23757,this game isn't very good
23758,"A really fun game to play considering that it's a free to play game. A game that you can put many hours in to if you are looking for a fast action FPS game. It really has that COD vibe to it. No pay to win elements even though there is a shop in the game where you can buy different weapons and perks, but you can acquire all of these with the in game currency that you earn by playing the game and leveling up. The only thing you can buy with real money is ''Bullets'' that you can use to buy cases to get skins to your weapons."
23759,no just no
23760,"Combat around AR´s feels very good, feels like other guns will still need a lot of balancing though. What for what I´ve noticed so far it seems like shotguns are far too powerful, and SMGs just feel like ARs (usable at all ranges).

Overall a fun F2P FPS which ain't P2W (yet)."
23761,Its actually really good! BUT my computer renders it unplayable most of the time. So whatever. Good game though.
23762,good game didnt see any cheaters or toxic players
23763,Its Great!The game is wanky here and there but its a lot of fun!The only thing that i dont like is the shoping system because the starting weapons are better anyway?The game is great and few fixes will make it even better!
23764,Very Nice Game ! But i have a problem  i open launcher i click play but it wont open can you Please Help me ?   !!
23765,cOMPLIMENTI TUTTE LE ARMI ROVINATE CON ULTIMO AGGIORNAMENTO INCAPACI..........
23766,Amazing game! Cept only thing that killed this for me...No Oceanic Server :(
23767,"How do I start a game? I can only click tutorial..

But the tutorial showed me that free FPS games are not always bad. From what I've played, I recommend it."
23768,"Yeah you will have fun with this game 

IF YOU ARE 12 YEARS OLD KID 
"
23769,Wow. I hope my insurance will cover all the chemo I'm going to need after playing that tutorial. I want my .2 of an hour back...
23770,"So good game, thumbs up! <3"
23771,"A generic shooter that, thank god, [b]isn't[/b] pay to win.
Aside from that, there isn't anything else to say. You have guns, you have classes and the skills you expect them to have."
23772,Absolute garbage heap of a game. Stop making free to play fps please.
23773,"great game from what i have played pretty polished but realy needs ocenia servers making it realy hard for my friends and i to play from aus, feel like the fan base would expand a lot once the servers are implemented"
23774,"Finally some F2P shooter I can enjoy.
I like the free 200k Gold which can be used to buy the most expensive weapons too."
23775,Fun F2P shooter

But too bad my friend can't join 'cause of region block (Indonesia)"
23777,lul hackers
23778,"pretty fun. it doesn't do anything really special except letting you take your supressor off whenever you want. so that's pretty cool.
but if i had to pay a cent... i'd want my money back.
but it's free so that's all good"
23779,"Don't play cs go cuz it's a shit a waiste of money.This is the best shooter free. 

I recommendit"
23780,As a famous steamest steam reviewst I give this game dog shit rating -5/10. This game is so bad this is the type of game you play if you live in mexico with a shitty laptop and play this all day cause your poor and it free.
23781,"- Too much random horizontal recoil.
- New players need to grind to have a good sniper rifle, the default sniper rifle is horrible. 
- Alot of screen freezes.
- Moviment is unreal and stupid.

+ Good maps.
+ Good anti-cheat.
+ Free
+ Alot of noobs"

23785,"YES, this game is alot of fun once you get used to it by knowing what weapon your most effective...no strategy of any at minimum ..a good ol spray n pray type game.. it reminds of a watered down version of black ops, probably alot higher pace if thats even possible. no bad at all for a FREE game!!!"
23786,"/h1  I SAY NO BECAUSE THERE IS NO YES/NO OPTION AND THERE ARE MORE CONS THEN PROS BUT READ NEXT PART
DO NOT PLAY UNLESS YOU LIKE A CHALLENGE AND YOU ARE OKAY WITH DYING A LOT

This game has nice graphics and smooth gameplay but there are to many negatives to give it a positive reveiw. I will start by saying you can get killed right after you spawn in the spawn area and the that play are rude so those put together people will stand at the spawn with snipers and kill everyone as soon as they spawn. some of it is fun like when you find a long hallway and have a sniper battle or when you hide and shoot and duel with someone for 5 minutes until someone is dead. And I have had fun with some satifying kills with a sniper. Its interface Terible and took me like 10 minutes to find out how to get into a game.Also it has terrible matchmaking so if you get in a game most of the tim if you are new someone that has played enough to get a one shot kill gun will dominate you in the first20 matches.

But overall it has goood graphics it runs smooth but the people will kill you in spawn the map is stupidly tiny (like in 20 seconds you could be at the other side of the map walking)and the spawn has no baricades for damage (Obviously with my other pooints)and there is terrible matchmaking and the first couple ours you will probobly be dominated. And the interface to get into a match i the worst one I have ever seen in my entire life.

So in conclusion dont play if you are new to the genre but I encourage you to play if you want a challenge and you are ok with getting killed a lot."
23787,"Typical F2P easy ass game

It's garbonzo beans."
23788,"Did the tutorial 5 times, still didn't let me go in a mutiplayer game :/"
23789,"awesome free to play game

(Maybe adding a way to kick players could help with that)"
23792,"well as a free to play game its decent , don't expect triple A things but its far better than any free to play game i have playeed , if you are bored and you want to shoot russians , this game is for you ."
23793,SEA server please
23794,"This has got to be the worst game I've ever played in my entire life. For a game that came out in 2017, it's wayyy behind the other games, I've played other free to play games and they were 1000x better. It's so bad that when I tried to close it with task manager, it made my entire screen white and I had to restart my computer. To be honest, I think it uninstalled it's self because I can't find it in my library and I haven't uninstalled it. 2.5/10 (points for effort and cheesy puns)"
23795,"a great game
"
23796,"Not that bad. Not pay to win. Good time killer, nothing more."
23797,"Generic af.
Encourages spawn camping.
Very boring."
23798,very good game for a free to play game. If this was paid it would be worth it!
23799,The game is actually a decent FTP fps shooter.

23801,"game is pretty fun, hit registration is pretty trash tho"
23802,"this game is very interesting.. I am a FPS player and this game is enjoyable especially when you get into JUGGERNAUT mode.. 

Pros:
Easy to play

COns:
No SEA server.. damn high ping"
23803,"Its actually very fun and the guns system is unique , NO P2W, Hope divs keep developing 

one thing i hated is that i opened the golden box like 6 times and i only got the stupid smoke grenade!! :D"
23804,Easily the worst game I have played in my entire life.
23805,Is anyone else lagging hard because I am and it's not fucking fun. I just want to play this game but it just reaches to 600 pings. By the way this is the only online game that reaches to 600 pings.
23806,Below average free to play shooter.
23807,"Whenever I try to play, I always get ""cannot begin communication 229."
23808,"Well, if you looking for F2P FPS games this one could be in your list.
This game have a lot of things combind., such as COD + CS + FPS Online(Korean Game) like S.A. or S.F. 2.
However this game still in early access game, maybe we will see something change from this version of the game.
But just couple of things I don't really like it. First, will be sniper gameplay, it's not feel 'fun' like the other many games do.
Second the limit to pushing to enermy base or enermy spawn. I think you have to put a limit so the enermy can't push too far. And one last thing, the camper in this game also have not really effect to the game much so I'm gonna say ""Good Job"".

Score : 6.5/10 - Note: -1 for the sound in game. They did not do well on sound. -1 for only knife you can run. -1 for everytime you respawn you need to put slinser and the laser on. -0.5 for the main menu and lobby."
23809,"Well this game had potential in closed beta and now that they have come to open beta and released their pay model it is absolutely ruined. P2W but only through RnG.  One of the worst systems I have ever seen in a f2p game.  Literally 4 currencies and the one you earn in game is so slow you might as well not try.  Also only half the guns are available for free and not the best ones.

UPDATE!!!
Just to further prove how shitty this company is, and how they took a great concept and ruined it.  At Twitchcon they gave out in game codes for guns.  ALL TEMP!!! 20 day guns.  What are they thinking? Why do companies take potential and shoot themselves in the feet with these pay models?  Make everything free with easy to earn in game currency and you pay items be cosmetic.  Why is this hard?


Update AGAIN!!! I tried it again.  It has only gotten worse.  The only lobbies left are filled with aimbotters. Still P2W RNG in 2022.  Even with an 800 playerbase they refuse to try to save it.  Game is dead.  Was a cash grab from the start and I will never buy anything from any future games from this developer."
23810,This game would be pretty good if it had bigger maps. Even the 32 player maps are very small.
23811,played the tutorial and uninstalled lmao
23812,This game's purchase system alone earns this game a spot in hell.
23813,"I love this game, Because it has the perfect movement speed and hip fire accuracy, it's enough to have anyone join in the game game without being too complex, although the servers could expand, if you're in asia use the EU servers. Black Squad Devs Pls keep the permanent weapon business model at those prices because that could be the saving grace for free2play fps"
23814,"This is a pretty good game with decent shooting mechanics, it feels like a mix between Call of Duty and Counter Strike. Although there are microtransactions associated with a free to play game, they aren't really necessary to play unless you want better weaponry, however grenades are limited use and must be purchased with in game currency along with most of the ""better"" weapons, though its along the line with other F2P games. If you want a fun free to play shooter that runs great on older hardware, then this game is for you."
23815,"I really gave this one a chance, but there are so many problems with it. Until they fix everything in the next update or patch I wont be continuing to play it."
23816,TAC RELOAD!
23817,"Despite some flaws that are certianly fixable as part of early access, this game is very promising.  I look forward to seeing how it improves over the early access period."
23818,Dont ever had to ADS
23819,Solid game! The best of CS and COD (old ones) combined.
23820,"Love this game Please add support for controller support i.e xbox 360/xbox one/steam controllers, also other modes such as capture the flag..would also be great!"
23821,"[b]TL;DR at the bottom![/b]

Ah yes, yet another Free-To-Play online FPS game... I'll be honest, I wasn't really expecting a lot from this game, that being said, I was pleasantly surprised.

Let's address the elephant in the room, that being the cash shop and premium items. Yes, there is premium stuff, no, there is nothing you can buy to give you a stat advantage. The only thing money will buy is a currency called Bullets, which are just skin crates. that's it, so far. It's wayy too early to tell if this will evolve into something more sinister, time will tell on that front.

Since that is out of the way, on to the rest of my unduely long review!

[b]Graphically[/b] this game looks pretty nice, animations are good, the maps follow their own colour palettes, some are brown and grey, some more colourful. Overall map design is all very simple and easy to get a hold of, the maps are easy to learn and navigate.

Textures look good, haven't seen anything blurry or that stands out as weird, the graphical design is all very coherent if not a bit dull. The guns look very nice and tacticool.

[b]Sounds[/b] are good, there are a couple music tracks and they're decent enough, mostly rock\metal style music, some songs sound a little bit quiter than others but it's nothing major. Gun sounds are everywhere from unique and good sounding to mediocre and bland. The starter pistol sounds like an airsoft gun. However you can generally tell the weapon type being fired pretty easily. Footsteps are loud as hell, making walking a very important tactic to employ since it'll make you completely silent.

[b]Gameplay[/b] is very reminiscent of Call of Duty meets Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. If you played any of these titles, you'll feel very comfortable in this game. The guns have almost no recoil making assault rifles feel very samey, they mostly are the same aside from varying stats, such as one rifle might do more damage with a slower rate of fire and smaller magazine size, while the other has a much large mag size, and fires faster but has lower damage.

The available primary weapons are Assault Rifles, SMGs, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, LMGs and Designated Marksman Rifles (DMRs). They're all very straight forward, however shotguns in this game are brutal, they can take someone out with a single shot from quite far away, they have barely noticable recoil, and they fire quickly. Basically, matches, especially in Demolitions, will come down to who has the most KSG shotguns on their team, and who sees who first.

Game modes are fairly straight forward.

You have good ol' Team Deathmatch which is addictive.

Demolition 8v8 & 5v5 which is identical to DE defuse game modes in CS:GO, minus the buying. 

Assassination, where one team defends a VIP (controlled by a brain dead AI, mind you.) that can die in like 4 shots, as he waddles to a helicopter. The other team has to kill the enemy team and the VIP, or kill the VIP and extract from their own helicopter. This mode is very... meh. It's out of place and not fun.

And last, but not least, Battle Match, where you have to work with your team to destroy the enemy base, which are giant supply crates or something. This mode is where classes come into play, and it's pretty hectic and clearly the main gamemode. It's okay, it's certainly one of the better modes. The maps for it are quite large as well, which is nice.

The combat is very, very fast. The time-to-kill in this game is intensely low, and fire-fights rarely last more than a couple seconds. Pretty much every weapon kills in 2 - 1 headshot, in some cases like the shotguns and close range, headshots aren't even needed to take someone out in a split second.

Grenades in this game, unlike CS:GO, are lethal. While easy to avoid, catching one will seriously injure or just outright kill you from full health.

There is ""sprinting"" in this game, but it's just pulling your knife out ala CS. However the interesting thing here is you have the option to hold a button to take your knife out, and then swap back to the last weapon you had upon button release. It acts like a sort of sprint button, very different feature I've never seen before. Knives themselves are just 1-hit kills if you manage to land a stab, 2 - 3 hits if you just swing it.

[b]In-Game Store[/b] is where you purchase weapons and stuff like that, and I was pleasantly surprised with it. There is really nothing to buy with actual money, and they give you a LOT of cash to start with. You get 215k just for starting and doing the tutorial, guns range from 96k - 192k, and they are permenant, no repairs or anything like that, once you own a gun, you keep it forever and can use it forever. Cash is very easy to earn, you get 15K just for logging in each day, 20K or so for dailies, and around 800 for each match completed.

You also have weeklies. They award Medals which let you purchase more novelty items, like player cards, side-arms, skins and stuff like that. A Desert Eagle costs 1,500 medals, after only about 15 matches I had a little over 1,000, so it's not hard to obtain.

Overall, the store is quite nice, the menus are a bit hard to navigate, though. It remains to be seen if this game will turn P2W, only time will tell.

[b]Community[/b] ohhhh boy, the community... It's already really bad. Very toxic, a vast majority of the people you play with are actual children, racial slurs, hostility at the slightist provocation, you name it, this community has it. I highly suggest not interacting with the people in this game, for your own sanity, and the safety of your braincells.

[b]TL;DR[/b] It's very nice if not a little graphically bland, it's a very small game (only 4.3 gigs) and doesn't require a sign up, the combat is pretty intense and fun, it runs fairly smooth, no pay-to-win as of yet, no timed guns or BS like that, the guns are easy to earn, the gamemodes are alright, but the community is incredibly immature."
23822,"Black Squad is trying too hard to be like Call of Duty. I'm not just saying that because I'm a Call of Duty fan boy or something like that, because I haven't liked a Call of Duty title since CoD4. There's plenty of better free shooters out there if you're looking for something fun to play that have better mechanics and shooting."
23823,It's a fine game 8/10
23824,gsf
23825,Game is GREAT for a free to play title. We shall see when the game become P2W or not...
23826,This game is very very fun
23827,"Its Actually really good for a Free to Play game, if you dont have much games definitely give it a try, If anything the menu screen layout could be a bit confusing."
23828,its fun
23829,Best game ever
23830,"it was too hard

tac reload"
23831,"Next CS?
"
23832,"Glitching as hell and hackers none stop every round, and many bugs as well"
23833,"Just ignore the negative comments, they are all made by little pricks with notebooks from 2010 that can't even run Minecraft above 30 fps. The people crying because the kill time is high and there is no recoil don't realize this is EA, and, by what I read, they are CS fanboys that expected this game to be a shitty copy of that game but for free. This game DOES have CS elements, but don't expect a copy, it is like a mix of COD and CS, very fast paced, excellent graphics for a f2p game, not p2w, access to all weapons for free, paid things are ONLY cosmetic and the maps are very good. Only cons, gun sounds are meh, servers lagging and kill time could drop a little, but still, it is EA and f2w. Give this game a chance, it deserves it at the very least."
23834,What a disgustin fucking game
23835,"they added weeb skins, gtfo with that nonsense"
23836,"it's a good game but it needs some improvements
pros
+ great combat
+ great wepions
+ fun
+ great modes
+ it runs great for me
+ great updates
cons
-  it sometimes frezzes
-  some crashes
- so many hackers and cheaters
8.8/10
black squad team heres the things you need to fix
- getting rid of hackers and cheaters
the hackers have gotten worse,
they are slowly killing this game."
23837,feels like a cheap call of duty with micro transaction.
23838,"At first I loved this game, such a fun game. but latley the devs seemed like they stoped giving a crap. they aren't fixing the problems they are just shoving dlc's down everyones throat."
23839,"Game looked pretty decent from screenshots I guess but nothing else really. I guess here's a review from what I got from experiencing one game, and then afterwards going into maybe like 20+ blackscreens when trying to relaunch the game after crashing after the one game I had played.

Pros:
-Steam Store screenshots
-Uninstall button
-???

Cons:
-Black screen simulator
-200+ ping on NA servers LUL
-Garbage free2play foreign shooting mechanics
-Garbage movement
-Slow clunky menus
-Terrible system for a store, done a million times and disliked by all time and time again

Solid 0/10

Wouldn't play garbage game again :)"
23840,"Your basic to go [b]FREE[/b] to play FPS with, surprisingly, no real currency weapons that gives you an edge to the competition.. Just skins. Everything runs smoothly, there's no jitters or any noticable performance issue. 

The only thing this game is missing is some sort of Competitive Mode. Also having 16 ping and fighting someone with 150+ ping on the daily and dying behind a wall, which you can't penetrate, gets abit annoying. Needs a solution.

Overall, I'd say you should definitely give it a shot."
23841,wOULD BE good if i could not have the game freeze everytime i click something in the menu
23842,Waste of computer space.
23843,"Fun but some guns are broken
"
23844,ITS H A C K E R CENTRAL!
23845,"I played the tutorial twice because it would not let me play online. Rebooted it twice, game froze, and now only shows a black screen. It won't even go completely full screen. At least the tutorial was ok."
23846,"Don't waste your time.  Horrible hitboxes, no ping restrictions, bad netcode, hitreg wack, smg's doing more dmg than assualt rifles, just to much to list.  I tried to give it a chance but after the 30th game of everyone on the other team having 300+ping and 1 tapping you while you put a whole mag into them.."
23847,"An awesome game! 
Hope they could put in AU servers later on
I'm from new zealand & it's laggy on EU servers for me.
Trust me, it is a great game worth playing & buying the DLCs on my payday so A+
"
23848,"Still a better shooter than CS:GO...

I find this game quite fun. The shooting sistem isn't the best but is still better than any CS or Black Ops.
You can play for hours (if you have friends) and don't get bored. 
You can't be mad on a free to play game cause it's not like the payed games (Rainbow Six, PUBG, GR Wildlands) but it's still better than other games.
Give it a try, I had fun, maybe you'll have too...

PS. Sorry for bad english (that's for grammar nazi XD)"
23849,Game is pretty fun for a f2p csgo/cod hybrid. Hopefully they release a halfway decent ranked mode.
23850,Good free to play game! Good choice of weapons and reasonable progression! Hope the Devs stay focused!!!
23851,The best f2p shooter there is period.
23852,"I downloaded this on a shitty laptop expecting it not to run but it did with over 30 FPS average to my suprise to that is a big plus to this game. My only problems with the game are that maps are way too cramped and have the time I get spawnkilled with KSG users just because in this game the spawns are very close to each other. Overall though, I think this game has potential if the devs release frequent updates and bug fixes."
23853,"One word ""lame"""
23854,Its copying csgo
23855,"Feels like an old arcade FPS, like combat arms. The screenshots and description had my hopes up. There is no tactical gameplay it's just running around shooting."
23856,"Wow. This game runs like an absolute DREAM. The guns feel good to shoot, and nothing hidden behing a pay wall. Settings are fully customizable, cursor, which side you want your firearm, etc. At 144fps it's like butter. Don't mind the salty CS:GO fangirl wannabe's. This is a fun free FPS.  Can't wait to see how this grows."
23857,"surprisingly the game is very fun a good mix of cod and cs def worth checking out. 
best part is ists f2p and not p2w."
23858,"if you like iphone-game-tier shooters this is for you.
can't play with friends unless you somehow manage to find their names in the 8-name-per-page list of people in the lobby, shooting mechanics suck, movement is crap, oh and best of all it's pay to win."
23859,demasiadamente bom
23860,This game is absolute trash. Tac Reload the fuck outta here
23861,"Everything was done shoddily in this game. I'm constantly getting shot around corners (with a ping of 30 might I add), the time to kill is incredibly inconsistent (it can be instant or several seconds when using the same weapon and hitting all of your shots), and the game is too fricking chaotic, it's just spawning and dying, or spawning, getting a grenade or ninety thrown at you, and dying."
23862,"Let's start of with my experience, i must say this is the first game in a long time that has entertained me for 6 hours straight, looking forward to play this game for a longer period of time. i haven't played against any hackers at all. The game has nice graphics. it's a pretty damn good game that's only 4GB.

The game looks pretty neat, the guns are looking for good, the shooting has a nice sound almost as if it's real.
Like i mentioned 'no hackers' this may be different in the future, but who knows what kind of hacks are becoming available in a couple months. The game is not pay to win and has a nice gunstore to purchase guns with in-game currency. After playing for the first time i noticed that the game is similar to Alliance of Valiant Arms and Counter-Strike Global Offensive, so if you're coming from the Alliance of Valiant Arms/Counter-Strike Global Offensive community and you're looking for a similar game i would recommend Black Squad.

Some flaws i came across were that they have a clan system, but there's no clan matchmaking? i came across some well known players in Alliance of Valiant Arms, they totally rekted me because they said there was no clan matchmaking. I was pretty disappointed. What i also noticed was, they make you quick match without seeing who you're playing against or what the current score is. So i joined a match and the score was 5-0 for the opposite team, guess who scores a free lose?
Since when do i have to shoot someone in the head three times to kill him?

The game overall is great, but the minor mistakes ruined the first time experience for me although i would recommend this game to anyone. I have high expectations for the game."
23863,It is an interesting game. It is pretty much Counter Strike: Global Offensive but free. You can get knives that look cool and skins. Definently would play this game if a lot of people don't have CS:GO
23864,">Completed tutorial

23865,"Game play is trash don't be fooled by the vids. Why do you think they show no actual live gameplay? Because it's totally shit it's just people running around spraying they're guns controls are shit reminds me of wareface but even worse. If your looking for trash game to play look no further. Way to much hype for it most of the positive reviews are most likey from kids who don't pay attention to detail and are the kids who if you gave them a game with better graphics, controls, shooting styles. They would all say it sucks ass because they can't run around and spray. Do not download 2 much hype for the game"
23866,"Did the tutorial on the worst sensitivity known to mankind.

Immediately went into practice mode afterwards, spawned a bunch of bots, stabbed them all in the nuts with 100% fatality, game immediately crashed after the nut genocide.

10/10 - Would stab all the nuts again."
23867,"Saw the game played on Twitch and decided to check it out. Turns out, it's actually a pretty solid free-to-play shooter. There are no p2w aspects and you can get the currency (gold) to purchase new weapons fairly easily depending on your performance in matches. Then there's the bullets. This premium currency is used to purchase boxes to get skins for your weapons, but it's definitely just cosmetic stuff you pay for a chance of getting. 

Overall I'm pretty satisfied with the game and for the price tag you really can't beat it. Check it out, and if it's not for you, at least you didn't pay anything for it."
23868,"Let me preface this review by saying This is the worst shooter I have ever played in my entire life. 

The only good thing I can say about it, is that it runs smoothly. No frame issues, no lag, nothing. That's it. From the moment I started the tutorial you are forced to play, I knew this game was awful. Honestly, there is nothing special about this game in any way, shape, or form. I figured I would at least give it the benefit of the doubt of having a terrible tutorial. It's just the tutorial after all, right? ...Right? WRONG. What followed was the most forgettable, bore of a team deathmatch game. After navigating the AWFUL menu system, the game started. Literally all you do is kinda of slowly strafe around and hit the world's largest hitboxes in gaming. That's it. The end. I'm sure there are objective-based game modes, but why would I venture forth into this cancer of an F2P fps after this gut-turning, shit show of a match. I have never felt so bad for a gaming community in my life. And I've played DayZ. In conclusion, when this game claims, ""the best F2P shooter on the market,"" I can only assume it's the only one. If anyone, literally anyone, came out with a shooter they spent more than five seconds on, it would be leaps and bounds better than this cancer of a game. 

God have mercy on your soul, if you click install."
23869,"This game is one of the worst shooters I have ever played in my life. The fact that it was released in 2017 and uses the Unreal Engine 3 engine should be your first clue, but once you get in and start playing you'll quickly realize the mistake you've made. There is absolutely nothing positive I can say about this game, everything is god awful and no one should have to be put through what I just had to go through playing this game. If you want a F2P shooter, go play Warface or literally anything else. I could see this being a game people would have liked if it was released over 10 years ago, but even with the bad F2P quality that games have now, Black Squad sets a new low. 

The only logic I can come up with for why people play this game is there is a small community and people are ridiculously terrible at the game. If you really suck at shooters, you might like this one. But being first place on my team in my first match when I was doing absolutely terrible says a lot.

Save yourself the cancer treatments and stay very far away."
23870,"The game is pretty much Call of Duty + Counter Strike.
Its well optimised,runs without a problem,looks very good for a F2P game,someone who is good at FPS games,will love this!"
23871,"SHITIEST CALL OF DUTY I EVER PLAYED, NEED TO SHOOT 4 TIMES IN THE HEAD TO GET A HEADSHOT UNINSTALL ASAP WASTE BOMBACLOT"
23872,Games like this...make me....want to.....eat my own ass....worst game 2017....with out a shadow of a doubt! This shit......TRASH BRUH
23873,"Casually fun, a bit repetitve with all the spawn trapping though."
23874,A pretty casual shooter with CS:GO and CoD elements
23875,this game is overall amazing
23876,"The game is an arcade type shooting, like Call of Duty, except it's good, and you can actually earn things without spending $."
23877,"I'll reccomend this game on the key fact that its just mindless free fun. 

There are some problems though. The guns in particular. Not difficult to use next to nonexistant recoil and just feels weak to use. No visual recoil or satisfying sounds to make it feel nice to use. Hopefully it can improve."
23878,"Well i was looking quite forward to this game, after plaing for a bit i will say im a little dissapointed. Its not a bad game but definetly not a great game. Connectiong is pretty awful,, you can expect to be shot from around a corner.... a lot. Team balance is also pretty bad you either destroy the enemy team or get dominated. The Battle match game mode is a lot of fun but is toned down due to the maps, they just dont flow very well. I feel that there is just a overall lack of content. If you like assualt rifles you good but everything else is very skimpy iv only counted 2 shotguns 1 of witch isnt even worth using when compared to the other, only a few smgs as well. So far i will not reccomend the game. Ill continue to play and see maybe its just first week problems like most games tend to have. Also community is awful. Make to much noise and expect to get cussed out and blamed for the reason why a dude is 1 and 5 lol"
23879,Needs OCE server...
23880,"Very cool game, good mechanics, feels like the good old counter strike before all the hype. 

I'm going to keep playing!"
23881,"Spent first half hour wondering why I couldnt break 30fps with my GTX960M, only to find out I needed to change my preferred graphics procceser in my cards settings. Never had to do that before. Now runs at 120fps solid and looks like a good game. They arent kidding about that no pay-to-win either."
23882,"ALthough the game may not be everyone's Forté. the game is very well optimised. The hit detection is, actually pretty good suprisingly. Grenades don't have any real impact.  The communnity is toxic (but that's most communities right?) The first thing you're greeted with after the tutorial is a confusing start menu. They give no direction on how to start a game they leave you to fend for yourself.

Pros :
Fast Gameplay
One-shot headshot (although could be a con for some)
Demolition has a chance to be competetive
Cheap guns
Most things available to purchase are cosmetic MOST
Detachable supressor on all guns
Optimized extremely well
Amazing graphics, even if my computer isn't  a beast. Steady framerates, no cuts even if a lot is happening on screen.
Most things you can buy that boost your performance you can get in game with just a small amount of grinding.

Cons :
Peeker's advantage
Perspective is messed up: basically you can get killed way before you see your enemy
Grenades have a very small impact
Confusing main menu
No  real customizability when it comes to attachments. 
No way to know how to global chat. I googled it and it still didn't work
Slightly toxic community

but all these can be improved upon. Well this game isn't AMAZING, it is worth getting into.
Overall? I give it an 8.5/10

(Oh yeah add me on steam @ http://steamcommunity.com/id/opinkdolphin if you want some help learning how to play <3)"
23883,Extremely fun game. Not many shooters can pull off repetitive fast paced fun like this. Feels like CS with a twist. A+.
23884,it good without hack. but unfortunately you see them in every match. report button not work
23885,JUST A  FREE  BLACK  OPS 3
23886,"Having played over 1k hours of CS:GO and hundreds of hours of CoD games, I'd have to say that this game is suprisingly good. The gunplay and avenues for strategic display are quite high for an early access F2P shooter. I would reccomend at least trying out the game, you have nothing to lose."
23887,"Black Squad is a Free 2 Play fps run and gunner.  

Easy to play, small size and seems easy to get ahold of atleast 1-2 wep extra of your choice in the beginning. 
However. The lack of things to challange you in this game might bore you if you ever played any other FPS multiplayer game. Running and gunning is fun for a short while but since running doesnt affect your crosshair/recoil/bullets _at all_ it might feel at bit stale if you are used to a bit more of a challange.

But, it is free to play, and that is a good thing and it helps making this a good game. If the game would ever get a bit more ""realistic"" with the movement/recoil/speed it could become a great game.

"
23888,"im blown away... A F2P that isnt Pay to win... its actually good.
10/10 for a free game
If they release updates on a daily basis, and dont switch to pay to win, this game could be the beginning of something amazing.
Just dont do what warface did. Please."
23889,"Oh my god --- why??????????????????

there was no reason to make this game but someone actually went and did it.  CS:Go did not need a remake or an update and this game ust make sit worse.  Do not play!  Do not spend money on it! If you have friends who play it disown them and get better friends."
23890,"-minimize game while in main menu
-entire computer locks up and I have to force restart it

I don't know man...."
23891,"I tried to play the game and you need a clan to play, u cant create your own clan and have to wait to join one."
23892,Better than Combat Arms! Not P2W in my opnion.
23893,Combine the worst aspects of warface and cs go and put them in unreal engine (the worst competitive fps engine) and you get black squad.
23894,"I hate when they do not clarify if a game is pvp or pve. Ill save you the trouble , this game is pvp only in its current state.
hopefully they add some pve at some point."
23895,"It's actually not P2W. I'm plesantly surprised.
Now excuse me. I'm gonna go grab a shotgun and kill everyone on the map.

Oh yeah... the balancing is fucked and the aiming is a even more aim assisted CoD in terms of how little recoil there is."
23896,"Ive played many FPS games in my times. and this one doesnt have the best graphics, but its so fun to play so the graphics dont even matter. ALSO, you can run this on almost any pc/laptop.  i play on a laptop and i was so suprised to see the amazing fps i got this game is definitely worth the try... i mean seriously... IT'S FREE!!!

EDIT: after playing for a bit i think its needs these 3 things.

1. More secondary choices, and some buyable with gold please. (like a revolver)
2. bigger maps for TDM.
3. ALSO please make a way to respawn with a silencer and laser sight  already on, i hate dying and having to re add it to my weapon everytime, please allow it to be toggled."
23897,I Use 'A' and 'D' more when shooting then any other button. 10/10
23898,Soooo many aimbots. Enough said.
23899,"like h1z1, no skill gap, any trash can kill you, burst more accurate than scoped, crouch spam on point, here we go shit game, thats why its free"
23900,"I have to say I had some hopes this game would be really good, and... It is.

Gameplay: 9/10
This game has a really good gameplay and feel when you simply play the game, you have a primary weapon, secundary, knife and grenades. In the beginning of a match, round or whenever you die you got to choose from 1 of 3 presets you can costumize.

Graphics: 8/10
This game looks like it is a AAA game from 2014. It has some quality graphics if you put everything on ultra but for me, it felt poorly optimized. I had a bigger framerate at ultra than at high, weird.

Free-to-play?
Yes it is free-to-play and FREE-TO-WIN. There are some paid elements in the game such as skins and guns but you can get them with the ""free"" currency you gain by playing. The paid ""stuff"" has no impact on gameplay, they are only cosmetics.

Suggestions:
I suggest a competitive mode because the demolition (5v5) is very similar to cs:go, and that is a good thing. I like the tactics you can make as a team and its just amazing to play this game, but its not very rewarding. If you win a game you got some xp and coins (i think) but if it was competitive (it can be just as it is, who reaches 8 points win) but it could have some ranks, like bronz, silver, gold etc.

Overall i would say just try it. You might like you might not, but you don't loose anything from downloading the game and trying so do it!"
23901,"I would rather play this than CS:GO.

I prefer games with more open battlefields though."
23902,might as well be a flash game
23903,"Free game with decent graphics and gameplay, and its not pay to win. Each class have unique skills, Assault uses Claymore, Grenade Launcher, Hellpike and Juggernaut. Support use Medkit, XM25 Grenade Launcher, Sentry Gun and Artillery Support. Commando uses Ammo Kits, RPG, Trophy System(no idea) and Heli Support. Finally the Recon's abilities are UAV Drone, Sonar Vision, STEYR50 Sniper and Air Strike."
23904,"Can not leave positive feedback. Game is fine, but full of cheaters.

Game got even worse:
#more cheaters
#badly unsynced

Deleting for good"
23905,<3 this game
23906,"from what ive played so far this game has got good potential to be a great fps game, personally the hit boxes are a bit iffy but thats to be expected at the time of writing this as its only been available a couple of days, if it stays away from pay to win it will be a brilliant title"
23907,Best F2P FPS game now in the steam....Play the game ASAP until Hackers destroy the game
23908,"This game being free to play, offers better dynamics and gameplay than other FPS shooters.

I would really like to see some type of difference between both teams, like more variety of characters or outfits. 

That being said great game."
23909,"Another Korean COD-esque rip-off
Also broken english lol"
23910,"Exelent game to be f2p , things that are missing : 

1-kill cam
2-nerf mp7
3-info hp enemy when u die"
23911,i cant play this game and i dont now why i need help
23912,"It's an interesting game that has a lot of variety to it, but it's not polished. The actual visceral feeling of an FPS is missing. Movement is a bit clumsy. The guns feel like laser tag. You might liken more to a COD then a CS:GO."
23913,"Pretty solid game for free to play!

Pros: Optimized really well.
Good Ping all around for US servers
Starting money is great for new players who want guns
Guns have attatchments already on them
LOOT BOXES
Variety of game modes.

Cons: Shotguns too OP
Too many people from SA don't play on their own servers so you get a lot of laggers.
People with high ping seem to have an advantage
When you want to switch game modes, you have to leave the lobby and create a new one for friends.
Sending invites to friends only work if they're on the main page."
23914,"Not bad, The SMG is very overpowered on TDM"
23915,"Honestly, it is a really good game.  I recommend it to everyone who likes playing video games."
23916,"Utter Garbage

1/10 - Not worth your time or HDD space.

Bad graphics even when maxed, it looks way worse than a Source Engine game
Gun play is just bad
TDM is basically grenade spam
The Tutorial was cancer

If you want a good free-2-play shooter play Argo not this garbage.
"
23917,"The game is nice but it takes no fucking skill, you can literally run & spray and get kills."
23918,"Games fun. Doesn't bring anything new to the genre like how Call of Duty was before jump packs.

Guns are permanent, no renting except for equipment I think.

Has a 32 player mode that's just explosions everywhere. Not fun with a bad team

Has 8v8 and 5v5 competitive modes without a MMR system. Also not fun with a bad team but fun when the teams are equal in skill

TDM's a clusterfuck, nades and AWP equivalents everywhere

Can do good with the starter guns so no P2W

Quake, ArenaFPS, and CS vets will dominate everyone

Not as good as Dirty Bomb but way better than the other F2P Eastern FPS like how A.V.A. was before it got fucked"
23919,Pretty okay. I mean. You cant play it serious but some plays look nice when you spectate.
23920,good XD
23921,load of hackers
23922,A solid shooter. got kicked from the game for cheating when i wasn't though
23923,"after playing csgo everyday i must say this game feels like 2017 game...
hitboxes are ok they work...
not pay to win
graphics are good
menu could be better

but for free to play i feel this is how csgo should feels like when it comes to shooting. Like the idea of silencers and other things."
23924,"The game's netcode is alright but flawed, if the enemy has high ping you're fucked. It takes 6-7 bullets for me to kill someone whereas I get two shotted and it isn't even a headshot, nor a shotgun or a sniper rifle. Hacking is rampant, unfortunately I can't reccommend it in this state. And to all of you who lick developer's asses with ""IT'S EARLY ACCESS"", this is the base of the game, there's very little to do to improve it, this is Black Squad, where two shots to the chest reduce an enemy's HP only to half whereas the enemy one shots you magically at 400+ ping."
23925,I just wish this wasn´t free to play because its good
23926,"If you would Rather Play to complain or Pay to piss people off then your getting neither from this.

Your getting an equally justified game that is Fun and Fast paced that no one can complain about. 

a Free (Really Free) no pay to win game like this is getting my stamp of approval! 

Even when i lose matches i felt like i was justified by the large amount of players i killed or enjoyed struggling to kill.

The balance in this game is great and keeps the action fast and fun. Your gonna die if you want to or not lol but thats what makes this game enjoyable!

No one lives forever and the game is Free to Play so why dont you just leave that Positive Review for these guys and let others know this exist!"
23927,I love it.
23928,Just dont download it
23929,"shameless counter-strike copy&pasta, even the logo. except for spray patterns/control. pretty beginner friendly, definitely competitive, but in the end you can just play csgo if you're looking for a simple 5v5 bomb game. black squad feels kinda raw and i dont think this is going to change towards the full release. good alpha tho, nice performance, solid gameplay. AND it's f2p on strong servers/netcode without being pay2win, not bad."
23930,nice game
23931,WHen a miniclip game get better graphic to be accepted into steam
23932,"**EDIT** I have now hit the 200 hours mark in the game. From my previous review, everything seems to be exactly like I said. They still ask for feedback and work with the community. Big update came out, we finallyu got clan wars and custom match. Their updates are nice and big so that a lot of content from the KR version gets in the steam version. This game, definitely is great!

**EDIT 2018** It's been a while since I have played the game and and only get back on it when they have special sales on bullets. It seems that after around 9k bullets I have yet to have gotten a knife. Main reason why I quit this game, lol. btw not recommending anymore."
23933,"-started the game.
-did the tutorial.
-joined team deathmatch
-played for 4 min.
-got kicked from the match with a message that says: NOTICE An error has occurred with the anti-cheat program. The game will now be closed. Please restart the game.
-restarted game.
-same thing happened.
-tried 2x more times.
-uninstalled the game.

I rate this game 11/10.
Those 4 minutes were pretty fun. :)"
23934,"Game looks great and plays like CSGO (with more action, but a lower skill floor) or COD (with less obnoxious killstreaks...though they still exists) depending on the mode. 

PROS:
-Sound and Graphics are excellent
-Shooting mechanics feel awesome
-Optimized...rarely have less than 120fps even with a lot of action (980ti, I7-6600k)
-Variety of game modes
-Matchmaking is fast
-Weapons balanced...so far

CONS:
-Can't set crouch to toggle (maybe I'm missing something)
-Limited customization of weapons/character"
23935,"Ultra graphics - 110 fps, very low - 125"
23936,some unfinished cs wannabe
23937,"This game is really great, very well optimized, good play style, a mix between Counter Strike and Call of Duty, when you finish the tutorial it gives you 200K gold, though the 3 msot expensive weapons cost like 192k, the other ones are around 90-120k which is really cool, its not a pay to win game.
I strongly recommend this game. :)"
23938,"Your average F2P Shooter.

No tactics, linear maps, movement and aim offer no depth."
23939,"Wait wait wait.... a legit F2P multiplayer shooter? Yes it is. In game currency can buy every weapon, there are skinned versions of weapons but the stats are the same. Purchasing weapons with game earned money isn't a bad grind at all and you get to keep the weapons permanently. PERMANENTLY. 

If you want fancy skinz means skillz...well I think you have to pay cash or git gud."
23940,na
23941,"As expected, community is cancer like any other FPS xD, but good game."
23942,THIS IS THE GAME EVERYBODY HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR; THIS GAME IS GONNA SAVE THE EARTH. jk BUT SERIOUSLY it was good.
23943,BEST FPS F2P SO FAR.. RECOMMEND FOR EVERYONE.. PAY A NO CENT ON THIS GAME... ! GREAT GAME !
23944,nothing new but its free.
23945,"Game is Great! but...
-unlike other games similar to this 1 like cs:go(in 5v5) there is no communication. which sucks every just runs in different ways and bassicaly. DIE on their own. which leaves me with more people to deal with.

-i would'nt say this is pay to win but there are guns that need BS coins, which you cant aquire in-game, but i cant blame them. i mean this game is free so of course i would expect there to be some things that cannot be aquired easily.

-this game doesnt really need skill, and i would love if they added competitive.
 
-need more attachments that isnt like F or T but.. u know what i mean.

-fix desert eagle, right know it SUCKS."
23946,"It's a good game, a great quick load and lots of fun! however if you don't mind being shot through a wall it's okay. The Devs are active for sure, so I'm sure the hackers will be cleaned out soon enough.  It's a decent shooter that will run on about anything that goes 'beep'. Would have been nice to have it on Linux too save me having to use one of my Winblows machines.

Graphics can be tweaked up or down, the rewards and shop are great! no p2w it's just pure mayhem and quite a good one. Even playing on an ancient Core Duo (with dual 460 GTX hehe) it's nice! but turning the gfx down renders it playable on anything basically.

Pro's
-----
Good game, no real learning curve, shoot, duck, move and repeat.
Decent, solid GFX engine and nice maps.

Con's
------
Loads of potty mouth'd kids who can't handle dying ..
Hackers or at least tweaked players (via unreal vunerabilities)
Maps... maps are great but too small!

Other thoughts (that are pending developement)
Sniper / Steady scope needs tweaking.
Just get the hackers sorted and it will shine even more!"
23947,If CS:GO and COD had a baby.
23948,"great game for a free to play, good mechanics good gameplay overall i enjoy it 8\10"
23949,10/10 would tac reload
23950,im going to be completely honest. This is 100% spray and pray simulator. Its really poor maps. Poor hit detection/hitboxes. You can walk around a corner and spray people and almost guaranteed a kill but the rest of their team will come pouring out afterwards and spray you to death. Aiming is almost worse than hipfire. The maps are small and one side usually has an advantage. Its just not fun.
23951,COD:GO
23952,"I am sorry, its a nice game but I don't like it.

The feel is wrong, like a lot of other non-AAA fps the feedback of each shot is weak. Though the feedback for getting kills is good.

Everything is generic. Nothing is new. I hate this fact, call of duty is not the apex of fps gameplay. There needs to be more mechanics, more tools to play around with, more ways to kill enemies.

There are only one type of players this game is attracting, that can be changed easily."
23953,"This game... IS THE BEST F2P I EVER PLAYED!

If you like CS:GO and Call of Duty, but then free? 
Go play this game!

This game has:
Amazing grafics for a f2p game.
No OP weapons, everyting is balanced.
No Bugs atm.
Big weapon Selection.

The only bad thing on this game is that the cool looking skins that I want to buy needs REAL money. :C

9/10"
23954,the game is good and fun but it feels too much like CS:GO the menu is a little confusing and default sensitivity feels too low but is Early access
23955,Very bad aiming on this game wouldn't recommend for that reason but other than that very good game for free i guess :)
23956,nice
23957,Garbage. No balance at all.
23958,Its combat arms but HD 10/10.

23963,"Gameplay is like like COD, but worse (if thats even possible). 

Like most Free2Play Shooters its Pay2Win.

[h1]Rating 1/10"
23964,the only good call of duty for pc
23965,"Fun game, it's still in progress, developed based on community suggestions too. Keep up the good work."
23966,Great game had alot of fun playing it for only one day hope that they keep going with this amazing game.
23967,"This game is VERY different to most free to play shooters. It implements a type of honor system that you never see EVEN in 60$ games. This game's claim that it's not Pay2Win is true, and it's truer than a fucking glass of trumoo milk. There are cons, but they definitely don't outweigh the pros.

Pros:
-Not Pay2Win (which elevates it above most first person shooters nowadays)
-Weapon balance is pretty decent
-Maps are a good size for the amount of players per match (And since there's no sprint they're decent
-Plenty of assignments to complete that earn you extra credits (Base credit earning is pretty slow, this makes up for that)
-graphics are pretty enjoyable even at lower settings
-Lightweight game, an IBM computer could probably still run the game at 30 frames
-Unlike 99.9% of shooterss, the devs LISTEN to the players, I know, crazy right? who would've thought that all you need to do to make a game good is listen to the idiots playing it?
(Comment if I forgot something I guess)
Cons:
-I haven't personally dealt with this issue but I hear hacking is a minor issue (I think they're working on fixing this though)
-The KSG is currently op as hell and is a pretty cheap gun to use. I'd probably want it to either be removed or heavily nerfed
-Credit earning can be kinda slow, but since everyone else goes at the same speed as you it's not that bad (not Pay2Win as I've repeated like 3 times now)
-Not too many players online yet

Most, if not all of the cons are being worked on though, so probs in about a month or two this review will be more outdated than a comment about trump in the election. To conclude, just try the game. It's only like 4.2 gigabytes so it won't be a long download, and even if you hate it, it's free, so just delete it."
23968,what a piece of trash...
23969,Best UI 2017 thanks gabe.
23970,"DO NOT be miselead by the screenshots and trailers of this game. Don't even waste your time downloading this game because it is insanely repetetive, awful graphics, and terrible voice acting. Spawn trapping is common every game and the default controls are horrible. I lost interest 20 minutes in and wanted to make a video for YouTube to show how shit this game is but realized this game didn't deserve any more of time. Absolutely avoid this game and CSGO, Battlefield, or Call of Duty. I understand this game is early access and making video games is not easy, but if you are going to choose to make video games, at least make them worthwhile."
23971,"    Short versoin: No P2W, FAST combat, few maps/servers, minor graphical/translation issues

    I just want to point out a few things. The download size is small, a few GB, so you can quickly try it out for yourself. At the moment, the game isn't P2W. You get a daily login bonus of in-game currency, which lets you buy any weapon when you can afford it. There is also a ""FREE"" DLC that gives you every gun for free to try out for 15 days. Lastly, It seems the devs are doing their best to keep the minimum system requirement low so they get the largest playerbase possible.

    The combat is a good mix between CS:GO and earlier COD games. At the moment, all weapons are fast and accurate, you can ADS, and there isn't much of a penalty for moving while shooting. There is a high emphasis on skill and smart plays. I wont elaborate too much because all of this can change.

    From what Ican gather, this game has been out for a few years and is just now coming to steam. There are grammer mistakes and minor graphical errors (The UAV flies through buildings in some maps), but I hope these get ironed out at some point. The game is considered to be in early access, so only time will tell if things pan out favorably."
23972,little bugy but relly fun gun kinda cod :D relly good game i hope more free stuff :D
23973,"A good F2P shooter. Havent encountered any bugs, pings are generally lowish (EU) and very easy to run graphics wise despite looking good."
23974,Great game. Very fun
23975,"Would be pretty cool if the play button actually did what its saying it will. Wont launch and keeps shutting down. Would nominate for the ""So close but yet so shitty"" award 4sure."
23976,"Good,fun fps game that is F2P and u rarely find that these days."
23977,"Fun game with nice graphics, easy to understand gameplay, mechanics are above average, although the de-sync on servers could use a touch up but none the less a great game in my books."
23978,"One of the best fps game i played so far.
How people say this game is pay to win
you can get what ever weppon you want
in very easy ways
you dont need to open a loot box because skins are just cosmatics and nothing else
this game is no pay 2 win at all!!!"
23979,i really loveeeeeee this game they just have to make it easier to see the enemy and it would be good so far this game is good as fuck! 10/10 everyone should play it <3 !
23980,"Its a pretty solid game for EA. Not pay2win, at least right now it isn't. Feels like a more balanced Combat Arms with less pay2win mechanics, and less hackers. So pretty fun."
23981,its okay
23982,"its a great game, its no call of duty but if its a free, realistic shooter, i like it

game does crash from time to time so please take the time to fix that."
23983,"The people giving it negative reviews right now are all mad because the server is having issues, but what game HASN'T had server issues at launch in the last 5 years? Stay mad, kids.

This game is an excellent shooter and (assuming it remains the way it is) has the best f2p business model I've ever seen; 90% of guns are purchasable without spending a dime, and the ""grind"" to unlock weapons, well it's not really a grind, the game starts you with enough money to buy 2 of them right off the bat, 3 guns are given to you for free, and still if you want more weapons you can grind one out by just logging in for 6-8 days literally not even requiring you to play the game.

How do the developers make money? Well they sell cosmetic skins for the weapons as well as lootboxes which also include purely cosmetic items.

There ARE negatives to this game though:
-Very few maps, many of which are uninspired and some of which are fairly unbalanced
-No FFA mode
-No toggle-crouch option

I know those cons are nit-picky, but every game has its flaws and this game (especially to be a f2p) has very few.

8/10

TAC RELOAD!"
23984,"For all of those stating that it crashes on startup and immediately giving it a thumbs down:
I started playing this game a few days ago and purchased the founders pack to support the developers. One of the first shooters that I've played (besides cs:go) that is not pay 2 win. The game has not crashed once for me and for several others. The game is very active, lots of clans based in several different regions. Also, remember that the game is in early access.

Cons:
Not pay 2 win
Active community
Developers are working constantly on the game
Anti-cheat system works

So far, I haven't found any drawbacks to the game, it still is in it's first few days of being active. They are in the process of making a ranked system.
For those giving it a thumbs down, try to troubleshoot before reviewing instantly.
Also, for those not giving this game a try just because of those people with thumbs down reviews. Look at their hours, they have under an hour of playtime and immediately gave up. Look at those with thumbs up, they have over an hour of playtime.
Try this game."
23985,"It's F2P, not a bad little game if you wanna run and gun it."
23986,"This game is awesome!

The gameplay feels very smooth, It's a nice game to play competitive with your friend. You need to play together with ur team in other to win. Just try it for yourself."
23987,Dear developers make the Russian language please the game as a whole is good and the graphics are excellent but there is no Russian language please correct this in the most updated update thanks with respect pashok
23988,"Generic free2play shooter, like everything else you already saw before with no inspiration behind it.

The shooting is very arcade, to the point of being able to hold down the fire button with a light machine gun and your aim barely moves. Also includes a lot of one shot weapons with perfect precision.

The game pretend it has classes, but it boils down to what killing spree bonus you will get in the match, it has no effect at all on what equipment you can or cannot use."
23989,"This F2P FPS is (in my opinion) one of the best Free to play game out there. It has a fast time to kill (2-3 bullets and you drop) NO P2W at all! Guns are really easy to get and I like the map layouts. Graphics are beautiful and the game runs as smooth as a baby's bum :)
I recommend this Game!!
9.5/10

My only complaint so far is that you can't toggle if you coose to hold the RMB to aim, It's only toggle aim right now."
23990,"Very bad, server dont work when you want to play."
23991,Amazing realistic and fun gameplay
23992,"I hope to have more sea server pls,
I have to play sever US with ping >300"
23993,no option to change run to shift instead of middle mouse click? wut
23994,"It's weird, but it has potential.

Imagine CSGO, CoD and Battlefield thrown into a blender, and that's what the game is like."
23995,-
23996,the over all game play is good and fun but it is pretty glitchy but other than that its a great game i just wish there were more maps
23997,"fun
"
23998,BUGGY as shit
23999,HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND DEVS DONT DO S**T ABOUT IT!!!!
24000,"nice game,i like it but giving some problem i hope its will be solve."
24001,"Hello! I know i havent put much time in the game, but ive played dozens of f2p fps like this. it bring me back to the old days when i was a 13 yr old s**thead talking smack to everyone. the game looks great plays great and  im sure the clan matches will be fun and competitive too. just gotta get through a few hiccups and be patient and im sure the dev team will come through!  thumbs up in my book"
24002,I definitely recommend it. thats it. thats all i gotta say.
24003,"You know the scenes in movies where they try to show someone playing a shooter, and its this over-the-top, over-enthusiastic piece of garbage? Yea, its that. Run around hip fire with LMG's or Shotguns and attach a laser site. No point in using anything else"
24004,This Is Very Good! Ignore Bad Reviews There Only Lies Because The Servers Go Down Frequently Keep In Mind Its In Alpha ''That Happens''
24005,broken as af menus arent working cant even start a match
24006,the gore is so good omg is a good game
24007,"This game is shit.It always chrashes.Server is down all the time,sometimes u can't even start it....
"
24008,started game up and it looked amazing for a F2P game played through the tutorial and was really hyped to play online then it crashed.....then crashed again......then froze then i uninstalled might try again in a month or 2
24009,"Plays like a F2P shooter from the early 2000's.

I don't recommend it."
24010,"This Game makes a lot of Fun but i can´t open the Shop,After EVERY Round i can´t do ANYTHING. PS: i played 2 rounds because the game don´t start."
24011,Comepleted tutorial and tried to play team deathmatch but it just stays stuck on a screen and i cant click anything but stuff still moves wtf
24012,"why do people reccomending this? servers are almost always down, even if they are online, u gotta wait 10 mins because there arent many servers and u get in queue... graphics, sound effects and physics are nice though"
24013,The menu first starting off is actual shit
24014,Great game but when nobodys playing it gets boring. If we can get more people to play it will be better.
24015,"Blackscreen Simulator 2017
10/10 would play again"
24016,"Mix of good old Arctic Combat and Warface, no p2w, just some cosmetic, which is so expensive. Mechanics are easy, game runs smoothly and you can shoot, jump, and run in the same time, and yes, crouch!"
24017,"~ DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT DOWNLOADING THIS ~
This is the worst experience I've had with a f2p game. EVER.
The tutorial was a pain. I had to do exactly what it said, and all that while I couldn't use push-to-talk on discord because the game was running in administrator mode, and the SETTINGS were disabled?!?! In the tutorial I wasn't able to get rid of the full screen or MUTE THE DAMN ♥♥♥♥♥♥ SOUND. Gunshots were making my ears bleed.. I muted the entire pc to get a little silence. After I finished the crappiest tutorial ever I wasn't able to connect to a server, the game froze, next time I open it it was BLACK, I tried again, it worked 10 seconds and froze again. I tried ONCE AGAIN AND FOR THE LAST TIME AND GUESS WHAT, it told me I was logged in already (I checked and there was no process left from the last time I closed the game).
I uninstalled it with no regret, it was so bad that I had to write this review."
24018,"Pros:
Good graphics
Good effects and smooth gaming
SOLID fps (not gpu consuming)
Need not to spend extra money on scope and sliencer
Easy to play, relaxing and fun

Cons:
There are only 3 servers (NA, EU, SA) but that's kinda acceptable since it's only an early access game.
Hip firing is too powerful in this game
But this game is for FREE b1tch, what do you expect?

Hopefully they will add more servers like ASIA servers in the future.

10/10 would recommend if you wanna play a less-competitive game."
24019,"This game is awesome for a f2p, I would rate it as a 7/10.
But... Why not 10?
There are some aspects of this game that makes me give a 7.
The game has a lot of bugs on main screen where you have your inventory etc... The bug basically doesn't let you do anything, it's like your screen is frozen.
There's also a bug which happens when you close the game without using the quit button inside the game ( just go on taskbar and close it ) which makes you unable to log in the game for the next 5 minutes or more, saying that the account is already logged on, which is kinda sad, happened to me twice today after the SCREEN WAS FROZEN, and it happened to my friend as well.

The game is kinda like rainbow siege, you have different game modes, but what it lacks is actually a competitive game mode, ( like cs:go) which places you in a rank, otherwise, there will be no objective besides clans and lvl up.
The games graphics are good enough for a f2p, and what I really like about the game is that it isn't P2W, what you see in cashshop is normally SKINS, those weapons  are normally sold for medals , ( weapons like AK-47, p90, deagle, ACR-GL, etc... )

The game also has chests where you can try your luck and get weapons and other items.
It also gets updates atleast once a month, which isn't bad.
You can also have your own clan, or join one. ( means that you do not have to play alone )

One thing that I really think the game lacks, is COMMUNICATION.
yes communication, why? A voice chat would be great for games like this, only chat isn't that effective when you're playing with strangers, or any senario like that.

For a f2p, I completely recommend this game.

7/10"
24020,"A few critical problems with this game. Hit detection is off by quite a bit. Headshots seem random, you can use a machine gun and shoot at someone's head at point blank, and the first 20 shots don't headshot, but the 21st one does. Maybe try later, but now it's not so good."

24024,https://steamcommunity.com/app/550650/discussions/0/1850323802574319946/
24025,"Not a bad FPS game for an Early Access title but the bugs need to be dealt with, a sprint button added, and the maps/spawn areas need to be re-designed because it's too easy for me to get in and do a bit of spawnkilling.
I had trouble navigating the menus because either I get a black screen at the start, or I an't press anything because of the aformentioned bugs. In the end, don't expect anything spectacular out of this game, it feels more like pure, casual fun at most but that's not necessarily a bad thing and this game offers that kind of fun I've been looking for in a long time; if one is not busy playing the more hardcore shooters."

24032,"Another 'Call of Duty' multiplayer experience, but with a nice style classic of 'Neowiz' (Korean Company) and a decent paint job using the Unreal Engine 3. Plus it's free to play, has dedicated servers and for the looks of it (at least for now) it's not P2W. Give it a try!"
24033,"Id rather not play this again maybe with friends it will be better but you can still be killed by one guy running a shotgun 
So the game sure looks good but you dont really have to aim in this game most people dont even use the scope 
The fucking shotguns are good in mid range and close range why in mid range tho it takes you 2 shots to kill someone in mid range and it makes it the perfect weapon to defend with or just rush with i just saw one guy rushing killing me first then 3 of my teammates the smoke doesnt really work it doesnt last long enough and im pretty sure if you try hard you can see through it the snipers are not bad but the reason is that you dont really need aim idk whats with the hit box but i just see people shooting and missing well what it looked like they have missed but they land a shot and kill the guy i really get pissed about that 
tbh it would be a great game if they fix the shotgun the hitboxes the smoke has to be better and if they can add other stuff like mustard gas yknow flashbang somethin like that it would be cool but if you dont like what youve read so far dont play if y wanna try it out im just saying what i think about the game have a good day :) ."
24034,"This is like a game about menus! I say that, because I couldn't atually start the game in anyway except for playing a tutorial. None of the buttons to launch the game seemed to work. If I wanted to click like crazy to get things done, I'd play Adventure Capitalist."
24035,Verry good game only thing they should change is that you can chose or unlock attatchments for the weapons now they have a specisfic attatchment each gun and some of them just dont fit the gun
24036,"Start game, Logged in , Clicked random box icon , Game frozen, Restarted game  then it says i cant play because  im logged. Game is broken as of the date of this review. Wait till release."
24037,"If you are looking for a new FPS F2P game, this is the right game to try out.

its alot of fun"

24040,"Actually nothing works, you try to launch the tutorial and nothing happens. inbox freezez game and when trying to launch it back up black screens and never comes out. dont waste your space.
You literally cant even play the game these reviews are all fake dont believe a word."
24041,"If you enjoy running around a small map around the size of rust from MW2. Or you like running around a corner only to get killed most of the time then this game is for you. Its just cs:go with aiming and smaller maps.
4/10"
24042,The Game is Decent. ☺
24043,"At first would not let me do ANYTHING except complete the tutorial but the game would not let me in the tutorial. No matter how many times I clicked confirm, the tutorial would not launch. I then restarted the game and was met with an instant crash. Then on my third run, the entire screen remained black and did absolutely nothing (had to force close). And finally, it gave me an error stating that my account was already logged in. Legit managed to give me four different reasons of failure each fucking time I opened the damn game."
24044,Amazing game so far. not pay to win at all. the game is very fast paced and is a very hard core modern day fps.  as or right now shotguns are op but other than that the game runs perfectly and is optimized very well.
24045,"the game is good 
but need fix 1- black screen 2- green screen 3- can't join servers 
thx for this game it's vrey good 
can you but the arbic lug"

24047,good game but not enough players in sea server sadly
24048,"So far so bad.

Grenade spam
Confusing interface
Boring as hell
Bad weapon handling
etc.

although it has good optimization... but not nice looking graphics"
24049,"Though this will be a game worth giving a try,because of the positive reviews,I was wrong,game is shit,menu is broken,you can't even get into the game,because no matter how hard you try to click to find a game,it just wont,no matter how many times you restart the game it doesn't fix."
24050,"[h1]Black Squad Review[/h1]

At first I hadn't much hopes on the game. It seemed sluggish a bit and seemed like another of those f2p that come to be actually p2w. But guess what... [spoiler]Its not.[/spoiler]

The game is smooth, with good graphics. It has great response time and some variety in gamemodes that can entertain someone for a long period of time during the day.

It also of course is worth to mention the fact that it is in early access and that I'm positive it will come to have much more to complement to what I already think it's a good game overall.

-TL:DR-
Pros:
 - Great Performance;
 - Good graphics (although less important to me anyway);
 - Fun game mechanics;
 - Some variety in gamemodes;
 - BADASS TUTORIAL;

Cons:
 - Weapons a bit overpriced considering what you gain with each map;
 - UI in main menu is a bit confusing at first;
 - No Half-Life 3

fast pace
fun
good graphics
guns seem balanced
good for crappy pcs (WELL IT WORKED FOR MY FRIEND)
i dont want to bore with a 10 page list some ima skip to the cons

                                  -CONS-
maps are a little small like in the maps i have played it all goes the same way there are 3 mids and you rush down one of them to flank them to get alot of kills


so in the end this a great game and hopfully it comes with more great content!"

24064,"A Review From Kickassman3. 


PROS: Honestly if you can't afford Counter Strike or you want to play a good F2P game like it is given this game is it. 

The gameplay is fun and a great introduction to the game. It has Realitvly good Graphics and a good F2P shooter. 
I Personally Enjoy the game and how competitive it feels. Personally I'm not a competitive player But this is a game everyone should get and you should get this game. 

I personally love the Variety of Guns they have, its quite small but i'm sure it will largen over the time of playing. 
Plus the Community really doesn't rage as much as I expected, I do have a few Cons so be prepared my Fellow players. 
But with all in reality I actually enjoy this game completely I am glad and proud to have this game in my list. 


CONS  (Get Ready) 

Personally Even though I adore this game and its actually quite fun. ITs a bunch of Bullshit. 

I personally think there must be some Register problems because it takes literally 4 - 6 Bullets for me personally to down an Opponent. The Snipers are exactly how Counter Strike is, But given that this is infact a Free to play game, I can't say to much bad things about this game cause I am indeed impressed, Though I don't appreciate that I can't or its rare at each round is so Fast pace I can't determain if I got a kill or not. Cause if you want a Fast pace game you gotta at least make it where killing your Enemy is quick. 

ALSO the Spawn Camping. . . THAT is literally the biggest bull crap stratagy in the game, Sure you get a breif invincability but the player should NOT even be allowed to go into the Enemies Spawn period. Its unsportsmenship. I still have to suggest this game because its a fun game don't get me wrong, But it does Anger me the Heck off when I KNOW i should of got that fricken kill. But putting in 4 hits in the character and he is not down, is a bunch of bull Crap and my Internet is great it gives me about 40 - 120 Ping. Not the greatest BUT still good enough to play Online gaming. I sure HELL can tell you that you will Rage at this game, Cause Honestly My Assumption and this is only just a Hunch and I don't usually do this, But Modders are more likely Infected this game or (Hackers) for you stupid kids that think that ""Hackers"" I don't Assume this and Dont' take my word for it, But the amount of kills that some players get are insane even for the limit.
Some even go 145 - 20 To be fair. I understand this is a Fast pace game, Though the hit Regiestering is really Terrible, Cause I am not that terrible at a game and Its not Rocket Science and sure some of these players are good, But I suspect them to be a little too good if you catch my drift. But I would expect that this game would not have some Hit Registering could be a bit Fixed?? 

But this is a Small review of course and FyI 

(For those who think ""Hackers"" are a Huge thing, Hackers are 100x worse than Modders. ) 

Modders are the ones you notice that go on like 500+ Kill streak and not even give you the chance to even spawn or when you do spawn it instantly Kills you. That is a Modder Not a Hacker. 

A Hacker is someone that goes deep in the coding of the game itself, Hacking you, Your information, The companies Information and so forth, I really am trying to get those people that assume ""hackers"" are what makes games terrible and your not wrong, I can't say that they are good people since they ruin the fun of the game cause they are no good. 

But in all actuality I think that this game has some Flaws that they ""Need"" Or suggest that should be fixed. Cause the amount of problems that i've been having its not noticable But when I die constantly when I can even get a Recording at what the Hit Ratio is, Its terrible cause I know I get at LEAST 4 bullets in the guys chest and if they are wearing a Better Vest than me, I rather know that because I am fairly new. But I judge games hardcore if they arn't fun or they are a terrible game. 

But in all actuality I think that this game you should play if you have the free time to play because 1 its Free and 2 Its good to see other players support the gaming community by downloading this game from the developers so they could further improve it. But of course this is just a simple ""complaint"" But at the same time a Review. 


So lets Recap. 

#1 Its a great game, I think you all should buy it. 

#2 The game isn't that great, But its a great Pass timer game.

#3 Its Really competitve and a good Some are playing the game. 

#4 I think that the registeration of the ""Bullets"" should Kill much Quicker in my opinion. 
I don't think its really fair that others are able to Kill me personally SO unbelievably quick. 

#5. Have fun, Play the game and most of all, ""This is Kickassman3 Review"" Have fun out their players."
24065,I LOVE THIS GAME! THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME BUT THIS IS ALWAYS HAVE A MAINTENANCE
24066,"really nice geam, but is it beta? alpha? or under maintenance?"

24068,"Discord Rasicm!
I was muted on there Discord because I said I think the servers are♥♥♥♥♥♥ I then got unmuted and then they banned me! 

#FreeKyle #NoJustice


Worst Devs EU. Moderators are♥♥♥♥♥♥ They can't even handle there Discord. 

They told us to be patient but everyone just laughted. Then they had a bot saying the servers are back up but they weren't HAHA uninstalled!


DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME! THE DEVS DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR OPINION!"
24069,nice f2p game. mischung aus cod und cs go. geile hitbox
24070,"Soon there will be a year as I play this game and I was disappointed in how the game is being killed by cheaters. Defense is not developed, and cheaters are becoming more and more. Instead of protection, developers add skins. Well, it is understandable - the main profit."
24071,nah fam
24072,"Pros: Free game excellent graphic.
No pay to win
Potato pc can run smooth
"
24073,doesn't work awful
24074,"Played tutorial and it was promising fun looking game, after tutorial i tried to get into game but wasnt able to because games crashed, after 15 times restarting game it finally opened without black screen and immidiately crashed again when tried to play. black sreens here we go again... my intrest died. im done with this game"
24075,"1. The game currently has shit net coding which can mostly be fixed by adding more servers and/or create a smart matchmaking system with a pinglimiter so be prepared to play  against 200+ mostly 300+ pingers which consist of one third of the enemy team.

2. The maps are 6.5/10 but if you like call of duty you won't have a problem here.

3. The weapons are cheap, easy enough to earn enough currency to buy any PERMANENT weapon.

4. The aiming system is garbage, I could right-click once and go epileptic because it would flicker in and out 3 times and then I would die because of it. After 2 hours of playing I finally found under options/gameplay/other the hold-to-aim option which fixed it but the aiming still feels very stiff.

5. I almost uninstalled because of the broken mouse sensitivity. I expect my in-game mouse sensitivity to be ""normal"" like in any other FPS game. I had to change it from 5 to 15! I shouldn't have to move my mouse off the table onto the wall for half a meter (I have a good laser mouse) just to finish the tutorial where I almost died getting shot in the back *facepalm*

6. And hitreg is also shit, I could randomly shoot around a guy and somehow hit him twice and he had around 80 ping.

7. It runs on a potato with a GPU that was already seen as mediocre in 2012 with 60+ fps in 1680x1050 so that's great!

Even with the few negative things in the game, it is currently (to my knowledge) by far the best free FPS out there.

24076,paska peli ei ees pääse peliin
24077,CANT JOING THE FU**ING LOBBY 10/10 would uninstall
24078,"Even in Early Access game is super optimised .
Expect 100 fps + even on potato PC .
This game is great reminds me a lot of AVA in its glory days .
Weapons feel powerfull with nice recoil , there is no Pay to win in any form .
Install STFU and play because right now there is no better F2P shooter on the PC"
24079,"too many hacker in this game,please ban those fucking hacker"
24080,"It's like someone tried to make Tom Clancy's Counter Strike: Battlefield 4. You have to run with your knife out and plant c4 and shit. Voice acting is absolute anus shit. Gunplay is alright I guess, overall I don't like this game. It's basically a stereotypical FPS game for poor people."
24081,"Worst game i ever seen as Free 2 Play. First i install it that goes well then when i come to main menu it begins to hang and freeze and so on so i restart and try again same shit still so i restart again and after few restarts it started to say ""This player is already logged in [5][4]"" which is completely lame and even tutorial does not work even game mention rewards if you play it. Since you press tutorial and it says do i wanna play tutorial? i click confirm box closes nothing happens and if i click it again same box comes up and does nothing again and then menu freezes nothing is click able after. This game needs huge fix before it will get any possitive & recommendation from tons of people. So for now stay away and wait for devs to improve it first before you even try game since now it's not even worth it."
24082,givin it a chance.
24083,"I like the fact that even though the game is in early access you can see that it is almost a fully completed product, all it needs to become a great game is more variety in the ingame store. Evemn though there is ingame currency wich can be bought with irl money, theres is still a lot of ballence in the scense that grinding for credits and medals in the game was made an enjoiable and fun experience"
24084,"If you try this game, you wont be able to stop playing it.Its my experience"
24085,I tried playing this game again after a break and turns out I'm banned.
24086,my fav games fps
24087,Doesnt work.
24088,It's a good free cod-like shooter
24089,"Seems like it has potential, unfortunately I have not even been able to load into the game and have experienced around 10 crashes. Maybe it will get better but as of right now I would not recommend this game.

EDIT: I have found out to fix the crash when you press confirm, switch to the NA server, the point still stands however, fix the ""player is already logged in"" crash!

EDIT 2: After playing 1 match I must say, the game is incredibly fun and so I'm changing my review to recommended but I still hope you will fix these issues."
24090,Black Squad?! More like Blackscreen
24091,<3
24092,"white squad
"
24093,"This game is amazing. The game isn't P2W which is refreshing feeling since most F2P FPS are P2W. This game feels like as if CS:GO and COD had a baby and the baby was Black Squad. I highly reccommend this game to FPS fans.

Also ignore the bad reviews since they are not well written."
24094,nice game
24095,"In 8 minutes of playing I found 3 bugs!
- After I finished the tutorial, I opened the inbox, and the game simply stucked at loading the inbox
- After that, I needed to quit, and when I entered in the game again, boom, black screen!
- After many times of trying to enter the game, I received the error that I am already logged in in tha game! 
WOOOW!"
24096,"The game looked cool.

I installed it.

Entered my player name.

Game crashed.

Restarted game with the message ""Player Already Logged In"" 

Window Closes automatically

Cant even play the game.

0/10

"
24097,This game is just not good in it's current state. The game would crash when trying to do simple things like change it to windowed mode. It struggled to let me do anything. I do not recommend this game maybe when it's finished but right now it is garbage.
24098,"The game is quite solid. The bullet impact is satifying and the movement aswell. The couple things that need to be addressed, EVGA Presision XOC isn't showing up in game as well as the Nvidia FPS counter. Also, the hold Aim Down Sights isn't working. I've tried both options and it's only doing toggle, witch is throwing me off. But other than that. Its a game to play."
24099,Quick que times and is a blast to play!
24100,"If you like games with nothing but laggy ass south americans, guns with no recoil, people shooting any where and getting kills, rifle laser sights that extend infinitely and make it impossible to tell friend from foe, pistols that are as good and better than rifles then this is your game."
24101,"played 40mins of the game. Fun for 10 minutes, 30 minutes of why would anybody play this game.

3/33 good thing its free"
24102,"If COD 4 was made to run on cell phones, it still wouldnt be as bad as this"
24103,Really good game !!
24104,"shit game, feels like every f2p game"
24105,The game just came out and there are already hackers. plz dont play
24106,"Shotguns 1 hit from everywhere, snipers 1 hit from everywhere, constant nade spam. This game is trash."
24107,"Its basic f2p fps games. It was long time ago i didn't play games like this and i really enjoy it. 

Pros:
Weapons are permanent, so you don't need buy weapon for seven days.
F2P but not P2W
The shots when you hitting an enemmy is awesome. (But this should be only for head because its boring over a time)
Cool weapon system
Sniper system that was one thing i love. It's old games and thats why i loved this game. Of course its early access they will improve it.

Cons:
The sounds when youre hitting are too head fucker. Instead of the sound when you hit enemy whatever you want should be only for head. Becaause then its feel very good.
Weapons are  not unbalanced. I mean you can't kill player with secondary weapon one shot. 
Bomb hitboxes are crap.
Bomb timing are also trash it takes 3 seconds to bomb. 3 seconds everyone can run from it"
24108,"Only been playing TDM so far, but it's pretty good. My main concern is the lack of Asia servers, forcing me ( and other people I've noticed ) to play with at least 200ms in NA."
24109,The most clunky and irritating fps game i've ever played -10/10
24110,reminds me of cs
24111,Fun game
24112,Nice but where is the Gamepad support?????????????????????????
24113,"Let me start off with this
this game has some issues 
but.....
it's a very solid fps with good mehanics and very solid gunplay
Great graphics even on low 
It's also very well optimized
Just add more sidearms and more shotguns
Also buff shotguns a little bit


Still a great game thoe"
24114,Controls and overall system isn't intuitive and strays away from the normal conrols used. Maps are small and just involve people shooting from their spawn. Time to unlock actual things from the gains is far too long and limits players.
24115,"Thanks, i needed to waste 5GB of data, Do yourself a favor and buy Rainbow Six: Siege."
24116,"Great and Fair game, i surely reccomend."
24117,No
24118,Download it its free
24119,"I can't even tell exactly I am hyped for this game. After playing it out for a bit, I experienced the amazing graphics, the mechanics and overall fast paced combat. The only thing I can ever state out as a negative trait is the size of the maps. They are mainly made for very quick paced close quarters combat. They are really small, but have a lot of pathways inside them that kinda dissipates the small size of the maps.

I really hope developers continue with this system and do not create a P2W game in future. Currently, even in this state, it is a mindblowing and VERY addictive game. I am actually considering to move to this game from CS:GO(very toxic community with insane amount of bugs). The mechanics are quite similar too, you have accerelation based movement unlike in games like Overwatch.

All of this, I rate 10/10."
24120,Epic Games !!!
24121,"Hey i got a friend who want to download the game but when he download it ,sais that has 100mb and when he try to enter in the game got a missing file can u help me ?
"
24122,"The game doesn't really push a new concept. in the matter of fact, it's just kind of boring. The gunplay isn't very exciting and the gameplay overall isn't something special."
24123,This game gives point & click adventures a whole new meaning.
24124,"First impressions: Bought a box that ""contains a permanent item"", got 3-day smoke grenades. Tried again, got 3-day smoke grenades. I don't know how to use smoke grenades. Maps are all the size of Rust from MW2. Assault Rifles kill in 2-3 bullets. Sniper Rifles and Shotguns kill in 2-3 bullets.  Finished a match where the top player went 15-20. Graphics are bad. I like the gun variety."
24125,"it is F2P, so i wasnt expect much from it. Its pretty much like CrossFire, SoldierFront kinda game...

Pro:
- free game
- descent graphics
- great weaponary choices for player

Con:
- pretty big file for a game like this, CSGO has about the same size
- hit registering is really bad, might be server issue what not."
24126,"The game is great, I have the graphics on medium/low and It looks great while going with 60 fps. The only thing that needs fixing is the ragdoll physics after you die, other than that It's a great game with a lot of potential to become better."
24127,Eh.
24128,6/10
24129,"Guns feel like they came from an M9K addon from Garry's mod, but that's not a bad thing. I kinda like it that way."
24130,"Black Squad is really fun and addictive. Few pointers to point out here. For those that are considering to download and try for yourself.
-This does not have an Asia / SEA server as of the time i am writing this review. (Only has NA/SA/EU server)
-Hit registry kind of sucks for me. ( Most probably cause im from Singapore. Thus the 200+ ping really sucks )
-In game weapons are permanent. However the nicer, more badass looking ones cost money. (Skin guns)
-This game has a very familiar feel to if you have played Sudden Attack, AVA, Blackshot, CS. (Very easy to pick up)

Overall, is a game worth playing. However would really hope they add in SEA/Asia server soon. 
"
24131,"Pretty fun so far, a pretty good game with some decent gun plays, however I feel that the sprint function is clunky, isn't it just possible to add sprint on guns as well? When you sprint you can only do so by pressing the Middle mouse button and switches to your knife, might be a balancing/tactical feature but I can't help and find it weird.

Also, this game desperately needs a Asia server. At the moment there's only US, EU and South America, I understand that's it has only launch but please add one to Asia, I can't bear to play 300 ping."
24132,very good game
24133,nice game
24134,TACTICAL RELOAD!
24135,"I only played this game for abit and in this time have really enjoyed myself. However only thing that needs to be improved is balancing of snipers as to me they are mostly op, however this is still early access game and it is going in the right direction to be an amazing game."
24136,Great Overall Game
24137,"Great game, gud to play with freinds. Only complain is  that the snipers need to be nerfed. All guns take quite a few shots to kill someone, where as the sniper is mostly a 1 hit kill."
24138,"Solid fps but needs a server browser and ping limit.

TAC RELOAD"
24139,Pretty gud
24140,"Clunky movement, bad gunplay basically it's a poor CSGO copy, played one match and uninstalled it spent more time downloading it than I did playing. Save yourself the trouble and avoid."
24141,Pretty good game rn
24142,"its a really nice shooter game wich emphasizes both movement and gunplay.
The game gives you just enough money to spend in any weapon you'd like and after that purchase you can grind your next weapon through matches and such. The matches ive gon into were'nt too unbalanced.
There WILL be spawntrapping but keep in mind that the most unbalanced match i got into had a difference between 30-20 points/kills wich is nothing in comparison to valve's ""glorious"" matchmaking system."
24143,"[h1][b]10/10[/b][/h1]
This game is better than most played free fps(TF2) and most played paid fps(CS:GO).
This game have everything that both don't have, such as aimdown sight,weapons update,super graphics and even more!
In CS:GO you spent money on opening cases.In this game you spent money on new guns with cool skins.

Play this game instead."
24144,Just like every other run-of-the-mill dime a dozen free to play FPS game that always claims they bring something new to the table when they really don't.
24145,"It feels like skill isn't that big of a deal in this game. 
You can just oneshot with the shotgun or try to kill a guy just to be killed by the next one. It's impossible to kill two guys or three guys in one go even if you headshot 2 times somebody (possible with the shotgun, ofc). They won't die and they will kill you. The only way to play this game is through tactics, but even then, it feels like you can't do much even though you have a good aim."
24146,A good free to play
24147,Was okay in the beginning. Now its just repetitive shit game which will die soon
24148,not bad fam xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
24149,amazing game 11/10
24150,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU ARE IN AUSTRALIA OR NEW ZEALAND!
I downloaded did the training then there was no servers I could play on only EU, NA and SA at best I'd get 200 ping."
24151,"Horrible English translation, mediocre game play.  Feels like every other COD/BF clone out there, and does absolutely nothing even remotely new and interesting.  I had a fair amount of lag during close encounters despite their ""amazing"" netcode.  It's not the worst free game I've tried, but I have no interest in playing it again."
24152,Just awful
24153,Average free-to-play shooter game...

24155,"stupid RNG boxes gimmick to rip off your monies, it ruin the game

Not recommended !"
24156,Meh
24157,This game like CS GO + Black ops = black squad......... GG ... but this for free :D
24158,It's pretty gud.
24159,"One of the funniest FPS have ever played. Alone or with your friend (it's better, like every FPS), you'll have some fun on this game, there is a lot of mode, lot of weapon, it's a immersive and intuitive gameplay. Except if you have a wooden PC you can play FULL-graphics (GTX750ti, i7 4.2ghz, 8go ram = 120fps ~)

Good points:

- A large kind of choice for weapons, 
- The gameplay is easy to undestand,
- Graphics are correct,
- The hitbox are correct aswell,
- There is no lag compensation, that's perfect !
- Pings are low (except ofc if you're from EU and you go on US Server..)
- The matchmaking works verywell, not a long time before finding a game.
- The community, for what Ive seen for now, it's a good one. 
- No cheat for now, I mean, I didnt see once until now (20 hours in record)

Bad points:

- In demolition mode 5v5/8v8, when someone is afk, he's not kick out until he left the game by himself,
- Still in Demo, too much ppl are leaving the game because they know there is no sanctions, no penalties. That's really bad.
- Another point, if someone is writting something in tchat (informations about ennemies, bomb etc..) sometime it wont be showed to the lasts standing alives.
- Sometime, we started the game at 4 vs 5. The MM should find a 5th before launch the game. So you must add a warmup (like 40 seconds or something like that, except if every ppl is on the server).
- Sounds like steps, bomb plant, must be review, it's a little bit too high. Too easy to spot ennemies even they're far away from us.


Well, I know it's only an Early Access, but if you can change every bad thing I wrote up, it will be a very good point for the game and the community. Anyway, for an Early Access, I'll give a thumbs up for this game ! And I'll keep playing on it.

Thx the devs, 

Ps: I love you Clare ! Marry me ! :D"
24160,"interesting game to play.
Accurate hipfire with easier recoil than csgo makes it fun to play on a casual basis"
24161,The game is a good time killer fps. Although i wouldn't know because i have two hours played but I've spent the whole 2 hours stuck on the main menu. TAC RELOAD!
24162,Pretty fun game. Definitly recommend if you like shooters.
24163,"Black Squad is like a CounterStrike Clone.
The Gamemode with 2 Bombs and Defuser looks like Counterstrike.

+ Its Free 2 Play and everybody can try it out.
+ You can play it with every potato PC.
+ My Favorite Game Mode is the ""Battle Mode"" where you are instant rewarded with points which you can invest in ""airstrike"" and ""artillery support"", ""Claymore Mines"" and stuff like that.

- Devs invested not much to improve Sounds and Physics.
- The fast gameplay feels like ""Jump and Run"" and makes the whole game less interesting for tactical interested players
- There is no Voice Chat. So coordinated teamwork is very difficult."
24164,"one quite bad excuse for a fps game..slow, laggy, with lots of JFK style ""Magic Bullets"" moments..not worth my time.."
24165," ,."
24166,WOW THIS GAME GIVE MORE THAN U EXPECT
24167,"Overall rating 7/10

Kind of like Warface (But better) mixed in with a tiny bit of CS:GO
I would recommend this game because it's fun, free, and isn't pay to win. You can practically buy any gun right at the start of the game.
It doesn't require much to run it. And if you can't run it. Get a better graphics card. I can run this perfectly on Intel integrated.
"
24168,Good Game but can you Pls make a Oceania Sever.
24169,"Please give Asians a server.  This game is fun as hell but their 300 pings to NA because they don't have a server in their region is annoying as fuck.

Only NA, EU and SA."
24170,You shoot enemy and enemy die.
24171,"the game is really fast and actully looks better then i expected the veraity is kindda limited but at the start they give you enough money to buy 2 guns
"
24172,"I played alot free 2 play shooter games but this one is Skill vs Skill Game no pay2win! You can buy all weapons with gold the regular ingame curency and when you install the dlc you can test out weapons for 15 days befor buy one the only cash part of the game is visual skins ... And the best of the game is the lobbys are servers and not player hosted so you always have nice ping .
Pro 
#nice server latency 
#fast game search in all modes 
#alot of weapons 
#cheap real cash boxes compared to other games (TF2,CSGO)
#always fun playing some rounds dont feel like i got killed by cheaters 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Con
#the real cash boxes has low drop chance on weapon skins 
#some maps in teamdeathmatch need a rebalance like the cargo map (the top spot and both side ways should be equal)
#sometimes in bomb mode you play with randoms vs a full squad of people thats inbalance on its finest and should get fixed !
but its early access so letz wait what will come to the future 
but for now i can recommand the game"
24173,"There is now at least one or two cheater per game in ranked (lion/cobra), it's just unplayable, how can you enjoy a game when there is so much cheaters, they still did nothing about it, and i dont think they will. Game was good 2yrs ago, now it's done. Hit me up when another f2p fps comes out.

ps: been playing fps for about 5yrs i know what cheating is, i am able to recognize them."
24174,"Painfully generic, basically just feels like another run of the mill Korean F2P shooter."
24175,"Mix between Call Of Duty and Counter-Strike in away. 
"
24176,not pay to win game.a good free fps game.and hope you guys fix asian server as well.overall 8/10.
24177,Really boring pretty much an AVA clone. Easy to get spawn killed and the game lagged like crazy. Worst thing is takes pretty much a whole clip to kill someone when it seems like one shot you get killed even from a handgun. Not what I expected and the game feels really dated like it came from 2000. It feels like a fast pace arcade type shooter. I know its early access but to me the game doesn't seem like it will improve enough to ever be worth any type of money. Just so much missing from the game that makes it unbalanced. I'll be happy to uninstall and forget all about it.
24178,"The game is fun, fast paced action. The maps are laid out great. Lots of different weapons to choose from. Different game modes to keep things interesting. 
Free to play but not pay to win. Some of the best guns in the game are the guns you start with.

I like everything about the game. The movement, the guns, the maps etc. The only down side is the amount of damage it can take to kill a enemy. You need to get head shots to dispatch a enemy quickly.

WIth the updates this game has become one of my clans favorites to play.

I woud recommend youtry the game out. Especially for the price ;)"
24179,"Kinda sucks. Basically Combat Arms trying to be CSGO trying to be Call of Duty on drugs. No speed penalty when strafing or aiming (this is weird). Your average mediocre FPS. Install for shits and giggles, uninstall in an hour because there's nothing that makes it better than any other FPS... Unless you have no money, then by all means play this game because it's not pay-to-win. The good graphics still doesn't save the game from being boring tho.

Pros:
-Free to Play
-Not pay-to-win
-Better graphics than comparable F2P shooters

Cons:
-Very fast, no movement penalty (a pro to some)
-Very average
-Very repetitive, you'll probably be alive for less than 30 seconds, get some kills, respawn, repeat."
24180,"Mediocre shooter thats F2P and doesn't have any P2W mechanics. Mechanically the game needs some work, there are some oversights here and there, and the UI is worse than average. However its a F2P shooter completely missing P2W mechanics, that in itself should give anyone on a budget a good reason to pick this game up. 

The ""Should you play it?"" goes like this 

Do you have money to play more premium games? If yes, then probably just play those. If not however, this is a great choice in a sea of P2W garbage."
24181,"I had been looking for some good fun online FPS game like GRP, so far Planetside 2 is doing good job satisfying that need.
But BLACK SQUAD surely makes it to my favorite online FPS game list now. Game is filled with fast action, awesome weapon designs and damage effects, maps are quite decent too. Playing its early access version right now but still game looks and plays good. I think it has four type of match modes, except for team deathmatch, rest are ok and with time people with enjoy it more I guess. But currently i'm enjoying its Team Deathmatch more due to its fast paced action.

So far only problem I have faced during gameplay is swirling left or right quickly during firefights is laggy and bit delayed. I have adjusted my mouse sensitivity many times too but it still persists. I really hope they fix it.

Other than that so far not faced any other issues, will update if find something else. It doesn't look like Pay to Win till now, good job there devs, now please find some strong way to keep hackers away in near future.

- Good weapon designs
- Shots from different guns looks and feels impactful
- Believable class skills rather than some super-human abilities
- Fast paced action


Have fun ! :)"
24182,very nice game but needs more ppl at the moment.
24183,"One of the most clunky fps ive ever played, if you wanted a f2p, bad csgo, this is the game for you"
24184,"Too much ping compensation. People with 400 ping shoot peak and shoot you, and you see them 3 seconds after you die. The menu can be difficult to navigate. Pistols are way too overpowered. No voice chat for things like Demolition (competitive in CS, Search & Destroy in COD)."
24185,where are all the blacks?
24186,I think I have a large lump on the back of my head now... this shit gave me cancer
24187,Possibly the worst game i have ever played.
24188,"Game is clunky as hell, gun damages make no sense, the glock does more damage than the tar21"
24189,This game is awesome !!! I wish you good luck with it :D
24190,"It's like a fusion of combat arms and counter-strike. If you like counter-strike style shooters and collecting guns, you might like this game.

Pros: 
-F2p
-Lots of guns
-Decent shooting and hit registration
-Decent graphics and animations
-Low requirements

Cons:
-Terrible gun sounds and unbearable hit sounds
-Maps are ""crowded"" in terms of potential locations for enemies to come at you from at almost every point on a given map"
24191,"Great Game And Awesome Tutorial. I like this game because its like CoD4 MW and CS:GO combined! i can see this game being in the Top 10 Games on Steam!

Team BlackSquad for the WIN!!!"
24192,"Very good game for free... gives off a subtle overwatch vibe in the fact its always gogogogo
I liked it
"
24193,no
24194,"so many asians laggers in eu servers 
and so many hackers coming and game without reports system is gona be full hackers
and no anticheat
this game will die soon and hackers will play alone"
24195,"I really enjoyed the hour I played, more to come from me.

Oh yeah and every FPS game other than Battlefield is a ""CoD Simulator"" apparently. 
You literally see that it in every review/discussion.

Don't mind the mindless review CoD comparers. 
It's a good game, try it yourself."
24196,Unplayable with high ping Huge amount of hackers with no way to report them this game is over bf it started
24197,"This game is really fun, im not gonna lie. It's very good for low end pc too but the only problem is the balancing which is okay right now cause it's in beta. What i commend the developers is that this game is not p2w which is amazing. Get the game now, it's free and it's fun"
24198,"Not sure how this game even got ""mostly positive"""
24199,I hope they keep it up and not making it a Pay to win!
24200,Game is just ok. TD has a Cross Fire map reskin and some shit boat map. Weapon handling might be the worst I've seen. There needs to be zoom sensitivity too. Could get better.
24201,"Welp, i played 8 hours straight in one day so, yeah, I think its pretty addicting.

The developers are making it out to be ""the best f2p shooter"", while it certainly won't reach that point it certainly has a 
lot of potential, even if it seems like just another fps game.

There is pay to win, if you dont pay for the overpowered weapons you wont get that far, and you have to grind for a long time just to get 1 gun, 8+ hours and am just 100 off a pistol (maybe reduce prices for everything jussst a tiny bit), also while nothing else has been added, i noticed that in the future you can probably swap your armour out, and that means getting better armour than everyone else and taking more hits, probably to be found in a case that you pay a fair bit of money for... also, they DO have two free dlcs with a bunch of weapons, but that only lasts 15 days, and I think the devs are tryna make it look like free stuff will come out like that all the time.

Also, just wanna address some things that I and others might want changed, 1. The bullet chambering mechanic- it's kinda confusing having the +1, reloading your gun and having the one extra bullet, and then reloading again and having that extra bullet still even when it says you have 0 ammo | 2. When you go to place a claymore or use an airstrike, even if its at the end of the animation or the little strike marker turn white, if you die it wont place/fire, this doesn't seem like something too annoying but i've had many encounters where this has been annoying | 3. Fix up the english and other languages a bit better, and make it clearer on what to do in the lobby when searching for a game, maybe replace the tutorial button with just a ""search"" button which takes you to the room selection then you hit the same button again, because having to click the small little regions and then the room is confusing for new players a tiny tiny bit annoying, making me accidentaly enter the tutorial once or twice.

In conclusion I find it really satisfying to play and the guns are all fun to use, and I think it's gonna grow soon."
24202,"First of all, the music in the game is irritating at best. They tried to do the steroetypical metal music with the army guys but they failed in a burn and crash attempt. Playing this game is like being inside a train wreck, it starts off fine and then 20 minutes in you just die inside, the hitboxes in-game are so shit that you can be shot while behind walls and in cover. There are also no good servers for the whole of Australia and NZ so forget about having good ping in-game if you're from there. The guns were made to look good but that's about all that looks good in this game, the maps look terrible and feel terrrible (As well as the map layout beinh horrible, they have no structure to them at all, it's just a maze of hallways and tunnels which means you can get shot from behind using 50 different routes). I would highly suggest not wasting your time and interenet usage on downloading this game because you will be very dissapointed and angered by the lack of effort and care put into this game"
24203,GOOD GAME
24204,"For being a F2P shooter it's not bad.

my only downside is there are no australian servers"
24205,"DIS GAEM IS FOCKEN GREAT M8. 

Sound when you kill someone with a headshot is beautiful

10/5 just for the sound 

Good Job Devs,keep up the good work"
24206,"I totally recommend this game f2p.
Not a pay 2 win."
24207,"This game is everything wrong with online FPS, but with enough quality to be functional.

- Terrible menus
- Terrible modes
- Terrible weapon handling
- Terrible balancing
- Imagine COD if it wanted to be CS:GO but had a $0 budget.

- Visual quality isn't bad on the character and weapon models, but everything else looks bad.

This is possibly the most generic f2p fps I've ever seen and I've played a few, I guess if you dont really care about quality you can enjoy this game but if you do then dont bother the download."
24208,Black squad has a great chance to be a well used game i enjoyed playing the game and the design makes the game look amazing for a f2p game
24209,"good free to play fps, except the sounds r earrape"
24210,"It's like no-name brand Counter Strike with arcadey elements. The weapons are pretty cheap and you can grab a couple of free packages that give you a bunch of good weapons on a 15 day timer you can use to grind. Balance seems a little off; The KSG and one of the snipers are leagues better than the other weapons, but you get both of them at the start, so it's not that big of a deal."
24211,0/10 Tac Reaload!!!
24212,"It's not anything special; it doesn't really bring anything new to the table but it's decent.

It's worth playing if you're looking for a non-pay-to-win semi-competitive fps, but be prepared to grind a fuck-ton if you want to buy a new gun."
24213,"Needs A LOT of balancing before I even consider playing again. Also, MICROTRANSACTIONS!!! Way too many hacker on here already as well."
24214,"Not worth the download, too many haxors. i can go on but no point. ill come back to it maybe. idk shooters aren't really rare these days."
24215,good game.
24216,It's really bad.
24217,"Pay to win. It tries to say it isn't, but it is. Disregarding that, this is a bad CS clone. Avoid like AIDS."
24218,"This game has some real potential to become something great. So for now, i would highly recommend it."
24219,Can we get an Oceania server please?
24220,"Great game no pay to win features. Just good old fps gameplay with nice features,UI,etc. 9/10 would make sure to check it out it's free and fun."
24221,"Counter Strike, Call of Duty, and Battlefield vibes.

It's honestly well optimized and good FOR a Free-to-Play game.


Other than that, it doesn't hold up to the current standard of quality First-Person-Shooters. However, this is probably the best you'll get for a free to play FPS game.

Pros:
- Great Graphics and Models
- Well Optimized
- Free to Play and not Pay to Win

Cons:
- Guns are broken. ( Barely any recoil, and instant kill in one spray. )
- Too fast-paced"
24222,Headshot or die simulator.
24223,"ITS 2017
 
Game physics are 2012
Game graphics are 2012 

5/10 overall
would rate 10/10 if it was 2012
"
24224,First of all it the menu is super confusing and the grenades only go 2-3 feet in front of you because the people you are playing as are super scrawny and can't throw for anything.
24225,make asian server
24226,"Uses stolen reskinned assets from Turbosquid, controls are weird, tries to do more then its capable of. All guns have 0 recoil even when fired from hip, maps are dumb, AI feels like your playing an android gallery shooter. Feels like a pay to play quake clone without good maps, decent controls, dynamic AI, Decent UI, Weapon varity (Because they all shoot exactly the same.), rocket jumps or fun. 3/10 because some of the animations are visually pleaseing."
24227,"Absolutely recommend it. 

Fix snipers though :C"
24228,"I think this is a pretty good FPS, but the game menu for joining games needs to be remodeled. It was confusing on how to join a game at first."
24229,"It's like if CSGO, Black Ops II, and Arma had a retarded baby."
24230,"It's not really a skill based shooter. It's much more like COD than it is like CS. 

Here are the basic pros/cons

Pros:
- Good Graphics
- F2P with no pay to win variables
- Good integrated menu options such as crosshair customization

Cons:
- Minimal strategy involved
- Minimal skill involved
- Minimal communication required 
- Sluggish movement and weapons mechanics
"
24231,Would be a good game if it wasn't for the snipers that can one shot you if you are hit in the foot.
24232,"the game is shit at the moment, hackers are everywhere, there are only EU, NA and SA servers, i live in australia and was lucky to get less than 300 ping, and the game feels like an ios port. However the game is pretty well optimized, so thats a plus... i guess"
24233,"After I got past the tutorial... I finished cringing. Then I looked at the shop and figured out it had one of those weapon rental systems where you have to sell yourself to the game to own a worthy permanent weapon. This game as a whole is not a good investment for anyone's time. The description itself should be a warning sign for how amature these developers are. ""Welcome to the best F2P shooter on the market"", is very bold for what is being presented."
24234,"At first this game looks like your standard F2P Korean P2W fps, but it's suprisingly not that and it's relatively fun. 

However there are lots of balance issues and things of that sort. I suppose it's passable since this game is in Early Access. Some of the problems are:

eMaps are cramped and tiny, damage scale is horrible. Most guns have no recoil, snipers and shotguns are op as shit. Other than that, this game has alot of potential."
24235,A great game with a combination of COD and CS. Definitely recommend.
24236,"Amazing, Face-Paced, Untoxic, Badass Game. It's amazing. I'd recommend to people that have played TF2, CS:GO, and other face-paced FPS.

Overall Rating: 9.7/10"
24237,maps are too small and fighting is really bad 2 hits and your dead really bad you spend more time respawning then playing
24238,"Such a good game, I'm going to be playing this everyday!"
24239,"For a F2P game this has a lot going for it. While it still has a few clunks in it, it is still in Early Access so that's to be expected. 

Pros:
-To start off guns are a permanent buy, it's not like those games where you have to re-buy a gun every week and they're also quite affordable. With the money that you start off with you can get 2 nice weapons with all of the attachments to them. 
-Matchmaking is also pretty smooth, never had to wait more than 30 seconds for a match in any playlist 
-There's a few different gametypes: TDM, Assassination (kill a VIP then escape on a helicopter), Destruction (destroy these big box things and get points), and Bomb (typical teams taking turns planting or defusing bombs).
-There's four different classes, and while they aren't terribly different, they do add some form of variety, and also any weapons can be used in any class (classes are only used in Destruction).
-Game is not intensive and you can pretty much play it with 100 fps on a toaster.

Cons:
-Switching weapons/switching between sprinting and normal movement/switching to primary after throwing a grenade takes a really long time. This eliminates running and gunning sorta because of the 2 second lag time after sprinting to the point that your gun can actually be fired, but it seems way too long especially after throwing a grenade and having to wait behind cover for a bit until you pull out your gun.
-Recoil is 100% scripted for each gun making it very easy to make a macro for a gun to shoot perfectly straight. This isn't considered ""hacking"" persay, but it is really annoying because someone with a 100 clip LMG that’s supposed to be inaccurate can shoot perfectly straight with only a basic knowledge of how to make a mouse macro.
-Movement in general seems a bit clumsy. Something about the way that you can turn directions really quickly, or how fluid it is when you move makes it feel wrong. But again the game is in Early Access, and I'm sure they'll be able to work on that.
-There is a special currency store with weapons in it that after looking at them for a little while definitely are better than those that you can get with the normal ""gold"" (which is silver but oh well), so that has the danger of becoming P2W, but as of rn it doesn't matter because nobody really has them, and they seem balanced enough.
-There are also not many maps but I’m sure they’ll come out with more so that also isn’t a problem
-The biggest con however I saved for last and it’s that this game doesn’t bring anything new to the board. It’s very similar to CS in both look and play, and also is a lot like old-school Warface PVP. So I most likely won’t be playing it much because of this, but if they stay true to the F2P model, then it has a lot of potential of becoming a good FPS game.
"
24240,"tact reload, tact reload, tact, reload...... other than that the game is ok"
24241,ye
24242,"Solid game, good replacement for Arctic Combat and AVA. F2P, paid aspect of the game is just weapon skins so far. Dev team is active and takes suggestions and criticism. Biggest complaints are the ugly, cluttered gui and the poor maps. TDM gets it worst with very claustrophobic maps. 

If it gets the support it needs without turning into a nickled-and-dimed cash grab with how Aeria treated AVA, mite b promising."

24245,Pretty fun game I rather buy it than pay for gun to use for so many days but i guesss pay to play is the new way games are going now.. I had fun playing it kudos!
24246,"+fun fast paced meat grinder

24250,"Fucking terrible game!


All guns are useless, the servers are trash and the game is awful.

Every gun fucking sucks. BAD, like it takes fucking 8000 shots to kill one guy or the gun is super fucking op."
24251,add asia server please :)
24252,it seems like a good game. i just dont like how damage works and spawning. idk
24253,Legit
24254,"Not the worst F2P title my friend has had me play, but after an hour and a half nearly we had lost every game and by a substantial amount. MM definitely needs some work."
24255,"For a game that fairly new, as well as being in early access, its a great game! And also Considering the fact that this game is free, I think that this game is awesome! It is not P2W (Pay to Win). In fact, I only could find 1 way you could pay, and the premium currecny is only for skins! For Simplicity sake, I will show the Pros and Cons

-Pros-
~It's Free
~NOT P2W (there is a use for Premium currency, but only for skins and stuff)
~You can use Iron sights
~good variety of Game Modes
~Not super High computer Requirements, yet still looks nice (Unreal Engine 3 For The Win!)
~Not a lot of Glitches
~Only an 11 Gig download
~Playing with friends is really simple, and not that complicated
~No sign up
~Steady servers (they don't crash)
~Adding more content :D
~No OP weapons, overall very balanced
~Developers actually care

-Cons- (most of these are minor issues)
~limited customisation
~Very Limited amount of weapons you can use (just added a couple of more in the last update)
~Only 3 available customizable loadouts (I know thats about the standard, but wish there was 1 or 2 more)
~unless you log in everyday and do the challenges, you will grind heavily
~Some maps feel unbalanced
~some lag spikes during gameplay
~Hackers are not that uncommon, and no anti-cheat system, or even a report option :/
~gernade launchers don't do enough damage in my opinion (they are not noob tubes, so thats good, but you could survive getting hit dead on with a gernade launcher)
~When you open a random box, you gotta drang your mouse left and right to spin a card around, but 99% of the time it doesn't work properly, so you will look like an idiot with your mouse, and going crazy with it. I don't see why they can't just let the box open and you see what you get :/
~Noticable typos and a poor sense of grammar

But hey, For an Early Access Game, this is really good. Hopefully we will see an update that will give us some more content! The challenges help you with grinding, and you start out with 200K gold, which is enough to buy you at least any 1 weapon of your choice! But because this game is early access, things might be prone to change, and My review may vary, but for now, I would highly reccomend getting this game!

As of now, I will give this game an 8/10 For being a non-p2w, free to play FPS, but some frustrations such as no anti-cheat or even report button"
24256,Not a bad mix between CoD and CS:GO 8/10
24257,"This game is really good just nerf quickscoping , better the matchmaking ,and find a way to get rid of the spawn trapping issue in TDM."
24258,"Really good game so far, can't wait for the full game to come out hopefully it doesn't get messed up in the transition from early access to full release. (Hope it gets out of early access)"
24259,güzel oyun
24260,extremely floaty meh maps meh mechanics  guns feel like im shooting a laser beam
24261,This game is actually very fun at times but sometimes the other team will be full of shotguns which should be nerfed and have stupid range otherwise hours of fun
24262,"Uninstalled after one hour due to the game being too easy.

You get given every weapon and the player base lacks skill.

Not much room for progression you simply kill noobs every game."
24263,"Other than the Lag spikes you will have in MP, this is quite the game. In a few words, it would be COD and CSGO mashed together but animations are stiffer than boulders. After 5 mins of tweaking in the settings, the game runs smoothly. Very customizable settings as well. This game probably needs another few months of developed and it will become a favorite among COD players. CSGO players will also be entertained but the tutorial did show some sort of killstreak system which favors the other community better. I find the MP7 is a bit OP, but it may be my playstyle. I would give this game 7/10."
24264,yup
24265,A solid FPS. Great fun!
24266,haha they're straight up begging for positive reviews on their discord epic
24267,"Not bad. But of course this is a early access game albeit a free one (at the time of this writing though) and somewhat one of the better ones. 

Obviously the graphics aren't the best but the opitimization of this game is very good even for my system (a Haswell i3-4170, 8GB of DDR3 RAM, Windows 10 Pro, and a 2GB GDDR5 Radeon R9 270) at the highest settings at 1080p. However for its unreal engine 3, it looks pretty good. 

As for gameplay.....it's average but not completely crap. Its gameplay could be better and with a bit tweaking there, it would definitely be a lot more decent. 

What is bad about this f2p fps game is that the hit detection and its netcoding are a tad......well....it's similar to Battlefield 4's netcode prior to its huge netcode patch fix last year as in not very good and at times very spotty. 

Aside from that, this game is at least worth a try if you are interested on free first-person shooters."
24268,For a free game it feels very polished. There is also no P2W so that's awesome.
24269,Good game
24270,"Has an insane peakers advantage for high ping players

It should kick people based on their ping if it's too high, but no. Stay away from this one."
24271,200 ping #1
24272,"7/10 Def wont use lmg's again. 

Assault rifles and bolt action rifles rule this game. But for a f2p game its a pretty damn good. Needs voice chat"
24273,lo mejor <3
24274,One Of The Best F2P Games Out There
24275,"If some more region servers are added, it could become THE biggest F2P shooter. 
Currently there are 3 servers: NA, EU and SA (South America)."
24276,Nice game getting free knife :)
24277,Amazing game but the issue i had with it is when you load up into a match or respawn your gun is missing 1 bullet and that really bugs me bt other than that great job
24278,"This game is fun! Its like a mix of CSGO, COD, and Warface. 

Positives: 
Good graphics
Fun
Cool skins
Good animations
Good game modes
Maps are awesome

Negatives:
Score Streaks are too much like COD
Shotgun is a bit OP. (Mostly the KSG)
Guns needs more recoil
Change the recoil from side to side (mostly) to up and down.


All of the negatives are small but not that big of a deal. If they change it, it will be a better game. 8.5/10 tho!

24289,"Literally everything is ok but one thing.  The KSG, a pump action shotgun, shoots quicker than it should and does way to much damage to shoot that fast.  If you are gunna make it to where it does that much damage please nerf fire rate.  If you dont nerf firerate nerf damage.  EITHER WAY KSG NEEDS TO BE NERFED"
24290,"like call of duty but with a weird sprint animation.

24292,"When I was 12/3 k/d the game disconnected me...
lel. gg."
24293,"instead of yes and no, I hope there is a ""so-so"" too. then I would totally hit that."
24294,"Black Squad is an okay game. Its nothing spectacular, its just a free to play first person shooter.
Pros:
Weapon Balance is good
ttk is decent
Skill based, not pay to win

cons:
no weapon customization
Sights and attachments are locked
UI is weird, it took me a few minutes to figure out what I was looking at

overall its nothing special but if you are looking for a shooter to burn some time this is for you. Not for those looking for good graphics or gameplay."
24295,"I know that at the time i am writing this review i barley had any play time on the game but if you are looking for a truly free to play FPS shooter look no furthur this is the game for you let me explain:

1. The first question asked about any free to play game is weather or not its pay 2 win and i am glad to say that its totally not every weapon and item can be obtained by simply playing the game the game is also rewarding for a ton of stuff like playing and logging in daily and finishing tutorials and doing stuff like playing a number of matches each day with cool rewards really useful ones too you only pay real money for cosmetics which never effect gameplay only what your char and weapon look like

2. The game for me at least  ran perfectly well and i dont have such a smooth gameplay experience with most games it runs really well no bugs no unexplained glitches that come out of nowehere its solid interms of performance

3. This game is in early acess but dont let that fool you its great and the devalopers are taking good care of it they will lisent to the community and they take player's suggestions and comments very seriously also they are working on elemenating the number of hackers they carefuly examin reports of hackers which are so easy to report btw so you shouldnt run to many of them

4. For a game that was released 2 days ago the player base is great i always manage to find a game instantly regardless of what mode i am playing

5. Finally this game has a variaty of things to do multiple classes with special abilities that define each class's role medics heal snipers have ablities which make them able to posiiton them selves and scout enemies so easily while rifle men and marks men are also equiped with abilities that counter those of the other classes to make the game balanced and fair also dont worry about being confused the game explains everything for you very well with detailed explanations of each class and ability and tips and how to use them in combat

Overall this game is pretty solid and i cant wait for it to devalop its a combination of Call of Duty, Warface and a little bit of Overwatch due to each char having a spasific role to play as you shall see yourself I definatley recommend it and if you try and you are not satisfied at least you didnt spend any money on it as it is a free to play

The only cons I see are hackers for one but they are in every game and the devalopers are doing what they can to take care of them and although there are many ways to customize a weapon in each class by adding attachments and all that the amount of weapons them selves are reletavely low i can let this go as the game was released only 2 days ago and is still under devalopment but i am hoping to see more weapons in the future that emphasize the class's role more.

8/10"
24296,"realy good for f2p as well as its realy fun this game beats counter strike
"
24297,"dis game is gud. i recommend dis game. one of best free play games..

only bad thing bout game is there are alot of hackrs adn lot of try herds. overallll gud game though :)

add meh for mod menu"
24298,"The time has finally came, Black Squad is on Steam!
Absolutely NOT p2w, you can buy everything you need with in-game earned points.

IMHO it could become a good e-sport game because it's very balanced and no one has advantages over the others, absolutely incredible for a f2p...

At the moment the game has only ONE con: The TDM's maps are way too small. When they'll add bigger maps for TDM and new contents, i think it will become one of the best f2p on the market."
24299,"Pro:
- Free to play
- Good graphics
- More realistic than a few popular ""tactic""-shooters

Con:
- Mostly awful community (changes at night on the EU-server)
- Hitboxes are relativ... Headshot can be a shot to the arm
- Cause of Early-Access only Primary-weapons in the shop (devs seem to be working on that)"
24300,"This game is a mixture of Call of Duty and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,I would recommend this to any person that likes fps.The graphics are good and it has many game modes.I havent seen anything pay to win,All you can buy is skins from unboxing."
24301,pretty good
24302,"I'd definitely recommend this game. It's damn enjoyable. It's got some nice graphics and the core gameplay is great. Definitely give this game a go, you won't regret it."
24303,"This game is still EA so I'll keep that in mind in my review:

Pros:

-I like the F1, F2 and F3 loadout feature. If you played Ghost In The Shell: SAC then you'll be familiar with it. 
You pick a primary, secondary, melee, grenade and other equipment relevant to that playstyle per F slot. During games you can quickly switch between these presets after death to choose a different playstyle. 

-Graphically the game looks great. 

-The maps are well thought out.

-Based on the amount of firearms in the game, I suspect there will be a lot of choice in the future.

-Blood on the walls after you kill someone. 

Cons:

-No sprint option, you have to use a knife to run. This makes me sad. I like my games realistic and with all the other efforts this game chose to make that so, you'd figure this would be too. 

-Health is not based on parts of your body, except the head which is an instant kill. I'd very much rather see arms, legs and torso have their own HP with lowering movement speed if legs are damaged and lowering accuracy if arms are damaged. 

-No stamina bar, so bunny hoppers run rampant. This will also allow for greater success with aimbots.

tl;dr: This game looks great and plays well. It still has a chance to improve. I'll be checking in on it and suggest you do the same. 7/10 will keep installed."

24308,"It's the red headed stepchild of Call of Duty and Counter Strike Source that loved to eat paintchips as a child. It was not only dropped from the roof of a two story building as a child, but it aslo  later managed to survive nearly drowning in a foot of water in its puberty. Now it has grown up to be a respectable gang banger of Detroit."
24309,"If their definition of great shooting mechanics means jump peaking while being able to hipfire and get 3 headshots in a row, I guess this game hits it out of the park!

The game plays like one of those cheap chinese FPSes. No recoil, small map, buying/playing a lot earns you victories.

If a F2P CoD is for you, come play this game! Quick scoping, spray and praying, and farm to win makes this the experience for you!

If you want a lick of skill involved in your games, stay far away from it."

If you've played Warrock, Combat Arms, Warface, AVA, Crossfire, Operation 7, Wolf Team, Ghost in the Shell, and many others... and if it's what you're looking for, then this is it.

The same mechanics, even down to the weapon rentals. I won't bother writing a real review for this title as it brings obsolutely nothing new to the table and it's a mare clone of every other shooter game available. Is it bad? Nah, it's as good as all those other games I mention with better graphics.

Enjoy."
24315,"Fun brainless fast-paced arcadey shooter that's easy to learn. If that sounds interesting to you, try it, if not, don't.

TACRELOAD / 10"
24316,"Great tutorial, rest of the game is crap though."
24317,"Feels pretty generic, and a lot like something else I've played in the past... What was it called again, retaliation attack or something? Anyway, weapon accuracy is insanely high compared to most FPS games. Good or bad, that's probably up to you. No sprinting or anything, and much like that game I can't seem to recall the name of, pulling out your knife increases your movement speed. In melee range, it literally takes three headshots from the Vector SMG to kill a player.

Give it a shot if you like FPS games, if you like a CS clone trying to be call of duty, this is probably your game. If you don't, you'll figure that out soon enough as well.

UE3 is also showing its age, or perhaps it's simply this game. The graphics are far from groundbreaking. 5 years ago I'd say this game looked pretty good, but unfortunately this is 2017. Being F2P that actually makes sense - A huge portion of the F2P market is essentially running toaster ovens.

Also why do my magazines only hold 29 rounds? Why do I have to reload twice to get the usual 30? Shouldn't it reload 30 in a mag +1, and not 29 +1?"
24318,"I've played 98 minutes with a friend,this game worth a try.

Pros: You can play this game even on a potato
         You can have a lot of fun while playing

24325,"At first te game seems fun... its a cheap Asian clone of Counter strike...

Easy to get the first few ranks and rank up. The menu is complex and can be hard to understand for some players how to join mplayer games.

once in game the hit reg is ok, servers seem stable and the maps are also bad clones of counter strike maps such ad Dust and aztec. 

After a few ranks i noticed the skill level went up drasticly. But it was down to hackers. My ast 4 matches the clans was bragging about how the ""own the game"" and they are all gods.... some players also posting links in chat where to get the hacks from!

A huge ammount of hackers already! This game does not have any Anti-Cheat systems in place.

Stay clear until some Anti-Cheat systems are in place."

24329,Good game!
24330,"If COD and CS:GO had a baby, this would be it. Beautiful game with the feel of an old arcade-style FPS. Not much skill or thought involved, just run and gun.

Edit: The more I play, the less fun it is. All the maps are about the size of a college dorm, so 90% of the time you're fighting right in front of your own or the enemy's spawn. That said, you get what you pay for."
24331,"Not worth the time.

Not a bad game, but it does nothing really well. The maps are also pretty cancerous. Enjoy another game for $20 or less. You can sink maybe 10 hours in here, but its not gonna be worth the time really.
"
24332,Most F2P Shooters are crap... This one isn't.
24333,its a very fun game feels like a combination of cs go and call of duty. There is nothing to complain about especially with the game being free although i would like to see custom attachments
24334,"It is very chaotic, and just plain dumb. It is just like a weird form of Call of Duty with op weapons even from the very start. You can literally Run&Gun with a sniper rifle, and you will do just fine if you W+M1 with an smg and/or assault rifle. It can be fun but it gets boring very quick, since it has a extremly low skill ceiling (You just have to point and shoot because there is no recoil and if you aim down sights there is almost no spred as well). But if you realy like Call of Duty and can't afford one this can be a good replacement."
24335,Im enjoying the game I just wish there was an ASIA sever  so i can stop playing matches with 400 ping
24336,"I really do like this game. It has a fast paced vibe but laid back as well. Heavily mulitplayer oriented. There are however a few things that i dislike. Let me explain.

Match searching takes way too long. Don't know if it's not many players or what.

No controller support. It doesn't effect me but others it may.

no way to adjust sprint. It would be nice to have it on shift or a different key instead of midclick

Campaign. I do like multiplayer but a campaign would be cool. maybe make it Multiplayer too. As well as maybe a firefight?

Grenade damage needs to be amped up a little bit more.

Other than those five details, minus a couple of bugs with guns every now and then, it's a really good game that I reccomend for a casual free to play fps shooter."

Except with all the hackers now."
24345,"the game can run on a super shity laptop so no worrys there. the game has raraly any lag so no worrys there. and the game is fun. what they should add is more modes and weekly events: zombie and double XP or the double money. overall a great early access and free to play game. :)
"
24346,"MP7A1 is the most powerful gun in game, it shoots fast, it's too accurate and it has got range of sniper rifle

24347,"Pretty solid, balanced shooter, not pay to win at all, but the hackers need to be worked out. Still a lot of fun though."
24348,"This game is pretty bad to be honest, its basically a Cod, just worse
"
24349,Great Game!
24350,"Somethings I have to say about this game so far, it's a fast pace and free first person shooter. It is extremely similar to other free FPS games that I have played such as Combat Arms. The main menu is full of lots of different features but I believe there are too many of these features displayed on the main page and it is easy to get lost.

Al though it is not pay to win, it is pay to advance quicker as the game uses a unlock feature for the weapons, you have time limited unlocks and then expensive permanent unlocks.

The game play itself is fast like I mentioned earlier. It seems that the groups you're mixed with are random as I've experienced lots of people who are playing who just can't grasp the game yet, but with the game being new, I understand everyone has different learning speeds. The one major negative I have to say about the current state of the game is that there is an issue with ping and net code. I have been in many situations in which, I or my teammates I am spectating are behind a wall and get killed. I do understand there is terrain in this game which you can shoot through but there are moments where that does not explain some of these deaths.

Overall, I see lots of positivity towards this game once the initial wave of issues has been fixed."
24351,"Great game. Reminds me of cs 1.6 in a way.. aim, gameknowledge, timing, teamplay... without all the bullshit futuristic perks and abilities that are in these so called fps nowadays. 

Pros:
+replayability
+fast to learn, difficult to master
+No russian voice or voice at all yelling in your ears
+Not pay to win 

Cons:
-No bunnyhopping
-Alot of hackers to be such a small community
-No report system
-Chunky Menu
-No ranked system
-No server browers

Hackers will probably destroy this game as well before it has even begun growing.

It's still in early access so all these things can improve or go straight to shit over time. 
"
24352,"PROS
Graphics options are good for those with potato systems like me

Fair weapon variety for a EA Game released a day ago

Appears to be a somewhat balanced grind for new equipment

Tutorial isn't too bad but can definitely be improved upon


CONS
Hackers. Lots of em. 

Menu Interace (UI) seems to be way too overly complicated

Default control bindings are pretty terrible too 


Im sure there's more i missed but given the cons and how they are more signficant to me personally than to someone else, i will have to give this game a negative recommendation. But that doesn't mean it's downright terrible cause it isn't, it just needs some patches is all. And once the cons i listed are fixed i will give it a go again and adjust my review."
24353,"The game is great a few more maps would be nice, and maybe a few more guns. My only problem is you spawn with a mag. thats one round short.

Pros
     -Good graphics
     -Good and smooth shooting machanics
     -Nice and stable servers(or at least for me)
     -A few decent game modes
Cons
  - sometimes people put sentry turrets at your spawn
  - Hard to get in game curancy
  -Skilled players can make it harder for new players to get into the game

Overall 9/10 
Still better than call of duty :)




"
24354,nope
24355,My only issue with the game is limited maps which is normal for ftp. Otherwise if you like counter stike you will like this game.
24356,"I did not pay for this game, but i still feel scammed."
24357,Literally debuff the KSG....and pistols other then the deagle and the other pistol in the medal shop...great game other wise alot of fun.

Game is Focused on SKill and Aiming not simple RNG
Fast Paced
No Hackers so Far

Cons:
No Zoom Sensitive Option
Hip Fire Accuracy
Some Weapons go Zero Recoil and Spread
No One Shot Headshot

24359,Very nice
24360,"The game is fine. Good graphic, good sounds, map are balanced, the gunplay is fair...
It's... nothing ""special"" or unique... neither innovating and it doesn't require much skill to dominate so it's kinda a ""everybody can get some frags"".

I wouldn't recommend it couse generally i would say ""mnay mnay mnay... just another Point Black clone with some Counter Strike game modes... mnay mnay mnay... they just want some money through microtransactions i guess mnay mnay mnay...""

BUT NO: I hardly RECOMMEND THIS GAME couse it is... finally... A TRUE 100% FFFFFRRRRrrreeeeee to play. FREE.
YOU. DO. NOT. HAVE. TO. SHOP. A. THING. WITH. REAL. MONEY. And you don't have to grind like a crazy korean kid.

So just give it a try. Have a good game everybody! ^_^"
24361,"It doesn't have a hardcore mode. Players are bullet sponges.  I'll comback if that is ever fixed, otherwise, fun game."
24362,"The ""review"" is positive only cause the game is a pure F2P without any P2W.
That's all. The game itself is mediocre to the bones. 


 better than CS:GO tho"
24363,Nice game runs good on shitty PCs but i feel there is no objective give co-op or missions or something
24364,"Feels like a mix between Combat Arms, Counter-Strike, and Call of Duty.  Extremely shallow and generic gameplay, and too fast paced.  Also lots and lots of broken English everywhere."
24365,"A very good game , I recomend it !"
24366,"If you like getting one shot through boxes and walls over and over, this is the game for you. Also, a UI that makes no sense, and way too many cash shop mechanics. No thanks."
24367,"Black Squad, honestly it seems pretty good, maybe a little rough around the edges but overall if you are into free to play shooters I would recommend you check it out."
24368,An error occured with the anticheat program. Please restart your game. BVLLSHIT! I wasted 4GB on my sh!t laptop to download this game that says I got a problem with my anticheat system! HOW?!?!
24369,"Bad game, cluncky gameplay,
sprint with mousewheel
sprinting swithces to knife
stop sprinting switches to gun
aiming with ironsights is slow

bad game, play csgo or any call of duty"
24370,Awesome!!!!!!!! Great FPS game just put replay after kill and its perfect! Thank you!
24371,Good game need Asia server.
24372,"Mostly good game, just a few issues here and there."
24373,!
24374,"Really fun and entertaining. This game is a free to play fps with a mix of warface and csgo or counterstrike. This game brings a huge wow as the graphics and the mechanics of the game are very impresive, there are a few weapons that need to be tweeked such as snipers. The damage is too high. If you are a csgo player (like me) this is a game for you, it is just as good and just as in tence. iv only been playing for a hour now and it felt like minutes, its is a very rage reducing game as there is a very little spawn delay. It also gives you the option to pratice in pratice mode (no shit) there are a few game modes in the game and soon i hope they will add a ranked mode as well for the competative players. A few game modes to name are TDM, Demolition 5v5, Demolition 8v8, Assasination and Destruction. This game shown very high potential for the future and i believe that this game so far has been a huge hit on the steam community."
24375,The game is honestly a 5/10 it's just your generic run of the mil f2p shooter nothing really stands out. Honestly give it a go the game is fun for like 20 mins or so.
24376,"First something positive. The sound effects and graphics are very nice, but the sound effects
especially are outstanding. I absolutely love the sound in this game. When you shoot someone you can almost feel it hit due to the amazing sound effects.

So I'm not exactly a fan of Call of Duty. I used to be but I left the series after Modern Warfare 2. Black Squad feels a lot like Call of Duty to me, and by that I mean you live for 10 - 20 seconds until you have to respawn again. It's a constant respawn fest and very boring since you always  respawn in the exact same location. It feels so repetetive and not in a fun way.

The map design in Black Squad is terrible - unless you like having very short lifespans. If that's the case you'll enjoy it. I don't though, I like to live for a while and not having to constantly be running from the respawn point. One of the worst maps I've ever played is the Cruise Ship level, it's atrociously designed and far too tiny. You basically spawn, run ahead 15 steps, shoot, and either get the kill or get killed. If you die you have to respawn. If you get the kill, right after that you die and have to respawn. So repetetive and incredibly boring.

On top of that, there is no real deathmatch. There is only team stuff. I hate team stuff, I like to do free for all deathmatches and this game does not have that.

While it feels rough and totally not my type of game, I do see how some people could enjoy this. The game is designed to be fun for people who enjoy Call of Duty style FPS rather than Battlefiend or Ghost Recon FPS. There is no time for any strategy at all, it's just run ahead and shoot until you die, then repeat. I also don't know why these games have sniper rifles in them. None of the maps feel like they have any place to set up for sniping at all and even if you were to find somewhere, chances are you will be dead within 5 seconds of finding it.

I will not recommend this game because even though it's in Early Access, I can tell that the style of the game will remain the same and not change. It's clear this is the style they want to go for and if you like this style you may enjoy playing but if you aren't into mindless running and shooting and respawning you will want to pass on this one.

- Skid Row Trash"
24377,Great game. Reminds me old good Arctic Combat.
24378,"Think about any other free FPS game out today and you have Black Squad. Its a much more recent version of all the other F2P FPS games. When you think free FPS you think overpowered weapons and the like. Thats exactly what Black Squad offers!

During my gameplay people were only using Light Machine Guns, a single assault rifle known as the 'Tar 21' and shotguns, most namely the KSG. The reason for this is because everything else is awful compared to these weapons. The Tar21 has the least amount of recoil Ive seen from other assault rifles, the Light Machine Guns actually have less recoil than assault rifles as well as deal more damage, and lastly the shotgun spread is way too close together. I get that its a shotgun and not worthless but jesus is it OP.

It doesnt just stop with the overpowered weaponry, theres headglitching and spawn camping as well! I played three quick matches on NA Channel 1 and every map was just filled with spots to head glitch. As for spawn camping, everyone gets invulnerability when you spawn, you literally spawn 50 feet away from the opposite teams spawn.

If these things were fixed this would be a fantastic game. Otherwise for now, its not the worst game if you can handle everything I talked about."
24379,"This game is complete trash. Just a rip off of Warframe, which is already a terrible game."
24380,cs:go and cod had a baby this baby grew up with all the weapons freom line of sight and the customization skills of a 12 year old 10/10 would i cancer strike again ?
24381,Just a good game! :D
24382,"If you're into ""TAC RELOAD"" well, boy oh this is the game for you. PS mk17 is cheese"
24383,100% waste of time
24384,"Not worth, as every other f2p shooter."
24385,"Honest I played almost all the COD games S&D, CSGO competitive since CSGO release only recently stopped playing.

This game has alot going for it, 

The Maps are very well done and I like the fact they made based on the game mode. Top Work here

The Gunplay is very rewarding while being very easy to pick up and play - Top Work Here
Graphics at times look really, really good the Ship map is excellent on max settings now graphics are only part of a game CSGO for example isn't a very good graphic looking game but they do enough! - Top Work Here

Sound is also very well done for a Free game and most importantly the competitive sound is here and its excellent what I mean by this is just how well you can use the sound to hear other players one wrong jump etc can be the end of that round for you. - Top Work Here

The Free To Play - This game has the best Free to Play model, the starting guns are very good giving players with decent enough FPS skill can do very well without buying new guns!
The Guns you can buy are very cheap and easy to get with just enough play time I struggling to 
understand how these guys want to make money? - Top Work Here

I know when I am addicted to a game is when I stop playing and couple mins later or the next day I wanting more, this game does that for me. I play only Demo 5v5 or 8v8 9/10"
24386,"Cannot recommend this game, why?

It tries to please Alliance of Valiant Arms's Snipey-Snipey and knife systems.
Makes out with BlackShot for the horrible damage, weapon leveling (""tier"") systems in hopes to call itself ""balanced"".
and
Lets old man Warface slap it's bums every now and then to borrow his ""attachment systems"", wich is simply a Lazor Sights for most weapons (shotguns and snipers excluded), Weapon Silencer (again, shotguns and snipers excluded), and a Grenade Launcher (agen, snipers and shotguns excluded), giving 0 damns about ""customization"" other than paiting the weapon, seriously, the game already crammed weapon mods on the weapons (like in Blackshot), you can hope to buy the ones with a 2-shot grenade launcher or use the ones that have ""cool"" aiming mods, can't have both.

The korean version is a bit worse (has more updates), but remains going out with three games instead of dating just one. not making it's damn mind to whom marry, hell, even the ping system is mixed!!

10 pings make a difference between teleporting when getting shot, or making the enemy teleport when shooting him...

go play Warface, BlackShot or Alliance of Valiant Arms, at least these games know what systems they want."
24387,"This game is simple and nice. Fun to play. The lobby needs to be improved though. One of the drawbacks is that if you went to inventory or other tab from matchmaking screen, in order to return you have to press Escape at least 3 times to return.
I know this is an early access but there are already a lot of hackers, trolling the game with aimbots and esp and some even don't die after emptying an entire magazine on them. This needs to change and I hope the devs will prevent those hackers to ruin the fun and gameplay experience of the legit players.

EDIT: I momentarily uninstalled the game for a few days because of high ping and hackers. Just installed it today to see that ping issue remains and there are more hackers now since I played last time. At least 1 -3 in every match who will kill you with one hit and will kill you again even with 10% health, your bullets won't kill him. I'm sure the Black Squad developers will do something about the hackers and the ping issues. I will still recommend this game because it is still fun to play despite you face hackers."
24388,"That's... Actually kinda bad. I mean, it's F2P, but does ALL F2P games should be like this?

It's blank, it's outright boring. Sound design is horrendous, the man responsible for it should be ashamed, even in CS (let's be honest here, gun sounds from 2000 aren't good) the sound of shots is better.

Hit-marker sounds are God damn awful! The sound of a headshot sounds louder than the gun itself!

Weapon balance is... Strange? I suppose? Oh, and a Tutorial in which you cannot open settings to turn THE GOD DAMN HIT MARKER SOUNDS OFF.

Jesus this game bad. It's literally just a remake of Point Blank with a tad bit of Warface poured in and just a little of CS:S on top of it. Is that ""The best F2P shooter on the market""? I think it's just an outright VERY early attempt to copy-past some of the most well known F2P FPS games into something called ""The best F2P shooter on the market"".

Realistic graphics? It's not better than CS:GO, which is NOT a standard for realistic look. Dynamic? Maybe.

Maybe sometimes it'll even become good. Now it's just a free copy of Point Blank/CS:S/Warfrace. Why won't you buy one of them? Same deal, but better"
24389,100% garbage until they region lock
24390,Годная игра лучше чем кс го
24391,"Meh...It's not terrible for a F2P. I would have liked this when I was younger. This might appeal to the CS:GO crowd but it's just not my style of FPS. Graphics seem outdated, UI kind of sucks."
24392,good game well developed
24393,"Combat Arms, Metro Conflict, COD and a CSGO wannabe. This game is just bad, bad graphics, bad mechanics and small maps. I don't even see how this game has a mostly positive, I guess it's because it's free. There is nothing new or special about this game, it literally is the same thing over and over. I was about to say I want my money back, but I just remembered it's free, thank God. The game is so bad that you only need to spend 10 minutes playing it to realize that it's horrible."
24394,Really good game!!! :D
24395,Good for a early access game.
24396,"I was hyped for this game, A tactical shooter with nice graphics! But no If Call of Duty is in any way tactical then this is still not, its tactical intervention (gameplay) and some other tactical shooter had offspring. The toturial is shit, maps are way to sided, stole loading screen from CSGO and you dont start with all the weapons LIKE WHAT THE FUCK. YOU GREEDY FUCKING BASTARDS! I know this is in early acces but still it sucks.

Edit: Will maybe change my opinion in the future but this is what i think now so dont comment bout it"
24397,Nerf KSG plz
24398,"I've played for about two hours and here are my initial thoughts:

This game really reminds me of the game ""Crossfire"", which is also a korean FPS game that's been out for awhile. The UI, having certain items for only a few days, things like that.

It's pretty generous that they give 200,000 credits in the beginning, just spend it wisely. I bought a sniper rifle and it was kind of a bad choice.

As some other people said, the whole sprint button with taking your knife out is kinda useless.

A thing to keep in mind though that it's fresh in the market so there may be many updates addressing problems like cheaters and hackers, server problems, etc. It's alittle refreshing from the monotony of CS:GO.

If you like FPS games and want to try something different, this isn't a bad option. Once it's pay to play I'm sure a bunch of hackers won't be around."
24399,"In all of my FPS gaming, this comes out to 'meh.' There's nothing new or unique here."
24400,I'm having fun.
24401,"I see potential in this game.
So much fun even if this is early acess I  wish this game good luck."
24402,"Solid Free to Play FPS

Still in Early Access more to come

Runs great on even very average graphics cards (Runs 100+ fps on my geforce gt 640 on medium settings)

Not Pay 2 Win"
24403,"this game is fuc*ing amazyng
:D ''tac reload'' :D
but why is only 3 secondary guns in this game?
anyway..."
24404,finally a fps game which is not pay to win and most importantly quite fun to play #wouldplayagain XD
24405,Good game.
24406,"I’ve been waiting for this game since 2014. I was very excited when they announced the NA servers. I played in both CBTs and in the Early Access.
I’ll try to make it as short as possible.

Pros:
+ Simple gameplay; Easy to learn
+ Not P2W; All weapons are accessible with game points
+ Grind isn’t bad at all and the game is very rewarding
+ Graphics are nice/OK but nothing too crazy
+ The game isn’t demanding (hardware)
+ The developers are very nice and friendly people

Cons:
- Too much RNG; Weapon spread is extremely horrible and there’s no logic behind it
- Sniper Rifles are way too overpowered; It kills a target the same moment you press the button
- No weapon uniqueness; About 80% of the weapons are copy-paste performance-wise (e.g. 1 damage increase for slightly less accuracy, firing rate and stability)
- TDM maps are too few, small, repetitive and boring
- Map design needs improvement
- Found a hacker headshotting everyone on sight and throwing dozens of grenades at once

Other thoughts:
• A sprint option is necessary (without needing a knife), it would make the gameplay better
• Animations may need improvement
• Game needs more maps, especially for TDM

I’m very disappointed in the actual gameplay and game mechanics. I wished this game would be unique, something like Arctic Combat with weapon uniqueness, variety of different maps and solid game mechanics(recoil/spread).

The game is still in Early Access so hopefully they end up improving every aspect of it. I will update if there are any changes. As of right now the game is giving me too much headache and boredom because of the RNG and the current TDM maps. My overall KDR is 1.9 so I’m doing just fine.

EDIT 8/7/2017: Removed the positive point regarding ""no hackers"". Today I found a hacker where he was killing everyone on sight and throwing dozens of grenades at once. The game is NOT hack-free."
24407,o yes
24408,GREAT GAME KINDA LIKE CSGO
24409,"it's great and addicting(kinda like Blackshot) and I appreciated it if they would have the spare time to create asian servers like in Japan, South Korea, or SIngapore. That way, us asian guys (particularly southeastern asia) can play it a little easier and not accusing of anyone cheating or hacking. The EU server is good, but I pity those guys that have very slow internet and have to play other games, since this is a very good and addicting game. Also, I looked at the trailer and there's female characters, is that going to be in the game or is it just to show off?"
24410,"[b]TL;DR down the bottom[/b]

**I have only played a few games, but without SEA or OCE servers it's a bit harder to enjoy for me. (The servers have nothing to do with my view on the game, just I might of played a little more if there was SEA/OCE servers.)**

[h1] This will be weird, I Recommend the game, but I honestly don't really like it. [/h1] 

I'm sure other people have come across this feeling too.

I've played all kinds of shooters and put stupid amount of hours in some of those as well. Battlefield, CoD (Mainly played CoDUO and the original CoD4), Titanfall, CSGO, Combat Arms, America's Army...etc etc. Just saying I've played a lot of [b]Different[/b] shooters.

Now onto Black Squad. I've had my eye on it for a little while but not really looking at it much due to the fact that it really looked like those general rough F2P FPS games...Combat Arms, A.V.A, Warface...And simply put, I really can't get into those types of games. (Anymore)

Black Squad is different though, it's honest (I could not find Any P2W, Devs seem good and communicative) and the actual game is pretty solid.
But my issues stem from what I ment earlier with those general F2P FPS games.

Black Squad is most definitely better then those in my opinion, but it still has this...[i]Cheapness[/i] Feel to it. I don't honestly know how to explain it properly. This is something that a lot of F2P FPS games have and I know that others have felt the same as I do about those games.

This is something I feel straight off the bat from just the Menu screen, it's very cluttered and has the same style as other F2P FPS games. It's not appealing (At least to me). Obviously with saying this, these things can be changed and the game is an Early Access game, so these things aren't 100% important right now, but it was just my first impression.

The few maps I played didn't feel like anything new...To be honest they felt exactly the same as other maps from other F2P FPS games and even some of the modern CoD maps. 3ish lanes, close quarters, intentional choke points and a couple spots for a sniper to sit. Which you can get away with and still enjoy yourself. (CSGO for instance does this and it's still fun) I don't honestly know if there are other types of maps, larger ones and what not, but really I didn't wait around to find out and didn't really want too.

Movement is really basic (Not always a bad thing). Also I don't mean they need to have sliding, wall running and all that crap. This is proper boots on the ground (GOOD) but the animations, sounds and the general 'Feel' of the movement feels really cheap and just basic...And honestly this is one of the things that have drived me away from games like this.

Gunplay...I didn't notice recoil really, even with another assault rifle I brought (in-game currency) had a lot of recoil, but barely enough to make me need to concentrate on recoil control. This can be a good and bad thing depending on how you like your shooters, I don't mind either...But it did add to that Cheapness feel I was talking about.
I didn't really notice any major overpower-ness with guns, my fights were won to who was quicker or had better awareness, which is what the game is about. It's a twitch shooter for the most part.


Now why the Recommendation? It does sound like I hate the game.

But that's my opinion on MY play of the game. That doesn't mean it's a terrible game.

The game itself is actually quite solid, probably needs some tweaking. Remember it's EA and also it's not exactly easy to balance Multiplayer games straight away.

There doesn't appear to be any P2W (I could be wrong, but I really didn't see anything P2W-ish) which is a massive plus on top of other F2P FPS games which has been plagued with this problem for a long time.

The Devs are actually communicative and in general...Decent. Which is quite rare these days.

I highly recommend at least playing it a bit, it's certainly got an audience...Not me, but certainly has one. It's quick to get in and quick to get out if you're the type of person who likes fast games. Perfect time-killer.


[b]TL;DR[/b]

The Good: Solid game, no P2W, Quick gameplay..Good time killer.

The Bad: It can feel cheap and can be pretty generic in areas.

The Ugly: Your mum."
24411,"A JOB HALF DONE, BUT NOTEWORTHY

I don't know whether it's just me, I really think you guys should re-work on your LOGO, a big turn off. Definetly it's not grabbing anyone's attention.
A big Thumbs Up for surprising me!! Never expected it to run on a Intel Potato Graphics.
Hope you guys will be adding more servers.
and ""TACT RELOAD"" Please remove this shit
"
24412,this is a shit game.
24413,.................
24414,"It had potential to be really good. Overall the game was enjoyable, UI is good. It's a more refined version of AVA if I must say.

But like every good game, there's always a big outstanding CON.
It's not ping locked so you will get 200+ ping players that can kill you even after you moved behind a corner. They'll also see you first before you see them when they come around a corner.

It's a fun game, no lie. It just doesn't compare to the current FPS games we have due to it being F2P. Just another cookie cutter shooter."
24415,"Awww man, this is crossover something between Counter-Strike and Call of Duty.
Good nice looking guns, didn't found any bugs so far and it's even Early Access. Great optimization,
this game will surely fast climb ladder in Steam TOP 10.

-Poor Matchmaking group of 5 players vs group of 2
- Needs better anticheat security"
24416,"So: the game is fantastic! It is not P2W at least. 

pros:

- Good community (at this time)
- Balanced weapons
- Nice optimisation
- Good graphics

cons:

- Adding things like silencer takes a little bit of time to master which key is for it.


Sorry for my spelling mistakes (If there were any.)"
24417,"pretty nice for a new game
"
24418,"I shot someone in the head 2 times and he shot me in my groin 3 times.

I died, he didn't."
24419,Good free2play game. I think this game has lot of potential in the future.
24420,This game is very good. It can run 30fps on Intel hd 2000 graphics and can run on graphics even better on that. My cpu is I3-2100 3.1 ghz and im running on intergrated graphics for now. I get about 30-60 fps depending on the situation but nothing lower than 30. The gamemodes like Assassination and Battle Match are fun and are worth the time. This game has alot of potential.
24421,it's real n word
24422,"The game just released for NA so it has a clear amount of issues, jump accuracy is a little way to high, alot of brazilians are in the game so you will find some games filled with 300 ping people, that are hard to kill, crouch spamming is an issue right now, some minor bugs here and there, BUT the developer is EXTREMELY active with its community on discord and tries to fix every issue we tell him, right now he is working on getting a new server up and running and ping locking NA, after that he plans to fix crouch spamming and see what he could do about the jump accuracy, the game is COMPLETELY FREE to play and NOT P2W unlike many shooters, i suggest you download it and give it a try

The cringy voice acting makes it just that much better ;).

"
24423,Asia or South-East Asia Server Pls :)
24424,"So far the game keeps crashing with the ""anti cheat error"" on the tuturial. If the game dev does see this, please fix it. Edit* It still having an error on the anti cheat code and preventing me from playing the game."
24425,"Pretty cool game, would highly urge you to play this game!"
24426,Game is very borin and crap. Videos look more fun to watch then play. Game as nothing then watch the video shows. Crap
24427,Very fun fast paced game hopefully it get's bigger. and it's very easy to run.
24428,"i have played many free fps games......BUT this game is  the most weird game ever.
1.the graphics arent very good even in ultra.
2.there is no recoil.
3.this game is a bad combination of cs go and battlefield with some elements from cod
4.the animations are extremly bad
5.this game doesnt requiere any skill you just spray 
6.the music is weird and is the same every time
BUT, if you dont have the money or a decent pc and you want to play first person shooters you should downloaded because you can have fun with it but nothing else.also if your like me with a good pc but you just want a free first person shooter to play, you shouldnt downloaded because compared to other games like csgo, tf2, cod and battlefield is bad.
YOU SHOULD KEEP IN MIND that this game is  in early access and it might become something better in the future but for now i dont recommend it"
24429,is k
24430,ruin my day
24431,Nice game
24432,Really good game it have some bugs but its olny in early acces
24433,I recommended this game after a while and I think that's a good coop game
24434,Substandard COD clone :(
24435,A mix of cod and cs.
24436,great game
24437,"Pretty fun for a F2P FPS. Big lack of P2W content and only cosmetic in random boxes, there are no weapons exclusive to those who paid.
Pretty tactical and maps are okish but I'll admit some Weapons are pretty unbalanced, not that much of a factor if you're skilled.

Not comparable to the paid competitive game but I'd still recommend to anyone who want a F2P Shooter."
24438,Fun F2P fps game that i havent noticed is that muched pay to win because of the weapon states are very well done. would rate 8.5/10 for this game
24439,"This is possibly the worst first person shooters I have ever played.

- Snipers and Assault Rifels have the same amount of damage ✔
- None existant recoil ✔
- Terrible maps✔
- Terrible spawns✔
- Terrible damage ✔
- Un fun gameplay✔
- Spawn camping✔ 

This is just scratching the surface, believe me or not."
24440,"Not a bad game, though could do with some improvements. I don't mean to be that guy when i say 'you get what you pay for' seeing as it's only free to play but still. A little bit of false advertising when showcasing female soldiers in the field. Also i haven't come across any australian servers, i'm austalian and i find it hard to play on american and european servers. Plus hip fire recoil is a bit ridiculous but hopefully they'll fix it. Was really looking forward to playing as a fem-fatale soldier but i guess i was shot down a dream. Overall it's a good game but i'd look a bit more into it first before downloading :)"
24441,"I do not reccomend this game, even as a free to play fps. It is a poorly made exuse for a game, there is no recoil, yet the game does not play like an arena shooter, it attempts to be a ""realistic"" fps, and fails horribly, please do not waste your time."
24442,Worst FPS I have ever played.
24443,"Good gfx and Game play in free 

The lobby system need improvement and Weapon Customization too."
24444,I kill ****
24445,"Battleye support, dedicated servers, great shooting mechanics and amazing netcode. Black Squad is a military first-person-shooter game using the Unreal Engine 3 to show realistic graphics and dynamic visuals. Absolutely no Pay-to-Win. Welcome to the best F2P shooter on the market.

Realistic graphics my ass, not only is this game very ugly too look at it the gun play is terrible too.it's really just a knock counter strike so i guess thats all it has going for it."
24446,"Personally enjoyed this game, I would really love to see more weapons in the games and more servers. If you could make a non-broken kick system, surrender etc it would be really cool, just make it in your own way. 

The hour and a half i had left of my day to play this game was totally worth it at 250 ping, considering I managed to learn a lot about the weapons. I would highly reccommend this to anyone really, my sh*t laptop could run this at low settings at a stable framerate. 

One last note, try not to make this so similar to call of duty, because it wouldn't be as unique as it already is. I would love to see a competitive feature in the game, where if you leave you would be temporarily banned and you had to do a mission for example, the assasination thing but everyone has similar skill level. 

Pros:
Graphics - For an early access game, great job.
Settings - Highly customizable although I would like to see another feature next to ""hold to aim"", called hold to crouch. Some players may prefer not to toggle crouch, incase of pressing wrong buttons etc (yes it's happened to me)
Literally NO Trolls/cheaters/toxic players (From my experience) - I just found that the 250 ping that everyone in my team was averaging was worth the excuse ""lag"", literally NOONE has said ez to me. 

Cons:
Limited servers (Ofcourse will be updated soon)
Long one - No tutorial on teaching people around the menu(s), I had a bit of issues figuring out how to invite my friend on steam. 
Tutorial could be longer, optional to the player maybe?

This was a quick review but if you're into a counterstrike/cod feel game with its own features, go for this free game, especially if you have a potato (-32gb ram)."
24447,Good First Person Shooter game!
24448,"why i cant play game 

invalid approach [5][8]"
24449,F2P so what do u expect
24450,Very good game more than what I expected
24451,"overall this is an amzing game and here are my reasons. reason number one is the graphics and the movement are beyond good they are at levels with the battlefield and call of duty franchises. reason 2 the game is easy to use and it is thoroughly explains what to do.reason three is the clans and events are a great idea which will help the game become a very good game for comunity which big games find hard to eachive even years after being released. although the game has got lots of ups there are some downs which let the game down, here are the flaws. flaw one is the interactive screen althought i say the game is easy to use the only place it is hard to use is the home screen as it is very full. one way they could improve the home screen is to remove some the welcome to black squad and the box below it and possibly make the bar which is at the bottom to the top so it is smooth for your eyes to look acroos and not to look across and to the bottom right corner.another flaw is the weapons as the grenade launcher crosshair and the grenades in general look similar to the ones seen in the call of duty franchise so if possible on the full realise you change the cross hair colour or design and change the grenade look or add a texture such as a fabric slooped around it to differ the look. apart from that this is an amazing game and should be in any gamers steam wishlist as it is fun and the maps are better than any in battlefield one and the new call of duty and for that reason the creators should continue to but great effort in this game and i hope to buy this game when it is a full game"
24452,Why you should play this game? no pay 2 win. Guess that's more than enough to reason to start playing.
24453,Best fps since SF/AvA. Very nice gameplay and playability. This game was great and had even bigger potential as long as the devs would listen to their playerbase. They did at the beginning. And then they just started ignoring their playerbase and focused on adding skins and copy pasta stuff from korean version.
24454,"if you like simpler (no complicated special moves,...), fair (no pay to win) FPS games, this one is good."
24455,Great tactical and fun game. very enjoyable and runs well on the worst pc's XD. cant wait for more content in future updates.

24457,"I was expecting it to be a little better , this game just feels like one those old flash games on websites.

"
24458,I hope developers wont fail.
24459,random headshots i dont get it
24460,"This is more or less a free-to-play Call of Duty, which is absolutely fine. It's easy to get in to and the matches aren't that long (~10-15 minutes at most). Like any other F2P-game, there is a shop where you can buy new weapons and stuff, for in game currency or real money, but there's really no use in doing so as the default weapon is the best weapon. It's if you want to use a shotgun or a sniper rifle instead, but otherwise? Nope. I know, I know, it's still in Early Access but still, why have the option of buying optional guns if they're worse than the one you get by default?!

The graphics are fine, not the best but absolutely not the worst either. The sound does what it's supposed to. The controls are as they should be, besides the run button being the mouse wheel by defautl... what? Also, that's the only way to use the knife. Odd decision, but alright, I can live with that.

Overall, if you're looking for a first person shooter to kill the time for some time, this is alright. You won't be playing if for a very long time though."
24461," awesome game and lot of weapons ..but you must know a secret ,dont get annoyed by other players cause you will hate this game"
24462,"Don't waste your time...- The controls are bad, the recoil is ridiculous and of top of that, the maps lacks of life they are so small and simple. Besides, it's only possible to run when you are using the knife otherwise you can't basically and so on."
24463,"Basic F2P FPS, but not P2W. 

The gun mechanics and maps are similar to CS:GO. The game is very fast-paced and action is always around every corner. Some of the problems in other F2P FPS games are also present in Black Squad. 

- The time to kill varies way too much, headshots are OP and bodyshots are useless.
- The recoil is non-existent for some guns but insane on others.
- Some of the maps are designed unusually and spawnkilling is way too easy.

Black Squad is an enjoyable game if you aren't expecting much."
24464,"I love this Game
But i am in Vietnam, i play game with high ping ~200, i hope you open a Asia server for support Asia player :"">
Thank you very much !"
24465,"probably the best f2p shooter out there right now no p2w stuff just skins preety much 
and you actually need skill to kill someone 

*TACT RELOAD*"
24466,"[h1]Black Squad is one really good F2P game I've discovered.[/h1]
The basic weapons provided are good enough to use, yet you can already buy two new weapons of your choice with the points given at the beginning of the game. Not bad.
The requirements to play the game is not high, so even having ""wooden"" PC could handle it finely.
Though I don't understand why there are people giving thumbs down just to say this is P2W game which it is obviously not.

Enjoyable gameplay with nice graphic.. some may not like it, but this is how it should be.

At the same time, this game somehow is quite similar while it sure does reminds me of the times I used to play [i]Sudden Attack SEA (SASEA)[/i] which has no longer exist as the server has been shutted down in year of [i]2015[/i]. I was only being competitive in that one FPS game and no others could entertain me even the slightest (due to my different interest). To be honest, this game revives the spirit back in me.

Unfortunately, I am in a [b]distant region[/b] where I could not have proper ping to play smoothly. I am informed that this is still an Early Access Game, but I do really hope they will add [u][b]Asian server[/b][/u] in the future for the players to play more happily. I'd love to support the devs when able if that happened.

[b]UPDATED : Asia Server is up for test and is currently running fine. Such kindness and effort is well appreciated.[/b]"
24467,"CS:GO / CoD hybrid. If it needed to be done, these guys did it. And frankly, it's very good."
24468,"This game is a joke! Why? Well, one word to describe it: [b]amatorial[/b].
The only reason this game has so many positive reviews is that it can run on a potato. Period.
Let's see what's wrong with this:

- It's made by koreans: nuff said.
- Graphics: LOL!
- Animations: please, we are in 2017!
- Maps: very small and ugly.
- Servers: lags, freezing, teleporting...
- Weapons: [b]no recoil[/b]. No... recoil! It feels like some kongregate/unity fps demo! Basically, you have this piece of plastic in you hand that shoots [b]exactly[/b] where you're aiming until you run out of ammo. This can be acceptable in games like Paladins, not here!
So, what happens every single time you shoot at someone?
1 - The enemy dies instantly (headshot) or....
2 - the enemy avoid... [b]avoid[/b]... all of your bullets and you die instantly (headshot).
- Sound: O...M...G! Sounds are terrible! I don't know where they downloaded those libraries. By the way, every time you shoot at someone it feels like you're hitting a sandbag, and the volume goes up from 100 to 2000 %!!!

From what i read on reddit, this game is quite old (2014, possibly?)... Please, don't let it suffer... Let it die once again!"
24469,"Objective: Knife a box 10000 times until it breaks
It's quite revolutionary"
24470,Its a really great game. But i would love more open maps. The maps are really closed which is kinda annoying.
24471,I love this game so much :D !!!
24472,"its a COD like, CSGO like, BF like, with broken hitbox hf"
24473,"Great game, cant belive its free to play game.. looks great, feels great , by far best FTP FPS game on Steam!  10/10"
24474,"Really good game. Worth a try hope later this game will be more awesome.
TAC-RELOAD!!!!"
24475,Please create South East Asia ( SEA ) server.
24476,"What a game. Most of the weapons on the store are purchasable using the currency you earn by playing, and the weapons are good so there's no disadvantage if you don't spend. 

Pro's

Reasonable recoil, not random and stupid like battlefield 
Not P2W, they actually told the truth
Runs well
Good servers

Cons:

No achievements
Menu system to get into a game is ok at best, needs a redesign in my opinion.

Also, the currency is called gold, yet is silver? xD"
24477,"fun reminds me of kill zone 
"
24478,why the fuck no ASIA/SEA server?
24479,This game is great. highly recommended
24480,"Honestly It is one of the best F2P First Person Shooters around at the moment. It is very well optimised for all systems. The gameplay is fast and action packed and it is near perfection already. However, there is a need for more secondary and melee weapons as there is only one secondary and melee weapons. Overall, I think it is the best Free to play game that I have played since Blacklight Retribution."
24481,"Worse than War Inc.
Worse than Warface.
Worse than every single FPS game that I've played. (and there were a lot, trust me).

+ Find matches fast.
- Unbalanced weapons.
- 4 Currencies???
- Only very few maps.
- Toxic community (everybody is shouting hacker and EZ all the time)
- Game favors those with high ping. (playing on low ping, get killed after diving into cover by people with 400 ping)
- Spawn camping is 75% of the matches.
- Insane grind to get weapons (about 150 matches required for a weapon)
- Graphics are 2002 era.

I feel bad for the korean and indonesian community that they have to put up with these garbage games."
24482,Stay away from this garbage.
24483,"The only thing i can relate this to is a mix between Cod:online (without all the weird variants) and Counter strike, this game takes the fast pace gameplay of COD and mixes it with the skill based gunplay of csgo and other tactical shooters. overall I feel this game brings together the things people like me engoy in a Fps: Earning (In game currency used for weapon purchases.), Responsive and fast Gunplay, and A somewhat realistic health system (No auto regen, heal using medkits). Overall this is my new favorite tactical shooter and i hope to see great things come along for this game over time."
24484,"Very poor quality, Outdated graphics, poor map design, P2W elements, poor weapons sound, repetitive gameplay, no tactics, no team work only fast paced run and gun. bad mix of CS/COD."
24485,"Its good, but skip the normal TDM mode, start with the bomb mode. It's much more fun. Otherwise high TTK makes less sense."
24486,"This game has its flaws but overall its really good. I would say its on top of f2p fps right now. 
Pros:
- Has good hitreg
- Not pay2win like someone said (Every gun can be purshased in game currency, no lvl reestrictions)
- Skins that just look amazing but dont give us any advantage over someone with normal gun
- Devs are listening to us and making changes in game according to players feedback
Cons:
- no server browser for now, only quick matchmaking
- little amount of boxes purshased by gold(only 1 with 3 different knives types)

Overall 8.5-9/10 

Like I said this game at its current state is better than most of the f2p fps titles out there, mostly cause game is not p2w and its fun, at least for me. Try it yourself. 

"
24487,epic map and cool guns updates are coming and keep coming more
24488,"1. Unreal 3? Can't see that
2. Terrible maps. Spawn campers are normal
3. Weapons... Really unbalanced bullshit."
24489,good
24490,Good game!!
24491,lol
24492,WHY IS RUNNING BUTTON YOUR MOUSEWHEEL????
24493,"Neat.

No AU servers. 

:("
24494,"Game is great and feels great and looks great. Somethings need work
But otherwise its really good for a free to play game."
24495,This game is beyond fixing and RNG.
24496,"Don't get mislead by the whole PR speak in the description of the Store page. This is your typical F2P FPS. 

Apart from the Weapons and Character models, everything is low-effort, masked behind Early Access. 
For the time this was already in development and live in Korea ( at least 3 years!), the Maps, UI and Textures still look like they came straight out of a UT 2004 Mod more than a decade ago. The Sound in the game is sloppily recorded and lacks any depth and variety. There were zero changes made to footsteps, voices and weapon sounds since more than 3 years ago. 
If they can still claim Early Access after this long, the people responsible should not be trusted. 

Why they are advertising it as a military shooter with great shooting mechanics is beyond me. You can interchance it with any setting and theme and it would still be the same uninspired and bland mess. 
Hip-fire is as strong and accurate as ADS, a lot of animations are either not there or choppy and unreliable, the movement feels like sliding on ice, and for the claim that they have dedicated Servers, you still get hit behind walls with massive delays. 
Similar to GitS: First Assault, the ballistics and bullet spread are completely randomized and you don't have any kind of feedback that is intuitive. 

Again, this is not something that is newly in development. It has been around since at least 2013. 
Don't fall for the claims that they would listen to the community. If they had, the game wouldn't have been stagnant since the first public releases years ago. It's the same publisher that brought you gems like ""Alliance of Valiant Arms"" and ""Crossfire"". If you're not into the worst kind of generic F2P games, ready for a grind and bugs that will likely not be fixed, steer clear."
24497,This game is pretty well done even if it's only an open beta. I recommend you to try it
24498,"It may just be me, Or the fat sweaty fucks who got onto the game at 3 am, But, Don't fucking play it, It's a CS:GO wanna be, The sniper fucking scopes suck, Bullets curve as you run side to side, In TDM, Expect to get spawn camped by the enemy, No matter what side you're on. You think you got into a good game, Wrong. You SOOOO VERY much so did not. You think Any other game mode will be better, NOPE, You play on the 5v5 Bomb mode, Someone pulls some bull shit way to kill you, and you're out for the rest of the round. Think it's all over when your team plants the bomb and they kill you quick, Nope. Enjoy the fucking disgusting sound of the defusal kit that everyone magically has, I'm gonna try this game again when I wake up. Otherwise, Fuck No I do not reccomend this game. Game's been out for a day and there's already fucking sweaty nerds who fuck the game over."
24499,"Game seems good and very nice looking for F2P,But the first game i join there is blatant people cheating,they headshot you  every time and they seem to know where you are comming,classic case of ESP and aimbot.

Devs need to get a decent anti cheat."
24500,Good Play style! Is a Soild game I hope it stays high up in the steam list.
24501,"Game would be great if they got ride of the ""scope snipe"", as long as the player is inside the scope hes dead LMAO ya right"
24502,The game is decent . but the ping is hell . pls make asia server then i consider about this review
24503,"still long way to go. 

right now it not have any anticheat on it, sound effect weird and bug, map design and fov feel awkward and finally ping 300 is too OP to play with.

it seem battle eye anticheat that dev promised us seem to be nothing but a joke. because right now there is no update date of it any more. plus the more they maintenance their server the worse lag be.

honestly, if you like any game that have ""the same"" game play like thi sgame you better play csgo instead."
24504,Overall Its Decent FPS game . Worth Play
24505,"There's aspects of the game that need work, but it just went into EA so it's understandable. I think it's fun, and has the potential to be better than CS."
24506,Really promising game. Really entertaining to play and really nice mechanics for early access. Hoping for a bright future for the developers!
24507,yes
24508,"Awful

-terrible ui
-terrible balance
-terrible sound design
-terrible game modes

-pretty good texture work though"
24509,this game is awesome
24510,pretty darn good
24511,"Nade spam fest 

You play 5v5 and each team has 15 explosions

Have fun getting exploded"
24512,"This is a very good game looks great if you are in to fps (FirstPersonShooter) games you should get it

it does not have voice chat
but it has a good variety of game modes
awsome weapons and weapon sounds
really good graphics
good animations 
OVERALL IT IS A VERY GOOD GAME YOU SHOULD GET IT IT LOOKS LIKE I SOUND MAD BUT I DONT JUST MAKING YOU GUYS KNOW ITS HERE

"
24513,"Team Death Match is such a fun game mode, all you do is go to enemy spawn and camp them and you get free kills which helps your KAD get higher cuz TDM is such a fun mode."
24514,"This game is a literal copy paste ripoff of all the other 'F2P' shooters on the market. If you value your sanity, go buy CoD4 instead."
24515,Arctic Combat died for this
24516,generic
24517,"I think the game is great so far, the gameplay is smooth except for one thing, the snipers are absurdly easy to use, please fix this devs"
24518,This reminds me of Warface before it went to s@#!. Very solid shooter and not pay to win. Maps could be a little bigger though. Still it's fun.
24519,This game is amazing thats all i have to say bye
24520,"the time to kill is too long, the game is just not that fun."
24521,"When the game begins, instead of having all the bullets we have with one less, please do something with it, it is annoying , thank you 

How can I only play on the map I want?"
24522,Really fun f2p fps and surprisingly very balanced at the moment with no pay to win aspects at all and since it uses battle eye it has practically no cheaters at all.
24523,"Guns are interesting and balanced, shooting people is satisfying. Movement is fluid. No P2W and very polished experience (game's been out in Asia for a few years and is very popular over there.)"
24524,Why no Asia server? :( Well the game is nice. Just hope there will be Asia server soon!
24525,Best f2p rn
24526,Reminds me of Soldier Front 2......in a bad way.
24527,"i hardly can request this game to other people due to it's constant camping and getting killed at every corner i would take, and with the hackers wallhacking it gets kinda annoying"
24528,"i only played 3 games and left. the shotty is just flat out stupid. it will one-shot you everytime! played a team full of shotties and its just stupid. people say its about skill but i beg to differ! yes, there are many better players then me and i accept that but the kills were exremly fast and just felt not right. i put a full clip into someone and he turned and killed me in what felt like one shot. i know the game is in early stages, but right out the gate felt very bad. saw many leaving games over and over. i really hope the devs do something about the shotgun or itll simply ruin the game. and im assuming there are no hackers yat? if there are hackers already, again i hope the devs pay attention. this can and will be a good game as long as devs do some nerfs and pay attention to what us gamers are saying. ill give it a thumbs up because i feel the game can and or will be good if the devs are active in the community. for now i will not play it until maybe a patch or the next update and come back to see if things change."
24529,"Decent game, smooth fps.
Kind of unbalanced teams.
Seems like hackers are about </3

Similar to blackshot style play
No AK, M16 or M4?

Updated July 1, 2018:
Brings back crossfire and similar game memories~
No lag compensation, no NA West sever so laggy...
Good for a few rounds or an hour... campy maps.
Wouldn't play this game for 1k+ hours.
Free boxes, pruddy great more skins for summer $$ oki.
Cheaters, laggy, unplayable to fun."
24530,"Pros

-Fun
-Entertaining
-Not pay to win
-well optomized for an early access game
-active devs who actually care and put in work into the game

Cons

-menu might be a bit confusing at first but thats pretty much it


Many people complain about hackers but I haven't run into a single one yet, I have seen however people who are really bad at the game calling anybody who has a decent score a hacker.

give it a try, its a fast download and overall the game is good

7.5-8/10"
24531,"If you want to play CS:GO 2....This is it, kinda. The health is too high, the movement feels kina clunky and the menus are a mess.

This game really is just a Counter Strike clone but you can aim down sights. That's about the only difference. The recoil patterns are just as absurd and make no sense, like CS.

I was hoping for something different and not something I paid $15 already."
24532,awesome game!! its fun  to play the game only if you good at it!!
24533,"This game didnt give me instant crippling depression thats a good start.


But in all seriousness a strange yet fun mixture of CSGO and Call of Duty, good gun models too.






After a few more hours into this game I ended up getting crippling depression. The guns and accuracy in this game is completely inconsistent. Getting kills in this game feels more like luck rather than skill. A lot of guns need to be nerfed as shotguns can 1 shot you across the map."
24534,Good game
24535,"Damn, this game is old now, I tried it first time in Korea 2014 , since this game from South Korean Game company. This game is crazy shooter, pure gold and never get me bored back then. 

its just came out on Steam lets see how it will work here and how long it will last. 

At this moment need Oceania servers and Asian cause Eu, N.A and S.A servers are just 400 ping stable. (pretty shit ) 

Game is good"
24536,"crap f2p game, again they put to much emphasis on all sort of useless crap...."
24537,YES THIS IS THE GAME
24538,"Another FPS game on the Steam Store except its free. So the F2P players come barging in with little to no experience and going ""Uh I just got shot at, so I'm just gonna spray and pray"". While it was fun bullying them with a K/D of 38/8 on TDM, the amount of casualness was what made me uninstall the game. I'm just glad that games like Overwatch are pay to play to keep these F2P's out of professional competitive."
24539,"Really fun game, best F2P FPS shooter I've played. This game is simular to CSGO (which I hate), but the reason I really like it because it has a CoD feel to it too in terms of shooting mechanics. 

I'd say it's a much more fun game than CSGO. All FPS games > CSGO."
24540,I never review games but I have to tell you this game is sick!!
24541,"it's just a bad cod clone, very random recoil"
24542,Why is the ping in NA 100?
24543,"Fun game. Similar to CS:GO, but free. It has a few of it's own twists, mainly purchases are done outside of the game and you start with a full loadout. Unlocks are farely cheap, and there seems to be some deep customisation. This could really be a hit game, Especially if it develops the amount of customisation in other similar games. It does have a few optimisation issues, but this could easily be resolved in the future. I hope to see it keep improving. Well done devs, keep up the great work."
24544,Most fun i have had in a free to play game
24545,"This game is really well done. The best free to play call of duty style fps.

P.S. Developers please dont get greedy and P2W this game has so much potential dont destroy it."
24546,amazing game wish it was a little more like cs:go
24547,It's alright if you like trash
24548,Its better than CSGO
24549,amazing f2p fps all should try it
24550,Would be great if Asia Server added
24551,Really fun
24552,"One of the most laughably-bad, skill-less shooters I have ever played.   Guns all shoot the same, you don't have to aim at all, movement is fast by default...it's a total meat-grinder with zero skill requirements to win.  If that's what you're looking for, then have at it."
24553,very solid game for a free to play. does have in game transactions but they are not really needed to have a good experience. highly recommend to people who like the feel of csgo/battlefield. very good game
24554,I need help fixing blacksquad not launching pls help
24555,THROWING GRENADE!
24556,"The game is great.
Graphic,system,maps,skills, no bug at all ( didnt see any bug at the moment ) and weapons.

The main problem is SERVER.
We need SEA SERVER.

overall i give 8/10. 
i gonna give 10/10 if they make SEA SERVER"
24557,Pretty good game only thing I'd want is sprinting but I know thats not how the game is built. Would recommend.
24558,checked the game... don't bother...
24559,"I used to like this game. It seemed to be a great take on an already popular mode, 5v5 plant/defuse the bomb, but the lack of support they have towards its players and how bad they manage community cups has ruined it for me.

                    Updates have been bad since the start, and when it's a good one, it's always late. Every single update comes with new skins, and now they're even lacking on that, instead of making skins with good different arts, they're just one new good art with various colors types plus a bunch of shitty ones nobody cares. 

                    Community cups are always something fun, it's where players gather to show their skills with their team, or just have some fun and see how far you can get in this competitive environment. But how they've been supporting it and which organizers they support is really weird. Their ""support"" is just basically giving BS Coins (currency used to buy skins) and a calling card to the winners, and even though those two things are great for the winners, the communities actually don't gain much from these tournaments, they just grow a bit without getting actually better. If these communities raised money to get some fancy skins to the winners, it'd be just the same. Also, who they support is something really weird, no one knows what you *really* have to do to get into this partnership with them, and they're really slow at supporting more tournaments in regions that have a good demand (mostly because they're not interested in helping organizers get better at managing these tournaments, as said earlier), plus after you have this ""support"" you can be as shitty as you want towards your staff and smaller teams that they'll do nothing about it.

                    Overall you'll certainly encounter some technical problem that you'll have to go to support for them to tell you to ""verify your game's integrity"" and some more bullshit that (mostly) never fixes anything, a horible UI, bad map design (which they'll never try to fix), and many players that think they are professionals at the game. Furthermore if you want to play in some tournaments you'll be fine, but if you worry about your community, or want to have one by yourself, then you're screwed.."
24560,"Very p2w. This style of 'free' game shouldnt exist in 2017. It's like Warface, you have to pay for weapons, and the weapons last DAYS, so you would have to repurchase them. This is such a done-to-death formula of a free shooter, that it's laughable that these devs actually think this game is going to grow, which it isn't. It's just a quick money grap. Instead, just invest af bew bucks on CS:GO, or some other shooter.

I do NOT recommend this game one bit."
24561,ez top kek game
24562,I like it! best free to play in a looooong time imo.
24563,VERY GOOD GAME!!!
24564,"Really fun game. No P2W aspects everything you pay for is just skins. You can buy weapons without selling your soul for it (By logging in once a day for a week you earn 105k and if you play 10 hours over the whole week you earn another 85k enough to buy any new weapon) The developers listen and look over community feed back and made tons of great changes from the closed betas. UI is pretty shit though, tutorial is meh and you cant change your settings during the tutorial. Also make sure to look over your settings before playing a game because some settings arent right. There's a lot of bs reviews saying theres p2w weapons due to the fact that grenades are timed but then they blanket it with weapons are timed which not a single one is. There are a lot of QoL issues that should be fixed but will probably be fixed from what the devs have shown."
24565,Bland generic fps
24566,Dev are headed for a good start. Recommand this game only because it's free. Need optimisation. Feels like a warface rip-off. Although gameplay is little bit hard.
24567,Fun F2P shooter. Has alot of potential!
24568,":)
"
24569,One of the best FPS games in Korea has finally made it to the west and It has a fair f2p business model? Sign me up!
24570,"Pros:

- Polished Gameplay
- Guns feel good
- Sounds okish

Cons:
- Very weird and clunking running around
- Probably the most forced tutorial ever made
- The sound are a little over the top. 
- P2W ( the grind is real ... )
- Dated graphics"
24571,"Played the game and it was good, everything is fluide as you play no glitch or so.

Graphics are great game mechanics is awesome.

Just missing running and attack without changing weapon

see my live stream

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9ZwXsffwes&feature=youtu.be"
24572,Have you ever wished Call of Duty was pay to win with random elements of counterstrike included? Me neither.
24573,Guns recoil total joke
24574,Its an okay game.
24575,"It's a decent shooter, definitely generic but sometimes people want simple. It's free and has lots of servers worldwide. Thankfully they listened to feedback and got servers in SEA. Has potential, it's early access so hopefully they're ambitious and try to bring more maps and better sounds to the game."
24576,"Based on my first impression, this seems like a competent game, but I can already tell that it's gonna end up being just another one of those games that want your wallet with weapons that degrade, random boxes, and more of the usual tactics. There are some other minor annoyances I found, such as the amount of flinch on hit, and how the weapons do so little damage at range.

It might not be pay to win, but it certainly will be pay to use other weapons. Also, another game that locks grenades behind the in-game paywall.

The EA dlc is nice, though.

Edit: Okay, fine. Black Squad has its high points, such as most weapons being able to accept a silencer by default or having sights screwed on, which is actually a nice feature. The guns have a pretty nice sound to them when you fire, and are actually pretty accurate. The sniper rifles feel like they have punch (The starter rifle two shots to the body, and one of the purchasable ones 1-shot.) My only gripe is that shotguns feel rather inconsistant in terms of their damage, but that could have just been my bad luck kicking in. Movement is smooth, without lag, the servers had good ping, and I was able to find games quickly without delay.

If I could rate the game a Maybe, I would."
24577,Controls are kind of wonky. I had to rebind most of the keys but other than that the game is okay for a F2P.
24578,"So out onto the servers and...

Cheats galore!

The game is supposded to have an anti-cheat system, but it doesn't work 100%.  You have some very clear cheats being used by regular players and no admin to punish.

Still can't recommend anyone play this cheat-filled game."
24579,"""[...] amazing netcode.""
""Absolutely no Pay-to-Win. Welcome to the best F2P shooter on the market.""

First time I started the game, I got asked to play the tutorial for some rewards. Of course I accepted. The game was loud as hell, the graphics were okayish, the mouse sensitivity horribly slow. But during the tutorial you can't access the settings. Great.

At least I got my reward for finishing it. A grenade and a smoke grenade. Both limited to 7 days of usage. I'm not saying that the game is P2W - apparently it's not, in it's current state - but we don't know how it will develop. Every F2P-Shooter I know has become P2W sooner or later, so I'd be careful here.

UPDATE:
Apparently only grenades are temporary. All other weapons are permanent. However, you have to grind a lot. 192k for a sniper rifle - you get about 1k for winning a game.

Afterwards, I started my first game and something was terribly wrong. Everything was flickering, even the crosshair. I took a look at the settings again and noticed that the refresh rate was set to 20 Hz. It was hard to overlook because every game is usually set to 60 Hz.

Next thing I noticed: The servers are too slow. You can take cover before an enemy opens fire and you still get several hits afterwards. This is just a no-go in a multiplayer FPS. I play CS:GO and even their 64 tick matchmaking servers feel too slow - this game is even worse.
Looking at the scoreboard, there are ALWAYS players with pings over 100 or even over 200. I can't emphasize enough that this shouldn't happen in an online shooter.

Other than that, it just feels like a regular casual F2P-shooter. Team Deathmatch is completely unorganised and too open. It feels strange when you're walking towards the enemy spawn point and suddenly an enemy pops up from behind you - basically from your own spawn. I don't know if the map was just constructed like that or if my team just sucked. Probably the latter.
However: I've only played Team Deathmatch so far, so don't take my first impressions of the gameplay too seriously.


tl;dr:

As of now, I can't recommend the game at all. Temporary weapons, terribly slow servers, casual gameplay.
However, there's hope that this game will become better and the developers at least make the impression that they listen to the community. I'll give a thumb up for that.


UPDATE:

Alright, I tried the other game modes now. ""Demolition"" is basically the bomb defusal game mode of Counter Strike. So it's the only game mode which actually requires skill. You can play it either 8vs8 or 5vs5, both without friendly fire.
I played both variations twice. Matchmaking was great: While I got matched with people on my rank (or lower), the enemy team always had higher ranks.

I tried to help people via ingame chat. I wrote ""go to B"" when the bomb was at B. I wrote ""just defend the bomb sites"" because people kept pushing forward alone and died. I wrote ""stay with the bomb"" because 2 people always went other ways and got killed. I wrote ""hold shift to sneak"" because the enemies always knew where my team mates were. Did anyone listen? No, of course not.

At first I felt like crying, but after the third game I just stopped caring and started laughing at the stupidity of the community. I guess that's just a huge trade-off you have to deal with in F2P games.

Then there's Battle Mode. It's a bit like Battlefield. On small maps. Without vehicles. Without fun. After a while I just gave a fuck about the objective and started sniping, that was quite entertaining. Imagine playing AWP in Counter Strike, but without requiring skill and without the ability to shoot through certain walls.

I couldn't try VIP mode because I just cancelled the queue after two minutes.

Oh well, what else could I have expected from a F2P game?

Skill-based game modes are impossible to play with randoms. Team Deathmatch is still impossible to play because of server-side lags.

""[...] amazing netcode.""
""Absolutely no Pay-to-Win. Welcome to the best F2P shooter on the market.""

That's it, I'm out."
24580,"looking for a free counter strike like game,well here it is...HAVE FUN:)"
24581,10/10
24582,how the fuck do you get in a game
24583,"If you enjoy camping this game is for you because there isn't much of a reason to move more than 10 feet from your spawn. Just wait for COD to come out or play it if it's already out. People don't move, they camp corners because of no health regen and you'll be spawn camped 98% of the game. Its like R6 but worse. Skip this title. Dying player base and 90% of the time you get bots for teammates, not actual bots, more like people who have never touched a shooter in their lives. Trust me, I have 40+ hrs on this game and Im now sick of the same BS. Uninstalled by the time you read this."
24584,The cry of the soul: ADD OPTIMIZATION!!!
24585,"On max it lags on my R9 290x ...... and looks about as good as CS:go which runs at around 150fps give or take, aiming directly at a bots head with a 1 hit kill sniper and not gettinga hit register at point blank..... what? 

At least this game isnt super premium bs..... but its still extremely half assed...."
24586,first minutes in the game and i fkn love it well made   but plz don't make pay to win
24587,"This is the GAME.
Have watched some gameplay's of the KR version back in the days and was put off to find out that it wasn't
avaiable over here in the EU... and i was lazy to get fake Korean accounts and such so...
but its now here and BAM, why i love this game:

-Optimized UE3 still goes strong, 1080p on 180$ PC Build
-Very Skill Based gameplay
-Its not P2W and won't be P2W, seriously if you call this p2w, you either are some really trash player with shit aim
or you just don't understand F2P games
-Devs do listen to the community. Asked for an hold to aim option, the community got it (and quite fast too)
-BattleEye AntiCheat protected so minor chances to find cheaters if none
-Very very gore-ish, dat blood splatter when headshooting someone plssss or even your gun covered in blood

Definitely worth the try. Best F2P so far and hopefully it won't be dying anytime soon"
24588,"nice game for now only one thing missing 

- dmg given to enemy must be shown when we get killed;"
24589,"Bored after an Hour. Maps are Micro, which is ok for this ""type"" of game. Im an avid supporter of lean feature which isn't here, and with all those corners everywhere kinda a shame."
24590,trash
24591,Awesome hacker plug in
24592,"Can't say I enjoyed this game much. There are many free to play games out there, and this one is just slightly different from a few others. If anyone's played Ghost In The Shell, it's very similar but Squad has much less rewarding gameplay/gunplay.

Just grab a shotgun and run at people, particularly the KSG, so you can 1 shot people at most of the ranges you fight at.

Play Ghost in the Shell instead. Way better."
24593,"get game, buy ksg. never use any other gun cause its broke as fuck and wins you first place every game GG EZ

24594,Awsome GAME to the next lvl simple and good mechanics!!!

24596,had more fun downloading the game LOL
24597,fun game
24598,Like it!
24599,So far so good :)
24600,"like call of duty style on the ps4 , very fast action."
24601,"I played 117minutes of this game and in that space of time I've sincerely enjoyed it very much. I believe it's a cross between CounterStrikeGO, Battlefield and CallOfDuty, 3 of my favourite games and this game really suits my style of gaming."
24602,"It’s a solid shooter no doubt, but its exactly like a half the other F2P shooters out there. And the statement ""Absolutely no pay to win"" is a blatant lie. You can purchase 'Medals' with real cash to buy better weapons that your fellow man will have to grind hours and hours for to earn the hundreds of thousands of silver to buy the same gun.

Oh and if you live in Australia. Prepare for lag. Its one of those 'Split second reaction games' where if your pinging even 100 behind your enemy, you are at a serious disadvantage.
Give it a go anyway, its free...but be warned.

All this said, I'm still giving it a thumbs up because its a solid game and if the devs mind their manners with the pay to win stuff it could be very enjoyable for a lot of people."
24603,"Not too bad for a free to play. Runs very smoothly but after 1 match I became bored. Managed to play against a speedhacker in the game so the anto-cheat system is not good at all. I wouldn't recommend it but if you do play, do not expect much."
24604,Shoot em up for free!

if u want to buy a gun with there in game currency (GOLD) the chepest gun witch is just a trash veckter is 96000 gold the best player in my lobber got 985 gold that means if u where the best player there it would take u 100 games just to get a trash wepon if ur trash (u know u are thats why ur looking at this game) then u will olny get around 600 gold every game 
                                                                there are way beter FTP games out there

24618,Well Its FTP and has ABOSOLUTELYLLYLYLYLY no P2W.. what else can i say
24619,only played for a a little while but i gotta say this is the best f2p fps  ive played ever its well balanced devs listen and it actually takes skill to get anywhere that and there is no p2w aspect to it.
24620,garbage AF P2W
24621,"Boring version of csgo. I hoped it would be great. The trailer was good, the game is boring and trashy. Sorry."
24622,"Would i reccomend it in its current form?
no

Does it have potential? I guess any game has to some degree
Maps are very small, w/o much detail, and you are in no time in the enemies base
In general, the layout isn't very good either, lots of nasty little corners to hide in, or on. 

However it runs well and the ''netcode'' seems to be quitte good

Here's some gameplay

24623,"Nothing but another ""Free 2 Play"" FPS game which is identical to everything else that is ""Free"". No new feel to it, the mechanics are really bad and not to mention the maps are really REALLY small. Barely any movement to be done outside spawn before you get fucked over.

Nothing new about it in any way."
24624,GG

24628,"honestly im trying to love the game but with weird gun mechanics that fire random patterns to the overpowered shotguns to the constant terrible ping with BR players in Na servers . This game is a work in progress

UPDATE : GAME has not changed . 4 months so far and NA still doesnt have ping limits. THe gun patters are still non existent or totally random . My ping is shit ( NO NA WEST SERVER)  so im either forced to play in NA with 150 ping or in the ASIA with 250 ping. Lack of balancing and game improvements .Mainly the only updates is testing  for the EU server and weapon skins with a gun/map here and there. I wanted this game to suceed but it is stuck in a identity crisis ( CSGO or COD) The lack of competitive play with even basic ranking is not there. You can be matched with lower skill noobs who dont even know what they are doing and with people who think they are ""pros"" . Honestly becoming a cash grab for the devs(very expensive skins[ $20-30} for skins really ??? and loot boxes that dont hold shit {besides stupid nades/smokes).) instead of trying to bring the BS competitive scene to US and everywhere else. IF they dont give what NA wants, this game will end up dead ."
24629,"the game is kinda nice reminds me of cross fire and combat arms a little bit
currency is hard to get,,,, same as xp
just add more items to the game make it all pretty and simple and you have a master piece seriously
i give it 7.5 / 10
(because of graphics and lack of items)"
24630,"CoD + Counter-Strike + Free-To-Play (some P2W, but not excessive) = this

Update: So this game has a CoD mode, 2 variants of CS, a Rainbow Six Siege mode, and a Battlefield mode. Pick whichever suits your fancy. Also, the game gets much better once you find a weapon you really like. For me, it was the SR47."

24635,"If you are casual player, the game is perfect for you:
·Alot of weapons
·Animated Skins incomming
·Alot of maps and diferent modes
·Good recoil and bullet spread patterns

If you are professional or competitive player:
·You need <20 ping to do well ingame vs another good players
·The netcode is bad, you will get constantly killed 0,5 seconds after the enemy shoots you and you are ALREADY BEHIND cover (not talking about wooden wallbangs, it's lag kills). There is some weird peer2peer mix in the netcode that makes the gameplay really frustrating."

24637,"This is a great game! It was released into early access which means it will just keep getting better. The devs actually give a shit, unlike a lot of free 2 play games out there. They talk with the community and also listen to feedback. This game is free, you have nothing to lose except a few mouse clicks. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed. 

I also purchased the founders pack. It gives you no advantage at all in game. This is not a pay 2 win, not even a little. I only purchased to support the devs.

I was also able to destroy people with the basic weapons so people need to git gud. I've also never encountered a hacker. Downsides are some bugs, such as the ""white screen bug"" at startup. I really think this game should get better netcode though. Other than that, its a really good game, show it some love."

sorta like cod mashed with counter strike, and it can run on lower end pcs
recommend a try"

24644,I absoluetly love this free game its so amazing and fun during beta testing is when i played and i loved it the game made me feel like i was in the battle it helps i have a good headset that blocks out noise from around me i strongly recommend getting this game so amazing thank you creators of this game
24645,"On the frist point i liked the concept it had some csgo kinda feeling and i was like sure lets try it. nice intro and it runs pretty good. the it happend i joint an team deathmatch and in that frist game i played there was one guy flying and killing everyone. this game is not even that long out and already cheating kids. then i was like fuck it another gamemode i did an 8v8 and there was an guy killing everyone from the spawn. i was like seriues another fucking cheater ??? so i left the match and rejoint another hopeing this one had no problems. and ofc i got an match with that same flying kid -_-.
on that point i was done with this game and wont touch it again until u guys fix the god dam cheat bullshit"
24646,"Awesome game, highly recommended. Have yet to see anything wrong with it."
24647,so good !!!
24648,"Overpower, Hack or Pro?

A few days ago when first start playing in this i hope there is no Hack.. but after a few week play this game i noticed that there is a feww player was to everpower to kill it took 3 people assist also not die. There also player who their gun was to everpowered but it the same gun the all of us use now which is 1 or 2 click already die. i dont know if that player very pro or hack or macro. I still positve btw. The most interesting when u see player playing TDM get 70 kill with only 2 die is this logic? or ery pro? this matter need to discuss and need to take action. Demolition instead with such beginner rank suddenly have the God Experience hahah and know all the people hide and camp is it waller? or pro? if this getting worst     it will be GG to Developer. i will recommend it to my friend and experience itself. YOU need to solve this issue"
24649,"Holy shit.

Take CS:GO and make it faster with (IMO) Easier and more forgiving gun mechanics. Its on a better engine too so it just feels better to play. Can see myself sinking a lot of time into it. 

Also. Its FREE for an amazing game. Why not try it out?"
24650,its so laggy and  i have 1050ti
24651,"Honestly it is just what you expect for a free fps like this, temporary skins, no recoil, weapons that fire in the speed of light, no balabce at all in the weapons, snipers are like strong pistol, stupid maps, etc. ect..

A Free Fps like I said.

2.8/10, played 1 match, wouldn't play again."
24652,GOOD GAME!!!

[h1]General Impressions[/h1]
Tac-Reload! Tac-Reload! Tac-Reload! Tac-Reload! Tac-Reload! Tac-Reload! Tac-Reload! Tac-Reload! Tac-Reload!

Black Squad at its current state compared to a year ago was nearly built for a full-fledged Free-To-Play unlike its competitors. There are four different modes to play, a wide assortment of guns to try out, and a variety of different skills to use. In terms of the game development process, this was a breath of fresh air that like any other Free-To-Play in its maturing years, has become stale compared to its other releases over the last few years. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Gameplay-wise, the [b]time-to-kill is pretty decent[/b], but might have felt shorter due players ""gitting gud"". I personally like being given a little more time to shoot people, and this takes care of that. What I do hope for the future however, is that they will be able to strike a balance on this. You are given an AR, an SMG, and a Sniper Rifle from the start, and at least from Day one, they appear to work pretty well. From what I understand, this is no longer the case in the coming months prior to transitioning to VALOFE. 

There are your run-of-the-mill modes that you can see in any other F2P, TDM, & S&D. They offer 16-player and 10 player modes in S&D, while there is a lesser-seen Escort mode. Our main contender of the game here would probably be their Battle Match, which allows up to 32 players, and has so far been a ""Destroy the enemy fort"" map. 

-- Edit as of 11/23/2017
In playing through some of its patches and shamelessly logging on to receive the attendance rewards, here's what I have to say. A lot of the patches so far have not brought as much depth as I would have hoped. I'm still very much in love with the central premise of Destruction Mode, and hope to see how much more they can extend on it. [b]As of 2021, there are a total of only six maps, which offer this function. one of the maps are primarily seasonal. [/b]

Weapons do have recoil, and though it may not feel that way with the default set, you will definitely be able to sense it once you try a QBZ or any of the AKs. Some weapons may have a different category in title, but their weapon recoil/behavior oddly feels the same. This gave me an impression that there hasn't been implementation on it just yet, but we'll have to see what NS does.

One of the more prominent changes was the addition of weapons without the grenade launcher attachment. Would you exchange 10 additional rounds in magazine capacity to have 40/160 bullets? That's what you would get if you bought an AK-47 instead of the AK47-GL. 

[h1]$$$ . . ?[/h1]
Business Model-wise, the game benefited the consumer in the past. Under VALOFE, you get your typical F2P pricing, which unfortunately is on-par if not worse than Aeria Games. There are four main currencies to concern yourself, but it seems that the only way to get a new weapon under this publisher is to gamble your way to the top. They even restricted the weapons that you can purchase to a crate, so if you want that AK47, you get to gamble with 1-D,7-D, and permanent denominations of all the restricted weapons. 

Medals take slightly longer to earn, and are not as easy to retrieve. You can get medals from reaching a week of attendance, levelling up, having a lucky get from crates. Medals open up your arsenal to more unique weapons, with most of them having the grenade launcher. They're definitely something you should invest more time in researching over a gun that works for you, but if you know you're going to put a lot of time into this game, try going for the melee reskins.

BSCoin / Bullets are the premium currency. The only way I've really seen usage on either of these is to buy beautifully reskinned weapons at a premium price (with BSCoin), Spending them on weapon crates and cosmetic character skins, or to convert it into gold / medals. 

[h1]Bottom Line[/h1]
I hope NS Studio can stand against having content come out within some kind of schedule. Their release might be successful, but you kind of have to wonder where it will be in three months, like all of the Free-To-Plays that have flopped since. Time will tell whether this game will succeed."

Game can be fun if you know how to play fast paced shooters.
Anyway i dont see the game entertaining me for too long. there is definitely gonna be grind elements later on. Nothing new really for a F2P FPS. Still i'll recommend the game cause it runs smooth as a baby's butt and it's fun it's own way."

24668,"Really a nice game, combination of CS and COD, good looking graphics, but no SEA server.
Pls need a SEA server"
24669,"Ok, so to start this out, i've been playing since the first CBT on the day it dropped on steam, the game has actually been out  in KR for quite some time (roughly 2 years). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niNjtiYGSdg They've made other games like S4League (which is pretty dead now), Crossfire, and A.V.A.

All games which i've enjoyed throughout my teen years, though this game somewhat puzzles me as to why they decided to build the game from the ground up but it was probably done to help keep NA players in. This game as a whole can be seen as just another empty ""CS clone"" But that can be said about MANY, MANY other games. Just about any other game can be called out like this but i don't see any direct correlation outside of some basic F2P gameplay elements and paid lootcrate systems. This game has some nice potential as far as F2P goes as long as the devs keep everything cosmetic for paid items and grindable for any statistical weapons, as well as listening to the community through discord (which they have done by adding a south america server and more guns from the KR version on top of optimization fixes).

If you are looking for a game to ""do more with the FPS genre"" go play lawbreakers or titanfall 2, dont moan and bitch about a game thats been out for 2 years in another country, the fact that this game is dated should be the tape to shut you up about it being a clone because this was the norm before CS:GO came out, A.V.A would be proof of that since it came out in 2009 in NA, well before CS:GO. CS clones are everywhere, wake up and get that stick out of your ass.

Outside of that heavy blanket statement its a fun game to play if you are in to those basic fps reaction shooters. If you cant stand them then i'd be looking somewhere else.

Pros:
-Easy to pick up
-Grindable skins and guns, nothing behind a paywall except for some skins but *shrug*
-Devs have open ears with the community.
-Optimized fairly well for EA, but still needs work. PUBG effect but not anywhere near as bad.
-Gun balance is pretty good for a F2P game, we all know how that often goes.

Cons:
-Advanced sensitivity options still not labled in the slightist
-TTK isnt consistant across connection differences
-Medal systen not explained for newer players or at what thresholds you get them.

There are a lot of awesome weapons too. The only way making this game better and the most important thing is to add an decent AC-System and make a bunch of differences with the WEAPONS not just a model that replaces the other one and has no other stats yet the same.
[This game could be better]"
24678,"Black Squad feels too much like a Call of Duty game. Instead of trying to set itself apart by trying to be different, it seems to copy the awful Call of Duty style game so they can get those players to switch to this game, and buy items.

Firstly, the main menu is confusing as hell. They definitely need to streamline it, and clean it up. Then, I get into game, and it was fun, but frustrating. The hit registration seems off, as I thought I hit many headshots, but nothing (maybe I am bad?) Then I saw that the whole gameplay aspect was Call of Duty. Hit markers, small maps, and guns. Why did they copy the most cancerous gaming series ever?

It is a Call of Duty style free game, you can try it out, but I don't recommend it."
24679,"This game has terrible ping lag, it doesnt even let you hold aim and lacks in gameplay."

24691,Awesome game. No pay2win at all. Really fun and fast paced.
24692,"Played one match of TDM which consisted purely of spawn camping as you always spawn in the same place.

Guns sound like toys and handle like trash."
24693,Just another f2p cheap feeling poorly translated shooter COD / CS GO with standard gameplay.
24694,Great game.
24695,The way we shots is the worst thing ever & Anti Cheat always making me disconnect. Nope.
24696,"A mix of generic f2p shooter and cs 1.6. No bullshit mechanics, not even any recoil really, just a simple skill based shooter that can get addictive.

It plays very arcady and fast paced but its also very smooth instead of clunky (small things like switching weapons for instance). The graphics are also very nice, especially the weapons, and it is fairly well optimized.

EDIT: 2 years later, still a great game."
24697,"""Hey should we make a genre changing game thats unlike any other FPS on the market.....Nah fuck it lets just remake a shittty version of counterstrike, make it free with tons micro transactions and boom we will be rich!""

24700,">Good game I really enjoy it over the overrated sheep game called ""CSGO"".

>The Netcode in this game is ... eh. I really want them to work on the bullet reg.

>The community so far is great , they try to help other players out ( you can find them on Black squad discord channel)

> Some weapons are harder to control than others , I feel there is still no balance in what gun you're using. For example , the recoil on the SR 47 is way too high even if you crouch tap.
If you tap more than 4 bullets , your bullets will be hitting the sky. 

> The game devs are planning on adding Voice Chat , clan wars , and server list for all the different matches in the future.

> Overall I rate this game 10/10 it's currently in Early Acess , you just have to give it some time and help the devs out by giving them feedback ( Found on their discord channel ).

24704,"Sure this game is 7/10 free2play game but 90% of player i met is hacker and it bad cuz this game just out too. What kind a hack you ask? well it all kind of hack wallhack, Aimbot, Sometime HP hack, Try it if you want but dont play 5vs5 or 8vs8 cuz it only hacker who got bannd for csgo that play it. People who want to enjoy the game most of them stay in TDM even then you met hacker but hope one of your team is one too. 

P.s i know i bitching about Free2Play game but it too much hacker to enjoy the gama at all."

24707,Really great FPS with good mechanics to be potential an esport competitive
24708,"[PING]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! pls admin help me ! 
asia:400 
na:300
eu:200"
24709,"Best competitive F2P FPS.
No pay2win."
24710,wanabe cs go with better graphics
24711,"Just the usual free 2 play shooter which has a pretty solid call of duty and cs:go gameplay.
I don't know why a lot of people are hyped about that game, it does not play special in anyway and feels like every other free 2 play shooter. Although it seems not pay 2 win at the moment its not good, it might change tho."
24712,"Allow me to begin this review by stating that I have supported, loved and enjoyed this game ever since its beta. This game was an interesting and certainly promising shooter that took clear inspiration from the counter-strike series, and despite the awful English translations and terrible voice acting (it was too hard!), and very clear oversexualisation of female playermodels (they all have visible cleavage with jiggle physics? They all wear short-shorts, have pale, blushy faces, and big lips?) and very obvious bias to specific weapons (especially ones tied to DLC), I kept playing and supporting, and I even own some of the rarest skins in the game.

So let's talk about how the devs have treated the game.

Terrible updates. Nearly always no content, just skins and paid content.
Lootboxes. Which cost REAL money. Which have a 90% chance to drop you LIMITED-TIME skins, not PERMANENT. You heard me! You might get to unbox a weapon skin that lasts 24 hours! Or you'll get a smoke grenade, or a frag grenade, or maybe even a boring spray or some in-game currency. The chances of actually unboxing a skin are subliminally low.
Because of this, many people would rather use the Steam marketplace, and as such, skins can be very expensive if they are rare. Makes sense.
But now the developers have decided to, out of literally nowhere, disable Steam trading, and the Steam marketplace. Their reasoning is the most moronic thing I think I've ever read in my entire life. And I quote:
[i]""The complete removal of market & trade of Black Squad items is the only option left for us to achieve our ultimate goal to keep you playing Black Squad.""[/i]
Sorry... what? The incentive is that removing the Steam inventory is going to... keep me playing the game? Do you actually have brain damage, developers? What the hell hit you in the head?
To top it off, they also just sold the game to Valofe, which is a company known for making pay-to-win free games. 

So not only have they removed a key aspect of the game (stock market, trading), but they don't add any content to thsi game other than really disgusting over-sexualised female playermodels and paid skins. The seasonal events haven't changed once (other than adding new paid skins), and we've only had three maps added to the game since its initial launch - none of which you actually ever get to play because they aren't even in rotation! The game began dying a long time ago due to the developers mistreating the game, and now they're sticking a sword in it and killing it. 

So yeah, this game is dead and I will no longer be supporting it.

Screw you NS, and screw you Valofe."
24713,"Keeps crashing on start
"
24714,ok Im impressed with the graphics. Im running on overclocked GTX 1050ti. above 100fps always <3
24715,"This game has very good potential. It's like a good CoD and CS F2P hybrid that's not P2W, unlike the most of the F2P shooters out there on Steam. The developer listens to the community, which is VERY good. You can find matches quite easily right now, and the gamemodes are quite fun to play. Give it a shot, it's F2P after all."
24716,Oynaması zevkli mi bilemedim reakabet ortamı var ama kimle kim arasında gitgide kitlesi azalıyor skill2 kadar surmeyecek ! baska alternetif yok !
24717,good graphics and simple best part its free and can run on any pc
24718,Changing my Review to negative until they start communicating with the community again instead of releasing cosmetic garbage nobody needs.
24719,"Love this game. Developers have been very receptive to community opinion and have made great updates to try to please the community, Well done guy and girls!!!!!"
24720,The game itself is good but it would be way better if I was not the only person in the match with less than 200 ping.
24721,Simple yet awesome first person animation. (most of them)
24722,"This game is the worst game i have played since a long time.
Mannnnn what the fuck?!?!
This game has bad graphics
even worse movement 
and the worst weapon handling that I ever had to experince 
1st free game that I removed from my Steam Library lol"
24723,"This game may be just a another free to play shooter, but it's been said it wont be pay to win. Because of this, I see some potential. Anyways, the developers are trying their best to listen to all of the most important complaints. Minor issues like you can't hit anybody, that's kind of your problem. I can hit people pretty well. This game was already released in Korea, and is pretty popular.

*Pros:- The Developers - They've literally listened to a lot of the biggest problems starting from launch. At launch, a lot of people were getting errors, and the devs helped to fix these problems in their discord.
          - Not being pay to win
          - Enjoyable if you're not extremely picky about every little thing
*Cons: -Some balancing issues with guns which will probably be fixed
            -People's ping, though you just gotta be in the right server (NA, SA, or EU)
            - Those people who will pick on anything that annoys them about the game, like seriously it's just a free to play early access game. What do you expect? Take that into consideration 
              and set the bar for yourself.
Conclusion: Enjoy it for what it is. It's not gonna be so amazing, but its also not going to be so bad. If people say that this lacks content, then whatever, just the early stages. If people say the gameplay is shallow, whatever, then that's just expecting too much of a free to play game."
24724,"Even though it's still in early access, I've already fell in love with it! Having played the CBT made me want to play it even more. 1 word to describe it, AWESOME!"
24725,I swear I thought this game was about the LA riots. I'm sad that it isn't.
24726,ok
24727,Great game!
24728,"Black Squad is a cool free to play FPS

Pro:
- Free to play
- Graphics are ok
- No pay to win cash shop
- Skins

Con:
- The scrore rewards kills way more than the others. Even if you die many times you will still have many points. Many people just run blind into the enemy and try to get a kill before they die. No tactics just a rambo style.

- Full of cheaters

24729,"Fun game, reminds me of SKILL SF2. Still needs work though!

Pros: 
- Looks really good
- Runs smooth, toaster friendly specs.
- Huge potential
- It has skins, that's always good (to some extent)
- Fast paced without sprinting (you have to run with a knife like in CS:GO)
- Movement feels good 
- Animations look really nice

Con:
- You get decimated by enemies that have the exact same gun as you (still fun if you manage to be smart about it and trick them or avoid them)
- Guns are very different so it might take you some time to find the ideal one
- Scoping with a rifle is really painful to do, the sensitivity zoomed in is 3x slower than without scope (or at least that's how it feels)
- Most rifles are useless to be honest, only the the following are good: CZ Rifle, Blazer SniperRifle and Type 95 (i got the chrome version forever, and it's very good)
- You have to turn on the laser pointer and install the silencer every time you respawn and that's very annoying
- Switching to something else and then to your gun will not allow you to shoot for about 1 second, and every second is important during battle, please remove that. (i don't remember any game with that ""feature"")

Besides that, all good. 8.5/10 , would sprint with a knife again!"
24730,Best Classic FPS :v
24731,"Free to play traditional military fps. Has similar feel to Soldier Front 2, COD, AVA, etc. 

The admins and dev's listen to the community at the moment and implements changes accordingly.

"
24732,"It's Call of Duty and Line of Sight (another FPS F2P game) on crack.

Sadly though, it's pay 2 win. The pay 2 win weapons can be gotten by crates, you have the option to buy 'Bullets' with real money in order to buy these 'crates.'

Other than that, it has 4 gamemodes; Team Deathmatch, Demolition, Assassination and Battle Match. I only played Demolition since it suits the way I like to play. You need to 8 rounds to win in order to win the match. It's like SnD in Call of Duty or normal CS:GO competitive. On the plus side though, the variety of weapons is pretty good. It ranges from Assault Rifles, Submachine Guns to DMR's.

Besides the pay 2 win weapons, there are a few dumb things about this game. 1 is the silencer. If you put it on, you can still be seen on the map. That just doesn't make sense. 2 is the hip fire. You can easily spray at someone without even ADS on them.

I do have to give this game a 'No' recommendation just because of the pay 2 win aspect.

Tips:
- You run faster with your knife out. That's your 'sprinting' since the game doesn't have a dedicated sprint button.
- 'Walking' is your bestfriend. No one can hear you.
- All guns have silencers."
24733,its really fun
24734,"Was waiting desperately for a new free to play shooter to play. I discovered Black Squad years ago and was thrilled to see that it finally will be released on the European market. 

I played the Alpha and both Closed Beta Versions and so far I have to give props to the developers for doing such a great work. Very good communication with the Community thanks to the Medics/Neobricks. The major things that the community mentions are getting implemented, it takes some time but the game seems to be going in a good way. 

[b]My personal PRO's:[/b]
- NO PAY TO WIN, real money will only give you skins. No super special high damage low recoil weapons, just skins. 
- BattlEye as Anti-Cheat. If anyone of you played Skill Special Force 2 you may know the pain. Every second game at least one Cheater and no improvement in sight. Since BattlEye is one of the best AC currently on the market I'm glad to see it supports Black Squad. 
- Variety, for an Early Access there is already a good amount of variety. No matter if it's Guns, Game Modes or Maps! 
- Free DLC's with plenty of guns
- Crosshair Customisation for free (*cough* not like Sf2 where you have to pay for it *cough*) 

Update November 2018: We have e-Sports baby, ESL is available since some time now, starting with the Go4 Cup and a Demolition Cup. They will have a Tournament/Major Cup next year with some prize money, let's see if we will also get a lan event in the future, would be nice. 


So, whoever of you might be looking for a nice free to play shooter: TIHS IS IT.
I can only recommend you to try it out, it runs very smoothly for me on ultra settings and I definitely will get addicted to it."
24735,"worst fps game ever

24738,"Been putting in some hours, Definitely a good game.
Currently no P2W, hoping it stays that way.

UI is kinda ugly, hope it gets worked on & also Some hitreg issues.

- Good Graphics (Even a potato can run this game at the lowest settings)
- Everything can be obtainable through in-game currency ( No pay2win )
- Skins are the only thing you need to pay for 
- Everything is balanced
- Great devs 
- Classic Shooter
- A lot of different game modes
- Takes skill , so spraying like crazy wont work
- Very competitive

Cons:
- All assault rifles should headshot kill with 1 bullet 

Overall a great game , as a lot of potencial and I did play the korean version and since then i've been waiting for this game. With the right steps it could become the 2nd most fps played after csgo"

Pros: 
Devs listens to the community.
No random recoil.
Game is focused on pure skill not RNG.
Very fast pace and gives you time to waste.

Cons: 
Hackers need to be dealt with which I think the Devs are working on.
Hip Fire Accuracy 
Some description for guns can be worked on."

its really tactical and teamwork is a big part of gamemodes like Demolition and Assassination

apporved by me :P"

The mechanics is good, played the beta and seems to be very promising in the future.
Hopefully this game will have ESL ladders and some cups for the clans and not just ingame clan ranking.

For devs:
- famas recoil should be fixed.. increase it a bit.
- more maps for clanwars.
- remove the VIP mode.. its useless and no one likes to play it.. add other mods :)

So far so good, thanks for your effort guys to make us great game and for free :)

24793,"Really, really good game, good f2p fps i want to play more!"
24794,"This game is okay, essentially cod boots on grounds but free to play.

I have enjoyed my somewhat short experience on this game but i think for what it is could do with a little bit more balancing.

The developers seem to be extremely enthusiastic and proud to release this game, which they should be - they have given it low specs so everyone can play, the graphics are great at ultra, gameplay is very fastpaced and has a fun feel to the game.

What I wasnt a huge fan of was the collision present between teammates, it would be okay with 4 or 5 but if you are in a TDM game and trying to snipe a choke point everyone essentially feeds the other team. maybe a little tweak there could improve it but my opinion.

I definitely recommend this game, its free, plays extremely smooth, and is a good time killer. just be aware that you will have to fight from your spawn most games and train in the art of getting out of the way of grenade spams every 10 seconds lol.

+rep to the devs again because the time and effort is shown in the product which isnt even in its final form! keep it up devs!"

24801,"Looks promising. Love the open communication so far. Keeping their playerbase in the loop. If they can't say something, they let us know. Ex: Couldn't elaborate on the technical issue that caused the delay. So they let us know that. Again keeping us in the loop. Seems they listen to their playerbase. Already a clan system. They want the game focused on being skill based and not luck based. I like that. Played in the cbt. It looks really fun. I like it. Gives this a thumbs up so far. Keep up the good work and communication with your players!"

24803,"Great replacement for its korean blueprints like combatarms, point blank, crossfire and such shit i haven't mentioned. These are things you should never google."
24804,A generic F2P FPS that does stuff right. Recommend.
24805,Really fun to play :)
24806,"There is a cheater in almost every comp match and the developer/publisher is just terribly ignorant and offered a 50€ in Game Box now that does not even have permanent stuff.
So yeah... avoid this game and this dev. in general."
24807,"Muito tempo atrás, no closed beta, recomendei esse jogo. Pois bem, agora em 2020 volto a jogar, acreditando que teria uma grande surpresa ou que tivesse alguma mudança. E não, não teve nenhuma grande mudança, muito mal adicionaram alguns mapas. A única ""grande"" mudança foi a adição de uma loja P2W dentro do jogo, nem deveria existir a moeda GP (que você adquire jogando) dentro desse jogo, já que não serve pra nada, os itens mais porcaria são os de GP."
24808,"Very promising free to play game. Not p2w, highly skill based. Focused on gunplay and not overpowered gadgets."
24809,Good game and nice weapon graphics
24810,">not pay to win 
>Bryan is sexy
>great game 

11/10"
24811,Really good game
24812,"Full skill based game, no RNG and no aimpunch. Dev's are active with the community and have promised cosmetic only premiums.

Also the anti-cheat is battle-eye, no XIGN bs.

Probably the best F2P FPS so far."
24813,"Stable servers
Weapons have nice balance
Maps are a bit claustrophobic, but you get used to them
Developers are listening for feedback from the community ♥
Multiple language support
Skill based game with recoil patterns^ ^
No pay2win, you can buy skins with real cash

Approved *thumbs up*

24815,Comp scene died nearly at start soo -

24817,"So I have been playing this game for years now (KR Version) and during both halves of the CBT and I have to say thus far, it is absolutely amazing. I have never seen a company in which the developers are so involved with the people. They literally took advice from every single person that took a survey, read through them, seen which were most popular, and implemented those changes!

Now for the actual game. The gameplay is very smooth with no lag at all, ping wise or system wise. It has many maps and over 20 guns to choose from (all are different)! The gameplay is very fun with multiple gamemodes (of which my favorite is Battle Mode because of its classes and how unique it is!). I expect many more great things to come during the early access, I highly suggest you come on and give this amazing game a try :)"
24818,"This game has many reasons that I feel like have made the 90 hours have played enjoyable. First no bullshit it has no jet packs, no characters with different health or speed, and no pay to win. In my opinion, it's Counter Strike's  biggest competitor for the pure military shooter. If you want alterative to Counter Strike or can't afford it this is great."
24819,"Awesome game! The publisher listens to our feedback. Best F2P FPS game IMO.

Edit:

The game turned pay to win last patch. The game is still in early access a year later. Eventough most patches are cosmetic items.

Edit: 
I still don't like it that items like the AK zhuvok as paid only. Competitive mode and Go4's prove that the publisher is starting to take their game more seriously."

24824,"Please be careful people when purchasing random boxes!!!

I personally bought 175 G36 cases going for the death bringer and got 10 duplicates and only 3,700 battle coins.
I asked other players in Discord who bought 175 boxes each and 3 others did not get any of their rares either.  All of us got roughly exact same drops in gold, battle coins and medals.  Please be aware of this before purchasing random boxes as the drop rates are extremely low (I know some people will 1 box guns but in the overall people are having horrible odds getting the actual rare gun from the boxes)

Other than that though, this game is fantastic and deserves to make money, just don't personally agree with the ridiculously low rates on skinned guns."
